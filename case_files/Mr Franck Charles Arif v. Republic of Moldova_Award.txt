INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES.-

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the Centre on the basis of the BIT,
which entered into force on November 9, 1999, and the ICSID Convention. The
dispute relates to the delayed or prevented opening of several duty free stores,

and to the breach of an exclusivity undertaking.

Claimant is Mr. Franck Charles Arif and is hereinafter referred to as “Mr. Arif”

or the “Claimant.”

Claimant is a natural person having the nationality of the French Republic.

Respondent is the Republic of Moldova and is hereinafter referred to as

“Moldova” or the “Respondent.”

Claimant and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Parties.”
The Parties’ respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on

page (i).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY.-

On August 3, 2011, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration dated July 29,
2011 from Mr. Arif against Moldova (the “Request”).

On August 23, 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties
of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited
the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in
accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution

of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (“Institution Rules”).

In the absence of an agreement between the Parties, Claimant elected to submit
the arbitration to a Tribunal constituted of three arbitrators, as provided in

Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

The Tribunal is composed of Dr. Bernardo M. Cremades, a national of the
Kingdom of Spain, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Prof.
Bernard Hanotiau, a national of the Kingdom of Belgium, appointed by
Claimant; and Prof. Dr. Rolf Knieper, a national of the Federal Republic of
Germany, appointed by Respondent.

On December 2, 2011, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of
the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (“Arbitration Rules”
or “ICSID Arbitration Rules”) notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had
accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have
been constituted and the proceeding to have begun on that date. Ms. Alicia
Martin Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of

the Tribunal.

The Tribunal held a first si

 

ssion with the Parties by telephone conference on
January 31, 2012. The Parties confirmed that each Member of the Tribunal had
been validly appointed in accordance with the ICSID Convention and Arbitration
Rules. It was agreed inter alia that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be
those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be
English and that the place of proceedings would be Paris, France. The Parties
agreed on a schedule for the proceedings, which was embodied in Procedural
Order No. 1, signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal and

circulated to the Parties.

As agreed at the first session, Claimant submitted his Memorial on February 15,
2012. On February 27, 2012, Claimant submitted correctly numbered electronic
copies of exhibits C-89 to C-95.

During the first session, Respondent indicated that it would appoint counsel by
February 15, 2012. On March 6, 2012, Claimant noted that Moldova had
officially selected counsel in February 2012, and requested that counsel for
Respondent be introduced into the record. On the same day Respondent

indicated that it would soon be retaining counsel and noted that this delay would

have an impact on the schedule agreed at the first session. On March 7, 2012,
Claimant stated that a delay by Respondent in appointing counsel should not
affect Claimant, given that the schedule had been agreed with the understanding

that any extension of time would be justified by exceptional circumstances only.

On March 20, 2012, Respondent requested that the time limit to file its Counter-
Memorial, due on March 21, 2012, be postponed or extended on the basis of
parallel proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights, the resolution
of which might affect the present proceeding. On March 21, 2012, Claimant
requested the Tribunal to reject Respondent’s request and order it to submit its
Counter-Memorial immediately, and to consider it otherwise in default pursuant
to Rule 42 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. On March 28, 2012, the Tribunal
decided to reject Respondent’s request, and ordered Respondent to submit its
Counter-Memorial immediately. In its decision, the Tribunal (i) indicated that it
was not persuaded that the proceedings before the European Court of Human
Rights qualify as a circumstance of exceptional nature that would reasonably
justify an extension or postponement under paragraph 13.4 of Procedural Order
No. 1; (ii) noted that requesting a postponement of the ICSID proceedings was in
contradiction with the position taken by Respondent before the European Court
of Human Rights, where Respondent had raised an objection to admissibility in
favour of the ICSID proceedings; and (iii) indicated that it was not persuaded
that the proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights were
substantially similar to the ICSID proceeding, given that they relate to different
claimants, different scope of claims and different relief. Finally, the Tribunal
informed the Parties that it would have to entertain Claimant’s alternative
request that Moldova be considered in default as envisaged by ICSID Arbitration

Rule 42 should Respondent fail to do as instructed.

On March 29, 2012, Respondent informed that it expected to sign an agreement
with DLA Piper UK LLP by March 30, 2012 and that, as soon as counsel had
been retained, it would instruct them to contact the Tribunal in order to address
the procedural timetable. Respondent noted that the timetable was put in place at
a time when it had no legal representation and no experience of arbitral

proceedings pursuant to the ICSID Arbitration Rules. On March 30, 2012,

Respondent indicated that Mr. Michael Ostrove and Mr. Théobald Naud of DLA
Piper UK LLP, and Mr. Igor Odobescu of ACI Partners, had been retained as
counsel as of that day. Regarding the procedural timetable, Respondent indicated
that it expected to have jurisdictional objections, and announced that it would try

to reach an agreement with Claimant to modify the timetable.

On April 2, 2012, Claimant submitted that any jurisdictional objection by
Respondent would be time-barred under Rule 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules, and requested the Tribunal to reiterate its order for the immediate
submission by Respondent of its Counter-Memorial, and to otherwise hold
Respondent in default under ICSID Arbitration Rule 42. On the same day,
Respondent submitted a proposal to amend the schedule in accordance with
section 13(4) of Procedural Order No. 1. On April 5, 2012, the Tribunal decided
that, in light of the circumstances, an extension of time for the filing of the
Counter-Memorial was justified under section 13(4) of Procedural Order No. 1
and granted Respondent 8 weeks from the date of its decision, with the
subsequent amendment of the schedule contained in paragraph 13(2)(2) of
Procedural Order No. 1. In addition, the Tribunal considered that it was
necessary to hold a conference call with the Parties in order to discuss the

procedural timetable to follow.

On April 6, 2012, Claimant informed the Tribunal that Mr. Ion Paduraru no
longer represented Claimant as a result of his nomination as General Secretary of

the Administration of the President of Moldova.

The Tribunal held a telephone conference with the Parties on April 17, 2012.
During the conference call, the Parties discussed the schedule of submissions
following the Tribunal’s decision of April 5, 2012. On April 20, 2012, the
Tribunal confirmed the 8 week extension granted to Respondent for the
submission of its Counter-Memorial and decided to maintain the schedule set out

in sections 13(2)(3) and 13(2)(4) of Procedural Order No. 1.

On April 17, 2012, Respondent submitted a power of attorney authorizing DLA
Piper UK LLP and ACI PARTNERS to represent Moldova in the present

proceeding.

On May 31, 2012, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction,

Merits and Quantum.

On June 20, 2012, the Tribunal, after consultation with the Parties, confirmed

that the Hearing would take place in Paris from November 6 to 9, 2012.

On June 22, 2012, Claimant requested a five-week extension to file his Reply
until August 9, 2012. On June 26, 2012, Respondent indicated that even a one-
week extension at this stage would cause significant hardship for Respondent,
having organized its work around the current schedule, and requested the
Tribunal to maintain it. On June 27, 2012, the Tribunal decided to grant
Claimant a two-week extension to file his Reply, provided that the Hearing dates

were maintained.

On July 2, 2012, Respondent requested that its Rejoinder be due on October 5,
2012 in light of the Tribunal’s decision to grant Claimant a two-week extension
to file his Reply. On the same day, Claimant stated that he had no objection to
Respondent receiving additional time to file its Rejoinder, provided that
Claimant was allowed to file his Reply on August 2, 2012. On the same day,
Respondent noted that Claimant’s request that the Tribunal reconsider its
decision and grant an additional extension to Claimant was improper. On July 5,
2012, the Tribunal decided to grant Respondent’s request to submit its Rejoinder
on October 5 as well as Claimant’s request to submit his Reply on August 2,
2012. The Tribunal indicated that these extensions should give the Parties
sufficient time to organize their respective schedules without having to postpone

the Hearing dates.

On July 9, 2012, Respondent objected to the Tribunal’s revision of the
dural schedule and d that it be r idered as soon as possible. On

July 10, 2012, Claimant objected to Respondent’s letter and requested the

25.

26.

27.

Tribunal to reject Respondent’s request and maintain the schedule set forth in the
Tribunal’s letter of July 5, 2012. On July 11, 2012, the Tribunal referred to the
Parties’ requests and noted that the Tribunal had each time thoroughly
considered the Parties’ allegations on the extensions requested and granted the
extensions it considered fair and reasonable under the circumstances. The
Tribunal stated that it had reconsidered its decision in light of Respondent’s
latest request and was satisfied that there was no procedural inequality justifying
revision of its earlier decision. However, the Tribunal decided to grant
Respondent an additional two weeks until October 19, 2012 for the submission
of its Rejoinder in light of Respondent’s difficulties to reorganize its schedule.
On July 17, 2012, Claimant observed that the latest two-week extension granted
to Respondent placed Claimant in a difficult position to prepare for the Hearing,

and reserved Claimant’s right to request corrective measures if and when needed.

On July 16, 2012 Claimant requested that the Tribunal order Respondent to
produce a number of documents referred to by Respondent’s quantum expert,
Mr. Timothy Hart. On July 18, 2012, Respondent requested the Tribunal to deny
Claimant’s request on the basis that it was improperly extensive, not relevant and
material, unduly burdensome and pertaining to confidential information. On July
18, 2012, the Tribunal rejected Claimant’s request for production of documents
because it considered that it was directed towards potentially confidential
information of one of Claimant’s competitors, which was not a party to these
proceedings. In addition, the Tribunal considered the request to be unduly

burdensome.

On August 3, 2012, Claimant filed his Reply.

On September 7, 2012, Respondent requested the disclosure of certain
documents in Claimant’s possession. On September 10, 2012, the Tribunal
requested Claimant to disclose the requested documents or state the reasons for
objecting within the next seven days. On September 17, 2012, Claimant
responded producing some of the documents requested and rejecting the
disclosure of other documents on the basis that they were not relevant and

material to the outcome of the proceedings, that each party had the burden of

28.

29.

proving its own factual allegations, that the request was unduly belated or that
they were already in Respondent’s possession. On September 20, 2012, the
Tribunal (i) ordered the production, within the next seven days, of certain
documents referred to by Claimant’s quantum expert but not produced in the
arbitration, and (ii) rejected the production of other documents on the grounds
that the request was unduly burdensome and lacked sufficient relevance to the
case. On September 21, 2012, Claimant produced some documents. On
September 27, 2012, Claimant submitted the documents the production of which
had been ordered by the Tribunal.

On September 6, 2012, the Tribunal circulated a draft agenda for the Hearing
and invited the Parties to submit a joint proposal by September 27, 2012. On
September 26, 2012, the Parties requested an extension to file their joint proposal
regarding the Hearing agenda. On October 5, 2012, Claimant submitted a joint
procedural agreement, which was confirmed by Respondent on the same day.
The joint procedural agreement envisaged a first Hearing day devoted to oral
submissions, a second Hearing day for examination of experts, and a third
Hearing day for oral submissions. It was apparent in the proposal that the Parties
would only require 3 days for the Hearing. Accordingly, on October 11, 2012,
the Tribunal proposed that the Hearing dates be November 6 to 8, 2012. On
October 12, 2012, the Parties agreed with the Tribunal’s proposal that the
Hearing be held from November 6 to 8, 2012.

On October 3, 2012, Claimant submitted a second request for document
production relating to documents relied on by Respondent’s quantum expert. In
the alternative, Claimant requested that Respondent and its quantum expert be
prohibited from using data that Claimant considered to have been obtained
illegally. On October 9, 2012, Respondent requested the Tribunal to deny
Claimant’s request on the basis that the documents requested were confidential
and that the request was unduly burdensome, and to deny Claimant’s alternative
request. On October 11, 2012, the Tribunal decided to reject Claimant’s
document production request and to exclude from the record the information
contained in exhibit RQE-3 as well as any evidence based on it. The Tribunal (i)

noted that the information requested by Claimant was much broader than the

30.

31.

32.

33.

information that had been used by Respondent’s expert, and included extensive
source date from a competitor in the duty free sector, which was not a party to
the arbitration; (ii) indicated that it was not persuaded that the information
requested by Claimant was directly relevant for the quantification of Claimant’s
damages or material to the outcome of the case; and (iii) indicated that it was not
persuaded that the information relied upon by Respondent’s expert did not affect
potentially confidential information, and therefore rejected any evidence based

on this information.

On October 19, Respondent filed its Rejoinder.

On October 23, 2012, the Tribunal proposed to the Parties that the experts be
heard together at the Hearing, and that they give a brief didactic presentation of

their respective reports.

On October 30, 2012, the President held a pre-hearing telephone conference call
with the Parties on behalf of the Tribunal. During the pre-hearing conference call
the Parties confirmed their procedural agreements as contained in Claimant’s
letter of October 5, 2012, and the President of the Tribunal proposed a sequence
of examination of the experts. It was agreed that Respondent would submit the
dispositive part of the decision of the Supreme Court of Moldova dated October
17, 2012, to which Respondent refers in its Rejoinder. On the same day, the
Secretary of the Tribunal circulated the minutes of the pre-hearing conference
call in electronic format, and transmitted to the Parties the Tribunal’s request that
the Parties revert to the Tribunal on the President’s proposal for the sequence of
examination of the experts by November 5, 2012. The Tribunal also requested
the Parties to use their best efforts to locate and produce the entire decision of
the Supreme Court of Moldova dated October 17, 2012 by November 5, 2012,
and Respondent to produce the dispositive part of the decision of the Supreme

Court of Moldova dated October 17, 2012 by November 1, 2012.

On October 30, 2012, Respondent submitted the dispositive part of the decision
of the Supreme Court of Moldova dated October 17, 2012.

38.

On November 2, 2012, Claimant submitted an amended version of Exhibit C-
212 to be put on record as Exhibit C-221, and requested that all references to
Exhibit C-212 be read as references to Exhibit C-221.

The Hearing took place on November 6 through 8, 2012 at the World Bank
Conference Centre and the ICC Hearing Centre in Paris. The following
representatives of Claimant were present at the Hearing: Dr. Hamid Gharavi, Ms.
Mélanie van Leeuwen, Ms. Nada Sader, Mr. Andrian Berengoi, Mr. Franck
Charles Arif and Ms. Irina Chirilescu. The following representatives of
Respondent were present at the Hearing: Mr. Michael Ostrove, Ms. Kiera Gans,
Mr. Théobald Naud, Mr. Jonathan Chevry, Mr. Igor Odobescu, Ms. Carolina
Parcalab, Mr. Vladimir Grosu and Mr. Lilian Apostol.

Claimant’s quantum expert, Mr. John Ellison, and Respondent’s quantum expert,
Mr. Timothy Hart, were examined at the Hearing. At the beginning of Mr. Hart’s
examination, Claimant’s counsel indicated that they had only learned upon
seeing Mr. Hart at the Hearing that Claimant had previously approached Mr.
Hart when seeking to engage a quantum expert, and that eventually Claimant had
rejected Mr. Hart’s offer for his services. According to Claimant, this situation
created a conflict. After Respondent had the opportunity to reply to Claimant’s
statement, the Tribunal decided to give the Parties the opportunity to put some
questions to Mr. Hart before asking Claimant to decide whether to make a formal
application in this regard. After questioning him, Claimant decided to wave any

possible conflict with regard to Mr. Hart.

At the end of the Hearing, the Parties stated that they had no objections to the
manner in which the Hearing had been conducted. Respondent indicated that it
withdrew any objections it may have had based on the timetable and with respect

to the amounts of time that had been given to Moldova to present its case.

On November 16, 2012, the Tribunal referred to certain statements made during
the Hearing, and requested Claimant to confirm whether he had amended his
claim for relief to include restitution as an alternative to damages. If so, the

Tribunal invited Claimant to formulate this amendment in a precise manner and

39.

in writing on or before December 3, 2012. The Tribunal further invited
Respondent to make any comments it may have in relation to the issue of
restitution in light of Claimant’s statements at the Hearing, including any
consequential amendment to Respondent’s claim for relief (and in particular
paragraph 490(e) of the Rejoinder) on or before December 3, 2012. The Parties
submitted their comments on restitution on December 3, 2012. On December 4,
2012, the Tribunal requested the Parties’ comments on each other’s submissions
on restitution by December 11, 2012. The Parties submitted their comments on

December 11, 2012.

On December 3, 2012, the Parties requested an extension to submit their costs
submissions until December 14, 2012. This request was granted by the Tribunal
on December 4, 2012. The Parties submitted their costs submissions on
December 14, 2012. The Parties indicated that they had no comments on each

other’s costs submissions on December 21, 2012.

On March 15, 2013 the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that the
proceedings were declared closed as of that date in accordance with Rule 38(1)

of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND.-

The Tender.-

On February 18, 2008, the Government of Moldova issued Decision No. 172 by
which it resolved to organise and conduct a tender for the creation of a network
of duty free stores at the border with Romania (the “Tender”)'. The Ministry of

Economy and Commerce issued Announcement No. 47-48 on conducting the

dated February 18, 2008, Exhibit C-8 to Request for Arbitration.

public tender for the creation of a network of duty free stores at the border with

Romania on March 7, 2008.”

Paragraph 2.8 of the Technical Specifications of the Tender documentation

required “a proof of experience in this field of activity at least 5 years”?

ICS “Le Bridge Corporation Limited”, SRL (hereinafter “Le Bridge”), a
Moldovan company 100% owned and controlled by Claimant,’ submitted its
tender offer to the Tender Commission on April 9, 2008° and on May 20, 2008
the Chair of the Tender Commission informed Le Bridge that it had won the

Tender.

Le Bridge and the Customs Service of the Republic of Moldova formalised the
Tender results in the “Agreement on location of duty-free store network at the
state border crossing points” dated July 1, 2008 (the “July 1, 2008 Agreement”).’
Accordingly, the investor was authorised to build and manage the duty-free store
network at the following pre-established state border crossing points: Costesti-
Stinca, Cahul-Oancea, Leuseni-Albita, Sculeni, and Ungheni-Cristesti custom

station (hereinafter “Costesti”, “Cahul”, “Leuseni”, Sculeni”, and “Ungheni”).

Clause 2.1 of the July 1, 2008 Agreement provides that: “The objectives of this
Agreement consist in granting to the investor the right to create, operate and
administrate the duty-free store network at the state border crossing points
within the entire term of this Agreement, aiming at the same time at the
realization of these goals in the most appropriate, efficient, reasonable and

quick manner adaptable to the customers’ needs.”

public tender, a third party shall obtain the right to build and open duty-free

stores at the state border crossing points.”

47. Clause 7.2 further provides that: “According to the provisions of the business
plan, the parties agreed on the need to consider the possibility of granting the

IV. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND RELIEFS.-

A.

Jurisdiction.-

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial.-

a)

126

127.

Amicable Settlement

. Firstly, Respondent claims that, under Article 7 of the BIT, an investor’s right to
submit a dispute to arbitration arises only if it was impossible to reach amicable
settlement with the State within six months from the moment the dispute was
first notified. Respondent alleges that Mr. Arif has failed to abide by this
mandatory negotiation provision that conditions Respondent’s consent to

arbitrate.

The two letters sent by Claimant to Respondent on May 14, 2010, and July 12,
2011, do not meet the requirements of the six-month amicable discussions
period. Indeed, no dispute could have materialised when Mr. Arif sent his first
notice to Respondent on May 14, 2010. This letter sought to give notice to the
State of three decisions of first instance courts, the actions of which cannot be

deemed to engage the State’s responsibility and, therefore, cannot amount to

Treaty disputes. Even if this letter is considered a valid notice of a dispute, Mr.
Arif did not pursue in good faith the negotiations he started. In any case, the
majority of the claims presented by Mr. Arif to the Tribunal today are based on
decisions of the judiciary and/or conduct of the State that intervened after May
14, 2010; moreover, the nature and scope of the claims raised in that letter are

entirely different from the claims at stake in this arbitration.

Claimant’s letter of July 12, 2011 does contain a description of the dispute now
before the Tribunal. However, Claimant filed his Request for Arbitration a mere
two weeks after sending his letter of July 12, 2011, thereby depriving
Respondent of its right to address the dispute referred to by Claimant within six

months, as per Article 7 of the BIT.
Many of the claims raised are not disputes ripe for arbitration

. Respondent further notes that several of Mr. Arif’s claims relate to alleged
mistreatment by the Moldovan judiciary, therefore these claims cannot be raised
at the international level until the highest court in the State has had a chance to
act. More specifically, Mr. Arif asserts claims of complete expropriation and
breach of specific undertakings with regard to the border duty free stores, this, in
spite of the fact that the stores continue to operate, even as proceedings on the
validity of the four lease agreements between Le Bridge and the local Customs
Services are on-going. Not having exhausted local remedies in respect of the
four border stores, Claimant’s claims cannot stand, as they are yet not ripe for

arbitration.

It is an agreed principle of international law that a fundamental pre-requisite for
a claim of breach by judicial action is exhaustion of local remedies. A concern
that Le Bridge might likely lose on the merits in the local proceedings is not a
basis for filing an international claim prior to a final decision of the national
judiciary. Therefore, to the extent that Mr. Arif’s claims for the violation of the
BIT and international obligations relate to the border stores, this Tribunal does

not have jurisdiction.

135.

Nationality

Respondent alleges that, for the purposes of international jurisdiction, a
determination of a person’s nationality turns on an analysis of the law of the

State the nationality of which it is being claimed.

Claimant has not carried his burden of proving that he obtained French
nationality in conformity with French law. In other words, Claimant has not

proved that he acquired French nationality by naturalisation.

In any event Claimant shares no real and effective link with France and therefore

cannot seek protection under the BIT.

Claimant has no investment subject to Treaty protection

. Firstly, Respondent alleges that a review of every investment listed in the
Request for Arbitration shows that (i) most of these alleged rights are not
actually the subject of any claim in this proceeding, and (ii) many of these
alleged rights do not fit the BIT definition of an investment because they are not

assets of any kind under Moldovan law.

Secondly, Respondent submits that the rights claimed to have been expropriated
in Claimant’s Memorial (i.e. the right to exclusivity under the July 1, 2008
Agreement, the right to create and develop a duty free network at the border
stores under the Tender and the July 1, 2008 Agreement, and the lease of the
airport store with the Airport State Enterprise under the Lease Agreement) are
patently invalid as a matter of Moldovan law, and therefore are not capable of
founding the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. It is a well-established rule that an asset can
benefit from international protection only if it was validly acquired under local
law. In confirmation of this general principle, the BIT includes in the definition
of “investment” in Article 1(1) a condition that the investment be made in
conformity with local law. Therefore, because they are not assets and were not
invested in accordance with Moldovan law Mr. Arif’s alleged investments are

not subject to Treaty protection.

27

136. Thirdly, Respondent claims that the alleged investments belong to Le Bridge, a
Moldovan company, and not to Mr. Arif. However, the alleged rights could be
subject to Treaty protection only if they were owned by a national of the
contracting Party who invoked their protection. The assets of a company and
those of its shareholders are necessarily distinct, at least as corporate formalities
have been respected and the applicable law recognizes the separate legal
personality of these entities. It is a settled proposition in international law that
shareholders may not seek protection against injuries suffered by the companies

they own.

137. Le Bridge would have had standing in this arbitration if France and Moldova had
agreed that, for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, a legal
person having the nationality of the State party to the arbitration should be
treated as a national of the other State due to foreign control. Because no
language to this effect was included in the BIT, Le Bridge cannot bring an
ICSID arbitration against Moldova. That limitation, however, is not a basis for
granting jurisdiction over claims by Le Bridge’s shareholders, where it otherwise

does not exist.

138. Fourthly, Respondent alleges that, for the purposes of the BIT and the ICSID
Convention, Mr. Arif’s “investment” fails to qualify as such due to the absence
of any transfer of capital or technology from France to Moldova, a key objective

of the BIT.

e) The BIT contains no “specific undertakings” clause and such claims
would be inadmissible
139. Respondent submits that the Tribunal should refuse to exercise jurisdiction over
Mr. Arif’s claims for the violation of a “specific commitment”, because the BIT
contains no such obligation. Moreover, the Most Favoured Nation Clause
(“MEN clause”) included in Article 4 of the BIT cannot properly be invoked to
import such an obligation. Finally, even if such an obligation could be invoked

under the BIT, Claimant’s claim would still be inadmissible.

28

140.

141.

142.

143.

144.

Firstly, the BIT contains no “umbrella” clause. Claimant improperly reads
Articles 5 and 9 of the BIT as containing an independent international obligation

to honour specific commitments made towards Claimant.

Article 9 of the BIT permits States to offer more favourable investment
conditions in order to promote foreign direct investment in particular sectors of
the economy. It does not act as an “umbrella” clause providing a procedure to

sanction a mere contractual breach as a violation of the BIT itself.

Article 5(2) of the BIT contains a similarly narrow “specific undertakings”
provision. This “specific undertakings” clause only applies if a state party entices
a foreign national or company to invest in a regulated industry by providing

specific incentives.

Secondly, Claimant also improperly turns to the BIT’s MFN clause to import an
“umbrella” clause from either the Moldova-UK or the Moldova-USA BIT.
Claimant tries to take domestic rights that are subject to separate dispute
resolution provisions established by contract and to subject them to ICSID
arbitration. “Specific undertakings” clauses are procedural in nature, in that they
give an international remedy for a separate undertaking, rather than any
particular undertaking. MFN clauses can only import substantive obligations that
are similar in kind to the obligations that are the subject of the BIT. This
principle prohibits the expansive use of MFN clauses to bring in commitments of

any kind and subject them to BIT protection.

Thirdly, with regard to the contractual arguments made by Claimant pursuant to
the July 1, 2008 Agreement, Mr. Arif should not be permitted to bring such
claims for the breach of the specific commitments unless and until (i) Le Bridge
has exercised its right to litigate or arbitrate these alleged breaches pursuant
clause 20.10 of the July 1, 2008 Agreement and (ii) the Customs Services is
shown to have failed to abide by the award rendered by the competent arbitral
tribunal. Only under these circumstances would a claim for the violation of these

specific commitments be admissible.

Claimant’s Reply.-

145

a)

146

147.

148.

149.

. Claimant asserts that Respondent’s objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction are
inadmissible because Respondent has committed two violations of Rule 41(1) of
the ICSID Arbitration Rules. First, Respondent failed to file its objections to
jurisdiction as soon as possible after receipt of the Request for Arbitration.
Second, Respondent failed to submit its jurisdictional objections before the
expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the Counter-Memorial. While
the Tribunal may have the power to extend the time limit for the submission of
the Counter-Memorial after the expiry of the originally agreed-upon time limit,
which it did, it does not have the power to extend the deadline established by the

ICSID Rules for the submission of jurisdictional objections.
Amicable settlement

. Firstly, Claimant argues that he complied with the waiting period set forth in
Article 7 of the BIT. Mr. Arif confirms that a dispute did exist at the time the
letter of May 14, 2010 was sent. First instance court decisions can be wrongful
acts under the BIT and can crystallize into BIT disputes because, under
international law, there is no requirement to exhaust local remedies for a treaty

claim to exist, unless such claim is for denial of justice.

Secondly, ripeness cannot constitute a pre-requisite to the initiation of amicable
settlement discussions, because requiring that local remedies be exhausted before
attempting to amicably settle a dispute would deprive any investor of the

possibility of preventing a State from aggravating an already existing dispute.

Thirdly, the notice letter of May 14, 2010, which summarised the dispute, fully
complied with the “amicable settlement” requirements laid out in Article 7 of the
BIT. It is well settled that the notice of a dispute need not be detailed or

exhaustive.

Fourthly, Respondent was granted an opportunity to settle the dispute amicably

but refused to do so. Compliance with the “amicable settlement” requirement is a

30

150.

b)

151.

152.

153.

154.

mostly fact-driven question, namely whether the State was given a fair

opportunity to negotiate and failed to do so.

Claimant submits that in any case compliance with this waiting period is not a
pre-requisite to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Further, it is well settled that
compliance with a waiting period is not mandatory if there are no prospects of
reaching a settlement, or if the Parties do not show a willingness to enter into

negotiations.
The claims raised are ripe for arbitration

Claimant notes that Respondent does not raise its objection to jurisdiction on the
basis of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. Nor can it do so because the BIT
does not contain any specific obligation for the investor to exhaust local
remedies before resorting to ICSID arbitration. Claimant alleges that his claims
in relation to the border duty free stores are ripe for arbitration. It is a well settled
rule under international law that the “exhaustion of local remedies” requirement
relates to the merits of a dispute, and not to the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction or

to the admissibility of the claims.

In any case, the principle of exhaustion of local remedies does not apply to Mr.
Arif’s claim of complete expropriation of his border stores, or to his claim that
Moldova breached its specific commitments by completely depriving Claimant
of his investment in the border stores. It is a well established rule in international
arbitration that the exhaustion of local remedies does not constitute a substantive

requirement of a finding of expropriation by a court.

Assuming for the sake of argument that the exhaustion of local remedies does
constitute a pre-requisite for the finding of a breach by Moldova of its
international obligations, it is deemed to be waived if the remedies left are

obviously futile.

Claimant further submits that local remedies have in fact been exhausted in
relation to the border stores. This occurred on November 24, 2010, when the

Supreme Court irrevocably cancelled the Tender results and the July 1, 2008

31

c)

155

156.

157.

158.

Agreement formalising them, and declared that Dufremol had won the Tender.
The cancellation of the four lease agreements with the local customs offices is
thus inevitable and has already been declared by the first and second instance

courts, in their decisions.
Nationality

. Firstly, Claimant alleges that Mr. Arif has acquired French nationality in

conformity with French law.

Claimant submits that the Arbitral Tribunal does not have the power to check
whether Mr. Arif obtained French naturalization in accordance with French law
because neither the ICSID Convention, nor the BIT, nor even international law,
grant it such powers. Respondent cannot contest that Mr. Arif held French
nationality on the relevant dates for purposes of the ICSID Convention (i.e. the
date of the consent to arbitrate and the date of registration of the Request for
Arbitration). Claimant further submits that, contrary to Respondent’s allegation,
while it is a well settled principle of international law that international tribunals
have to review the validity of nationality in State to State disputes, this principle
does not apply in investor-State disputes, because preventing abusive practices

of diplomatic protection is not needed in this latter context.

There is no requirement under the ICSID Convention that nationality be granted
in accordance with the law of the State granting nationality. Nor is there such a
requirement in the BIT either. The principle applicable to the circumstances at
hand is the general principle that every State has the power to grant nationality to
individuals in accordance with its laws. France granted Mr. Arif French
nationality by Decree dated March 10, 2005.'° Therefore, Respondent’s
objection to jurisdiction on the grounds that Claimant did not prove that he

acquired French nationality in accordance with French law must be rejected.

In any case, Respondent has not discharged its burden of proof that Mr. Arif is

not a French national pursuant to French law, as it did not prove that Mr. Arif

'® See Official Journal of the French Republic, March 12, Exhibit R-17 to Respondent’s Counter-
Memorial.

32

159.

d)

acquired French nationality by fraud or as a result of a material error. In any
event, Mr. Arif satisfied the residency requirements of French law for

naturalization.

Secondly, Claimant alleges that there is no requirement of “effective nationality”
in ICSID arbitration. The only requirement in Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention is the investor not having the nationality of the host State. The text
of the BIT leaves no room for the application of the effective nationality
principle. Respondent’s argument that Mr. Arif’s French nationality must be
effective finds no support in ICSID case law. In any event, Mr. Arif has genuine

links with France.

Claimant’s investments are subject to BIT protection

160. Firstly, Claimant alleges that his investment is valid.

16

1.

In Claimant’s view, Respondent confuses the issues of the existence of an
investment with that of the validity of the same. Claimant argues the following:
(i) relying on domestic law for purposes of qualifying an “investment” within the
meaning of the BIT is not a practice under international law. Domestic law
requirements only come into play to determine whether an existing investment
within the meaning of the BIT must be protected, i.e. whether or not it was made
in violation of fundamental principles of law; (ii) Respondent’s allegation that an
“asset” within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the BIT must be determined by
reference to domestic laws is contrary to customary international law and ICSID
case law; (iii) in any event Respondent cannot contest that Claimant’s
investments, consisting of the exclusive right to create and develop a duty free
network at the border stores on a long term basis and the right to open a flagship
store at the airport on a long term basis are assets according to Moldovan law,
that they fall within the definition of “investment” contained in Article 1(1) of
the BIT, and that they are investments within the meaning of Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention. It is well settled that, pursuant to the principle of the
“general unity of an investment operation”, the definition of an investment does

not turn on the ownership of specific assets, but rather on the combination of

 

rights that are necessary for the economic activity at issue. Therefore, even if

33

each of the separate investments made by Mr. Arif were to be considered outside
the scope of Article 1(1) of the BIT (which they are not), the Tribunal would still
have jurisdiction over this dispute, as all the rights and assets comprising the

investment should be analyzed collectively, not individually.

162.

Nv

With regard to the legality of the investment, Claimant has shown that the
investments were not made in violation of Moldovan law. Assuming that the
Tribunal found a violation of local law, such violation only affects the validity of
the investment under international law if it relates to the host State’s investment
law. In any case, not any violation of the host State’s laws affects the validity of
the investment under international law. The breach must have a certain degree of
gravity and a connection to the investment. In any event, a State cannot preclude
an investor from seeking protection under the BIT when its own actions are

illegal under its own laws.

163.

oo

Further, the BIT’s definition of investment in its Article 1(1) includes indirect

  

investments. This is confirmed by a good faith reading of the BIT. The fact that
neither indirect nor direct investments are expressly mentioned in the definition
can only mean that both are included. Respondent’s interpretation of the BIT is
therefore contrary to the express wording of the definition of “investment”

contained in Article 1(1)(b).

164.

z

Finally, Claimant alleges that the origin of the capital is irrelevant to the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Indeed, there is no requirement, neither under the
ICSID Convention nor in the BIT, that there be a transfer of capital from France

to Moldova for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction.

e) Claimant’s claims on the basis of a breach by Moldova of its specific
undertakings are admissible

165. Claimant first submits that Article 9 of the BIT imposes on Moldova the
obligation to honour its specific obligations towards foreign investors. Adopting
Respondent’s interpretation of Article 9 would turn it into a tautology (a specific
commitment is regulated by its provisions) and would thus deprive Article 9 of

any real effect. A good faith interpretation of Article 9 of the BIT, pursuant to

34

166.

167.

168.

169.

170.

Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, cannot be one which leads to an absurd
result. This could not have been the Parties’ intention. The purpose of Article 9
is to include within the scope of BIT protection Moldova’s specific
commitments in favour of foreign investors, including provisions that are more

favourable to the foreign investor than those contained in the BIT.

Moldova’s obligation to honour its specific commitments is also set forth in
Article 5(2) of the BIT. In Claimant’s view, Respondent’s interpretation distorts
this Article’s clear wording, by reading into the text limitations which it does not
include, such as a limitation on its applicability to circumstances where a State
Party encourages a foreign national to invest in a regulated industry.

Respondent’s interpretation is also contradicted by the case law.

Secondly, Claimant notes that Respondent does not contest that a MFN clause
can import an “umbrella” clause in relation to the claim for breaches by Moldova
of its specific commitments contained in the Lease Agreement. Respondent only
disagrees with this possibility with regard to the commitments contained in the

July 1, 2008 Agreement and the Tender.

Claimant’s claims based on the breach by Moldova of its specific undertakings
contained in the July 1, 2008 Agreement and in the Tender are not contractual
claims, but rather Treaty claims. Mr Arif is not asking the Tribunal to decide his

claims under the July 1, 2008 Agreement for breach of contract.

It is well settled that “umbrella” clauses are substantive in nature, not procedural.
Respondent’s allegation pursuant to which MFN clauses can only import
substantive obligations that are similar in kind to the obligations that are the
subject matter of the BIT is unsupported. To the contrary, the principle that

“umbrella” clauses can be imported via an MEN clause is well accepted.

Finally, Respondent’s allegation with regard to the mandatory application of the
dispute resolution provision in the July 1, 2008 Agreement is unsubstantiated.
The forum selection clause contained in the July 1, 2008 Agreement cannot

divest the Tribunal of jurisdiction because Claimant has advanced no claims

35

under that agreement, but rather has asserted BIT breaches. Dismissing claims
raised via “umbrella” clauses on the ground that forum selection clauses exist in
contracts would be, in effect, to read an implied waiver of BIT rights into every
investment agreement that specifies a dispute resolution mechanism other than
investment arbitration. The remedies provided under the BIT and the July 1,
2008 Agreement are not mutually exclusive, but complementary. The BIT’s
dispute resolution clause is not limited in its terms to breaches of the BIT itself,
but rather extends to any disputes related to investments, which encompasses
contract disputes. The subject of the dispute resolution clause contained in the
July 1, 2008 Agreement has already been the subject of litigation in Moldova,
Respondent’s judiciary having annulled the Agreement. It would therefore be
impossible for Claimant to initiate a dispute against the Customs Services on the

basis of the July 1, 2008 Agreement.

3. Respondent’s Rejoinder.-

171.

a)

Respondent contends that its jurisdictional objections are admissible.
Respondent complied with Rule 41(1) of the Arbitration Rules. Respondent filed
its jurisdictional objections with its Counter-Memorial. Respondent in good faith
submitted its jurisdictional objections as early as possible in light of the
procedural calendar established by the Tribunal. Even if the Tribunal were to
consider that Respondent’s jurisdictional objections were filed after the deadline
for the filing of the Counter-Memorial, such a belated submission would not in

any event prevent the Tribunal from examining Respondent’s objections.

Amicable settlement

172. Respondent alleges that ripeness does constitute a pre-requisite to the initiation

173

of amicable settlement discussions, because a lack of ripeness means that there is

yet no dispute, and in the absence of a dispute there is nothing to settle.

. In relation to the letter of May 14, 2010, Respondent further alleges that Le
Bridge applied for a Security Certificate for the airport store only on February 4,

36

2010 and obtained it on June 18, 2010; therefore, no dispute could have existed

in May 2010, as Le Bridge had no right to open the airport store.

174. In addition, Respondent alleges that it never had a fair opportunity to engage in

settlement dis:

  

ssions at any time after the dispute had actually ripened.
Respondent further notes that Moldova did not ratify the ICSID Convention until
May 2011, and that, at the time of Mr. Arif’s letter in 2010, the Government
could not have imagined that any arbitral procedure would be forthcoming.
Claimant therefore cannot be excused for failing to satisfy the condition
precedent to arbitration. Moreover, Respondent alleges that Claimant’s first

attempt at settlement disci

 

ssions occurred on July 12, 2012, 17 days before the
Request for Arbitration. Nevertheless, the settlement discussion obligation is a
mandatory pre-requisite to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Finally, Respondent
submits that Claimant fails to demonstrate that any settlement discussions would

have been futile.

b) = Many of the claims raised are not ripe for arbitration

175. Respondent further argues that Mr. Arif’s claims of a judicial expropriation of
his investment in the duty free stores are not ripe for arbitration. These claims
are directed at decisions of the lower courts of Moldova. On October 17, 2012,
the Supreme Court of Justice overturned the decision of the Chisinau Court of

Appeal of December 28, 2011. The case was sent back to the lower courts for

 

further proceedings. As a result thereof, Le Bridge can continue to operate the

border stores.

c) Nationality

176. Firstly, Respondent submits that international tribunals are competent (and
indeed obliged) to make their own assessment of a claimant’s nationality when it
is challenged. In Respondent’s view, Claimant can offer no support for his
assertion that, in investor-State disputes, unlike State-to-State disputes, this
principle does not apply. Once a claimant’s nationality is challenged, it becomes
a jurisdictional fact in dispute to be decided by the tribunal. There can be no
doubt that the Tribunal is authorised to verify and must be satisfied of Mr. Arif’s

nationality before proceeding to adjudicate this dispute.

37

177

178.

d)

179

180.

. Secondly, a party bears the burden of proving its allegations. Only after that
party has actually carried this burden does it shift to the opposing party. Mr. Arif
has decided not to produce a certificate of French nationality as proof of his
nationality in the present case. A decree of naturalization in and of itself is no
proof of nationality as a matter of French law. Having failed to disclose a
certificate of nationality, it is clear that even as a matter of French law the burden
of proof still lies with Mr. Arif to establish that he is a genuine French national.
In any event, Mr. Arif has not met the requirements for acquiring French

nationality.

Thirdly, Claimant confuses dominant nationality and effective nationality. Mr.
Arif cannot benefit from protection under the Treaty because he shows no real

and effective link with France.

Claimant has no investment subject to Treaty protection

. Firstly, Claimant confuses the question of the law applicable to the qualification
of a right as an “investment” under the BIT with that of the law relevant to
identifying whether a right exists in the first instance. Claimant has not
demonstrated that all of the alleged “investments” actually exist under Moldovan
law, their existence being a matter of domestic law. One cannot rely on an
abstract principle of the unity of an investment operation to avoid demonstrating
why any alleged “right” actually exists, and in order to obtain protection for that

right.

Regarding the three core investment rights that are actually alleged to be subject
to an investment dispute (i.e. the alleged rights under the Tender, the alleged
exclusivity right under the July 1, 2008 Agreement, and the Lease Agreement on
the airport store), they were invalid pursuant to Moldovan law. The ordinary
meaning of Article 1 of the BIT, “in accordance with the legislation of the
Contracting Party”, does not limit legal compliance to specific investment
legislation. It is a fundamental governing principle of international law that
investments made in violation of the law of the host country cannot be afforded

protection.

38

181.

e)

182

183.

184.

B.

185

Secondly, the ordinary meaning of the wording of Article 1.1(b) of the BIT is
that, if an investor proves a shareholding in a company, then that shareholding is
a category of investment protected by the Treaty. The default position in
international law is that, absent a clear language to that effect, the corporate form
is recognised as legally independent from the shareholders and confers only on
the corporate entity the right to assert claims for damages suffered with regard to
its assets. Contrary to Claimant’s assertion, therefore, the absence of an express

reference to “indirect investments” is of important significance.

The BIT contains no “specific undertakings” clause and such claims
would be inadmissible

. Respondent further submits that the MFN clause in the BIT cannot, under any
circumstances, import an “umbrella” clause. This applies in relation to all claims
for breach of specific commitments made by Claimant: in relation to the Lease

Agreement, the July 1, 2008 Agreement and the Tender.

Claimant seeks to rely on the MFN clause in order to secure rights that do not
exist in the BIT, rather than to extend more favourable standards of protection
than those set out in the BIT, as intended by Article 4. This type of manipulation
of the MFN clause should be rejected.

Respondent does not allege that there is a waiver of the BIT’s dispute resolution
clause, but rather that it is premature to invoke it in support of a claim for the
breach of a specific undertaking until after the agreed forum has reviewed the
question. Claimant’s argument that the July 1, 2008 Agreement has been
annulled and that it would therefore be impossible for him to initiate a dispute
under its terms ignores the fundamental principle of the separability of

arbitration clauses.

Merits.-

. In addition to the factual and legal arguments of the Parties stated below

regarding Claimant’s claims on the merits, the Parties have also developed

39

further legal argument which has been closely analysed, and expressly addressed

by the Tribunal where appropriate in the relevant parts of the Award.

1. Claimant’s Request for Arbitration and Memorial.-

186

a)

. In his Request for Arbitration and his Memorial, Claimant alleges that
Respondent has breached its obligations under the BIT and international law
through the acts and omissions of its organs including: the judiciary, the
Customs Service, the Airport State Enterprise, the Ministry of Internal Affairs,
the NACP, the Attorney General, the Ministry of Finance (including the tax
inspection authorities), and the CCECC.

Alleged Breaches

(i) Expropriation of Claimant’s investment: Article 5 of the BIT

187

188.

189.

. Claimant submits that his investment was taken not on the basis of any alleged
wrongdoing attributable to him, but on the basis of the alleged misapplication of
Moldovan laws by the organs of the State that granted him these rights. It is a
well established principle of international law that a State cannot rely on its
internal law to invalidate its own obligations. Article 5 of the BIT expressly
provides that an expropriation by the State cannot be contrary to a specific

commitment of that State towards the investor.

The initial expropriatory act with regard to the airport store was the Economic
Circuit Court’s decision of November 10, 2009 suspending the Lease
Agreement. The Lease Agreement was subsequently cancelled by the Economic
Circuit Court on November 16, 2010. This decision was later confirmed by the
Economic Court of Appeal on February 28, 2011 and affirmed by the Supreme
Court on June 10, 2011.

With regard to the border_stores, Respondent’s expropriation of Claimant’s
exclusivity right, attributed through the Tender and recorded in the July 1, 2008
Agreement, occurred on January 1, 2011 for Leuseni, and July 8, 2011 for Cahul,

when the Customs Service authorised Dufremol to open duty free stores at these

40

(ii)

(iii)

locations. Respondent’s complete expropriation of Claimant’s investment in the
border stores took place on November 24, 2010, when the Supreme Court of
Justice irrevocably cancelled the Tender results and the July 1, 2008 Agreement.
The only reason Claimant is still able to operate his stores is based on a mere

technicality, i.e. the local lease agreements have not been finally cancelled yet.

Breach of the “specific commitments” obligation: Articles 9, 5 and 4 of the BIT

190.

191.

192.

193.

With regard to the airport store, Claimant alleges that, on June 10, 2011,
Respondent’s judiciary irrevocably cancelled the Lease Agreement entered into
by Le Bridge and the Airport State Enterprise. This was in breach of the specific
commitment which Respondent had undertaken by the signature of the Lease

Agreement on July 28, 2008.

With regard to the border stores, Claimant alleges that Respondent failed to
allocate land and/or premises that would have made the opening of a duty free
store in Ungheni possible. This was in breach of Respondent’s specific

commitments contained in the Tender and the July 1, 2008 Agreement.

Respondent’s specific commitments regarding the exclusivity right contained in
the July 1, 2008 Agreement and implied in the Tender were also breached via the
suspension of the exclusivity clause by the NACP, as well as by the Customs
Service’s decision to permit Dufremol to open border stores in Leuseni and

Cahul.

Regarding the entire investment in relation to the border stores, on November 24,
2010, Respondent’s judiciary irrevocably cancelled the Tender results and the
July 1, 2008 Agreement, in breach of the specific commitments made through

these instruments.

Breach of Fair and Equitable Treatment (“FET”): Article 3 of the BIT

194,

The long-term rights granted by State organs in relation to the airport and border
stores induced Claimant to make substantial investments. In spite of Moldova’s
specific commitments, its organs took away Claimant’s rights via multiple acts

and omissions which were in breach of Respondent’s obligation to act

41

195.

196.

197.

198.

199.

200.

consistently towards the investor. Respondent’s acts and omissions constitute a
breach of Claimant’s legitimate expectation that Moldova would honour its
specific commitments to him. Moldova’s acts and omissions are in breach of the
well-settled international law rule that a State cannot rely on its domestic laws to

breach its international obligations.

Firstly, Respondent and its organs unfairly and inequitably harassed Claimant

and his companies and attempted to intimidate him.

Secondly, with regard to the airport store, Claimant makes the following
arguments. On June 10, 2011, Respondent’s judiciary irrevocably cancelled the
Lease Agreement, thus breaching Claimant’s legitimate expectations and
Respondent’s consistency and good faith obligations. The grounds for the

cancellations were never established.

The Airport State Enterprise unfairly and inequitably seized Claimant’s goods at
the airport on December 25, 2010. Moreover, it prevented Claimant from

accessing the store until November 25, 2011.

The Attorney General failed to pursue disciplinary proceedings against Judge
Namasco, despite the express admission that there were grounds to discipline
him for his decision of November 10, 2009. This was in breach of Claimant’s

legitimate expectations and Respondent’s good faith obligations.

Thirdly, with regard to the border stores, Claimant submits the following. The
Customs Service failed to allocate land and/or premises to Claimant in order to
open a duty free store in Ungheni. This was in breach of Claimant’s legitimate
expectations and Respondent’s consistency and good faith obligations pursuant

to the Tender and the July 1, 2008 Agreement.
The fire inspection authorities unfairly and inequitably delayed the opening of

the duty free stores in Leuseni, Cahul and Sculeni for two months, alleging non-

compliance with safety regulations. This was in breach of Claimant’s legitimate

42

(iv)

201.

202.

203.

204.

expectations and Respondent’s consistency and good faith obligations as Le

Bridge had already obtained the required certifications.

The NACP unfairly and inequitably suspended the July 1, 2008 Agreement’s
exclusivity clause. This was in breach of Claimant’s legitimate expectations and
Respondent’s consistency and good faith obligations pursuant to the Tender and

the July 1, 2008 Agreement.

The customs offices of Leuseni and Cahul unfairly and inequitably entered into
lease agreements with Dufremol. This was in breach of Claimant’s legitimate
expectations and Respondent’s consistency and good faith obligations pursuant

to the Tender and the July 1, 2008 Agreement.

The customs offices of Leuseni and Cahul unfairly and inequitably attributed
better locations to Dufremol for its border stores than they did to Le Bridge. This
was in breach of Claimant’s legitimate expectations and Respondent’s

consistency and good faith obligations.

On November 24, 2010, the Supreme Court irrevocably cancelled the Tender
results and the July 1, 2008 Agreement in breach of Claimant’s legitimate

expectations and Respondent’s consistency and good faith obligations.

Arbitrary and unreasonable measures: Article 4 of the BIT

206.

Claimant further alleges that all of Moldova’s acts and omissions in breach of
the FET standard also constitute breaches of Moldova’s obligation not to impose

unreasonable/arbitrary measures.Full Protection and Security: Article 5 of

the BIT

207.

208.

Claimant alleges that Respondent is under an obligation to provide him with

FPS, pursuant to both the BIT’s Article 5 and customary international law.
Claimant further argues that all of Moldova’s acts and omissions in breach of the

FET standard also constitute breaches of Moldova’s obligation to grant full

protection and security.

43

(vi)

(vii)

Discriminatory measures: Article 4 of the BIT

209.

210.

211.

212.

Respondent’s obligation not to discriminate is set forth in Article 4. Moreover,
Article 4 is an MFN clause that imports the obligation not to impose

discriminatory measures from the UK-Moldova BIT and the USA-Moldova BIT.

All of Moldova’s acts and omissions in breach of FET also constitute breaches

of Moldova’s obligation not to impose discriminatory measures.

In particular, Respondent cancelled Le Bridge’s Lease Agreement on the pretext
that it had not been obtained via a tender, despite the fact that Respondent
authorised Dufremol to lease premises at the airport without such a tender.
Respondent granted Le Bridge the exclusive right to operate border duty free
stores after winning a tender and then authorised Dufremol to open stores at

Leuseni and Cahul without a tender.

The national Customs Service and the customs offices of Leuseni and Cahul
discriminated in favour of Dufremol by attributing better locations to Dufremol
for its border stores in Cahul and Leuseni, by preventing customers from
shopping at Le Bridge, and erecting a fence in front of Le Bridge’s store in

Leuseni.

Denial of Justice

213.

As an alternative claim to the claims presented in detail above, Claimant submits
that Respondent’s judiciary, through its acts and omissions, breached Moldova’s
obligation not to deny justice. In this respect Claimant refers to two sets of
decisions. The first concerns the airport store, and was rendered at the request of
Dufremol and other companies that it owns and/or is connected to. These
decisions resulted in the cancellation of the Lease Agreement on the grounds that
the Airport State Enterprise had unlawfully attributed the premises to Le Bridge
and that the Lease Agreement had not been preliminarily approved by the
SACA. A second set of decisions concerns the border stores and was also
rendered at the request of Dufremol. These decisions resulted in the cancellation

of the Tender results and the July 1, 2008 Agreement on the grounds that the

44

Tender Commission had unlawfully awarded the Tender to Le Bridge, despite it
not having the requisite commercial experience.
(a) Procedural denial of justice

(i) Collusion

214. Claimant argues that there was collusion between the local parties in interest (i.e.

Le Bridge’s local competitors in the duty free business: Dufremol, Moldclas

 

ica,
Trivoli-Com and Ghermivali), and Moldova’s judiciary, as well as a close
coordination between the different instances within Moldova’s judiciary. The
ultimate goal of these actors’ conduct was to permanently prevent the opening of

Claimant’s airport duty free store.

215. Claimant asserts procedural denial of justice. He alleges that the Economic
Circuit Court, the Economic Court of Appeal and Le Bridge’s interconnected
competitors that brought an action have acted in collusion to prevent the
execution of the valid Lease Agreement and the opening of the airport shop. This
was done by ordering provisional measures without any legal basis in the
Moldovan Civil Procedure Code. The different applications for interim measures
were made in connection with an action by Le Bridge’s competitors for the

invalidation of the Lease Agreement.

(ii) Lack of jurisdiction

216. In its decision of May 28, 2010, the Economic Circuit Court ruled that it had
jurisdiction over Dufremol’s claim to cancel the Tender results and the July 1,
2008 Agreement. However, in Claimant’s view, the court patently did not have
such jurisdiction given the administrative nature of the contested acts. Moreover,
the Economic Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Justice failed to
exercise their duty to verify the procedural and material legality of the decisions

rendered by the lower instances.

(iii) Failure to abide by the mandatory preliminary application procedure

217. Claimant argues that on May 28, 2010, the Economic Circuit Court ruled in

favour of Dufremol without taking into consideration that it had not complied

45

with the mandatory preliminary application procedure that is a pre-condition for
initiating legal proceedings to challenge administrative acts. In the same
proceedings, Dufremol also produced a false preliminary application that it had
purportedly filed with the Ministry of Economy on December 5, 2009. Claimant
further notes that the Economic Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of
Justice should have remedied these defects of the Economic Circuit Court’s
decision on their own motion, by quashing it. Instead, Claimant argues, the
Supreme Court of Justice unlawfully shifted the burden of proof on Le Bridge,
holding that it should have demonstrated that Dufremol had not complied with

the preliminary application procedure.

de

(iv) Failure to abide by the y limitation period

218. On May 28, 2010, the Economic Circuit Court ruled in favour of Dufremol
disregarding that it had failed to institute legal proceedings within the statutory
30-day limitation period applicable to actions seeking the cancellation of
administrative acts. The Economic Court of Appeal also disregarded the expiry
of the applicable limitation period, while the Supreme Court of Justice failed to
justify why Dufremol would not be barred from instituting legal action after the

limitation period had lapsed.

(v) Violations of due process

219. During the hearing of May 28, 2010, the Economic Circuit Court admitted
irregular changes to Dufremol’s claim (which was orally amended), while
simultaneously refusing to afford the defendant (i.e. Le Bridge) any opportunity
to present its case in respect of such amended claim. In Claimant’s view, the
Economic Court of Appeal ignored these procedural irregularities, and the
Supreme Court of Justice refused to admit Le Bridge’s appeal on cassation,
while overstepping its authority and examining the substance of the matter in

detail.
(b) Substantive denial of justice

220. Claimant argues that Moldova’s judiciary, on several occasions and in relation to

both the airport and the border store proceedings, misapplied the law so

46

blatantly, arbitrarily and unjustly that the resulting decisions also qualify as a

substantive denial of justice.

(i) Cancellation of the Lease Agreement

221. On November 16, 2010, the Economic Circuit Court cancelled the Lease
Agreement on the grounds that the premises allotted to Le Bridge should have
been granted through a tender and that the Lease Agreement had not been
preliminarily approved by the SACA. The Economic Court of Appeal affirmed
this decision on February 28, 2011, as did the Supreme Court of Justice on June
10, 2011, both courts thereby failing to correct the grave misapplications of the

law.

(ii) Cancellation of the Tender results and of the July 1, 2008 Agreement

222. On May 28, 2010, the Economic Circuit Court cancelled the Tender results and
the July 1, 2008 Agreement on the grounds that Le Bridge did not have the
requisite experience in the field of duty free to have won the Tender, thus
reformulating the original Tender requirements. The Economic Court of Appeal,
on September 7, 2010, and the Supreme Court of Justice, on November 24, 2010,
both confirmed the Economic Circuit Court’s decision, equally ignoring the clear

and unambiguous language of the Tender.

(iii) Ultra petita decisions

223. On May 28, 2010, the Economic Circuit Court ordered the national Customs
Service to withdraw its acceptance of the lease agreements entered into by the
local customs offices and Le Bridge, despite the fact that Dufremol had never
requested such relief. On September 7, 2010, the Economic Court of Appeal
ruled that Dufremol was the winner of the Tender, again despite the fact that
Dufremol had never requested such relief. The Supreme Court of Justice failed

to address and remedy these violations in its decision of November 24, 2010.
(viii) Compensation

224. In the further alternative, Claimant notes that, even assuming that the acts and

omissions of Respondent and its organs were not committed in breach of the BIT

47

and international law, and further assuming that the decisions of the judiciary do
not constitute a denial of justice, it remains undisputed that a taking of his
investment in the duty free sector took place. For this he is owed compensation.
Respondent’s compliance with international law requirements in relation to
expropriation would only make the taking lawful, but would still leave Claimant

uncompensated, in breach of the BIT and international law.

2. Respondent’s Counter-Memorial.-
a) Alleged Breaches
(i) Expropriation of Claimant’s investment: Article 5 of the BIT
225. Even if the Tribunal were inclined to define “investment” in a broader way than
Respondent submits is possible under the Treaty, and thus to find that it has

jurisdiction to hear this dispute, the expropriation claim nevertheless fails on the

merits.

226.

a

Firstly, the specific wording of Article 5 of the BIT limits expropriation claims
to losses of directly-owned investments. Only Le Bridge had a possessory
interest in the rights at issue and thus only Le Bridge would be protected against

being dispossessed of that interest.

227.

xa

Secondly, the application of existing law of general application to rights arising
in areas concerning the lease of State property, the organisation of State tenders
and regulation of competition is classically understood to be at the core of a
State’s police power. The application of such laws leading to the loss of property
is consistently understood to amount to a non-compensable regulatory measure
and not a compensable taking. In most cases, these regulatory measures were
applied not as a result of any interference by the State, but rather as a result of
the actions of private competitors who disliked the fact that Le Bridge had
obtained all of its rights unlawfully. All of Mr. Arif’s alleged “deprivations” in
fact result from the application of the generally applicable regulatory power of

Moldova.

48

(ii)

228. The fundamental flaw in Claimant’s position with regard to the airport duty free

store and the alleged exclusivity right pursuant to the Tender and the July 1
2008 Agreement, is that he seeks to be excused from complying with local
legislation regarding his investment. If the law applicable to a property right
properly calls for the annulment of that right, then the mere effect of that existing
law cannot be expropriatory because the investor has no legitimate right to

protect.

229. With regard to the exclusivity right, the application of existing rules regulating

competition, which were in force at the time an investor made his investment,

cannot support a claim for expropriation under international law.

230. With regard to the border stores, the Supreme Court’s decision of November 24,

2010 cancelled the results of the Tender and the July 1, 2008 Agreement because
of violations of mandatory tender requirements, but that decision did not cancel
the individual leases for the border stores. Le Bridge continues to operate the
border duty free stores in Moldova and to derive substantial revenue from them.
Moreover, Mr. Arif has not lost his title in his shares of Le Bridge and Le Bridge
maintains an active profitable duty free business, such that Mr. Arif has not been
deprived of the use and benefit of his investment. Under these circumstances, it

is not possible to find an expropriation under international law.

Breach of the “specific commitments” obligation: Articles 9, 5 and 4 of the BIT

231.

232.

233.

Respondent cannot have violated a “specific undertakings” obligation under the
Treaty because the Treaty neither contains nor imports any such obligation. In

any event Respondent did not breach any commitments to Claimant.

With regard to the Lease Agreement, the essence of Claimant’s argument is that
rights created by a contractual “undertaking” were taken by judicial action. The
claim as stated is indistinguishable from the expropriation claim and the Tribunal

is referred to Respondent’s analysis with regard to expropriation.

With regard to the July 1, 2008 Agreement, all of the undertakings included in it

are subject to Moldovan law. However, the entire Agreement is a nullity under

49

Moldovan law because (i) the exclusivity clause was in flagrant violation of
Moldovan law and (ii) the exclusivity clause being a sine qua non for the entry
into the Agreement, the nullity of that clause leads to the nullity of the entire
agreement. Because the July 1, 2008 Agreement is a nullity under Moldovan

law, Respondent cannot have breached any of its provisions.

234. In relation to the alleged exclusivity rights, the NACP’s review of the July 1,
2008 Agreement to see if it complies with mandatory legislation cannot possibly
amount to a breach of that same contract merely because another State entity was
a party. The NACP simply performed its regulatory function. Respondent never
made any undertaking to Claimant that he or Le Bridge would be exempt from

Moldovan competition law.

235. Claimant has argued that Respondent breached its specific commitments when
the Supreme Court decided on November 24, 2010, to cancel the Tender results
and the July 1, 2008 Agreement. Respondent replies that a court’s review of the
legality of a Tender or a contract and its subsequent decision to annul them
cannot possibly amount to a breach of the Tender or contract obligations merely

because the State was a party.

236. Even if the July 1, 2008 Agreement were valid, it is patently false to allege that
the Customs Service did not allocate appropriate premises to Le Bridge for the

duty free store in Ungheni.
(iii) Breach of FET: Article 3 of the BIT

237. With respect to FET, Respondent contends that Claimant could not legitimately
expect that he could acquire rights in violation of local law or that the local
authorities and courts would not apply it. It is incontrovertible that, pursuant to
the Treaty, investors must make their investments in compliance with local
legislation. Absent any specific and explicit State assurance that the investor was
for some proper reason exempt from these generally applicable provisions, the
investor cannot make out a violation of international law merely because he

found himself properly subjected to the domestic law governing his actions.

50

238.

239.

240.

241.

242.

243.

In particular, with regard to the airport store, the Lease Agreement was signed in
contravention of the applicable laws on the lease of state property; therefore, no
legitimate expectations could be derived from it. It was entirely illegitimate to
consider that Le Bridge could negotiate directly with the airport based on the
Tender because the Tender simply did not relate to the airport. The tender offer
created no legitimate expectation of obtaining the Lease Agreement. Legitimate
expectations must be based on explicit representations by the authorities that are

competent to make those statements as an inducement to invest.

Regarding the seizure of the goods at the airport store, because the duty free
premises are in a restricted zone of the airport, the authorities could not permit
Le Bridge to access the area when the lease was suspended by a court order. Le

Bridge ultimately recovered its goods once the litigation was finished.

Regarding the disciplinary proceedings against Judge Namasco, this matter could
not affect an investment and did not relate to the decision to invest. Therefore,

Respondent could not have breached any Treaty obligation in this respect.

With regard to the border stores, Respondent makes the following arguments. In
relation to Ungheni, Respondent claims that the Customs Service did in fact
offer the exact the location that Claimant had expected to have since the Tender

began.

A contractual commitment is not the type of specific assurance that can create
legitimate expectations for an investor. The insertion into a State contract does
not, without more, provide the type of specific representation to promote

investments that can found a FET claim.

Neither Mr. Arif, nor Le Bridge had any legitimate expectation that Le Bridge
would not be required to make changes in order for the stores to comply with fire
safety regulations. Mr. Arif’s claim that the fire inspection authorities acted
improperly is inconsistent with the facts. Investors have a due diligence

obligation; they must be aware of and comply with local regulations. The

Sl

244.

245.

246.

247.

248.

application of such regulations in the interest of public safety cannot amount to a

violation of the FET standard or of any other international law obligation.

The fact that Le Bridge was allowed to open additional duty free stores at other
border crossing points is evidence that it and Mr. Arif were treated fairly and

equitably.

Regarding the NACP, Claimant provides no analysis of how he could possibly
have legitimately expected that he would be exempt from mandatory Moldovan
law protecting consumers from anti-competitive measures. There was never any
promise of exclusivity in the Tender. And with respect to the July 1, 2008
Agreement, the insertion of a right into a State contract does not, without more,
provide the type of specific representation to promote investments that can found

a FET claim.

Regarding the alleged better locations granted to Dufremol, the State never
promised that competitors would not receive more favourable positions at the
border crossings. Even if he had any basis for such a legitimate expectation, Mr.
Arif fails to demonstrate that the Customs Services in fact gave better locations

to Dufremol or did so for improper motives.

In relation to the cancellation of the Tender by the Supreme Court on November
24, 2010, the Supreme Court accurately described the legal requirements of the

Tender and the illegality of the Tender award.

With regard to the alleged harassment of Claimant due to the tax investigation,
Respondent alleges that it commenced an investigation for tax violations by Mr.
Arif and Le Bridge because it had very serious concerns that Le Bridge was
illegally selling cigarettes and using its duty free business as a cover to avoid tax
payments. The CCECC raid that Mr. Arif considers harassment was carried out

pursuant to a warrant in furtherance of this investigation.

52

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

Arbitrary and unreasonable measures: Article 4 of the BIT

249. The Treaty does not contain an express obligation not to impose unreasonable or
arbitrary measures. Accepting Claimant’s logic that this standard is applicable
via the MFN clause and that it does not differ from the FET standard, (i)
unreasonable and arbitrary measures protections are the same as FET
protections, (ii) unreasonable and arbitrary measures protections are therefore by
definition not more favourable than the protections already afforded in the treaty,
and (iii) such protections therefore cannot be imported as an independent treaty
standard via the MFN clause in Article 4, which requires application of other

provisions only if they are more favourable.

250. Claimant’s arguments in favour of a violation of this obligation are

indistinguishable from his arguments with respect to FET.
Full Protection and Security: Article 5 of the BIT

251. The text and context of Article 5(1) clearly indicate that the FPS obligation is to
be understood in the classic sense of offering a level of due diligence on the part

of the State to ensure the physical safety and integrity of protected investments.

252. In any case, because Claimant relies entirely on an alleged violation of FET to
establish a breach of FPS, Respondent’s defences to the former are a full defence
to the latter. Respondent reserves its right to address this issue further if

Claimant seeks to present an independent basis for this claim.
Discriminatory measures: Article 4 of the BIT

253. To the extent that Claimant seeks to import a “no discriminatory measures”
obligation from other Moldovan BITs via the MFN clause in Article 4, his claim
for the breach of that obligation should be dismissed for the same reasons as

those pertaining to the claim over arbitrary and unreasonable measures.

254. In the alternative, Claimant appears to equate the national treatment standard in

Article 4 with a no discriminatory measure standard and to argue that

53

Respondent has breached Article 4. Respondent alleges that there was no

discrimination on the facts for the reasons stated below.

255. With regard to the annulment of the Lease Agreement, the courts did not decide
that Le Bridge’s lease was invalid because no tender was held, but because the
SACA had not given its prior approval either to a direct lease arrangement, after
considering whether a tender should or should not be held, or to the terms of the
Agreement itself. Mr. Arif cannot prove discrimination unless he can show that
other lessees have been treated more favourably than Le Bridge under the same
legal framework; or that the other airport tenant’s leases were challenged in court

and not cancelled.

256. With regard to Dufremol’s authorization to open border duty free stores, nothing
in the Moldovan Customs Code requires the holding of a tender to grant a license
to operate a duty free store. Moreover, the tender process held in 2008 nowhere
indicated that the winner would have exclusive rights to operate border duty free

stores.

257. With regard to Dufremol’s and Le Bridge’s respective locations at Leuseni and
Cahul, it was Le Bridge who selected its locations in both cases. The fence in
front of Le Bridge’s store in Leuseni was a legitimate measure meant to prevent
admittedly illegal duty free shopping from occurring at Le Bridge’s premises.
And with regard to Claimant’s argument that customers were prevented from
shopping at Cahul, Respondent alleges that this incident is trivial and that a
single incident in October 2011 can hardly show a pattern of discriminatory

treatment by the Cahul Customs Service against Le Bridge.
(vii) Denial of Justice

258. With respect to denial of justice, Respondent first notes that it refers to the
treatment of litigants, not to the treatment of investments. Mr. Arif was not a
party to any litigation in Moldovan courts and therefore he cannot demonstrate

that Respondent administered justice to him in a fundamentally unfair way.

54

259.

Secondly, there is no evidence of corruption. In the absence of any proof of
corruption or collusion with regard to any decision taken after November 2009
and thus in particular with respect to any decision of the Supreme Court of
Justice, Respondent requests that these allegations be withdrawn by Mr. Arif and

if not withdrawn, rejected by the Tribunal.

(a) No substantive denial of justice

260.

261.

262.

An international tribunal hearing a claim of substantive denial of justice is not
authorised to act as an ultimate appellate court, reviewing decisions of domestic
supreme courts for correctness. The only way a State judiciary’s substantive
decisions can amount to a violation of international legal standards is if they
reach such a level of arbitrariness and egregiousness that they could not possibly

have been rendered in good faith.

The decisions rendered by the Moldovan Supreme Court in relation to the
invalidity of the Lease Agreement and the Tender award are correct as a matter
of substance. With regard to the Lease Agreement, at the time it was concluded
there was no prior approval by the SACA (which chooses the lessee) and no
authorization by the SACA to conclude the contract without prior tender (i.e. by
direct negotiation), although this was required by law. With regard to the Tender,
Respondent alleges that it was awarded to Claimant in breach of the requirement

of experience of at least five years in the duty free sector.

Claimant’s allegation that the courts rendered ultra petita decisions by granting
relief not requested by Dufremol — obliging the Customs Services to withdraw
their consent to the border lease agreements and declaring Dufremol the winner
of the Tender — does not withstand scrutiny. In neither of these cases did the
Moldovan judiciary order relief that was anything more than the obvious
consequence of the courts’ legal findings based on the plaintiff's submission. In
any case, Claimant has not even alleged that the ultra petita rulings themselves
caused any prejudice relevant to this case. Even if they were considered ultra
petita, the analysis by which the lower courts arrived at their decisions and the
Supreme Court affirmed them is by no means so arbitrary or egregious to allow a

finding of a substantive denial of justice.

55

(b) No procedural denial of justice

263.

264.

z

265.

a

266.

With regard to the allegation of collusion, there is no evidence that the Moldovan
judiciary colluded in any way with Le Bridge’s competitors. The primary
decisions regarding which Mr. Arif alleges collusion (the Economic Circuit
Court’s decisions ordering provisional measures at the airport) were consistently
overturned by the Economic Court of Appeal in favour of Le Bridge. Given that
only final decisions of the judiciary can be the basis for the international
responsibility of a State, it follows that the decisions of the Economic Circuit
Court do not engage the international responsibility of Moldova. Mr. Arif’s
allegation regarding the provisional measures issued by the Court of Appeal is

presented in incredibly misleading terms.

With regard to the lack of jurisdiction, Respondent notes that the boundaries
between the civil and the administrative law courts are often blurred on issues of
jurisdiction in cases involving conflicting private interests and the grant by state
entities of leases and other typical private law instruments. The question of
jurisdiction was not so simple that the mistake could be explained only by

arbitrariness and egregious bad faith.

With regard to the mandatory preliminary application procedure even though
Dufremol was not able to produce the proof of registration of the application
with the Ministry of Justice, it did provide proof of its preliminary application
letter, which was accepted by the courts. And, with regard to the 30-day
limitation period, the Supreme Court relieved Dufremol of this procedural bar
after devoting an extensive analysis to the question and finding that Dufremol
could not have had access to Le Bridge's Tender application, and thus to the
necessary facts, within the statutory limit. Both issues were therefore thoroughly
and thoughtfully debated by the courts. In any case, the analysis of the courts
was not so arbitrary or egregiously wrong that the good faith of the Moldovan

Supreme Court can be put into question.

The allegation of a due process violation following the admission of an irregular

oral amendment to Dufremol’s claim during the hearing on the merits of May 28,

56

2010, is unfounded. Indeed, the amendment was in fact properly made and Le

Bridge was provided with an opportunity to respond.

(viii) Compensation

267. Claimant’s alleged investment was not expropriated so no compensation is due.

b)

Reparation

268. Respondent cannot be required to make reparations unless Claimant has

269.

270.

27

established a causal link between the alleged wrongful act and the alleged loss.
No acts attributable to Respondent could have caused any loss to Claimant, even
if those acts are determined to be internationally wrongful, because the rights
that Claimant allegedly acquired were in fact unlawful by reason of conduct

attributable to Claimant himself and Le Bridge.

Restitution is the primary form of reparation for an internationally wrongful act.
Although Claimant does not seek restitution, Respondent reserves the right to
request that restitution be the relief ordered, if any, to the extent it is possible and
lawful under the circumstances and in light of the particular obligation the

Tribunal may determine that Respondent has breached.

In the event that the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction and that there has been
a denial of justice, but it also finds that Mr. Arif’s alleged investments were
invalid under Moldovan law, and therefore not subject to substantive protection,
then Mr. Arif would be entitled to satisfaction in the form of a simple declaration
of the wrongfulness of the State’s actions. He would not be entitled to restitution

or compensation.

. Should the Tribunal determine that damages are warranted, Respondent submits
that the amount of compensation Claimant requests is grossly inflated.

Moreover, Claimant is not entitled to moral damages.

Claimant’s Reply.-

a)

Alleged Breaches

Expropriation: Article 5 of the BIT

272

273.

274.

275.

. Inhis Reply, Claimant further makes the following submissions. Claimant’s case
of expropriation is not about “expropriation by denial of justice”. Claimant does
not need to show that he was denied justice for his claim of expropriation to
prevail. It suffices, for a finding of unlawful expropriation, that the State has
deprived Claimant of his investment (i) without a public purpose, and/or (ii) in a
discriminatory manner; and/or (iii) contrary to a specific commitment; there is
no need to show that Respondent denied justice to Claimant. This is a case of a
taking by a State organ, namely the judiciary, whose acts can constitute an

expropriation under international law.

Respondent contends that Mr. Arif never “possessed” the rights that have
allegedly been expropriated and therefore cannot be deprived of any investment.
Claimant replies that Article 5 of the BIT protects investments indirectly owned
by investors. Had the Parties intended to limit the protection against
expropriation to investments directly belonging to an investor, they easily could
have done so expressly. The fact that the BIT does not differentiate between

direct or indirect investments can only mean that both are included.

Respondent alleges that Mr. Arif’s deprivation of his investments resulted from
the application of the regulatory power of Moldova. Respondent does not allege,
let alone prove, that its acts and omissions that led to the loss of Claimant’s
investment were aimed at the general welfare, or were required to protect the
population. It is well settled that the exercise by the State of its “police powers”
cannot excuse the State from complying with its specific commitments. In any
event, in order not to entail compensation, a regulatory measure should be
exercised legitimately, i.e. in a non-discriminatory manner, in good faith and for

the sake of general welfare.

With regard to the Lease Agreement and the exclusivity right, Claimant alleges

that, assuming for the sake of argument that they were invalid pursuant to

58

276.

Moldovan law, Moldova is estopped from invoking their invalidity because it
was Moldova itself that granted him these rights. Moreover, under international

law, a State cannot rely on its internal law to invalidate its own obligations.

Claimant further alleges that, by irrevocably cancelling the Tender results and
the July 1, 2008 Agreement, Respondent took away his right to operate the duty
free stores at the borders -the very basis of his investment. Although he still
operates these stores on the basis of a mere technicality in order to mitigate his

damages Claimant’s investment has lost its value.

(ii) Breach of the “specific commitments” obligation: Article 9, 5 and 4 of the BIT

277.

278.

279.

Claimant makes several additional submissions. With regard to the airport duty
free store, all of Respondent’s defences in relation to expropriation which fail,
for the reasons set forth regarding expropriation, are also misplaced in relation to
Respondent’s breach of its specific commitments. Irrespective of whether the
Tribunal finds that Claimant’s investment was expropriated, be it unlawfully or
lawfully, the Tribunal can find that Respondent breached its specific
undertakings towards Claimant, and award Claimant compensation for this

reason alone.

With regard to the border stores, the July 1, 2008 Agreement is valid pursuant to
Moldovan law, irrespective of the validity of the exclusivity provision. In any
event, the exclusivity clause is valid. Irrespective of the validity and/or legality
of the July 1, 2008 Agreement, the deprivation by Respondent still violates its

specific undertaking.

Respondent’s argument with regard to Ungheni fails on the facts. Moreover,
whether the NACP acted within the scope of its competence when it considered
the validity of the exclusivity clause, or whether the NACP’s decision was legal
is irrelevant for a finding that Respondent breached its specific commitments. In

any event, the NACP’s decision was illegal.

59

(iii)

Breach of FET: Article 3 of the BIT

280.

281.

282.

283.

284.

Claimant submits that Respondent does not dispute that it breached its good faith
obligations by ignoring its specific commitments. Even if the Tribunal found that
Respondent did not breach Claimant’s legitimate expectations, it would still have
to find that Respondent breached the FET standard as it has breached its

obligations of good faith and consistency.

Claimant argues that the invalidity of rights under municipal law, if they created
expectations to the investor, cannot be invoked against him to allege that those
expectations were not legitimate. Claimant does not allege a breach of his
legitimate expectations because Respondent failed to perform a contractual
agreement, but because the State declared that agreement invalid after having
agreed to it. The State cannot assert the invalidity of a contract which it drafted

and concluded.

With regard to the airport store, Mr. Arif was certain that Moldova fully
approved and supported his investment. The legality of the Lease Agreement is
irrelevant for purposes of Mr. Arif’s legitimate expectations. There is no reason
why Le Bridge could have reasonably known that, by putting its goods at the
airport, it would never be able to have access to them before they became

outdated and/or expired.

Claimant’s legitimate expectation that he would finally be allowed to open his
flagship store at the airport arises out of the express admission of the Attorney
General that there were grounds to discipline Judge Namasco for his decision of
November 10, 2009, which prevented Mr. Arif from opening the store. Claimant
was left hanging in limbo and was eventually told that the disciplinary

proceedings had been terminated, without any further explanation.
With regard to the border stores, Claimant further alleges the following. In

relation to Ungheni, the Customs Service did not offer to Le Bridge the location

that Claimant expected to have since the Tender began. Le Bridge’s legitimate

60

285.

286.

287.

288.

289.

expectation to open a duty free store in Ungheni arose out of both the Tender,

and the July 1, 2008 Agreement.

The fire inspection authorities interfered just before the opening of Claimant’s
stores, despite Claimant’s legitimate expectation to be able to open his stores

after having received all necessary certificates.

Regarding the intervention of the NACP, Claimant’s legitimate expectations for
exclusivity do not arise out of purely contractual rights. They arise out of the fact
that different organs of Moldova promised him exclusivity. Claimant is not
claiming a breach by Moldova of the July 1, 2008 Agreement but a breach of
international law. Claimant legitimately expected that the State would act with
consistency and transparency, and that his exclusivity right, granted by various
organs of Moldova, would not be taken away by other organs, namely the NACP

and subsequently the local Customs Services.

Regarding the locations granted to Dufremol in Leuseni and Cahul, Claimant
legitimately expected to be granted exclusivity on the border crossings. Claimant
also legitimately expected that the State would act in good faith towards his

investment and himself.

Regarding the cancellation of the Tender and the July 1, 2008 Agreement by the
Supreme Court’s decision of November 24, 2010, the judiciary, an organ of the
State, took away from Claimant what other organs had granted him and what he
believed in good faith to be valid. Irrespective of the correctness of the court’s
decision, it has resulted in a breach of Claimant’s legitimate expectations.
Indeed, Claimant legitimately expected to be treated with consistency by the

State, and that the State would act in good faith in relation to his investment.

With regard to Claimant’s harassment, Claimant did also have legitimate
expectations that the State would act in good faith in relation to his investment.
He could not have legitimately expected that he would be subject to tax evasion

allegations without any justification, having been one of the most reliable

61

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

Moldovan taxpayers over the years, and without allegations of wrongdoing

having ever been raised against him.
Arbitrary and unreasonable measures: Article 4 of the BIT

290. Claimant maintains by way of precaution that he is entitled to be protected
against such measures pursuant to the MFN clause of the BIT, in case the

Tribunal should find that the standard differs from that of the FET standard.
Full Protection and Security: Article 5 of the BIT

291. Claimant further argues that a treatment that is unfair and inequitable
automatically entails the absence of full protection and security, and that the FPS

standard is related to the FET standard of the BIT.

292. If the Parties had intended to limit the State’s obligation of FPS to physical
interferences, they would have expressly stated so in the BIT, but they did not.
Consistent ICSID case law confirms that the FPS standard encompasses the legal

security in which an investment operates.
Discriminatory measures: Article 4 of the BIT

293. Claimant had an exclusive right to operate duty free stores at the Romanian
borders. This right arose from both the Tender and the July 1, 2008 Agreement.
Indeed, the July 1, 2008 Agreement specifically indicated that the only way a
competitor would be able to open a duty free store at the border crossings was by
winning a public tender organized to this effect after the expiry of the
Agreement. This notwithstanding, Dufremol was granted the right to open duty
free stores at Leuseni and Cahul via a directly negotiated lease contract and

before the expiry of the July 1, 2008 Agreement.
294. Mr. Arif points out that Respondent does not dispute that Article 4 of the BIT

encompasses protection against discriminatory measures. Claimant adds that this

protection also stems from the MFN clause of the BIT.

Denial of Justice

Claimant further alleges in his Reply that, if a judicial system is unable,
incapable or unwilling to correct the actions of individual judges who patently
disregarded fundamental procedural rules, then the State which is responsible for
the administration of justice cannot be excused from the international delict that
stems from that failure of the judiciary. The State therefore has full responsibility

for the damage that the foreigner suffered as a result of the judiciary’s delict.

Mr. Arif has not made any specific claims of corruption against the Moldovan
judiciary, other than noting the content of reports published by international

organizations.

Denial of justice is a breach of FET. As such, there is no need for Mr. Arif to
have been denied justice personally, as alleged by Respondent. Rather, it is
sufficient for a denial of justice to have taken place which deprived Mr. Arif of
his investment; this in turn, constitutes a breach by Moldova of its obligations to
accord FET to Claimant’s investments. Given that the BIT protects indirect
investments, it is undisputable that Mr. Arif in his capacity as an indirect
investor, has standing before this Tribunal to bring a claim against Moldova for

breaches of its obligations under the BIT and international law.

Claimant reiterates his position that he was the victim of both a procedural and a
substantive denial of justice. With regard to the latter Moldova egregiously
misapplied the law by unlawfully cancelling the Lease Agreement, the Tender

results and the July 1, 2008 Agreement.

Claimant alleges that the Airport State Enterprise sent to the SACA for approval
the Airport Lease Agreement, which is virtually identical to the sample lease
agreement contained in Regulation No. 483. The Airport Lease Agreement itself
makes clear, at Articles 3.1 and 8.1, that it is effective only once it has been
approved by the SACA. The lessee selection procedure, i.e. direct negotiations
as opposed to a tender, is also implicitly indicated in the Airport Lease
Agreement, as there is no reference to a tender, but rather a preamble stating that

the Airport State Enterprise and Le Bridge “have concluded the following

63

300.

Ss

Agreement.” On August 5, 2008, the SACA approved the Airport Lease
Agreement including, implicitly, the lessee selection procedure, and returned it
to the Airport State Enterprise. The Board of Directors of the Airport State
Enterprise then officially endorsed the Airport Lease Agreement by way of
Minutes No. 9, dated August 13, 2008.

With regard to the Tender, Claimant reiterates that the Moldovan courts
dishonestly reformulated one technical specification in the Tender documents, by
requiring 5 years of experience in the duty free sector rather than in commercial

activity in general.

(viii) Compensation

301.

b)

302

303.

304.

Respondent’s non-payment of compensation for the expropriation of Claimant’s
investment constitutes a further breach of its obligations under the BIT and

international law.
Reparation

. With regard to causation, neither Le Bridge’s successful participation in the
Tender nor the July 1, 2008 Agreement nor the Lease Agreement are invalid
pursuant to Moldovan law. The Tender, the July 1, 2008 Agreement, and the
Lease Agreement are State acts that were fully endorsed by Moldova, and it is on
this basis that Mr. Arif made his investment in the duty free sector. In any event,
any invalidity under Moldovan law would be inapposite to Mr. Arif under

international law.

With regard to restitution, the Tribunal should either deny Moldova’s reservation
of rights or accept such reservation and acknowledge the corollary of a request
for restitution, namely that Mr. Arif’s rights cannot be illegal under Moldovan

law.

With regard to satisfaction, Mr. Arif reiterates that his denial of justice claim is
an alternative claim and further reiterates that the Tender results, the July 1, 2008
Agreement and the Lease Agreement were all carried out in accordance with

Moldovan law. In any event, Respondent’s contention that satisfaction is the

64

appropriate remedy is unsupported by ICSID case law, as it applies solely to

State-to-State disputes.

c) Claim for Relief

305. Claimant respectfully requests the Arbitral Tribunal, without prejudice to any

other/further claims Claimant might be entitled to in this Arbitration, to:

a) Dismiss Respondent’s objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in their

entirety;

b) Find that it has jurisdiction over Mr. Arif’s claims and find Claimant’s

claims are admissible;

c) Declare that Respondent has breached its obligations toward Claimant

under the BIT and international law;

d) Order Respondent to pay Claimant damages in the amount of
€27,962,700 for Respondent’s breaches of its obligations under the BIT
and international law, which resulted in delays to the opening of all four
border duty free stores, in the loss of exclusivity at two stores, and the
taking of his investment, as set forth at paragraph 701 of Claimant’s
Reply;

d.1) Alternatively, order Respondent to pay Claimant damages in

the amount of €23,326,700, as set forth at paragraph 702 of

Claimant’s Reply;

d.2) As a second alternative, order Respondent to pay Claimant

damages in the amount of €19,149,800, as set forth at paragraph

703 of Claimant’s Reply;

d.3) As a third alternative, order Respondent to pay Claimant

damages in the amount of €16,120,800 as set forth at paragraph

704 of Claimant’s Reply.

e) Order Respondent to pay Claimant damages in the amount of

€5,407,600 for Respondent’s breaches of its obligations under the BIT

65

and international law, which prevented Claimant from ever opening his
airport duty free store, and resulted in the cancellation of the Airport
Lease Agreement;
e.1) Alternatively, order Respondent to pay Claimant the sunk
costs associated with the airport store, which amount to

€2,455,110;

f) Order Respondent to compensate Claimant in the amount of EUR
5,000,000 for the damages Claimant suffered, including harassment,
intimidation, humiliation, shame, shock, stress, degradation, loss of
personal reputation as well as loss of corporate credit affecting his

broader business activities;

g) Order Respondent to pay Claimant the costs of this arbitration,
including all expenses that he has incurred, and including all of the fees
and expenses of the arbitrators, ICSID, legal counsel, experts and

consultants, as well as Claimant’s expenses in pursuing this arbitration;

h) Order Respondent to pay Claimant compound interest at a rate of
LIBOR +2 compounded semi-annually, to be established on the above
amounts as of the date these amounts are determined to have been due to

Claimant;

i) Order Respondent to pay the above amounts outside of the Republic of

Moldova without any right of set-off; and

j) Order any other and further relief as the Arbitral Tribunal shall deem

appropriate.

306. In his letter of December 3, 2012 to ICSID, Claimant amended his claim for

relief in the following terms:

“In closing, Claimant reiterates his amended relief sought as

follows:

66

12. Claimant’s request for relief remains for compensation of
damages arising out of Moldova’s breaches of the BIT and/or
international law, which resulted in (i) the delayed opening of the
four duty free border stores, (ii) the loss of exclusivity at two
stores, (iii) the taking of his investment in respect of the four
border stores, (iv) the taking of his investment in relation to the
Airport, and (v) moral damages, namely, as set forth at paragraph
812 of the Reply:
12.1. Dismiss Respondent’s objections to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction in their entirety;
12.2. Find that it has jurisdiction over Mr. Arif’s claims and find
Claimant’s claims are admissible;
12.3. Declare that Respondent has breached its obligations toward
Claimant under the BIT and international law;
12.4. Order Respondent to pay Claimant damages in the amount of
€27,962,700 for Respondent's breaches of its obligations under the
BIT and international law, which resulted in delays to the opening
of all four border duty free stores, in the loss of exclusivity at two
stores, and the taking of his investment in respect of the border
stores, broken down, as also set forth in the Reply at paragraph
701, as follows:
© €554,791 for the delays,
© = €22,765,500 for the loss of exclusivity,
e €4,636,010 for the taking of his investment
in respect of the four border stores.
12.4.1. In the alternative, if the Tribunal believes that the
dispute in relation to the taking of Claimant’s investment in
respect of the border stores is not ripe, Claimant’s claim is
for damages in the amount of €23,326,700, as set forth at
paragraph 702 of the Reply, comprising of €554,791 for
the delays, and €22,765,500 for the loss of exclusivity,
together with the amended request for declaratory relief

set forth below at paragraph 13.

67

12.4.2. As a second alternative, if the Tribunal were to
determine that the dispute in relation to the border stores
is ripe, and in case it deems that Claimant would only have
benefited from the limited period from November 2009
until August 1, 2023, and that the border stores would be
definitively closed by 2013, Claimant’s claim is for
damages in the amount of €19,149,800, broken down, as
set forth at paragraph 703 of the Reply, as follows:

© €542,037 for the delays,

e = €15,572,400 for the loss of exclusivity,

e —€3,029,030 for the taking of his investment

in respect of the four border stores.

12.4.3. As a third alternative, if the Tribunal believes that
the dispute in relation to the taking of Claimant’s
investment in the border stores is not ripe, and in case it
deems that Claimant would only have benefited from the
limited period from November 2009 until August 1, 2023,
Claimant’s claim is for damages in the amount of
€16,120,800, as set forth at paragraph 704 of the Reply,
comprised of €542,037 for the delays, and €15,572,400 for
the loss of exclusivity, together with the amended request
for declaratory relief set forth below at paragraph 13

below.

12.5. Order Respondent to pay Claimant damages in the amount

of €5,407,600 for Respondent's breaches of its obligations under

the BIT and international law, which prevented Claimant from

ever opening his Airport duty free store, and resulted in the

cancellation of the Airport Lease Agreement;

12.5.1. Alternatively, order Respondent to pay Claimant
the sunk costs associated with the Airport store, which

amount to €2,455,110.

12.6. Order Respondent to compensate Claimant in the amount of

EUR 5,000,000 for the damages Claimant suffered, including

harassment, intimidation, humiliation, shame, shock, stress,

68

degradation, loss of personal reputation as well as loss of
corporate credit affecting his broader business activities;

12.7. Order Respondent to pay Claimant the costs of this
arbitration, including all expenses that he has incurred, and
including all of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, ICSID,
legal counsel, experts and consultants, as well as Claimant’s
expenses in pursuing this arbitration;

12.8. Order Respondent to pay Claimant compound interest at a
rate of LIBOR +2 compounded semi-annually, to be established
on the above amounts as of the date these amounts are determined
to have been due to Claimant;

12.9. Order Respondent to pay the above amounts outside of the
Republic of Moldova without any right of set-off; and

12.10. Order any other and further relief as the Arbitral Tribunal
shall deem appropriate.

13. As an alternative to Claimant’s claim for damages arising out
of the taking of the border stores, in case the Tribunal were to find
that the dispute is not ripe in respect of the taking of Claimant’s
investment in the border stores, Claimant requests a declaratory
relief to the effect that Claimant has an entitlement under
international law to continue operating the four border stores,
reinforced by an order against Respondent to pay a sum of 10,000
USD per store, per day of interruption, throughout the duration of
the four border lease agreements, plus the renewal period, i.e.
until August 1, 2038, in case Respondent or one of its organs,
authorities or agencies were to prevent the operation of the four
border stores save for any fundamental breach under
international law by Claimant of its obligations in relation to the
lease agreements.

14. In such case, the claims for damages as a result of the breach
of the BIT in relation to the delays and the loss of exclusivity will
remain unchanged, namely in the amount of €23,326,700, as set

forth at paragraph 12.4.1. above.”

ondent’s Rejoinder.-

Alleged Breaches

Expropriation: Article 5 of the BIT

307

308.

. Respondent reiterates its arguments and further alleges the following. Claimant
must demonstrate that the “investment” allegedly expropriated actually
“belonged” to him, as required by Article 5 of the BIT. All of Respondent’s
measures were aimed at the “general welfare” and fall squarely within the scope
of police powers. Claimant cannot identify any specific commitment of the State
in the Tender, the July 1, 2008 Agreement or the Lease Agreement to the effect
that the State would have exempted Le Bridge and Mr. Arif from the application
of Moldovan law as a special inducement for the investment. With regard to the
airport store, Respondent submits that the cancellation of the Lease Agreement
does not constitute an expropriation within the meaning of Article 5 of the BIT
because it resulted from the application of Moldovan law on the lease of unused
State Property to a lease that had been entered into in violation of those laws.
Respondent also alleges that successive arbitral awards have held that
expropriation by court decisions requires a finding of a denial of justice, whether
procedural or substantive. The Moldovan law on the lease of unused State assets
is not contrary to Moldova’s international obligations, Respondent argues.
Therefore, the application of that law does not put Moldova in contradiction with

its international obligations.

With regard to the exclusivity right, Respondent notes that the list of state
monopolies excluded from the scope of the Law on Protection of Competition
does not include the duty-free business, fact which Claimant himself recognized
in a letter to the Ministry of Economy. With regard to the border stores,
Respondent submits that, on October 17, 2012, the Supreme Court of Justice
overturned the decision of the Chisinau Court of Appeal of December 28, 2011
invalidating the local lease contracts and, as a result thereof, Le Bridge continues

to operate the border stores.

70

(ii) Breach of the “specific commitments” obligation: Articles 9, 5 and 4 of the BIT

309.

Respondent further alleges in relation to the July 1, 2008 Agreement that Le
Bridge and a State organ simply entered into a contract that was subject to
Moldovan law. Rather than providing any guarantee that the entire Agreement
was valid or not subject to local law, the Agreement (i) was explicitly subject to
Moldovan law and (ii) specifically contemplated the potential invalidity of
provisions by including a severability clause in Clause 20.5. Neither the NACP
nor the Moldovan Courts, which were undeniably competent to apply the law,
can be accused of having purported to accept the validity the July 1, 2008

Agreement, only to reverse that position at a later date.

(iii) Breach of FET: Article 3 of the BIT

310.

311.

312.

This is not a case of a State reneging on its own promises, but rather of the
normal operation of State regulation - moreover instigated by claims of a private
competitor, and not the government - to verify whether a private actor behaved

in conformity with the law.

Le Bridge itself committed acts in violation of Moldovan law in order to lay
claim to a number of “investment” rights. Claimant cannot now rely on these
rights to argue that these created legitimate expectations. Le Bridge entered into
those contracts with full knowledge of the risk it was taking. No State actor ever
made any representations to Mr. Arif to make him believe that he had complied

with the law.

With regard to the cancellation of the Tender by the Supreme Court on
November 24, 2010, Respondent further argues that it is entirely consistent with
the proper administration of the State that the judiciary should review and cancel
contractual arrangements when those have been entered into by reason of a
misrepresentation made by the investor, as that is the only guarantee of fair and

open competition.

(viii)

Arbitrary and unreasonable measures: Article 4 of the BIT

313. Given that Claimant has refused to withdraw this improper claim, despite

admitting to its flaws, Respondent requests that the Tribunal dismiss it.
Full Protection and Security: Article 5 of the BIT

314. Claimant has failed entirely to make an independent claim of violation of the full
protection and security obligation. The BIT addresses FPS and FET in two

separate articles.
Discriminatory measures: Article 4 of the BIT

315. Respondent further alleges that it does not accept that non-discrimination is a

stand-alone standard of the Treaty, as opposed to an element of FET.
Denial of Justice

316. Respondent further submits that all of Claimant’s arguments relating to the court
proceedings are at their heart merely requests that this Tribunal review and
reconsider decisions of the Moldovan judiciary as if they were before it on

appeal.
Compensation

317. Respondent has already refuted Mr. Arif’s claim that he should be compensated

even if no illegal expropriation is established.
b) Reparation

318. With regard to causation, should the Tribunal find that Mr. Arif and Le Bridge
did act illegally, but agree with Claimant that this is irrelevant, then, even if
Respondent’s judicial and competition authorities violated international legal
norms when they reacted to that illegality, it remains the case that, but for Mr.

Arif’s and Le Bridge’s unlawful acts, Claimant would have suffered no harm.

319. With regard to restitution, should the Tribunal find that it has jurisdiction in this

case and that Moldova has committed one or more internationally wrongful acts,

72

Respondent requests that it should be granted the right to determine within 60
days, in light of each of the breaches thus found, if restitution appears materially
possible and, in that case, to provide restitution as an alternative to any damages
the Tribunal may award. Such a remedy would put Claimant exactly in the
position he would have been in had there not been any violation of the BIT. Such
aremedy would avoid giving Claimant windfall profits for the exclusivity that he

seeks to obtain by an order of damages.

320. With regard to satisfaction, should the Tribunal find that the Moldovan judiciary
engaged in egregious conduct amounting to a procedural denial of justice, but
that Mr. Arif’s investments were in any event unlawful, then a declaration of
wrongfulness and an apology for the conduct of the courts would be the

appropriate remedy.
c) Claim for Relief

21. For the foregoing reasons, Respondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to:

a) Declare that it does not have jurisdiction over Claimant's claims;

b) To the extent it decides it has jurisdiction over Claimant's claims for a
breach of a “specific undertaking,” declare that such claims are

inadmissible;

c) To the extent it decides it has jurisdiction over Claimant's claims, and
that they are admissible, declare that Respondent has not breached any of

its obligations toward Claimant;

d) To the extent it decides that Respondent committed an internationally
wrongful act through a denial of justice, declare that satisfaction by way of

a declaration of wrongfulness is the appropriate form of reparation;
e) To the extent it declares Respondent responsible for any internationally

wrongful acts towards Claimant for which compensation is required, decide

that Respondent's duty of reparation shall be in the form of either

73

restitution, to be provided at Respondent’s option within 60 days of receipt
of the final award, or payment in amounts not to exceed those indicated in

paragraphs 826/827 of the Counter-Memorial;

f) To the extent it declares Respondent liable to pay damages for the
expropriation of any investment, to order Claimant to transfer all rights and
interests in such investments to Respondent upon payment of the ordered

damages; and

g) Order Claimant to pay Respondent's expenses (including legal and expert
fees and disbursements) and the other costs of the arbitration, pursuant to
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Article 47(1)(j) of the ICSID

Arbitration Rules.

322. In its letter of December 3, 2012 to ICSID Respondent stated that: “Respondent
indicated at the hearing, restitution of exclusivity rights would in the event not be
possible to implement, as such rights would violate the mandatory rules of
Moldovan law on the protection of competition... Respondent does not consider
it necessary to amend the relief requested at paragraph 490(E) of the Rejoinder,

as set out above, except as clarified in this letter with respect to exclusivity.”

V. JURISDICTION.-

A. Provisions Applicable to the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction.-

323. The provisions applicable to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction are Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention and Articles 1 and 7 of the BIT.

324. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention reads in its relevant part:
“(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute
arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the

Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which

74

the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When
the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent
unilaterally.

(2) “National of another Contracting State” means:

(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State
other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties
consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as
on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph
(3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any
person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting

State party to the dispute...”

325. Article 7 of the BIT is entitled “Settlement of disputes between an investor and a
Contracting Party” and reads:

“Any disputes relating to investments between one of the Contracting

Parties and a national or a company of the other Contracting Party will

be settled amicably between the two parties involved.

If such dispute cannot be settled within six month following a party to the
disputes’ raising of it, it will be submitted, at the request of one of these
parties, to the arbitration of the International Centre for the Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID), created by the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of Other States,

signed in Washington, on March 18, 1965.”
326. Article 1 of the BIT contains the definition of the term “investment” and
“national” and reads in its relevant part:

“For the purposes of the application of this Treaty:

1) The term “investment” means all the assets, such as goods, rights and

interests of all kinds and, particularly, but not exclusively:

75

a) movable and immovable assets, as well as all other property
rights, such as mortgages, privileges, beneficial rights, guarantees

and all similar rights;

b) Shares, share premiums and other forms of participation, even
minor or indirect, in companies established in the territory of one

of the Contracting Parties;

c) Bonds, receivables, and claims to any performance having an

economic value;

d) Intellectual, commercial and industrial property rights, such as
copyrights, patents, licenses, registered trademarks, industrial
models and prototypes, technical processes, know-how, brand

names and goodwill;

e) Concessions granted by law or under an agreement, namely
concessions concerning research, exploitation, extraction or
mining of natural resources, including those located in the

maritime area of the Parties.

It is understood that the mentioned assets must be or have been invested
in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party, on the
territory or maritime area of which the investment is made, before or

after the entry into force of the present Agreement...

...2) The term “nationals” means any natural person having the nationality of

one of the Contracting Parties...”

B.

Analysis.-

Admissibility of Respondent’s Objections to Jurisdiction.-

327. Rule 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules states: “Any objection that the dispute

328.

32

330.

io}

9.

S

or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other
reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as
possible. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than
the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if
the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder-unless

the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.”

Respondent requested an extension for the filing of its Counter-Memorial by
letter of April 2, 2012. Under the authority granted to the Tribunal by the Parties,
pursuant to Sections 10.2 and 13.3 of the Minutes of the First Session, by letter
of the Secretariat to the Parties on behalf of the Tribunal of April 5, 2012,'! the
Tribunal amended the calendar of the proceedings granting to Respondent an
extension for the filing of its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction, merits, and

quantum until May 31, 2012.

Respondent filed its jurisdictional objections with its Counter-Memorial within
the time limit fixed in the amended calendar, in compliance with Article 41(1) of
the Arbitration Rules. Moreover, the Tribunal is satisfied that Respondent filed
its jurisdictional objections in good faith as early as possible in light of the
amended procedural calendar. Claimant’s argument that the Tribunal has
authority to amend time limits for the filing of the Counter-Memorial but not for
the filing of jurisdictional objections finds no support in the ICSID Arbitration
Rules and is based in an improper reading of Article 41(1) of the Arbitration

Rules. Therefore it is rejected by this Tribunal.

Accordingly, Claimant’s objections to the admissibility of Respondent’s

objections to jurisdiction are rejected.

Amicable Settlement.-

331.

332.

333.

334.

Article 7 of the BIT provides:
“Any disputes relating to investments between one of the Contracting
Parties and a national or company of the other Contracting Party will be

settled amicably between the two parties involved.

If such dispute cannot be settled within six month following a party to the
disputes’ raising of it, it will be submitted, at the request of one of these
parties, to the arbitration of the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID), created by the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of Other States, signed

in Washington, on March 18, 1965.”

Article 26 of the ICSID Convention provides that: “Consent of the parties to
arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed
consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting
State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as

a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention.”

Firstly, the Tribunal notes that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention constitutes an
express waiver of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies in ICSID arbitrations.
The Tribunal further notes that Article 7 of the BIT does not provide for the

exhaustion of local remedies before arbitration can commence.

In light of the above, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that there is no general
requirement to exhaust local remedies for a treaty claim to exist (unless such a
claim is for denial of justice). The fact that the alleged wrongful acts mainly
relate to acts of the judiciary does not necessarily mean that local remedies
should be exhausted before an international claim can arise. A court may violate

a BIT standard directly and this breach will be attributable to the respondent

78

m2

337.

6.

a

State without there being any requirement to exhaust local remedies, unless it is

a breach for denial of justice.'!!

Therefore, the Tribunal rejects Respondent’s argument that no dispute existed
when Mr. Arif sent his notice on May 14, 2010 because first instance court
decisions cannot be deemed to engage the State’s responsibility and the dispute
was not ripe for this reason.

112

The Tribunal further notes that in the letter of May 14, 2010°~ to Respondent,
Claimant refers not only to wrongful acts by the judiciary, but also to “abusive
acts of the authorities of the Republic of Moldova” and the “lack of adequate
actions of the authorized central public authorities.” Claimant is therefore
alleging wrongful acts not only of the Moldovan judiciary, but also of other

organs of Moldova.

Secondly, in his letter of May 14, 2010, Claimant expressly states that: “This
note is being sent under Article 7 of the Agreement on Mutual Encouragement
and Protection of Investments as of 08.09.1997 entered into by the Government
of the Republic of Moldova and the Government of the French Republic
(Bilateral Agreement) and is aimed at amiably solving the investment dispute
that arose between the Republic of Moldova and the foreign investor Arif Franck
Charles, citizen of the French Republic.” Claimant makes it clear that he
considers this letter to be a notice for purposes of compliance with the “cooling
off” period in Article 7 of the BIT. Claimant identifies therein three possible
breaches of the BIT: a breach for unlawful expropriation, a breach of the Full
Protection and Security standard (“FPS”) and a breach of the Fair and Equitable
Treatment standard (“FET”). Finally, Claimant states that: “The foreign investor
Arif Franck Charles, citizen of the French Republic has declared to be open for
any constructive suggestion aimed at amicable and effective settlement of
appeared disagreements by means of elimination of illegal and destructive

actions related to investments of the undersigned.”

"! See Newcombe A., Paradell, L., Law and Practice of Investment Treaties. Standards of Treatment,
Kluwer Law International, 2009, para. 6.6.

See Letter from Claimant to the Government of Moldova, dated May 14, 2010, Exhibit C-34 to
Request for Arbitration.

79

338. On July 12, 2011, Claimant sent a second letter seeking to settle the dispute
amicably.''? Although by July 2011 the dispute had significantly aggravated, the
Tribunal finds that Claimant’s allegations in the above letter, which Respondent
admits does contain a description of the dispute now at stake before the
Tribunal,''* are essentially the same as those contained in his letter of May 14,
2010: a breach for unlawful expropriation, a breach of FET and a breach of
FPS''° due to wrongful acts of both the judiciary and of other organs of the
Republic of Moldova. Therefore, even if the letter under consideration further
develops the allegations made by Claimant in his letter of May 14, 2010, mainly
in light of the aggravation of the dispute, the essence of Claimant’s complaints is
the same in both letters. The Tribunal therefore rejects Respondent’s argument
that the nature and scope of the claims raised in the letter of May 14, 2010 are
entirely different from the claims at stake in this arbitration. In this letter,

Claimant reiterated his desire to settle the dispute amicably.''®

339. Moreover, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the notice of a dispute need
not be detailed or exhaustive. The Tribunal agrees with the Salini Tribunal’s
finding that: “The Tribunal considers that the attempt to reach an amicable
settlement should essentially include the existence of grounds for complaint and

the desire to resolve these matters out-of-court. It need not be complete or

detailed”.''’ The International Court of Justice has defined a dispute as “a
disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests
between the parties.”''* The Tribunal is satisfied that the letter of May 14, 2010

was a valid notice of a dispute between the Parties, irrespective of the actual

"5 See Notice Letter sent by Derains & Gharavi to Respondent, dated July 12, 2011, Exhibit C-35 to
Request for Arbitration.

"4 See Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 318.

"5 See Notice Letter sent by Derains & Gharavi to Respondent, dated July 12, 2011, Exhibit C-35 to
Request for Arbitration, in which Claimant further alleges a breach for discriminatory and arbitrary
measures.

"6 See Notice Letter sent by Derains & Gharavi to Respondent, dated July 12, 2011, Exhibit C-35 to
Request for Arbitration, para. 30: “Yet, we hereby call, in a last effort to settle this dispute amicably, for
the amicable resolution of the dispute. Failing a positive response within two weeks committing to
amicably resolve the dispute, however we will have no choice but to initiate ICSID proceedings for the
settlement of this dispute.”

"7 See Claimant’s Reply, para. 205 and Salini Costruttori S.pA and Italstrade S.p.A v. Kingdom of
Morocco, Decision on Jurisdiction of July 16, 2001, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, para. 20.

existence or validity of the specific legal rights involved. Therefore, it rejects
Respondent’s argument that no dispute with regard to the airport store could
have existed in May 2010 because Le Bridge had not yet obtained the Security
Certificate for the store (which it only obtained on June 18, 2010).

340. The Tribunal further notes that the fact that by May 14, 2010 the Republic of

'° is irrelevant for a finding

Moldova had not yet ratified the ICSID Convention’
of a dispute under the BIT and for the assessment of Moldova’s opportunity to
engage in settlement discussions with Claimant. Claimant sent two formal letters
to Respondent giving notice of the existence of a dispute and expressing his
willingness to find an amicable solution with Respondent. In light of the record,
the Tribunal rejects Respondent’s arguments that it never had a fair opportunity
to engage in settlement discussions at any time after the dispute had actually
ripened and that Mr. Arif did not pursue in good faith the negotiations he had
started.

341. The Tribunal therefore finds that Claimant’s letter of May 14, 2010 is a valid
notice of a dispute for the purposes of Article 7 of the BIT. The Request for
Arbitration was filed on July 29, 2011, i.e. more than 14 months after the first
notice of a dispute. Consequently, the Tribunal decides that the “cooling off”
period of six months provided for in Article 7 has been amply complied with by

Claimant.

342. Given the finding that Claimant complied with the “cooling off’ period in
Article 7, the Tribunal need not address the remaining arguments of the Parties
regarding this objection. For the above reasons, Respondent’s objection to
jurisdiction on the grounds of a failure by Claimant to comply with the amicable

settlement provision in Article 7 is dismissed.
3. Ripeness of the Claims.-

343. The Tribunal notes that Respondent does not raise its objection to jurisdiction on

the basis of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. It already noted above that the
19 The ICSID Convention was ratified by Moldova on May 2011.

81

BIT contains no requirement to exhaust local remedies before commencing

arbitration.

344. According to Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: “The conduct
of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international
law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other
function. 7120

345. The ICSID system is not intended to be a subsidiary system of dispute settlement

in case the host State’s legal system fails, but rather it is set up as an alternative
to the host State’s remedies in case of an investment dispute. As already
mentioned above, there is no general requirement to exhaust local remedies for a
treaty claim to exist, unless such a claim is for denial of justice. In a claim for
denial of justice, the conduct of the whole judicial system is relevant, while in a
claim for expropriation, it is the individual action of an organ of the State that is

decisive, |!

346. Even for claims for denial of justice, the exhaustion of local remedies is a
question to be addressed with the merits of the dispute. It is a substantive

standard, rather than a procedural bar. 122

Moreover, according to ICSID case
law, no such substantive requirement applies in principle to expropriation

claims!”

347.

a

In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that, as a matter of principle, in
accordance with Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, court

decisions can engage a State’s responsibility, including for unlawful

expropriation, without there being any requirement to exhaust local remedies
(unless claims for denial of justice have been made). Respondent’s argument that
there can be no international wrongful act or Treaty dispute arising from a court
decision until the entire justice system has heard the case is therefore rejected.
The Tribunal notes that to develop this argument Respondent has only relied on

cases where a denial of justice claim was under consideration.

348. In other words, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Arif’s claims for complete
expropriation and breach of specific undertakings regarding the border duty free
stores are jurisdictionally ripe for arbitration, notwithstanding the fact that the
Supreme Court of Justice’s decision of October 17, 2012 overturned the decision
of the Chisinau Court of Appeal of December 28, 2011 regarding the validity of
the local lease agreements, and that the case was sent back to the lower courts for

further proceedings.

349. The decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of October 17, 2012 and its
potential effects, if any, over the alleged claims under the BIT, is a question to be

addressed with the merits.

350. In light of the Tribunal’s finding that the claims are jurisdictionally ripe for
arbitration, notwithstanding the decision of the Supreme Court of October 17,
2012, there is no need to address the remaining arguments made by the Parties

regarding this objection.

351.

For the above reasons, Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction with regard to the
claims in relation to the creation and opening of the border duty free stores (i.e.:
claim for complete expropriation and for breach of specific undertakings
regarding the border stores) based on the lack of ripeness of these claims, is

dismissed.
4. Nationality.-

352. Article 1(2) of the BIT provides that: “The term “nationals” means any natural

person having the nationality of one of the Contracting Parties.”

83

353. And Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention provides that “national of another
Contracting State” means “...any natural person who had the nationality of a
Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which
the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as
well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph
(3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person
who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the

dispute...”

354. The Tribunal notes that both Parties agree that it is an established principle of
international law that a State is sovereign in establishing the legal conditions
which must be fulfilled by an individual in order to be considered to be vested
with its nationality. In other words, nationality is within the domestic jurisdiction
of the State.'** The Tribunal finds that it has the authority to review the
nationality of Claimant at the relevant dates as per Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID

. 3
Convention.'?°

355. The Tribunal further notes that Respondent is not alleging that Mr. Arif did not
hold French nationality under Decree dated March 10, 2005 at any of the
relevant dates pursuant to Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, but rather
alleges that Claimant’s nationality was not granted in accordance with French

law, implying that the Decree granting nationality of March 10, 2005 is invalid.

356. It is undisputed between the Parties that Claimant was granted French nationality

by Decree dated March 10, 2005.'"° The Tribunal finds that this is strong and

"4 See Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 350; Claimant’s Reply, para. 268.

"5 The Parties seem to agree on this point. See Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 17 where Claimant’s counsel
states that: “...The Arbitral Tribunal, you have obligation, the duty, the right to check the nationality of the
Claimant at the date of the request for arbitration, and on the date of registration...” and p. 91 where
counsel for Respondent states that: “/t is not disputed that French law applies and it is well established,
and I think it was virtually admitted this morning, that this tribunal, or in general, at least, international
tribunals have the authority to review and in fact must review the nationality of a claimant...”

26See French Naturalisation Decree, Official Journal of the French Republic, dated March 12, 2005,
Exhibit R-17 to Respondent’s Counter-Memorial. Respondent admitted at the first day of the Hearing that
the Decree is a constitutional act, i.e. that the Decree is the act that grants nationality under French law, as
opposed to a certificate of nationality which is a declaratory act which is simply prima facie evidence for
nationality (see Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 230 and 231). This admission from Respondent at the
Hearing contrasts with its previous position regarding this issue under which “a Decree of naturalisation

357.

358.

359.

convincing evidence that Mr. Arif acquired French nationality in accordance
with French law. Claimant has also presented his French passport and his French

nationality identity card before this Tribunal. '°7

This Tribunal does not consider appropriate to exercise its control over the
French authorities’ decision to grant French nationality to Mr. Arif. Following

2

the reasoning of the Tribunal in Micula, '* it would only be inclined to disregard
the decision of the French authorities if “there was convincing and decisive
evidence” that Mr Arif’s acquisition of French nationality “was fraudulent or at
least resulted from a material error. It is for Respondent to make the showing.
For this purpose casting doubt is not sufficient.” Respondent has not proved that
Mr. Arif’s nationality was obtained fraudulently or resulted from a material error

of the French authorities.

This Tribunal is therefore satisfied of Claimant’s French nationality for the
purposes of requesting international arbitration protection. It further notes that
neither the BIT nor the Convention include an express requirement that
nationality has to be acquired in conformity with the national law of the host
State. Had this been the case, it might have opened the door for the Tribunal’s
investigation of Claimant’s file pursuant to which he was granted nationality by

the French authorities.

Respondent further alleges that even if Claimant is deemed to have acquired
French nationality legally, he has not established effective links with France. The
Tribunal notes that neither Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, nor the BIT
require the application of the effective nationality principle. The Tribunal
moreover notes that the effective nationality test has little support in ICSID

proceedings and that there is a clear reluctance to apply the test where only one

 

QT

is itself no proof of nationality as a matter of French law, pursuant to Article 30 of the French Civil
Code...contrary to a certificate of French nationality.” (see Respondent’s Rejoinder, para. 29).

National Identity Card, Exhibit C-2 to Request for Arbitration.

Jurisdiction and Admissibility (September 24, 2008), paras. 94 and 95.

85

nationality is at issue.'”’This is the case here'*° and therefore the Tribunal is not

persuaded that an effective nationality test is applicable.

360. In light of the above, it is not necessary to address the additional arguments of
the Parties regarding the issue of nationality. The Tribunal dismisses
Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction ratione personae based on Mr. Arif’s lack

of French nationality for the reasons stated above.

5. Investment.-

361. Article 1(1) of the BIT provides the definition of “investment”:
“The term “investment” means all the assets, such as goods, rights and

interests of all kinds and, particularly, but not exclusively:

a) movable and immovable assets, as well as all other property rights,
such as mortgages, privileges, beneficial rights, guarantees and all

similar rights;

b) Shares, share premiums and other forms of participation, even minor
or indirect, in companies established in the territory of one of the

Contracting Parties;

c) Bonds, receivables, and claims to any performance having an

economic value;

d) Intellectual, commercial and industrial property rights, such as

copyrights, patents, licenses, registered trademarks, industrial models

See Schreuer, C.H., The ICSID Convention. A Commentary, Second Edition, 2010, Cambridge
University Press, p. 266-267; see also oan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. Romania, (CSID Case No.
ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (September 24, 2008), paras. 98-103. The
Tribunal notes that Respondent actually admits this test to be relatively exceptional, see Hearing
Transcript, Day 1, p. 1 's, it is relatively exceptional, as was mentioned this morning, but the
concept of effective nationality actually survives in ICSID...

'° Claimant alleges that Mr. Arif lost Iraqi nationality when he gained French nationality in 2005,
pursuant to Article 11(1) of Law No. (46) of 1963 on Iraqi Nationality, Exhibit C-220 to Claimant's
Reply. Respondent accepts that this is not a case involving dual or multiple nationalities (see Respondent's
Rejoinder, para.

and prototypes, technical processes, know-how, brand names and

goodwill;

e) Concessions granted by law or under an agreement, namely
concessions concerning research, exploitation, extraction or mining of
natural resources, including those located in the maritime area of the

Parties.

It is understood that the mentioned assets must be or have been invested
in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party, on the
territory or maritime area of which the investment is made, before or

after entry into force of the present Agreement.

Any modification of the form of the assets’ investment does not affect its

 

as an i tL I ided that this does not

contravene the legislation of the Contracting Party in whose territory or

maritime area the investment was made.”

The ICSID Convention contains no definition of “investment”.

Firstly, the Tribunal considers that it is important to clarify what is exactly the
“investment” the protection of which is alleged to have been breached in this

case.

Claimant in his Reply defines his investment as follows:
“331.1. The rights arising out of the Tender and State Agreements,

namely:

331.1.1The exclusive right to create and develop a duty free
network at five border stores, granted by the State tender
and corresponding State Agreements entered into with the
Customs Service of Moldova on a long term basis, namely

15 years with a priority right of renewal;

87

331.1.2The right to open a flagship store at the Airport, granted
by the Lease Agreement entered into with the Airport State
Enterprise on a long term basis, namely a seven year and

five months period with a priority right of renewal.

331.2. Claimant’s shareholding in Le Bridge;

331.3. The creation of Le Bridge’s duty free division, Le Bridge Travel

Retail, with its own departments and premises;

331.4. The renovations of the premises where the Airport store would be

located;

331.5. The construction of four duty free stores at the Romanian border;

331.6. Securing luxury goods and the support of luxury brands;

331.7. The development of the “Le Bridge Duty Free” brand and
trademark at the international level, through the sale of luxurious
products, including inter alia, items from Chopard, Guerlain, Bulgari and
La Prairie, events and national advertising campaigns on billboards, the
internet, television and in newspapers and magazines and Mr. Arif’s

know-how contributions;

331.8. Hiring of qualified management and staff;

331.9. The launch of Le Bridge Travel Retail; and

331.10. The application and attribution of all required authorizations and
licences to build duty free stores and operate the duty free business, and

the right to use the premises as per the Agreements with the Customs

Service and the Airport State Enterprise.”

The Parties agree that paragraph 331.1 of the Reply defines the ‘core’ rights in
dispute in this arbitration.'*! Claimant further argues that even if some elements
of this list “do not qualify as an investment pursuant to the BIT, the operation as
a whole would still qualify as an investment.”'” Claimant also argues that if the
rights arising from the Tender and State Agreements fall within the definition of
investment, then Mr. Arif’s further steps in furtherance of these rights, as set out

in paragraphs 331.2 to 331.10 of the Reply, are also investments.'*?

Respondent does not accept Claimant’s theory of the unity of the investment. It
states that Claimant has not demonstrated that many of the alleged elements of
the investments exist as rights under Moldovan law, which is the law applicable

to the definition of the rights.'**

As to the ‘core’ rights referred to in paragraph
331.1, they “were acquired by Mr. Arif in violation of Moldovan law and are by

operation of that law, invalid.”'*

Claimant concentrates on specific rights arising from his agreements with
Respondent, and particularly the right of exclusivity allegedly confirmed by the
Tender and the July 1, 2008 Agreement. The Tribunal considers that this
approach confuses the “investment” with the individual rights of particular
value. Where multiple contracts are entered into by an investor, then it is
sufficient that the contracts and their good faith performance as a whole satisfy
the definition of an investment, and Claimant does not need to go further and

justify individual rights in the contracts.

The question as to whether a particular right granted by an agreement is valid or
invalid may affect liability or the valuation of damages, but is not a question of
jurisdiction.

In the present case, the Tribunal is satisfied that the agreements entered into by

 

Claimant with Moldova (the Lease Agreement, the July 1, 2008 Agreement, and

the subsequent agreements with the individual customs offices) are ‘assets’

within the meaning of Article 1 of the BIT.

370. The dispute in this arbitration arises from these agreements and the beginning of
their performance, and Claimant seeks damages arising from the alleged loss of
these agreements, the rights derived from them, and his good faith belief that
they were valid. The Tribunal can consider events preceding these agreements,
such as the Tender, and the steps taken by Claimant in execution of the rights
they conferred without needing to individually consider whether preliminary or
subsequent steps satisfy the definition of investment. These agreements
constituted an investment within the meaning of Article 1 of the BIT. This is
sufficient to confer jurisdiction on this Tribunal over a dispute relating to
Respondent’s treatment of such agreements and the steps taken by Claimant on

the basis thereof.

371.

Respondent has a further argument that the alleged rights under the Tender, the
July 1, 2008 Agreement, and the Airport Lease Agreement are invalid under
Moldovan law, and therefore “even if they could have fulfilled the Treaty’s
definition (under international law) of ‘investments’ if they validly existed, they

are in any event not capable of grounding the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”'°°

372. This argument relies on the part of the definition of “investment” in Article 1(1)
that states that: “Jt is understood that the mentioned assets must be or have been

invested in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party.”

373. The investments in dispute in the present case have been declared invalid by the
Moldovan judiciary, including by the Supreme Court, except for the local lease
agreements which are still under consideration by the Moldovan courts. In
particular the July 1, 2008 Agreement and the Tender were declared invalid by

137

decisions of the Economic Circuit Court of May 28, 2010,~° the Economic

Court of Appeal of September 7, 2010,'** and the Supreme Court of Justice of
November 24, 2010.'*? The Lease Agreement was invalidated by decisions of
the Economic Circuit Court of November 16, 2010,'*° the Economic Court of
Appeal of February 28, 2011,'*! and the Supreme Court of Justice of June 10,
2011.'?

Respondent’s argument based on the invalidity of the Lease Agreement and the
July 1, 2008 Agreement is formalistic in that it relies on a judicially declared
invalidity that applies retrospectively to the date of the investment. The reality
was that at the time the investment was made, and for many months thereafter,
both Parties believed and were allowed to trust that the July 1, 2008 Agreement
and the Lease Agreement were valid, and that the investment had been made in
accordance with the legislation of Moldova. Both Parties acted in good faith on

this basis.

In fact, the process by which the Lease Agreement and the July 1, 2008
Agreement were declared invalid, and the actions in furtherance thereof, are the
basis of Claimant’s claims pursuant to the BIT in this arbitration. Respondent
seeks to rely on its own law and decisions of its own courts to deny juridical
existence to agreements that existed in fact, and were relied upon by both

Parties.

There are temporal limitations on a jurisdictional argument based on the
illegality of an investment, where the legality of the investment has been
accepted and acted upon in good faith by both parties over a period of time. This
is not a case of a concealed illegality, or a class of assets prohibited to foreign

investors such as, in some jurisdictions, a concession contract for a strategic

resource. The investment was not made fraudulently or on the basis of
corruption. In cases like the present one, the passage of time and the actions of
the parties on the mutual assumption of legality cannot be ignored in the
determination of jurisdiction. The ‘normative power of facticity’ requires
illegality in a case like the present one to be treated as an issue of liability and

not jurisdiction.

Respondent also alleges that it is a settled proposition in international law that a
shareholder may not seek protection for injuries to companies it owns.’
Respondent further alleges that only direct investments are protected under the

Bit.“

The Tribunal notes that the BIT does not define the term “investor”. Article 7
refers to “Any disputes relating to investments between one of the Contracting
Parties and a national or a company of the other Contracting party...”. The term
national is defined in Article 1(2) of the BIT as “any natural person having the
nationality of one of the contracting Parties.” The term “investment” is defined

in a broad and non-exhaustive manner in Article 1(1) of the BIT.

The BIT does not limit or restrict the protection granted to direct investments. In
fact, under Article 1(1)(b), which refers to “Shares, share premiums and other
forms of participation, even minor or indirect, in companies established in the
territory of one of the Contracting Parties”, indirect investments are expressly
included within the definition of investment. Therefore, Respondent’s argument

to the contrary is rejected.

In addition, the Tribunal finds that shareholder protection is not restricted to
ownership in the shares, it extends to the assets of the company.'*> Mr. Arif is
the sole shareholder of Le Bridge and has to be afforded protection under the

BIT accordingly.

381.

383.

384.

Finally, Respondent alleges that Claimant’s “investment” further fails to qualify
as such for the purposes of the BIT and the ICSID Convention because of the

absence of any transfer of capital or technology from France to Moldova.'**

The fact that the preamble of the BIT provides that “Persuaded that the
encouragement and protection of such investments will stimulate the transfer of
capital and technology between the two States, in the interest of their economic
development’, cannot be read as a requirement of the term “investment”, which
is expressly defined in Article 1(1) and which clearly makes no mention of any

such requirement.

The ICSID Convention does not impose any such requirement either. Moreover,
under ICSID jurisprudence, Tribunals have generally found the origin of capital
used in investments immaterial. According to doctrinal authorities, the origin of
the funds is irrelevant for purposes of jurisdiction. Whether investments are
made from imported capital, from profits made locally, from payments received
locally or from loans raised locally, makes no difference to the degree of

protection enjoyed.'*”

In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the July 1, 2008 Agreement, the
Lease Agreement and the local lease agreements qualify as an “investment”,
both under the BIT and the ICSID Convention, and rejects Respondent’s
arguments to the contrary. Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction based on
Claimant not having an investment subject to Treaty protection is therefore

dismissed.

6. Specific Undertakings.-

385.

Article 9 of the BIT is entitled “Specific Commitments” and provides that:
“Investments having been the subject of a particular [the] specific commitment
of one of the Contracting Parties towards the nationals and companies of the

other Contracting Party, are regulated, without prejudice to the dispositions of

46 See Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 493.

University Press, p. 136, 137.

93

the present Agreement, by the provisions of such commitment as far as it
contains more favourable provisions than those provided for in the present

Agreement.”

386.

a

Article 5(2) of the BIT provides with regard to expropriation that: “The
Contracting Parties shall not take any measures of expropriation... save for a
public purpose and on the condition that such measures not be discriminatory or

contrary to a specific commitment.”

387. The interpretation of the BIT as a public international law instrument is subject
to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. According to its Article 31(1):
“[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of

its object and purpose.”

388.

oO

Firstly, the ordinary meaning of these Articles within their context and in light of
the BIT’s object and purpose makes the Tribunal find that Article 9 (and Article
5(2) to the extent that it refers to “a specific commitment”) has its own specific
meaning and purpose, separate from that of an “umbrella” clause, and agrees
with Respondent in this regard. According to the ordinary meaning of the text,
the specific purpose of these clauses is not to guarantee the observation of
obligations assumed by the host State vis-a-vis the investor, but rather to provide
investors with the right to claim the application of any rule of law more
favourable than the provisions of the BIT. The doctrine refers to such clauses as

. 5 148
preservation of rights clauses.

389.

©

This type of clause, in its usual wording, simply says that in applying or
enforcing the existing protections offered by the BIT, attention should be paid to
any more favourable provisions contained in domestic law or specific

agreements. It therefore confirms that the investor may benefit from more

8 See Newcombe, A., Paradell, L., Law and Practice of Investment Treaties. Standards of Treatment,
Kluwer Law International, 2009, p. 477.

94

favourable treatment, but does not add a new, specific or distinct, treaty

obligation to respect commitments made.'*

390. The position of Article 9 within the BIT further confirms the Tribunal’s finding.
Article 9 is included at the end of the BIT and after the BIT’s dispute resolution
clause (Article 7), instead of with the rest of the BIT’s substantive standards of

protection (Articles 2 to 6).

391.

The interpretation of these Articles as preservation of rights clauses in any event
does not deprive them of their effet utile, which is precisely to ensure that the
investment enjoys the most favourable legal regime. They have their own
legitimate function within the BIT, which relates to the specific issue of what is
the law applicable to the investment. The Tribunal does not accept that the
interpretation of these Articles as preservation of rights clauses would turn them

into a tautology, leading to an absurd result not intended by the Parties.

392. Therefore, the Tribunal does not find that these Articles are “umbrella” clauses,
but rather preservation of rights clauses, even though it does not completely

agree with Respondent’s reading of them either.

393. Secondly, Claimant alleges that, even if the Tribunal could not find that Articles
9 and 5 are “umbrella” clauses, in any case an “umbrella” clause would be

imported into the BIT via the MFN clause contained in its Article 4.

394. Article 4 of the BIT provides in its relevant part as follows: “Each Contracting
Party shall extend, in its territory and in its maritime area, to nationals and
companies of the other Contracting Party, regarding their investments and
activities connected with these investments, treatment not less favourable than
that granted to its nationals or companies, or treatment granted to the nationals

and companies of the most favoured nation, if the latter is more favourable...”

See Newcombe, A., Paradell, L., Law and Practice of Investment Treaties. Standards of Treatment,
Kluwer Law International, 2009, p. 478.

95

395. The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that “umbrella” clauses are substantive in
nature. A breach of specific undertakings covered by an “umbrella” clause will
give rise to a substantive breach of the BIT.'*’ In this sense, the Tribunal rejects
Respondent’s argument that “umbrella” clauses are procedural in nature and
cannot be imported through an MFN clause because they give a means of
protection for contractual and other undertakings, rather than a unique standard

«1S
of behaviour.

396. Both Parties agree that an MFN clause applies to substantive obligations.'** The
MEN clause in Article 4 is broadly drafted and does not restrict its application to
any particular kind of substantive obligation under the BIT. Therefore, the
Tribunal finds that the MFN clause of the BIT can import an “umbrella” clause
(which is substantive in nature), from either the Moldova-UK or Moldova-USA
BIT'*, thereby extending the more favourable standard of protection granted by
the “umbrella” clause in either one of these BIT’s into the BIT at hand.
Respondent’s arguments to the contrary are rejected. The Tribunal therefore has
jurisdiction over Claimant’s “specific commitments” claim via the MFN clause

of Article 4.

397. The Tribunal moreover notes that the whole debate of whether there is an
“umbrella” clause in the BIT, be it directly through Articles 5 and 9, be it
indirectly via Article 4, is not a jurisdictional matter, even though the Parties
have chosen to argue it as such. The issue in dispute between the Parties is

whether a specific substantive standard of treatment is included in the BIT and

'S° See Newcombe, A., Paradell, L., Law and Practice of Investment Treaties. Standards of Treatment,
Kluwer Law International, 2009, p. 466: “For the majority of scholars, the clause imposes a substantive
treaty obligation on the host state to comply with its undertakings towards investments, including
contractual commitments. Any non-compliance with or breach of such undertakings, even if of a
commercial nature, constitutes a violation of this treaty obligation.”

'S! See Respondent’s Rejoinder, para. 215.

‘2 Respondent admits that substantive standards included in other agreements could be “imported” to the
dispute at hand pursuant to the application of the MEN clause (see Respondent’s Rejoinder, para. 215).

'53 See Exhibit C-L2, Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Moldova of March 19, 1996 (and which entered

this is a merits issue, which in any case confirms the Tribunals’ jurisdiction over

this claim.

398. Finally, the Tribunal notes that the July 1, 2008 Agreement and the Lease
Agreement, as well as the rights under the award of the Tender, on which
Claimant’s “specific commitments” claim rely, have been irrevocably annulled
by the whole of the Moldovan judicial system, up to the Supreme Court. The
validity of these instruments has been extensively debated before the Moldovan
courts, which have consistently, repeatedly and irrevocably decided that these
instruments were invalid under Moldovan law. This Tribunal is persuaded that
there has been no denial of justice towards the investor and that the judiciary has
applied Moldovan law legitimately and in good faith (see Section VI.B.2). This
Tribunal cannot and should not act as a court of appeal of last resort. Under these
circumstances, it does not consider appropriate to decide on Claimant’s “specific
undertakings” claim to the extent it implies analysing ex novo the validity of
these instruments under Moldovan law. This issue has already been decided by
the Moldovan courts. For this reason Claimant’s claim on specific undertakings

is inadmissible.

399. In light of the above, the Tribunal need not address the Parties’ further
arguments regarding the admissibility of Claimant’s claim for specific

commitments.
400. The Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and Articles 1 and 7 of the BIT to decide the merits of the dispute. It

further finds that Claimant’s claim for breach of specific undertakings is

inadmissible.

VI. LIABILITY.-

A. Applicable Law.-

401. Article 42 of the ICSID Convention provides in its relevant part:

97

“(1) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of
law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the
Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute
(including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international

law as may be applicable.”

402. The BIT does not contain any specific provision regarding the applicable law to

the dispute.

B.  Analysis.-

1. Expropriation -

403. Article 5(2) of the BIT provides:
“The Contracting Parties shall not make any measures of expropriation
or nationalization or any other measure that has the effect of

disposs

 

‘sing, directly or indirectly, the nationals and companies of the
other Contracting Party of their investments, on their territory and on
their maritime area, save for a public purpose and on the condition that
such measures not be discriminatory or contrary to a_ specific

commitment.

Any measures of dispossession that could be taken have to result in the
payment of a prompt and adequate compensation, an amount equal to the
real value of the concerned investments, which shall be valued in relation

to anormal economical situation, prior to any threat of dispossession.

This compensation, its amount and payment methods are established on
the date of dispossession at the latest. This compensation shall be
effectively encashable, paid without delay and freely transferable. It shall
produce, until the date of payment, interest calculated according to the

appropriate market rates.”

98

404. As established above the dispute in this arbitration arises from an investment
comprised of the July 1, 2008 Agreement, the subsequent agreements with

individual customs offices and the Lease Agreement.

405. The July 1, 2008 Agreement formalised the results of the Tender. According to
Decision No. 172, the “General characteristics of the object of the contest”
included:

“1.1 identification of participants in creation of a network of duty-free
stores at state border crossing stations (legal persons of the Republic of
Moldova, except for provided for in the legislation in force), except public
administration authorities, state-owned and municipal companies,

institutions funded from the budget of state or local budgets.

1.2 Construction of one duty-free store in each of the state border
crossing stations: Costesti-Stinca customs stations; Cahul-Oancea
customs stations, Leuseni-Albita customs station; Sculeni customs station;

Ungheni-Cristesti customs station...”'**

406. The July 1, 2008 Agreement established in its “Whereas” No. 3 and 4 that:
“3....the investor was authorised with the right to build and manage the
duty-free store network at the following pre-established state border
crossing points: the Costesti-Stinca, Cahul-Oancea, Lesueni-Albita,

Sculeni, Ungheni-Cristesti customs station;

“4. The Authority grants, as it is foreseen in p.1.1, to the Investor the
exclusive right to manage and administrate the duty-free store network on
the pre-established territories, at the exclusive managerial risk of the
Investor, according to the provisions of this Agreement. The parties
acknowledge that the creation and operation of this store network shall
need a substantial investment from the part of the Investor in order to
assure the realization of business plan provisions accepted by the
organization commission...”

'S4 See Decision No. 172 on the creation of a network of duty free stores at state border crossing stations,
dated February 18, 2008, Exhibit C-8 to Request for Arbitration.

99

407. Clause 2.1 of the July 1, 2008 Agreement stipulates that:
“The objectives of this Agreement consist in granting to the investor the
right to create, operate and administrate the duty- free store network at
the state border crossing points within the entire term this Agreement,
aiming at the same time at the realization of these goals in the most
appropriate, efficient, reasonable and quick manner adaptable to the

customers’ needs.”

408. And Clause 4 provides that:
“4.1 Under this Agreement, the Authority grants to the Investor that
accepts according to the provisions of this Agreement an exclusive right
as it is defined in the p.1.1 to create and manage the duty-free stores

within the area of activity;

4.2 Granting this right, the Authority assures as its integral and
compulsory part, the possibility to use without impediments the area

necessary to create and serve the duty-free store network;

4.3 The authority shall not conclude any agreement of any nature with
third parties that could affect substantially and negatively those rights

granted to or obligations imposed to the Investor.”

409. Clause | (“p.1.1” as referred to in Clause 4 of the Agreement) of the July 1, 2008
Agreement defines “Exclusive rights” in the following manner: “exclusive right
of the Investor to manage and administrate the duty-free store network at the
state border crossing points is established by the Government Decision no. 172
of 18 February 2008 at the exclusive managerial risk of the Investor according
to the provisions of this Agreement. The exclusive rights of the Investor shall not
be opposable any longer to the Authority when, following the organization,
according to the legislation, of a public tender, a third party shall obtain the

right to build and open duty-free-stores at the state border crossing points.”

410. Clause 6 of the Agreement provides that:

100

All.

412.

413.

“6.1 According to the provisions foreseen in the clause 3, the present
Agreement is concluded for a term of 15 (fifteen) years and shall become

effective from the date of its signing.

6.2 The Agreement shall be automatically ceased upon expiration of the
term foreseen in p.6.1 except for:
6.1.1 it is terminated according to its provisions; or

6.1.2 it is renewed according to the provisions of the clause 6.2.

6.2 The Agreement term can be extended with the written consent of the
parties. The Investor has the priority right to extend the Agreement term
or to conclude a new one if he duly fulfilled his obligations undertook
under the previous agreement. This clause does not operate if the
conditions of the new Agreement are essentially different from those of

this Agreement.”

Finally, Clause 19.1 of the Agreement states that: “Jn order to locate the duty-
free stores at the state border crossing points, the Investor shall conclude
agreements of location with each customs office in which area the state border
crossing points exist foreseen in the Government Decision no. 172 of 18

February 200(8)...”

And Clause 7.2 provides that: “According to the provisions of the business plan,
the parties agreed on the need to consider the possibility of granting the right to
open a duty free store to the Investor at the Chisinau International Airport and
at the Giurgiulesti state border crossing point in the conditions foreseen by the

effective law.”

The Lease Agreement provides in its Clause 1.1 that: “The Landholder
undertakes to provide to the Tenant for temporary use the premises indicated in
p.1.2 of this Agreement, and the Tenant undertakes to pay the rent in the amount

and the terms indicated in the p.2 of this Agreement.”

101

414. Clause 1.5 states that: “The respective premises shall be used in order to locate
the duty-free store.” Clause 1.6 provides: “The Agreem(e)nt is concluded for a
period till 31 December 2015.” And Clause 1.7 reads: “The Tenant has the

preferential right to extend the agreement for a new term.”

415. The Tribunal has carefully considered the Parties’ positions. As established
above, the July 1, 2008 Agreement (as well as the Tender) and the Lease
Agreement have been annulled by the Moldovan judiciary. It is significant that
Claimant does not allege that there is any flaw in Moldovan law or that it is
unfair in any way per se. Claimant’s position in essence is rather that the actual
misapplication of Moldovan law by the courts amounts to expropriation.'** As
established above, these agreements have been declared invalid under Moldovan
law by the whole of the Moldovan judicial system, including the Supreme Court.
The Tribunal is not persuaded that there has been collusion between the courts
and the investor’s competitors in the proceedings before the Moldovan courts
over these agreements or that the Moldovan courts have acted in denial of justice
in any way (see Section VI.B.2). Moreover, there is no evidence in the record
that persuades the Tribunal to conclude that the Moldovan judiciary has not
applied Moldovan law legitimately and in good faith in the proceedings

commenced by Claimant’s competitors.

416.

a

Le Bridge has had a fair opportunity to defend its position under Moldovan law
before the Moldovan courts. This Tribunal is not a court of appeal of last resort.
There is no compelling reason that would justify a new legal analysis by this
Tribunal regarding the invalidity of these agreements which has already been
repeatedly, consistently and irrevocably decided by the whole of the Moldovan

judicial system.

417.

x

In light of the fact that the agreements have been found to be invalid under

Moldovan law this Tribunal is not persuaded that there can be deprivation of

156

invalid rights.” The invalidity of these agreements (and hence of the rights

55 See Claimant’s Reply, para. 467 in fine.
‘5 See Newcombe, A., Paradell, L., Law and Practice of Investment Treaties. Standards of Treatment,
Kluwer Law International, 2009, p. 351: “Where the investment in question is a contract governed by host

102

recognised under these agreements, including the purported exclusivity right
under the July 1, 2008 Agreement) resulting from the application of Moldovan
law by the Moldovan courts as a result of lawsuits filed by private competitors
cannot be interpreted as an expropriation of Mr. Arif’s rights, as Claimant
pretends. No wrongful taking results from the legitimate application of
Moldova’s legal system (which the Tribunal notes has not changed since the
time the investment was made) and the subsequent invalidity of the rights at

157
stake.

418. Moreover, with regard to the border stores, they continue to operate and generate
considerable revenues to the investor. Claimant has even opened several more
stores.'** Claimant alleges that the fact that the local lease agreements are still in

59

force and the border stores are still operating’ is irrelevant for Claimant’s

expropriation claim, because Claimant has irrevocably lost the right to operate

his border stores'®

and he is only able to operate them based on a mere
technicality (the local lease agreements have not been cancelled yet although this
seems imminent because they are based on the Tender and the July 1, 2008

Agreement, already cancelled).'*!

Although the Tribunal agrees that the situation
of Claimant’s investment at the border stores is subject to significant legal
insecurity, this cannot amount to an expropriation of Claimant’s investment in
the border stores because, for the moment, Claimant has not been deprived of the

use and benefit of his investment.

 

state law and the contract is invalid or otherwise nullified based on the host state law, in principle there
can be no expropriation because there has been a judicial determination that there is no contract to
expropriate. The investor will either have to show that the judicial determination of the contract rights
amounted to a denial of justice or that the law in question cancelling or nullifying the contract was itself
expropriatory.”

*” According to the doctrine: “To the extent that [this] state of the law was transparent and did not violate
minimum standards, an investor will hardly convince a tribunal that the proper application of that law has
led to an expropriation. This position is consistent with the power of the host state to accept and define the
rights acquired by the investor at the time of the investment.” See Dolzer, R., Schreuer, C., Principles of
International Investment Law, Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 105.

Exhibit R-135) the Decision of the Court of Appeal was overturned and the case was referred back to the
first instance courts before which it is pending.

16 This allegedly occurred on November 24, 2010 when the Supreme Court irrevocably cancelled the
Tender results and the July 1, 2008 Agreement.

419. Thirdly, Claimant argues that in any event Respondent is estopped from alleging
that Mr. Arif had an invalid right pursuant to Moldovan law because it was

Moldova itself that granted him this right.'®

The Tribunal cannot accept
Claimant’s argument which would inevitably imply that Moldova can be liable
at an international level for the correct application by the Moldovan courts of

Moldovan law in lawsuits filed by a private competitor.

420. Finally, Claimant alleges that it is a well settled principle of international law
that a State cannot rely on its internal law to invalidate its own obligations.’
This principle is reinforced by Article 5 of the BIT, which expressly provides
that an expropriation by the State cannot be contrary to a specific commitment of
that State towards the investor.’ The Tribunal has already accepted the
invalidity of these rights as declared by the Moldovan judicial system as a result
of the legitimate application of Moldovan law and has found that this invalidity
cannot be interpreted as an expropriation of the investor’s rights, i.e., the
Tribunal has found that there is no possible expropriation of invalid rights.
Therefore, Claimant’s argument that a State cannot rely on its internal law to
invalidate its own obligations is not applicable with respect to Claimant’s claim

for expropriation. It is therefore rejected.

421.

In light of the above, the Tribunal dismisses Claimant’s claim for expropriation.
Because the Tribunal has already found that there is no expropriation in the case
in dispute, there is no need to address Respondent’s allegations that the
substantive protection provided for in Article 5 of the BIT only extends to direct
investments, that Mr. Arif’s deprivation of his investments resulted from the
application of the regulatory power of Moldova or that expropriation by court
decisions requires a finding of a denial of justice, whether procedural or

substantial.

. The party to the legal proceedings before the Moldovan courts was Le Bridge, a
company incorporated under Moldovan law, and not Mr. Arif. In the Tribunal’s
view, this precludes a claim for denial of justice under customary international
law by Mr. Arif, but it does not preclude such claim pursuant to the fair and

equitable treatment obligation included in the France-Moldova BIT.

Denial of Justice under Customary International Law

. Claimant alleges denial of justice as both a breach of the fair and equitable
treatment standard and as an independent breach of customary international law.
Denial of justice on both bases was treated separately by the Parties, although the
decisions of the Moldovan judiciary are also invoked by Claimant in his other

allegations of a breach of fair and equitable treatment argued.

Mr. Arif has explicitly and repeatedly insisted that he meant to submit a claim
for denial of justice as an alternative to his claims for Moldova’s alleged
breaches of its obligations under the BIT. The same allegations of wrongdoing
by the judiciary, which represent the basis for his claim for denial of justice, also

represent the grounds for other — distinct — claims for the violation of the BIT.'®

Claimant argues that the fact that Mr. Arif has not been personally involved in
the national court proceedings is not a prerequisite for his claim for denial of
justice, because the BIT and international law protect him in his “capacity of an

29166

indirect investor since “a denial of justice is a breach of the fair and

equitable treatment standard” .‘

Neither Party has presented case law or doctrinal positions, nor is the Tribunal
aware of any, where a party to an international arbitration claiming denial of
justice is legally distinct from the party in the incriminated local court

proceedings. In Loewen, Mr. Loewen, the shareholder and manager of Loewen

Inc., had made a personal and separate application to the arbitral tribunal under

special circumstances, but Loewen Inc. was also a party to the proceedings. The

application failed for various reasons and the tribunal did not have to elucidate

whether Mr. Loewen would have had standing without Loewen Inc. also being a

party,!

427. As for the distinction between claims for denial of justice and for violation of

investment protection treaties such as BITs or NAFTA, tribunals have chosen
different approaches. In Rumeli, the tribunal found that:

“the violations alleged by Claimants and allegedly constituting a denial

of justice, have also been invoked by the Claimants as constituting a

violation of the fair and equitable treatment principle. The Arbitral

Tribunal considers that these violations are better qualified and dealt

with as issues falling under the fair and equitable treatment standard

which also includes in its generality the standard of denial of justice.

[...]. Consequently, the alleged violations will not be separately dealt

with under the denial of justice standard.”'®

428. Conversely, the tribunal in Loewen clearly distinguished between “an element of
unfair and inequitable treatment or denial of justice amounting to a breach of

17 and confirmed:

international justice
“an intervention on our part would compromise them [the purposes of
NAFTA] by obscuring the crucial separation between the international
obligation of the State under NAFTA, of which the fair treatment of
foreign investors in the judicial sphere is but one aspect, and the much
broader domestic responsibilities of every nation towards litigants of

whatever origin to appear before its national courts. v7

429. In his monograph on Denial of Justice in International Law, Jan Paulsson
consistently distinguishes between the violation of an independent international
obligation and denial of justice: courts may violate an international obligation

when they refuse to comply with a treaty obligation “but it is not a denial of
justice”’”. He argues that the principle of denial of justice neither covers the
responsibility of States for the misapplication of national law by its judiciary, nor
its breaches of international law by procedure or decisions. He insists that the
core of the principle is rather the duty of States “to create and maintain a system
of justice which ensures that unfairness to foreigners either does not happen or
is corrected”'”*. In fact, the major thrust of the monograph is the foundation of
an international delict to protect aliens against a fundamentally unfair

administration of justice in proceedings before courts of a foreign nation.

 

Claimant is not in disagreement with the specificities of the different claims nor

even with the principle of necessity of the denial of justice to a foreigner. He

argues:
“Claimant’s case of expropriation is not about “expropriation by denial of
justice”. Claimant does not need to make a showing that it was denied
justice for its claim of expropriation to prevail. It suffices, for a finding of
unlawful expropriation, that the State deprive Claimant from its investment
(i) without a public purpose, and/or (ii) in a discriminatory manner; and/or
(iii) contrary to a specific commitment, without the need to show that
Respondent denied justice to Claimant. It is if, and only if Claimant had

raised its treaty claims against R dent before local courts, which it

  

has not, and had been denied justice, that it would constitute a denial oj

justice claim. Yet, this is not the case.

o 174

The Tribunal has pondered these arguments. It recalls that the standard of denial
of justice has been developed by international tribunals as an international delict
to protect aliens against acts of the judiciary of a foreign State — as opposed to
“non-judicial branches of government” — which “amount to an outrage, bad

faith, willful neglect of duty, or insufficiency of actions apparent to any unbiased

man”!”. The specific restrictive appraisal of judicial acts was owed to the
“political and international delicacy to disacknowledge the judicial decision of a

court of another country.”'"6

432. This was long before international treaties started to protect investors by
establishing specific and well defined responsibilities of States which can be
violated by any organ of the State, including the judiciary. The standard of denial
of justice was not incorporated into the catalogue of obligations. That is also due

to the fact that treaty obligations

 

such as the promise not to unlawfully
expropriate or to provide fair and equitable treatment are of a contractual nature,

whereas denial of justice has always been characterized as delictual.

433. It is true that many of the terms to describe one or the other sphere of

international rights and obligations (denial of justice or fair and equitable

 

treatment) — such as ‘arbitrariness’, ‘discrimination’ ‘unfairness’ or ‘bias’ — are
used interchangeably. This semantic overlap might contribute to certain
confusion. It does not imply, however, that both standards and principles have
merged into one and that the prerequisites as well as the consequences of a claim
for denial of justice and for the violation of a treaty standard of fair and equitable
treatment have become identical. Both types of claims are based in international
law, there is certainly and inevitably a continuous “cross-pollination”'” between

the two, but they remain distinct and specific.

434,

&

Claims under international investment protection treaties protect foreign
investment against breaches of obligations that States have promised to respect.
Claims for denial of justice protect foreigners against delictual acts of the
judiciary. They engage the State’s responsibility because it has a non-contractual
obligation under international law to provide a system of justice which treats
aliens fairly, honestly and impartially. Whether that is the case or not can only be

tested by the foreigner in court proceedings.

fails does not, however, exonerate the Tribunal from carefully appraising the
alleged facts and deciding whether they amount to a breach of the fair and
equitable treatment standard.

Claimant alleges in his Reply!”

that: “... there is no need for Mr. Arif to have
been denied justice personally, as alleged by Respondent. Rather, it is sufficient
for a denial of justice to have taken place which deprived Mr. Arif of his
investment which, in turn, constitutes a breach by Moldova of its obligation to

accord fair and equitable treatment to Claimant’s investments.”

Conversely to a free-standing claim for denial of justice which can only be
brought by a person that has participated in the national court proceedings, the
standard of fair and equitable treatment also protects the foreign shareholder in a
local company. If the standard is breached by a denial of justice, the State will be
held responsible towards the indirect investor for a breach of fair and equitable

treatment.

International law has evolved in recent decades and the previous conviction as
expressed in the Chattin award that acts of the judiciary had to be judged with
more ‘delicacy’ and circumscription than acts committed by the other branches

of government, is obsolete. The Tribunal shares the modern opinion!” according

to which the State has to be seen as a unity and the acts of any of its organs,

including the judiciary, may violate international law.

Two caveats need to be made, however. The first one was convincingly
formulated by the Loewen tribunal:
“Too great a readiness to step from outside into the domestic arena,
attributing the shape of an international wrong to what is really a local
error (however serious), will damage both the integrity of the domestic

judicial system and the viability of NAFTA itself”.

. Indeed, international tribunals must refrain from playing the role of ultimate

appellate courts. They cannot substitute their own application and interpretation
of national law to the application by national courts. It would blur the necessary
distinction between the hierarchy of instances within the national judiciary and
the role of international tribunals if “/a] simple difference of opinion on the part
of the international tribunal is enough” to allow a finding that a national court
has violated international law.'*! The opinion of an international tribunal that it
has a better understanding of national law than the national court and that the
national court is in error, is not enough. In fact — as Claimant formulated —
arbitral tribunals cannot “put themselves in the shoes of international appellate

courts”.|°

The second caveat concerns the issue of exhaustion of national remedies. The
responsibility of States not to breach the fair and equitable treatment standard
through a denial of justice is engaged if and when the judiciary has rendered
final and binding decisions after fundamentally unfair and biased proceedings or
which misapplied the law in such an egregiously wrong way, that no honest,

competent court could have possibly done so.

As long as such decisions are not final and binding and can be corrected by the

internal mechanisms of appeal, they do not deny justice. In other words, as long

as the judicial system is not tested as a whole, the fair and equitable treatment
standard is not violated via a denial of justice. The State does not mistreat a
foreign investor unfairly and inequitably by a denial of justice through an
appealable decision of a first instance court, but only through the final product of
its administration of justice which the investor cannot escape. The State is not
responsible for the wrongdoings of an individual judge as long as it provides

readily accessible mechanisms which are capable of neutralizing such judge.

444, The Tribunal concurs with Jan de Nul where the tribunal held:
“The Tribunal considers that the respondent State must be put in a position
to redress the wrongdoings of its judiciary.
LJ
The Tribunal cannot concur with the Claimant’s expert that an unjust
judgment of a lower court may per se constitute unfair and inequitable
treatment and, therefore, denial of justice without any prior conditions
being met.
LJ
Thus, the Claimants do not complain of the failure of the Egyptian legal
system as such, but merely of the conduct of the Ismailia Co and its
appointed experts. This is not sufficient to justify a claim for denial of
justice, let it be through the fair and equitable claim, at least when there is
no claim that the appellate proceedings are in any manner

dysfunctional.”"*?

445. The Tribunal holds that the State can be held responsible for an unfair and
inequitable treatment of a foreign indirect investor if and when the judiciary
breached the standard by fundamentally unfair proceedings and outrageously
wrong, final and binding decisions. It will therefore turn to the two sets of court
actions which were each time initiated by local competitors against Le Bridge,
and it will determine whether the judiciary denied Le Bridge justice and thereby

breached the fair and equitable treatment standard to which Mr. Arif is entitled.

Appraisal of court proceedings around the Lease Agreement

Claimant has asserted a procedural denial of justice by alleging that the
Economic Circuit Court, the Economic Court of Appeal and the different
interconnected competitors that brought an action have acted in collusion to
prevent the execution of the valid Lease Agreement and the opening of the
airport shop, by ordering provisional measures, without any legal basis in the
Moldovan Civil Procedure Code. The different applications were made in
connection with an action by the competitors for the invalidation of the Lease

Agreement.

 

The Tribunal has carefully studied the different decisions of the Economic
Circuit Court, the Economic Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court dealing
with the provisional measures. It has come to the conclusion that the Moldovan
judiciary and in particular the Economic Circuit Court have committed

procedural errors, but that these errors do not amount to such a manifest

disrespect of due process that they offend a sense of judicial propriety:

-The delays of the local proceedings'**

through the instances leading to

temporary measures were not excessive. They started in November 2009 to

find their conclusion in a decision of the Supreme Court of 28 April 2011.'*

' See Claimant’s description of the matter in Claimant’s Memorial, paras. 495 and 496: “On
November 10, 2009, the Economic Circuit Court ordered the suspension of the Airport Lease
Agreement pursuant to the application of Dufremol. On May 12, 2010, the Economic Circuit Court
again ordered the suspension of the Airport Lease Agreement pursuant to the application of
Moldclassica. On the very next day, i.e, May 13, 2010, the Economic Court of Appeal quashed the
provisional measure that the Economic Circuit Court had issued in favor of Dufremol on November
10, 2009, that was the same measure as had been granted to Moldclassica the day before. On
September 9, 2010, the Economic Circuit again ordered the exact same provisional measures
suspending the Airport Lease Agreement pursuant to the application of Trivoli-Com. On October 21,
2010, the Economic Court of Appeal quashed the provisional measure ordered by the Economic
Circuit Court on September 9, 2010 in favor of Trivoli-Com. However, at that time the Moldclassica
provisional measure was still in force. It was only on Thursday, November 8, 2010, that the
Economic Court of Appeal quashed the provisional measure that the Economic Circuit Court had
issued in favor of Moldclassica on May 12, 2010, while immediately after the weekend on Monday
November 12, 2010, the Economic Circuit Court again ordered the same provisi¢
suspending the Airport Lease Agreement, this time pursuant to the application of Ghermivali.
Friday December 14, 2010, the Economic Court of Appeal quashed the provisional measure issued
by the Economic Circuit Court on November 12, 2010 in favor of Ghermivali.

Since as of December 14, 2010, there were no longer any provisional measures in place preventing
Le Bridge from opening the Airport store, Le Bridge applied to the Director-General of the Airport
State Enterprise for permission to open, which was withheld — for no apparent reason — until
December 22, 2010. That happened to be the exact same date that — this time — the Economic Court

 

 

 

112

- Le Bridge was at no moment prevented to lodge appeals, to access the
courts and to present its arguments.

-As a system, the judiciary devoted the necessary time to the applications and
gave overall reasoned decisions. It is true that the first decision of the
Economic Circuit Court was extremely short and did barely go beyond the —
correct — quotation of procedural norms on which it was based.'*
Conversely, the handling of the matter by the Economic Court of Appeal was
transparent and reasoned. It first upheld the first instance court’s decision on
the grounds that it was adequate and did not violate interests of Le Bridge,'*’
but then reversed its own decision after an application by Le Bridge, in

recognition of the fact that the suspension of the Lease Agreement “is

vy 188
exaggerated and causes damages”.

The Economic Court of Appeal
consistently acted on these considerations and overturned all further
decisions of the Economic Circuit Court ordering provisional measures. The
latter court in turn took the reasons of the Court of Appeal into account by
asking the plaintiffs/competitors to provide security. When the Economic
Court of Appeal finally ordered a sequester to be put in place, thereby
admitting provisional measures itself, the situation had changed: a first
decision on the merits, annulling the airport Lease Agreement, had been
rendered, and was before it on appeal by Le Bridge. The Supreme Court
finally rejected the cassation appeal against provisional measures by a fully
reasoned majority decision, which was objected to in a dissenting opinion. At
that moment the Economic Court of Appeal had already confirmed the first

instance court’s decision on the merits to invalidate the Lease Agreement.

 

of Appeal granted Dufremol a provisional measure preventing Le Bridge from accessing the Airport
store. It is essential to note that the same Economic Court of Appeal had quashed provisional
measures identical to the one it issued on December, 22, 2010 at four prior occasions, the last one

as recent as December 14,2010, on grounds of violation of Moldovan law.”

448. When appreciating these facts, the sequence of the decisions, the partial success
of Le Bridge’s appeal and the reasons given by the higher instances (including a
dissenting opinion), the Tribunal is not convinced that the judiciary acted in
collusion with outside plaintiffs, that it was guided by a spirit of bias and

partiality and that it was grossly incompetent as a system.

449. The next step is for the Tribunal to determine whether the final and binding
decision on the merits invalidating the Airport Lease Agreement denied Mr. Arif
substantive justice, as asserted by Claimant. It takes the following facts and

arguments into consideration.

450. The Lease Agreement was concluded on 28 July 2008 between Le Bridge and
the Airport State Enterprise. At that time there was no prior approval by SACA
(which chooses the lessee) and no authorization by the SACA to conclude the

contract without a prior tender, i.e. by direct negotiation.

451.

The authorization is intended to guarantee the best and most profitable use of
unused State property. It is specified in the law that the tender should only be
avoided if there are good reasons for it (disproportionately high costs for
instance). Claimant’s expert, Prof. Rosca, testifies therefore, understandably, that
a contract concluded without this authorization is void. Rosca goes on to say that
the authorization was given, but he errs, because he quotes the approval which
was given after the conclusion of the contract.'* This posterior approval exists
indeed. The SACA approved the Lease Agreement on August 5, 2008.'” In
formal legal terms, however, the posterior approval is not equivalent to the prior
authorization as required in the law, a requirement that is not void of economic

sense.

452. A competitor attacked the validity of the contract arguing that it was null and
void because no prior authorization had been given. The Economic Circuit Court

followed this reasoning, explained at length that the contract contradicted

'8° See Expert Report by Dr. Nicolae Rosca, dated 12 February 2012, at para. 123.
' See Letter No. 2124 from the Director-General of the SACA, dated August 5, 2008, Exhibit C-65 to

114

453.

454,

imperative rules of law, that it was null and void in accordance with Article 220
of the Civil Code, and invalidated it. The court argued that the Law on
Administration and Privatization of Public Property and Regulation No. 483
stipulated that, under normal circumstances public assets “can be rented with the
prior agreement of the central or local public authority, which will decide the
mode of selection of the tenant” and that, under specific circumstances, which
the court held did not exist, the authority may accept to rent the unused assets
“through direct negotiations”."”' Upon Le Bridge’s appeal, The Economic Court
of Appeal upheld this decision with a detailed motivation,'” and the Supreme

Court also confirmed the decision.'”*

The decisions are carefully drafted and can be followed in their reasoning from
A to Z. As a matter of general interpretation, they are not fundamentally
different from Claimant’s expert, Prof. Rosca, insofar as they argue that the lack
of a prior approval leads to absolute and irreparable nullity. It is well possible
that courts in jurisdictions with a different legal tradition would have been less
formalistic, that they would have reasoned in a more teleological way, that they
would have tried to remedy the formal defect by economic considerations. All
these arguments are valid in appeal proceedings. They may be better than the
ones used by the Moldovan courts. They do not disqualify, however, the national
courts’ application to such a degree to be so egregiously wrong that no
competent and honest court would use them. This is all the less so, because the
argument in favour of an imperative prior authorization is not void of economic

sense.

The Tribunal finds therefore that the final and binding decision of the judiciary

to invalidate the Lease Agreement does not as such amount to a denial of justice.

Appraisal of court proceedings around the Tender and lease contracts on

the border stores

. Claimant contends that the State treated him unfairly and inequitably by
allowing the judiciary to deny him justice in a variety of ways: by dishonestly
reformulating one technical specification in tender documents; by arrogating
jurisdiction in bad faith; by egregiously violating three fundamental procedural
rules: the mandatory preliminary procedure, the 30-days limitation period and

due process.

The Tribunal notes that the original disputes with respect to the border stores are
not between the State and Le Bridge. On the contrary, the national Tender
Commission and in particular the Moldovan Ministry of Economy took sides
with Le Bridge and indirectly with Claimant, and defended their position as the

winner of the Tender organised by the government.

The dispute was initiated by a competitor who had participated in the Tender and
lost, and who alleged that Le Bridge had won although not fulfilling the
requirements of the Tender specifications. That is a serious matter and

complicated in most jurisdictions.

The original dispute originates from the controversial understanding of one word
in the “Technical Specifications” to conducting a public contest for creation of a
network of duty-free stores at state border crossing stations”. Its paragraph 2.3.

No. 8 requests, in the Moldovan language version, that each participant must

prove an experience of activity “in domeniu’” of at least 5 years.'"* The Russian
version asks for experience in the “given sphere”.'°* The English translation, as

submitted by Claimant, reads “in this field of activity”.'"°

In the original dispute, Le Bridge asserted that the requirement referred to a
general experience in the field of export-import commerce and that it and Mr.
Arif largely met the requirement. Le Bridge was supported in this opinion by the
Ministry of Economy. The competitor asserted that the requirement referred to a
specific experience in the field of duty-free. It was supported in this opinion by

another member of the Tender Commission.

The stakes of the “proper” understanding of the requirement were high, in
particular since only two competitors had participated in the contest. Had it
referred to a general experience in the field, Le Bridge and the competitor would
both have been qualified; had it referred to an experience in the field of duty-

free, only the competitor would have qualified.

The Moldovan courts considered the controversial matter and came to the
conclusion that the wording as well as the economic and political context
favored an interpretation requiring a 5 years’ experience in the field of duty-free.

The Supreme Court gave reasons, which it summarized as follows:

 

“Tt is obvious that it follows from the text, the meaning and the legal
standards regulating such legal relations, that the experience in the
sphere in this case is inseparably related to the final objective, i.e. setting
up a network of duty-free stores; this is why there was an eliminatory
provision for the competitors, such as having a real experience no less
than five years, exactly in the duty-free store market, not in any other
sphere, including related spheres, such as usual commerce or even

. 197
import-export commerce.

Do these decisions document bad faith and a lack of impartiality? The Tribunal
does not think so. It has carefully studied the text in the three languages. It has
found that the Moldovan text is the least precise but, seen in the context of the
other provisions and project description of the Technical Specifications which

argumentation of the Supreme Court. It seems that the English translation, which
was apparently produced in good faith, reflects an identical understanding. In
addition, the Russian text, which has its importance in Moldova although

Russian is not an official language, also seems to orient to the duty-free sector.

463. The Tribunal is not entitled to make a final finding on the question. That would
amount to a revision of the merits and be beyond its competence. The Tribunal
is, however, convinced that the Moldovan courts did not render decisions that no
competent and honest court would have possibly been able to render when they
decided that the Technical Specifications required an experience of 5 years in the

field of duty-free and that therefore Le Bridge did not qualify.

464. The Tribunal is reinforced in this opinion by a further consideration. The present
case is different from other cases presented in these proceedings insofar as in the
other cases the allegedly unjust court decisions had normally led to the
termination of the claimants’ economic activities. In the present case, the
judiciary invalidated the Tender results and the subsequent July 1, 2008
Agreement, but not the lease contracts themselves. Not only do these contracts
remain in force today, but Le Bridge and Claimant have created a network of
duty free shops without a tender and they are apparently profitable even without

exclusivity clauses.

465.

a

Claimant concedes that the Tender was not a prerequisite for the opening of duty

free shops in general, that they could be opened on the ba:
98

 

is of individually
negotiated contracts and that is what Le Bridge did,'°* just like its competitor. In
the face of this uncontested evidence, the Tribunal does not believe that there
was a general animus against Mr. Arif’s and Le Bridge’s business, and that the

judiciary tried to destroy Mr. Arif’s business in Moldova in general.

‘8 Counsel for Respondent stated at the hearing that: “And now Le Bridge itself has been allowed to open
further border stores without a tender, so there's no discrimination there either”, Hearing Transcript, Day
1, p. 167. Counsel for Claimant did not rebut this statement.

118

466. Claimant further contends that the Economic Circuit Court and the Economic
Court of Appeal rendered decisions ultra petita by ascertaining advantages

which were not requested by the competitor.

467. The Tribunal has checked the request before the Economic Circuit Court. The
competitor asked “to declare as illegitimate the land lease agreement made
between the Custom Service of the Republic of Moldova and “Le Bridge

that during the hearing Dufremol requested that this claim regarding the
illegality of the local lease agreements be withdrawn and Dufremol requested
instead that the July 1, 2008 Agreement be declared invalid and that the national
Customs Service was ordered to “revoke the resolutions of acceptance of the

lease agreements”? The Tribunal does not see how ordering the national
Customs Service to withdraw its acceptance of the lease agreements on the

border shops was not claimed, as Claimant alleges.

468. The Tribunal has also considered the decision of the Economic Court of Appeal
that declared the competitor “as the winner of the tender for the setting-up of a

network of “duty-free” stores at the state border crossing points”?”'

, although it
stated before that the plaintiff had only asked for a declaration of illegality of the
Tender results. The court argued that the Tender results had infringed upon the
rights of the competitor and that the competitor had been the only other
participant in the Tender. The Supreme Court reconsidered the matter and found
that the decision of the Economic Court of Appeal did not disadvantage Le
Bridge. It declared that:

“the cassation court is convinced that this is the only way reestablishing

the plaintiff in its rights taking into consideration the fact that there are

no other competitors which are claiming their rights of winners, and the

authority in charge of the tender has not referred to any objections

regarding the plaintiff's incompatibility with the tender requirements. 7202

469. The Tribunal realizes that the competitor did not make a formal request to be
declared the winner of the contest. It did, however, explicitly pursue its action to
push Le Bridge aside and — logically — to take its place. In Le Bridge’s appeal in
cassation, the competitor evidently defended the decision of the Economic Court
of Appeal. The Tribunal believes that the Economic Court of Appeal did decide
ultra petita by substituting a formal request by its logical deduction. That was an
error and remained an error despite the excuses formulated by the Supreme

Court.

470. Is the error tainted by impermissible bias and bad faith? The Tribunal is not
convinced for the following reasons: the court’s decisions had no negative
impact on Le Bridge’s position and business. For Le Bridge, the important part
of the decision was the invalidation of the Tender result declaring it the winner.
The further and unwarranted declaration of another winner did in fact neither
disadvantage Le Bridge nor, indirectly, Mr. Arif. That might have been different
if the status of exclusivity of entitlement on duty-free business had been
maintained. But the State had already invalidated the exclusivity right to open
and operate border shops for reasons of competition law. Moreover, the Tender
results and the July 1, 2008 Agreement had been cancelled, including the alleged

rights to exclusivity. This allowed Le Bridge to continue its operations, side by

 

side with the winning competitor, in its shops at the border crossings which had
been identified in the Tender documents. The erroneous decision of the
Economic Court of Appeal had therefore no effect on Le Bridge. It was wrong,
but not manifestly unjust.

203

471.

The Tribunal notes that Claimant also states in his Memorial” that Moldova’s

judiciary unlawfully issued provisional measures”™ suspending the Tender

202

results, as a result of which Claimant was unable to open his border store at
Costesti for eleven months. Claimant does not elaborate on this statement and
fails to show in what way these provisional measures constituted a denial of

justice. Therefore, the Tribunal rejects this argument.
472. Claimant further asserts that the State violated the fair and equitable treatment
standard by an administration of justice where the judiciary breached

fundamental principles of procedure.

473. The Tribunal has examined the alleged four instances of procedural denial of

justice.

474,

S

The first allegation concerns an arrogation of jurisdiction by the Economic
Circuit Court, where in reality the Court of Appeal was competent in the first
instance, given the administrative nature of the contested acts, i.e. the Decision

205

of the national Tender Commission, the 1 July, 2008 Agreement™” and the lease

contracts concluded with the local customs offices.

475. The Economic Circuit Court argued that it had jurisdiction because the “object of
action does not constitute the violated right or the interest of the state or a
territorial administrative unit, but the violated right of an economic agent, which
relate to the jurisdiction of the Economic Circuit Court”2° Before coming to

this conclusion, it enumerated the possible administrative law matters.

476. Nevertheless, Claimant and Claimant’s experts developed a different

 

argumentation. They argued that the decision of the Tender Commission, the
July 1, 2008 Agreement and the four lease contracts with the local customs
offices had to be qualified as administrative acts and contracts in accordance
with Article 2 of the Law on Administrative Disputes, and that claims contesting

such administrative acts were, in accordance with Article 33(3)(b) of the

Moldovan Code of Civil Procedure, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Appeal.”°” Prof. Belei explained that the Economic Circuit Court

wrongly applied a law which had been abolished in 2011.7°*

477. The Economic Court of Appeal confirmed the first instance decision, insisting on
the fact that the “object of litigation represents the violated right of an economic

agent”2”

478. The Supreme Court, in its final and binding decision confirmed the previous
decisions and stated that the courts,

“faced to a number of connex claims some of which are under

jurisdiction of administrative court, yet some of them are under the

jurisdiction of economic court, guided by imperative law provisions, have

absolutely correctly considered the jurisdiction of economic court in a

justified way.”*"°

479. The Tribunal has studied the different legal provisions. It has learned from Prof.
Belei’s expert report that many of the changes in procedural law and particularly
in administrative law are of very recent origin and new for the Moldovan legal
system. It has also looked at the July 1, 2008 Agreement and the lease contracts
with the local customs offices. It realizes that in both cases one party to the
agreements is a public authority and that the object is the use of public land, as
provided in the definition of Article 2 of the Law on Administrative Disputes.
The Tribunal is, however, equally conscious of the fact that the Agreement and
the lease contracts contain to a large extent provisions which are not alien to
lease contracts under private law. The Tribunal is not sure whether they are “for

the advantage of public power prerogatives”, as stipulated in the same Article 2.

On the other hand, the Tribunal has noticed that Article 29 of the Moldovan
Code of Civil Procedure established jurisdiction of the “economic judiciary
instances” over disputes arising, among others, from land-related relationships
and, under certain circumstances, from administrative acts, necessarily involving

the administration.

In other words, the Tribunal is confronted with a complex question of Moldovan
procedural law which has been answered differently and contradictorily by the
judiciary and by learned experts on Moldovan law. Both interpretations are
based on arguments and on the words and objectives of the law. The Tribunal is
not in a position and has no competence to take sides in this controversy. If it
tried, it would indeed sit as a court of appeal over decisions of the Moldovan

judiciary.

The Tribunal’s role is limited to determine whether the judiciary has denied
justice by applying procedures that are so void of reason that they breathe bad
faith. The Tribunal has not found such type of conduct.

The second allegation of procedural denial of justice concerns the mandatory
preliminary application procedure which, according to Claimant, the competitor
did not respect and which should have been taken into account ex officio by the
judiciary. Claimant submits that the plaintiff/competitor forged such an

application.

 

Respondent has not denied the necessity of a preliminary procedure. It insists,

however, that the plaintiff/competitor provided proof of the application which

was accepted by the courts in good faith.

The Tribunal is not in a position and has no competence to retrace and reappraise
the factual evidence. It notes that the first instance court examined and accepted
the plaintiff’'s/competitor’s letter as application to the Ministry of Economy for a
preliminary procedure, that the Court of Appeal examined and confirmed the

ruling and held that the existence of the letter was prima facie evidence that

123

2u

respondent had to invalidate," and that the Supreme Court “does not agree that
no pertinent evidence of failure to receive such preliminary applications was

presented.”?'*
486. The Tribunal does not find a violation of fundamental principles of procedure in
the courts’ handling of the letter and dismisses the contention of a procedural

denial of justice.

487.

x

Claimant alleges a third fundamental violation of due process and submits that
the courts did not take into consideration that the plaintiff/competitor had not
respected the mandatory limitation period of 30 days within which a claim must

be brought and had not provided any justification for this.

488. The Tribunal has studied Article 17 of the Law on Administrative Disputes. The
normal deadline for a claim is 30 days. It starts to run when the applicant is
informed of the act. The Supreme Court found:

“The applications for taking part in the tender were collected and kept
confidentially by the authority in charge of the tender. The Panel does not
find any plausible evidence that the plaintiff-appellee had free access to
other competitors’ applications, in order to oppose his right of

to the l defe 's partici

in the public

tender.”?>

489. The Supreme Court deducted from this statement of fact that the first instance
and the appellate courts had correctly decided to accept the late claim. The
Tribunal is not in a position and has no competence to retrace and reappraise the
facts. In these circumstances it cannot find an egregious misapplication of

procedural law and a procedure which is tainted by bad faith.

493.

The fourth and last contention of procedural denial of justice concerns an alleged
violation of due process. It is uncontested that the plaintiff/competitor orally
amended its claim during a hearing on the merits before the Economic Circuit
Court and submitted the amendment in hand-written form. The court accepted
the amendment without handing a copy of the hand-written document to Le
Bridge. Claimant’s expert expressed that it was fundamentally unfair that the
copy was not given to Le Bridge because it was “prevented from making

we . / . en oy 214
submissions on the issue and from formulating objections thereto”.

Both the Economic Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court validated the
decision of the first instance court. The Supreme Court stated:
“The panel considers that the representatives of the appellants were
present during the examination of the case by the lower courts, they were
heard on factual and legal issues, the principles of due-process were
respected and the representative of the appealing party, F.C.E. Le Bridge
Corporation Limited L.L.C. had the possibility respond and give evidence

against the arguments of the opponent party. vals

The Tribunal has studied the amendment of the claim and the subsequent
procedure. The plaintiff/competitor had initially requested to annul the four
border store lease contracts with the local customs offices. He withdrew this
request (only to introduce it later in a separate lawsuit) and replaced it by the
request “to acknowledge as illegal the Agreement concluded between “Le

Bridge” company and Custom Service” 2'6

The Tribunal has noted that Le Bridge reacted immediately, as documented by
the Economic Circuit Court. The court stated — and that is not contested - :
“The representative of the defendant, the Company “Le Bridge
Corporation Limited”, during the hearing stated that, given the fact that

the plaintiff modified its initial requests, the claim of the plaintiff

24 See Expert Report by Dr. Elena Belei, dated 12 February 2012, Annex 9 to Claimant’s Memorial at

a

x

regarding the declaration as illegal of the lease agreements concluded
according to the results of the tender, have to be removed from the

Docket.”?"7

The quotation documents that Le Bridge was fully aware of the amendment of
the claim, did not object to it and drew the consequences which it found
appropriate. The court decision demonstrates that it took Le Bridge’s request into
account. In fact, it was this amended claim at the exclusion of the initial request
for an invalidation of the lease contracts that was carried through the instances.
Le Bridge had at each step and from the very formulation of the amendment an

opportunity to comment it, and it did.

The Tribunal deducts from these circumstances that the party’s right to be heard
was respected during the national court proceedings and that the oral amendment
of the claim and its subsequent submission in hand-written form, however

peculiar they may seem, have not violated due process.

Finally, with regard to Claimant’s further argument that a violation of due
process also occurred when the Supreme Court of Justice, in its decision of
November 24, 2010, refused to admit Le Bridge’s appeal on cassation, thereby
refusing to hear the appeal, but nevertheless proceeded to examine the substance
of the matter and elaborate on it, the Tribunal notes that the reasoning of the
Supreme Court was sufficiently detailed and gave a grounded basis for rejecting
Le Bridge’s appeal. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal finds no breach of

due process.

In conclusion, the Tribunal dismisses the claim for procedural and substantive
denial of justice during the court proceedings around the Decision of the Tender

Commission and the July 1, 2008 Agreement.

See Decision of the Economic Circuit Court, dated 28 May 2010, Exhibit C-150 to Claimant’s

Memorial, at page 2.

3. Specific Undertakings.-

498. The Tribunal has already found in Section V that Claimant’s claim for specific

undertakings is inadmissible and therefore there is no need to address the merits

of this claim.

4. Unreasonable or arbitrary measures.-

499. Claimant argues that this standard does not differ from the FET standard and

500.

50

that, to this extent, all the acts and omissions alleged to have breached the FET
standard are also in breach of Respondent’s obligation not to impose
unreasonable or arbitrary measures. Alternatively, and in case the Tribunal
should consider this as a standard independent of the FET standard, Claimant
argues that this obligation is brought in via the MFN clause in Article 4 of the

BIT2!8

Firstly, the Tribunal notes that there is no independent obligation not to impose
arbitrary or unreasonable measures under the BIT. Even though non-arbitrariness

d as one of the el of the FET dard a breach of FET

may be cc
does not necessarily imply the existence of arbitrariness. Claimant’s general
argument that all the acts and omissions alleged to have breached the FET
standard also are in breach of Respondent’s obligation not to impose
unreasonable or arbitrary measures is rejected. Claimant has to successfully
prove how the alleged acts and omissions are in breach of Respondent’s alleged

obligation not to impose arbitrary or unreasonable measures.

. Secondly, the Tribunal notes Claimant’s definition of an “arbitrary measure”, as

 

established in his Memorial: “...“not so much something opposed to a rule of
law, as something opposed to the rule of law [...] It is a wilful disregard of due
process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial
propriety.” An act is arbitrary because it is “not founded on reason or fact [...]

p p ( oss 219
but on mere fear reflecting national preference.

718 See Claimant’s Reply, para. 583.
21° See Claimant’s Memorial, para. 393.

127

502. Claimant has not successfully proved before this Tribunal in what way each of
the alleged acts and omissions of Respondent would amount to a breach of
Respondent’s alleged obligation not to impose unreasonable or arbitrary

2
measures.””°

503. For the reasons stated above, and irrespective of whether this obligation can be

imported via the MFN clause, this claim is rejected by the Tribunal.
5. Full Protection and Security.-

504. Article 5(1) of the BIT provides that: “Jnvestments made by the nationals or
companies of one of the Contracting Parties shall enjoy, in the territory and in

the maritime area of the other Contracting Party, full protection and security.”

505. The Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimant’s argument that if a State breaches
the FET standard, it is ipso facto also in breach of the FPS standard. The
standard of FPS is clearly addressed in a separate article in the BIT. The
Tribunal therefore finds that FPS is a separate and independent standard to that
of FET. By the same token, Claimant’s general argument that all of Moldova’s
acts and omissions in breach of FET also constitute breaches of Moldova’s
obligation to grant FPS is rejected. Claimant has to prove how the alleged acts

and omissions are in breach of Respondent’s alleged obligation to grant FPS.

506. Claimant has not successfully proved before this Tribunal in what way each of
the alleged acts and omissions are in breach of Respondent’s full protection and
security obligation, and therefore this claim is rejected. The Tribunal need not

address the further arguments made by the Parties regarding this question.
6. Discrimination.-

507. The Tribunal notes that there is no independent obligation not to discriminate
under the BIT. Claimant’s argument that there was such a breach would only

make sense if this obligation were analysed in the context of national treatment

9 Claimant just argues that this standard does not differ from the FET and that to this extent all the acts
and omissions alleged to have breached the FET standard also are in breach of Respondent’s obligation
not to impose unreasonable or arbitrary measures.

128

(Article 4 of the BIT) or if an independent obligation not to discriminate could

be imported via the MFN clause.”

508.

%

Article 4 of the BIT provides in its relevant part that: “Each Contracting Party
shall extend, in its territory and in its maritime area, to nationals and companies
of the other Contracting Party, regarding their investments and activities
connected with these investments, treatment not less favourable than that

granted to its nationals or companies...”

509. Discrimination is an essential element of a “national treatment” clause, such as
that contained in Article 4 of the BIT. Discriminatory measures towards the
foreign investor in relation to more favourable treatment awarded to national
investors will imply a breach of the national treatment standard. Claimant has to
prove how the alleged acts and omissions are in breach of Respondent’s
obligation not to discriminate in order for the Tribunal to find a breach of

national treatment for discrimination.

51

So

. Claimant indeed tries to prove discrimination based on certain facts.
Nevertheless, the Tribunal is not persuaded that there has been discrimination

against Claimant for the reasons stated below.

51

. With regard to the cancellation of the Lease Agreement, the Tribunal has already
found that it was the result of the application by the Moldovan courts of
Moldovan law, under which the Lease Agreement was invalid. The legitimate
application of Moldovan law cannot be considered discriminatory against

Claimant and Claimant’s argument to the contrary is rejected by this Tribunal.

51

Nv

. With regard to Dufremol’s authorization to open border duty free stores without
a tender, the Tribunal notes that both Parties agree that, under Moldovan law,

such authorization may be granted.” In fact, it seems that Le Bridge has been

22! The Tribunal notes that Claimant alleges discrimination of the investor only with regard to Moldovan
investors.
2 See *s Counter-Memorial, para. 647 and Rejoinder, para. 342. During the
Hearing Professor Knieper asked counsel for Claimant the following: “.../ asked whether you still agree
that these lease agreements at the border can be concluded without any tender or without any other

 

 

 

129

granted the authorization for the opening of several border stores without a
tender? The Tribunal further notes that the local customs office of Leuseni
signed the lease agreement with Dufremol on December 2010°™ and the local
customs office of Cahul signed the lease agreement with Dufremol on January
2011," both dates being posterior to the irrevocable cancellation by the
Supreme Court of both the July 1, 2008 Agreement and the Tender results
(November 24, 2010). The Tribunal finds no discrimination against Claimant in

these circumstances.

513. With respect to Dufremol and Le Bridge’s respective locations at Leuseni and
Cahul, based on the aerial photographs submitted by Respondent as Exhibits R-
102 to R-103, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the locations granted to
Dufremol are better than those granted to Le Bridge. Moreover, the Tribunal
notes that Claimant does not contest Respondent’s argument that Le Bridge
selected its locations at both border crossing points because at that time it
considered they were the best locations. Further, regarding the fence erected in
front of Le Bridge’s border store in Leuseni, Claimant has not proved that there
were no legitimate reasons for this measure or that the Dufremol shop was
similarly positioned as Le Bridge’s shop, which would have justified the erection
of a fence in front of it too.”° Finally, Claimant alleges in his Memorial””’ that
Respondent prevented customers from shopping at Le Bridge’s duty free store in

228

Cahul. The Tribunal is not persuaded, based on the evidence,” that the isolated

incident alleged by Claimant by which a customer “asked to be served quickly

 

formality...” to which counsel for Claimant answered that: “...Now, on the question of the validity of lease
‘agreements, absent a tender, we believe today that it is possible...”, Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 213 and

 

215.

3 Counsel for Respondent stated at the Hearing that: “And now Le Bridge itself has been allowed to open
further border stores without a tender, so there's no discrimination there either”, Hearing Transcript, Day
1, p. 167. Counsel for Claimant did not rebut this statement.

24 See Agency for Land Resources and Cadastre, Hincesti Territorial Cadastral Office, Extract from the

Register of real estate for performing transactions for Le Bridge / Cahul, dated May 24, 2011 Exhibit C-

6 The Tribunal notes that Claimant has not rebutted either in its Reply or at the Hearing Respondent's
argument that the erection of the fence was necessary in order to prevent illegal sales at the frontier with
Romania.

27 See Claimant’s Memorial, para. 280.

because a customs officer had not allowed her to stop in front of Le Bridge’s
store” and that “She also requested that her purchase not be put in a Le Bridge
branded bag to avoid problems with the Customs Officers”, can be considered
discriminatory per se or amount to a breach of Respondent’s obligation not to

discriminate.”

Because this Tribunal finds no discrimination on the basis of the above facts,
Claimant’s claim for discrimination is rejected and there is no need to address
Claimant’s argument that the obligation not to impose discriminatory measures

is imported through the MFN clause.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that even though discrimination may also be
considered an element of FET, the actions and omissions in breach of FET will
not necessarily imply a breach with respect to non-discrimination. Therefore,
Claimant’s general argument that all of Moldova’s acts and omissions in breach
of FET also constitute breaches of Moldova’s obligation not to discriminate is
dismissed. Claimant has to prove that each of the alleged acts and omissions
were in breach of Respondent’s obligation not to discriminate in order for the

Tribunal to find such breach. Claimant has not satisfied his burden of proof.

7. | Compensation.-

516.

517.

Claimant alleges that Respondent’s non-payment of compensation for the
expropriation of his investment constitutes a further breach of its obligations

under the BIT and international law.?*°

 

The Tribunal has already found in Section VI.B.1 above that there was no
expropriation of Claimant’s investment. Therefore, Claimant’s claim for

compensation for an expropriation is dismissed.

° The Tribunal further notes that this allegation is not pursued by Claimant either in Claimant’s Reply or
at the Hearing.

treatment obligation has already been considered. This section considers all other

arguments raised in relation to fair and equitable treatment.

encompassed by the fair and equitable treatment standard; namely: (i) that the
State must act consistently vis-a-vis the investor and cannot modify the legal
framework when specific commitments have been made; (ii) the State’s conduct

transparent manner; (iv) the State must act in good faith; and (v) the State’s
conduct cannot be arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, discriminatory,

or lacking in due process.

Claimant alleges specific breaches of the FET standard through inconsistency
“as Moldova’s organs did not act as part of the same unit, but in opposite
ways”;? through “breach of Claimant's legitimate expectations that Moldova

would honor its specific commitments undertaken towards Mr. Arif”; through

the delay in opening stores caused by fire inspection authorities when Le Bridge
had already complied with all applicable fire safety regulations; through the
suspension by the NACP of the July 1, 2008 Agreement’s exclusivity clause;
through the lease agreements entered into by the customs offices with Dufremol,
and in the better locations granted by Dufremol for its stores; and through

harassment and intimidation.”

522. Claimant also argues that the invalidity of rights under domestic law, if they
created expectations on the part of the investor, cannot be invoked against

238

Claimant to allege that his expectations were not legitimate.~” He states that the

legality of the Airport Lease Agreement is irrelevant for the purposes of his

legitimate expectations”?

523. In summary, Claimant alleges a breach of the fair and equitable treatment
standard through treatment that, in multiple forms, was inconsistent, in breach of
legitimate expectations and not in good faith. These concepts are closely inter-
related and overlapping, and are to a large extent different expressions of the

same idea. They are considered together by the Tribunal.

524. Respondent contends with respect to fair and equitable treatment that Claimant
could not legitimately expect that he could acquire rights in violation of local
law, or legitimately expect that local authorities and courts would not apply local
law. Respondent states that it is incontrovertible that investors must make their
investment in compliance with local legislation. Claimant had an obligation to
learn and comply with local law. Respondent states that Claimant does not
explain why he had a legitimate expectation that he could ignore local law by
signing the Lease Agreement. Further, the Tender gave him no right to expect
that he would obtain the Lease Agreement, and the alleged legitimate
expectations regarding access to the airport store or the disciplinary proceedings

against Judge Namasco are without substance.*“”

525. As regards the border stores, Respondent states that Claimant’s arguments are
flawed because contractual commitments are not the type of specific assurances
that can create legitimate expectations for an investor. Further, in relation to
Ungheni, Respondent argues that in fact it did offer exactly the location that
Claimant had expected to have since the Tender began. Respondent also argues
that Claimant does not identify any specific assurance that he would not be
subject to fire safety regulations, or (in respect of the exclusivity clause) any
basis that he could legitimately expect to be exempt from Moldovan competition
law, or any basis for a legitimate expectation that competitors would not receive
better border locations. In any event, Claimant has not demonstrated that

competitors in fact received better locations.

b) Article 3 of the France-Moldova BIT

526. The FET obligation appears in Article 3 of the BIT and reads as follows:

“Fair and equitable treatment

Each Contracting Party binds itself to ensure, on its territory and
maritime zone, in accordance with Public International Law principles,
fair and equitabl. to the ii s of the i and
companies of the other Contracting Party, and to guarantee that the
exercise of the recognized right to fair and equitable treatment will not be
impaired either by statute or de facto. Particularly, although not
exclusively, are considered as statutory or de facto obstacles to fair and
equitable treatment any restriction to the purchase or the transportation
of raw materials and of auxiliary materials, or energy and fuel, as well as
means of production and exploitation of any kind, any obstacles to the
sale and transportation of the products within the state and abroad, as

well as any other measure having similar effects.
The Contracting Parties shall consider in good faith, in accordance with
their internal legislation, the requests for entry and authorization to

reside, employment and travel, made by the nationals of a Contracting

527.

528.

529.

530.

242

Party, pursuant to any investment made in the territory or the maritime

area of the other Contracting Party.”

The content of the fair and equitable treatment obligation is well known through
elaboration in many awards and doctrinal writings, but must still be interpreted
in each treaty in accordance with Articles 31 to 33 of the Vienna Convention on

the Law of Treaties.

The objects and purposes of the France-Moldova BIT, as expressed in its
Preamble, include “to create favourable conditions for French investments in
Moldova and Moldovan investments in France” as well as to encourage and

protect such investments.

The specific language adopted by France and Moldova in Article 3 connects fair
and equitable treatment with ‘public international law principles’, although
neither party has raised the question of whether this language limits the fair and
equitable treatment standard to the minimum standard of treatment of aliens in
customary international law. This question, except in some very specific contexts
such as Article 1.105 of NAFTA, is increasingly of historic significance as the
rapidly expanding practice on FET clauses in treaties accelerates the
development of customary international law.” In any event, the Tribunal is
satisfied that the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 3 of the France-
Moldova BIT is an autonomous standard given: the title of Article 3; the use of
the expression ‘fair and equitable treatment’ three times in Article 3; the
elaboration of a series of non-exclusive obstacles to fair and equitable treatment

in Article 3, as well as the object and purpose of the BIT already referred to.

Article 3 also expressly connects fair and equitable treatment with good faith at
least in the context of the employment and movement of nationals of the other
State party. The non-exclusive elaboration of obstacles to fair and equitable
treatment are of a logistical and regulatory nature showing that measures of this

nature were expressly contemplated as breaching the standard. The reference to

University Press, 2008) page 128.

532.

533.

‘obstacles’ confirms that the fair and equitable treatment obligation relates less
to proactively stimulating the inflow of investment than to ensure that
investment does not suffer unjustified obstruction. Indeed, the fair and equitable
treatment standard has been connected with the concept of a ‘hospitable climate’

for investment.

The Content of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Obligation: Legitimate
Expectations

The express undertaking by a State to ensure that an investment receives fair and
equitable treatment, and the link of this undertaking to a hospitable investment
climate and good faith, provides the foundation on which the State, by its
representations or conduct, or even by inactivity, might encourage certain
expectations in investors before the investments are made as to their future

treatment or of regulatory or administrative action.

Where these expectations have an objective basis, and are not fanciful or the
result of misplaced optimism, then they are described as ‘legitimate
expectations’. “Their expectations, in order to be protected, must rise to the level

of legitimacy and reasonableness in light of the circumstances” 2°“

 

Legitimate expectations as a basis for the analysis of whether a State has failed
to accord an investment fair and equitable treatment are now an established
feature of investment arbitration, but remain problematic. They are susceptible to
a certain easy circularity of argument; investors normally have expectations in
relation to a wide range of contingencies, great and small, and it is often
relatively easy for a claimant to postulate an expectation to condemn the very
conduct that it complains of in the case before it. An example from the current
case is Claimant’s assertion that the delay of two months leading up to the
opening of three border duty free stores by reason of additional requirements of

the fire inspection authorities breached Claimant’s legitimate expectations,

28 See Pope and Talbot, Inc v. Government of Canada, Award on the Merits, Phase 2, paragraph 116;

Saluka
*4 See

Investment B.V. v. The Czech Republic Partial Award dated March 17, 2006, para. 286.

536.

without initially articulating what those legitimate expectations exactly were, and

how they had arisen.”

Another problem is that a single expectation might be expressed at multiple
levels of generality. The multiplication of legitimate expectations may create a
‘moving target’ for a respondent that in an extreme case might raise issues of due

process.

Accordingly, a claim based on legitimate expectations must proceed from the
exact identification of the origin of the expectation alleged, so that its scope can

be formulated with precision.

Further, a breach of an investor’s legitimate expectations does not ipso facto
amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation. Quite simply,
not every expectation of an investor is protected; rather it must be an expectation
recognised and protected in international law. Some expectations may simply be
too minor for this end. Expectations may relate to matters that the investor has
expressly or impliedly agreed will be subject to determination by a State organ,
and therefore exist on the domestic but not the international plane. An investor
might well consider that it has a legitimate expectation that a State will comply
with all its obligations under an investment contract, but if the investor has also
agreed that compliance with the investment contract is subject to the law of the
State party and the jurisdiction of the courts of the State party, then in the
absence of aggravating factors, such

an element of puissance publique or
non-performance is outside the scope of the

fair and equitable treatment standard.

24 See Claimant’s Memorial, para. 456. In his Reply (paragraph 572) Claimant identifies the applicable
legitimate expectation as ‘to open his stores, upon receipt of all necessary certificates’.

24 See Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3 at para. 260 (“In

537. The fair and equitable treatment standard also involves a balancing exercise that
might take into account “the host State’s legitimate right subsequently to
regulate domestic matters in the public interest.” **" However, even where the
State action has a reasonable basis in public policy, the fair and equitable
treatment standard still requires that the State respect the legitimate expectations
insofar as the investor should be treated with an appropriate degree of due
process and, if possible, the State should seek to ameliorate the effects of the

change of policy on the investor.

538.

oe

Accordingly, an investor’s legitimate expectations might be breached not only
by a substantive change in policy, but also by the treatment of the investor
during the process of the change of policy. It has been said that an investor’s
legitimate expectations should be treated with transparency, free from ambiguity,
consistently, and within a framework of a proper exercise of powers.“*
Consistency by the State in its relations with the investor is an important element
of the fair and equitable treatment standard, whether viewed independently or
within the context of legitimate expectations. For example, in MTD Equity Sdn
Bhd v. Republic of Chile, the inconsistent treatment of an investment by two
arms of the government of Chile, where the Foreign Investment Commission
approved an investment that was contrary to the urban policy of the government,
was found to be a breach of the obligation to treat an investor fairly and

equitably.”

539.

So

Finally, the relationship between legitimate expectations and domestic law is
important in this case. The Tribunal has already noted that certain expectations,
such as those arising pursuant to a contract, are properly dealt with in domestic
law and do not amount to expectations protected at the international level.
Conversely, the acts of an organ or official, for which the State is responsible in
international law, might create legitimate expectations on the international plane,
even though the official or organ has acted legally in domestic law. The

international responsibility of a State is not determined by the legality of an act

*7 See Saluka Investments B.V. v. The Czech Republic, at para. 305.
48 See Técnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States (2004) 43 ILM 133.
249 See MTD Equity Sdn v. Republic of Chile (2005) 44 ILM 91.

138

under domestic law, but by the principle of attribution in international law. As

explained by the Tribunal in SPP v Arab Republic of Egypt:?*°
“Whether legal under Egyptian law or not, the acts in question were the
acts of Egyptian authorities, including the highest executive authority of
the Government. These acts, which are now alleged to have been in
violation of the Egyptian municipal legal system, created expectations
protected by established principles of international law. A determination
that these acts are null and void under municipal law would not resolve
the ultimate question of liability for damages suffered by the victim who

relied on the acts.

The principle of international law which the Tribunal is bound to apply is
that which establishes the international responsibility of States when
unauthorized or ultra vires acts of officials have been performed by State
agents under cover of their official character. If such unauthorized or
ultra vires acts could not be ascribed to the State, all State responsibility

would be rendered illusory.”

d) The Airport Shop

540. The object of the Lease Agreement was to lease certain premises at Chisinau
Airport for the purposes of a duty free shop (Article 1 of the Lease Agreement).
The Lease Agreement was subject to the approval of the SACA of the Republic
of Moldova and the premises were not to be transmitted to the investor until this
approval was given (Articles 3.1 and 8.1). The Lease Agreement was approved
by the SACA on August 5, 2008, was further approved by the Board of Directors
of the Airport State Enterprise on August 13, 2008 in Minutes N° 9, and the
licence of Le Bridge to operate duty free stores issued by the Licensing Chamber

of the Government of Moldova was updated to include the airport.

*°° See Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, \CSID Case ARB/84/3,
Award of May 20, 1992, para. 83 and 85.

139

S541.

542.

543.

544.

545.

Accordingly, there was a contract entered into by a state entity, approval of the
contract by a regulatory authority, and an updated licence. The Tribunal
considers that Claimant invested in good faith on the basis of these acts of organs
of the Moldovan State. In these circumstances the Tribunal finds that Claimant
had a legitimate expectation, created by Respondent, that there was a secure
legal framework to operate a duty free store in his leased premises in Chisinau
Airport. Further, Claimant made his investment in the duty free shop at Chisinau

Airport in reliance on this legitimate expectation.

This legitimate expectation strengthened over time as Le Bridge made its
investment in the preparation of the Airport shop with the knowledge and
consent of the Airport State Enterprise and other organs of the State. Le Bridge
and Claimant spent considerable amounts in the restoration of the premises, in
the acquisition of goods and in hiring and training of personnel. The expectation
of a secure legal framework for the investment was confirmed over a period of

16 months.

As the investment increased and matured, the consequences of any failure to
fulfil the legitimate expectations became increasingly severe. The implications
for the state’s obligations under the fair and equitable treatment standard are not
the same when a legitimate expectation is breached at the commencement of an

investment, as when the investment is well advanced.

The more time passed and the more efforts were made, the more Mr. Arif was
entitled to trust Respondent that it would stand by the contract terms and would
allow the realization of the investment. The contract was only a first step upon
which Mr. Arif based his expectation that he was entitled to run the airport shop.
The open, transparent and continuous performance of his investment contributed

to building legitimate trust in the validity of his position.

The problems with the Lease Agreement began on November 10, 2009 with the
suspension of the Lease Agreement by the Economic Circuit Court. On the same
date, the Airport State Authority wrote to Le Bridge advising that the Lease

Agreement had been suspended by court order, and issued Order 255 of 2009

140

setting out the terms of the suspension.*! Subsequent court orders produced
further suspension orders, confirming the contract suspension, the access
restrictions on the Le Bridge employees, and the paralysis of any business
activity on the premises. This situation of investment paralysis prevailed from
November 10, 2009, two days prior to the scheduled opening of the store, until
the decision of the Economic Court of Appeal on December 14, 2010. On this
date Claimant requested the cancellation of the suspension order in force at that

time (Order 272 of 2010),”*

access was granted on December 22, 2010 and
revoked again by the Airport authorities on December 25, 2010 on the basis of
the decision of the Economic Court of Appeal of December 22, 2010. The
premises were sealed and Claimant was denied access. Judicial proceedings

concluded with the Supreme Court decision of June 10, 2011.7

546.

a

After the Supreme Court decision, Claimant sought immediate access to the
premises to remove his stock. There was apparently no legal impediment to
immediate access. In fact Claimant was not granted access to the premises until
November 25, 2011; that is, over five months after the termination of the legal

proceedings.

547.

a

The legitimate expectation of the investor of a secure legal framework to operate
a duty free store at Chisinau Airport was breached by actions of Respondent. The
Tribunal refers to the following considerations that demonstrate this breach of
Claimant’s legitimate expectation and the standard of fair and equitable

treatment under the BIT:

(a) Claimant has not been able to open a duty free store at Chisinau Airport for
reasons that are the responsibility of Respondent under public international law,
namely the decisions by the Moldovan courts that the Airport Lease Agreement
was null and void and the cancellation of Minutes N° 9. The fact that Claimant
has legitimate expectations of an investment does not make the State guarantor
251 See Letter No. 1/525e from the Airport State Enterprise to Le Bridge dated November 10, 2009,
Exhibit C-101 to Claimant’s Memorial, and Order No. 255 on suspension of performance dated November
10, 2009, Exhibit C-102 to Claimant’s Memorial.
2 See Exhibit C-27 (Claimant’s letter of December 14, 2010) to Request for Arbitration and C-113

(Order 272 of 2010) to Claimant’s Memorial.
*53 See Exhibit C-130 to Claimant’s Memorial.

141

that the expectations will be fulfilled; rather the State is obliged to respect the
legitimate expectations and not be the operative cause of their frustration. In this
case, the frustration of the legitimate expectation was the direct result of the

intervention of a State organ;

(b) There is a direct inconsistency between the attitudes of different organs of the
State to the investment. The Airport State Enterprise and the State
Administration of Civil Aviation endorsed and encouraged the investment in the
airport premises, while the courts found the same investment to be illegal. This
type of direct inconsistency in itself amounts to a breach of the fair and equitable

treatment standard: see MTD Equity Sdn Bhd v. Republic of Chile™**;

(c) The Airport Lease Agreement was subject to Moldovan law and the proper
jurisdiction to determine its legality were the Moldovan courts. The judicial
review of administrative action is a normal occurrence in any State, and of course
the administrative authorities of Moldova, such as the Airport State Enterprise,
have to respect and comply with the judicial decisions at the domestic level.
However, at the international level, the State has a unitary nature, and a
contradiction in the actions of the State cannot be resolved on the international
plane by reference to its internal legal order. It is well established that a State

cannot rely on its internal law to justify an internationally wrongful act;

(d) The investor here does not complain of non-performance of the contract (that
might be adjudicated and remedied in domestic courts without invoking
international responsibility) but of the non-existence of a contract entered into by
the State and on the basis of which Claimant has made a substantial investment.
It is important to emphasise that the legitimate expectation that is breached in this
case is not that Respondent has failed to perform a lease contract for a duty free
shop at Chisinau Airport, but rather the expectation of a secure legal framework
based on the conduct of State organs that authorised and encouraged the

investment in the leased premises at Chisinau Airport;

254 (2005) 44 ILM 91.

142

(e) Where a state creates a legitimate expectation which it cannot subsequently
fulfil in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the BIT, then
the State has a secondary legal obligation to remedy or ameliorate the

consequences of its breach;

(f) Respondent has breached the legitimate expectation that Claimant could
operate a duty free shop in his leased premises at Chisinau Airport, but also
breached its secondary obligation to remedy or ameliorate its inability to fulfil
this legitimate expectation. In response firstly to the provisional measures
suspending the Lease Agreement, and then to the decisions cancelling the Airport
Lease Agreement, the Airport State Authority took no remedial action. It
behaved as a powerless bystander, rather than as an organ of the State whose
illegal actions first paralysed and then destroyed an investment that it had
encouraged. It was quick to enforce court orders against Claimant, but slow to
facilitate access to Claimant’s staff or to permit the movement of goods when
legal impediments were removed. There seem to have been no initiatives to
investigate temporary or alternative arrangements to preserve Claimant’s
business opportunity or goods, or to minimise or compensate Claimant for his
losses. The manner that the Airport State Enterprise washed its hands of the
consequences of its own illegality is the most reprehensible element of
Respondent’s conduct. Independently of the legitimate expectations created and
not fulfilled, this inertia in the face of the paralysis and then destruction of an

investment is a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the BIT.

e) The Border Stores

548. Claimant also alleges breaches of legitimate expectations in Respondent’s
treatment of his border stores. He refers specifically to the failure of the Customs
Service to allocate land and/or premises to Claimant to open a duty free store in
Ungheni, the delays caused by the requirements of the fire service, the unfair and
inequitable suspension by the NACP of the July 1, 2008 Agreement’s exclusivity
clause, the agreements of the Customs Offices of Leuseni and Cahul with better
locations given to Dufremol; the annulment by the Supreme Court on November

24, 2010 of the Tender results and the July 1, 2008 Agreement formalising them

143

and the decisions of the first and second instance courts to invalidate the lease
agreements for the border stores. Claimant finally alleges that various organs of
Respondent harassed and attempted to intimidate him in respect of his

. 2s.
investment.?°>

549. Claimant also expressed the legitimate expectation more generally as
“Claimant's legitimate expectations that Moldova would honor its specific

F 99256
commitments undertaken towards Mr. Arif.

550. The Tribunal has already noted that not every expectation of an investor amounts
to a legitimate expectation protected under the fair and equitable treatment
standard in public international law. Expectations that are purely contractual by
nature are protected by the applicable jurisdiction under the contract; other
expectations of a minor nature might not be of sufficient significance to entail
responsibility of the State. These distinctions are particularly important in
relation to the allegations of breach of the legitimate expectations in relation to

Claimant’s border stores.

551.

Claimant participated in a Tender for the creation of a network of duty free

stores at five border locations.”*’ The Tender contains no mention of exclusivity.

Claimant was successful in the Tender and subsequently entered into the July 1,

2008 Agreement with the Customs Service of the Republic of Moldova. The July

1, 2008 Agreement referred in its Whereas 4 to an ‘exclusive right’:
“4. The Authority grants, as it is foreseen in p.1.1, to the Investor the
exclusive right to manage and administrate the duty-free store network on
the pre-established territories, at the exclusive managerial risk of the
Investor, according to the provisions of this Agreement. The parties
acknowledge that the creation and operation of this store network shall
need a substantial investment from the part of the Investor in order to
assure the realization of business plan provisions accepted by the
organization commission;”

255 See Claimant’s Memorial, paras. 455-461.

256 See Claimant's Reply, para. 538.

?57 See Decision No. 172 on the creation of a network of duty-free stores at state border crossing stations,
dated February 18, 2008, Exhibit C-8 to Request for Arbitration.

144

552.

553.

554.

555.

This ‘exclusive right’ was defined in Clause 1.1.:
“ Exclusive rights: exclusive right of the Investor to manage and
administrate the duty-free store network at the state border crossing points
is established by the Government Decision no. 172 of 18 February 2008 at
the exclusive managerial risk of the Investor according to the provisions of
this Agreement. The exclusive rights of the Investor shall not be opposable
any longer to the Authority when, following the organization, according to
the legislation, of a public tender, a third party shall obtain the right to

build and open duty-free-stores at the state border crossing points.”

This is a qualified and ambiguous exclusive right. It refers to the Tender
(“Government Decision no. 172 of 18 February 2008”) but this Tender, as
already mentioned, did not offer or establish any exclusive right. Further, the
definition in fact recognised that the Authority could conduct another tender to
allow a third party to build and open duty free stores, so the ‘exclusivity’ was not
expected to endure any longer than the Authority required to organise such a

tender.

The qualified and ambiguous references to exclusivity do not support a
legitimate expectation that Claimant would have an exclusive right to operate
duty free stores at the border locations. The only legitimate expectation of
Claimant for the purposes of the fair and equitable treatment obligation in Article
3 of the BIT in relation to the border stores was the more generalised expectation
that Claimant was entitled to open duty free stores at five named border

locations, and that the State would co-operate with him in this regard.

The legitimate expectation of Claimant thus identified has not been breached by
Respondent. The Tribunal refers to the following considerations to confirm the
proper identification of the legitimate expectation and the fact that it has not

been breached:

145

(a) The Tender issued by the government, Claimant’s success in the Tender, and
the July 1, 2008 Agreement created and confirmed a legitimate expectation that

Claimant could open duty free stores at five border locations;

(b) There was no exclusivity offered in the Tender. The exclusivity rights in the
July 1, 2008 Agreement were qualified and ambiguous and not supported in the
Tender. These exclusivity rights were subject to the law of Moldova and the
dispute resolution clause in the July 1, 2008 Agreement and any expectations
were protected in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and not pursuant

to the BIT;

(c) The suspension of the exclusivity clause did not involve any inconsistency at
the international level between two organs of the Moldovan State. Claimant had
no legitimate expectation of exclusivity and the NACP was duly authorised
under domestic law to decide on the legitimacy of the exclusivity obligation.
This decision did not affect Claimant’s expectation to establish five border duty
free shops, merely one aspect of the contractually negotiated terms of the

implementation of this expectation;

(d) It has not been demonstrated that the delays caused by the fire authorities

were not the result of justifiable concerns by the appropriate authorities;

(e) The various complaints against individual customs offices, if justified, did
not breach Claimant’s legitimate expectation to open duty free stores at five
border locations. Exclusivity was not an element of Claimant’s legitimate
expectations, as already explained, so Claimant cannot complain that the
customs offices entered into agreements with Claimant’s competitors. Further,
the respective locations negotiated with individual customs offices by Claimant
and Claimant’s competitor is not a matter that engages legitimate expectations

under the fair and equitable treatment standard;
(f) The most serious threat to Claimant’s legitimate expectation to open his duty
free stores at the border locations has been the litigation initiated by Dufremol to

declare illegal the success of Claimant in the Tender, and the subsequent

146

agreements with the customs offices. Dufremol has been successful in this
litigation, including before the Supreme Court which confirmed the declarations
of illegality of the lower courts in its decision dated November 24, 2010.?°* The
outcome of this litigation challenges the expectations created by Respondent
through the Tender, the July 1, 2008 Agreement, subsequent agreements with
individual customs offices, and the fact of Claimant’s investment development
and opening of the four border stores. The Tribunal recognises that the potential
inconsistency between the expectations created by Respondent’s administrative
organs and the decisions of its judicial organs may be a source of problems in the

future;

(g) However, this litigation has not resulted in the closure of Claimant’s four
border stores. Having created the legitimate expectation that Claimant is entitled
to operate these stores, Respondent has an obligation to ensure that Claimant’s
investment in the four border stores is respected or Claimant is compensated for
any loss. Accordingly, should subsequent judicial proceedings arising from the
Dufremol litigation lead to court orders for closure of these stores, Respondent
would be required to take action to remedy the consequences of a breach of
Respondent’s legitimate expectations. However, as the closure of these stores
has not occurred or been ordered at the time of this award, there is not yet any

breach of Claimant’s legitimate expectations in relation to the four border stores.

Sf) Fair and Equitable Treatment: Conclusions

556.

557.

For these reasons, the Tribunal considers that Claimant’s investment in the
Airport store has not received fair and equitable treatment in accordance with
Article 3 of the France-Moldova BIT. Claimant is entitled to reparation. On the
other hand, there is no breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation in

respect of the border stores.

The Tribunal has analysed Respondent’s treatment of Claimant’s investment
primarily through the prism of legitimate expectations, referring as well to

consistency and good faith. Claimant presented his case in a similar manner. The

?58 See Decision of the Supreme Court of Justice, dated November 24, 2010, Exhibit C-155 to Claimant’s
Memorial.

147

Tribunal has also considered other expressions of the fair and equitable treatment
obligation referred to by the Parties or in the case law cited by them (such as the
need for transparency, or to avoid harassment or arbitrary or discriminatory
treatment) and has concluded that they do not raise additional questions that

require separate analysis.

558. There were also additional factual allegations that in the Tribunal’s view do not
affect the analysis of Claimant’s legitimate expectations in relation to the airport
store or the border stores. For example, the allegations relating to the failure to
discipline Judge Namasco for his November 10, 2009 decision, or those relating
to the Customs Service’s failure to allocate land and/or premises to Claimant in
order to open a duty free store in Ungheni, do not affect the Tribunal’s

assessment of the treatment of Claimant’s legitimate expectations.

VII.REPARATION.-

559. It is a general obligation of a State guilty of an internationally wrongful act to
make reparation. This principle was famously stated in the Chorzéw Factory
Case,” and is summarised in Article 31 of the International Law Commission’s
Articles on State Responsibility.

“ARTICLE 31

Reparation

The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for

the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.

Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the

internationally wrongful act of a State.”

560. The Tribunal also refers to the principles of international law summarised in
Articles 34, 35 and 36 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State

Responsibility which are relevant to the analysis that follows in this

 

Se.
2° See 1927, P.C.I. J, Series A, N° 9 pages 21 and 47.

148

561.

“ARTICLE 34

Forms of reparation

Full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act
shall take the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either

singly or in combination...”

“ARTICLE 35

Restitution

A State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an
obligation to make restitution, that is, to re-establish the situation which
existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided and to the extent

that restitution:

(a) is not materially impossible;

(b) does not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving

from restitution instead of compensation.”

“ARTICLE 36

Compensation

1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an
obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such

damage is not made good by restitution.

2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage

including loss of profits insofar as it is established.”

Claimant claimed damages under three broad headings: (i) loss of profits in
relation to the border stores; (ii) loss of profits in relation to the airport store; and
(iii) moral damages. Claimant also seeks interest at a compound rate of LIBOR

plus 2% compounded semi-annually on the awarded Euro amounts. Claimant

149

provided two expert reports by Mr. John Ellison, a Consultant to KPMG,
quantifying Claimant’s alleged losses. Mr. Ellison’s reports valued the loss of
profits on the border stores under various scenarios. He calculated the loss of the
airport shop on two bases: loss of profits and wasted costs, which he identified as
alternative and not cumulative. The wasted costs include capital expenditure
(such as installing escalators at the airport), operating expenditures related
directly to the airport (such as advertising, payroll expenses and rent) and stock

purchases.

562. Claimant also seeks moral damages in the amount of € 5,000,000 for the pain,
stress, shock, anguish, humiliation and shame suffered as a result of Moldova’s
acts and omissions in relation to his investments, and the fact that he had to leave
the country for his own safety, depriving him of the opportunity to personally

manage his own business and to pursue new business opportunities.

563. Claimant has not established any breach by Respondent of its international
obligations in respect of the border stores, and so his quantification of his alleged
losses will not be further considered. The claims in relation to the airport store
and for moral damages will be further examined in light of Respondent’s

submissions and evidence, and the principles of public international law.

564. The starting point of Respondent’s position is that the primary form of reparation
for internationally wrongful acts is restitution. Respondent requested that, in the
event of the Tribunal finding liability, the possibility of restitution should be
investigated as an alternative to any damages that the Tribunal may award.”
Respondent also submitted that satisfaction would be an alternative remedy for
an adverse finding of a denial of justice, in certain circumstances,”"! but as the
premises for this submission do not accord with the findings of the Tribunal in

this case, satisfaction does not need to be further considered.

565. Respondent rejects the use of a DCF analysis for the calculation of Claimant’s

damages in relation to the airport store, particularly on the grounds that it is not

an appropriate methodology to value a business that was not a going concern at
the relevant time, and is premised on faulty and uncertain outputs. Respondent
accepts however that the wasted costs methodology could be employed to value
Claimant’s losses relating to the airport store, but rejects Claimant’s calculation
on the basis that (i) Claimant has failed to present evidence that the sums
requested are accurate; (ii) Claimant’s expenses are objectively unreasonable;
and (iii) Claimant failed to mitigate his damages. Respondent relies upon the
expert report of Mr. Timothy Hart who provides an alternative calculation of
Claimant’s alleged losses on a wasted costs basis. Respondent also argues that
the claim for moral damages is baseless, as Claimant “cannot satisfy the
extraordinary tests required for the recognition of separate and additional moral

99262
damages.

Restitution

. There was some discussion by the Parties at the Hearing regarding restitution,
leading the Tribunal to request that the Parties clarify their positions on
restitution after the Hearing. Much of the subsequent exchanges related to the
border stores, and are no longer relevant. In relation to the airport store, Claimant
stated that “...restitution would require Respondent to allow and to enable
Claimant to open and operate his duty free store at Chisinau International
Airport without undue interruption. This would require all relevant licenses and
authorizations to be (re)issued by Respondent and its organs to Le Bridge, as
well as a new lease agreement, at identical or essentially similar terms as the
former Airport Lease agreement, leasing out the exact same premises at the
Airport to Le Bridge for the same duration (and preferential renewal rights),
which would start to run at the date of the actual opening of the Airport

store."

Claimant went on to state that, in his view, “the reality is that Respondent is
unwilling or unable to extend a firm offer for restitution, backed by adequate
guarantees” and so insisted on reparation in the form of damages. He was more
direct in his letter of December 3, 2012, where he stated (paragraph 10) that

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 813; Respondent’s Rejoinder para. 475.
Claimant’ letter to the Tribunal dated December 11, 2012, para. 8.

151

“Claimant has at this stage no alternative claims to damages in relation to his

investment at the Airport’.

568. Respondent in its letters requested time to consider the form of any restitution in
relation to the airport store. Respondent stated in its letter of December 3, 2012
(page 2):

«Were the Tribunal to decide that Moldova bears responsibility for the
cancellation of the Airport Lease Agreement, Moldova stands by its
request for 60 days to determine if it can provide some form of restitution,
for example by arranging signature of a new lease agreement with Le
Bridge in conformity with applicable law, in lieu of whatever damages the

Tribunal might determine.»

569. The first issue that the Tribunal needs to consider is whether restitution can be
considered in circumstances where Claimant insists on damages. Respondent
argues that it should have the opportunity to provide restitution as an alternative
to damages, as this remedy would restore Claimant to the position he would have
been in without any violation of the BIT, and also avoids the uncertainties of the

calculation of damages, including the possibility of risk free windfall profits.

570. The Tribunal notes that the general position in international law is that the
injured State may elect between the available forms of reparation and may prefer
compensation to restitution.°™ On the other hand, restitution is more consistent
with the objectives of bilateral investment treaties, as it preserves both the

investment and the relationship between the investor and the Host State.

S71.

The Tribunal considers restitution to be the preferable remedy, but as in the
present case Respondent has not been able to confirm that restitution is possible,
and the Tribunal cannot supervise any restitutionary remedy, the best course is to
order restitution and compensation as alternatives, with the remedy of
compensation suspended for a period of ninety days. This provides Respondent

with the opportunity, in light of the findings of this award, to formulate and

264 See Commentary to Article 43 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility.

152

572.

b)

573

574.

propose to Claimant the exact mechanism of restitution. If restitution is not
possible, or the terms of restitution proposed by Respondent are not satisfactory
to Claimant then the damages awarded will satisfy the violation of Claimant’s
right to fair and equitable treatment. This solution provides a final opportunity to
preserve the investment, while also preserving Claimant’s right to damages if a

satisfactory restitutionary solution cannot be found.

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that, within a period of no more than sixty
days, Respondent will make a proposal to Claimant for the restitution of the
investment in the Airport store, including its proposals as to appropriate
guarantees for the legality of a new lease agreement. The Tribunal expects the
Parties to negotiate regarding this proposal in good faith, but confirms that
Claimant at any time within a period of ninety days from the date of this award
may elect to take the compensation as quantified in this Award in lieu of

restitution and Respondent is obliged to make the payment accordingly.
Damages

. Claimant’s loss of profits from the fact that the Chisinau airport store never
opened has been considered in two expert reports of Mr. John Ellison, submitted
on behalf of Claimant, and two expert reports by Mr. Timothy Hart submitted on
behalf of Respondent. The Tribunal has also heard the oral evidence of Mr.
Ellison and Mr. Hart at the Hearing.

Mr. Ellison calculated the loss of profits on two alternative bases. Firstly, using
the DCF methodology, Mr. Ellison estimated the loss of profits as the difference
between the actual financial performance of the airport shop (which never
opened or earned revenue, but did incur expenses) and the cash flows that the
airport shop would have achieved had it not been prevented from opening as
scheduled. Secondly, and in the alternative, Mr. Ellison calculated the wasted
costs of Claimant in relation to the airport costs. The DCF calculation was made
for two periods (depending on whether or not the Lease Agreement was renewed
for a second seven year term), and on three scenarios (‘low’, ‘base’ and ‘high’)

based on distinct projections of the growth in passenger figures at Chisinau

153

Airport, and the proportion of duty free business obtained by Claimant at

Chisinau Airport.

575. Mr. Hart rejected the DCF methodology as inappropriate for the calculation of
loss of profits at the airport shop. Mr. Hart states that the DCF is not appropriate
for a business that never opened or generated any revenue, and where no reliable
business plan has been produced. Mr. Hart challenged the assumptions on which
Mr. Ellison had projected the airport store’s revenue, as well as a discount rate
that, in Mr. Hart’s opinion, did not reflect the many risks associated with this

business venture.

576. After considering the testimony of these experts, the Tribunal considers that the
DCF methodology is not appropriate for a business that never operated and
where a satisfactory basis for its projected revenues has not been demonstrated.
Use of a DCF methodology in these circumstances gives an excessively
speculative outcome. Accordingly, the Tribunal calculates Claimant’s damages
on the second basis proposed by Mr. Ellison, namely the wasted costs

calculation.

577. Mr. Ellison calculated wasted costs by considering capital expenditures (to
ensure that the design, layout and facilities of the airport shops met international
standards) the operating costs, and the stock purchased for the airport shop
(some of which, mainly confectionary items, have been written off as being past
their expiry date). The loss of profits on this bas
second report) amounts to MDL 38,481,637.

 

(as updated in Mr. Ellison’s

578. Mr. Hart agreed that wasted costs were an appropriate measure of potential

damages in relation to the airport shop.”

However, Mr. Hart did not accept the
inclusion of stock that had not been written off, as even selling this stock in other
locations at a significant discount from market prices could yield a substantial
recovery of costs. He also makes an adjustment for tax. Mr. Hart also notes that

he has not had access to the supporting documentation made available to KPMG

°5 See Expert Report of Timothy H. Hart, para. 191; Second Report of Timothy H. Hart, paras. 74-75 and
83.

580.

581.

in Moldova, so has not been able to independently check the accuracy of the
costs figures. Mr. Hart in his second report calculates the wasted costs at MDL
20,400,000.

In relation to these costs, the Tribunal accepts the accuracy of the records on

 

which Mr. Ellison calculated his wasted costs figures. Mr. Ellison stated that in
his professional opinion “the costs I have been provided by Le Bridge are the
true costs that they incurred in setting up the airport shop”. 266 Mr. Ellison states
that he relied on copies of Le Bridge’s internal accountancy ledgers and that he
selected a sample of costs to be checked by KPMG Moldova, who reported back

that the costs were supported by genuine invoices.

Claimant was required by his contracts with suppliers to sell certain items at the
airport store, so with the closure of this store the border stores did not provide an
alternative outlet. Claimant paid cash for his stock, so that the prospects of
returning stock to suppliers are not good. Mr. Hart also pointed out that the stock
had not been written off in Claimant’s own books, and Mr. Ellison responded
doubting the relevance of the internal book-keeping and noting that they may
well be written off in the next audited accounts. Mr. Ellison accepted that some
of this stock would be successfully sold, and to avoid double recovery, there
should be an adjustment for this amount. He accepted that a 20% reduction

would not be objectionable.”

The evidence regarding stock in the airport store is not entirely sati

 

tory as it
is clear that some will be sold in future, but not all, so an amount for stock
should be included in the wasted cost calculation, but the actual amount remains
uncertain. In these circumstances the Tribunal accepts a 20% reduction in Mr.

Ellison’s figure as an acceptable adjustment. Accordingly, it accepts the

 

following calculation of damages on the basis of airport wasted co:

store never opens. No further adjustment for tax is required. If the airport store
does open, in accordance with the restitutional remedy ordered by the Tribunal,
then the capital expenditure and the stock not already written off will no longer

be wasted. In this scenario Claimant can only recover for the stock actually

 

written off as well as the operating costs that have been wasted as a result of the
delays in opening the store. Accordingly, if the airport store were to open,

Claimant’s recovery for wasted costs would be limited to MDL 6,565,429.

Accordingly, the Tribunal orders that Respondent pay to Claimant by way of
damages for its breaches of the BIT in relation to the airport store the sum of
MDL 6,565,429 if Respondent makes a satisfactory proposal to Claimant for his
investment and the Parties agree to the opening and operation of the airport store.
If no satisfactory restitution occurs, then Respondent shall pay damages of MDL

35,136,294.

Moral Damages

(i) The Legal Position

584. There is no doubt that moral damages may be awarded in international law (see,

585.

a

for example, Article 31(2) of the International Law Commission’s Articles on

State Responsibility) although they are an exceptional remedy.

Claimant asserts that “the notion of moral damages encompasses a broad range
of elements which include personal injury [...], emotional harm [...],
pathological harm [...], and minor consequences of a wrongful act (such as, for

example, the affront associated with the mere fact of a breach). 7268

268 See Claimant’s Memorial, at para 588,

156

586. Claimant relies on case law and asserts that tribunals and umpires have regularly

awarded compensation for moral damages in situations of “injury to a

corporation's credit, reputation and prestige’

587. The Parties both referred to the award in Joseph Charles Lemire v Ukraine™’

*°269 and refers to Fabiani, where:

“the President of the Swiss Confederation concluded that the repeated
denials of justice to which Fabiani had been subjected led to his
bankruptcy and loss of prestige.

As a result, Fabiani was awarded moral damages on the ground that, had
it not been for the pain and suffering inflicted, he would have given
another dimension to his business in general, and explored other sources

of revenues, earning him profits over and beyond the lost profits’?

1

and particularly the passage of paragraph 333 after discussion of three previous

cases:

“333. The conclusion which can be drawn from the above case law is
that, as a general rule, moral damages are not available to a party
injured by the wrongful acts of a State, but that moral damages can be

awarded in exceptional cases, provided that:

-the State’s actions imply physical threat, illegal detention or other
analogous situations in which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms
according to which civilized nations are expected to act;

-the State’s actions cause a deterioration of health, stress, anxiety, other
mental suffering such as humiliation, shame and degradation, or loss of
reputation, credit and social position; and

-both cause and effect are grave or substantial.”

588. Respondent submitted that the gravity of the harm suffered by Mr. Arif “could

not be likened to the hurt caused by armed threats, or by witnessing the deaths of

others, or the other types of suffering endured by claimants in earlier cases

? See Claimant’:

's Memorial, at para 591, in quoting DLP v. Yemen, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/I7, Award

of 29 January 2008.
27° See Claimant's Memorial, at para 590.
27! See Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine, (CSID Case ARB 06/18 Award, March 28, 2011.

157

where moral damages were awarded.” Respondent also suggests that

Claimant has not demonstrated the other two elements of the test in Lemire.

589. Claimant emphasised the second element of the Lemire formula, which is

. oo 2
derived from the Lusitania case?”

590. The Tribunal notes that the formulation of the principles of the award of moral
damages in Lemire was based on a limited discussion of three cases, with no
broader consideration of underlying principles or policies. The statement might
serve as a summary of the issues in these cases, but it should not be taken as a
cumulative list of criteria that must be demonstrated for an award of moral
damages. The first element, in particular, might reflect the particular
circumstances of the Desert Line Projects LLC v Republic of Yemen case*”* but
the facts of a single case do not define the availability of moral damages as a

remedy.

591.

In the Tribunal’s view, the older Lusitania case, the basis of the second factor in
Lemire, correctly states the criteria the Tribunal should take into account. This
leaves the Tribunal with an element of discretion, but within the general

framework that moral damages are an exceptional remedy.

592. The element of exceptionality must be acknowledged and respected. A breach of
a contract or any wrongful act can lead to a sentiment of frustration and affront
with the victim. A pecuniary premium for compensation for such sentiment, in
addition to the compensation of economic damages, would have an enormous
impact on the system of contractual and tortious relations. It would
systematically create financial advantages for the victim which go beyond the
traditional concept of compensation. The fundamental balance of the allocation
of risks would be distorted. It would have similar effects if permitted in
investment arbitration. The Tribunal is therefore aligning itself to the majority of

arbitral decisions and holds that compensation for moral damages can only be

awarded in exceptional cases, when both the conduct of the violator and the

prejudice of the victim are grave and substantial.

(ii) Claimant’s position

593.

594,

595.

 
 

Claimant requests “compensation for the moral damages he has suffered, caused
by (i) the pain, stress, shock, anguish, humiliation and shame that he has
suffered as a result of Moldova’s acts and omissions in relation to his
investments in the duty free sector; and (ii) the fact that he had to leave the
country for his own safety, which deprived him of the opportunity to personally
manage and further develop the business activities of the Le Bridge group of

. 5 «og M275
companies, and pursue new business opportunities.
Claimant details elements which lead him to claim an amount of € 5,000,000.2"°

Claimant alleges that he and his companies have been mistreated and harassed,
not only by the court proceedings and decisions at the instigation of competitors,
but also by endless attempts of state authorities to intimidate him and his
business, starting from December 2010, with a raid executed by the CCECC. He
relates that, on 17 December 2010, CCECC officers raided his home, where he
was lying sick, and the offices of his companies in Chisinau. He claims that the
raid continued until the 1" of February and then again until August 2011, under
the pretext of an investigation for tax evasion. He states that the CCECC traveled
to Kyiv and informed business partners about the criminal investigations, and
that it equally informed local banks. Although the investigations have not
brought any results, they have not been terminated, with the consequence that he
had to leave the country, fearing for his personal security.?” In addition, the
Anticorruption Section of the Prosecutor’s Office maneuvered to have his duty
free licenses cancelled. This was, however, refused by the Licensing Chamber of

the Ministry of Economy, which contented itself to issue a warning.>”* During a

a

Claimant summarizes the harassment allegations by stating that “/fJrom a
devoted and groundbreaking investor in the duty free sector, who was moreover
encouraged to invest therein by Moldova, Mr. Arif was turned into a beggar,

forced to defend himself and fight for his survival’”*®,

Respondent’s Position

597. Respondent refutes Claimant’s assertions with respect to a free-standing claim
for moral damages. It asserts that such a separate claim is only available under
“the rarest of circumstances” and that in any event Respondent’s conduct was

legal and did not cause humiliation or shame to Claimant”*'.

598. Respondent submits that investigations by Moldovan authorities were legitimate,
in bona fide and following procedural rules. It recalls that the duty free business
at border crossings had previously been closed by Moldova because of heavy
cigarette smuggling and that it was normal that the authorities had remained
suspicious and wanted to prevent repetitions of that kind of business.” The fact
that the investigators did not find evidence of wrong-doing is not a reason to

conclude on their bad faith, but rather a sign of thoroughness and fairness.

599. It further submits that Claimant has not provided any evidence:
-that the investigations were conducted with an aim to intimidate him or his
employees,
-that his personal security was endangered,

-that a plot against him was planned.

paras. 476 and 481.

160

(iv)

600. It finally alleges that the government actions, which Claimant complains of, had
no impact on his business reputation and did not cause lasting prejudice. It is
uncontested:

-that the business partners from Kyiv continue their business relations,

-that Claimant’s companies have not been prevented from doing profitable
business in different spheres, and

- that even in the duty free sector, Claimant has expanded and created new border

duty free shops, while the four shops in dispute continue to operate.”

601.

Respondent finally asserts that “to the extent Claimant has suffered any such
loss, he already would be sufficiently compensated for that loss by any award of

oy 284
monetary damages”.

The Tribunal’s Decision

602. The Tribunal has to determine whether in the case at hand the conduct of
Respondent and the suffering of Claimant have been so grave and substantial, as
to amount to such exceptional circumstances that necessitate a pecuniary

compensation for moral damages.

603. The dividing line between what is normal and what is exceptional in commercial
life (a mere breach, versus a breach causing grave and substantial pain and
suffering) can only be determined by a precise appreciation of the facts. They
cannot be considered in isolation, but against the background of the Moldovan

economy and governance.

604. Mr. Arif is “an experienced professional and seasoned entrepreneur”?* In
1998 he took the courageous decision to invest in the emerging market economy
of Moldova and he succeeded to build and manage a sound and profitable
business during a period when the country transited from a Soviet to a market
economy, a difficult and contradictory path indeed, characterized by instability

and the unpredictability of economic and political institutions. In that situation,

25} See Respondent’s Rejoinder, paras. 481 s.
**4 See Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para 819.
°85 See Lemire, at 337.

161

the country — such as other post-soviet States — offered exceptional business

opportunities, but at the same time high risks.

605. Mr. Arif was and is aware of this situation and the necessity of mental fortitude
to meet the incidents of commercial and political life in a transition economy. He
knows that in Moldova State institutions are weak, that governance is improving,
but is not yet comparable to the situation in long established democracies and

market economies.

606. These circumstances do not lower the standard of investment protection provided
by a BIT or excuse breaches of that standard. They have, however, an inevitable
bearing on what characterizes “exceptional circumstances” as a threshold for the
pecuniary compensation for moral damages. The perception of an egregious
behavior is different in different business traditions. On the one hand, the loss of
reputation as a consequence of governmental and police interference is much
less dramatic in countries where the rule of law and protection against
administrative discretion are low and any business is exposed to this risk,
irrespective of its conduct, and, on the other hand, the individual’s expectations

are different and less easily to be shocked.

607.

a

Neither Mr. Arif, nor any of his relatives or employees have been exposed to
physical violence, armed threats, deprivation of liberty or a forceful taking of
property. One of top ranking managers of Le Bridge has testified that she and
other employees personally and physically resisted the closing of border shops.
They finally could not prevent it. But only days later the shops were allowed to

286

open again and none of the employees suffered any prosecution.” No property

was taken, let alone by force.

608.

%

Claimant submits:
- that he left Chisinau at one point in time by car to Romania “under private
escort”, thus insinuating that the protection was necessary, a fact that however is

not proved,

28 See Witness Statement of Ms. Irina Chirlescu, paras. 56 and 57.

162

- that CCECC officers started the raid when he was lying sick in bed, but there is
no evidence that this was intentional,
- that everything happened to him short of being killed, but again there is no

evidence to confirm this.

609. The prolonged raids of the CCECC play an important role in the recital of
harassment. Claimant quotes an Investment Climate Statement by the US
Embassy as highlighting that “companies out of favor with the government or
with politically-connected individuals can rapidly become the target of

287

politically motivated investigations” conducted by the CCECC,~’ while the

Statement itself only writes about “allegations in recent years from companies”

in that sense.”**

610. The search and investigations by the CCECC may have been unpleasant and
painful, but they were conducted in accordance with Moldovan procedural law,
upon an order and under the supervision of a judge after a request from a

prosecutor,”

and carefully minuted. The CCECC report seems fair, was
consented to by Le Bridge’s deputy director, Mrs. May Arif, it exonerated Le
Bridge and Mr. Arif on most counts and was signed by CCECC officers, but also

290

by Claimant and Le Bridge’s accountant on 5 August 2011,°” i.e. almost one

year after Mr. Arif left the country.

611.

As a result of the investigations, Le Bridge had to pay minor penalties for tax
irregularities”' which were later reduced by Decision of the Director of the
CCECC.”” There is no evidence of any threat or intimidation against Mr. Arif,
no sign of danger for his personal security and liberty or the security of his
employees, no hint as to a plot and apparently no sign of a real risk for him to be

present in Chisinau.

It is true that in addition to the penalties, the prosecutor asked the Licensing
Chamber of the Ministry of the Economy on July 1, 2011 to withdraw Le
Bridge’s licenses for the sale of goods in duty-free shops,””? but the Licensing
Chamber did not grant the request and only issued a “disposition” on 5
September 2011 to “warn about the possible withdrawal of the license, if the
said violations will not be liquidated in the designed period”. The violation was
4

described as alleged non-compliance with the Customs Code requirements.”

The warning did not materialize and the licenses are valid until today.

Claimant suggests that the government’s conduct turned him into a beggar. He
refers to the Fabiani decision where Mr. Fabiani had been expropriated of all his
property in Venezuela and thus driven into bankruptcy, and where the Umpire

had granted moral damages based on these facts.

The Tribunal has weighed the facts of the present case and compared them with
Fabiani. It is unable to see the same type of gravity and consequences. It is
uncontested that Claimant’s companies are not hindered to do profitable business
in Moldova and grow; there is no evidence of a threatening bankruptcy. This is
particularly true for the duty free stores at the border, where Claimant was able
to expand and create new border shops while the ones in dispute continue to
operate. The different investigations have apparently not hurt his reputation: Le
Bridge continues to work with Moldovan banks. His business partners in Kyiv

* which were

asked him for explanations after the visit by CCECC officers,”
apparently considered satisfactory for them, since they continue their business

relationship.

After having carefully considered all the circumstances, the Tribunal is
convinced that the conduct of the Moldovan authorities provoked stress and
anxiety to Claimant. However, the different actions did not reach a level of

gravity and intensity which would allow it to conclude that there were

exceptional circumstances which would entail the need for a pecuniary
compensation for moral damages. For these reasons, the claim for moral

damages is dismissed.
Interest

. Claimant seeks “an award of compound interest at a rate of LIBOR + 2

ded s lly, to be blished on the ded Euro amounts as

at the date these amounts are determined to have been due to the Claimant.”?**

Claimant referred to three awards, but made no further submissions in relation to
the entitlement to interest, the rate, the right to compound interest or the date
from which interest should begin to run. Respondent made no submissions on
this issue. There is no provision in the France-Moldova BIT relevant to the issue

of an award of interest in relation to the breach of the FET standard.

 

Article 38 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State

 

Responsibility confirms that interest will be payable “when necessary in order to
ensure full reparation”. It also confirms that the general view in international
law is in favour of simple and not compound interest, although other
commentators suggest the trend in investment arbitration is in favour of

compound interest.?””

In the current case, there is no single date when the breach of Claimant’s
legitimate expectations occurred or was manifested; rather the breach was the
result of a combination of factors over a period of time. Further, Claimant’s
damages, including the moral damages, were not capable of quantification until
the Hearing. In these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the obligation to

pay interest only arises from the date of the award.
Claimant has not justified the use of a LIBOR rate with a premium in a claim
made in Moldovan currency or Euro equivalent, and where the investor is a

national of a Euro state. Claimant has not justified compound interest, and given

the nature of the damages in this case, the Tribunal considers simple interest is

more appropriate.

Accordingly, the Tribunal awards interest on Claimant’s damages from the date

of the award until the date of payment on a simple basis at the EURIBOR rate.

Currency and Payment Issues

. Claimant sought certain ancillary relief in relation to damages. Firstly, the claim
for relief sought the award of damages expressed in Euros. Secondly, Claimant
sought payment of damages ‘outside of the Republic of Moldova without any
right of set-off’.

Neither party made further submissions on these questions, although they had the
opportunity to do so in the extensive discussion of damages. Accordingly, the
Tribunal deals with these ancillary questions in accordance with general

principles.

The expert witnesses analysed the wasted costs question in terms of Moldovan
Leu, and not in Euros. The Tribunal has accordingly quantified Claimant’s losses

in Moldovan Leu.

The general position in international law is that compensation should be paid in a
freely convertible currency, and tribunals have frequently ordered compensation
in the currency of the claimant’s nationality, although another possibility is the
currency in which the investment is made.””* There is no evidence in this case of
currency related factors such as abnormal movement in rates that might affect
the Tribunal’s choice of currency or date of conversion. Nor have the Parties
identified the appropriate date or rate of conversion if the Tribunal orders

damages to be paid in Euros.

625. The principle of free transfer of funds forms part of the obligations of Moldova
to French citizens under Article 6 of the France-Moldova BIT which specifically
refers to the right of free transfer of:

“d) Value of partial and total liquidation or disposition of the investment,
including capital gains on the capital invested;

e) Compensations for dispossession or loss, in accordance with Article 5
and paragraph 2) and 3) stated above [which related to compensation for

expropriation, and circumstances of war or civil emergency].”

626. Article 6 continues to state that transfers “shall be made without delays, and at

the normal exchange rate officially applicable on the date of transfer.”

627. The Tribunal considers that it is appropriate in this case to award the payment of
damages in Euros, as the currency of Claimant’s nationality. As to the date of
conversion, the obligation of Respondent to pay damages in this case arises from
the date of the Award, although the amount will not be fixed until Claimant
decides whether to accept or reject restitution. In accordance with Article 6,
Moldova then has an obligation to pay damages “without delays, and at the
normal exchange rate officially applicable on the date of transfer”. Accordingly,
the date of payment is the date of conversion, and any delay by Respondent will
involve a breach of the BIT. Further, in accordance with Article 6, Moldova

must permit the free transfer of Claimant’s damages, and the Tribunal so orders.

VIII. CostTs.-

628. Both Parties have claimed costs in this arbitration and filed short submissions
quantifying their fees and costs. Claimant in his closing submissions, in support
of his claim for costs, argued that Respondent raised needless jurisdictional
objections that delayed the proceedings and substantially raised the costs for

Claimant.”

Article 61(2) of the Washington Convention leaves the award of costs to the

discretion of the Arbitral Tribunal “except as the parties otherwise agree”.

Article 7 of the France-Moldova BIT makes no mention of the question of the
costs of an investor-State arbitration. There are two strands of ICSID
jurisprudence in relation to costs, with one strand favouring the principle that the
fees and expenses of the Centre and of the arbitrator should be shared equally,
and that each party should bear its own legal fees and expenses. The second and
perhaps more modern strand is for the costs to be awarded on the basis of the

relative success of the parties in the arbitration.

In the current case, Claimant has been successful on the issue of jurisdiction, has
established a breach by Respondent of the fair and equitable treatment standard
of the France-Moldova BIT, and has established his right to restitution and
damages. On the other hand, his claims for expropriation, denial of justice and
moral damages have failed, as well as his claims of specific undertakings,
unreasonable or arbitrary measures, full protection and security, discrimination
and compensation. The questions of liability and the quantification of damages
in relation to the border stores occupied a significant part of the proceedings. The
Tribunal is not satisfied that Respondent’s jurisdictional objections justify an

award of costs in favour of Claimant.
For these reasons, the Tribunal decides that each party should bear equally the

costs and expenses of the arbitration, and each party should bear its own legal

fees and costs.
