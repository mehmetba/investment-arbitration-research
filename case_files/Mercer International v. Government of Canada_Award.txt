PART I: THE ARBITRATION

The Parties

The Claimant: The Claimant is Mercer International Inc. (“Mercer” or “the Claimant’), a
corporation established under the laws of the state of Washington in the United States of
America. Through Mercer’s Canadian affiliates owned and/or controlled by it, Zellstoff
Celgar Limited (“ZCL”) and Zellstoff Celgar Limited Partnership (“ZCLP” or “Celgar’),
Mercer indirectly owns and operates an industrial plant in Castlegar, British Columbia,
Canada (the “Celgar Mill” or the “Mill”). Mercer has a place of business at Suite 1120, 700
‘West Pender St Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 1G8, Canada.

For the purpose of this arbitration, as pleaded by the Claimant under NAFTA Articles
1116(1) and 1117(1), the Claimant (Mercer) is the “investor” and the “enterprise” is ZCL.
For ease of reference, ZCL and Celgar are collectively called “Celgar” (save where the

context requires otherwise).

The Respondent: The Respondent is Canada (“Canada” or “the Respondent”), a Party to
the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) with the USA and Mexico that

entered into force on 1 January 1994.
The Arbitration Agreement

This arbitration takes place under an arbitration agreement invoked by the Claimant
resulting from its consent and that of its enterprise, both of which accompanied the Request
for Arbitration dated 30 April 2012, NAFTA Articles 1116(1), 1117(1) and 1122(1), to
submit their claims to arbitration under the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules
(the “ICSID Arbitration AF Rules’). For ease of reference, this arbitration agreement is

here called the “Arbitration Agreement.”

The Respondent denies the jurisdiction of this Tribunal (including the exercise of
jurisdiction), as asserted by the Claimant for certain of its claims against the Respondent

under the Arbitration Agreement.

1.31 At the end of the Hearing, the evidential record was, in principle, closed to the Parties.?

1.32 Procedure after the Hearing: By order of the Tribunal, the Claimant filed its Post-Hearing
Submission on 7 January 2016 and the Respondent on 26 February 2016. The Parties
further exchanged written submissions on costs after the Hearing, as follows: (i) the
Claimant’s initial submission on costs of 15 March 2016; (ii) the Respondent’s initial
submission on costs of 15 March 2016; (iii) the Claimant’s supplemental submission on
costs of 3 April 2017; and (iv) the Respondent’s updated costs statement also of 3 April
2017.

1.33. There also followed, after Hearing, a number of procedural applications that the Tribunal

addressed in its Procedural “Omnibus” Order No 13 of 6 March 2017. The Tribunal

decided, inter alia, the following matters: (1) the Respondent’s letter of 6 November 2015
requesting permission to file new evidence concerning two decisions of the B.C. Utilities
Commission or BCUC (the “Respondent’s Request to File New Evidence”), with related
correspondence and the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 10; (2) the Claimant’s letter of 4
April 2016 requesting permission to file the new BCUC Decision and Order G-27-16 as
new evidence (the “Claimant’s Request to File New Evidence’), with related
correspondence and the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 12; (3) the Claimant’s letter of 7
January 2016 requesting that the Tribunal resolve disputes between the Parties concerning
the Respondent’s proposed redactions to the transcript of the Hearing (the “Claimant’s
Request Concerning Redactions to the Hearing Transcript”), with related correspondence
and the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 11; (4) the Respondent’s letter of 16 August 2016
concerning the Claimant’s proposed confidentiality designations in its Statement of Costs
(the “Respondent’s Request Concerning Confidentiality Designations in the Claimant’s
Costs Statement”); (5) the Respondent’s letter of 15 April 2016 requesting that the Tribunal
close the evidential record to any new evidence following its decisions on the pending
applications (the “Respondent’s Closure Request”); (6) the Respondent’s corrected
communication of 25 November 2016 requesting, conditionally, a term sheet between
Celgar and FortisBC to be produced by the Claimant with ancillary relief; and (7) the
Claimant’s communication of 30 November 2016 requesting that the Tribunal disregard

the Respondent’s communication of 25 November 2016.

In Paragraph 35 of Procedural Order No 13, the Tribunal found that it “does not consider
it necessary to decide the Claimant’s request, by its communication of 30 November 2016,
that the Tribunal should disregard the Respondent’s corrected communication of 25
November 2016. Further, the Tribunal does not think it necessary, for the time being at
least, to decide the Respondent’s application by its corrected communication of 25
November 2016. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal confirms that the Respondent’s
corrected communication is not evidence in this arbitration; nor was there any
documentary evidence attached to such communication. The Tribunal reserves the right to
review the situation, if and to the extent appropriate, following the Parties’ responses to

the order made above in Paragraph 34 and below in Paragraphs 43(a) and (b).”

In Paragraph 43 the Tribunal decided the remaining matters as follows:

“a. Regarding the Respondent’s Request to File New Evidence, the Tribunal grants
such request as made, save that either Party may make (but is not required to make)
any appropriate application to the Tribunal as soon as practicable, but not later than
21 days from the date of this Procedural Order, for permission to file further written
submissions regarding the weight or effect of this new documentary evidence, if
submitted;

b. Regarding the Claimant’s Request to File New Evidence, the Tribunal grants
such request as made, save that either Party may make (but is not required to make)
any appropriate application to the Tribunal as soon as practicable, but not later than
21 days from the date of this Procedural Order, for permission to file further written
submissions regarding the weight or effect of this new documentary evidence, if
submitted;

c. Regarding the Claimant’s Request Concerning Redactions to the Hearing
Transcript, the Tribunal dismisses such request, as a result of which the proposed
redactions from the Hearing Transcript shall be made as proposed by the
Respondent;

d. Regarding the Respondent’s Request Concerning Confidentiality Designations
in the Claimant’s Costs Statement, the Tribunal reserves its decision in full, save to
order the Claimant to explain its position in writing as soon as practicable, but not
later than 21 days from the date of this Procedural Order;

e. Regarding the Respondent’s Request regarding Closure, the Tribunal re-closes
the record to any new evidence and any new pleading from the Parties, unless
ordered by the Tribunal here or later; [...]”

“Post-Hearing New Evidence”: As regards Items Nos | and 2 in Paragraph 1 of Procedural
Order No 13, as decided in Paragraph 43 under sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), the Tribunal
thereby granted the requests by the Claimant and the Respondent respectively to introduce
their new factual evidence upon the terms ordered; namely the new evidence concerning
(i) the BCUC Decision and Order G-174-15 and the BCUC Decision and Order G-168-
15A); and (ii) the BCUC Decision and Order G-27-16. (The Tribunal refers to this evidence

below in Part ITI(I) as the “Post-Hearing New Evidence”.)

By letter dated 27 March 2017, with reference to Procedural Order No. 13, the Respondent
confirmed that it had no further comments on the weight and effect of the new evidence
admitted by the Tribunal on 6 March 2017. However, so its letter continued, should the

Claimant make an application under sub-paragraph 43(b) of Procedural Order No. 13 to

to grant this request, the Respondent requested that: (i) the Claimant’s submission be no
longer than three pages; (ii) the Respondent be given an opportunity to respond in a
submission of the same length; and (iii) to the extent the Claimant’s submission was
inconsistent with developments in the FortisBC Stage II Self-Generator Policy Application
then before the BCUC, the Tribunal should: (a) admit into the record FortisBC’s
application as well as the term sheet the Claimant negotiated with FortisBC which relates
to this proceeding; and (b) allow the Parties to file simultaneously three-page comments

on the application and the term sheet.

By email message also dated 27 March 2017, with reference to Paragraphs 34 and 43(a-b)
of Procedural Order 13, the Claimant confirmed that it did not seek permission to file any

further written submissions regarding the Parties’ Requests to File New Evidence.
Closing the File

By Paragraphs 41 and 43(e) of its Procedural Order No 13, the Tribunal closed the file to
the Parties, subject only to the terms of that order and without prejudice to Article 44(1) of
the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.

Under Article 44(1) of the ISCID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, the Tribunal
closed the file on 23 December 2017, subject only to matters concerning confidentiality

designations.

By Procedural Order No 14 of 23 January 2018, the Tribunal decided the Parties’ dispute
over confidentiality designations in the Claimant’s submissions on legal costs. As jointly
requested by the Parties, Paragraph 17 of the order stated that the Tribunal would designate
the Award “Restricted Access” until the Parties had had an opportunity to review it and
propose redactions pursuant to the Confidentiality Order and that the Tribunal would
remain seized of this matter to resolve any disputes over confidentiality designations in the
Award. Accordingly, PO No 14 further provided (inter alia) as follows: “... the Tribunal’s

PART IT: THE PARTIES’ DISPUTE

Introduction

The Parties’ dispute is best summarised for present purposes in their respective early
written pleadings. Inevitably, as these arbitration proceedings progressed, the issues
arising from the Parties’ dispute became more complex and more numerous, but their

dispute remained essentially the same.

The summaries below are taken largely from the Claimant’s Memorial and the
Respondent’s Counter-Memorial. The Tribunal emphasises that these are only brief and
necessarily incomplete summaries of the Parties’ respective cases and consist of
allegations or submissions made by the Parties and not findings or decisions by the

Tribunal.
The Claimant’s Case

In summary, through its Canadian affiliates, ZCL and Celgar, Mercer owns and operates
the Celgar Mill in Castlegar, British Columbia, Canada that uses an integrated, joint
production process to produce Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (“NBSK”) market
pulp and to generate biomass-based, “green” electricity.* The Celgar Mill’s generation
capacity to produce “green” electricity is capable of exceeding the Mill’s own

electricity load.°

The regulatory issue in dispute concerns the extent and conditions under which the
British Columbia Province permits the Celgar Mill to purchase electricity to meet the
needs of its pulp operations from its local electricity utility (“FortisBC”), at normal rates
based on the actual “embedded costs” of service, whilst the Mill is also selling its self-

generated biomass-based green electricity.°

By “embedded costs”, the Claimant means the total cost of all a utility’s electricity
resources, including the depreciation expense associated with the historical costs of

generation assets, divided by the total electricity volume, which yields an overall

average unit cost of electricity. The British Columbia Utilities Commission (“BCUC”),
as the Provincial public utility regulatory agency, has defined embedded cost of service
power as “the weighted average cost of existing sources of power in a utility’s resource

stack.” 7

This industry practice of purchase and sale is referred to as “arbitrage.”* Arbitrage in the
form of simultaneous sales and purchases of electricity by self-generators occurs
because the market price for biomass-based green electricity has at times been
significantly higher than the embedded cost rates that electricity utilities in British
Columbia charge their industrial customers, as these utilities benefit from relatively

low-cost hydroelectric generating stations installed many decades ago.”

Through actions taken in 2009 by the BCUC, with the involvement of the BC Hydro and
Power Authority, a British Columbia state-owned electricity utility and state enterprise
(“BC Hydro”), the Province has denied Celgar all access to electricity from its local

utility, FortisBC, at embedded cost rates when Celgar is selling electricity.'°

BCUC Order G-48-09: In May 2009, the BCUC issued Order G-48-09, which
effectively prohibited FortisBC from providing embedded cost electricity to self-
generators in its service territory whilst they were selling electricity, except on a “net-
of-load” basis.!! Under such Order, Celgar had first to use its self-generated electricity
to meet its own load prior to selling electricity to third parties (a requirement referred to
as “net-of-load”).'? In other words, Celgar could sell only that part of its self-generated
electricity that exceeded its own load, thereby compelling Celgar to use first its own self-

generated electricity unless and until its own load was met.

Celgar’s GBL: Consistent with this net-of-load standard, as part of its process for
entering into an electricity purchase agreement (“EPA”) with Celgar in January 2009, 3

BC Hydro determined and fixed what it terms Celgar’s “generator baseline,” at the level

from unequal prices is commonly referred to as ‘arbitrage.””).

of Celgar’s 2007 load. The BCUC then approved and made effective the EPA

containing this generator baseline in June 2009. '*

A “generator baseline” (or “GBL”) is a term used by BC Hydro for electricity purchase
contracts with self-generators, at the express direction of the BCUC, to delineate the
level of self-generated electricity a customer must use to self-supply its own load and
below which it cannot sell to any person or entity.!> The GBL also defines the level of
access the customer will have to embedded cost energy from its utility to meet its load.
This level is equal to its own load minus its GBL.'® With its GBL set by BC Hydro and
the BCUC at the level of its 2007 load, Celgar, since 2009, has been afforded no access

to embedded cost electricity from its utility while selling electricity. !”

The practical effect of these two direct regulatory restrictions on access to embedded
cost utility power (the BCUC’s Order G-48-09 and the BC Hydro-set GBL, together and
separately) is to prohibit Celgar from selling its biomass-based green energy and
realising revenues from commercial sales of this valuable, premium energy service,
unless it is “net-of-load” electricity; i.e. electricity it generates over and above its 2007

load.'®

This “net-of-load” standard to which the Province and BC Hydro have held Celgar
constitutes treatment less favourable than that which the Province affords Canadian-
owned and third-country owned pulp mills with self-generation capacity that also are
selling electricity.'? Within the same political jurisdiction, and under the province-wide
authority of the BCUC, the Province permits these comparable mills to maintain access
to embedded cost utility electricity while they sell a significant portion of their self-
generated “below-load” electricity.” In other words, these other mills are permitted to
engage in arbitrage by purchasing some amount of utility electricity at low, embedded
cost rates for their pulp manufacturing operations, whilst simultaneously selling some

of their self-generated, “below-load” electricity at the higher, market-based rates

obtainable for biomass-based green energy. These comparable pulp mills profit from

such arbitrage.”!

No BC pulp mill other than Celgar that is selling its self-generated electricity is held to
a net-of-load standard, and thereby denied all access to embedded cost utility power

whilst selling self-generated electricity.7?

BCUC Order G-38-01: Instead, under a distinct BCUC Order issued in 2001, Order G-
38-01, the Province applies a “historical usage” standard to these other mills, directing
BC Hydro to define each mill’s GBL based on the amount of self-generated electricity

that the respective mill historically used to meet its own load.”

As examples, under this less-restrictive standard, the Province permits Howe Sound’s
Port Mellon pulp mill to arbitrage over | of its below-load electricity; and
Tembec’s Skookumchuck pulp mill may arbitrage over a. its below-load

electricity.*4 For Celgar, the comparable percentage is zero.7>

On 23 November 2013, the BCUC ruled that it was “unduly discriminatory” for a utility
to hold one self-generation customer to a net-of-load standard and another to a GBL
computed on the basis of historical usage.”° It is likewise “treatment less favourable”
under NAFTA for the Province to hold Celgar to a net-of-load standard while applying
to all other pulp mills a historical usage baseline methodology, which affords them
access to embedded cost utility electricity to facilitate some below-load electricity

sales.?7

Celgar is the only pulp mill with self-generation concerning which the Province has
taken regulatory action to limit the mill’s access to embedded cost utility electricity
whilst it is selling self-generated electricity.?* Other pulp mills have lower relative GBLs
compared to their generation or load, enabling them to access utility electricity and thus
sell more below-load electricity than Celgar (which can sell none). Also, most of these

other mills agreed voluntarily to use some of their self-generated energy to meet a

portion of their own load, often in exchange for compensation from BC Hydro.”? In
particular, BC Hydro contributed funds | each toward the
construction or financing of new generation at other mills, or provided other
consideration, in exchange for the mills agreeing to meet a portion of their load with
self-generated electricity and thereby “displace” electricity BC Hydro otherwise would
have had to supply to the mills. In industry parlance, these are known as “load

displacement” agreements (“LDAs”).?°

Celgar obtained no such consideration from BC Hydro or any other Provincial
instrumentality. Celgar never voluntarily agreed to use its self-generated electricity to
displace some or all of its own load.*! The Province, by regulatory action and without
compensation, is thus forcing Celgar to use its self-generated electricity to displace its

own load, whereas BC Hydro has provided valuable consideration to others to do so.**

The Respondent is responsible under NAFTA for the actions of its Province, British
Columbia and the BCUC. The Respondent has therefore breached Articles 1102 and
1103 of NAFTA, by according to the Claimant and its investments less favourable
treatment than it has accorded to Canadian investors and third-country investors and their

investments in like circumstances in British Columbia.**

The Respondent is obligated under NAFTA Chapter 15 to ensure that its state
enterprises comply with the obligations of Article 1102 and 1103. The Respondent also
has breached NAFTA Article 1503(2) with respect to any measures imposed exclusively
by BC Hydro.**

In addition, the procedures and standards used by BC Hydro and the Province to
determine the amount of arbitrage that is permissible (or the amount of below-load self-
generated electricity that an industrial self-generator may sell at market rates and replace

with purchases from its utility at embedded cost rates) are not well-established or

transparent.”’ There is no statute governing this issue; nor has the Province adopted any

written regulations, policies, guidelines or procedures.*°

The BCUC has explicitly delegated the task of setting a GBL, and, correspondingly, the
degree of access a self-generator is afforded to embedded cost utility electricity to meet
the remainder of its load, to the Province’s utilities, and almost exclusively to BC Hydro,
because BC Hydro has purchased the vast majority of the energy sold by self-generators
in the province.*” Yet, when it made these GBL determinations, BC Hydro had no
written policies or procedures for determining generator baselines, no internal controls,
and no apparent mechanism for ensuring non-discriminatory treatment. Indeed, it issued
written guidelines for GBL determinations only in June 2012, long after it had set most

GBLs, and after the Claimant had filed its Notice of Claim under NAFTA Chapter 1 1.38

Yet, even these unapproved, post-hoc guidelines are too vague to enable the calculation
of a GBL or to explain or validate past determinations that BC Hydro has made. Indeed,
on 13 December 2013, the BCUC commented that BC Hydro’s guidelines “‘are fairly
general, subject to considerable interpretation, not necessarily transparent and have not

been approved by the Commission.”*?

Further, BC Hydro has unfairly and arbitrarily used different historical baseline periods
for different mills, ignoring the cyclical nature of the pulp industry and changes over
time in other factors that affect the economics of self-generation.*” The duration of the
baseline period BC Hydro uses also varies from mill to mill, and even the basic
calculation methodology it applies has not on its face been consistent.*! BC Hydro has
revisited and amended baselines and baseline periods on an ad hoc basis.*” The BCUC
has then ratified BC Hydro’s GBL determinations by approving the Energy Purchase
Agreements (“EPAs”) in which they are embodied (although many have been exempted

from BCUC review).*

Further, BC Hydro routinely shields its determinations from public scrutiny and
comment through confidentiality agreements, such that no mill can ascertain any other
mill’s GBL or how it was computed.** It thus is impossible for any mill effectively to
argue to BC Hydro or to the BCUC that its treatment was unjust or discriminatory, to

the extent the Province even provides for BCUC review.*°

The whole process is rendered all the more unfair by the fact that BC Hydro is not a
disinterested regulator but is instead a financially self-interested party. In most cases, it
is either the purchaser of the self-generator’s power, or it agrees to sell the electricity
through its affiliated trading company, Powerex, and in all cases to date, except for

Celgar, it is the supplying utility.*°

In failing to provide reasons for its differences in treatment or any transparency in its
regulatory regime for industrial self-generators, particularly those like Celgar that are
not direct customers of BC Hydro, and through its arbitrary, discriminatory and unfair
actions that have denied Celgar regulatory fairness, the Respondent has also breached
its obligations under NAFTA Article 1105 (and Article 1503(2) with regard to the
conduct of BC Hydro) by failing to provide fair and equitable treatment in accordance

with the minimum standard.*”
The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent raises objections as to jurisdiction and admissibility to certain of the
Claimant’s claims. As to the merits, the Respondent denies any liability to the Claimant

on all the Claimant’s claims.

In summary, the Respondent contends that this arbitration arises out of the failure of the
Claimant’s plan to profit from low cost regulated rates for electricity in British
Columbia. In particular, the Claimant planned to have BC Hydro purchase its “self-
generated” energy without receiving anything in return. The Claimant referred to this
2748

plan as its “Arbitrage Project.” It also believed that its Celgar Mill was in a “unique

position to purchase more electricity from FortisBC, its local utility, at low-cost

regulated rates and then sell it on as if it were its own “self-generated” electricity to BC

Hydro or an imaginary U.S. buyer.”

None of the Claimant’s “self-generated” electricity would actually change hands in
these transactions. Rather, the Claimant intended “notionally” to purchase as much
electricity from FortisBC as was normally self-generated at the Celgar Mill. It would
then pretend that this electricity was its own “self-generated” electricity so that it could
sell it at a higher price. In reality, the Claimant’s self-generated electricity would
continue to serve its Mill, as it always had. This arbitrage of electricity was a simple

accounting transaction.*°

FortisBC was to obtain the additional electricity for this accounting transaction from its
supplier, BC Hydro, under the terms of a low-cost long-term power purchase agreement.
The Claimant then planned to buy this low-cost electricity from FortisBC and sell it
back, for more than three times the price, to BC Hydro as if it were the Claimant’s own
self-generated electricity. This elaborate buy-and-sell scheme would provide BC Hydro
with no new electricity and would ultimately have harmed both BC Hydro and its

ratepayers.*!

The Claimant was aware that it might not be able to persuade BC Hydro to purchase its
own electricity. Not to be dissuaded, the Claimant, having convinced FortisBC to
increase its purchases of low cost electricity from BC Hydro, hoped that it could instead
sell this electricity as its “self-generated” electricity for a profit in the USA. It was an
unlikely prospect at best given the lack of transmission capacity and the need to find a
purchaser in the USA willing to pay a premium for Canadian “self-generated” energy.
The Claimant, however, stood to profit from the difference between the price for BC

Hydro’s low-cost electricity and prevailing electricity prices in the USA.**

and selling the low cost electricity it purchased from BC Hydro. It also knew that the
BCUC had prohibited the arbitrage of BC Hydro’s low cost electricity in Order G-38-
01 as it could harm BC Hydro’s ratepayers.** It was even advised by FortisBC that the
contract the Claimant and FortisBC had negotiated to facilitate its plan to arbitrage low-

cost power stood a 50 per cent chance of being rejected by the BCUC.*°

Nor would the Arbitrage Project have somehow “leveled the playing field” between
B.C. pulp mills. Quite the opposite in fact: if the Claimant had managed to pull off this
scheme; it would have received far better treatment than any other BC pulp mill. Having
failed to reshape BC’s regulatory landscape and energy policy to its own advantage, the

Claimant now seeks the same preferential treatment in this NAFTA arbitration.*°

Celgar has, by all accounts, been a very successful participant in BC Hydro’s
procurement processes. In fact, Celgar has received the same treatment from BC Hydro
as other self-generating customers of BC Hydro, regardless of the fact that it was not a
customer of BC Hydro. BC Hydro has also offered many accommodations to Celgar, as

described below.*”

At the outset of the 2008 Bioenergy Call for Power, Celgar submitted two proposals to
BC Hydro. The Arbitrage Project, now renamed the “Biomass Realization Project” in
all correspondence with BC Hydro, was Celgar’s first proposal. The Green Energy
Project, through which Celgar offered to build a new additional condensing turbine at

its Celgar mill, was its second proposal.**

Upon receiving the “Biomass Realization Project” application, BC Hydro requested a
meeting with Celgar so as to better understand this project. Mr Merwin, Celgar’s
representative, described how BC Hydro saw the Celgar’s “Biomass Realization
Project” for what it really was: nothing more than exploiting the arbitrage of existing

power. He admitted in an internal email that: “[BC Hydro] do [es] not like the fact that

we would be buying power from Fortis who is buying power from them and we are

turning around and selling them the power.”°?

Not surprisingly, BC Hydro rejected Celgar’s “Biomass Realization Project.”

However, BC Hydro had no objection to Celgar’s “Green Energy Project” which would
provide BC Hydro with a new source of electricity. In reaching these conclusions, BC
Hydro offered Celgar the same treatment that it provided to all of the other proponents

in the Bioenergy Call.*!

Celgar was one of four proponents out of a total of thirteen to secure an EPA from the
Bioenergy Call for its Green Energy Project. °? BC Hydro requested detailed
information from Celgar which it employed to fix a GBL for Celgar of 40 MW using
the same methodology it used for every other self-generating pulp mill. BC Hydro
selected the Celgar’s Green Energy Project as it would supply new or “incremental”
electricity which met the terms of the Bioenergy Call — that is, additional generation
above what the pulp mill normally self-generated for its own consumption. This EPA,
together with an additional C$57.7 million subsidy Celgar received from the

Government of Canada® to build this condensing turbine, currently provides Celgar
with approximately [A in revenue per year.

BC Hydro applied the same considerations to Celgar’s “Biomass Realization Project”
(i.e., the Arbitrage Project) but found that this project was not eligible for the Bioenergy
Call as it would not provide BC Hydro with any new electricity. In essence, that project
would have required BC Hydro to purchase back its own electricity at great cost - a cost

that would have then been passed on to its ratepayers.°

Although BC Hydro had rejected its Arbitrage Project, Celgar almost immediately
entered into an agreement with FortisBC to achieve the same result. The arrangement

enabled Celgar to sell electricity FortisBC purchased from BC Hydro as its own “self-

generated” electricity. BC Hydro, after learning of this agreement, filed an application
with the BCUC requesting an amendment to its long-term power purchase agreement
with FortisBC, in order to prevent FortisBC from supplying BC Hydro’s energy to
customers that intended to use it for arbitrage. It did so because it was concerned that

Celgar’s Arbitrage Project would harm its ratepayers.

2.43 The BCUC considered the prohibition in this agreement against FortisBC arbitraging
BC Hydro’s low-cost electricity and observed that, when it was originally negotiated,
none of the parties could have foreseen that customers would have been able to arbitrage
electricity.©’ The BCUC also considered its previous regulatory decisions in Orders G-
38-01 and G-113-01 where it had found that arbitraging low-cost electricity in a manner
that would harm other ratepayers was unacceptable. Finally, it noted that both BC Hydro
and the BCUC staff had quantified the cost to BC Hydro’s ratepayers of allowing
FortisBC to supply this regulated low-cost energy for arbitrage at between C$12-16
million. Accordingly, the BCUC in Order G-48-09 approved BC Hydro’s request for an
amendment to the agreement and prohibited FortisBC from accessing BC Hydro’s low
cost energy for the purpose of supplying it to customers engaged in this form of harmful

arbitrage.°*

2.44 Celgar, however, remained intransigent, despite Order G-48-09 and would, in the
following years, repeatedly appear before the BCUC with new variations of its
“Arbitrage Project.” In these regulatory proceedings, Celgar would suggest that the
BCUC should force FortisBC to give the Celgar Mill a GBL of either 1.5 MW or 0 MW,
thus enabling Celgar to “notionally export” everything above this FortisBC GBL (and
below BC Hydro’s 40 MW GBL) to the USA. In trying to convince the BCUC, Celgar
lauded BC Hydro’s methodology for GBL determinations, but attempted to twist it ina
manner that would support its unreasonable request for a 1.5 MW GBL, a request based

on 15 year old data that would bear no resemblance to its current normal operations.’°

2.45 In subsequent BCUC proceedings, Celgar would eventually turn against its own utility,
FortisBC, shifting its position to demand that FortisBC supply Celgar with its own low-
cost electricity (excluding BC Hydro’s PPA electricity), which the Claimant would then
arbitrage. FortisBC, in response, raised the issue of potential harm to its ratepayers.
Celgar, predictably, took the position that any harm to other FortisBC ratepayers was
irrelevant and should not thwart its arbitrage plans.”! In other words, when it became
clear that Celgar would not be allowed to profit at the expense of BC Hydro’s ratepayers,

it decided to shift the burden to FortisBC and its smaller base of rural ratepayers.’

2.46 The BCUC repeatedly rejected the Claimant’s positions concerning its entitlement to
low-cost electricity. However, the BCUC directed FortisBC, in another regulatory
proceeding, to attempt to develop rates in a manner that would provide Celgar with

additional access to electricity without harming FortisBC’s other ratepayers.”

2.47 FortisBC complied with this direction, proposing a rate and a methodology that would
allow it to supply all of Celgar’s electricity by making matching purchases from the
US. electricity market. By sourcing the purchases from the USA, FortisBC could
address the BCUC’s concern that its customers would arbitrage BC Hydro’s power.
However, this proposal did not satisfy Celgar. The latter preferred to resell BC Hydro’s
or FortisBC’s low-cost electricity into the U.S. market as these regulated rates would

fluctuate less than corresponding market prices.”

2.48 Celgar, in pursuit of its arbitrage plans, would also adopt a practice of repeatedly
intervening in FortisBC’s regulatory proceedings. These repeated interventions, the cost
of which is borne in large part by FortisBC, have had the effect of fueling an annual

1.5% rate increase in FortisBC’s service area.’

To hide the underlying weakness of its claims and their complete disconnect from any
energy policy and procurement practice, the Claimant mischaracterizes the subject
matter of this arbitration by focusing on a single irrelevant metric of its own invention:
the “below load access percentage.” In doing so, the Claimant appears to suggest that a
provincial state enterprise must always procure the exact same percentage of a product
from all suppliers regardless of their relative size, the particularities of their business or,

perhaps most importantly, the amount of the product the supplier actually has for sale.”°

This assertion is untenable. It effectively amounts to a claim for a subsidy, an “access
percentage” subsidy. This “access percentage” subsidy would require BC Hydro to
purchase the same percentage of electricity from every pulp mill in the Province
regardless of whether these pulp mills have any new electricity for sale. Such a result
would be economically inefficient, contrary to good regulatory policy and detrimental

to all ratepayers in the Province.””

The Respondent considers the subject matter of this arbitration to be British Columbia’s
provincial energy policies, BC Hydro’s energy procurement practices and the BCUC’s
regulation of the electricity sector. In particular, certain energy policies of the BC
Government have had a direct effect on BC Hydro’s procurement of electricity. For
example, the 2007 Energy Plan and resulting Clean Energy Act’® directed BC Hydro to
acquire additional electricity from BC clean or renewable sources so as to become self-
sufficient by 2016. BC Hydro’s long-term electricity is similarly central to this case.
Notably, in planning to meet its self-sufficiency objective, BC Hydro chose to
incentivise and procure additional electricity from biomass producers, including pulp
mills, through the Bioenergy Call for Power Phase I, bilateral negotiations and the
Integrated Power Offer. Also crucial to this case is the BCUC’s regulation of the
electricity sector, including the relationship between BC Hydro and FortisBC with

respect to the provision of electricity under the PPA.”

The Claimant, broadly speaking, alleges that two measures are inconsistent with
NAFTA. First, it asserts that BC Hydro set the GBL under the Claimant’s EPA in a

manner that was discriminatory, non-transparent and arbitrary. The GBL is used to

demark the electricity that a mill generates for self-supply in normal operating conditions
from the “incremental” or “new” energy that BC Hydro can incentivise and procure. The
Claimant alleges that BC Hydro set the GBL for the Claimant’s EPA using a different

methodology than for other mills.°°

Second, the Claimant alleges that BCUC Order G-48-09 imposed a “net of load”
standard on the Claimant pursuant to which the Claimant can only sell its self-generated
electricity to a third party once it has fully met its electricity needs. The Claimant argues
that other mills have the right to sell to third parties below their loads and that the BCUC

has therefore acted in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner.*!

These claims should be rejected not only because they lack merit, but also on the basis
that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over claims directed at BC Hydro’s setting of the

GBL.”

The setting of the GBL is outside the scope of NAFTA because it was not an exercise
of governmental authority. Rather, BC Hydro sets a GBL as part of its contractual
negotiations and for the procurement of electricity as this delineates the amount of
electricity it will be willing to purchase. The procurement of electricity from private
sector biomass producers pursuant to a competitive bidding process is a commercial
enterprise that falls outside the ambit of NAFTA Article 1503(2) (on State

Enterprises).*?

Further, the limitation period for some of the claims directed at the setting of the GBL
has expired. The GBL determination occurred well before the three-year limitation
period set out in NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2). The Claimant’s GBL was set
on 30 May 2008 and accepted by the Claimant on 10 June 2008. The Claimant thus had
three years from the later date to submit a claim; i.e. by 10 June 2011. The Claimant,
however, waited until 30 April 2012; and it is therefore time-barred. Even the full EPA,
of which the GBL became a contractual term, was executed outside of this limitation

period, namely on 27 January 2009.**

Even if the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear these claims (which the Respondent denies),
the Claimant has failed to show that any of the alleged measures breached Canada’s

obligations under NAFTA for the reasons set out below.*>

First, the Respondent does not have any obligations under NAFTA Articles 1102 or 1103
with respect to the Claimant’s GBL which was set to determine the amount of electricity
BC Hydro would purchase pursuant to an EPA. NAFTA Article 1108 sets out an

exemption for procurement by state enterprises from Articles 1102 and 1103.°°

Second, even if the Tribunal were to consider the alleged breaches of NAFTA Articles
1102 and 1103, the Claimant’s allegations have no merit. As discussed above, the
Claimant bases its entire case on its claim that it is entitled to an “access percentage”
subsidy. It ignores the economic and regulatory rationales that support the limits set on
the arbitraging of electricity. Seen in its full and proper context, BC Hydro applied
consistent, coherent and correct policies to all pulp mills, including the Claimant, based
on sound economic and regulatory principles, dealing with the arbitrage of regulated,
low-cost electricity. These policies required that BC Hydro issue incentives only to
increase generation resources and not in a way that would be economically
disadvantageous to BC Hydro ratepayers. No other pulp mill in the Province has been

provided this type of incentive without conforming to these policies.*”

The Claimant also ignores the fact that NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 are designed to
prohibit nationality-based discrimination against USA or Mexican investors in favour of
either Canadian or foreign third-party investors. The Claimant fundamentally
misconstrues these provisions when it argues that it need not prove that discrimination
was accorded on the basis of nationality. It is not surprising that the Claimant distorts
the meaning of Articles 1102 and 1103 in this way, given the obvious lack of any

nationality- based discrimination in this case.**

Third, the Respondent has also not violated any of its obligations under NAFTA Article
1105(1). The Claimant under this provision merely recycles the allegations it makes

under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103, arguing that the minimum standard of treatment

under customary international law includes protection against discrimination that is
broader than the obligations under Articles 1102 and 1103. This distorted interpretation
of Article 1105 would render Articles 1102 and 1103 ‘inutile’ and meaningless; and, in
any event, the allegations the Claimant makes under Article 1105 are baseless for the

reasons stated above.*?

Finally, even if this Tribunal were to find a breach of the Respondent’s obligations, the
Claimant’s damages are significantly inflated. As explained above, but for the two
measures at issue the Claimant is nonetheless bound to supply itself with electricity from
its own generation assets. The measures are therefore incapable of causing the Claimant
any loss. The Claimant also fails to proffer evidence of any “competitive disadvantage”
it has suffered as a result of the measures. Although the Claimant’s pleaded case is
littered with allegations of a loss of competitive advantage, it does not provide any

evidence to substantiate this claim.”

The Claimant’s quantification of damages is also inherently speculative. To make out
its case for damages, the Claimant assumes that BC Hydro would purchase all of
Celgar’s self-generated electricity. There is no evidence to support this assumption. Nor
did the Claimant provide any evidence of a third party that would purchase the
electricity at a price high enough to cover Celgar’s cost of purchasing the replacement
electricity from FortisBC. Even if such a willing third party existed, the Claimant has
not demonstrated how Celgar could deliver its self-generated electricity below load to
such a third party. For these reasons the Claimant’s quantification of damages is

unfounded.”!

This claim for an “access percentage” subsidy is a first for an arbitration under NAFTA
Chapter 11. Never has a respondent faced a claim from an investor over its entitlement
to a subsidy of its own creation. No doubt this is because no other claimant has been

brazen enough to advance such a claim.”

The Respondent concludes that Celgar attempted to arbitrage electricity so that it would

profit from the harm it caused to BC Hydro’s ratepayers. It then failed to persuade the

* Td., Paragraph 26.

BCUC that it should be allowed to cause the same harm to FortisBC’s ratepayers. Now,
the Claimant has brought a NAFTA Chapter 11 claim to shift the burden of Celgar’s
plans onto all Canadian taxpayers. The Claimant’s claims are devoid of legal merit.
They are frivolous. This Tribunal should dismiss all these claims and award full costs to

Canada for this arbitration.”

PART IT: THE PRINCIPAL FACTS

Introduction

It is necessary at the outset to set out the principal facts relevant to the Tribunal’s
reasons for its several decisions later in this Award, many of which are materially fact
specific or at least require factual explanations. Whilst there is much common ground
between the Parties as regards some of these facts, there remain significant differences.
Where factual references are made later in this document, these should be read with the
fuller account of those facts set out below, including their respective evidential

references.

The Tribunal emphasises that the following recites only its findings on the principal
facts relevant to this Award. It would burden this document unduly, even if it were
possible, for all potentially relevant factual evidence, documents and testimony to be
set out here in the fullest detail. Nonetheless, as with the Parties’ pleadings and
submissions, it should be assumed that the Tribunal has considered all relevant factual
evidence adduced by the Parties in this arbitration and, further, that no relevant evidence

has been overlooked by the Tribunal by reason only of its omission below.
The Parties and Associated Entities

The Claimant owns and operates a pulp mill in Castlegar, British Columbia (“BC” or
“the Province”), Canada (the “Celgar Mill” or “Mill’”) through its Canadian affiliates,
Zellstoff Celgar Limited and Zellstoff Celgar Limited Partnership (“ZCL and ZCLP”).
As already indicated, for ease of reference, save where the context requires otherwise,

the Tribunal refers to ZCL and ZCLP collectively as “Celgar”.

On 22 October 2004, the Claimant incorporated ZCL, a company incorporated in BC,

to act as the acquiring company for the purchase of the Celgar Mill.
On 14 February 2005, ZCL acquired the land and all the assets of the Celgar Mill.

On 10 January 2006, ZCL entered into a limited partnership agreement, with itself as

the general partner, to form ZCLP.

ZCL transferred the Celgar Mill to ZCLP on 1 March 2006. ZCL retained legal title to
the land, which it holds on trust for ZCLP. ZCL is the sole general partner, and receives
0.10 per cent of the partnership’s profits in consideration for acting as general partner.
The Claimant is the sole limited partner; and it owns 100 per cent of ZCLP’s capital

and receives 99.90 per cent of its profits.°*

The British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority (“BC Hydro”), is a provincial Crown
corporation in British Columbia. The Government of British Columbia (the “BC
Government”) is BC Hydro’s sole shareholder and appoints its Board of Directors and
Chair. BC Hydro reports to the BC Government through the Minister of Energy. BC
Hydro is the predominant electricity generator and distributor in the Province. In 1988,
BC Hydro established Powerex Corp. (“Powerex”), a wholly-owned power-trading

subsidiary.

An important exception to BC Hydro’s geographical coverage is the West Kootenay—
Okanagan region, located in the South Central portion of the Province. There FortisBC
Inc. (“FortisBC”) provides electricity services. FortisBC is a wholly-owned subsidiary

of Fortis Inc., a Canadian publicly listed distribution utility.

FortisBC acquires much of its electricity through long-term power-purchase contracts:
notably a Power Purchase Agreement with BC Hydro dated 1 October 1993 (the “1993
PPA”). FortisBC’s purchases of electricity under the 1993 PPA were subject to a
capacity limit of 200 MW. For service provided below this capacity limit, FortisBC
would purchase the electricity under Rate Schedule 3808. The arrangement between
BC Hydro and FortisBC was renewed with a PPA made in 2014 on materially similar
terms (the “2014 PPA”).

The only pulp mill in FortisBC’s electricity service territory is the Celgar Mill. All other

BC pulp mills are in BC Hydro’s service territory.

The British Columbia Utilities Commission (“the BCUC’”) is an independent regulatory
agency, operating under and administering the Utilities Commission Act (“UCA”).°>
Its primary responsibility is the supervision of BC’s public utilities, such as BC Hydro

and FortisBC. The UCA, section 43, enables the BCUC to require utilities to answer all

questions and provide all information deemed necessary for the purposes of
administering the UCA. The BCUC is responsible for supervising and regulating all
public utilities in BC, including both BC Hydro and FortisBC; and it has the power to

pass legally binding rulings and other measures.

The BC Government’s Ministry of Energy (the “MEM”) is responsible for BC’s

electricity policy and has certain powers under the UCA to that end.
The Regulatory History

On 12 October 1990, as part of a plan to expand the Celgar Mill, Celgar submitted an
Application for an Energy Project Certificate for a proposed 52 MW turbine to the
MEM. The Application explained that Celgar intended to operate, in normal conditions,
the steam generated with the new turbine to supply 100% of the modernized mill’s

electrical power requirements.”

The Ministers’ Order: On 23 May 1991, the BC Minister of Energy and the BC Minister
of the Environment issued a Ministers’ Order, which exempted Celgar’s installation of
its 52 MW turbine from provisions of the UCA subject to certain conditions, including
that: “Celgar shall [...], cause the Project to be designed, located, constructed and
operated in accordance with (a) the Application.”*’ (the “Ministers’ Order”). These
operating conditions included a commitment to use the new generator to self-supply

under normal operating conditions.

The Respondent accepts that the Ministers’ Order “didn’t come to light for many
years.”°* In particular, the order’s existence does not appear to have crossed the mind
of anyone at BC Hydro or the BCUC until this arbitration was commenced.
Nonetheless, the Claimant’s expert witness Mr Austin testified that, in in his view, the
Ministers’ Order remains in force; and the Tribunal, accepting his testimony and the
testimony to like effect of Mr Ostergaard (the Energy Ministry’ Assistant Deputy

Minister), so finds.”?

Nevertheless, given its other decisions in this Award, the Tribunal considers that it
would not be appropriate or material to take into account the Ministers’ order as a
decisive factor deciding the Parties’ dispute. Its terms are not free from ambiguity; and,
being long forgotten by the Respondent itself, its belated use by the Respondent as a
determining document in this arbitration adverse to the Claimant, would simply add

another issue for no practical purpose.

GBLs: The first occasion on which BC Hydro and the BCUC considered any form of
GBL related to Howe Sound’s application to sell its self-generated electricity into the
USA market in 2000-2001. BC Hydro raised concerns about this proposal at the time
with Howe Sound, by letter dated 12 February 2001:!°°

“[T]he management of BC Hydro... and most likely the government as its
shareholder, will have serious concerns about any potential proposal that will
see customer self-generated power sold into market, and with BC Hydro then
being required to supply make-up power under Schedule 1821. This will be
financially detrimental to BC Hydro and its other ratepayers, both in the short
and long term.”

BC Hydro did, however, recognise that if incremental power were to be sold to the

market, this would alleviate the concern: !°!

“If the situation were one in which incremental power would be made available
for sale in the market, i.e. power which is not now being produced but the
generation of which would be made attractive if it could be sold at market prices,
I expect that the situation (in BC Hydro’s view) would likely be different. Any
incremental power supply in the province, regardless of where it is being sold (in
the short term at least) would likely be viewed as positive.”
On 23 February 2001, BC Hydro wrote to the BCUC advising it that some of its
customers with self-generation capability wished to sell power they generated at market
prices to take advantage of new “Open Access” proposals allowing them to access a

utility’s transmission system with a view to selling on that electricity.

Subsequently, the BCUC issued Order G-38-01 on 5 April 2001.!°? It provided (inter

alia):

“The Commission directs B.C. Hydro to allow Rate Schedule 1821 customers
with idle self-generation capability to sell excess self-generated electricity,
provided the self-generating customers do not arbitrage between embedded cost
utility service and market prices. This means that B.C. Hydro is not required to
supply any increased embedded cost of service to a RS 1821 customer selling its
self-generation output to market. The Commission recognizes that considerable
debate may ensue over whether a self-generator has met this principle, but the
Commission expects B.C. Hydro to make every effort to agree on a customer
baseline, based either on the historical energy consumption of the customer or
the historical output of the generator. In instances where the parties cannot agree
on an appropriate baseline, an affidavit may be required from the self-generator
that it will not adjust its consumption of electricity under Rate Schedule 1821 to
take advantage of market sales from its self-generation.”

Accordingly, BCUC Order G-38-01 directed BC Hydro to allow relevant customers
with idle self-generation capability to sell excess self-generated electricity, provided
those customers did not arbitrage between embedded-cost utility service and market
prices. To that end, the BCUC further stated that it expected BC Hydro to make every
effort to agree on a customer baseline, based either on the historical energy
consumption of the customer or the historical output of the generator. This baseline was
to be agreed with any customer that wished to increase its electricity generation. Despite
the initially temporary nature of Order G-38-01, it was then extended until the BCUC
should determine otherwise, by Order G-17-02.

Next, in 2002, the BC Ministry of Energy issued its 2002 Energy Plan.'°? Pursuant to
that Plan, BC Hydro, on 2 September 2002, issued a Customer-Based Generation Call
for Power with the aim of obtaining attractively priced electricity under long-term
agreements from non-utility generation to meet BC Hydro’s future demand. BC Hydro

explained in its Call For Tender documentation:

“As noted under Evaluation of Tenders and Prices/Award of EPAs, the proposed
electricity supply must be new or incremental. Where the bidder’s project involves
an increase in the capacity of, or energy from, existing facilities resulting from
capital modifications, it is necessary to determine the generator’s historic
generation capability. The historic generation capability is referred to in the
Standard EPA as the Generator Baseline or ‘GBL’. For purposes of determining
electricity eligible for sale to BC Hydro, the GBL will be deducted from the

‘3 British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, Energy For Our Future: A Plan for BC
(“2002 Energy Plan”) [R-21].

metered electricity. Except in very limited circumstances as described in the

Standard EPA, BC Hydro will not purchase electricity that is part of the GBL.”
Accordingly, the proposed electricity supply had to be incremental, that is “electricity
from new generation facilities or from an increase in the capacity of, or energy from,
existing facilities resulting from capital modifications (other than normal capital
maintenance programs).”!°> BC Hydro further made the acquisition of self-generation
from customers in this call contingent upon the customer’s agreeing to a baseline that
was representative of its historical self-generation, which BC Hydro referred to as a

“generator baseline” or “GBL”.

A separate form entitled “2002 CBG Generator Baseline (GBL) Application” was
annexed to the document. It was there envisaged that the GBL would be established
through a negotiation between BC Hydro and the customer. The following information

was required from the customer for this purpose: !°°

“The nameplate capacities will be used to determine the Generator Baseline,
unless the bidder submits information acceptable to BC Hydro as to why the
Generator Baseline should be less than nameplate capacities. Such a submission
must include at least the following:

* historical operating data for each electric generator in MWh as a daily average
listed by month for a minimum of 3 years, or the total length of time the Generator
has been installed and operating whichever is less, and

* the peak output for each month for each electric generator in the last 10 years
or the period in which the generator has been installed whichever is less.”

No self-generator was ultimately awarded a contract under this Call for Power.!°7

The Respondent accepted that this GBL served as the dividing line between “pre-
existing” and “new” or “incremental” energy', as did its factual witness Mr Dyck in

cross-examination.!° The Tribunal so finds.

There is a dispute between the Parties whether the concept of a GBL was a single
concept or whether it in fact referred to one or other of two quite different matters,

depending on context: namely, a “service GBL” or a “procurement GBL”. The former

defines the scope of a utility’s obligation to serve and the latter defines the level above
which it will procure electricity. This distinction had at most been hinted at in the
Respondent’s written pleadings.''° At the Hearing, however, the Respondent’s witness,
Mr Dyck (of BC Hydro), positively asserted that “BC Hydro’s use of a GBL in an EPA

with a self-generator is not connected to its obligations to serve its customers.”!!!

The Tribunal disagrees with this testimony. It finds, on the contemporaneous
documents, that the GBL is a composite concept fixing at a single value both the limit
of BC Hydro’s obligation to serve and the level above which it will procure electricity.
That was expressly stated by the BCUC on 25 June 2014 in the reasons accompanying
its Order G-106-14: “Because these self-generators are selling to BC Hydro, a GBL in
these cases has a dual purpose. On the one hand, it is used to establish BC Hydro’s
obligation to serve under RS 1823 (Order G-38-01) and on the other hand, it identifies
how much idle self-generation is available for BC Hydro to purchase under an EPA. As
pointed out by Celgar in its submission [to the BCUC], these two amounts are aligned;
and there is in fact only one GBL. This issue is analogous to two sides of the same
coin.”!!? As a general concept, the Tribunal does not think it material to distinguish
between its application to BC Hydro’s obligation as a utility to serve its own customers
directly and BC Hydro’s indirect obligation as a utility to serve FortisBC’s customers,

including (particularly) Celgar.

Accordingly, as regards the BCUC’s reasons cited above, the Tribunal does not accept
the Respondent’s explanation in its closing submissions that this was “a little bit of
loose language”.''? In its reasons, the BCUC confirmed that the function of
demarcating a utility’s obligation to serve is one purpose, albeit noting also in Appendix
A to its Order G-191-13, that “a GBL [represents] in its most basic form the load a self-

generator is required to serve”.''* These are clearly distinct purposes.

As explained by the Respondent in its closing submissions in regard to the second of
these purposes, the GBL “defines the line above which BC Hydro will procure from

the Claimant. If they have a lower GBL, BC Hydro will procure more. That is the very

400 Tt appears, if at all, in Resp. Rej., Paragraphs 273, 278.

purpose of the GBL.” (emphasis here supplied).!!> This is confirmed by the testimony
of the Respondent’s witness, Mr Scouras (of BC Hydro), that once the GBL is

identified, BC Hydro simply “purchase[s] what is in excess of that” [GBL].!'°

Whilst there is a dispute about whether G-38-01 bound BC Hydro as such, the
Respondent’s case is that BC Hydro did in fact set GBLs “in accordance with G-38-
017!” and “based on the principles set out in BCUC Order G-38-01”.!'® The Tribunal

so finds.

Ultimately, the 2002 Customer-Based Generation call resulted in only three Energy
Purchase Agreements (“EPAs”), none of which dealt with incremental self-

generation. !!°

Shortly afterwards, in November 2002, the BC Government issued its 2002 Energy
Plan with the aim of ensuring low electricity prices and public ownership of BC Hydro;
a secure, reliable supply of energy; more private sector opportunities; and
environmental responsibility with a guarantee of no nuclear generation in the Province.
The 2002 Energy Plan was to be the foundation for establishing an overarching
“Heritage Contract” aimed at preserving the benefit of BC Hydro’s existing “heritage”
generation assets. The Heritage Contract was to be implemented through legislation

and “lock in the value of existing low-cost generation assets for an extended period.”

In 2003, on the BCUC’s recommendation, the BC Government enacted the BC Hydro
Public Power Legacy and Heritage Contract Act and Heritage Special Direction No.
HC2. These measures prohibited the sale of BC Hydro’s generation assets and provided
that the benefits of low cost generation from BC Hydro’s historic assets would continue
to be available to ratepayers. (The BC Hydro hydroelectric system and storage
reservoirs were built in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.)

On 16 February 2005, the Claimant (by its attorneys who represent it as co-counsel in
this arbitration) wrote to the Executive Director of the Environmental Assessment

Office, in the Office of the BC Deputy Minister, to request an amendment to the

Ministers’ order to reflect ZCL’s acquisition of the Celgar Mill.'?° The request was
granted, by letter dated 2 March 2005, making ZCL responsible for Celgar’s
compliance with the Ministers’ order. '*! (This is not the same Ministers’ Order of 23

May 1991 described above.)

On 27 February 2007, the BC Government released an energy plan entitled “The BC
Energy Plan: A Vision for Clean Energy Leadership” (the “2007 Energy Plan”).!? It
aimed, amongst other things, to ensure that the Province achieved self-sufficiency of
electricity supply by 2016, and that the Province maintained its competitive electricity
rate advantage. Policy Action No. 30 of the 2007 Energy Plan set out a bioenergy
strategy to increase biomass electricity, or “bioenergy”, generating capacity in the
Province, since biomass energy was considered carbon-neutral. Bioenergy includes

energy generated by pulp mills such as the Celgar Mill.

The 2007 Energy Plan directed BC Hydro to issue an expression of interest, followed
by a call for proposals, for electricity from sawmill residues, logging debris and timber
killed by the mountain pine beetle infesting British Columbia forests. The 2007 Energy
Plan also established a “Standing Offer” program (“SOP”) with a set purchase price for

projects up to 10 MW.

Pursuant to the 2007 Energy Plan, BC Hydro issued its Request for Proposals for its
Bioenergy Call for Power on 6 February 2008.'” The timetable in this Request for
Proposals envisaged that the customer would submit GBL data on 7 March 2008 and
that BC Hydro would give notice to the customer of the GBL on 2 May 2008. The

following type of project was among those considered to be eligible: !74

“New Self-generation, or incremental self-generation, in any event excess of the
Customer’s GBL at a Customer’s facility to serve the Customer’s industrial load
at the facility (i.e. load displacement) and/or effect net energy export to the System
(i.e. Customer Projects), but excluding generation projects, where the current
output is under contract through a load displacement or demand side
management agreement with BC Hdyro [sic].”

* The purpose of the GBL is to define incremental generator output that can be

considered for a prospective energy sale

* Each customer, including all customer owned and operated generators behind

the point of interconnection will need to have GBL set for their project

* For transmission voltage connected customers with multiple generators a GBL

will need to be set for all generations

* The initial customers’ ‘estimated GBLs’ should reflect a 365 day annual period

* The GBL start point is the same as the GBL establishment year

“Incremental Generation

* Requires historical data from existing generators proximal to the proposed
generator (i.e. same facility).

* Requires future biomass utilization forecasts up to your GBL if current
customer, or to your existing annual generation if not a customer.

*Requires future incremental biomass requirements.”

The process for establishing the GBL was described as follows: !78

“GBL Determination Process
* GBL discussions and determinations will follow the same process as the initial
CBL discussions.
* Individual meetings will be conducted between the customer proponents and a
BC Hydro GBL review team in the next few weeks.
*Once GBLs have been agreed to with the review team they will be filed along
with the individual customer GBL statements and ultimately filed with the BCUC.
* After GBLs have been determined and expected generation operations are
defined (relative to BC Hydro energy sales to customers), both planning for
metering configurations and billing system programming can begin”
BC Hydro received 20 proposals from 13 different customers; but it ultimately decided

earlier and based on Celgar’s generation levels in 200: Mr Merwin’s proposal to

BC Hydro concerning Celgar’s GBL contained the following information: '*°

“Historically, under normal operating conditions Celgar’s load was 38 MW to
39 MW. In 2007, Celgar’s load under normal operating conditions was 43 MW,
depending on whether Celgar’s chipping plant is running this number could go
as high as 45 MW. During less than ideal operating conditions the mill load would
likely be a slightly lower number. As Celgar moves to a higher reliability,
meaning running at target rates, there will be a higher frequency when Celgar’s
load is equal or greater than 43 MW.”

Mr Dyck (who was the person responsible at BC Hydro for setting Celgar’s GBL)
testified to the effect that:'*° BC Hydro’s policy was to set a GBL to reflect a one-year
period; he nonetheless considered all the data that BC Hydro received from Celgar for
the period 2002-2007; he disregarded the data from 2002-2004 as that reflected a period
when the Mill was in bankruptcy; he examined the data from 2005 and 2006, but he did
not consider that this reflected normal operations for the Mill in 2008 given that these

preceded the extensive improvements made during ‘Project Blue Goose’.

Ultimately, by letter dated 30 May 2008 to Celgar, Mr Dyck set Celgar’s annual GBL
at 349 GWh/year (or 40 MW).!97

BC Hydro and Celgar signed their EPA on 27 January 2009, together with the Side

of GBL’s. Attachment A to this letter identifies several questions related to the
determination of GBL’s, and the Commission requests that BC Hydro address
these questions when it submits the draft GBL Guidelines and related discussion.

The Attachment listed twenty questions for BC Hydro.

On 20 June 2012, BC Hydro filed a GBL Information Report with the BCUC, reflecting
its established business practices.'*? That Information Report stated (at pages 14—
15);140

“In the EPA, the customer will be contractually obligated to generate an amount
in excess of the GBL for each year ... To meet this obligation, the customer must
first generate the GBL for self-supply. This is a benefit ... since there is value to
BC Hydro given that the customer’s self-supply commitment in the contract
removes the uncertainty associated with serving customer load for resource
planning purposes.”
This Information Report, which also set out BC Hydro’s detailed representations as to
how it calculated GBLs, was provided to the Claimant for the first time during this
arbitration. The Respondent submits that this document was not the first to set out in
writing BC Hydro’s approach to determining GBLs. On the materials provided to this

Tribunal, this submission would be largely correct: see above.

On 13 December 2013, in its letter to BC Hydro, the BCUC described BC Hydro’s
guidelines for calculating GBLs (as described in the Information Report) as “fairly
general, subject to considerable interpretation, not necessarily transparent and ... not

approved by the Commission”. '*!

The Tribunal agrees with this criticism of BC Hydro’s methodology. In particular, both
the approach set out in the Information Report and the explanation of its rationale are
at times difficult to follow, even with the assistance of the Parties’ expert witnesses and

Counsel at the Hearing many years later.

The Information Report acknowledged (on page 10) that GBLs were to be at least
consistent with Order G-38-01: “For the EPAs having GBLs that BC Hydro has signed

with customers since 2009, BC Hydro has established a GBL for each customer,
consistent with the principles, process and considerations set out in section 4.1 of this
Information Report. The overriding purpose of these GBLs was to mitigate the risk of

arbitrage, consistent with BCUC Order No. G-38-01.”
The Information Report continues (on page 11):

“A GBL is not the only means of mitigating the risk of arbitrage. Another method
has been referred to as ‘net-of-load’. In Letter No. L-106-09, the BCUC asked
several questions of BC Hydro about the net-of-load approach, including the
advantages and disadvantages of using this method.

Under a net-of-load approach, a customer would not be able to sell self-generated
electricity unless the customer first displaces its entire load at its own cost. By
definition, there would be no risk of arbitrage under a net-of-load regime because
a customer simply would not be allowed to buy electricity from BC Hydro at the
same time that it is selling its self-generated electricity to BC Hydro or others.
There are advantages to the net-of-load approach. In addition to avoiding the risk
of arbitrage, the net-of-load approach removes the need to consider historical
generation because it is based on what the customer is actually generating (and

delivering to the grid) on a real-time basis ...”.'

The Information Report explains (on page 14), how GBLs that form part of negotiated

contracts are arrived at:

“First, BC Hydro and the customer establish a baseline (the contracted GBL)
that reflects 365 days of generation output for self-supply. The annual GBL is
determined, in consultation with the customer, using the best available
information including the customer's historical self-generation output and energy
consumption data, and information about the customer's unique manufacturing
process. The annual GBL represents a reasonable estimate of the annual self-
generated energy normally used by the customer for self-supply under current

conditions and in the absence of a contract.” 8

Celgar, in an earlier document submitted to the BCUC on 15 April 2010, had asserted
that, “[t]he determination of the GBL should be made in consideration of the customer

circumstances.” !4

“Regardless of the differences between customers and power procurement
processes, the objective of the contracted GBL determination process is always
the same; namely, to determine the annual self-generated energy used by the
customer for self-supply, in the absence of a contract, in a normal current
operating year, as of the time period the EPA is negotiated.” !*°

This “current normal” approach was confirmed in the testimony of the Respondent’s

witness, Mr Dyck (of BC Hydro), on BC Hydro’s approach to setting GBLs.'*°

This relatively detailed description of BC Hydro’s methodology forms an important
background to the Parties’ dispute. This methodology was much criticised by the
Claimant as retrospective, with no coherent or consistent methodology having been in
place at the time when Celgar’s GBL was fixed. Whilst there is some force in such
criticism, for the reasons set out later in this Award, the Tribunal does not find it

necessary to address further the factual evidence on the regulatory history beyond 2013.
Celgar’s Infrastructure Investment

The Celgar Mill, like many pulp mills, produces pulp whilst at the same time generating
electricity as both a means to and by-product of doing so. It is not in dispute that it is
not economical for the Celgar Mill (or pulp mills generally) to produce electricity
otherwise than whilst producing pulp. For present purposes, the specifics of the process
by which pulp and electricity are produced in combination are not relevant. What is

relevant is that it is a process in BC peculiar to pulp mills.

Whether a pulp mill produces enough electricity to meet its pulp-making needs varies
from pulp mill to pulp mill. If the mill does not produce enough electricity to meet its
needs (referred to as its “load”), it must buy electricity from elsewhere, most naturally
from its local utility. If, on the other hand, it produces more electricity than its load, it
may seek to sell that electricity to its utility or to third parties. A crucial point is that a
pulp mill may be able to buy electricity at a price lower than that at which it can sell it,
making it economical to buy electricity with the aim of selling on the same amount. As
already noted above, this is called “arbitrage”. A pulp mill’s ability successfully to
arbitrage thus clearly depends on the terms, if any, on which it can both buy and sell

electricity. It may be economical for a pulp mill to engage in arbitrage below its load if

it can acquire electricity cheaply enough to meet that load. It also depends on the
equipment and processes in place at the pulp mill, including investments thought likely

to yield better opportunities for arbitrage.

In anticipation of its acquisition of the Celgar Mill in 2005, Celgar devised a project to
increase its production of both pulp and electricity by installing new infrastructure. This
was referred to as “Project Blue Goose”. The new infrastructure was installed in April
2007 and brought online over the succeeding months.'*’ As a result of Project Blue
Goose, the Celgar Mill’s electricity generation increased over 20 per cent, from 290.4
GWh/year in 2006 to 350.6 GWh/year in 2007. As a corollary of this increase, the
Celgar Mill’s electricity requirement from FortisBC fell from an average of 54.1

GWh/year between 1996 and 2006 to 22.6 GWh/year in 2007.'*8

This enabled Celgar to enter into a series of agreements with the aim of maximising its
investments from the sale of electricity, including a Transmission Agreement of July
2006 with FortisBC, '*? an Agreement of July 2006 with NorthPoint,!°° and a Brokerage
Agreement of October 2006 with FortisBC. '*!

On 6 June 2007, Celgar signed a non-disclosure agreement with FortisBC to facilitate

discussions about FortisBC’s interest in purchasing more of Celgar’s self-generated

clecticity, inc Err
FY the discussions shifted to the possibility of FortisBC’s supplying

Celgar with electricity to meet its full load requirements whilst Celgar simultaneously
sold the output of its two generators to third parties.'*? Celgar called this proposal its

“Arbitrage Project”.

As already set out above, on 6 February 2008, in accordance with the 2007 Energy Plan,
BC Hydro issued its first call for bioenergy power proposals known as “Bioenergy

Power Call Phase I”.'°+

On 4 May 2008, during Celgar’s negotiations with BC Hydro, Mr Merwin (of Celgar)
wrote internally to his colleague, Mr McLaren, about Celgar’s expectations and

strategy:

“It appears BC Hydro has formally come out against our arbitrage project. I
think there is still an opportunity with them as they have a fair bit of arrogance
that they are the option for us and it won't stop us. I have spent some time this
weekend drafting a response letter as we need to get our GBL set in either case
as we need it so that we can submit our bid. It still needs some editting [sic]. I
would like you to take a quick look at it when you get a chance on Monday
morning and offer comment if my analysis on the mill data seems plausible to
you.” 155

Mr McLaren replied to Mr Merwin the same day:

“If we can't break the BC Hydro position that the existing TG GBL portion is
ineligible [TG = Turbine Generator], then we must fight to establish our GBL to
be as low as is credible - I support your logic of picking a GBL of 33 MW to
reflect conditions prior to Mercer's energy investments.” °°
(On the basis set out in Celgar’s draft letter to BC Hydro, that the Celgar Mill would
operate for 8,400 hours a year, 33 MW was equivalent to approximately 277
GWh/year.)

Celgar was ultimately successful under the call, the most significant condition of its
success being BC Hydro’s assignment to it, on 30 May 2008, of a GBL of 349
GWh/year. It is not disputed that this was essentially equivalent to the Celgar Mill’s
load for 2007 (with Project Blue Goose completed). !°’

On 7 June 2008 Mr Merwin wrote in an internal memorandum within Celgar: “We are

currently debating our GBL with Hydro as we believe they have not treated assignment

of this number the same as what they have done for other pulp and paper mills.”!*

Nonetheless, despite Mr Merwin’s ‘belief’, the Respondent’s witness, Mr Dyck (of BC
Hydro), accepts (and his evidence was not contradicted) that Celgar was not provided
with any substantial information as to BC Hydro’s fixing of any other pulp or paper

mill’s GBL until this arbitration was commenced.'?

As a next stage of its infrastructure investment, Celgar had envisaged a “Green Energy
Project” entailing the installation of an additional 48 MW condensing turbine (along
with other energy-related upgrades) that would use the Celgar Mill’s surplus steam to
generate additional new electricity. However, the subsequent 2008-09 global economic
crisis resulted in that project being postponed until sufficient funding became available
for it. This ultimately came, first, in the form of a C$ 57.7 million credit under the Pulp
and Paper Green Transformation Program (“PPGTP”) announced by the Government
of Canada in June 2009. Then, in November 2009, Celgar entered into a non-repayable
Contribution Agreement with Natural Resources Canada, whereby Natural Resources
Canada agreed to provide approximately C$ 40.0 million in grants towards certain costs

of the Green Energy Project.

Celgar ultimately completed the Green Energy Project in September 2010. It cost C$

64 million, of which the Canadian Government provided C$ 46.8 million.
Celgar’s 2009 EPA and the Side Letter

Following Celgar’s success in the Bioenergy Phase I Call for Power, Celgar (as seller)
and BC Hydro (as buyer) began to negotiate and eventually agreed an EPA for a ten
year period (“the 2009 EPA”).

During negotiations for the EPA, Celgar had sought to agree with BC Hydro that it
would be allowed to sell any below-GBL power to third parties. Although apparently
open to this proposal at first, BC Hydro ultimately refused to accede to it as a term of

the EPA.

Instead, as signed on 27 January 2009, the 2009 EPA contained at clause 7.4 an

“Exclusivity Provision” to the effect that Celgar was prohibited from selling below-

PUBLIC VERSION

GBL power to third parties.'°° The Respondent’s position was that every EPA

concluded by BC Hydro with a pulp mill includes an equivalent of this Exclusivity

Provision. !*!

3.78 Conversely, the 2009 EPA provided by clause 7.3 to the effect that BC Hydro was
obliged to buy all electricity produced by Celgar above its GBL.'® This is consistent

with one of the two purposes of a GBL as identified by the Tribunal above.

3.79 On 27 January 2009 (the date the 2009 EPA was signed by the Parties), Celgar, being
dissatisfied with the Exclusivity Provision, sought and obtained an agreement from BC
Hydro in the form of a “Side Letter’ whereby (inter alia) the offending part of the
Exclusivity Provision would be removed if Celgar obtained an order from the BCUC

allowing it access to utility power other than on a net-of-load basis.'®
3.80 This Side Letter provided, in material part as follows:

“1. The inclusion of section 7.4(b) in the EPA in its present form, and the support
of the Parties for the EPA in any proceeding (the "section 71 proceeding") arising
from the filing of the EPA with the BCUC under section 71 of the UCA, are
without prejudice to the right of (i) the Seller to take a position in any other
pending or future regulatory proceeding before the BCUC, the effect of which if
such position were to prevail in that proceeding, would be that (A) FortisBC may
supply electricity to the Seller to serve the Seller's Mill Load, in circumstances
where the Seller sells self-generated electricity diverted from serving Mill Load,
(B) the Seller may sell such self-generated electricity in those circumstances, and
(C) section 7 4(b) of the EPA in its present form should have no force or effect,
and (ii) BC Hydro to take a contrary position. For certainty, the Seller
acknowledges that it will comply with section 3.3 of the EPA, and will not take
the position described in (i) above in the section 71 proceeding.

2. If the BCUC makes an order in any pending or future regulatory proceeding
upholding the position described in paragraph I(i) above, then subject to the

Party will exercise its right to terminate the EPA under section 3.1 in respect

condition are hereby waived by both Parties.

4. This letter may be filed by either Party with the BCUC or in evidence in any

On 31 July 2009, under section 71 of the UCA, the BCUC “accepted for filing” the
2009 EPA along with three other such agreements, apparently concluded between BC

Hydro and other parties.

There was some disagreement between the Parties as to when the 2009 EPA took effect:
in particular, whether it did so on 27 January 2009 (the “effective date” according to its
contractual terms) or upon acceptance for filing by the BCUC on 31 July 2009. In the
Tribunal’s view, this disagreement raises an issue of applicable law, not fact; but it is
nonetheless appropriate to decide that legal issue here. By Clause 1.5, the EPA’s
applicable law is agreed to be “made under, and shall be interpreted in accordance with,

the laws of the Province of British Columbia”.!°°

The Tribunal accepts the position ultimately put forward by the Respondent at the
Hearing that the EPA took effect, under its applicable law, according to its own express
terms: see its title at page 1 and paragraph 39 of appendix 1.!°7 Its effect did not depend
upon approval by the BCUC. The BCUC procedure was expressed as a “negative
disallowance scheme”: in other words, the BCUC had the power to declare a contract
unenforceable (as a condition subsequent), but it did not have the power to make a bare

agreement contractually enforceable in the first place (as a condition precedent). '®

This approach comports with Section 71 of the UCA, under which the BCUC “accepted
for filing” the 2009 EPA. Subsections (3)-(4) of that section provide:

“(3) If [the BCUC] determines that an energy supply contract is not in the public
interest], the commission may
(a) by order, declare the contract unenforceable, either wholly or to the extent
the commission considers proper, and the contract is then unenforceable to the
extent specified, or
(b) make any other order it considers advisable in the circumstances.
(4) If an energy supply contract is, under subsection (3)(a), declared
unenforceable either wholly or in part, the commission may order that rights
accrued before the date of the order under that subsection be preserved, and those
rights may then be enforced as fully as if no proceedings had been taken under
this section.”
Accordingly, by reason of the Exclusivity Provision in the 2009 EPA with BC Hydro,
Celgar was precluded from selling any of its self-generated electricity below its GBL,

both to BC Hydro and any third parties (subject to the Side Letter, as yet untriggered).
BCUC Order G-48-09

On 21 August 2008, Celgar and FortisBC executed a 30-year Power Supply Agreement
(the “2008 PSA”), pursuant to which Celgar (as buyer) was entitled to purchase from
FortisBC (as seller), on a firm basis and at embedded-cost, all the electricity required
to operate the Celgar Mill.'® The 2008 PSA was subject to approval by the BCUC; and
to that end FortisBC filed the 2008 PSA with the BCUC on 26 August 2008.

On 16 September 2008, BC Hydro filed an application with the BCUC to clarify (inter
alia) that the 1993 Power Purchase Agreement between BC Hydro and FortisBC (the
“1993 PPA”) prevented FortisBC from allowing self-generators to access electricity
obtained by FortisBC from BC Hydro under the 1993 PPA whilst these self-generators
were selling self-generated electricity.'” BC Hydro argued that self-generators in
FortisBC’s service area should be subjected to the principles expressed in Order G-38-

01. Celgar took part in these BCUC proceedings as interveners.

PUBLIC VERSION

3.88 At the end of September 2008, the BCUC asked FortisBC to withdraw the filing of its
2008 PSA with Celgar until after the proceedings initiated by BC Hydro had concluded.
FortisBC did so.!7!

3.89 On 6 May 2009, by Order G-48-09, the BCUC granted BC Hydro’s application to
amend its 1993 EPA with FortisBC, thereby directly imposing a “net-of-load” standard

on FortisBC’s customers. !””
3.90 The BCUC’s Order G-48-09 and Decision provided (inter alia) as follows:

“\.. given the industry practices, regulation and transmission capabilities that
were present in 1993 when the PPA was executed, the Commission Panel is of the
view that the parties to the PPA could not reasonably be expected to have
addressed the possible sale of power, not in excess of load, by self-generating
customers of FortisBC. Had the issue been posed by one of the parties at that
time, the response probably would have been: ‘But that’s impossible!’ As noted
by the BCOAPO [the British Columbia Old Age Pensioner’s Organization], ‘the
PPA became effective prior to market access of transmission services when export
activities of FortisBC customers with their own generation was not possible.’
(BCOAPO Argument p. 2-3) As noted above, the same issue did not come up as
between BC Hydro and its self-generating customers until the Commission
considered the matter in 2001 and issued Order G-38-01.”

“5. The Commission Panel is persuaded that a rate allowing for the sale of power
by self-generators, not in excess of their historical loads, is unjust and
unreasonable and therefore contrary to the public interest for the reasons that
follow. The Panel is of the view that the general principles enunciated in Order
G-38-01 ought to be extended to customers of FortisBC. We agree with BC Hydro
as to the characterization of the issue at hand as: ‘...whether the new use of PPA
power by FortisBC renders the current PPA, and specifically section 2.1 of it,
unjust or unreasonable because it allows certain (Fortis BC) customers to
unfairly profit from embedded cost utility service to the detriment of all other
customers.” (BC Hydro Reply Argument, p. 14, para. 43) ...”

“6.3 (a) The electricity purchased under this agreement is solely for the purpose
of supplementing FortisBC’s resources to enable it to meet its service area load
requirements and, shall not be exported or stored ... and (b) shall not be sold to
any FortisBC customer when such customer is selling self generated electricity
which is not in excess of its load. For greater certainty, paragraph (b) above is
to prevent FortisBC_ self-generating customers from purchasing power at

regulated embedded cost rates and simultaneously selling an equivalent amount

of power into available domestic and export markets ...”'”

Since the Celgar Mill was the only one of the Province’s pulp mills located within
FortisBC’s service area, the Celgar Mill was the only pulp mill that could be affected
by Order G-48-09. Accordingly, FortisBC could not supply Celgar embedded cost
electricity that it received from BC Hydro under the 1993 EPA unless Celgar was “net

of load”.

The BCUC subsequently acknowledged in its reasons accompanying Order G-19-14
that, in practical terms, Order G-48-09 affected Celgar and not merely FortisBC. BCUC

there observed as follows: !7*

“The practical effect of [Order G-48-09] was to require  self-
generating customers of FortisBC, of which Celgar is one, to service 100 per cent
of their load from self-generation, prior to engaging in export sales, to the extent
their load would otherwise be served indirectly by BC Hydro, and the 1993 PPA
(“net of load” ). (Commission Order G-48-09, RS 3808 PPA Decision, pp. 28-29.)
This ‘net of load’ methodology is different than the GBL methodology approved
for BC Hydro’s customers by Order G-38-01.”

The Tribunal accepts the BCUC’s characterisation of the practical effect of Order G-

48-09 on Celgar. The Tribunal returns later below to the issue whether BC Hydro’s

methodology towards its own mill customers was materially different from that applied

to FortisBC’s customers (i.e. Celgar).

FortisBC’s generation and electricity purchases (including its purchase from BC
Hydro) are commingled into a single resource stack. Following Order G-48-09,
FortisBC advised Celgar that, because FortisBC could not segregate BC Hydro PPA
power from power FortisBC generated from its own resources, FortisBC could comply
with the amended 1993 PPA only by denying Celgar all access to embedded cost utility

power whilst Celgar was selling its own self-generated electricity.

The Tribunal accepts the account given by Mr Merwin (of Celgar) in his written

testimony: !7°

“As a general matter, after the issuance of G-48-09,

Finally,
during a phone call in February 2010, advised

  
   

 

me that FortisBC had no tariffs or mandate in place to seta GBL, and considered
that only BC Hydro had the authority to assign GBLs to its customers.

thus informed me that
had decided that, before calculating a GBL, Fortis would require
guidelines from the BCUC on how to make that calculation. On another occasion,
FortisBC also advised Celgar that, because it could not segregate BC Hydro PPA
power from power FortisBC generated from its own resource stack, FortisBC
could comply with the amended 1993 PPA only by denying Celgar all access to
embedded cost utility power while Celgar is selling its self-generated electricity.”

3.95 As to the Amended 1993 PPA between BC Hydro and FortisBC, the Claimant’s expert

witness, Mr Switlishoff, testified:

“From a procedural and practical standpoint ... it is difficult to conceive that BC
Hydro could have computed a GBL for Celgar using anything other than the net-
of-load standard defined by the BCUC in Order G-48-09. With that proceeding
ongoing, BC Hydro would have undercut its position before the BCUC if it had
agreed to a less than load GBL for Celgar, as Celgar would have pointed that out
to the BCUC. Correspondingly, if BC Hydro had adopted a below-load GBL for
Celgar, and then prevailed before the BCUC in the proceedings that resulted in
Order G-48-09, it would not have been able to implement such GBL. BC Hydro
had little choice but to apply a net-of-load GBL to Celgar, which is exactly what
it did.”'"

3.96 The Tribunal finds Mr Switlishoff’s analysis broadly compelling.

cost power when selling power” (emphasis in original). The Tribunal mentions it for
completeness because it occupied much of the Hearing. The short point, however, is
that the Respondent adopts the evidence of its witness Mr Swanson (of FortisBC) He
testified that any action taken on the strength of this order in regard to the 2014 PPA
between BC Hydro and FortisBC and the NECP proceedings before the BCUC remains

“held in abeyance” for the time being, as a result of Celgar’s own choosing. !”*

3.98 On the strength of Order G-188-11, by its letter dated 6 December 2011, Celgar also
wrote to BC Hydro seeking to put in place the measures envisaged by the Side Letter. '”
BC Hydro has not taken any significant steps to put those measures in place, so that the
Side Letter likewise remains in abeyance. The Respondent’s witness, Mr Scouras,
explained in cross-examination that this was because “the focus of [their] efforts” had
been this arbitration.'8° In these circumstances, the Tribunal proceeds on the
assumption, for the purpose of this award, that the effect on Celgar of Order G-48-09

remains unaffected by the Side Letter.

into evidence. It was granted by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 13 (see Part I

above).

BCUC Order G-174-15 addresses BC Hydro’s application relating to the approval of
Contracted GBL Guidelines as well as the reconsideration of BCUC Order G-19-14
regarding Tariff Supplement No. 74, where the Guidelines would apply to prospective
EPA or LDA BC Hydro customers with new or incremental self-generation facilities. '*>
The Order decides that “after certain amendments the Guidelines will provide an
adequate and transparent framework to assist the Commission in the review of future
EPAs.” It concludes that “the Panel will give the final approval to the Guidelines with
the amendments directed in this decision after receipt of the updated Guidelines” from

BC Hydro, '*° which BC Hydro is directed to file.'*”

BCUC Order G-168-15A denies Fortis BC’s proposal for the NECP Rate Rider “as
part of the subject Application”. It notes that there was no opposition from the registered
interveners (including Celgar) and states that the “Commission will revisit Directive 4
of Order G-188-11, when the Commission makes a final determination on the FortisBC
Self-Generation Policy and the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority Section

2.5 Guidelines Applications.” !**

With regard to BCUC Order No. G-174-15, in brief, the Respondent contends that it is
the BCUC’s final ruling in the reconsideration process of BCUC Order No. G-19-14. It
shows that Order No. G-38-01 did not direct BC Hydro to set Contracted GBLs (i.e.
procurement GBLs), that Service GBLs are distinguished from Contracted GBLs, that

only Service GBLs pertain to the obligation to serve, and that a GBL is not a rate.

With regard to BCUC Order G-168-15A (with related correspondence), in brief, the
Respondent contends that this material forms part of the record on the status of
proceedings before the BCUC on the Non-PPA Embedded Cost Power Rate Rider (the
“NECP Rate Rider’). These disprove, so Respondent submits, a number of statements

made by the Claimant concerning the NECP Rate Rider, showing that the issue is one

between Celgar and FortisBC, and that the latter (as Celgar’s utility) disagrees with

Celgar's understanding of the NECP.

(ii) The BCUC Decision and Order G-27-16: This material was the subject of the
Claimant’s disputed application to admit the same into evidence. It was also granted by

the Tribunal in Procedural Order No 13 (see Part I above).

BCUC Order G-27-16 addresses FortisBC self-generation policy (“SGP”) application
filed with the BCUC on 9 January 2015. If the SGP application was approved by the
BCUC, the Commission had anticipated that it could possibly remove completely the
restrictions contained in Section 2.5 of Rate Schedule 3808 applicable to Rate Schedule
3808 electricity sales under the New PPPA of 2014 between BC Hydro and
FortisBC.'*° The Commission determined that it would proceed to review the
application following a two-stage approach, of which this Decision constitutes the first
prong.'? The Commission “provides both guidance and determinations to assist
FortisBC in the development of a comprehensive Self-Generation Policy and GBL
Guidelines” and orders Fortis BC “to file a Stage II Self-Generation Policy Application,
which includes both a comprehensive Self-Generation Policy and Generator Baseline

Guidelines” that will form the basis for Stage II of the review process. ?!

In brief, the Claimant contends that BCUC Decision and Order G-27-16 contradicts
evidence adduced by the Respondent on the issues of procurement and delegated
governmental authority. In addition, it is relevant to the Respondent’s contentions that
the Claimant is no longer subject to Order G-48-09’s net-of-load regulatory standard
due to Orders G-188-11 and G-202-12, that the Claimant is no longer subject to Order
G-48-09’s net-of-load regulatory standard due to Clause 2.5 of the 2013 PPA; that
Celgar could have previously obtained a “Service” GBL from FortisBC; that BCUC
Order G-38-01 applies only to third parties (as opposed to sales of electricity by a self-
generator to BC Hydro), on the role of a GBL in effectuating the regulatory policy of
the BC Ministry of Energy and BCUC to protect ratepayers by preventing “harmful”
arbitrage, and on whether the GBL and GBL-related exclusivity provisions of a BC

Hydro EPA impact a utility’s obligation to serve the self-generating customer.

3.108 For two reasons, the Tribunal has not taken these materials into account in arriving at
its decisions in this Award. First, as regards the Respondent’s materials, it is
unnecessary to do so. Second, as regards the Claimant’s material, not only is its weight
as evidence less than conclusive, but the end-result (as with the Respondent’ s materials)
appears still to lie in the future. This is inevitable given the continued involvement of
Celgar within the BCUC’s regulatory regime, together with BC Hydro and FortisBC.
Accordingly, for the purpose of this Award, the Tribunal decides to limit its

consideration of evidential materials as adduced by the Parties at the Hearing.

PART V: THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES

Introduction

The Tribunal addresses the Parties’ differences as to jurisdiction (with admissibility)
and as to the merits as distinct groups of principal issues. These issues are listed below
and subsequently addressed seriatim by the Tribunal in the Parts of the Award
indicated. These principal issues are not exhaustive of the Parties’ many other less

material differences comprising the entirety of their dispute.
The Principal Issues

(1) Jurisdiction and Admissibility—NAFTA Articles 1108, 1116, 1117, and 1503(2):
The Respondent raises three objections as to the jurisdiction and admissibility of the
Claimant’s claims: (i) that they are brought out of time; (ii) that they fall in part within
the exception concerning “procurement”; and (iii) that they concern the exercise of
commercial as opposed to delegated governmental authority. These jurisdictional

objections are addressed in Part VI below.

(2) Merits - NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103, 1105(1) and 1503(3): These principal issues
as to liability concern the merits of certain claims made by the Claimant under NAFTA
Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105(1), with, as assumed arguendo, NAFTA Article 1503(2),
together with related claims for compensation and interest. These principal issues are

addressed in Part VII below.
In Part VIII below, the Tribunal summarises its decisions.

(3) Costs: These issues concern legal and arbitration costs. These are addressed in Part

IX below.

In Part X below, the Tribunal sets out the Operative Part of this Award.

PUBLIC VERSION

PART VI: JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

(A) = Introduction

6.1 These principal issues comprise the Respondent’s several independent objections to the
Tribunal’ s jurisdiction and its exercise of jurisdiction over the Claimant’s claims (under
NAFTA Articles 1116(2), 1117(2), 1108(7)(a) and 1503(2)). These objections concern
only the claims relating to the 2009 EPA between Celgar and BC Hydro, with Celgar’s
GBL and the EPA’s Exclusivity Provision as contractual terms. !°? (They do not concern

directly the Claimant’s claims relating to BCUC Order G-48-09.)

6.2 The Parties were at times ambivalent whether these objections should be classified as
objections to jurisdiction or (as to some) to admissibility.!°? For present purposes, the
distinction is immaterial. In this case, the practical effect of each leads to the same result

under the Tribunal’s decisions.

6.3 It is common ground, which the Tribunal accepts, that the Claimant’s claims otherwise
meet the formal requirements required for the Tribunal to decide them in this
arbitration. On 26 January 2012, as required by NAFTA Article 1119, the Claimant
served its Notice of Intent upon the Respondent; and on 30 April 2012, not less than 90
days after its Notice and not less than six months since the events giving rise to its

claims, the Claimant served its Request for Arbitration upon the Respondent.

64 The Tribunal addresses in turn each of these several jurisdictional objections, falling
under three headings, beginning with NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2). Each is

independent from the other.
(B) NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2)

6.5 The first jurisdictional question is whether the claims concerning the 2009 EPA are

brought in time by the Claimant.

192 Clause 7.4 of the EPA, as set out in Part III above [C-221].

13 The Claimant that the di between jurisdiction and issibility did not matter in this case
[TD8.2172]. The jurisdi were jurisdicti save for its
objection as to “procurement” which went to admissibility, being a limited exception [TD1.199-200].

PUBLIC VERSION

NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) provide that an investor or enterprise on behalf
of which an investor claims, respectively, “may not make a claim if more than three
years have elapsed from the date on which the investor [or enterprise] first acquired, or
should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the

investor [or enterprise] has incurred loss or damage.”

It is common ground that the relevant time-bar date is 30 April 2009, i.e. three years
before the Claimant made its claims by filing its Request for Arbitration on 30 April

2012.14

It is disputed whether the time-bar date 30 April 2009 is after the date on which the
Claimant, ZCL or ZCLP first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the
alleged breach and knowledge that it had incurred loss or damage, within the meaning

of NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2).

For ease of reference below, the Tribunal refers to the knowledge, actual or
constructive, of Celgar only (comprising ZCL and ZCLP jointly) and not to each of the
Claimant, ZCL and ZCLP. Neither Party sought to distinguish between these parties’
respective state of knowledge. Moreover, given the close relationship between these
three parties as to ownership and control, the Tribunal infers that whatever was known
or should have been known to ZCL is attributable to the Claimant and/or ZCLP (neither

less nor more).

In brief, the Respondent submits, citing the NAFTA tribunal’s decision in Grand
River,'® that the time-bar will run from the first moment at which an investor “by
exercise of reasonable care or diligence ... would have known” of the facts giving rise
to the claim.'°° According to the Respondent, that was 30 May 2008, when Celgar’s
GBL was set or, at the latest, 7 June 2008, when Mr Merwin (of Celgar) was able to

write an internal memorandum stating:

“Assigned GBL: It should be noted that our commercial proposal includes a
Generator Base Load that has been assigned by BC Hydro. Essentially what this
means is BC Hydro will buy electricity above the GBL and the electricity below
is Celgar’s to do what it wishes with. The lower the GBL for Celgar the more

PUBLIC VERSION

Celgar gets to arbitrage to Hydro. We are currently debating our GBL with Hydro

as we believe they have not treated assignment of this number the same as they

have done for other pulp and paper mills.”
The effect of the Respondent’s submissions is the same so far as the Claimant’s claims
depend upon the treatment of several mill-comparators and Celgar’s knowledge of
those comparators’ treatment. According to the Respondent, this is not a case of an
alleged continuing breach or a pattern of conduct.'** Accordingly, the time-bars can
begin to run once only, i.e. on the date of treatment of the first comparator or knowledge

thereof, and not “with every single comparator”. !°

The Respondent thus submits that the Claimant’s claims crystallised when Celgar’s
GBL was set, since before the GBL was set “FortisBC [had] raised the regulatory
treatment Howe Sound had received in its discussions with the Claimant and that the
Claimant completed its own regulatory research in the context of laying the groundwork
for its so-called Arbitrage Project. The Claimant, therefore, knew, or ought to have
known, of Tembec’s and Howe Sound’s earlier treatment before it received its own
GBL from BC Hydro on May 30, 2008”.2 At the latest, therefore, the Claimant’s
knowledge ran from the memorandum of 7 June 2008 by Mr Merwin referred to
above.”°! (The Respondent did not specifically address the date on which the time on
the claim concerning the Exclusivity Provision began to run, but it did submit that the

2009 EPA, with the Exclusivity Provision, took effect on 27 January 2009.)

In brief, the Claimant submits, conversely, that the time-bars started to run only when
the Claimant’s claims were “ripe”, i.e. when the measure it complains of actually took
effect.?°? Since the GBL itself was “just a number”, it had effect only when the 2009
EPA gave effect to it; and the 2009 EPA itself entered into force, at the earliest, when
“approved” by the BCUC on 31 July 2009 (or perhaps even later, on its “Commercial
Operation Date” of 1 May 2010, later extended to 27 September 2010).7°

PUBLIC VERSION

So far as the Claimant’s claims depend upon the Respondent’s treatment of a
comparator, or the knowledge (actual or constructive) of that treatment by Celgar, the
Claimant submits that the time-bars began to run on the date of “the more favorable
treatment afforded to other mills” and that such treatment occurred after 31 July
2009.7" In its closing submissions, the Claimant argued that Celgar had no relevant
knowledge of the more favourable treatment of any of its comparators until this

arbitration.?°>

In its submission made under NAFTA Article 1128, the USA submits that the plain
terms of these NAFTA provisions mean that the limitation periods start to run once an
investor or enterprise knows, or should have known, of the alleged breach and loss or
damage incurred thereby, since knowledge cannot “first” be acquired more than once.
Accordingly, the USA submits, “where a comparator in like circumstances receives
treatment prior to the less favorable treatment accorded to an investor or investment,
the limitation period would commence on the date the investor or investment received
its treatment, to the extent that on that date the claimant knew or should have known of

the breach and of the alleged damage or loss.”?°°

The Tribunal has found in Part III above that the 2009 EPA took contractual effect on
its “Effective Date”: 27 January 2009. By this date, as there explained, both the GBL
and the Exclusivity Provision had been contractually agreed (subject to the Side Letter),
after negotiations and “debate” between Celgar and BC Hydro. Although it disputes the
date’s relevance, the Claimant accepts that, on 27 January 2009, “the implications of
the GBL and related restrictions were known to Mercer ...”2°7 By that date, therefore,
any arbitrariness, irrationality, non-transparency, or purely “idiosyncratic, unfair, or
unjust” treatment by BC Hydro in imposing both the GBL and the Exclusivity Provision
as contractual terms would have been apparent to Celgar. These are not relative
standards. Hence, before 30 April 2009, as to these particular factors only, Celgar had

acquired or should reasonably have acquired sufficient knowledge of any relevant

breach of NAFTA causing loss or damage, within the meaning of NAFTA Articles
1116(2) and 1117(2).

Subject to the following point, in regard to these particular factors, the Tribunal
therefore decides that it does not have jurisdiction (nor can it exercise jurisdiction) to
hear the Claimant’s claims concerning the 2009 EPA brought under NAFTA by virtue
of the time-bars in NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2).

The Tribunal decides that the position is materially different, however, as regards the
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections to the Claimant’s claims for what may broadly
be described as “discriminatory treatment”, brought under any of NAFTA Articles
1102, 1103 and 1105. These are pleaded by the Claimant as relative standards. As
pleaded, these claims depend (inter alia) upon Celgar’s actual or constructive
knowledge that at least one other BC pulp mill, as a comparator “in like circumstances”,
had received more favourable treatment than Celgar by 30 April 2009, causing loss or
damage to Celgar, the Claimant or ZCL. If such knowledge, whether actual or
constructive, was first acquired by Celgar after 30 April 2009, there can of course be

no time-bar under NAFTA Articles 1116(2) or 1117(2).

As to actual knowledge, the Tribunal notes the specificity of the pleading in the
Claimant’s Request for Arbitration of 30 April 2012, naming as mill comparators
Tembec’s Skookumchuck mill, Domtar’s Kamloops mill, Howe Sound’s Port Mellon

mill and Canfor’s Prince George mill:

“60. For example, BC Hydro’s 2009 EPA with Tembec sets the GBL for its
Skookumchuck mill at 14 MW, which coincides with its historical generation
capacity from the 1990s. Although Tembec’s actual mill load is 28 MW, it is
permitted to sell all generation over 14 MW to the market, while making
purchases of embedded cost power, that include Heritage Power, from BC Hydro,
to service the (14 MW) balance of its actual mill needs. Similarly, under the terms
of a 2008 agreement, Domtar’s Kamloops mill is obligated to self-supply only 20
MW, based on its historical generating capabilities from the 1970s. The Domtar
mill’s current load is 50 MW. Thus, Domtar is permitted to sell to the market all
generation above 20 MW, while making purchases of embedded cost power that
include Heritage Power, from BC Hydro, to service the 30 MW balance of its mill
load. The Port Mellon mill owned by Howe Sound apparently has a similar
arrangement, in which it will self-supply only about 20 per cent of its mill load
requirements, purchasing far in excess of 400 GWh/year from BC Hydro to
service its load while at the same time selling 400 GWh/year of its own generation

6.20

6.21

6.22

PUBLIC VERSION

output to BC Hydro. Canfor’s Prince George mill apparently also is able to sell

a portion of its self-generation that was previously used to supply mill load, while

purchasing embedded cost power that includes Heritage Power from BC Hydro

to satisfy an increased portion of its load requirements. Under the recently-

announced (January 4, 2012) agreement between BC Hydro and Nanaimo,

Nanaimo (it appears, based on publicly disclosed information) will be obligated

to self-supply slightly less than 50 percent of its mill load while selling power in

excess of such amount to BC Hydro. In each case, the mill receives the benefit of

Heritage Power denied, in similar circumstances, to the Celgar mill. 7208
In the Tribunal’s view, there is a marked contrast between these detailed allegations of
“discriminatory treatment” and the generalities in Mr Merwin’s memorandum of 7 June
2008. In the Tribunal’s assessment, there is no evidence that Celgar had, by 30 April
2009, acquired actual knowledge remotely equivalent to that reflected in the Request
for Arbitration. Indeed, the Claimant submits that all the alleged discriminatory
treatment occurred after 31 July 2009 (see above); and that, in submission as to that
treatment, “Mercer’s first knowledge of breach and actual loss was first acquired

through its counsel in this arbitration.”?°

As to constructive knowledge of such discriminatory treatment, the Tribunal does not
consider that Celgar could have acquired sufficient knowledge before 30 April 2009
with the exercise of reasonable care and diligence. The Tribunal notes that relevant
information regarding other pulp mills was not then publicly available. Indeed, as
already noted, BC Hydro considered such information (as regards GBLs) confidential
to each mill: Mr Dyck (of BC Hydro) testified that at the time in question BC Hydro
provided no information at all to Celgar about other entities’ GBLs or the details of
their EPAs, because it was confidential and so “[shouldn’t] have been available” to

them,?!°

Last but not least, the Tribunal notes Tembec concluded an EPA with BC Hydro that

constructive knowledge long in advance of agreement upon these GBLs is to be
attributed to Celgar (as to which there is no evidence), it follows that such knowledge

could only have been acquired by Celgar after the time-bar date of 30 April 2009.

Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that nothing in the evidence cited by the
Respondent in support of its contentions establishes that Celgar knew or ought to have
known by 30 April 2009 anything of sufficient substance about the different treatment
that any of its pulp mill comparators had received from BC Hydro, let alone the basis
upon which their respective GBLs had been calculated or their consequential effect on
Celgar.*!* Mr Merwin’s internal memorandum of 7 June 2008 evidences at its highest
a general suspicion within Celgar that some other entity or entities may have been
treated more favourably, without Celgar being able to identify such treatment or its

effect on Celgar.?!4

In these circumstances, it is not possible for the Tribunal to conclude that Celgar first
acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of any “discriminatory treatment”
and resulting loss or damage by 30 April 2009 within the meaning of NAFTA Articles
1116(2) and 1117(2). The burden of proof for that allegation rested on the Respondent.
It was not discharged by the Respondent, neither as to actual knowledge nor

constructive knowledge acquired by the exercise of reasonable case or diligence.

Accordingly, as to this part of the first jurisdictional question, the Tribunal decides
under NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) that it has jurisdiction over the Claimant’s
claims concerning the 2009 EPA by reference to Celgar’s GBL and Exclusivity
Provision only insofar as the Claimant’s pleadings allege “discriminatory treatment”
under any of NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105(1); i.e. that one or more other self-
generating pulp mills qualifying as Celgar’s comparators “in like circumstances”
received treatment more favourable than that received by Celgar, thereby causing loss
or damage. (That is not the end of the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections: such
claims raise different questions as to both jurisdiction and the merits, as considered

below.)

Save for that allegation in regard to “discriminatory treatment”, the Tribunal accepts
the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection to these claims under the time-bars imposed

by NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2).
NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a)

The second jurisdictional question is whether the Claimant’s claims (for itself, ZCL and
Celgar) relating to the 2009 EPA brought under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103
concern “procurement” by a state enterprise (BC Hydro), so that they are precluded by
NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a). NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a) provides that NAFTA Articles

1102 and 1103 “do not apply to procurement by a Party or a state enterprise”.

It is common ground between the Parties that “procurement” refers to “the obtaining
by purchase by a governmental agency or entity of title to . . . possession of, for instance,
goods, supplies, materials and machinery.”?'> It is also common ground that BC Hydro
was “a state enterprise” (being a Canadian provincial Crown corporation wholly owned

by the BC Government).?!¢

In brief, the Respondent contends that the GBL was a contractual term establishing the
amount of electricity that BC Hydro would purchase from Celgar under the 2009 EPA
and that the EPA’s Exclusivity Provision was an essential term adjunct to it, so that the
GBL and the Exclusivity Provision were alone and in combination a paradigm

procurement activity by BC Hydro as a state enterprise.?!”

In brief, the Claimant contends that the GBL and Exclusivity Provision applying to the
2009 EPA do not fall within this definition. The GBL, so the Claimant submits, was a
regulatory concept with its origins in Order G-38-01.?'* As for the GBL and the
Exclusivity Provision, the Claimant contends that since both terms had the effect of
limiting purchases by third parties, neither can have been material to purchases by BC

Hydro.?!? Indeed, the Claimant contends that the focus of its case is not directed on

electricity that BC Hydro bought from Celgar, but on electricity that BC Hydro declined

to buy from Celgar.?”

Nonetheless, the Claimant accepts that, if (which it denies) Celgar’s GBL did nothing
more than define BC Hydro’s purchase obligation under the 2009 EPA, such a measure

would fall within the procurement exception in NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a).77!

In its submission under NAFTA Article 1128, the USA observes that the Spanish and
French language versions of NAFTA use terms equivalent to “purchases” (compras and
achats, respectively) whereas the English has the term “procurement” only. The USA
submits that the procurement exception extends to “specifications in a procurement

contract that are integral parts of a procurement project”.??

In its submission under NAFTA Article 1128, Mexico submits that the term
“procurement” in NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a) is “not qualified or limited in any
manner”, again given that in the Spanish and French versions of NAFTA the generic
terms for “purchases” are used. Mexico further submits that “all of the contractual terms
and conditions associated with the procurement of a good by a NAFTA Party or a state
enterprise fall within the ambit of the term ‘procurement’ and thus are exempted from

Articles 1102 and 1103”.?3

In the Tribunal’s view, the English word “procurement”, as a matter of ordinary English
language, is the general act of buying goods and services. It is a broad term. The
Tribunal does not consider that the Spanish (or French) wording cited by the Parties
and Non-Disputing Parties introduces any materially different meaning. Nor, in the
Tribunal’s view, does the word “procurement” require a restricted meaning in NAFTA
Article 1108(7), because it operates as an exception to the grant of protection to
investors and investments under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103. To the contrary, its

ordinary meaning is broad and not restrictive.

As to its ordinary meaning in NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a), the Tribunal decides that the
phrase “procurement by a Party or a state enterprise”, in its context and in the light of

NAFTA’s object and purpose, signifies the buying of goods or services for or by a State

or a state enterprise (as defined in NAFTA Annex 1505) owned or controlled through

ownership interests by that State.

Here, under the EPA, the state enterprise (BC Hydro) is acting as the buyer of the goods
or services at issue. Therefore, provided that activity amounts to “procurement”,
NAFTA Articles 1102 (National Treatment), 1103 (MFN Treatment) and, albeit here
irrelevant, 1107 (Senior Management and Boards of Directors) do not apply to the

Claimant’s claims relating to the 2009 EPA.

NAFTA’s Chapter 11 does not define “procurement” any further. However, the phrase
is addressed in NAFTA’s Chapter 10 on “Government Procurement”. As scholarly
commentators had initially indicated, the relationship between NAFTA Article 1108 in
Chapter 11 and Chapter 10 was possibly less than clear. For example, there was an issue
whether NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a) included procurement by provincial or state entities
or whether it excluded entities and enterprises not listed in Annex 1001.1a2 and (when
agreed) Annex 1001.1a-3 to Chapter 10 of NAFTA. This question was answered with
a broad interpretation of NAFTA Article 1108(7) by the ICSID tribunal in ADF Group
v USA (considered below).

Conversely, where the NAFTA Party by any of its state enterprises (as defined in
NAFTA Annex 1505) acts as the seller of goods or services to investments in its
territory of investors of another NAFTA Party, that NAFTA Party is required (by
NAFTA Article 1503(3) on State Enterprises) to ensure that the qualifying state
enterprise accords non-discriminatory treatment. Here, the state enterprise is acting as
the seller or provider of goods or services at issue; and NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103,
1107 and 1503 do apply. Hence, there is a marked asymmetry in NAFTA’s Chapter 11
between a NAFTA Party’s state enterprise acting as the buyer and as the seller of goods
and services. Hence, in the Tribunal’s view, it can serve no purpose to interpret NAFTA

Article 1108(7) in the light of NAFTA Article 1503(3).

The issue of procurement has been addressed in other international instruments. Article
3(4)(c) of the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement (ACIA) excludes from
the scope of ACIA’s application “government procurement”, without any additional
wording. Thus, the ordinary English meaning of the word applies to signify the State
as the buyer or acquirer of the goods or services at issue. Article 8(3)(e) of the 2012

USA Model BIT excludes “government procurement” from the prohibition of certain

6.40

6.41

PUBLIC VERSION

performance requirements under Article 8(1) of the Model BIT. For this purpose,
Article 1 of the Model BIT defines “government procurement” as “the process by which
a government obtains the use of or acquires goods or services, or any combination
thereof, for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial sale or resale,
or use in the production or supply of goods or services for commercial sale or re-sale.”
The additional wording may add to the ordinary English meaning of procurement; but,
for present purposes, it retains its ordinary broad meaning as signifying the government

as the buyer of the goods or services at issue.

In ADF Group v USA,” the award addressed measures relating to a project by the state
of Virginia, USA, which had no direct contractual privity with the claimant. The
NAFTA tribunal looked to the ordinary meaning of procurement (with citations here

omitted):??°

“In its ordinary or dictionary connotation, ‘procurement’ refers to the act of
obtaining, ‘as by effort, labor or purchase.’ To procure means ‘to get; to gain; to
come into possession of’. In the world of commerce and industry, ‘procurement’
may be seen to refer ordinarily to the activity of obtaining by purchase goods,
supplies, services and so forth. Thus, governmental procurement refers to the
obtaining by purchase by a governmental agency or entity of title to or possession

of, for instance, goods, supplies, materials and machinery.

Hence, the tribunal, applying an English dictionary meaning, adopted an ordinary broad

interpretation of “procurement”.

In UPS v Canada,”® the award addressed measures relating to services provided by
Canada Post to Canada for a fee. The NAFTA tribunal decided that such services were
provided pursuant to a “commercial fee-for-service contract” covering services
provided to Canada, even though the fees were paid by third persons other than Canada.
It also cited, with approval, the interpretation made in the ADF Group v Canada award.
Again, in the Tribunal’s view, this decision sprang from an ordinary broad

interpretation of the word “procurement”.

From these several interpretations of “procurement”, applying the customary rules of
interpretation codified in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties, the Tribunal turns to its application in the present case. In so doing, it accepts
the Claimant’s submission that such an application should relate to substance and not

mere form.?27

The Tribunal accepts that one purpose of the GBL was to define the level above which
BC Hydro would purchase (hence, procure) electricity from Celgar. As a contractual
term of the EPA, it defined the level above which BC Hydro would purchase electricity
from Celgar. The Tribunal does not accept the Claimant’s submission that, as a
contractual term, Celgar’s GBL was simply ‘tuck[ed]’ into the EPA as a matter of form
only, so as to relieve the Respondent from responsibility under NAFTA Articles 1002
and 1103.?78 Nor, conversely, does the Tribunal accept Mexico’s submission under
NAFTA Article 1128 that “all” of the contractual terms and conditions of a procurement

contract fall within the definition of “procurement”.

However, the Tribunal has found in Part III above that Celgar’s GBL, as a concept,
performed a dual purpose. Outside the EPA, it defined the extent of BC Hydro’s
obligation to serve Celgar (as transmitted via FortisBC). The BCUC itself suggested
that an essential function of a GBL was the definition of BC Hydro’s obligation to
serve. To this extent, therefore, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant’s submission
(above) that Celgar’s GBL did more than define BC Hydro’s purchase obligation under
the 2009 EPA.

Was this difference materially affected by the fact that Celgar’s GBL of 30 May 2008
was then used to define BC Hydro’s purchase obligation under the 2009 EPA on 27
January 2009? In the Tribunal’s view, as applied to the 2009 EPA, it is not possible to

have one purpose extinguish the other.. This is a matter of substance and not mere form.

As decided in Part III above, this coin had two sides. Celgar’s GBL was a composite

concept where BC Hydro’s procurement of new (not existing) electricity was an

27 Cl. Reply, Paragraph 623.
28 Id.

6.47

6.48

6.49

PUBLIC VERSION

essential objective under the 2009 EPA, as understood by both BC Hydro and Celgar.

This point was best explained by Mr Dyck (of BC Hydro) in his testimony:

“Through an EPA or an LDA, BC Hydro then provides a financial incentive to
the customer in return for the customer’s commitment to produce self-generation
in excess of the GBL, which will decrease the demand on BC Hydro’s system to
the benefit of all customers. BC Hydro has no interest in paying a customer for
electricity that it already self-generates under normal operating conditions.
Payment for such ‘existing’ electricity would add nothing to BC Hydro’s resource
base, and would merely transfer wealth from BC Hydro and its customers to one
self-generator in exchange for nothing in return.”
This objective was achieved by Celgar’s GBL as a contractual term in the 2009 EPA.
However, the EPA could not affect Celgar’s GBL in defining the extent of BC Hydro’s
obligation to serve Fortis BC with electricity supplied by FortisBC. As already

indicated, this was a different objective, not limited to “procurement”.

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Celgar’s GBL, as a contractual term (but not
otherwise), was integral to the procurement function of the 2009 EPA. Accordingly,
the Tribunal (by a majority) decides that Celgar’s GBL, as part of the 2009 EPA, falls
within the procurement exception in NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a).

In the light of this decision, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to address the

Respondent’s further submissions based on the EPA’s contemporary Side Letter.?*°

The Tribunal also finds that the Exclusivity Provision in the 2009 EPA was integral to
the procurement function of the 2009 EPA. An exclusive-supply term is a common
feature of a procurement contract. In many cases, it is an important part of the
commercial bargain that is struck between the transacting parties, as a valuable
assurance to the purchaser that sufficient supply will be available, that is likely to be
reflected in the financial terms of that bargain. It was in fact a standard provision in all
the EPAs concluded by BC Hydro with self-generators. Again, this is a matter of
substance, not form. Accordingly, the Tribunal (by a majority) decides that the
Exclusivity Provision, as part of the 2009 EPA, falls within the procurement exception

in NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a).

In summary, the Tribunal (by a majority) decides that it has no jurisdiction over the
Claimant’s claims under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 insofar as they concern
Celgar’s GBL or the Exclusivity Provision as contractual terms in the 2009 EPA
(whether before or after 30 April 2009). To that extent only, the Tribunal (by a majority,
as explained below) accepts the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection under NAFTA

Article 1108(7)(a).

This decision does not affect the Claimant’s remaining claims by reference to Celgar’s
GBL unconnected with “procurement” under the EPA, under NAFTA Article 1105(1)
— which, as to the merits, are addressed later in this Award. The Tribunal now turns to
consider the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection to the Claimants’ claims based upon
BC Hydro’s alleged lack of “delegated governmental authority” for the purposes of
NAFTA Article 1503(2).

NAFTA Article 1503(2)

This third jurisdictional question is whether the claims regarding the 2009 EPA concern
BC Hydro’s exercise of “delegated governmental authority”, so as to permit the

Claimant to invoke the protection of NAFTA Article 1503(2).

NAFTA Article 1503(2) provides that Chapter 11 of NAFTA applies to the acts of state
enterprises, such as BC Hydro, only to the extent that a state enterprise “exercises any
regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority that the Party has delegated
to it, such as the power to expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions

or impose quotas, fees or other charges”.

In brief, as to BC Hydro’s determination of Celgar’s GBL, the Respondent submits that

the negotiation of a GBL by BC Hydro is a commercial act and not an exercise of

231

delegated governmental authority,~’’ since these words have a “limited scope” that do

not apply to the rights and powers of state enterprises “to enter into contracts for

99232

purchase or sale and to arrange and manage their own commercial activities. It relies

on the expert report of Mr Bursey to the effect that, at least as a matter of Canadian law,

231 Resp. C-Mem., Paragraphs 331-335.
232 Resp, Rej., Paragraph 211, citing UPS v Canada, Paragraphs 74-75.

PUBLIC VERSION

the BCUC’s practice of allowing BC Hydro to negotiate a GBL is not a delegation of

statutory decision-making authority or other governmental authority.7°?

6.55 In brief, the Claimant submits that BCUC Order G-38-01 “directed” BC Hydro to set
GBLs with its customers. It contends that BCUC provided BC Hydro with a discretion
to refine the general principle, to develop more detailed guidelines and to determine
GBLs in individual cases, which discretion is the hallmark of delegation.?** Indeed, so
the Claimant concludes, “BC Hydro was de jure the final arbiter and approver, and thus,
under Canada’s own argument, the responsible party exercising governmental

authority.”?*>

6.56 In its submission under NAFTA Article 1128, Mexico contends that wide discretion is
at best uncorrelated with the delegation of governmental authority. Mexico agrees with
the Respondent and the NAFTA tribunal in UPS v Canada that acts of a commercial
character fall outside the scope of NAFTA Article 1503(2) and that, in identifying
whether acts are of a commercial character, it is helpful to consider whether they are

within the powers of other businesses.?*°

6.57 In its submission under NAFTA Article 1128, the USA draws the Tribunal’s attention
to NAFTA Note 45, which explains that delegation “includes a ... government order,
directive or other act ..., transferring to the monopoly [or state enterprise], or
authorizing the exercise by the monopoly [or state enterprise] of governmental
authority”.>”7 The USA submits that these examples confirm that the term “other
governmental authority” means the authority of the NAFTA Party in its sovereign
capacity; and that a state enterprise is not exercising “governmental authority” merely

because it acts as a commercial participant in the marketplace.?**

6.58 The Tribunal is divided in its views as to this third jurisdictional objection, essentially

on the issue of BC Hydro’s “delegated governmental authority” regarding Celgar’s

exercise by the monopoly [or state enterprise] of, governmental authority.” The USA considers that, although
Note 45 refers to NAFTA Article 1502(3), the same definition of “delegation” should apply to NAFTA Article
1503(2), given that both refer to delegations of “regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority”;
referring to UPS v Canada, Paragraph 69.

GBL. Rather than elaborate upon its differences here, the Tribunal prefers to leave this
objection open in the light of other decisions made in this Award and proceed to the
merits in Part 7 on the basis of a working assumption in favour of jurisdiction, for the
sake of analysis only. As appears below, these other decisions render this jurisdictional

objection moot.
Conclusion

No jurisdictional objection was taken by the Respondent to the Claimant’s claims
concerning BCUC Order G-48-09; and the Tribunal confirms that it has jurisdiction
and may exercise jurisdiction over the legal and factual merits of those particular

claims.

So far as concerns the Claimant’s claims concerning the 2009 EPA between Celgar and
BC Hydro under NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105, the Tribunal (by a majority)
decides that it has no jurisdiction to decide such claims by reason of NAFTA Articles
1116(2), 1117(2) and 1180(7)(a), save only insofar as these claims allege
“discriminatory treatment” under NAFTA Article 1105 (as advocated by the Claimant),
i.e. that one or more other pulp mills qualifying as Celgar’s comparators “in like
circumstances” received treatment more favourable than that received by Celgar,

causing loss or damage to the Claimant, ZCL or Celgar.

Save only for the Claimant’s said claims alleging “discriminatory treatment” (addressed
below), it follows that no claim concerning the 2009 EPA for compensation under
NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105(1) requires the decision of the Tribunal; and
that, consequentially, the Tribunal (by a majority) dismisses the Claimant’s claims for

such compensation and related claims for interest.

The Tribunal here leaves open, for present purposes, the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objection under NAFTA Article 1503(2). As indicated above, it requires no
adjudication by the Tribunal for the purpose of this Award; and, in the circumstances,
an attempt to do so would be inappropriate. Nonetheless, for the sake of argument only,
it is appropriate to assume that the Tribunal has jurisdiction address the Claimant’s

remaining claims with NAFTA Article 1503(2).

Dissent: Arbitrator Orrego Vicufia regrets not to be able to join the views of his

distinguished colleagues in this Tribunal.

PUBLIC VERSION

A first discrepancy concerns the issue of procurement discussed in Paragraphs 6.27ff.
The Tribunal has opted at Paragraph 6.58 of the Award to leave open the question about
the nature of the authority of BC Hydro regarding the determination of Celgar’s GBL.
There is no doubt in this Arbitrator’s mind about the fact that BC Hydro operated for
this purpose under a delegated government authority. While in Canada’s argument this
is the exercise of procurement, which as such is excluded from NAFTA’s jurisdiction,
the Claimant is of the view that the delegation of government authority is separate from

procurement and hence under the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

A broad interpretation of procurement would have the effect of transforming a carve
out provision into an escape clause because any exercise of government authority,
however indirect, would result in excluding the transaction involved from NAFTA’a
jurisdiction under the concept of procurement. This cannot be a reasonable
interpretation of a Treaty as all obligations and commitments would vanish as
procurement activities. BC Hydro operated beyond doubt under government authority
channeled through different layers of State, Provincial or local authorities. This is not
procurement. Hence the Respondent cannot evade its responsibility for breach of the
Treaty. This discussion brings to the fore the traditional international law distinction
between “jure gestionis” and “jure imperii”. In the instant case the procurement

exception under the former could not be possible without the latter.

A still more difficult issue concerns the counting of time in this dispute. As the Award
explains, in Paragraphs 6.6ff, the general criterion governing a time bar is that an
investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from the date on
which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the
alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage. Knowledge
or assumption of knowledge can of course only be determined after the obligation has
been born. This will ordinarily occur at the time a contract is executed. In the instant
case, however, it is impossible to learn about the alleged breach and the consequential
damage until the process of approval of the contract has been completed by the BCUC,
as this body is entitled even to turn down the contract entered into. This only happened
at a point in time different and later from the formal execution of the contract which is
within the allowable time to bring a claim. Before this point in time, it is impossible to
establish whether knowledge of a breach and the existence of loss or damage has

occurred.

6.67

PUBLIC VERSION

In case of doubt the Tribunal should have opted for an interpretation more favorable to
the Claimant. While the trend in the vast literature and jurisprudence available both
under international law and investment treaty law is varied, nonetheless it is clear that
time only starts counting at the moment when there is a firm obligation on the part of
the Respondent, which in this case was in fact different from the date of execution of

the contract.

PART VII: MERITS

Introduction

In this Part VII, as to the merits, the Tribunal addresses the principal issues arising
from the Claimant’s remaining claims under NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105(1),
with, as assumed arguendo, NAFTA Article 1503(2).

Earlier, in Part VI above, the Tribunal decided that it has no jurisdiction (nor the right
to exercise any jurisdiction) to decide the Claimant’s claims, save for (i) its claims
relating to BCUC Order G-48-09 of 6 May 2009 under NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103
and 1105 (as to which there was no jurisdictional objection) and (ii) its claims relating
to “discriminatory treatment” by reference to Celgar’s GBL under NAFTA Article 1105
(as to which the “procurement” exception in NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a) does not apply,
nor the Respondent’s time-bar objections under NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2)).

These are therefore the Claimant’s “remaining claims” to be addressed on their merits.
Although these two groups of claims are distinct, they overlap as regards
“discriminatory treatment” in regard to Celgar’s GBL. For this reason, it is convenient

to consider them together in the following sections.
The Parties’ Cases on “Discriminatory Treatment”

The Claimant: In brief, the Claimant contends, first, that the Respondent required
Celgar under its GBL to meet its own energy load without compensation, whereas other
pulp mills were compensated fully for doing so. Second, the Claimant contends that
through BCUC Order G-48-09, the Respondent subjected Celgar to treatment less
favourable than that accorded to domestic or other foreign investors and investments.
Third, assuming jurisdiction, the Claimant contends that the Respondent failed to put
in place supervision adequate to ensure that the rights of the Claimant, ZCL and Celgar
were not breached under NAFTA by BC Hydro, thereby rendering the Respondent
liable under NAFTA.

The Respondent: In brief, the Respondent contends that, far from being subjected to
less favourable treatment, the treatment of Celgar has been conspicuously favourable:

in particular, Celgar had the unique benefit of the EPA’s Side Letter, as well the ability

to arbitrage in accordance with Order G-118-14. In any event, the Respondent submits
that BC Hydro properly fixed GBLs for BC pulp mills according to principles that could
not be reduced to mere formulae, but rather depended upon the particular circumstances
of each individual mill. The Respondent further contends that Order G-48-09 had no
effect on Celgar directly, as it was a restriction on FortisBC rather than on Celgar and

that, in any case, it post-dated the setting of Celgar’s GBL.
The Tribunal’s Analysis on “Discriminatory Treatment”

Legal Standard: Although the Parties approached the matter slightly differently, it was
common ground that establishing a violation of NAFTA Articles 1102 or 1103 involves
an inherently fact-specific analysis of whether Celgar: (i) was accorded treatment by
the Respondent with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management,
conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments; (ii) was in like
circumstances with the identified domestic or foreign investors or investments as
comparators; and (iii) received treatment Jess favourable than that accorded to those

identified investors or investments.

The Claimant added that it did not have to establish discriminatory intent on the
Respondent’s part.?*? The Respondent characterised this as a mistaken submission that
nationality was wholly irrelevant.?*° The Tribunal does not accept the Claimant’s
submission, based (inter alia) on the submissions of the USA and Mexico summarized

below which the Tribunal accepts.

In its submission made under NAFTA Article 1128, the USA submits that
discrimination under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 may be de jure or de facto, with
de facto discrimination occurring when a facially-neutral measure with respect to

nationality is applied in a discriminatory fashion based on nationality.**!

In its submission made under NAFTA Article 1128, Mexico submits that a NAFTA
tribunal should only find a breach of NAFTA Article 1102 where the impugned
measure facially discriminates on the basis of nationality, or where it can properly be

inferred, in all of the circumstances, that a facially neutral measure has the effect of

discriminating against foreign investors as a class with no rational or good faith policy
objectives. Mexico adds that such a finding will be most unlikely in situations where
the treatment accorded to domestic investors is not materially different to that accorded

to other foreign investors.74

It is not in issue that the requirements for establishing a violation of NAFTA Article
1103 are the same as establishing a violation of NAFTA Article 1102, except that the
applicable comparator, in like circumstances, is a foreign (non-Canadian) investor or

investment.

Burden of Proof: Relying on the award in UPS, the Respondent submits that the legal
burden of proof rests on the Claimant to prove its allegations, namely that each of these
three elements was “a legal burden that rests squarely with the Claimant. That burden

never shifts to the Party.”24

In its submission under NAFTA Article 1128, the USA submits that, “Nothing in the
text of Articles 1102 or 1103 suggests a shifting burden of proof. Rather, the burden to
prove a violation of these articles, and each element of its claim, rests and remains

squarely with the claimant.”?“+

In its submission under NAFTA Article 1128, Mexico likewise agrees that the burden
remains on the Claimant throughout; and that the Claimant must establish more than a

prima facie case.**

The Tribunal agrees with these Article 1128 submissions. However, the Tribunal must
also take account of the distinction between the legal burden of proof (which never
shifts) and the evidential burden of proof (which can shift from one party to another,
depending upon the state of the evidence). Moreover, every party bears the burden of

proving its positive allegations, whether claimant or respondent.

In the Pulp Mills case, the ICJ noted that: “...in accordance with the well-established
principle of onus probandi incumbit actori, it is the duty of the party which asserts

certain facts to establish the existence of such facts. This principle which has been

consistently upheld by the Court applies to the assertions of fact both by the Applicant
and the Respondent.””4° It is thus, under international law, for a claimant to prove its
own positive case and likewise for a respondent to prove its own positive defence, if it

has a case to meet.

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that, whilst the legal burden of proof rests always on
the Claimant to prove its claims under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103, the question
whether the evidential burden shifts to the Respondent remains relevant, including the

question whether any positive defence put forward by the Respondent is established.

Treatment: It is common ground that the treatments at issue under NAFTA Articles
1102 and 1103 are the assessment of “discriminatory treatment” by BC Hydro (which
the Claimant compares both to other GBLs and to the load displacement agreements

offered to other mills) and the BCUC by Order G-48-09.

Like Circumstances: The next question confronted by the Tribunal is whether it is
required to determine whether it is the investor or the treatment received by the investor

that is to be “in like circumstances”.

The Claimant’s submissions focus on the circumstances of the investor.?47 The
Respondent contends that that is inappropriate and contrary to the plain wording of
NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103, which require the Claimant to prove that the treatment
accorded to the investor or its investments was “in like circumstances”.”4* In its
submission made under NAFTA Article 1128, Mexico agrees with the Respondent on

this issue.?””

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent and with Mexico. In its view, the clearest

explanation of the position is found in the NAFTA award in Cargill v Mexico:*°

“Thus, in both GAMI and Pope & Talbot, ‘like circumstances’ was determined
by reference to the rationale for the measure that was being challenged. It was
not a determination of ‘like circumstances’ in the abstract. The distinction
between those affected by the measure and those who were not affected by the

measure could be understood in light of the rationale for the measure and its
policy objective. Indeed, it is possible that in respect of other, different measures,
the mills in GAMI and the lumber producers in Pope & Talbot could have been
found to be in ‘like circumstances’ ...”
In this case, therefore, the question for the Tribunal is whether Celgar’s treatment is in
“like circumstances” with any comparator with respect to the particular measures in

question.

The Claimant identified a series of comparators for various purposes during the
arbitration. At its highest, the Claimant’s case focused on two mills and their respective

owners:

(1) The Port Mellon mill: Howe Sound Pulp and Paper (also “Howe Sound”), owned
at all relevant times 50 per cent by a Canadian corporation and 50 per cent by a

non-US foreign corporation; and

(2) The Skookumchuck mill: Tembec Industries Inc (also “Tembec’’), owned at all

material times by Canadian interests.

Both alleged comparators are self-generating pulp mills operating not in FortisBC’s
area (like Celgar) but in BC Hydro’s own service area, subject to Order G-38-01. One
comparator is domestic; and the other foreign. Both have GBLs set under EPAs with
BC Hydro: Howe Sound’s EPA is dated 7 September 20107! and Tembec’s EPA is
dated 13 August 2009.7? The Tribunal accepts them as being ostensibly comparators,
whilst addressing below the additional issue of “like circumstances” as regards both

measures, namely Order G-48-09 and Celgar’s GBL.

Less Favourable: The Claimant contends that it is entitled to “best in jurisdiction”
treatment, under both NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103. It draws attention to NAFTA
Article 1102(3), which provides: “The treatment accorded by a Party under paragraphs
1 and 2 means, with respect to a state or province, treatment no less favorable than the
most favorable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that state or province to

investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part.”?53

It submits that the same result is implicit in NAFTA Article 1103 because: “The only
way to provide treatment no less favorable than afforded to all comparators is to provide
treatment equal or better to that afforded the most favorable treatment.”*** In any case,
the Claimant observes that NAFTA Article 1104 requires each NAFTA Party to accord

investors “the better of” the treatment required by NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103.

The Respondent submits, without differentiating between NAFTA Articles 1102 and
1103, that the Claimant would be entitled not to “best in jurisdiction” treatment, but
treatment “at least as favourable as the treatment of the relevant comparator to which it

is being compared.”?°>

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant. In a case such as the present, where the
treatment of both domestic and other foreign comparators is in question, the effect of
NAFTA Article 1104 is that the Claimant is entitled to treatment no less favourable
than the most favourable of the more favourable treatment afforded to domestic or
foreign comparators, in like circumstances. For completeness, the Tribunal doubts that
the omission of any equivalent of paragraph (3) of NAFTA Article 1102 in NAFTA

Article 1103 is without significance.

The relevant pulp mills as regards the Claimant’s submissions on different treatment
applied to Celgar comprised mills owned by Howe Sound and Tembec, namely Port
Mellon and Skookumchuck. If these were comparators in “like circumstances” to
Celgar, NAFTA Article 1104 entitled Celgar to have the GBL for its Mill calculated

similarly to the GBLs for the Mellon and Skookumchuck mills, if more favourable.

As regards these suggested differences, was the treatment applying to Howe Sound and
Tembec “in like circumstances” to the treatment applying to Celgar; and, if so, was
either “more favourable”? As to these questions, the disagreements between the Parties’
respective expert witnesses were stark. Whilst acknowledging the industry and
expertise of all four of the Parties’ experts, the Tribunal prefers the expert testimony of
Dr Rosenzweig and Mr Stockard adduced by the Respondent to that of Dr Fox-Penner
and Mr Kaczmarek adduced by the Claimant.

7.30 Dr Rosenzweig concluded, as regards Celgar’s GBL, that “Differences in GBL were
the result of differences in the mills’ individual circumstances. This was true not only
across all the mills [i.e. the 12 mills in the Province assessed by Dr Rosenzweig], but
also when Celgar was compared to each of the individual mills, including the two mills
on which Mercer bases its claim [i.e. Tembec’s Skookumchuck mill and Howe Sound’s

Port Mellon mill].”?>°

7.31 As regards Tembec’s Skookumchuck’s mill, Dr Rosenzweig confirmed that, whilst

Celgar’s GBL was based on actual generation in its GBL base year, Skookumchuck’s
GBL was not. He continued:°”

“This difference, however, does not constitute an inconsistent methodology, but
rather reflects the differences in contractual obligations of the mills. The critical
difference is that, during the years leading up to the 2009 EPA, Skookumchuck’s
operational decisions were influenced by its contract that committed it to sell
generation from its plant. Because the obligations under the 1997 EPA would be
disappearing, actual generation at Skookumchuck would have been an
inappropriate baseline for its GBL as it would not have accurately represented
what was truly incremental generation to be incentivized in the 2009 EPA. It was
therefore necessary to base Skookumchuck’s GBL on a model of the amount of

 
 

as the parties agreed it would, considering the
economic conditions at the time absent an EPA. In contrast, Celgar never had a
contract with BCH, [i.e. BC Hydro] it self-supplied essentially all of its load, and
its operations in 2007 represented current normal self-generation in the absence
of a contract.

In conclusion, both Celgar’s and Tembec’s GBLs were set following a consistent
BCH methodology. The differences in the details of how each mill’s GBL was
calculated are explained by the unique circumstances of the mill (such as a prior
EPA with BCH), and reflect a consistent application of BCH’s GBL
methodology.”

“Like Celgar, Port Mellon was assigned a GBL set at the level of its own load
that it would have supplied with self-generation in the absence of a contract with
BCH. At the time its EPA was negotiated, Celgar’s generation exceeded the level
of its load on an annual basis, so its GBL was adjusted downward to reflect the
amount of generation it used to self-supply, i.e. its entire load. Similarly, Howe
Sound’s GBL was based on the amount of historical generation it used to supply
its load. In Howe Sound’s case, however, this level was below its load. As Howe
Sound’s mill load is almost three times greater than Celgar’s, this difference is
not surprising. There are other small differences in the details of the two mills’
GBL determinations. While Celgar experienced a normal year of operation in
2007 (and so that year was the basis for its GBL), Port Mellon had to rely on

consistent with BCH’s methodology as discussed above. All of Celgar’s sales
were from generation incremental to its load, so setting the GBL at load

as prior sales contracts with BCH/Powerex and problems with generation
equipment), and reflect a consistent application of BCH’s GBL methodology.”
The Tribunal accepts this expert testimony. Beyond that, albeit with due deference to
the Parties’ extensive submissions and the testimony of their expert witnesses, the
Tribunal considers that it would be inappropriate to come to its own view about the
correctness of the particular GBL fixed for any of Tembec, Howe Sound or Celgar.

decisions made by BC Hydro or the BCUC, particularly on such extensive and complex
technical matters calling for specialist judgment to be exercised by BC Hydro and the

BCUC at the particular time.

LDAs: That leaves the Claimant’s claim that it received less favourable treatment than
Howe Sound and Canfor inasmuch as these companies had the benefit of LDAs,
whereas Celgar did not. This claim, described by the Claimant as its “simplest”, is that
it is “less favorable” treatment for BC Hydro to compel Celgar to provide load
displacement services. The Claimant submits that, because BC Hydro did not obtain an
LDA with Celgar, it cannot require Celgar to provide any load displacement services
without treating Celgar less favourably than those to whom it paid substantial
consideration.?>? The consequence, so the Claimant concludes, is that “Celgar’s GBL

should have been zero”.°°

In the Tribunal’s view, it is logically dubious and highlights the solecism identified by
the Respondent (and the tribunal in Cargill, above) of attempting to draw comparisons
in the abstract rather than concentrating on the particular circumstances of the

impugned treatment.

The first difficulty is the Claimant’s simple equiparation of the GBL with load
displacement. Although the Tribunal has emphasised the importance of the GBL’s
purpose in delineating BC Hydro’s obligation to serve, that was clearly not its only
purpose (see Part VI(C) above). The GBL’s purpose of setting the level above which
BC Hydro was required to purchase power remained a significant purpose. The

Claimant’s elision of an LDA and GBL overlooks this latter purpose.

More fundamentally, the Claimant has not demonstrated that any comparison between
a GBL and an LDA can be meaningfully carried out. There are any numbers of
arrangements that an enterprise such as BC Hydro might conclude with its
counterparties. The Tribunal accepts, of course, that if such arrangements are entered
into, then they must be entered into without violating NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103.
That does not mean that every investor is entitled to precisely the same arrangements
relating to the treatment of its investment as are agreed with every other investor

relating to the treatment of its investment, whatever the particular circumstances

relevant to both investments. In short, the Claimant is not entitled to the benefit of every
arrangement ever agreed by BC Hydro merely because a benefit exists, whatever the
particular circumstances of the beneficiary. The Tribunal finds these difficulties to be

fatal to this part of the Claimant’s claims.

BCUC G-48-09: As regards the Claimant’s claims for “discriminatory treatment”
regarding BCUC G-48-09, the Tribunal can decide these claims with relative
succinctness. As regards such treatment, the Claimant’s complaint is effectively
directed at BC Hydro and the BCUC for precluding Celgar’s ability to arbitrage with
sales of energy to third parties, including its ability to access (via Fortis BC) BC
Hydro’s low cost energy. However, the effect of that complaint is limited., according

to the Claimant’s own case.

Thus, the Claimant only claims damages arising from the Respondent’s alleged liability

resulting from Order G-48-09 itself.?“ Given that the Tribunal has dismissed the
Claimant’s case regarding Celgar’s GBL (see above), the Claimant’s claim for
“discriminatory treatment” under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 regarding BCUC

Order G-48-09 becomes otiose. The Tribunal therefore dismisses this claim.

"265 is owed to its Province’s

no burden of proof and that a “high measure of deference’
regulatory policy, the Respondent put forward in its Rejoinder a positive defence of the
governmental policy on which it says BC Hydro’s GBL methodology was based. This

defence was directly responsive to criticisms made by the Claimant in its Reply.7°

Consistent with its analysis above, the Tribunal approaches this policy defence on the
basis that the Respondent bore the burden of making good its positive case. The
Tribunal also accepts as a general legal principle, in the absence of bad faith, that a

measure of deference is owed to a State’s regulatory policies.

The Respondent contends that BC Hydro’s GBL policy sought efficient and
incremental generation resources that did not result in harmful arbitrage, rather than to
“award benefits” to self-generating mills, and to do so in a way that was neutral as to
where a purchaser of Celgar’s electricity resided.” The Tribunal concludes that these

were objectives that it was not improper for BC Hydro to pursue.

The Tribunal determines that, however opaque the BCUC may have considered BC
Hydro’s GBL methodology to be at the time, BC Hydro did approach Celgar’s GBL on
the basis of a materially consistent methodology and that it differed in the results
between different mills (particularly the Celgar Mill, the Skookumchuck mill and the
Port Mellon mill) owing to the particular circumstances of each individual mill. It
would accordingly be meaningless for this Tribunal retrospectively to adjust these
different circumstances in order to attempt an exact comparison of what account ought
to have been taken, or not, by BC Hydro of any particular circumstance; for example
(which achieved some prominence at the Hearing) the significance of the
Skookumchuck mill’s hog boiler in determining Tembec’s GBL. As already explained,

this Tribunal is not a court of appeal.

Summary: In summary, as regards the Claimant’s claims under NAFTA Articles 1102
and 1103 relating to “discriminatory treatment”, the Claimant has established that
Celgar was treated differently from other self-generating pulp mills in the Province,

including Howe Sound and Tembec. However, in the different circumstances pertaining

to Celgar and each of these other mills, that different treatment is not proven to be
“discriminatory treatment” in violation of NAFTA Articles 1102 or 1103. Whilst
ostensibly comparators, none were “‘in like circumstances” for the purposes of NAFTA
Articles 1102 and 1103; and their different treatment can best be explained on the basis
of their individual circumstances under BC Hydro’s consistent application of its GBL
methodology. The Claimant here bore the legal burden of proving its case; the
evidential burden never shifted to the Respondent; and the Claimant did not discharge

its burden.

Conclusion: For these several reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimant’s remaining
claims as regards “discriminatory treatment” under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103

(together with, as assumed, NAFTA Article 1503).
NAFTA Article 1105(1)

The Tribunal here considers the Claimants’ claims that the Respondent has breached
NAFTA Article 1105(1). Again, the effect of the Tribunal’s jurisdictional decisions in
Part VI means that it has jurisdiction (or can exercise jurisdiction) over these claims
only insofar as they concern BCUC Order G-48-09 or allege “discriminatory treatment”
under NAFTA Article 1105(1). It is appropriate to consider first the Claimant’s claims

for “discriminatory treatment”.

NAFTA Article 1105(1): NAFTA Article 1105(1) requires that: “Each Party shall
accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with
international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and

security.”

On 31 July 2001, the NAFTA Free Trade Commission adopted the following Note of
Interpretation regarding the minimum standard of treatment under Article 1105(1),

entitled “Minimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with International Law”:

“(1) Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum
standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be
afforded to investments of investors of another Party. (2) The concepts of ‘fair
and equitable treatment’ and ‘full protection and security’ do not require
treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens. (3) A determination

international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article
1105(1).”
Under NAFTA Article 1131(2), an interpretation by the Free Trade Commission of a
NAFTA provision “shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section.” The
Tribunal, of course, accepts in this arbitration the binding effect of the Free Trade

Commission’s Note of Interpretation.
The Parties’ Cases on NAFTA Article 1105(1)

The Claimant’s Case: In brief, the Claimant begins by submitting that the customary
standard of treatment imported by NAFTA Article 1105 is not fixed in time,” but has
rather evolved in particular to prohibit treatment that is arbitrary, grossly unfair, non-
transparent and discriminatory, including insofar as it precluded a stable regulatory

environment for its investment.”

The Tribunal intends no criticism of the Claimant in observing that its case under
NAFTA Article 1105(1) restates the allegations that it raised in respect of NAFTA
Articles 1102 and 1103. It is necessary again to recall that only the claims concerning
Order G-48-09 and any allegedly “discriminatory treatment” under NAFTA Article
1105(1) are here eligible for consideration by the Tribunal on their merits. It is therefore
relevant to note that the Claimant expressly adopts and repeats its case under NAFTA
Articles 1102 and 1103 so far as it alleges “discriminatory [treatment] under NAFTA
Article 1105(1).?”°

As to its other claims under NAFTA Article 1105(1), the Claimant summarises its
“grievance” as being “that BC has permitted the persistence of a completely non-
transparent, idiosyncratic, and arbitrary regulatory regime - one that had no lacking
written rules or standards governing self-generators’ access to embedded cost utility
power, and where the BCUC and BC Hydro made arbitrary GBL decisions ad hoc, case

by case, in a process utterly lacking in transparency.”?7!

The Respondent’s Case: In brief, the Respondent’s position is that the Claimant has

failed properly to apply the legal standard applicable under NAFTA Article 1105(1)

and that none of the measures of which the Claimant complains come close to
establishing that the Respondent violated its obligations under NAFTA Article
1105(1).?”

7.55 NAFTA Article 1128 Submissions: Both the USA and Mexico submit that the threshold
under NAFTA Article 1105(1), as in customary international law, is high and does not
embrace nationality-based discrimination, which is instead properly addressed under

NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103.77
(F) The Tribunal’s Analysis on NAFTA Article 1105(1)

7.56 The Tribunal’s starting-point concerns the content of the standard of treatment,
comprising fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security, under NAFTA

Article 1105(1) read with the FTC Interpretation.

7.57 Inabroad survey of legal materials, the NAFTA tribunal concluded, in Merrill & Ring
v Canada, that the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law,
even in the absence of bad faith or malicious intention on the part of the State, precluded
conduct “which is unjust, arbitrary, unfair, discriminatory or violation of due
process”.’”* As regards that standard under NAFTA 1105(1), the tribunal decided that
it provided for “the fair and equitable treatment of alien investors within the confines

of reasonableness”.?”>

7.58 So far as concerns the Claimant’s claims of “discriminatory treatment” contrary to
NAFTA Article 1105(1), the Tribunal’s agrees with the non-disputing NAFTA Parties’
submissions that such protections are addressed in NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103,
rather than NAFTA Article 1105(1).

7.59 The Tribunal also notes the approach taken in the Final Award in Methanex v USA.?”°
There, the NAFTA tribunal decided that, even without the FTC Interpretation:

“\.. the plain and natural meaning of the text of Article 1105 does not support the
contention that the ‘minimum standard of treatment’ precludes governmental
differentiations as between nationals and aliens. Article 1105(1) does not mention

discrimination; and Article 1105(2), which does mention it, makes clear that
discrimination is not included in the previous paragraph. By prohibiting
discrimination between nationals and aliens with respect to measures relating to
losses suffered by investments owing to armed conflict or civil strife, the second
paragraph imports that the preceding paragraph did not prohibit — in all other

 

circumstances — diffe iations between ionals and aliens that might
otherwise be deemed legally discriminatory — inclusion unius est exclusion
alterius. The textual meaning is reinforced by Article 1105(3), which makes clear
that the exception in paragraph 2 is, indeed, an exception.”
In the circumstances, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant’s claims for
“discriminatory treatment” under NAFTA Article 1105(1) can add nothing to the
Claimant’s claims under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103, which the Tribunal has

already dismissed.

The Tribunal adds that it would be inconsistent with the principle of effet utile for a
claimant to avoid the “procurement” exception in NAFTA Article 1108(7) (which
excludes discrimination claims under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 in relation to
“procurement”) simply by advancing the same discrimination claims as a breach of the
minimum standard of treatment in NAFTA Article 1105(1). A measure relating to
procurement can be impugned pursuant to NATA Article 1105(1), but not on the basis
that nationals of the respondent State or nationals of a third State were treated more
favourably in the context of a procurement exercise undertaken by the respondent State

or one of its state enterprises.
BCUC Order G-48-09

Introduction: The Tribunal next addresses the remaining parts of the Claimant’s claims
under NAFTA Article 1105(1) relating to BCUC Order G-48-09. The Claimant
provides a succinct summary of these claims in its Reply, here cited in full as regards

measures impugned by the Claimant:

“33. Mercer contends first that BCUC Order G-48-09 imposes a net-of-load
access standard on Celgar, by effectively preventing FortisBC from selling
Celgar any embedded cost electricity from Fortis’ pre-existing resource stack
while Celgar is selling electricity. This direct restriction on FortisBC indirectly
restricts Celgar. Without access to utility electricity to meet its pulp mill load,
Celgar has no practical choice but to self-supply its own load.

34. Mercer contends secondly that the GBL and related exclusivity provisions in
Section 7.4(b) of Celgar’s 2009 EPA with BC Hydro directly prevent Celgar from

7.63

7.64

7.65

7.66

PUBLIC VERSION

selling any power it generates below its 2007 load, again, not to BC Hydro but to
any third party.”
35. One measure (BCUC Order G-48-09) restricts Celgar’s access to embedded
cost utility electricity; the other measure (BC Hydro’s GBL and related
contractual exclusivity provisions) restricts Celgar sales of below-load self-
generated electricity.”
As regards the first measure, the Tribunal has decided that that the Claimant’s claims
for “discriminatory treatment” based upon NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105(1) in
relation to BCUC Order G-48-09 must be rejected.

As regards the second measure, the Tribunal has decided that it has no jurisdiction over
certain of the Claimant’s claims based upon NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105(1),
by virtue of both the “procurement” exception in NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a) and the
time bars in NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2). As to the merits of this second
measure, the Tribunal has decided to reject the Claimant’s remaining claims for
“discriminatory treatment” resulting from this second measure by virtue of NAFTA

Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105(1).

That leaves for decision only the Claimant’s remaining non-discrimination claims
based upon NAFTA Article 1105(1) in respect of BCUC Order G-48-09 as the third
measure. As indicated above, the Respondent makes no jurisdictional objection to this
particular claim. As to its merits, the Tribunal addresses first the factual premise of this
claim as set out in the quotation from Paragraph 33 of the Claimant’s Reply above,
namely: “BCUC Order G-48-09 imposes a net-of-load access standard on Celgar, by
effectively preventing FortisBC from selling Celgar any embedded cost electricity from

Fortis’ pre-existing resource stack while Celgar is selling electricity”.

BCUC Order G-48-09: The proceedings leading to BCUC Order G-48-09 dated 9 May
2009 were initiated by BC Hydro in relation to two agreements between FortisBC and
the City of Nelson that were filed with the BCUC on 24 June 2008. In the context of
those proceedings, BC Hydro applied to the BCUC for an amendment to the 1993 PPA
between BC Hydro and FortisBC “to clarify that electricity purchased by FortisBC

7.67

7.68

7.69

PUBLIC VERSION

under the PPA cannot be sold to FortisBC customers to replace electricity to be sold by

those customers”.””” BC Hydro’s application was approved by the BCUC.?8

Neither BCUC Order G-48-09, nor the Decision accompanying it, refer explicitly to a
“GBL”. Nonetheless, the BCUC in its Decision made it clear that “self-generators can

still sell ‘excess’ power”?”’. It then sought to clarify what “excess power” means:

“[T]here must be a simple definition of what constitutes “excess power” and we
define that term to mean power “net of load on a dynamic basis.” The
Commission Panel determines that any self-generators, as owners of the
generation facilities, should have the flexibility to reduce domestic load as they
see fit in the commercial circumstances at hand in order to optimize the export of
self-generated power. What will not be permitted is the supply of embedded cost
power to service the domestic load, at any time when the self-generator is selling
power into the market.””*°

The BCUC referred to its previous Order G-38-01 and acknowledged that both the

terms “baseline” and “historical” are used in that order. It continued:

“The Commission Panel believes that in any short term resolution of the policy
issue addressed in this proceeding, there must be some definition for each self-
generator of the historical baseline load served, or, in the alternative, some means
of monitoring, on a dynamic basis, excess self-generation net of load.”*!

The Tribunal notes that this language is not consistent with the establishment of an

inflexible net-of-load standard by the BCUC.

Celgar later appeared to accept that BCUC Order G-48-09 only prevented FortisBC
from selling embedded cost electricity supplied under the 1993 PPA between BC Hydro
and FortisBC: it did not, in other words, prevent FortisBC from selling embedded cost
energy to Celgar from its own resource stack. According to the submission of Celgar’s

lawyers to the BCUC in 2011:

“Order G-48-09 provides that FortisBC will not sell electricity ‘purchased under’
the PPA to Celgar, while Celgar sells self-generation that is not in excess of its

277 Order G-48-09, Recital F.

load. It does not prohibit FortisBC from selling other energy to Celgar, while

Celgar sells such self-generation.”?°?

On that basis, Celgar requested the BCUC to set a GBL in its service agreement with
FortisBC:

“Celgar seeks a FortisBC GBL that does not rely upon additional utilization of

3808 power by FortisBC to serve Celgar’s proposed increased firm energy

requirements while Cclgar sells self-generation that is not in excess of load.”
The BCUC ultimately declined to establish a GBL for the service agreement between
Celgar and FortisBC, preferring to leave this to the contracting parties themselves.?**
It nonetheless affirmed Celgar’s right to access at least some of Fortis BC’s non-PPA
embedded cost power in its Decision accompanying Order G-188-11 and would be free

to arbitrage that embedded cost power:

“Given that Celgar has entitlement to some amount of FortisBC non-PPA
embedded cost power, it follows that Celgar would be allowed to sell such power
to third parties unless specifically precluded by doing so by contract with
FortisBC. That is, such non-PPA power could be exposed to the potential for
arbitrage, subject to the terms of an agreement between FortisBC and Celgar
which would require Commission approval.

[...] [I]t is evident that Celgar is free to sell all or a portion of its generation
below the BC Hydro GBL into the market and supply its mill from FortisBC
resources, not including BC Hydro PPA Power.”?*>
The BCUC also confirmed that: “Order G-48-09 does not consider power from
FortisBC’s own generation or other non-BC Hydro PPA Power components of its

resource stack.”?°

FortisBC also shared this view of the regulatory landscape in its letter dated 13 April
2012 to the BCUC: 8”

“FortisBC concludes... that there will be power generated by Celgar, below the
BC Hydro GBL of 40 MW, available for sale that will be replaced from FortisBC

resources. The amount, whether Celgar chooses to self-supply all or no power to
its mill, is immaterial in the face of proper pricing. [FortisBC] is of the opinion
that the [BCUC] has established the principle that arbitrage of FortisBC non-

PPA power is not prohibited out of hand.”

 

Mr Merwin (of Celgar) proclaimed Order G-188-1 to be a “major victory” at the time
in his memorandum of 7 December 2011 to Mercer’s Board of Directors.”** He stated
that the BCUC had confirmed that “Celgar is able to buy all of its power requirements

from FortisBC and free to sell the output of all of its generation to third parties.”?°?

This interpretation of Order G-188-1 was confirmed by the BCUC in its subsequent
Decision of 27 December 2012 accompanying Order G-202-12. It summarised the
entitlements of customers of FortisBC: “[The] entitlement to non-BC Hydro PPA
embedded cost power by a self-generating customer may be as high as 100 percent of

load as nominated by that customer”.?°°

The Tribunal’s Analysis on BCUC Order G-48-09

In the Tribunal’s view, on the evidence before it, the Claimant falls short of establishing
that BCUC Order G-48-09 or any associated aspect of the BCUC’s regulatory regime
breaches the customary international law standard of treatment under NAFTA Article
1105(1), as explained in the NAFTA award in Merill & Ring v Canada. The Claimant
has not established irrationality, injustice, arbitrariness, or a violation of due process

within the meaning of the customary international law standard.

As to transparency, it suffices to cite the Cargill Award cited above, in which the
tribunal decided that the customary international law standard had not yet been shown
to embrace a claim to transparency.”*! The Tribunal also notes that the tribunal in Merill
& Ring decided that transparency was not part of the customary international law
standard.” In any event, even if applicable, the Tribunal would not be inclined to

decide that the Claimant’s case reaches the threshold for non-transparency.

PUBLIC VERSION

As to arbitrariness, the International Court of Justice’s judgment in ELS/ decided, in a
well-known passage, that: “Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule
of law, as something opposed to the rule of law... it is willful disregard of due process
of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises a sense of judicial propriety.”?°> The
present case, in the Tribunal’s view, is not shown to amount to such “willful disregard”

by BC Hydro or the BCUC.

More specifically, it is clear from the contemporaneous documents produced by the
BCUC, Celgar, FortisBC and BC Hydro that BCUC Order G-48-09 did not “prevent []
FortisBC from selling Celgar any embedded cost electricity from Fortis’ pre-existing
resource stack while Celgar is selling electricity” [Emphasis here supplied].?°* Such
prevention is the factual premise for the Claimant’s claim, as to which it bore the legal
burden of proof. Indeed, as the Respondent pointed out, Celgar acquired a right that no
other mill in British Columbia had, which was the ability to sell all of its self-generation
below its GBL to the market and to supply its Mill from FortisBC resources so long as

that supply did not include BC Hydro supply to FortisBC under their PPAs.?°°

Lastly, as regards the FPS provision in NAFTA Article 1105(1), it is not entirely clear
whether or not the Claimant, by its several references to NAFTA Article 1105(1) is
advancing a claim under this FPS provision. Assuming such a claim were advanced,
the Tribunal considers that this FPS provision addresses a third person causing harm to
the Claimant, other than the Respondent (or persons whose acts are attributable to the
Respondent under international law). There is no malign third person in this case.

Hence, such claim could not succeed on the facts of the present case.

Conclusion: For these several reasons, as regards BCUC Order G-48-09, the Tribunal

dismisses the Claimant’s remaining claims under NAFTA Article 1105(1).

The Tribunal (by a majority) emphasises that it has in this Part 7 of the Award only
addressed the Claimant’s claims under NAFTA Article 1105(1), as it must, under the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens within the

confines of the FTC Interpretation and the particular wording of NAFTA Article 1105

interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of

Treaties.
NAFTA Article 1503(2)

The Tribunal has decided that the Respondent’s treatment of Celgar was not contrary
to provisions of NAFTA Chapter 11. As already indicated above, even assuming its
application, it is therefore unnecessary to address further NAFTA Article 1503(2). That
provides for the Respondent's liability if it failed to “ensure” that BC Hydro and/or the
BCUC did not act contrary to NAFTA Chapter 11. In the Tribunal’s view, no such act
was committed by BC Hydro or the BCUC towards the Claimant, ZCL or ZCLP.

Conclusion

In summary, for the reasons above, the Tribunal (by a majority) has decided that the
Respondent has not violated NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105(1). Nor did BC
Hydro. It therefore follows that the Respondent also did not violate Article 1503(2)
(even assuming its application as a matter of jurisdiction) by failing to ensure that BC

Hydro did not act contrary to NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105(1).

The Tribunal (by a majority) therefore dismisses on the merits as to liability all the
Claimant’s remaining claims under NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103, 1105 and 1503. It
follows that no issues related to compensation under these provisions requires the
decision of the Tribunal and, also, that the Claimant’s claims for compensation and its

related claims for interest are dismissed.

Dissent: Arbitrator Orrego Vicufia’s reading of the NAFTA Articles discussed from
Paragraph 7.76 onwards is different. First, because the concept of a comparator is
broader than that followed by the majority; and it also includes cases that do not need
to be identical. The proper comparison is between cases where the treatment is different

in respect of activities of a similar nature, which is very much the case here.

It follows that also the concept of discrimination is broader than that considered in the
Award. Intentional or unintentional, the different treatment is sufficient to prove
discrimination in the instant case, whichever the technicalities of the GBL’s different

calculations. Having already excluded the considerations relating to procurement, it is

7.88

7.89

7.90

PUBLIC VERSION

not necessary for this Arbitrator to discuss the Award’s reasoning in respect of Article

1105 in this connection.

The majority also supports the view that no breach of the customary standard of
required treatment is involved in this case. To consider the nature of the specific
breaches alleged it is sufficient to establish its connection or disconnection with the
customary law standard of treatment. Under current international law it is not possible
to exclude discrimination as one kind of breach of the required treatment, a proposition

that seems to be generally accepted today.

In this respect the interpretation of the FTC on the meaning of international minimum
treatment is not in contradiction with the views of this arbitrator on this case. The FTC
interpretation on this matter, particularly as it concerns discrimination, does not
condone mistreatment of the investor. While in some respects the FTC interpretation
could be seen as tantamount to a freeze of customary law in time, it is not the case here.
The minimum treatment and non-discrimination are among the first standards accepted
as customary law since the outset of the jurisprudence governing this matter. The role
of a comparator has not meaningfully changed either. It follows that when the same
policy has been taken up by the fair and equitable treatment standard, no contradiction

can be found with the international minimum standard.

In this connection, the possibility of submitting a claim under Article 1105 is not limited
by the issue of procurement and could also allow for claims relating to more favourable
treatment. In summary, while this arbitrator can agree to parts of the arguments in
respect of Articles 1102 and 1103, under Article 1105(1) the situation is different. Fair
and equitable treatment is a fundamental tool for the understanding of current
international law, certainly in respect of investments. This arbitrator believes we should

safeguard this element.

PART VII: SUMMARY OF DECISIONS

Introduction

For ease of reference and as a fuller explanation of the Operative Part of this Award,

the Tribunal briefly summarises the several decisions made earlier in this Award.
Jurisdiction and Admissibility

The Tribunal confirms that it has jurisdiction and may exercise jurisdiction over the
Claimant’s claims concerning BCUC Order G-48-09 (subject to its working assumption

as regards NAFTA Article 1503(2) as summarised below).

The Tribunal (by a majority) decides that it has no jurisdiction to decide the Claimant’s
claims concerning the 2009 EPA between Celgar and BC Hydro under NAFTA Articles
1102, 1103 and 1105, by reason of NAFTA Articles 1116(2), 1117(2) and 1180(7)(a),
save only insofar as these claims allege “discriminatory treatment” under NAFTA

Article 1105 (as advocated by the Claimant).

The Tribunal leaves open arguendo, as regards jurisdiction and admissibility, the
Respondent’s objection under NAFTA Article 1503(2). In the event, even assuming
such jurisdiction for the purpose of deciding the merits of the Claimant’s claims, this

objection requires no adjudication by the Tribunal for the purpose of this Award.
Merits of Remaining Claims

Liability: The Tribunal (by a majority) dismisses the Claimant’s remaining claims as to
which it has and may exercise jurisdiction; namely: (i) the Claimant’s claims relating
to BCUC Order G-48-09 under NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103, 1105 and (ii) the
Claimant’s claims relating to “discriminatory treatment” by reference to Celgar’s GBL
under NAFTA Article 1105. The Tribunal (by a majority) also dismisses the Claimant’s
claims under NAFTA Article 1503(2) as to their merits, on the jurisdictional

assumption described above.

Compensation: As a result of the Tribunal’s decisions on jurisdiction, admissibility and
liability, the Claimant’s claims for compensation are moot; and the Tribunal therefore

dismisses them.

Interest: As a result of the Tribunal’s decisions on jurisdiction, admissibility, liability
and compensation, the Claimant’s claims for interest are moot; and the Tribunal

therefore dismisses them.

Relief: As to the Claimant’s requests for relief in its Request, Memorial and Reply (set
out in Part II(D) above), the Tribunal dismisses such requests, save only as to costs

(considered separately in Part IX below).

As to the Respondent’s requests for relief in its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder (as
also set out in Part II(D) above, the Tribunal grants such requests save only as to costs

(considered separately in Part IX below).

PART IX: LEGAL AND ARBITRATION COSTS

Introduction

In this Part IX of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the issues of costs, both arbitration

costs (“Arbitration Costs”) and the legal and other costs of the Parties (“Legal Costs’).

The Parties have addressed these issues in their respective submissions on costs;
namely: (i) the Claimant’s initial submission on costs of 15 March 2016; (ii) the
Respondent’s initial submission on costs of 15 March 2016; (iii) the Claimant’s
supplemental submission on costs of 3 April 2017; and (iv) the Respondent’s updated

costs statement also of 3 April 2017.
The Tribunal’s Discretion as to Costs

Under Part IV of the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No 1, as agreed by the Parties, the
applicable arbitration rules are the ICSID AF Arbitration Rules except to the extent that
they are modified by Section B of NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

NAFTA Article 1135(1) provides: “A tribunal may also award costs in accordance with
the applicable arbitration rules”. Article 52(1)(j) of the ICSID AF Arbitration Rules
requires the Tribunal to have its Award contain “any decision of the Tribunal regarding
the cost of the proceeding.” Article 58(1) of the ICSID AF Arbitration Rules further

provides:

“Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom
the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges
of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the
proceeding shall be borne ...”
(Article 58(2) of the ICSID AF Arbitration Rules also requires the Tribunal’s decision
under this sub-paragraph (1) to form part of the Award.)

In these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it has broad discretionary powers to
decide in this Award: (i) the allocation and assessment of Legal Costs (i.e. the legal fees
and other expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with this arbitration); and (ii)
the allocation of Arbitration Costs (i.e. the fees and expenses of the members of the

Tribunal, and the expenses and charges of the ICSID Secretariat)

The Parties’ Costs Submissions

The Claimant’s Costs Submissions: In its submissions on costs, the Claimant submits
that the Respondent should bear the total Arbitration Costs and pay all the Legal Costs

incurred by the Claimant; namely:
Arbitration Costs (paid by way of advances to ICSID): US$ 425,000; and
Legal Costs: US$ 11,483,376.64 plus CAN$ 1,254,961.

The Respondent’s Costs Submissions: In its submissions on costs, the Respondent
submits that the Claimant should bear all the Arbitration Costs and pay all the Legal

Costs incurred the Respondent; namely:

Arbitration Costs (paid by way of advances to ICSID): CAN$ 492,182.50 (then
equivalent to US$425,000); and

Legal Costs: CAN$ 9,154,166.56.
The Tribunal’s Decision on Legal Costs

The Parties have each criticised the other for malign and other mischievous conduct in
this arbitration, thereby unnecessarily complicating the arbitration, with consequential
delays and additional expenses. It is unnecessary, given the Tribunal’s decision below,

to summarise such criticism here.

In the Tribunal’s view, there was no misconduct in the conduct of this arbitration
attributable to either Party. Both the Claimant’s claims and the Respondent’s defences
were reasonably advanced, in good faith. In particular, the Claimant’s claims were not
“frivolous”, as alleged by the Respondent. To the extent that there were innocent
mishaps and delays, these are unfortunately a common feature of many complicated
arbitrations with much at stake for both sides. Moreover, the Parties’ dispute was not
only complicated, it was also difficult. The absence in this Award of unanimous
agreement by the Tribunal on several important issues speaks for itself. Accordingly,
the Tribunal rejects each Party’s criticisms of the other Party’s conduct in this
arbitration. No part of the Tribunal’s decisions on costs should be understood, therefore,

as having any punitive element.

PUBLIC VERSION

As to the allocation of Legal Costs, the Tribunal decides that the paramount factor
should be the overall success of the Parties in the arbitration. As to that, given the result
of this Award, there is no doubt that the Respondent is the successful party and the
Claimant is the unsuccessful party. Thus, in principle, the Claimant should not recover

its Legal Costs; and the Respondent should recover its Legal Costs from the Claimant.

As to the assessment of the Respondent’s Legal Costs (addressed below) the Tribunal
decides to grant the Respondent’s claim for Legal Costs in the total amount of CAN$
9,000,000.00. As to this amount, the Tribunal considers that the sums claimed by the
Respondent are reasonable and were reasonably incurred, particularly given the much

greater sums incurred by the Claimant (as to more than 35%).
The Tribunal’s Decision on Arbitration Costs

These Arbitration Costs are broken down as follows:

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

President (Mr Veeder): US$ 200,529.77
Professor Orrego Vicufia: US$ 143,851.45
Professor Douglas: US$ 108,959.40
Other direct expenses: US$ 107,658.30
ICSID’s administrative fees US$ 202,000.00
Total US$ 762,998.92

 

As aresult, each Party’s share of the Arbitration Costs paid amounts to US$ 381,499.46.

As to allocation, the Tribunal decides to follow its approach to Legal Costs, with a
relatively minor modification. Whilst the Respondent was overall the successful party
as regards the result of this arbitration, it did not succeed on every issue, particularly
important issues of jurisdiction. The Tribunal considers, therefore, that its decision on

Arbitration Costs should reflect, as to such issues, the relative success of the Claimant.

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that each Party should bear its own Arbitration Costs,

without recourse to the other Party.

As to Legal Costs, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant shall pay to the Respondent
the total amount of CAN$ 9,000,000.00.

As to Arbitration Costs, the Tribunal decides that each Party should bear its own

Arbitration Costs, without recourse to the other Party.

PART X: THE OPERATIVE PART

For the reasons set out above in this Award, the Tribunal decides and awards as follows:

As to jurisdiction and admissibility, the Tribunal declares that it has jurisdiction and
may exercise such jurisdiction to decide the merits of: (i) the Claimant’s claims (for
itself and ZCL) alleging “discriminatory treatment concerning Celgar’s GBL” (with,
arguendo, NAFTA Article 1503(2)) and (ii) the Claimant’s claims (for itself and ZCL)
concerning BCUC Order G-48-09, under NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105(1);

Save as aforesaid, the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections are upheld;

As to the merits of the claims made by the Claimant (for itself and ZCL), alleging
“discriminatory treatment’ concerning Celgar’s GBL, the Tribunal dismisses all such

claims under NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103, 1105(1) and 1503(2);

As to the merits of the claims made by the Claimant (for itself and ZCL), concerning
BCUC Order G-48-09, the Tribunal dismisses all such claims under NAFTA Articles
1102, 1103, and 1105(1);

In consequence of the dismissals above as to the merits, the Tribunal dismisses the

claims by the Claimant (for itself and ZCL) for compensation and interest;
