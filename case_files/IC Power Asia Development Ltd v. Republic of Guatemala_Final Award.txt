THE 2011 TRANSACTION

Actis acquired Energuate from Union Fenosa Internacional, S.A. (“Fenosa”) in 2011 through a
specific form of reverse merger leveraged buyout (“LBO”) referred to as a ‘reverse triangular

merger’ (the “2011 Transaction”).'*

A reverse triangular merger typically involves three entities: the target company, the acquirer, and
a wholly owned subsidiary of the acquirer. The wholly owned subsidiary is often an entity created
for the specific purpose of the transaction. This vehicle entity merges with the target company,
with the latter becoming the surviving entity. In so doing, the target company becomes a wholly

owned subsidiary of the acquirer. '®

Actis retained Ernst & Young (“EY”) to perform “certain tax structuring services in connection
with [its] contemplated acquisition of [DEORSA], [DEOCSA]. Generacién Limpia Guatemala,
S.A., [Guatemel] and [Recsa] (“Target”)”.'”

The strategy recommended by EY included incorporating five companies in the Netherlands that
would be indirectly controlled by Actis (together, the “Dutch SPVs”).'* Three of those companies

would acquire Generacién Limpia Guatemala, $.A., Guatemel! and Recsa, respectively.!? The

On5 April 2011, DEOCSA, B.V. and DEORSA, B.V. incorporated two companies in Guatemala:

as follows took place.

On 19 May 2011, two Share Purchase Agreements (“SPAs”) were signed in New York. Pursuant
to the first SPA, Fenosa sold its shares in the Target to the Dutch SPVs.™ Following the
conclusion of the first SPA, DEOCSA, B.V. and DEORSA, B.V. sold their shares in the
Distributors to the Guatemalan SPVs under the second SPA.”*

On the same date, the Guatemalan SPVs signed a series of syndicated Joans managed by Banco
Agromercantil (the “Syndicated Loans”),” receiving a joint sum of US$ 220 million.2” On the

TAX IMPLICATIONS OF THE 2011 TRANSACTION

L Tax Regulations in Guatemala

According to the Claimant, the 2011 Transaction generated two tax deductions: (i) the
amortization of the goodwill obtained by the Distributors as a result of the Transaction; and (ii) a
deduction for interest expenses on the loans used to acquire the Distributors (the “Tax

Deductions”).

The Respondent considers that the Tax Deductions were not allowable under Guatemalan law:
the 2011 Transaction did not imply any contribution of money, assets, or experience to the

Distributors and was structured with the sole purpose of “fabricating a tax credit in Guatemala”.**

(a) Reverse Triangular Merger
The Claimant's Position

According to the Claimant, LBOs have been widely used by private equity firms to invest in the
infrastructure sector, and the reverse triangular merger has been referred to as the “most

commonly used acquisition technique”.

the price had already been paid to Fenosa on 17 May 2011, two days before the signature of the contract

In conducting the 2011 Transaction, the Claimant notes, Actis was advised by “leading tax and
legal professionals”, including Clifford Chance, EY and Guatemala’s Consortium Legal (or
RACSA).» The Claimant also notes that the banks that were approached to provide the necessary

financing “expressed comfort with the transaction”.*¢

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contention that the 2011 Transaction was designed to
“fabricate” the Tax Deductions, and refers in this regard to (i) the advice provided by Consortium
Legal, which notes that a reverse merger was required to maintain the operating license of the
Target;” (ii) the testimony of Mr. Albin (former CFO of the Distributors), according to whom the
2011 Transaction sought to maintain the conditions imposed to obtain the necessary bank loan,
which required the reverse merger so as to transfer the debt to the Distributors;** and (iii) the
opinion of its expert, the Brattle Group, positing that the survival of the Distributors was necessary
due to the significant number of contracts, licenses, permits or real estate deeds that they required

to operate.*?

Similarly, the Claimant rejects the notion that EY was retained to advice on how to “fabricate”
the Tax Deductions, and notes that EY examined the potential tax implications of the 2011

Transaction in determining that the proposed transaction was legally sound.*”

The Respondent's Position

According to the Respondent, the 2011 Transaction was unlawful under Guatemalan law. This
alleged unlawfulness does not lie solely in the fact that it was structured through an LBO;"' rather,
its illegality lies in the manner in which Actis structured the Transaction to fabricate “unjustified
and exorbitant” tax deductions in favour of the Guatemalan SPVs, and to the detriment of the

Guatemalan tax authorities.”

In particular, the Respondent avers that the sole purpose of the May 2011 SPAs was to allow “the
Guatemalan SPVs to record in their accounting books a line item for an intangible asset called
“Goodwill’”, which was caiculated as the difference between the price of the shares acquired in
the 201] Transaction and the shares’ nominal value.** Such recording of goodwill would later
allow the creation of a purported tax deduction corresponding to its amortization.’ In turn, the
reverse triangular merger would serve to transfer the ownership of the Tax Deductions to the

Distributors. **

(b) Allowable Deductions in Guatemala
The Claimant's Position

According to the Claimant, Guatemalan law permitted deductions for interest expenses and the
amortization of goodwill in calculating taxable income."* Those deductions were applicable to
the Distributors’ “incurred interest expense” and the goodwill asset obtained as a result of the

2011 Transaction.*”

According to the Claimant, the purpose of the Syndicated Loans “was to invest in stock and
generate income for the shareholders, and considering that interest is paid from the cash flow
generated by the company in the ordinary course of business, it can be technically and legally

concluded that such interest is associated with taxable income in Guatemala.”

The Respondent's Position

According to the Respondent, Actis led the Distributors to record exorbitant Tax Deductions in
their books to defraud taxes,” while the 2011 Transaction did not generate any of the expenses

or costs which may give rise to tax deductions.

The Respondent notes that taxpayers registered in the Tax System for Gainful Activities, as is the
case of the Distributors, are required to pay income tax calculated on the basis of their taxable
income.*! Guatemalan tax law allows taxpayers to deduct from their gross income duly
documented costs and expenses which are “useful, necessary, relevant or indispensable to produce

or preserve the source of taxable income” in Guatemala.” The Respondent refers to domestic and

Furthermore, the Respondent notes that taxpayers must maintain full accounting records in
accordance with the provisions of the Tax Update Law in order to deduct costs and expenses.**
Accordingly, taxpayers must provide the documents and means of support required by the Tax
Update Law with regard to deductions, which must meet the accounting criteria set out in the

Commercial Code.**

The Respondent acknowledges that Guatemalan law allows deductions of interest payments.
However, to be deductible, the loans in question must have been used in transactions that generate

taxable income for the taxpayer.**

The Respondent also acknowledges that Guatemalan law allows the deduction of depreciation

and amortization of a taxpayer's intangible assets, which include goodwill actually incurred.” It

notes, however, that such possibility is also conditioned to their use for the generation of taxable

income.**

As to the specifics of the 2011 Transaction, the Respondent notes, first, that goodwill corresponds

(o 96% of the 2011 Transaction’s value.* The Respondent’s expert, Compass Lexecon, considers

 

that such p is “clearly when P to the tatios that can be
justified in a similar transaction’. Such percentage is even more “scandalous”, in the
Respondent’s view, considering the absence of documentation justifying goodwill, which is a
fundamental requirement under Guatemalan tax law for its deductibility.“' In the Respondent’s
view, such absence suggests that the difference in value was artificial and its only purpose was to

generate a large asset that could be used to record amortization costs reducing income tax.”

The Respondent also refers to the Distributors’ 2015 correction of their goodwill calculations,

which was based on a dividend discount model® and resulted in goodwill amounting to 60% of

 

the price paid in the 2011 T: i According to the R dent, such p is still

above the ratio expected in similar transactions.“

In addition to the goodwill asset being undocumented, the Respondent submits that the Claimant

has also failed to establish how “a supposed asset created using a mere arithmetic operation based

on arbitrarily established premises[] was able to generate taxable income in Guatemala”, which,

as noted above, is a legal requirement for its deductibility.

In relation to the interest payment deductions, the Respondent affirms that the Syndicated Loans
were only used as consideration for Fenosa’s shares in the Target.“ In the Respondent’s
submission, the Distributors attempted to disguise this fact by indicating to the SAT that “the
credit was used to finance a going concern”;*” however, the Guatemalan SPVs never generated

any taxable income in Guatemala.

Finally, the Respondent notes that the Claimant has initiated an arbitration against its insurer,
AIG, for breach of representations and warranties by Actis. In particular, the Claimant invoked
the representations that the Distributors were in compliance with all laws and that all due taxes
had been paid.”

2. Tax Audit of the Distributors by SAT

The SAT is responsible for inspecting tax collection in accordance with the internal regulations
governing the Tax Audit Planning and Execution Procedure, the Tax Code and the Organic Law
of the SAT.”

In April 2012, the Distributors filed with the SAT their financial statements for 201 1, which
detailed the accounting treatment of the reverse merger.”' According to the Claimant, at the time,
the Distributors were completely transparent with the SAT in relation to the 2011 Transaction and

the Tax Deductions.”

On 19 April and 25 May 2012, the Head of Management and Collection Division of SAT
(Divisién de Recaudacién) suggested to the Inspection Supervisor (Intendente de Fiscalizacién)
to include the Distributors within the audit schedule to determine whether they had properly
performed their tax obligations (the “Tax Audit”).” Such request was based on the significant
decrease in collection for the period January to March 2012 in comparison with the previous tax

year.”

    

By several official notices issued in October and November 2012, the Head of Taxation Division

 

of Special Taxpayers (Jefe de Division de Fiscalizacion, Gerencia de Contribuyentes Especiales

Grandes) appointed two teams of auditors to verify whether the Distributors had fulfilled their

In March 2013, the Distributors filed their financial statements for the year 2012 with the SAT.
Those statements also reflected deductions for interest and goodwill amortization as a result of

the 2011 Transaction. *?

On 19 September 2013, the Taxation Bureau considered it relevant to extend the Tax Audit to tax
year 2012." The SAT appointed additional auditors and expanded the scope of the Tax Audit to
the period between | January 2011 and 31 December 2012.4

In September 2013, the SAT served several information requests to the Distributors in relation to
tax years 2011 and 2012.

On 12 December 2013 and on 17 February 2014, the Auditing Teams issued reports with their
findings (the “Audit Reports”).* The teams found several inconsistencies justifying adjustments
in the Distributors’ income tax returns and in their value added tax and solidarity tax returns.”

and interest payments were inadmissible. In relation to the 2011 Transaction, the Auditor Team
considered that “[t]he main objective of the taxpayer was to create the intangible asset

[v-e., Goodwill] and the loan, to decrease its Taxable Income”.”!
On 18 February 2014, the SAT reopened the Tax Audit in relation to DEOCSA.”

On 27 March 2014, the Taxation Division of SAT (Divisién de Fiscatizacién, Gerencia de
Contribuyentes Especiales Grandes) notified the Distributors that, as a result of the Tax Audit,
the SAT had formulated certain adjustments that could be challenged within thirty working days
from such notification (“SAT Hearings Notifications”).” Said adjustments primarily concerned

the Distributors’ Tax Deductions for interest and goodwill amortizations.”

In relation to the goodwill amortization, the Taxation Division noted that, in response to the Audit
Teams’ requests, the Distributors’ accountant had acknowledged the absence of any feasibility
study regarding the acquisition of the ongoing business.” In such circumstances, the Audit Teams

concluded

.. that value which the taxpayer indicates it has overpaid for the purchase of the acquired
entity’s capital cannot be considered as goodwill, [given that] the same taxpayer
acknowledges that it does not have a feasibility study regarding the purchase of business, and
that it can neither include nor document the purchase price of said business.%

The SAT Hearings Notifications further noted that the purported goodwill did not meet the

The Claimant underscores that, in the Resolutions Division’s report of 18 June 2014, the Division
expressed the view that there was a “weak administrative case and would likely lose in Court”

when conveying the importance of sending the file to the Department of Legal Affairs. '°?

On the other hand, the Respondent submits that said reports fail to indicate why the administrative

proceedings were purportedly “unsustainable” and, in any event, claims that “the merits of the

p i bear no i i to the merits of the criminal tax

proceedings”.

On 14 July and 8 August 2014, the Department of Legal Affairs twice declined to recommend the

 

ion of a criminal prosecution, noting that at such moment in time “it [wa]s not possible to
initiate a crimina! prosecution, because the report on the merits does not establish a causal link as
required under article 10 of the Penal Code”. *™

On 12 November 2014, the Resolutions Division analysed the Distributors’ objections and sent a

report with its recommendations to the Head of the Taxation Division.’*

Such report
recommended the annulment of the SAT Hearings Notifications, the notification of anew hearing,
and the transmission of the file to the Department of Legal Affairs so that the latter may assess

whether on the basis of the new elements a criminal prosecution was possible. '°°

On 13 November 2014, the SAT issued resolutions nuilifying the SAT Hearings Notifications

The Annulment Resolutions resolved as follows:

I. TO DECLARE THE NULLITY of the Hearing No. [A-2014-21-01-000030 / A-2014-
21-01-000056, respectively] of 26 March 2014 and its respective notification, carried
out on 27 March 2014 to the contributor [DEOCSA / DEORSA, respectively], leaving
without effect all procedural steps taken after the notification of the above-referenced
hearing, without affecting the efficacy of the evidence rendered in due time by the
contributor.

2. To grant a new Hearing according to the legal formalities to the contributor [DEOCSA
/ DEORSA, respectively].

The Parties disagree as to the effects of the Annulment Resolutions. The Claimant avers that the
resolutions “nullified the entirety of the adjustments, without making any distinction”.'
According to the Respondent, the Annulment Resolutions only annulled the SAT Hearings
Notifications through which the SAT notified the adjustments to the Distributors but did not affect
the actions which took place prior to the SAT Hearings Notifications.''' The Respondent further
contends that “the breach of the essential procedural requirements which according to the SAT
could entail potential violations of the Distributors’ due process and right to defense had no

169. The Tax Opinion Requests put the following consults ta the SAT:

a. Is it valid, is it technically and legaily correct and, thus, applicable, to apply the method of
“future discounted dividend” to determine the value of the shares acquired by the Buyer
which, as was set out, on the basis of | and id

applied, results in a value of...? And, as a consequence, would this be the value to be
deducted from the Price in order to determine the amount of goodwill amortization under
articles 26 of Decree 26-92 of the Congress of the Republic and its amendments and 33 of
Decree 10-2012 of the Congress of the Republic, since its entering into force?

b. Is it deductible the amount of interests paid in relation to the Credit, irrespective of the
juridical acts described in section “B” above and as a result of which the Credit has become
a passive of the Distributor, within the limits of Articles 38 letter “m” of Decree 26-92 of the
Congress of the Republic and its amendments and article 21 section 16 and article 24, of
Decree 10-2012 of the Congress of the Republic, since its entering into force?!2!

176. On 9 February 2015, the SAT issued the binding tax opinions (the “Binding Tax Opinions”).!”2

The Binding Tax Opinions concluded, in relevant part, as follows:

That, according to the provisions that regulate the Guatemalan tax system, taxpayers shall
keep accounting records in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles so
that the discounted future dividend method used by the taxpaying entity, [Deocsa], is not
expressly regulated by the tax provisions. However, its use is technically correct within the
applicable legal framework as analyzed in the section on Legal Analysis, Consequently, the
value of the acquired shares indicated in the query, calculated using the Future Dividend
Discount Model, is the value to be deducted from the Price to determine the amount of
amortizable goodwill according to articles 26 of Decree 2692 of the Congress of the Republic
and amendments (for fiscal years 2011 and 2012}, and 33 of Decree 10-2012 of the Congress
of the Republic, B) Regarding the interest resulting from credit acquired by the
aforementioned entity, pursuant to articles 38, letter m) of Decree number 26-92; and 21,
numbers 16 and 24 of Decree number 10-2012, both of the Congress of the Republic, and the
limitations established therein, its deduction is appropriate provided that it is supported and
documented according to the section on legal analysis.

Pursuant to Article 102 of the Tax Code, the answer to the query made by the interested party
cannot be resolved, disputed, or appealed in any way and only has a binding effect for the
Tax Administration regarding this specifically consulted case. '?*

The Claimant's Position

According to the Claimant, the Tax Opinion Requests were submitted by the Distributors because
they wanted to obtain “certainty and finality regarding the Deductions”.'**

In the Claimant’s view, the Tax Opinion Requests were another occasion on which the
Distributors provided the SAT with information regarding the 2011 Transaction, of which the
SAT was already “fully aware”, as was the case with regard to the Tax Deductions on the basis
of “extensive information that the Distributors had provided the SAT in response to its
information requests, but also because the Distributors and the SAT had discussed the possibility

of the Distributors seeking tax opinions from the SAT”. '7°

The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent’s contention that the Distributors concealed
information.'”° According to the Claimant, had any information been missing, the SAT would
have requested it or else it would not have rendered the opinions.” In particular, the Claimant is
of the view that, at that time, such matters were no longer subject to verification or audits and
“the audits were annulled as of November 2014, leaving nothing to disclose”.!"* In any event,
the Claimant denies that the Distributors would have had a duty to inform the Consulting
Department about such proceedings. '”

The Claimant further recalls that the SAT had 10 days to revoke the Binding Tax Opinions, and
that, absent such revocation, they became binding for the SAT.'*° Further, the Binding Tax

Opinions could have been, but were not, revoked through a contentious-administrative procedure
initiated within three years of their issuance based on a declaration by the President of Guatemala
whereby the act was declared injurious to the national interests.'*! Therefore, the Binding Tax

Opinions remain valid and unchallenged to date. *

As a result, in the Claimant’s submission, the Binding Tax Opinions confirmed that “the
Distributors were legally entitied to interest and goodwill amortization deductions arising from
Actis’s 2011 Transaction”.'** In this respect, the Claimant’s expert, Mr. Martinez Guzman,
suggests that the Binding Tax Opinions did not condition the deductibility of the Tax Deductions
“to the compliance of the legal requisites for its deduction. In fact, an opinion in such sense would
be contrary to the purpose of a binding opinion since it would only redirect the taxpayer to what

is already on the law”.

Similarly, the Claimant’s expert, Mr. Donado argues that, under
Guatemalan law, the Binding Tax Opinions “can indeed relate to events which already

occurred”, "3°

Finally, the Claimant notes that the SAT has not brought proceedings against the Distributors

alleging tax fraud in relation to the Binding Tax Opinions, '**

The Respondent's Position

In the Respondent’s view, the submission of the Tax Opinion Requests was an attempt by the
Distributors to eliminate the signs of tax fraud detected by the Taxation Division during the Tax.
Audit.”

According to the Respondent, the Distributors concealed information in their Tax Opinion
Requests and misrepresented the 2011 Transaction.'* In particular, the Distributors allegedly
concealed the fact that the Taxation Division had already determined that the Tax Deductions

were not permissible."

The Respondent refers in this regard to Article 102 of the Tax Code, pursuant to which the SAT
has no obligation to verify the veracity of the taxpayer’s statements or to consult with other SAT
units regarding the existence of any proceedings against the taxpayer in relation to the particular
case.'"* The Respondent further notes that the Auditing Teams were not aware of the Tax Opinion
Requests and had to request a copy of the Binding Tax Opinions from the Legal Affairs

Department, which were received on 11 August 2015."

In any event, the Binding Tax Opinions stated that the deduction of any cost er expense was
contingent on it being duly documented and its ability to generate taxable income in Guatemala. 4?
Thus, the Respondent disputes the Claimant's allegation that the Binding Tax Opinions authorised

or confirmed any entitlement to the Tax Deductions. '"*

Moreover, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s assertion that the Binding Tax Opinions have
the status of a resolution or are “analogous to a court’s judgement”. in this respect, Article 102
of the Tax Code establishes that the SAT’s binding opinions “do not have the quality of a
ruling”.'*° Therefore, the Respondent argues, Article 154 of the Tax Code, which regulates the
reversal of rulings by the administration, is not applicable to binding opinions.“ Similarly,

binding opinions are not susceptible to annulment by judicial review.""”

4, Rectification Payments

On 19 February 2015, shortly after the issuance of the Binding Tax Opinions, the Distributors
submitted a series of rectifications payments in relation to their tax declarations for the years 201]
to 2013 (the “Reetification Payments”).

On 27 February 2015, a representative from the Distributors met with SAT officials of the
Taxation and Collection Departments to discuss the Rectification Payments.’ The SAT’s

the effect that the Rectification Payments were made taking into account the Binding Tax
Opinions (the “SAT Rectification Payments Minutes”).'*°

Certain SAT internal reports to the SAT’s Chief of the Audit Division for Special Large
Taxpayers dated 21 September 2015 (the “SAT Internal Reports”) recommended an audit of the
Distributors’ Rectification Payments in relation to the fiscal years 2011 to 2013.'*"

On 9 November 2015, the Distributors’ files were sent to the General Archive of the SAT’s

General Secretary.'**

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant notes that the SAT Rectification Payments Minutes do not reflect any disagreement
by the SAT officials with the representations made by the Distributors’ representative during the

27 February 2015 meeting. '**

The Claimant underscores that SAT officials did not continue the Tax Audit, nor did they open
any new administrative procedure against the Distributors.’ Similarly, no requests for

clarification were issued to the Distributors."

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contention that the meetings recorded in the SAT
Rectification Payments Minutes were irregular: according to Mr. Donado, since its creation the
SAT had always had “an open door policy with taxpayers; it was very commen to have meetings

with 3 or 4 heads of relevant departments.”"® Mr. Donado points out that it was not until mid-

forbidden”. '*?

The Respondent's Position

According to the Respondent, the Rectification Payments were calculated arbitrarily by the
Distributors and did not follow any established procedure.'* Contrary to the Claimant’s
contention that such meetings were common, Mr. Menéndez and Mr. Mufioz assert that in more
than two decades in professional practice they have never come across evidence of a similar

meeting, °

The Respondent notes that none of the SAT officials who attended such meetings were members
of the Auditing Teams, and further states that two of those officials were involved in corruption
scandals.'®

Tn the Respondent’s submission, this event was regarded as a sign to determine the commission

of a tax crime in the Criminal Complaint against the Distributors (see IIIF.1 below).'*!

Mr. Garcia, who was Chief Executive Officer of IC Power from 2011 until 2017, testifies that he
learned about Actis’ intention to sell the Distributors in the first half of 2015." Being aware that
Energuate held a concession contract until 2048, Mr. Garcia asked Citigroup Globat Markets, Inc.
(Citi), which was acting as Actis’ financial advisor, to include IC Power in the bidding

process. '* As part of the process, IC Power initiated due diligence and valuation studies.'©

1. Due Diligence

In order to conduct its due diligence, IC Power set up 2 team composed of |2 internal members,
assisted by a team of 4 external executives, including the former CEO of Chilectra and Ampla,
and Mr. Horacio Albin, former CFO of Energuate (“DD Team”).'®

The DD Team was advised in relation to tax and legal due diligence by a Guatemalan law firm

{Garcia & Bodan, later known as Asensio, Barrios, Flores, Andradre & Asociados, and currently

known as Sfera Legal),'*’ and with regard te financial and accounting due diligence by

One of the tax matters that has our important attention are the two “Reverse Mergers”
operated [...] Under Guatemala law, all reverse mergers generate a lot of attention within the
tanks of SAT. We have information that SAT has acted very drastically in other reverse
merger cases, even arguing that the structure was implemented as a mechanism to defraud
the Guatemala tax system. In the present case, we were not able to determine if the large tax
adjustments referred...above originates as consequence of the reverse merger. The
Consuttation Procedure referred...above is definitely related to the reverse merger and sets
the record straight regarding two aspects of that merger: the deduction of interest for the debt
incurred by the parent, and the amortization and calculation of the “goodwill” value of the
fiegotiation, However, many other elements of the merger may also come up in the form of
tax adjustments and these will always be against DEORSA and DEOCSA as the surviving
entities. We did not identify any specific claims, and can only infer that these two companies

are not entirely isolated from future claims derived from the reverse merger.

The Client should request specific information regarding the tax claim and material adverse
effects on the situations of those claims... We believe that the tax information available is
very poor. An in depth assessment of a tax case can only be done contrasting SAT’s
arguments with the corresponding defense, including an analysis of the evidence presented

at both administrative and court levels.

97. In their final version of due ditigence report dated 22 October 2015 (“Final version of DD

Report”), Garcia & Bodan advised as follows:

The aspect that relates to the “reverse merger” should also be commented... The effect of this
merger also produces a goodwill that must be amortized. Subsequent to the merger a
consultation procedure was filed as explained above. SAT responded favourably to both
questions leaving no doubt as to the deductibility of the interests, and the amortization of the
goodwill. After SAT’s response was delivered, we found no further tax adjustments
subsequent to SAT’s nullification of the original 2014 tax notices. We're almost sure that
SAT’s responses clarified the issue to the point that no further adjustments were merited,

Regarding some Tax inquiries sent, the Company confirmed that as a result of the Consulta
made to the SAT, the Income Tax Declarations for the fiscal years 2011, 2012, 2013 and
2014 were rectified and the corresponding taxes were paid; however, no documents were

presented for our review to verify this affirmation."

The Parties diverge as to the extent and thoroughness of the due diligence process.

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant submits that its due diligence was extensive and thorough, including in relation to

tax issues:'7 it lasted from May 2015 until January 2016,"” and “at all times” the DD Team

engaged Garcia & Bodan and put forward “probing” questions to obtain a full understanding of

the Binding Tax Opinions.'® In particular, the Claimant denies the Respondent’s allegation that
the DD Team sought to have any risks underestimated.'”!

The DD Team conducted its own review with regard to the Binding Tax Opinions and related

documents. '”

According to the Claimant, the in-house advisors who developed the tax due
diligence were Mr. Daniel Urbina {IC Power’s General Counsel), Mr. Marco Cardenas (former
tax audit manager at EY) and Ms. Angela Grossheim (former lawyer with the Ministry of

Economy and Finance of Peru).'”

Mr. Albin, former CFO of the Distributors, was one of the Claimant’s external advisors during
the due diligence.'”? According to Mr. Albin, the DD Team took into consideration tax issues

when valuing the Distributors: they concluded that the Binding Tax Opinions allowed the

Distributors to deduct interest payments and to amortize goodwill.’

According to the Claimant, the DD Team identified no areas of significant concern.'”
Specifically, the DD ‘Team “considered the deductions a non-issue because of the Binding Tax
Opinions”.'® In Mr. Albin’s words:

Had the due diligence and valuation team had any doubts that the deductions were allowable,
we would have brought it to the attention of the IC Power Board. We did not because we had
no concerns regarding the deductibility of the interest and goodwill amortization on the loans,
given the existence of the Binding Tax Opinions. '**

The Claimant further avers that the Binding Tax Opinions and the SAT Audit documents were
reviewed by Garcia & Bodan, which prepared a specific memorandum on the matter." The
Claimant acknowledges that Garcia & Bodan’s initial advice was unclear in this regard, thus
prompting a request for clarification. In the Final version of DD Report (which was submitted
to the Board of IC Power) Garcia & Bodén advised that the Binding Tax Opinions confirmed the
deductibility of the Tax Deductions.!**

According to the Claimant, Garcia & Bodan’s advice was confirmed by PwC, which was engaged
to assist in the analysis (including tax implications) of potential structures for the Claimant’s

acquisition of the Distributors. '5

The Claimant also submits that Actis confirmed that the Binding Tax Opinions settled the matter
and that “(t]he amount on the books today is vetted by SAT.”!86

As to AIG, which provided insurance coverage for representations and warranties in the SPAs,
the Claimant notes that it conducted its own due diligence as part of the process to enter into the

filling similar tax consultations with the tax authorities to confirm deductibility. However, according to the

The Respondent's Position

According to the Respondent, at the time of acquiring the Distributors, the Claimant knew, or at
least had reason to know, that there were irregularities in the Tax Deductions." This was
evidenced, in the Respondent’s view, by (i) the Audit Report issued by the Taxation Division of
SAT, concluding that the Tax Deductions were not allowable;'” (ii) the Binding Tax Opinions,
which stated that the deduction of any cost or expense was contingent upon it being duly
documented and being indispensable for generating taxable income in Guatemala; and (ii) the
SAT Rectification Payments Minutes and the existence of various corruption scandals within the
SA'T, which were indications that “raised doubts about the way the Distributors’ file had been
‘tesolved’”.'”

Thus, the Respondent is of the view that the Claimant decided to acquire an asset with “an obvious
contingency (i.e., signs of the commission of a tax crime) arising from the undue conduct of its
former owner”.**°

The Respondent further contends that the Claimant did not conduct sufficient due diligence,” or
was at least negligent in conducting it.” In this respect, the Respondent considers that the
Financial Statement Review and Energuate Business Plan Report produced by the DD Team
cannot be regarded as “a proper due diligence”, since (i) the members of such team were
executives with experience on electric power distribution and not experts on tax matters; (ii) the

analysis of tax aspects was very brief and did not cover all aspects which should have been

considered as part of a tax due diligence process; and (iii) the factual description “is plagued

by inconsistencies and red flags”.”°*

Similarly, the Respondent considers that the memorandum prepared by the DD Team for the
Board of Directors of IC Power “deliberately omitted the tax risks”.°®* In this regard, Mr. Garcfa-
Burgos and Mr. Albin acknowledge that tax risks was not included for consideration by the Board
of Directors because the team “had no concerns regarding the deductibility of the interest and
goodwill amortization on the loans, given the existence of the Binding Tax Opinions,””

With respect to the report prepared by PwC, the Respondent notes that it was prepared “in two
days, based on the review of a scant number of documents and without access to company
management.”*°?_ In any event, the Respondent notes, PwC recommended performing “tax due
diligence to identify and quantify any known or unknown potential tax exposures you may be

assuming should you proceed with this transaction.”?°*

Finally, the Respondent argues that the DD Team ignored the warnings from Garcia & Bodan
concerning “red flags” in relation to the extremely short timeframe within which the Binding Tax
Opinions were issued and their recommendation to conduct an “enhanced scrutiny”.2!°

Furthermore, according to the Respondent, every time that Garcia & Bodan attempted to discuss
the risks inherent to the Tax Deductions, “the DD Team sought to have said risks underestimated,

warning in order to rapidly complete the operation”.?”?

The Respondent notes that, in response to the First version of DD Report, Ms, Roxana Guzmdn
sent an e-mail to other members of the DD team in which she proposed to examine why the
reverse triangular merger would be contingent.”!* Later, she sent another message enclosing a
version with comments of the First version of DD Report where she suggested, in retation to the
Tax Deductions, to “ask for the information to draw our own tax conclusions: include rep in the

was any representation included in the share purchase agreement which would allow the Claimant

to claim against Actis if the Tax Deductions were not allowable.?!°

matter, Il do it.”!8 Garcia & Bodan, however, continued to stress that complementary

information in relation to the tax adjustments was necessary.7!?

On the same day, Mr. Urbina put some questions to Garcia & Bodan also concerning FCPA
issues.”° In response, they did not develop a legal analysis, but instead provided some comments
“with a certain logic of an inspector” and suggested to “address the point with the lawyers with

mai

whom they ha[d] a goed relationship” in order to dispel any doubts.’ Mr. Urbina expressed his

concern that addressing those points would “generate more concerns than [they] should.”

The Respondent notes that, in any event, the final version of the FCPA report continued to
recommend “to submit the tax ‘consultation procedures’ filed in February of this year to an
enhanced scrutiny”.?* Hence, the Respondent concludes that it is not true that the Tax Deductions
were a “non-issue”.”4

Finally, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant has not provided evidence to establish that AIG

and its advisors reached that same conclusion.”

On [2 February 2016, the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (“CICIG”)
unveiled a corruption case known as “Aceros de Guatemala”.** According to the Respondent,
this case is “especially relevant” because three of the officials implicated in such case made
crucial decisions with regard to the Distributors’ case. The Claimant insists that the Respondent
has not established the commission of any wrongdoing by those or other officials in relation with
the Distributors’ files.””,

2. Change of Leadership in SAT

In March 2016, President Morales appointed Mr. Juan Francisco Solérzano Foppa as the new
head of the SAT.* At his swearing-in, President Morales asserted that an “effort to convert the
SAT into an efficient and effective institution capable of increasing taxes in a sustained, honest

and transparent manner” was necessary.?°°

Within one month from the designation of the new Superintendent, the SAT opened investigations

in relation to 161 companies mentioned in the so-called Panama Papers.”

as “aggressive”, and notes that they were frequently reported by the Guatemalan press.*“! The

Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s criticisms of Mr. Solérzano Foppa, noting that different

press outlets praised his work.”¥?

3. Revision of the Distributors’ Tax Declarations

On 27 Aprit 2016, Mr. Sclérzano Foppa sent a memorandum to SAT employees inviting “the

auditors and other professionals connected to oversight processes to indicate those files that were
,
resolved at the time, to the detriment of the Tax Administration”.2*?

According to the testimony of Mr. David Mufioz, in June 2016, in response to Mr. Solérzano
Foppa’s request, Mr. Luis Argelio Villatoro Cifuentes, Head of the Verifications Department and
Mr. Mufioz’s supervisor, allocated around 483 files for revision to a group of employees.™4
Mr. Mufioz was assigned the revision of files No. 2012-21-01-44-0001276 and 2012-21-01-44-
0001277, concerning the Distributors’ Tax Audit.24*

According to Mr. Mufioz, in light of the potential tax underpayment that could be established
from the SAT Hearings Notifications, he arranged various meetings with members of the Auditing,
Teams and with his supervisor.” He testifies that during such meetings they “noted various acts

that constituted signs of commission of the crime of tax fraud described in Article 358 A of the

Guatemalan Criminal Code”.47

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent avers that the Panama Papers scandal led authorities worldwide to conduct
investigations.“*_In the context of corruption scandals within the SAT, Mr. Solérzano Foppa
took measures to coordinate the revision of certain large taxpayers’ files who could have been

granted illegal benefits by SAT employees.”°

According to the Respondent, the SAT’s approach to report the possible commission of tax fraud
was “duly grounded in fact and in law”.2° Within such process, the SAT considered that the

Distributors’ files contained signs of a possible tax fraud.”*!

According to Mr. Mujioz, the officials in charge of the review of the Distributors’ files considered
several indications of tax fraud, inciuding certain irregularities in relation to the Rectification
Payments, such as the fact that they were made unbeknownst to the Auditing Teams, or the

absence of technical and accounting information to assess their correctness.**

Similarly,
Mr. Mufioz alleges that the SAT Rectification Payments Minutes and the meetings recorded
therein “are completely irregular”.

Mr. Muftoz also testifies that certain decisions from the Criminal Affairs Department
(Departamento de Auntos Penales de la Intendencia de Asuntos Juridicos) aiso raised suspicion,
since they indicated that “for the moment, it is impossible to begin criminal prosecution [against
the Distributors], since the causal link regulated in Article 10 of the Criminal Code does not

follow”. In this regard, he states that the Criminal A ffairs Department did not have jurisdiction

to issue such decision: according to Resolution No. 467-2007, the Verifications Department
(Departamento de Verificaciones) was the competent unit to assess whether there was a legal
basis for filing criminal charges insofar as the Distributors’ files qualified as “high-impact
cases”. *

Moreover, the Respondent argues that the brief analysis set out by the Criminal Affairs
Department in its decisions lacked merit: under Guatemalan law, the SAT was only required to
assess whether there were sufficient indications to file a criminal complaint, and did not need to
establish the existence of a causal link as a constituent element of a criminal charge. Such

analysis would correspond to the criminal judge in the context of a criminal proceeding.”

The Respondent also notes that the decisions were approved by the former Legal Affairs Bureau
Chief, who was facing a criminal trial for having influenced the modification of various audit

reports in a publicly known corruption scandal. **

According to the Respondent, it was as a result of the above factors, and in accordance with the

The Claimant's Position

According to the Claimant, under its new leadership, the SAT adopted a new approach to tax
collection which “disregarded applicable law, precedents and due process”.”°

The Claimant contends that the SAT started to disregard the appropriate administrative
proceedings in favour of criminal proceedings, “using the latter as a shortcut to achieve its

goals”.”*' In the Claimant’s submission, such strategy was known in Guatemala as “tax

terrorism”.@?

Mr. Mufioz’s testimony is characterized by the Claimant as a “cursory review” of the Distributors’
audit file: and notes that it has produced no official documentation to evidence that proper
administrative proceedings were followed leading up to the Criminal Complaint.”

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s criticisms regarding the determinations made by the
Criminal Affairs Department of the Legal Affairs Bureau: (i) such department was competent to
analyse the matter according to the regulations applicable at the time: (4i) the Head of the Legal
Affairs Bureau, even if allegedly involved in an unrelated corruption scandal, did nothing but
approve the reports that had been prepared by another official, and, in any event, the Respondent
has not provided evidence of any wrongdoing in relation with the reports at stake in this case;”*
and (iii) the causal link is one of the elements of tax fraud and its analysis was necessary to avoid

the criminalization of trivial tax matters.”

CRIMINAL PROCEEDING AND FURTHER TAX AUDIT AGAINST THE DISTRIBUTORS

1. SAT’s Criminal Complaint

On 13 July 2016, the SAT filed a criminal complaint for tax fraud against the Distributors (the
“Criminal Complaint”), which was admitted on 22 July 2016 by the Fifth Criminal, Narcotics,
and Environmental Crimes Trial Court of the Department of Guatemala (the “Criminal Court”),
resulting in a criminal proceeding currently underway in Guatemala (the “Criminal
Proceeding”).
The Criminal Complaint accused the Distributors of tax fraud in relation to the Tax Deductions
for tax years 2011 and 2012.* The crime of tax fraud is regulated in Article 358 A of the
Guatemalan Criminal Code which provides that such crime is committed by:

the person who, through misrepresentation, cover-up, manipulation, trickery, or any other

type of deception, leads the Tax Administration to error in the determination or payment of

tax obligations, such that it results in detriment to or underpayment in tax collection, commits

the crime of tax fraud”25°
‘The Parties are in disagreement as to whether the submission of the Criminal Complaint by the

SAT was carried out in d with the applicable requi under G lan law.

 

The Claimant's Position

Before submitting a criminal complaint, the Claimant states, the SAT must exhaust administrative
proceedings in order to establish whether there is evidence of a violation of the Tax Code,

determine the amount of any lability, and afford due process to the taxpayer.”” This obligation

stems from Article 103 of the Tax Code”! and such legal requirement was established, at least

partially, to protect the rights of tax payers.””

Thus, in failing to exhaust administrative proceedings, the Criminal Complaint was, in the
Claimant’s view, “legally deficient”.”? This is further underscored by certain SAT Internal
Reports noting that the Department of Legal Affairs declined to recommend the initiation of

criminal proceedings against the Distributors on several occasions.”

The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, the SAT was correct in concluding that there were sufficient
indications to warrant the submission of the Criminal Complaint,?”> and notes that the submission
of the Criminal Complaint was approved by the Legal Affairs Bureau Chief, who participated as

assistant in the complaint, together with the entire Verifications Department.”

The Respondent avers that a criminal compiaint does not need “to prove categorically all the
elements of the crime, since this job is within the purview of the Prosecutor's Office and not within

that of the SAT”.2”” In any event, the Respondent is of the view that the Criminal Complaint does

establish the tax underpayment by the Distributors, which had been analysed in detail by the

Auditing Teams.”

Furthermore, the Criminal Complaint met the requirements set forth under Guatemalan law,
which does not require the prior exhaustion of an administrative or legal procedure.2” On the
contrary, the Respondent submits that Guatemalan law requires officials to suspend an
administrative procedure and file a criminal complaint whenever they find evidence of a crime’s
commission.” The Respondent refers in this regard to the prohibition of non bis in idem
contained in Article 90 of the Tax Code,” and to jurisprudence from the Constitutional Court of
Guatemaia which has held that:

»..this regulation does not require the administrative procedure before the Superintendence

of Tax Administration to be exhausted before the criminal complaint is filed. In light of the

above, no violation of the rights to defense and due process are found in this case, since,

specifically, it is in protection of these rights that the administrative authority abstains from

suling in an administrative context so that, given the alleged commission of criminal acts, the

matter is examined before the competent courts of the criminal division, and thus avoiding
duplication of sanctions for the same action, in accordance with Article 90 of the Tax Code.?*

 

Similarly, the Respondent argues that it was not necessary for the SAT to obtain a decision from
a civil judge declaring that certain acts in the 2011 Transaction had been a misrepresentation:
misrepresentation is merely one of the several acts through which tax fraud may be committed,
and the Criminal Complaint was not circumscribed to simulation, as such specific determination

would correspond te the judge.”* In any event, the Constitutional Court of Guatemala has

2. Criminal Proceedings and Second Tax Audit

(a) Provisional Measures: Preventive Seizure of Bank Accounts

On 29 July 2016, the Criminal Court held an ex parte hearing concerning precautionary measures
in the Criminal Proceeding.”** Inter alia, the Criminal Court ordered a preventive seizure of bank
accounts against the Distributors for the full amounts that were alleged to be owed for taxes
corresponding to the fiscal years 2011 and 2012.”* The Parties disagree as to the legality of the

preventive seizures.

The Claimant's Position

According to Mr. Albin, the Distributors met regularly with the SAT between 27 July 2016 and
10 August 2016 in attempts to bring an end to the Criminal Proceeding.”” However, the SAT
did not act in good faith.’** In particular, Mr. Albin testifies that, in a meeting held on 28 July
2016, the Distributors’ lawyers requested that the SAT refrain from filing a freezing order request
against the Distributors’ bank accounts; the SAT representatives agreed, and indicated to the
Distributors that they did not need to attend the hearing scheduled for the following day.”*”

However, the Distributors later learned that, on 29 July 2016, the Criminal Court had issued

orders—at the Government’s request and without their presence—freezing the Distributors’ bank

accounts for the full amounts that the SAT alleged were owed for taxes corresponding to 2011
and 2012.7

The Claimant alleges that the freezing orders were not in compliance with Guatemalan law. First,
the SAT should have proven the existence of a “risk” in order to obtain preliminary measures.””!
Second, the SAT’s request for provisional measures did not meet the requirements contained in
Article 530 of the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure, as laid out in the jurisprudence of
the Constitutional Court of Guatemala.?? In particular, the Claimant contends that: (i) the
provisional measures were unnecessary because the Distributors had always cooperated with
SAT, including by voluntarily making Rectification Payments; (ji) the provisional measures were
legally defective because the SAT did not offer any evidence of tax fraud nor any risk to the
Distributors’ funds; and (iii) the Criminal Complaint concerned conduct from the previous
management, while there was no evidence that the current management of the Distributors posed

“an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the SAT or the investigation”.

Thus, in the Claimant’s submission, the provisional measures awarded by the Criminal Court (the

 

freezing of bank accounts and later the appointment of a receiver, as set out in Section III.F.2(d)

below) were arbitrary and unsupported under the circumstances.”

Furthermore, the Claimant criticizes that the freezing of bank accounts was “overbroad” because
it was not limited to the amounts at issue. Rather, orders were issued on every bank account held

by the Distributors (“far exceeding the amounts of the alleged tax deficiencies”) and the orders

C-180); Communications from the Criminal Court to various banks regarding Deocsa and Deorsa bank

contention that the Criminal Court did not order “freezing orders” but “seizures on the bank accounts for
specific amounts” is merely a semantic issue (see Claimant’s Statement of Reply and Response to
Jurisdictional Objections, para. 112),

not only blocked withdrawal of funds but also deposits into the accounts, which prevented the

Distributors’ clients from making any payments and “effectively blocked” any business.”*

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent clarifies that, in the Criminat Complaint, it was the SAT that requested that a

hearing be held to decide on the adoption of precautionary measures;?**

noting that the
Constitutional Court of Guatemala has confirmed the SAT’s authority to request precautionary
measures in criminal proceedings.” However, at the hearing, it was the Public Prosecutor’s
office (as opposed to the SAT) who—as is standard practice—requested the precautionary seizure

of the amounts owed.”

The R dent submits that i y may be req under Gi law
without the initial participation of the respondent, a practice that seeks to avoid attempts to thwart
such measures.” Once ordered, the affected party may challenge their appropriateness and
duration through reconsideration and nullity chalienges. If rejected, an appeal may be filed and,
in exceptional circumstances, relief may also be sought before the Constitutional Court.°

Reduction or replacement by sufficient assets or guarantees may be also requested.°*"

The Respondent denies the Claimant’s allegation that certain SAT officials instructed the
Distributors’ lawyers not fo attend the hearing at which the precautionary measures were
discussed and granted.*? The Respondent notes that, in any event, the question is irrelevant, as

it was an ex parte hearing.*?

The Respondent further affirms that the Criminal Court did not grant “freezing orders” as
suggested by the Claimant, but seizures on bank accounts for specific amounts. In the
Respondent's view, this is not merely a “semantic distinction” as argued by the Claimant:*" the
order did not impede the deposit of funds into the Distributors’ bank accounts,” and the Claimant
has faited to produce evidence of any such hurdle.*”’ According to the Respondent, any freezing
of the bank account for deposits must have been unrelated to the freezing orders, seeing that the

terms of the seizure order and notices are clear.*°*

The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's assertions that the preventive seizures violated
Article 170 of the Tax Code and Article 530 of the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure: the
Public Prosecutor requested such measures in order to protect the interests of the tax authority

and prevent the risk that the Distributors could not comply with a possible conviction.°%

Likewise, according to the Respondent, the seizures were not excessive: they were ordered for
the exact amount claimed in the Criminal Complaint.*"” The Respondent notes that, for reasons

of bank secrecy, the Criminal Court, the Public Prosecutor and the SAT were not privy to which

Distributors’ agreement to pay to the SAT the full amounts allegedly owed pursuant to the

Criminai Complaint, as well as rectification payments for fiscal years 2013 to 2015.5

The Respondent denies that the Distributors conveyed an intention to pay the amounts claimed in
the Criminal Complaint to the SAT, including interest and fines.*”° In such circumstances and on
account of the essential nature of the electricity services provided by the Distributors, the SAT,
the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Attorney General’s Office jointly requested the Criminal
Court to hold an earlier hearing to discuss the lifting of the preventive seizures: as a result, the

hearing was rescheduled for 9 August 2016.7!

On 8 August 2016, Energuate’s senior management decided to pay the amounts requested by SAT
to avoid risking the Distributors’ operational viability.” According to Mr. Doppett’s testimony,
he agreed with Mr. Garcia that, if the SAT were to file a claim with regard to years 2013 to 2015,

the claim would include penalties in an amount that the Distributors would not be able to pay.”

On 9 August 2016 prior to the Hearing, the Distributors’ lawyers held a meeting with SAT
officials, the Public Prosecution and the Attorney General’s Office.°™

According to the Claimant, the Distributors’ lawyers informed the public officials that the
Distributors would pay the alleged tax deficiencies for tax years 2011 and 2012, as well as alleged
tax deficiencies for tax years 2014 and 2015 “given the risk of a new criminal complaint” in
relation to the tax year 2015, and would also pay the alleged tax deficiency for year 2013 within

10 days from the Court’s decision to lift the preventive seizures.*> They noted that such payments

“would not be voluntary, would be made in protest, would not be an admission of liability, and
would be subject to a full reservation of the Distributors’ rights.”°?* According to the Claimant,
the Distributors’ payments under protest to the SAT amounted to a total of US$ 75 million (the

“Payments under Protest”).°””

The Respondent alleges that the 9 August meeting was devoted to discussing the conditions under
which the lifting of the precautionary measures would be requested. It asserts that the public
officials agreed net to oppose such request if payment of the amounts owed for tax years 2011
and 2012, plus interest and fines, was guaranteed.*** The Respondent denies that the discussions
regarding the lifting of the precautionary measures encompassed payments in relation to tax years
2013 to 2015. According to Mr. Mufioz, it was the Distributors who proposed to make such
payments, and the SAT never threatened to file another criminal claim or condition the lifting of

the precautionary measures upon such payments.**

At the hearing, the SAT informed the judge that the Distributors would make payments for tax
years 201f to 2015 with regard to the years covered in the Criminal Complaint, and would also
pay the alleged deficiencies, fallowed by a payment of interest and penalties within 60 days.*!

to prevent further exposure”. Furthermore, the Claimant argues that the Criminal Proceeding undermined
the Claimant’s ability to invest in the Distributors as planned under the business plan as well as the
Distributors’ reputation and diverted attention from management {see Claimant’s Statement of Claim,

On 27 October 2016, the Distributors’ lawyer requested the Criminal Court to schedule a hearing
for the discussion and review of the SAT’s calculation of interest and fines. On the same date,
the Criminal Court scheduled the hearing for 29 December 2016.

{d) Provisional Measures: Designation of Receivers

On 12 December 2016, there was an ex parte hearing attended by the SAT, the Public Prosecutor’s
Office and the Attorney General Office in which the SAT requested, inter alia, the appointment
of a receiver for the Distributors.” The judge granted the request to appoint receivers over the
Distributors and to issue subpoenas to certain individuals, including Mr. Albin2* The judge,
however, denied the request to inspect, register and obtain financial documents from the

Distributors’ offices.*"*

According to the Respondent, the SAT requested the appointment of receivers due to the
Distributors’ failure to pay interest and fines as had been agreed in the previous hearing.’
Mr. Mufioz testifies that such measure was requested in lieu of preventive seizures due to its lesser

impact, as it protects the normal course of business of the companies.>°!

The Claimant considers the request for the appointment of receivers as “further proof that the
SAT would punish any attempt to ‘challenge’ the ‘appropriateness’ of the preliminary
measures”.**? According to Mr. Albin, the Distributors feared that the appointment of receivers
“could destroy the Distributors’ operations” and thus “felt compelled” to pay the full amount for

interest and penalties for years 201} and 2012 as calculated by SAT.*°

On 13 December 2016, the Distributors conveyed to the SAT their intention to pay the full amount
for interest and penalties corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 as calculated by SAT in light of

the decision to intervene in the Distributors in order to guarantee such payment.*** Such payments

were made under protest.°>>

On 14 December 2016, the Distributors requested the Criminal Court to vacate the order to
appoint a receiver, noting that they had paid the amounts allegedly due as fines and interest for
years 201! and 2012 under protest.>**

On the same date, the Criminal Court decided to vacate the intervention order as well as to lift the

liens imposed over certain vehicles from the Distributors.°°”

On 4 November 2019, the Distributors filed another motion before the Criminal Court seeking
the dismissal of the Criminal Complaint for lack of causal relation and lack of elements of the

crime (“falta de elementos de tipicidad’)*”

The Respondent's Position on the Preliminary Motions

The Respondent contends that the defendants in the Criminal Proceeding have filed many
preliminary motions with dilatory purposes.°”!

In particular, the Respondent asserts that the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and the
motion of prejudiciaiity are similar in content to the Claimant’s arguments in this arbitration 3”
Both preliminary motions were dismissed in first instance and are pending resolution before

Guatemalan higher courts.?”

The Claimant's Position on the Preliminary Motions

The Claimant is critical of the Respondent’s characterization of the preliminary motions filed by
the Distributors, arguing that the Distributors, in filing such, are availing themselves of their right
of defense against the SAT’s allegations.**

Moreover, the Claimant denies that it or the Distributors would have any incentive in delaying
the Criminal Proceeding, noting that, while the proceeding is still pending, the Respondent will

remain in possession of the full amount in dispute, which was paid under protest.”

(f) Audit in relation to Rectification Payments and Calculation of Amounts
Allegedly Due

On 4 December 2018, the Criminal Court ordered the SAT to develop new audits in relation to
316

the Rectification Payments.
On 29 January 2018, an independent expert appointed by the Criminal Court submitted an opinion
on certain matters as requested by the Criminal Court.””? The Claimant underscores the
independent expert’s opinion that the Binding Tax Opinions complied with the legal
tequirements.*”* The Respondent replies that the independent expert only assessed whether the
requirements to issue a binding opinion were complied with and the necessary formal elements
were included. However, he did not align himself with the Claimant’s interpretation of the

opinions.”

On 27 February 2019, the SAT issued reports in response to the Criminal Court’s order, finding
that “the tax paid as a result of the rectifications, which were not considered in the submitted
criminal complaint, so the taxpayer can request its compensation or devolution to the SAT through
the corresponding administrative procedure”.**°

On 29 May 2019, a hearing was held before the Criminal Court to present the results of the new
tax audit. The judge granted the Distributors’ request to have the amount of interest and fines
determined and ordered the SAT to apply and compensate the amounts received on 19 February
2015, 10 August 2016 and 13 December 2016 through an administrative resotution.**!

On 13 January 2020, the Distributors filed an administrative appeal (“recurso de revocatoria”)
before the SAT in relation to the resolutions dated 26 December 2019.”

On 15 January 2020, the Criminal Court granted the Distributors’ request and issued an order
requiring the SAT to compensate said amounts and to issue a new resolution recalculating the
amounts due within 72 hours.*° According to the Claimant, the SAT is yet to comply with this

order."

(g) Current Status of the Criminal Proceeding

The Criminal Proceeding is still underway before Guatemalan criminal courts. °°

According to the Respondent, the Criminal Proceeding is still in its investigative phase and so far
there has been no formal indictment issued by the Public Prosecutor’s Office against the

Distributors.°°*

The Respondent notes that the Payments under Protest could be restored if the Distributors are
acquitted in the Criminal Proceeding.** The Respondent refers in this regard to the Distributors’
financial statements for years 2016 and 2017, which note that “Energuate’s administration
believes that, based on the opinion of its tax and legal experts, there is a greater than 50%

probability of recovering these payments as a result of the final resolution of this claim and other

appeals that will be filed by Energuate and the Company”.***

The Claimant is critical of the fact that the Criminal Proceeding has been ongoing for four years
now “with no end in sight”. According to Mr. Donado, as the Criminal Proceeding is still in a
preliminary stage, it may still take ten or more years until a final decision is taken.” He further

considers that there is a real risk that the Payments under Protest may not be refunded.*

DISTRIBUTORS’ REQUEST FOR BINDING TAX OPINIONS REGARDING DEBT REFINANCING

On 17 October 2016, the Distributors submitted to the SAT a request to obtain a binding opinion
pursuant to Article 102 of the Tax Code regarding the entitlement to deduct interest arising from
the refinanced debt (the “Consultation Requests”). In the Consultation Requests, the
Distributors submitted the following specific questions to the SAT:

1. Is it considered to be exempt from the 10% retention in relation to ISR [income tax] the

payment or accreditation over account of interests that [DEOCSA / DEORSA, respectively]
will make in favour of Santander as a result of the financing structure described above?

2, Is it considered as a deductible expense in relation to ISR [income tax] the interests paid
abroad in accordance with the financing structure described above in the section
“Background)??°?

 

On 21D 2016, the Distri ibmitted a modification submission with regard to their
Consultation Requests, now stating that the financing entity would be Credit Suisse (the
“Modified Consultation Requests”).*°

On 6 December 2016, the SAT issued non-binding opinions in response to the Distributors’
Modified Consultation Requests (the “Non-Binding Tax Opinions”).*"'

The Non-Binding Tax Opinions indicated that the Unit of Tax Consultations (“Unidad de
Consultas Tributarias y Aduaneras del Departamento de Consultas de la Intendencia de Asuntos
Juridicos”) had sent the (Modified) Consultation Requests to the Unit of Legal Orientation
(“Unidad de Orientacién Legal y Derechos del Contribuyente del Departamento de Consultas de

was not competent fo entertain the request, given that it was not 2 specific tax consultation,

as from the reading of the request it flows that it is not a binding consultation within the terms

referred to in Article £02 of the Tax Code, insofar as the requesting party refers to its interest

in acquiring debt to finance its operations with the purpose of continuing its current business

in electric energy distribution in Guatemala and for the financing structure [DEOCSA /

DEORSA, respectively], has considered Banco Santander, resident abroad, from the above it

was decided that it had to be addressed as a request for Legal Orientation, pursuant to Articles

1 and 6 of Resolution No SAT-S-1706-2012, which modified Resolution No. 467-2007, both

from the Superintendent of Tax Administration.“
The Distributors refinanced their debt in May 2017 and, according to Mr. Albin, did not claim
interest deductions as a result of the SAT’s refusal to provide binding tax opinions on the matter
and its recent treatment of the Distributors.“

CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES

letter to the President of Guatemala, with copies provided to the Ministers of Economy, Public

THE CLAIM AGREEMENT AND SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT

Before the Sale was closed, on 28 December 2017, Nautilus Inkia Holdings LLC, DEOCSA,
DEORSA, IC Power Distribution Hoidings, Pte. Ltd, and IC Power entered into an agreement
whereby IC Power would “continue to retain the right to pursue the Investment Treaty Claims
against Guatemala and to retain any proceeds thereof” (the “Claim Agreement” or “Letter

Agreement”)."*° Pursuant to the Letter Agreement:

Buyer, DEOCSA and DEORSA agree not to, and Buyer agrees to cause no Acquired
Company or Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates to, pursue any investment treaty claim in
connection with the SAT Criminal Complaint or the Guatemalan Tax Payment or any matter
directly related to the SAT Criminal Complaint or the Guatemalan Tax Payment.?!

On 19 December 2019, IC Power and ISQ entered into a supplemental agreement whereby they
clarified their original intention in entering the Claim Agreement (the “Supplemental

Agreement”). The Supp!emental Agreement provides, in relevant part, as follows:

1. Allocation of Economic Benefits. The Parties hereby confirm and document their original
intention that ICPAD shall retain the economic benefit of any refund or repayment of the
Guatemalan Tax Payment (as such definition is amended herein) and receive a payment with
respect to any deductions for interest expense and amortization of goodwill for the years 2018
through the end of 2027 to which DEOCSA and DEORSA might be entitled to in connection
with the SA'T Criminal Complaint.

2. Pursuit of Economic Benefits. The Parties further confirm and document their original
intention that, in furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer 1, DEORSA and DEOCSA shall not
and Buyer | agrees to cause each Acquired Company, Subsidiary and any of their Affiliates
not to, initiate, file, institute, or proceed upon any Action to pursue, or otherwise claim, any
SAT Tax Recovery to the extent that such amounts are being pursued or have been received
by Seller 2 or any of its Affiliates, including ICPAD, pursuant to the Investment Treaty
Claims.“

According to the Respondent, there is a risk that Guatemala will have to face several claims

regarding the same facts as a consequence of the Sale of the Distributors, and there is also a risk

THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION

1. The Date on which the Investment Must be Held
(a) The Parties’ Arguments

The Respondent's Position

Fhe Respondent submits that, as the Claimant did not have an existing investment in Guatemala
when it filed its Notice of Arbitration on 20 February 2018, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to
decide this matter. In the Respondent’s view, the Claimant’s investment only existed until
December 2017, “when it transferred its ownership in the Distributors to a third party.“ The
Respondent cites the Lockerbie case for the proposition that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is
determined from “the time that the act instituting proceedings was filed.“ Recalling
Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. v. Slovak Republic, the Respondent contends that “the
determination whether a party has standing in an international judicial forum . . . is made by
reference to the date on which such proceedings are deemed to have been instituted.”**° The
Respondent notes that Article 8 of the Treaty—which relates to settlement of disputes arising
pursuant to the Treaty—is to resolve “any dispute related to an investment”*** between parties.“*”
The Respondent argues that as the Claimant did not have the necessary “investment” at the

relevant time, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction under the Treaty.

For the Respondent, the Claimant’s earlier ownership of the Distributors is “irrelevant”. The
Respondent cites David R. Aven, et al. v. Republic of Costa Rica for the principle that “an investor
who disposes of ownership of the investment in question before arbitral proceedings should not
be eligible to seek the Treaty’s protection, unless special circumstances are present.”* The

Respondent argues that none of the special circumstances foreseen in David R. Aven, et al. v.

Republic of Costa Rica—such as the loss of the investment due to third-party action—are present
here.“ According to the Respondent, “the sale of the Distributors’ shares to ! Squared was a
business decision ... unrelated to the Distributors’ transaction and even less to the criminal
investigation resulting from the SAT’s complaint.” In this respect, the Respondent notes that
the sale of the Claimant’s share in the Distributors in 2017 was part of a much larger sale, and is
hence unrelated to Guatemala’s conduct.**' ‘The Respondent further submits that the Claimant
decided to selt “for market reasons” and that, as it notified the Government of the dispute only
after commencing negotiations for its shares, there can be no suggestion “it had been forced to
sell its assets as a result of the SAT’s conduct.“ As such, the Respondent contends that the
relevant date for the Claimant to have held these investments remains that on which the Notice of

Arbitration was filed.

tn the Respondent’s view, the Claimant’s express retention of claims under the Treaty in its sale
of the Distributors is irrelevant to the question of jurisdiction. The Respondent submits that “[t]his
is a unilateral declaration by Claimant; it is not binding on the state, and it cannot be understood

as a change in the jurisdictional requirements under the treaty between Israel and Guatemala.“

The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s view that the “relevant date to determine the

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s position that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction as a result of
the Claimant having sold its shares in the Distributors.”

According to the Claimant, “the relevant date to assess whether Claimant held qualifying
investments under the Treaty is the date on which the disputed measures were adopted, i.¢., at the
time of the alleged breach." The Claimant notes that there is no dispute that it held an

investment at the time of the alleged breaches.*”?

In any event, however, the Claimant submits that it continued to hold the “right to pursue the
Investment Treaty Claims against Guatemala”, which was expressly reserved in its sale of the
Distributors. Whether viewed as “rights derived from stock, shares . . . and other kinds of interest
interests in legal entities,” stemming from its previous shareholding, or as “claims to money,
goodwill and other assets and any claim having an economic value,” the Claimant submits that

this suffices to demonstrate an investment. *?°

According to the Claimant, “[t]he Treaty does not require that a claimant continue to hold certain
assets in order to bring a claim. The term ‘investment dispute’ does not require continuous
holding of any assets, much less all assets.”“*! The Claimant submits that this accords with the
view in E? Paso v, Argentina that “[t]here is no rule of continuous ownership of the investment"
and that the right to demand compensation for the injury under ICSID or a BIT mechanism
continues to exist unless it was “sold with the investment.” In the Claimant’s view, any
requirement of continuous ownership “would imply that an illegal expropriation, which by
definition deprives the investor of the ownership of its investment prior to the treaty arbitration,

would automatically deprive any tribunal under that treaty of jurisdiction.”***

In the Claimant’s view, the decisions of the International Court of Justice in Lockerbie” and

Arrest Warrant **

are inapposite to the circumstances of the present case. Both cases “concerned
objections that events that postdated the filing of the application to the Court deprived it of
jurisdiction.”"*’ In any case, the Claimant maintains that it still held an investment at the time of

its Notice of Arbitration.“

The Claimant submits that investment arbitration precedents support its view. The Claimant relies
in particular on GEA Group Aktiengeselischaft v. Ukraine," which it considers “analogous to

the present case."

In that case, the Claimant argues, the tribunal declined to introduce a
continuous ownership requirement that it considered to have no foundation in the Treaty, the
ICSID Convention, or the ICSID Rules.**! The Claimant also relies on Daimler v. Argentina and
its holding that “should accord standing to any qualifying investor under the relevant treaty texts
who suffered damages as a result of the allegedly offending governmental measures at the time
that those measures were taken—provided that the investor did not otherwise relinquish its right
to bring an ICSID claim.**

The Claimant distinguishes the Respondent’s reliance on David R. Aven, ef al. v. Republic of
Costa Rica, and the argument that it must show “special circumstances””> to establish the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction while having disposed of its investment. According to the Claimant, this
was “an ICSID case with little relevance to the present dispute." The Claimant further notes

that the claimant in David R. Aven did not expressly retain its rights to the investment claim and

that the definition of investment under the there-applicable DR-CAFTA implies a requirement of

continuous ownership.‘”°

The Claimant submits that “Respondent conflates two unrelated issues: (i) the date on which
jurisdiction must be established by a tribunal under international law, and (ii) whether disposal of
an investment before proceedings commence deprives a tribunal of jurisdiction.”** The general
tule, according to the Claimant, implies only that a Tribunal with jurisdiction as of the notice of
arbitration will not lose it due to subsequent developments; it does not imply a rule of continuous
ownership for investments, “particularly when the investor retains that component of the assets

and the right to bring a claim”."””

 

The Claimant i that the only it relevant to situations where an i was
transferred before arbitration is that “the investor did not otherwise relinquish its right to bring”"*
the treaty claim.” The Claimant submits that it has met this requirement. According to the
Claimant:

JC Power has demonstrated that it held a qualifying investment under the Treaty at all

televant times. IC Power specifically negotiated for, and ultimately retained the right to bring

this Treaty claim in its sale of the Distributors to ISQ. The Treaty specifically defines

“investment” to include “claims to money, goodwill and other assets and any claim having
an economic value.”°°

(b) The Tribunal’s Considerations

Reduced to its essence, the Respondent's objection is that IC Power was required to hold an
investment in Guatemala at the moment it initiated these arbitral proceedings. The Claimant
having voluntarily sold its interest in the Distributors, the Respondent posits that it no longer holds
an investment and the Tribunal must deny jurisdiction. The Claimant both denies that any such
requirement exists, in particular where it has expressly retained from the sale of the Distributors
the right to bring these claims, and submits that it did in fact retain an investment at the time these

proceedings were commenced.

Although contrary to the order in which these issues were argued by the Parties, the Tribunal
considers it opportune to begin its analysis with the Claimant’s alternative argument, namely that
the Claimant did in fact maintain an investment at the time it began this arbitration. The more
complicated legal analysis of the rights of an investor under the Treaty in respect of an investment
it no longer retains may well be avoided if the Claimant maintained a qualifying investment even
after its sale of the Distributors.

As the Tribunal understands the Claimant's argument, it invokes two distinct elements of the
definition of investment within Article | of the Treaty. The Claimant has expressly retained “the
tight to pursue the Investment Treaty Claims against Guatemala and to retain any proceeds

thereof” from its sale of the Distributors.*!

The Claimant considers that this retained right
qualifies as an investment either as a “claims to money, goodwill and other assets and any claim
having an economic value” pursuant to Article 1(1)(a)(3) of the Treaty or as a “right[] derived
from stocks, shares, .. . and other kinds of interests in legal entities” under Article 1(1)(a)(2), with

the shares in question being the Claimant’s former share interest in the Distributors.

In the Tribunal’s view, the difficulty with this argument stems from the chapeau of the definition
of investment within the Treaty and also from the question of where a public international law
claim under the Treaty can be said to be located. The chapeau of Article 1(1) of the Treaty limits
an ii to assets “i din with the legislation of the C ing Party
in whose territory the investment is made.”*” For the Tribunal, this formulation implies that a
qualifying investment must be physically located within the territory of Guatemala or arise as a
matter of Guatemalan law. While the Tribunal could accept that the retention of a Guatemalan
law claim from the sale of the remainder of the Claimant’s investment would constitute an
investment in its own right (as a “claim for money” “implemented in accordance with”
Guatemalan law), this does not hold true for a Treaty claim. Even if directly related to the
Claimant’s investment in the Distributors in Guatemala, a public international law claim under
the Treaty cannot fairly be said to constitute an asset located in Guatemala. And it certainly is
not something implemented in accordance with Guatemalan law. Effectively, the Claimant’s

retention of Treaty claims in its sale of its investment is no different than if it had retained an

intcrest in a foreign (non-Guatemalan) asset owned by the Distributors: the Claimant has retained

a portion of the property rights comprising its investment, but not one tocated in Guatemala.

The Tribunal also agrees with the reasoning of the Tribunal in Axos Capital v. Kosovo that a
contrary interpretation would produce paradoxical results: any investor would create a qualifying
investment through the mere fact of advancing a claim under the treaty.*°? The ‘Tribunal
accordingly concludes that the Claimant’s Treaty claims do not themselves constitute qualitying

investments under Treaty.

Having disposed of the Claimant’s alternative argument, the Tribunal now turns to the question
of whether an investor may bring claims under the Treaty in respect of an investment it has since

sold, ia particular where it has expressly retained the right to do so.

The first point of contention between the Parties with respect to this question is whether the

 

existence of a qualifying i should be as at the ofp dings,
or at some other point in time. To determine the scope of the Parties’ consent in the present

matter, the Tribunal must fook first to the terms of the Treaty itself.

The Tribunal notes that Article 8 of the Treaty limits recourse to arbitration to “[ajny investment
dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party.”*** The same
provision refers in Spanish to “{cJualquier controversia concerniente a una inversin entre un
inversionista de una Parte C y 4a otra Parte Contr: 5S The Treaty provides that
its English, Spanish, and Hebrew texts shall be equally authentic, but that the English text shall
prevail in the event of any differences with respect to interpretation. Here, however, the Tribunal

sees no difference between the English and Spanish formulations.

“Investor” is a defined term and in the case of a legal person includes “a legal entity, including a
corporation, a firm, an association or a partnership: (i) that was incorporated, constituted or

otherwise duly organized under the legislation of the Home Contracting Party.”5°° While the

definition of investor does not itself explicitly require a company to make an investment, the
“Home Contracting Party” is defined as the Contracting Party other than that “in whose territory
the investment is made.”*”’ Effectively, therefore, an investment must have been made for a legal
entity to qualify as an investor under the Treaty. It is a peculiarity of the Treaty that no such
restriction appears to apply to natural persons, however, and it would appear that, on the face of

the Treaty, any citizen of Guatemala or Israel, save for dual nationals, is an “investor”.

The ordinary meaning of an “investment dispute” is a dispute with an “Investor” relating to an

“Investment” as defined in the Treaty.

No clear time clements are contained in the notion of an “investment dispute”, or in the definition
of an investor within the Treaty text. An “investment dispute” is equally capable of referring to
a dispute regarding a past investment as to a dispute in respect of an investment presently existing.
The identification of the “Host Contracting Party” and “Home Contracting Party” by reference to
where “the invesiment is made” (in the present tense) could imply a requirement that a corporate
entity presently hold an investment to qualify as an investor, but could also be intended as time-
neutral formulation, to apply more broadly. The Tribunal notes that certain elements of the Treaty

{such as the encouragement and admission of “investments by investors”*™)

) would necessarily
apply before an investment is made within the territory of the Host Contracting Party. Moreover,
reading a time element into the definition of investor for legal persons would only introduce a
distinction between legal persons and natural persons for which no rational basis is apparent.
Accordingly, the Tribunal is unwilling to find a specific time restriction for the determination of

its jurisdiction within this definition.

Taken as a whole, the Tribunal finds that the text of the Treaty is ambiguous as to whether a
dispute may be submitted to arbitration in respect of a former investment that has been sold prior
to the commencement of arbitral proceedings. As no travaux preparatoires has been filed on the
record, the Tribunal must conclude that the Treaty does not provide an answer to this question.
As such, the Tribunal must resort to general international law and the practice of international

courts and tribunals.

In this respect, the Tribunal considers it broadly accepted that the jurisdiction of a public
international law tribunal is assessed as at the date on which the proceedings were commenced.”
The Tribunal also considers it generally recognized that this rule is subject to derogation, For
example, it was well established by the tribunal in Mondev International, Ltd. v. United States"
that a claimant who is deprived of a qualifying investment (or status as a qualifying investor) as
a result of the very measures complained of (for instance, in the case of expropriation), will not
be prevented from having recourse to dispute resolution by virtue of its lack of an investment at
the time the proceedings are commenced. This rule is axiomatic for the provision of any

meaningful protection, in particular in respect of expropriation.

In considering whether the general rule that international tribunals must assess their jurisdiction
as at the date of commencement of proceedings is absolute, the tribunal in David R. Aven, et al.
v. Republic of Costa Rica concluded as follows:
To summarize, the Tribunal finds that the relevant case law instructs that in general terms,
an investment sold after the date of Notice of Arbitration meets the criteria for an
“investment” in the terms of DR-CAFTA. On the other hand, an investor who disposes of
ownership of the investment in question before arbitral proceedings should not be eligible to

seek the Treaty’s protection, unless special circumstances are present. Such circumstances
include, inter atia, the loss of the investment by the actions of a third party or the retroactive
application of a treaty, neither of which are applicable to the matter at hand, (Emphasis
added)
The Tribunal aligns with the view of the tribunal in Aven and considers that special circumstances
may justify extending treaty protections to a claimant who voluntarily disposes of an investment
prior to initiating proceedings. Such “special” circumstances need not be “exceptional”—the
Tribunal understands the term “special” to mean that a valid reason must exist for a claimant to

prolong a claim that it would otherwise be unable to bring.

Accordingly, the question before the Tribunal is whether the explicit retention by the Claimant of
its Treaty claims in the Letter Agreement and the Supplemental Agreement prior to its transfer of
ownership in the Distributors constitutes a valid reason to prolong those claims (see {J 344 and
345 above). The Tribunal considers that such is the case. There is no reason to prohibit the
retention of Treaty claims in the absence of clear Treaty language to that effect. As noted by the

tribunal in GEA Group Akiengeselischaft vy. Ukraine, reading a requirement of continuous

ownership into the Treaty “would exclude a significant range of cases where claims are made in
respect of the divestment or expropriation of an investment.”*'' Insofar as the alleged Treaty
breaches were committed in respect of an investment held by the Claimant at the time, the
Tribunal considers that the later transfer of ownership in the investment cannot extinguish the

Claimant’s right to bring a Treaty claim in respect of those breaches.

Additionally, the Tribunal finds that, as a matter of principle, the ability of investors to mitigate
the damage arising from a treaty breach would be significantly curtailed if investors were
precluded from disposing of distressed assets before seeking redress before an investment
tribunal.$?

However, the retention of treaty claims by investors prior to the disposal of an investment should
not be unqualified. First, any retention of treaty claims must be absolute, such that any new owner
of the investment would be precluded from bringing the same treaty claim in respect of the same
facts. In the instant case, the Respondent has not questioned the validity of the Letter Agreement
or the Supplemental Agreement, or else argued that their terms would leave scope for a

duplication of claims—and the Tribunal is satisfied that they do not.

Second, a claimant must have fulfilled the treaty’s requirements for a qualifying investor and
qualifying investment at some point prior to the commencement of the dispute resolution
proceedings.* In this regard, it is common ground between the Parties that the Claimant owned
an investment in Guatemala, at least, until December 2017°'"—that is, two months before the
Claimant served on the Respondent its Notice of Arbitration, which, under Article 3(2) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, constitutes the date of commencement of proceedings.

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant is eligible to seek Treaty protection by virtue
of its retention of its Treaty claims through the Leiter Agreement and the Supplemental
Agreement (see {J 344 and 345 above).

as a result of the Claimant having sold its shares in the Distributors.

2. The Claimant’s Standing
(a) The Parties’ Arguments
The Respondent's Position

The Respondent submits that the Claimant has no standing to make a claim for damages suffered
directly by the Distributors,*'> and any claim “should be limited to its rights as shareholders.”5!®
The Respondent relies on cases including Enkev Beheer B.V. v. Republic of Poland®"” and El Paso
Energy International Company v. Republic of Argentina®™* for the proposition that rights arising
from shares do not entitle shareholders to claim damages suffered by the company. According to
the Respondent, a specific provision in the Treaty would be required for the Claimant to be able

to claim damages suffered by the Distributors.*!

For the Respondent, the damages claimed by the Claimant prior to and including 2017 are those
“suffered directly by the Distributors”, and do not relate to the Claimant’s role as shareholder. [n
the Respondent’s view, the Claimant therefore has no standing to make a claim for the “alleged

damages suffered.”>

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant contends that it can bring its claim as shareholder in the Distributors.”' The

Claimant notes the Respondent’s argument that it has standing only for claims for damages “it

personally suffered”, *”* and states that “[tJhis is precisely the object of IC Power’s claim.”** The
Claimant submits that Article 1(a) of the Treaty, defining “investment”, includes “rights derived
from stocks, shares, bonds, debentures and other kinds of interests in legal entities.”** As such,
a claimant with “shares in a relevant legal entity”** has an investment and can “bring a claim for
damage that it has suffered as a result of a breach of the Treaty.”° According to the Claimant,
“the right of shareholders to seek protection for direct damages suffered as a result of measures
taken against the company in which they hold shares is firmly established in international

investment law”,*” and “scores of tribunals have recognized the right of a parent corporation to

bring a treaty claim against the host state for damages sustained by its local subsidiary.”**

The Claimant criticizes the Respondent's reliance on BG Group Pie v. Republic of Argentina and
argues that the BG Group tribunal was aware that that the claimant’s claims were derived from
measutes taken against the claimant’s local subsidiaries.*”° The Claimant submits that BG tribunal
nonetheless held that it had jurisdiction related to the Claimant's “indirect shareholding.”*° The
Claimant likewise disagrees with the Respondent's characterisation of Enkev Beheer v. Poland
and E/ Paso v. Argentina, arguing that both allowed the relevant claimant to claim for the

diminution in value of the shares it held.*!

The Claimant was, at least during the period in which it was the owner of the Distributors, an
“investor” within the meaning of Article 1(1)(d) of the Treaty, being a legal entity organized
under the [aw of Israel, being the Home Contracting Party in respect of an investment in the shares
of the Distributors. As such, but for the question of the timing of the Claimant’s investment
discussed above, the Claimant was entitled to initiate the dispute resolution provisions of Article 8

in respect of measure affecting its investment.

In the Tribunal’s view, the point raised by the Respondent properly goes to the question of
quantum, insofar as the effects of the Goverament’s measures on the Distributors may not directly
equate to their effect on the Claimant. In this respect, the Claimant would only potentially be
entitled to claim for the value of damages incurred by the Claimant itself, to the extent that these
differ from those incurred by the Distributors.

Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s objection that it lacks jurisdiction as a result

of the Claimant’s lack of standing.

3. Due Diligence and Abuse of Investment Arbitration
(a) The Parties’ Arguments
The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s actions “constitute an abuse of investment
arbitration and must therefore be dismissed by the Tribunal.”*>? According to the Respondent:

IC Power acquired a shareholding in the distributors knowing -- or should have known — that
they had with it more than $100 million of tax contingency. This is clearly stated in the due
diligence by IC Power. The contingency materialised, and IC Power decided to start this
arbitration against the state with the single purpose of curing its negligence when acquiring
Energuate and the distributors.*?

 

Relying on Orascom TMT Investments v, People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, the
Respondent defines abuse as “the use of procedural instruments or rights by one or more parties
for purposes that are alien to those for which the procedural rights were established.”**

According to the Respondent, a finding of abuse of process will depend “on the objective

circumstances of each case and not on the intention of the parties.”** The Respondent contests
the Claimant’s emphasis on “good faith”, quoting Phillip Morris for the proposition that “the

notion of abuse does not imply a showing of bad faith . . . [but] is subject to an objective test.”*°*

Recalling Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain, and further cases including CMS Gas
Transmission Company v. Republic of Argentina and Société Générale In respect of DR Energy
Holdings Limited & Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este v. Dominican Republic, the

Respondent argues that “bilateral investment agreements are not insurance policies against bad

 

business decisions.”*” According to the akey obligation on foreign investors is “to
conduct an appropriate due diligence proceeding when they make their investment.”*"* The

Respondent submits that had the Claimant “conducted a true due diligence process,
have taken “preventive measures”*” against the tax issues at hand. The Respondent considers
that the Claimant, after having failed to conduct the due diligence process and being unable
otherwise to recover capital invested in the Distributors, “intends to use the Treaty as an insurance
policy against its own bad business decisions.”**! This, according to the Respondent, amounts to

an abuse of the proceedings.*”

With respect to the Claimant’s lack of due diligence, the Respondent elaborates as follows:

First, Respondent submits that the Claimant cannot provide “serious documents’**
establishing that it carried out a “tax diligence” process, as was recommended by its

financial and accounting advisers. °4*

Second, the Respondent contends that the documents provided to the Claimant for its due
diligence process “were full of red flags about a possible tax fraud in the creation and claim

of the Tax Deductions.”

Third, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's conduct is effectively “nothing but a
way to remedy its own negligence in the purchase of the Distributors’ shares." In
particular, the Respondent relies on the fact that the Claimant had an “insurance policy for
non-compliance of the representations and warranties in the shares sale contract with
Actis,”“? from which, the Respondent alleges, the Claimant will be unlikely to reclaim
money. The Respondent claims that as a result, the Claimant is wrongly using the

proceedings “as a second insurance policy.”*"*

The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s view that due diligence goes to the merits, rather

than jurisdiction. Relying on Inceysa Vallisoletana SL. v. Republic of El Salvado,*” the

Respondent argues that the Tribunal, when considering its jurisdiction, may consider whatever

issues are relevant to it; examining merits issues in connection with jurisdiction is “only

inappropriate in cases where the proceedings is bifurcated.**° The Respondent notes that

international tribunals frequently examine due diligence while deciding on jurisdiction. The

Respondent also disputes the Claimant's argument that the facts of the present case differ from

other instances where abuse of process has been found; in the Respondent’s view, “there is no

comprehensive list of all the circumstances in which an abuse can be found.”**' Finally, the

Respondent considers IC Power’s alleged inability to take legal action against Actis as evidence
of its negligence in acquiring the shares.** The Respondent also submits that IC Power has made

assertions in its proceedings against AIG that contradict those in the present arbitration.>?

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s claim of abuse of investment proceedings being present
here. In the Claimant's view, both the Respondent's allegations of treating the Treaty as an

o2554

“insurance policy”*™ and of lack of due diligence on the Claimant’s part are unsupported, and in

any case would “not meet the legal threshold to establish an abuse of process in any form.”***
The Claimant submits that the Respondent “bears the burden of proving the existence of an abuse
of process.”*** Quoting Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Corporation v. Republic of
Ecuador I, the Claimant contends that a tribunal will find abuse of process only “in very
exceptional circumstances.” The Claimant's view is that “the threshold for finding an abuse of
process [is] high”*** and “abuse of process would require a serious departure from the principle
of good faith.”>°°

According to the Claimant, the question of adequate due diligence goes directly to the merits of
the case and “has no bearing upon the jurisdiction [of] the tribunal or the admissibility of IC
Power's claims.”° The Claimant argues that the assessment of whether due diligence was
sufficient “would require making a factual determination contrary to the claimant’s stated case,
which would be inappropriate as part of a jurisdictional determination.”°*' The Claimant further

29562,

submits that it did nonetheless “conduct a proper due diligence’ process. The Claimant also

contests the relevance of potential claims against Actis, arguing that “Guatemala points to no

provision of the SPA that Actis allegedly breached, including any fraud in connection with its
9563

representations to IC Power.
The Claimant submits that the authorities cited by the Respondent “cannot be compared with the
circumstances of the present case.”*" In particular, Philip Morris Asia v. Australia is “a case of
corporate restructuring after the investment dispute was foreseeable . .. which is not an issue in
the present case”*** and Maffezini y. Spain “did not deal with an issue of abuse of process, and
made the point that a BIT is not an insurance policy only in the context of whether Mr. Maffezini’s
claim had merit.”* The Claimant likewise distinguishes Iberdrola v. Republic of Guatemala and
Incesya y. El Salvador." As such, the Claimant does not believe there is any support for the
“Respondent’s objection that IC Power’s claims are inadmissible due to a supposed abuse of the

arbitral process.”**

(b) The Tribunal’s Considerations

The Tribunal takes note of the Respondent’s objection, but does not consider that it raises an issue

that properly goes to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

As the Tribunal understands the Respondent’s objection, it is that the Claimant failed to engage
in due diligence to such an extent that it could not possibly prevail on the merits, rendering
recourse to investment arbitration abusive. The Claimant contests this assertion as a matter of
fact, and the Tribunal considers this a matter more appropriately addressed as part of the merits.
Moreover, the extent to which due diligence is indeed a required element of the Claimant’s claims

would also be an issue going to the merits.

The Tribunal recognizes that courts and tribunals may be called upon to make factual
determinations in the course of considering an objection to jurisdiction, in particular when such
an objection is p d in bi d di as a prelimi matter. In such

circumstances, however, a court or tribunal may also determine that a jurisdictional objection

does not have an exclusively preliminary character and defer it for further consideration in

conjunction with the merits. In contrast to other instances when investment tribunals have been
called on to consider issues of abuse of process, the Respondent's objection does not concern
discrete factual circumstances, such as a corporate restructuring, but is predicated on the
Claimant’s claims being substantively without merit. This is not a determination that can be made

on a preliminary basis as a question of jurisdiction.

Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s objection that it lacks jurisdiction as a result

of the Claimant's abuse of process.

4. Domestic or International Law
(a) The Parties’ Arguments
The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the grounds that the Parties’ dispute
relates solely to “violations of domestic law”. Effectively, the Respondent argues, the Tribunal
is being asked to act as a domestic or appellate comt on matiers of Guatemalan Law. The
Respondent states that “an international investment tribunal has jurisdiction only over claims of
international law,”5”° and contends that “IC Power’s claim is no more than a desperate attempt to
‘manufacture an international dispute out of a purely domestic dispute.’”?7!

Relying on EDF International S.A, SAUR International S.A. and Leén Participaciones
Argentinas S.A, v. Republic of Argentina,” the Respondent argues that investment tribunals are

not empowered “to rule on disputes of exclusively domestic law.”57?

The Respondent cites

and Serbia) and Payment in Geld of the Brazilian Loans Issued in France (France v. Brazil) for

the proposition that “[flor the Court itself to undertake ifs own construction of municipal law .. .

Respondent’s opinion, “an international tribunal cannot act either as a court of first instance or as

413. The Respondent looks to ADF Group Inc. vy. United States of America,” Generation Ukraine,

Inc. v. Ukraine,” Iberdrola v. Republic of Guatemala™ and International Thunderbird Gaming

international tribunal is “not a court of first instance that can discuss the legality of the State’s

and second “when the precautionary measures were decreed.”“*” The Respondent
analogises the case to /berdrola v. Republic of Guatemala, wherein “the disputes the Claimant
asks the Tribunal to decide on, refer to Guatemalan law”*** and contends that “the essential basis
of the Claimant’s claims relate exclusively to a dispute under Guatemalan law that should be
adjudicated by . . . State courts.”5*?

The Respondent submits that each of the Claimant’s claims relates to “a violation of the Tax
Code”*** and is founded on “an incorrect interpretation of the Binding Opinions”*?'—that is to
say, its submissions are “geared to demonstrating an alleged violation of Guatemalan taw.”*”*
The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s arguments regarding the Criminal Complaint are an
attempt “to have the Tribunal rule de novo on matters that have already been decided”*” by

domestic courts.

The Respondent also disagrees with the Claimant’s position that administrative proceedings must
“be exhausted’** before criminal proceedings can be commenced, and hence that the

commencement of the Criminal Proceedings provide a ground on which the Tribunal can make a

 

ruling, ‘ding to the Respondent “by the exis of items of evidence of tax

 

fraud, the SAT has the obligation to suspend the administrative proceedings and immediately file

a complaint with the competent authority.”

The Respondent further states that “the Claimant’s claim regarding the precautionary

courts and it is “not up to the Tribunal to decide as if it were a court of appeals.”*° The

the proceedings are still in train, “the Guatemalan courts have already issued decisions”®”’ on the

Claimant’s case,

418. The Respondent's view is that it is not sufficient that the Parties disagree on the application of the

Treaty, and asserts that every matter at issue is a specific question of Guatemalan law:

(i) whether the SAT violated Guatemalan law when it presented the Criminal Complaint,
allegedly against the provisions of the Binding Opinions; (ii) whether the SAT violated
Guatemalan law by not having exhausted an administrative procedure before filing the
Criminal Complaint in order to establish the tax underpayment with certainty, and/or not
having ext da civil i iblish the existence of mi: ion; and (iii)
whether the precautionary measures were illegal under Guatemalan law.>*

According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s analysis focuses entirely on Guatemala’s domestic
law, with little argument on “its rights under the Treaty.”*”? Instead, the Respondent submits, the
Claimant “limits itself to repeating over and over again its arguments on the supposed violations

of Guatemalan law.”

420. First, the Claimant submits that “[iJt is well established that a State may not rely on its own

421.

internal law to avoid international obligations."©* Accordingly:

The mere fact that the State invokes its own authority under domestic law to take certain
actions vis-a-vis a protected investment does not divest the tribunal of jurisdiction to
determine whether the State acted in breach of its international obligation to accord fair and
equitable treatment to covered foreign investments.
The Claimant submits that “the Parties clearly disagree on points of law and fact concerning the
application of the Treaty, as Respondent denies that its actions . . . constitute violations of its
international obligations.” Recalling the definition of a “dispute” in Mavrommatis Palestine
Concessions (Greece v. U.K.), the Claimant concludes than an international law dispute exists.”
The Claimant submits that tribunals can look at State compliance with domestic laws without
“render[ing] the claims themselves domestic” and asserts that its references to domestic law
breaches are only “in the context of substantiating Claimant’s assertions that Respondent has
breached various Treaty standards.” %*
The Claimant argues that the Respondent has mischaracterised the cases Iberdrola v. Republic of
Guatemala and Generation Ukraine, Inc. v. Ukraine. In terms of Iberdrola v. Republic of
Guatemala, the Claimant considers that the tribunal dismissed the claimant’s claims as it had

argued only that “Guatemala’s actions violated Guatemalan law”®!?

and not explained “how those
actions violated Respondent’s treaty obligations under the Spain-Guatemala BIT.”*!’ With
Generation v. Ukraine, too, the Claimant considers that the facts are distinct from the
circumstances here, “which cleatly constitute violations of the Treaty and international faw.”*”

The Claimant instead analogises with TECO v. Guatemaia®' where, despite the dispute involving

treatment under domestic law, the tribunal found that this was “an international dispute” and did

not accept “Guatemala’s argument that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear TECO’s

claims given the domestic law issues involved.”

422. Finally, the Claimant submits that the Respondent is “mistaken” in suggesting that the Tribunal

423.

cannot “rule de ovo on matters that have already been decided.”*'* The Claimant first states that
“the matter has not been ruled upon by Guatemala courts”*”* and “there has not even been an
indictment, let alone a ruling by a domestic court.”*"” Second, the Claimant affirms that “a breach
of the Treaty standards occurs irrespective of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the measures
under domestic law, and without the Tribunal having to act as an appellate court.”*'® Third, the
Claimant contends that the “Respondent’s position appears to be that whenever a treaty claim
involves domestic law issues, those issues should be resolved by the local courts.”*"? The
Claimant argues the Respondent was incorrect in referencing International Thunderbird Gaming
Corporation v. The Government of the United Mexican States, as “the tribunal in Thunderbird did
not determine whether Mexico’s actions were in conformity with local law”,S”° and was able to
assess international obligations under NAFTA. The Claimant’s position is that it is not “asking
this Tribunal to act as a domestic court, but rather to assess the arbitrary nature of Respondent’s

actions under international law.”®!

According to the Claimant, this Tribunal therefore “has
jurisdiction to consider issues of Guatemalan law in determining whether Guatemala’s actions

breached the relevant international law standards undet the Treaty.”

(b) The Tribanal’s Considerations

In its submissions before the Tribunal, the Claimant has identified measures that it considers to
constitute breaches of the Treaty as a matter of public international! law. The Respondent does
not contest this, and indeed its submissions deal extensively with the application of international
investment law. As the Tribunal understands the Respondent’s objection, it is not that the

Claimant has not invoked a public international law claim. That the Ciaimant has done so is self-

evident. Rather, the Tribunal understands the Respondent’s objection to be that the dispute
between the Parties is, at its core, a matter of Guatemalan jaw, such that the international law
claims advanced by the Claimant are ancillary to the true nature of the dispute and that their
success or failure will depend entirely upon the resolution of questions of Guatemalan law that
remain pending before the Guatemalan Courts.

The Tribunal considers it well established in public international law that it is for the Tribunal
“itself ‘while giving particular attention to the formulation of the dispute chosen by the Applicant,
to determine on an objective basis the dispute dividing the parties, by examining the position of
both parties’ and in the process ‘to isolate the real issue in the case and to identify the object of
the claim’.”©? Viewed on an objective basis, the Tribunal considers that there is, without doubt,
a dispute between the Parties concerning matters of Guatemalan law, a dispute that remains
pending between the Government and the Distributors in the courts of Guatemala. However, the
Tribunal also considers that the Claimant has presented a dispute concerning the application of
the Treaty and the consequences, if any, that follow from it as a matter of public international law.
The Tribunal considers it commonplace that the Parties may be in dispute both with respect to
municipal and international law. Whether this is seen as separate disputes or as two aspects of a
single dispute is ultimately of little import. It is equally weil established, however, that a Tribunal
need not “decline to take cognizance of one aspect of a dispute merely because that dispute has

other aspects, however important.”

The Tribunal is cognizant that the Claimant’s Treaty claims are predicated in part on matters of
Guatemalan law, plead as a matter of fact in these proceedings. The fact that such matters remain
pending in the Courts of Guatemala may well limit the determinations that the Tribunal is
presently able to make with respect to the substance of the Claimant’s Treaty claims. It does not,
however, suffice to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction over a dispute concerning the application
of the Treaty as a matter of public international law.

Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s objection that it lacks jurisdiction as a result
of the Claimant having commenced arbitration in respect of a dispute concerning Guatemalan

law.

5. Claimant’s Prima Facie Case for a Violation of the Treaty
(a) The Parties’ Arguments

The Respondent's Position

427. In the Respondent’s view the Claimant must show “prima facie, a violation of the Treaty that, in

turn, can provide a legal basis tor the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”*° According to the Respondent,
“a simple violation of Guatemalan law . . . does not constitute per se a breach of an international
investment treaty or, in general, of i ional law.”*® The Resp relies upon Elettronica
Sicula S.p.A. for the principle that “the fact that an act of a public authority may have been
untawful in municipal law does not necessarily mean that act was unlawful in international
law.”*7 According to the Respondent, the Claimant relies solely on “alleged violations of
Guatemalan law as the basis of its claims under the Treaty”*** and does not make an appropriate

prima facie case on which to ground jurisdiction,

428. The Respondent contends that the “claimant’s mere classification of its claims .. . is irrelevant

626

or

ol

for the analysis of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.”*” Further, according to the Respondent, “IC
Power ignores that the prima facie test necessarily implies an analysis of the Jegal standard
applicable to the facts set forth by the claimant in order to establish whether those facts could
violate the invoked legal norm.” The Respondent quotes Judge Rosalyn Higgins in Off Platforms
(slamie Republic of Iran v. United States of America)™ as authority for the requirement of a
“detailed analysis” of relevant issucs when deciding whether the requisite prima facie basis is
present.' The Respondent asserts that the Claimant does not sufficiently demonstrate “a
violation of the treaty standards” in either of its submissions, suggesting that the Claimant merely

repeats “that its claims are a matter of international law without explaining in what way the simple

violation of Guatemalan law ... could constitute a violation of the treaty." As such, the

Respondent maintains that a prima facie case is not made out.

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant argues that when determining the prima facie standard, the “relevant question is
the claimant’s own characterization of the facts." Relying on Chevron Corp and Texaco
Petroleum Corp. v. Ecuador, the Claimant submits that for the prima facie test “it should be
presumed that the Claimant’s factual allegations are true.”°* The Claimant states that the test is
“two-pronged”: first, that tribunals “base their jurisdictional decision on the facts as pleaded by
the claimant”;®> and second, that tribunals decide whether these facts “fairly raise questions of
breach or may constitute possible breaches of one or more substantive treaty provision.” The
Claimant submits that by putting forward arguments on the Respondent’s “arbitrary,
unreasonable, and disproportionate”*” measures it has demonstrated violation of the treaty and
“made a sufficient prima facie showing for jurisdictional purpose.”** The Claimant argues that
further considerations—such as whether the acts “give rise to liability under the Treaty”®*—are

matters to be decided “with the merits of the case,”*"” and not with respect to jurisdiction.

(b) The Tribunal’s Considerations

The Tribunal takes note of the Parties’ discussion of the need for a claimant to make out a prima
facie case on the merits of its claims, but does not see that it is relevant in the present
circumstances, where issues of jurisdiction are being considered together with the merits, rather

than in a separate preliminary phase.

As the Tribunal understands the requirement, where an objection is made that a claimant's claims

do not arise under the treaty or other relevant instrument, a claimant in bifurcated proceedings

should set out the elements of its claims in sufficient detail for a tribunal to conclude prima facie
that—taking the facts alleged by the claimant as true—relief in favour of the claimant could
possibly be granted. Absent such a prima facie showing, a tribunal may reasonably dismiss a

claim as a preliminary matter without further submissions on the merits.

In the present case, no bifurcation was requested and the Claimant has made a full presentation
of its claims, Were the Tribunal to determine that the Claimant has failed to state a claim for
which relief can be granted, this would be a rejection of the Claimant’s claims on the merits, not

a jurisdictional determination.

In any event, the Tribunal understands the Respondent objection to be that the Claimant’s claims

 

are based on the actions of the Guatemalan judiciary applying Guatemalan law. Because, in the
Respondent’s view, judicial actions cannot constitute a breach of the Treaty except through denial
of justice (which the Claimant has not alleged), the Respondent considers that no possible claim
has been stated. As set out in greater detail in the following section, the Tribunal notes that the
Claimant has stated a claim with respect to the actions of the SAT, which is not a judicial organ,
and that the extent to which the judicial organs of a State may incur international responsibility
other than through denial of justice, is an open question of law. As such, the ‘Iribunal considers
that the Claimant has made out a prima facie claim, were that analysis relevant in the present

procedural posture of the proceedings.

In any event, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s objection that it lacks jurisdiction as a result

of the Claimant having failed to articulate a prima facie claim.

6. Denial of Justice or Procedural Error
(a) Requirement for Denial of Justice
The Respondent's Position

The Respondent submits that a State is only liable “for the decisions of its domestic courts—and
for the conduct of other bodies supported by its domestic courts—~if the Claimant is able to prove
a denial of justice or a procedural error of equal gravity."“ The Respondent relies on Robert
Azinian, et al. v. United States of Mexice for the argument that to demonstrate a violation of

international taw, “the Ciaimant must show either a denial of justice, or a pretense of form to

achieve an intentionally unlawful end.”“? Moreover, the Respondent argues, international courts
apply “unequal treatment and deference”“ to any analysis of the decisions of domestic courts,
and that domestic courts’ decisions are held to a higher standard than “the other branches of the
State” in determining a denial of justice. The Respondent argues this principle is confirmed by
multiple cases and current doctrine, specifically referencing work by Professor Jan Paulsson.“
Recalling the finding in Swisstion DOO Skopje v. Former Republic of Macedonia, the Respondent
contends that otherwise “any judgment adverse to an investor’s interests could constitute a [treaty]
violation.”*"¢

The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s efforts to limit and distinguish the authorities it
cites. According to the Respondent, Robert Azinian, et al. v. United States of Mexico was not
limited to disputes before a contractually specified forum, but “applies to any judicial decision on
matters of domestic law of the competent courts of the State.”“” Similarly, the Respondent
submits that Glencore International A.G. and C.1. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia ™* and
OI European Group B. V. y. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela“? do not simply treat denial of
justice as “one of many FET violations, but rather make it clear that “the international standard
to assess whether a legal decision is in accordance with the FET guarantee is the denial of
justice." The Respondent also considers these authorities to establish that the denial of justice

requirement applies generally to violations of the treaty, not just the FET standard.**!

Conversely, the Respondent submits that the Claimant mischaracterizes the authorities it
advances. In the Respondent’s view, each of the Claimant's cases actually demonstrates that
international law claims against domestic judicial decisions “can only succeed when there are
serious irregularities surrounding the judicial process or the decision itself which, for all practical

29652

purposes, are equal to a denial of justice.’ Examining Saipem v. Bangladesh, Sistem

Mithendislik v. Kyrgyz Republie,®* and Eli Lilly v. Canada,®> the Respondent argues that:
[E]ach of these cases confirms that the claims against domestic judicial decisions are vatid
only when there are grave irregularities that surrounded the judicial proceeding or the
decision itself that for all practical purposes amount to a denial of justice that caused the
decision to be illegal under international law.
According to the Respondent, the requirement for a denial of justice is not limited to questions of
judicial action. The Respondent further submits that “a State cannot be liable for acting in
accordance with the decisions of its domestic courts unless a denial of justice is demonstrated"?
Thus, the Respondent contends that the SAT cannot be liable in the absence of any denial of
justice by the courts. Relying again on Robert Azinian, et al. v. United States of Mexico,° as
well as Liman Caspian Oil BV & NCL Dutch Investment BV v. Republic of Kazakhstan ™ and
dberdrola v. Republic of Guatemala, the Respondent states that if a judicial decision “that
interprets domestic law does not constitute a violation of international law, the entities or officials

whose conduct was supported by that decision cannot violate it either.”®!

The Respondent contests the Claimant’s assertion that the SAT was not acting pursuant to a

decision of the Guatemalan courts. The Respondent recalls Robert Azinian, et al. v. United States

of Mexico for the view that it is sufficient that “the actions for which the Claimant condemns the
SAT were subsequently upheld by the Guatemalan courts.” According to the Respondent, an
international tribunal is not paralyzed by domestic courts’ approval of government action, but

must then show “that the court decision itself constitutes a violation of the treaty.”

Finally, the
Respondent distinguishes Ziser Infrastructure Limited and Energia Solar Luxembourg 8. a r.1. v.
Kingdom of Spain and 9REN v. Kingdom of Spain, as these “did not rest on alleged violations
of domestic law . . . but on an abrupt and complete change of the regulatory framework applicable

to the investment."

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant first submits that the Respondent’s argument on the requirement for a denial of
justice “goes to the merits of the case, rather than jurisdiction, as it calls for the substantive
assessment of the Treaty standards and their application to the facts of the case"? The Claimant
then contends that the Respondent’s view “that a denial of justice is required for a judicial measure
to result in a breach of a BIT is incorrect.”* According to the Claimant, “the legal scholars that
Respondent cites . . . do not support the argument that a denial of justice is the only means by
which a judicial measure can lead to a breach of international law.” Properly construed, the
Claimant considers Professor Paulsson’s position to be that “courts may violate an international

9670

obligation when they failed to comply with a treaty obligation,”*” even in the absence of a denial

of justice. The Claimant also criticises the Respondent's authorities, including Robert Azinian, et

al. v. United States of Mexico.”' The Claimant submits that this case is “of limited relevance”®”
as it “involved allegations of breach of contract, which by themselves do not ordinarily result in
[the] finding of an international wrongful act.”673

441, The Claimant relies on Saipem S.p.A. v. The People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Sistem
Mithendislik v. Kyrgyz Republic,®* and Eli Lilly and Co. v. Government of Canada," “as
examples of cases where judicial acts could result in a breach of an investment treaty.”°” In terms
of both Saipem S.p.A. v. The People's Republic of Bangladesh and Sistem Miihendislik v. Kyrgyz
Republic, the Claimant states that expropriations had taken place “without a finding of denial of
justice.” In particular, in Saipem S.p.A. v. The People's Republic of Bangladesh, the tribunal
noted that while “expropriation by the courts presupposes that the courts’ intervention was illegal,
this does not mean that expropriation by a court necessarily presupposes a denial of justice.°*
In Efi Lilly and Co. v. Government of Canada, the Claimant argues, the tribunal recognised that
courts can engage in conduct implicating a party’s obligations under a treaty, even if “not cast in
denial of justice terms.”*” The Claimant therefore concludes that in terms of “court measures”,
the “absence of a finding or claim of denial of justice”®" does not mean that denial of justice is a
“prerequisite to international liability.”

442. The Claimant then disputes the Respondent’s argument that the requirement for a denial of justice
also extends to the SAT’s actions. According to the Claimant:

Investment treaty jurisprudence is repiete with cases finding treaty violations on account of

a State’s legislative or regulatory actions where there has been no finding of a denial of justice

by the State’s courts, irrespective of whether the judiciary was implicated.
The Claimant further distinguishes Robert Azinian, et al. v. United States of Mexico and Liman
Caspian Oil BV & NCL Dutch Investment BV v. Republic of Kazakhstan.’ The Claimant’s
position is that “these decisions are inapposite”®** as “[t]he SAT was not acting pursuant to a
decision taken by the local courts; instead, the SAT disregarded the Binding Tax Opinions”**’
and committed further “treaty breaches.”** The Claimant submits that these cases have also been
misinterpreted by the Respondent: for instance, the Claimant recalls that Robert Azinian, et al. v.
United States of Mexico held that an international tribunal “is not paralyzed by the fact that the

national courts have approved the relevant conduct of public officials.”

{b) Existence of Denial of Justice
The Respondent's Position

‘The Respondent submits that the Guatemalan courts did not deny justice to IC Power and that

have therefore committed no violation of international law.

‘The Respondent contends that denial of justice requires that (3) “serious procedural errors”* have

Caspian Oil BV & NCL Dutch Investment BV v. Republic of Kazakhstan™ to argue that denial of
justice further requires “a fundamental failute of the judicial system [to be] present in its
entirety." In other words, a single failure at the first instance is insufficient if the appellate

mechanisms have not had the opportunity to address the error.

The Respondent submits that such failure is not present here, and that there is therefore no denial
of justice. In support of this position, the Respondent first submits that the “supposed substantive
errors of the Criminal Court and the Court of Appeals” raised by the Claimant are not
procedural, and hence do not satisfy the criterion for denial of justice. The Respondent then
argues that the Distributors’ decision not to challenge “the precautionary measures” precludes
denial of justice as the Claimant opted not to “utilize the appeals provided for in Guatemalan
law”, such as “nullity appeal or an amparo action." According to the Respondent, this
ensured that “Guatemalan courts did not even have the opportunity to amend it.” Third, the
Respondent contends, due process was at all times respected in the Criminal Court. Finally, the
Respondent submits, as “[criminal} proceedings are still in the investigation stage” and are in

no way complete, there cannot yet be a denial of justice.

Similarly, the Respondent then submits that the SAT did not deny justice to the Claimant. The
Respondent submits that if the Criminal Court and Court of Appeals committed no denial of

justice, the SAT is similarly not liable under international law.?°°

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant does not specifically address whether a denial of justice could indeed be established,

limiting its arguments to disputing the fact that this requirement exists at all. However, the

Claimant does make it clear it di with the Resp s of the facts, ii

in the extent to which the SAT’s behaviour violated the treaty”!

(c) The Tribunal’s Considerations

The Tribunal takes note of the Respondent’s objection, but does not consider that it raises an issue

that properly goes to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

As the Tribunal understands the Respondent’s objection, it is that the State measures identified
by the Claimant as constituting Treaty breaches cannot give rise to a violation of international law
unless they are characterized as a denial of justice. This is so, the Respondent avers, because the
state measures in question are either actions of the Guatemalan judiciary or measures taken by

the SAT and sanctioned by the judiciary.

As advanced above, the Tribunal recalls that the extent to which the actions of judicial organs of
a state may constitute violations of international law other than through denial of justice is an
open question of law.” Without needing to resolve that question for present purposes, it suffices
to note that the Claimant’s claims concerning judicial action cannot be dismissed as a matter of
principle for failure to state a denial of justice claim. The Tribunal is required to assess whether
such judicial action may engage the liability of the State under the Treaty standards that were

actually relied upon by the Claimant—a quintessential merits question.

In any event, the Tribunal observes that the Claimant’s claims are principally concerned, not with
the actions of the Guatemalan judiciary, but the SAT—an administrative organ which, according
to the Claimant, committed Treaty breaches that were unrelated to any decisions taken by the
local courts.”* This raises the question of whether the denial of justice standard should be
extended to administrative conduct sanctioned by the judiciary and, if so, whether the actions of
the SAT were effectively sanctioned by the Guatemalan judiciary in the instant case. These are

not determinations that can be made on a preliminary basis as a question of jurisdiction.

As a result, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s objection that it lacks jurisdiction over the

Claimant's claims for failure to stale a denial of justice claim.

ADMISSIBILITY OF CLAIMS
1 The Parties’ Arguments

The Respondent's Position

454. The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s claims are inadmissible by reason of being

premature. The Respondent recalls Achmea B.V. v. Slovak Republic If,” for the position that
“investment tribunals lack competence to rule on hypothetical or premature claims.”” The
Respondent aiso quotes the International Court of Justice in Northern Cameroons (Cameroon y.
United Kingdom) to contend that a tribunal’s decision “must have some practical consequences
in the sense that it can affect existing legal rights or obligations of the parties.””* The Respondent
submits that “without any damage, the alleged dispute would not have a practical consequence

and therefore there would not be a dispute under international law.””"”

455. Im the present case, the Respondent submits that the “payment of the taxes, fines and interest

pertaining to fiscal years 2011 to 2015”7°5 are—according to the Guatemalan Tax Code” —of a

“provisional nature.”7!°

The Respondent further notes that “the criminal investigation still
continues” and hence that “the competence to determine the existence of a tax underpayment”
rests with the Prosecutor’s Office and then the Criminal Court.”!! The Respondent submits that
“the Criminal Court accepted the arguments of the Distributors with respect to the defects in the
settlement of the defrauded taxes that served as the basis for the precautionary measures.” In the
Respondent’s view, at this point the Distributors simply had to make a request of the SAT that

“the wrongly paid amount be refunded.””" The Respondent also draws attention to the

Claimant’s sale of its share in the Distributors prior to the conclusion of criminal investigations

as further evidence that the claims are premature.”

The Respondent considers the Claimant’s answer on this point to confirm that the claims are

premature:

(a) First, insofar as the Claimant invokes the length of the criminal investigation without
resolution, the Respondent considers this to confirm that the present “claims are purely

preventive and, consequently, premature.”7!*

(b) Second, the Respondent submits that “the Criminal Court already ordered the SAT to
compensate the payments received in February 2015 as a consequence of the Rectifications
made by the Distributors.”7"? Whether or not this involves the principal amounts in dispute,

its shows the premature nature of the claims.”°

(c) _ Third, the Respondent argues that the SAT did not characterize payments as final and that
“the Criminal Proceeding is still ongoing and that the SAT must comply with any decision
by the Criminal Court,”7"”

(4d) Finally, the Respondent considers the assertion that the damage has been “fully
crystallized” with the Claimant's sale of the Distributors is incorrect.”° This was a

business decision, while the Criminal Proceeding remained ongoing."

The Claimant's Position

‘The Claimant submits that its claims are admissible and not premature. The Claimant first objects
to the Respondent’s argument on the need for the dispute to involve “practical consequences”

involving “damage””* to the Claimant. According to the Claimant, “whether Claimant suffered

damages has no bearing upon the jurisdiction of the Tribunal””—rather, it is enough that it

“suffered an injury.”7?

The Claimant then argues that the dispute does have practical
consequences: “{t]he Distributors made tens of millions of dollars in payments to Respondent, as

a result of which Ciaimant’s investment in Guatemala has been severely prejudiced,””?

The Claimant submits its claims are not premature for the following reasons:

(a) The SAT’s position “that payments under protest are final,” is erroneous;

(6} The proceedings are “still in the investigation stage . .. with no end in sight;”725

(©) The Criminal Court’s finding “has nothing to do with the principal amounts at issue;"”*6

(d) “The fact that IC Power sold its interest in the Distributors does not mean that it did not
suffer any damage as a result of Guatemala’s measures.””” Rather, “it means that the
damage is fully crystallized.””*

The Claimant contests the Respondent's reliance on Achmea B.V. v. Slovak Republic I” and
Northern Cameroons (Cameroon v. United Kingdom).”° In regard to the former, the Claimant
suggests that the tribunal in that case held it could not look “into the future to examine a State
conduct that had not yet materialized” while, by contrast, the current case involves “very specific
measures that have already had a substantial impact on Claimant.” in relation to the latter case,
the Claimant cites the International Court of Justice's view that it may adjudicate on “an actual

controversy involving a conflict of legal interest between the parties” and that its judgment “must

have some practical consequence. The Claimant is clear in its belief that the type of

controversy foreshadowed in Northern Cameroons (Cameroon v. United Kingdom) exists here.

2. The Tribunal’s Considerations

As noted above with respect to the Respondent’s objection concerning Guatemalan law claims,
the Tribunal is fully cognizant that the Claimant’s Treaty claims are predicated in part on matters
of Guatemalan law, plead as a matter of fact in these proceedings. The Tribunal is further aware
that certain such matters remain pending in the Courts of Guatemala. The Tribunal does not see,

however, that this gives rise to a general objection to the Claimant’s claims as premature.

In the Tribunal’s view, consideration of the implication of the pending proceedings in the Courts
of Guatemala requires the specific examination of the extent to which the measures complained
of by the Claimant are linked to the ongoing proceedings or distinct, and the extent to which the
exhaustion of local remedies is or is not a required element of the Claimant’s claims. The Tribunal
considers it preferable to consider the limits on the determinations that it may make in the course

of considering the Claimant's individual claims, rather than as an overall matter of admissibility.

Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's objection that the Claimant’s claims are

generally inadmissible in light of the ongoing judicial proceedings in Guatemala.

THE TRIBUNAL’S CONCLUSION IN RESPECT OF JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

Having considered the Respondent’s objections to its jurisdiction and the admissibility of the
Claimant’s claims, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction to entertain the Claimant’s claims

and that the Claimant’s claims are admissible.

THE MERITS OF THE CLAIMANT'S CASE

The Claimant submits that the Respondent has breached multiple aspects of the fair and equitable
treatment (“FET”) standard in Article 2(2) of the Treaty. The Claimant contends that the
Respondent has also breached Article 2(2) by imposing unreasonable measures. The Claimant
further relies on the most-favoured nation (“MIN”) provisions of Article 3 of the Treaty. The

Respondent denies having breached any provision of the Treaty.

ARTICLE 2 OF THE TREATY AND FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
Article 2(2) of the Treaty provides in relevant part as follows:

Investments made by investors of each Contracting Party shall be accorded fair and equitable
treatment...”
The Claimant submits the Respondent has breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment
(FET) through breach of the Claimant’s legitimate expectations, arbitrary conduct, breach of
procedural fairness and due process, and lack of transparency. The Respondent contends it has
not breached the FET standard.

1, The Parties’ Arguments on FET
(a) Breach of the Claimant’s Legitimate Expectations
The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent frustrated its legitimate expectations, Citing Saluka
Investments BV. v. Czech Republic,”* the Claimant characterises the protection of legitimate
expectations as “the central tenet of the FET standard.””“ The Claimant notes that the analysis
of legitimate expectations “focuses on the actions of the State upon which an investor may have
reasonably relied.””> The Claimant argues that it had a reasonable expectation “that the legal
and business environment would remain predictable and stable” and that “Guatemala would honor
its own laws and regulations regarding the Binding Tax Opinions.””** Specifically, the Claimant
submits that the Binding Tax Opinions “gave rise to IC Power’s legitimate expectations that the
Distributors were allowed to deduct the interest on the loan””’ that ASCOED and ASROED

“obtained to acquire them.””* Quoting Suez and Vivendi v. Argentina,” the Claimant states that

expectations coming from “laws, regulations, declared policies, and statements””” that “influence
initial investment decisions” can be legitimate expectations for these purposes, and that the FET

standard is breached where a State “frustrates””*' such expectations.
The Claimant lists numerous ways in which its legitimate expectations were allegedly breached:

{a) First, the Claimant submits that the SAT disregarded the Binding Tax Opinions,

“retroactively changing the binding position it had adopted.””"7

(b) Second, the Claimant argues the SAT commenced criminal proceedings without “the

administrative procedure that Guatemalan law requires.”

({c) Third, the Claimant suggests that the Respondent's application for “unsubstantiated”™*
freezing orders during these criminal proceedings similarly constituted a frustration of its

legitimate expectations.

The Claimant disagrees with each of the Respondent’s points against the existence of legitimate
expectations. The Claimant first argues that “it is hard to conceive a more specific commitment
than the Binding Tax Opinions.” According to the Claimant, the SAT itself has expressed the
view that the Binding Tax Opinions “[g]rant legal certainty and tax justice to the taxpayer
specifically with respect to the answer to the concrete case presented and the Tax Administration
cannot deviate in its actions from the criteria set out in the binding opinion.”™* The Claimant
disputes the “suggestion that the Binding Tax Opinions were not valid under its [the

PCA Case No. 2019-43
Award
Page 136 of 195

The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s arguments on the requirement for due diligence as
part of establishing a legitimate expectation are “entirely without merit.”’” The Claimant first
contends that where “a regulatory regime upon which an investor decides to invest is clear on its
face, the investor does not need to demonstrate whether it undertook a sophisticated due diligence
when relying on the continued application of such a regime.””® The Claimant states that it has
met this requirement. The Claimant further disputes that “red flags” were raised: in particular, it
contends that the Respondent’s argument specifically focuses on “the SAT Audit that pre-existed
the issuance of the Binding Tax Opinions”? and that has “no bearing on the validity of the Tax
Opinions.” According to the Claimant, “the objective of a binding tax opinion issued by a
sovereign taxing authority is precisely to ‘address and dispel’ any concerns.””

Finally, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s view that “the application of the Binding Tax
Opinion was not an important factor in IC Power’s decision to invest in the Distributors” The
Claimant submits that this is incorrect, and the Binding Tax Opinions were a key factor: the
Distributors’ “sustainable financial performance” was a major component of the “strategic
rationale” to invest in the Distributors as raised in the presentation to the IC Power Board in
November 2015.”

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent disagrees that the Claimant’s legitimate expectations were violated. Rather, the
Respondent’s view is that the Binding Tax Opinions “could not have provided ground for any
legitimate expectation that the SAT would have authorized the Tax Deductions or that these were
in accordance with the law.”

The Respondent takes issue with the Claimant’s arguments regarding the extent to which the

Binding Tax Opinions create legitimate expectations. The Respondent argues the Claimant

“cannot have had a reasonable expectation under which the Consulting Department would have
authorized the Tax Deductions:””” an investor can only reasonably base their expectations on
representations “attributable to a competent organ or representative of the state,” which, the

Respondent suggests, is not the case here.

Citing Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Respondent
asserts that only expectations arising from specific commitments are protected. The commitment
or guarantee “must be sufficiently specific, i.e., it must be precise as to its content and clear as to
its form.” The Respondent’s view is that the Binding Tax Opinions are not specific enough to

meet this standard: they were “at most, ambiguous” on the availability of the Tax Deductions.”

The Respondent then states that “the investor's expectations must be legitimate and reasonable in
light of the circumstances,”””' and cannot be subjective.” The Respondent argues that this

principle requires that “any expectation by the investor must take into account the entire legal and

 

regulatory k applicable to the i including the ig) hani: of the

State.””3

As such, the Respondent contends that “it was perfectly foreseeable that the SAT would verify
the lawfulness of the Tax Deductions even after the Binding Tax Opinions had been issued.”
The Respondent analogises the case to the decision by the tribunal in Spyridon Roussalis v.
Romania, noting that the Claimant could not have expected authorities to “refrain from resolving
reasonable concerns they might have concerning Claimant’s fulfillment of its tax obligations.”””>

The Respondent particularly emphasises that the Binding Tax Opinions “are not binding in

that “[iJnternational law does not prevent the State from exercising criminal oversight, regardless
of the investor's interpretation as to whether a regulation in domestic law is reasonable.”””*
Further, “[rlegardless of whether the Claimant may have made a reasonable interpretation of the

2779

tax law,”"” the SAT is obliged “to suspend the administrative procedure and file a criminal

complaint.”

The Respondent submits that a further requirement of fair and equitable treatment is that
“investors’ expectations are only legitimate when the investors performed an adequate due
diligence process at the time they made their investment.””*? The Respondent contends that “the
documents of the alleged due diligence were full of red flags as to the illegitimacy of the Tax

29782

Deductions”” and the Claimant “decided to ignore these many red flags.””*? The Respondent

argues that the Claimant “attempts to restrict the scope of the obligation of due diligence under

international law by appealing to a distorted reading of international case law,”

and particularly
notes that it is erroneous to state “that the standard of due diligence applicable to experienced
businessmen, one recognized by numerous ICC awards, has no relevance to investment

arbitration.””*°

Finally, the Respondent asserts that “international law only protects those legitimate expectations

characterises the Claimant’s argument as being that “international law does not require legitimate

According to the Respondent, the case law does not support this. Recalling Técnicas

the Claimant notes that arbitrary conduct is that which is “founded on prejudice or

The Claimant suggests the Respondent uses the Case concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI)
(United States of America v. Italy)”* to set too high a threshold for arbitrariness, explaining that
“the concept of arbitrariness has evolved substantially in investment treaty arbitration since the
1CJ judgment in the ELSI case.”™ The Claimant states that the Respondent has mischaracterised
one part of the Claimant's argument as being that “Guatemala simply misapplied its own laws.”°°
Instead, the Claimant clarifies its position that this case relates to its “undermined”! expectations
based on the Binding Tax Opinions. The Claimant further distinguishes a series of authorities

invoked by the Respondent as follows:

(a) First, the Claimant distinguishes the Respondent's reliance on Cervin Investissements S.A.
& Rhone Investissements S.A. vy. Republic of Costa Rica*” and the view that “a violation
of municipal law does not per se give rise to a violation of international law.”*” According
to the Claimant, the Cervin tribuna! nevertheless recognized that the “unreasonable or

29804

capricious”*™ application of domestic law can still be arbitrary.

{b) Second, the Claimant opposes the Respondent’s reliance on Glencore International A.G.
& CL Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia™ to argue that arbitrariness is more difficult
to satisfy when ining “the isms of State ight.®°S According to the
Claimant, the tribunal was not unanimous on this, and “there are many other cases in which

the mechanisms of State oversight were found to be arbitrary and in breach of the FET

of justice is required for proceedings to be arbitrary.

(©) Similarly, the Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's position, based on EDF Services)
Limited v. Romania,” that court proceedings cannot be arbitrary if they have a “legitimate
purpose”. According to the Claimant, that case centred on whether the relevant government
had “authority” to start proceedings and not on the actual arbitrariness of these

proceedings. *'®

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent submits that the Claimant does not acknowledge “the fact that international law
sets a high threshold for claims on arbitrary conduct.”*!' The Respondent cites the Case
concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. fraly) to state that
arbitrariness requires “a wilful disregard of due process of law.”*!? The Respondent disagrees
with the Claimant’s efforts to narrow the ELS/ hoiding and considers it applicable in “all types of
situations.”*? The Respondent also denies that international Iaw has evolved significantly since
ELSI, The Respondent asserts that “a simple breach of Guatemalan law”®"" js insufficient to
establish arbitrary conduct ~ rather, “[tJhe error of law must be of such a nature as to give rise to
Justified concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome.”*'* Moreover, the Respondent relies
on Glencore for the proposition that “[s]atisfying this standard is even more difficult when the
mechanisms of State oversight are analysed and, particularly the conduct of the domestic courts

of the State receiving the investment.”*"*

(ii) Arbitrary Behaviour by the SAT
The Claimant's Position

The Claimant submits that the SAT acted arbitrarily in pursuing criminal charges against the
Claimant. The Claimant contends that this is “an abuse of public authority”*” which constitutes
arbitrary conduct. Recalling TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC v. Republic of Guatemala,** the
Claimant contends that the Respondent has arbitrarily “overlooked its own rules and regulations
without any basis."*'? The Claimant argues that the Respondent’s commencement of criminal
proceedings against the Distributors represents an arbitrary abuse of power, as the SAT “initiated
criminal court proceedings without having previously determined whether the Distributors had
committed tax fraud or any other criminal offence,”*” in breach of its own rules. The Claimant
considers that the arbitrariness is compounded by the fact that “SAT officials twice recommended
not to pursue such proceedings, precisely given the existence of the Binding Tax Opinions,”*”'
and the fact that the “complaint of July 2016 was legally deficient."*”

The Claimant takes issue with the Respondent's argument that the Claimant “submitted no

39823

evidence to demonstrate that the alleged conduct was to increase tax collection”*** and counters

by arguing that “President Morales sent a clear message that the SAT needed to increase its tax

collections.”*™*

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent submits that the SAT did not act arbitrarily in commencing, or during the course
of, the Criminal Proceeding. The Respondent starts by analogising with The Rompetrol Group

225

NV. v. Romania®™ to argue that “international tribunals de not have competency to verify whether

a State had sufficient reasons to file a criminal proceeding.** As such, the Respondent contends

that it is not “the duty of the Tribunal to establish whether a crime of tax fraud exists... since

 

that task rests solely with the criminal judge.’ Beyond this, the Respondent rejects the

Claimant’s claims regarding the Criminal Proceedings on four further grounds.

First, the Respondent argues that by choosing to bring an investigation on “the crime of tax
fraud” before “the competent judicial authority in criminal matters”,®”? it has demonstrated
clear respect for “the Rule of Law**” and hence there is no arbitrary conduct. The Respondent
relies on Glencore International A.G. & CI. Prodeco S.A, v. Republic of Colombia to contend
that “the fact of filing a legal proceeding does not constitute a violation of FET in the absence of
a refusal of justice.”*”! According to the Respondent, the Claimant “has submitted no evidence
whatsoever to demonstrate that the conduct of the State was the result of a concerted effort by the
administration of President Morales to unjustifiably and maliciously increase tax collection from
the Distributors." The Criminal Proceedings were instituted for an “apparent legitimate

purpose”* and so cannot be “classified as arbitrary.”*™

Second, the Respondent submits that it had “sufficient indications to file a Criminal

“855 and that Guatemalan law does not require the SAT “to exhaust the administrative

Complaint,
procedure prior to filing the Criminal Comptaint."** The Respondent contests the Claimant’s
argument that the SAT’s conduct was an abuse of power: “the SAT has the obligation of

the administrative process and i i filing a int for alleged

of tax fraud .. . when the existence of indications of tax fraud is verified."*” According to the

Respondent, for arbitrary conduct to be satisfied, the Claimant would need to prove “that the SAT
deliberately ignored the content of [the Binding Tax Opinions]”*** or that it acted out of
“discretion, prejudice or personal preference.”*?

Third, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant that the Criminal Complaint is “legally
deficient as it did not clearly set out ... the criminal offence of which it accuses the
Distributors.”* The Respondent next objects to the arguments that SAT officials recommended
not to pursue the Criminal Complaint, as well as the point that the Distributors’ rectification
paymenis were accepted by the SAT. The Respondent submits that the advice was received prior

to the Binding Tax Opinions,*'

and in terms of the payments, the Respandent rejects the
implication that accepting these payments implies the SAT “consented to the Tax Deductions.”*”
Lastly, the Respondent disputes the claim that it misled the Distributors during the Criminal

Proceeding in any way."

iii) Arbitrary Behaviour by the Criminal Courts
The Claimant's Position

The Claimant submits that the Criminal Court similarly acted arbitrarily in “disregard[ing] the
Binding Tax Opinions,” noting that “judicial conduct can result in a violation of a BIT."“* The
Claimant identifies the alleged “arbitrary nature and disproportionate impact of the freezing
orders on the Distributors” as a means by which the Criminal Court’s behaviour breached the FET
standard.“* Specifically, the Claimant considers the Court’s measures to be arbitrary “because

they were (a) not justified under the circumstances, given the lack of any imminent and irreparable

The Claimant distinguishes the Respondent’s reliance on Elf Lilly and Company v. Government
of Canada, arguing that the case “did not involve anything like the Binding Tax Opinions, which
gave the investor the assurance of a specific interpretation of Guatemala’s tax laws”*® and further

found that courts can engage in forms of “arbitrary conduct.”™

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent denies that the Criminal Court acted arbitrarily by imposing precautionary
measures. The Respondent reiterates its jurisdictional point that “the Tribunal cannot review the
decisions of the Criminal Court as if it were a court of appeals.”**” The Respondent also argues
the Claimant has mischaracterised Eli Lilly and Company v. Government of Canada; for the

“complied with the requirements set forth in the Civil and Commercial Procedural Code and the
Tax Code.”*° According to the Respondent, “the disregarding of the Binding Opinions by the
Criminal Court cannot per se constitute arbitrary conduct,”** because the Opinions were “not
binding for the Criminal Court.”** Nor, in the Respondent’s view, were the measures

“disproportionate”.** In any event, the Distributors’ choice not to challenge the decision

having done so, the Respondent argues, the Tribunal cannot conclude “that the State acted in an

arbitrary manner in violation of its international obligations.”"**

{c) Denial of Due Process and Procedural Fairness
The Claimant's Position

The Claimant alleges that it was denied procedural fairness by the Respondent in breach of the

FET standard. Drawing on Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States,”

the Claimant
argues that the FET standard requires the Government to abide by “basic principles of procedural
fairness.”* The Claimant’s view is that “the FET standard provides a “basic and general
standard” with respect to the required procedural fairness.”**' The Claimant contends procedural

fairness was breached by both the actions of the SAT and of the Criminal Court.

The Claimant alleges that the SAT “adopted measures against the Distributors that did not respect
basic principles of procedural fairness.”®? Citing Crystallex International Corporation v.
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,** the Claimant argues the applicable standard is whether
parties are “treated non-transparently or inconsistently througheut the process and thereafter.”
In terms of the SAT’s treatment, the Claimant specifically states that “[t]he SAT’s use of criminal
proceedings to put pressure on the Distributors was unlawful and departs from the standard of

procedural fair[ness] that Guatemala is bound to respect under the FET Standard.”** In particular,

the Claimant submits that “[t]he SAT filed the Criminat Complaint against the Distributors

without any evidence of fraud by the Distributors or its empioyees, as legally required.”**

496. The Claimant also secks to categorise the behaviour of the Criminal Court as a breach of the

497.

874

requisite standard of procedural fairness and a breach of due process. Recalling decisions in
Antoine Abou Lahoud & Leila Bounafeh-Abou Lahoud v. Democratic Republic of the Congo
and Deutsche Bank AG v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka* the Claimant argues that
the freeze and intervention orders issued by the court were “not justified under the circumstances,
given the lack of any imminent and irreparable prejudice; and . . . not tailored to allow for the
proper continuity of the companies.”* The Claimant alleges this was done with no consideration
of “the disproportionately adverse effects”*” that the measures would have on the Distributors.
As such, the Claimant concludes that the court’s actions “were not only inconsistent with
Guatemalan law, bul they also did not respect the procedural fairness that the FET standard
requires.”*”! The Claimant particufarly emphasizes that the Court “denied the Distributors access
to the case file, held ex parte hearings to grant provisional measures” and only convened a hearing

regarding the interim measures “almost three months after issuing the Freezing Order.”*”

The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent’s position that due process is limited to the party’s
right to present its case, and to the authority to issue a decision. According to the Claimant, the
Respondent inaccurately takes issue with Claimant’s reliance on Alex Genin, Eastern Credit
Limited, inc. and A.S. Baltoil v. Republic of Estonia for a “basic and general standard” of
procedural fairness.*” The Claimant also argues that the Distributors’ failure to challenge the
Provisional measures “does not render those orders in conformity with international law” as the

Distributors would have faced “dire consequences”’®” if they had not paid.

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent disagrees that the Claimant was denied due process or procedural fairness. With
reference to Glencore International A.G. & C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia,” the
Respondent characterises the right to due process as being “that each party has the opportunity to
present ils case and that the decision of the corresponding judge or administrative entity shall be
reasoned and impartial.”*” The Respondent's position is that to prove a breach of due process
the Claimant must show “manifest and gross failure to comply with the elementary principles of
justice”? The Respondent contends the Claimant’s claims must be limited to the Criminal

Proceedings, and argues that no denial of due process took place.**

The Respondent first submits that the precautionary measures ordered by the Criminal Court
followed “the procedure established for that purpose in Guatemalan legislation.’ The
Respondent specifically relies upon the fact that these orders are “customary” in Guatemala.

Second, the Respondent notes that the Distributors did not “exercise their right to a defense” or
“request a reduction or substitution of the precautionary measures.”"*' The Respondent submits
it is “inconceivable” that the Claimant file for breach of due process without having “ma[de] use
of the tools specifically provided by the State to guarantee the investors fsic] right to due
process."*8? The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's assertion that “SAT officials
indicated that they would not consent to their lifting unless the Distributors paid the full amounts
claimed”,®*° arguing that this does not explain the decision not to file an appeal, and further that
it would be “unreasonable” to expect the SAT to “request the revocation of a precautionary

measure on its own initiative.”**

Third, contrasting the case with Lahoud & Lahoud v. DRC™ and Deutsche Bank y. Sri Lanka,®*
the Respondent submits that the Distributors have had full opportunities to defend themselves

throughout the Criminal Proceeding and hence have not been denied due process.**”

The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s arguments regarding due process. The Respondent first
submits that “infringement of due process”™* requires “serious error,”*° which is not established.
The Respondent next contends that “none of the facts asserted by the Claimant in its Reply

constitute a violation of due process”®*

under the strict standards required. In particular, the
Claimant has not shown “procedural infringements in filing the Criminal Complaint”! by the
SAT. Additionally, the arguments against the ordering of the precautionary measures are not
sufficient as under Guatemalan law “it is usual to order precautionary measures on an ex parte
basis.”*? Finally, the fact that the Distributors “fully exercised their right to a defense in the
course of the Criminal Proceeding”*” helps to establish that the due process requirements were

met.

(qd) Failure to Act Transparently
The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues the Respondent breached the FET standard through a failure to act
transparently. Referencing Técnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. The United Mexican
States," the Claimant notes the expectation that the State will “act in a consistent manner, free

from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor.” The

and Waste

The Claimant considers that the Respondents actions “fell significantly short of the transparency
standard that the FET imposes.”®° In particular, the Claimant identifies two ways in which the

901

Respondent fell short of the transparency requirements. The Claimant first alleges the

Respondent was not transparent in the SAT’s commencement of criminal proceedings, its

applications for “crushing”®” injunctions and the “excessive measures”*"

granted by the
Criminal Court. The Claimant next submits that “high-level SAT officials misled the Distributors
to the effect that the SAT would not initiate a tax audit for 2013-2015” and then, on the same

day, notified the Distributors that this audit was to be conducted.

The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s argument that objections on the basis of transparency
cannot be made unless regulatory change is involved. According to the Claimant, the Respondent
mischaracterises ECE Projektmanagement v. Czech Republic,”* in which the tribunal only notes
that many cases involving transparency have concerned situations in which a law has been
changed. The Claimant also submits the Respondent has not established that it acted

transparently: in particular, the Claimant contends that the reasons for “abandoning the Binding,

The Respondent’s Position

Recalling ECE Projektmanagement v. Czech Republic, the Respondent argues that this
requirement applies only where “the law has been changed to the detriment of the investor

The Respondent further contends that its conduct was nonetheless “completely transparent.”?"?
The Respondent argues the Binding Tax Opinions provided sufficient “warnings”? as to the

arguments “with respect to the of the Tax Deductions”? and additionally

 

“described the reasons why it believed a tax fraud could exist in the Criminal Complaint.”?!* The

Respondent therefore submits that the “claim of lack of transparency must be rejected.”"!?

publish the regulations governing the investment and future changes to these in such a way that

respect to the regulations applicable to tax and criminal oversight.”°"! The Respondent then re-
asserts that “the Claimant has not in any case demonstrated that the conduct of the State has not

been transparent.”°*

2. The Tribunal’s Considerations on FET

At their core, the Claimant’s claims arise from the decision of the SAT to bring criminal
proceedings and submit seizure applications against the Distributors in alleged disallowance of
the Binding Tax Opinions (a), and without exhausting administrative proceedings in accordance
with Guatemalan law (b). A breach of FET is also claimed in connection with the decision of the
Criminal Court to grant the SAT’s seizure applications (c). The Tribunal addresses these maters
seriatim. Lastly, the Tribunal will assess whether the Respondent’s actions amount to a breach
of the FET standard in the Treaty (d).

(a) The Binding Tax Opinions
An analysis of the scope and effects of the Binding Tax Opinions is first in order. The Claimant
contends that the Binding Tax Opinions “expressly confirmed that the Distributors were legally
entitled to interest and goodwill amortization deductions arising from Actis’s 2011 Transaction,”
while their binding nature meant that the Respondent “would honor the commitments set out
therein.”%? Thus, it claims that the Respondent disallowed the Binding Tax Opinions by
commencing “the Criminal Proceeding against the Distributors to force them to pay the very taxes

that the Binding Tax Opinions allowed the Distributors to deduct.”°*

In response, the Respondent submits that the Binding Tax Opinions “did not address the specific

case of the Tax Deductions, but rather an incomplete version of the facts provided by the

Distributors,” and, in any event, the Binding Tax Opinions “made the deduction of any cost or

expense contingent upon being duly documented and generating taxable income.”®"°

512, The Tribunal has carefully considered the events leading to the issuance of the Binding Tax

Opinions and the Parties’ arguments concerning their scope and effects. For the purposes of its
FET analysis, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to first address whether, as a matter of
Guatematan law, the Binding Tax Opinions precluded the SAT from filing a criminal complaint
against the Distributors in respect of the events underlying the 2011 Transaction. In the ‘Tribunal’s

view, the Claimant has failed to establish that such is the case.

513. The Binding Tax Opinions provide, in almost identical terms, and in relevant part, as follows:

That, according to the provisions that regulate the Guatemalan tax system, taxpayers shall
keep accounting records in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles so
that the discounted future dividend method used by the taxpaying entity, [Deocsa], is not
expressly regulated by the tax provisions. However, its use is technically correct within. the
applicable legal framework as analyzed in the section on Legal Analysis. Consequently, the
value of the acquired shares indicated in the query, calculated using the Future Dividend
Discount Model, is the value to be deducted from the Price to determine the amount of

amortizable goodwill according to articles 26 of Decree 2692 of the Congress of the Republic
and amendments (for fiscal years 2011 and 2012), and 33 of Decree 10-2012 of the Congress
of the Republic. B) Regarding the interest resulting from credit acquired by the
aforementioned entity, pursuant to articles 38, letter m) of Decree number 26-92; and 21,
ttumbers 16 and 24 of Decree number 10-2012, both of the Congress of the Republic, and the
limitati lished therein, ils deduction is iate provided that it is supported and
documented according to the section on legal analysis,

Pursuant to Article 102 of the Tax Code, the answer to the query made by the interested party
cannot be resolved, disputed, or appealed in any way and only has a binding effect for the
Tax Administration regarding this specifically consulted case. (Emphasis added)”

514. The Tribunal finds no basis to construe the Binding Tax Opinions as a blanket endorsement of

the legality of the Tax Deductions, as proffered by the Claimant.”® Their terms are much
narrower, In the Tribunal’s view, this is particularly evident from the opinion drawn in connection
with the validity of the deduction for interest payments, which is made dependent on those
payments being “duly supported and documented.” Other conditions for the legality of the Tax

Deductions set out in the opinion, such as the requirement to rely on “Accounting Principles” in
applying the discounted cash flow method,” or the requirement that any deductible income or
expense be used to generate taxable income,” lead to the same conclusion. It follows that, in
preparing the Binding Tax Opinions, the SAT did not conduct a full enquiry in respect of the 2011
Transaction and the Tax Deductions, but rather circumscribed its legal assessment to the limited

factual representations made by the Distributors in the Tax Opinion Requests.

Thus, the better view is that the Binding Tax Opinions did not confirm the legality of an actual
situation of fact, but rather drew legal conclusions from the factuai scenario represented by the
Distributors to the SAT in the Tax Opinion Requests. This conclusion is consistent with Article
102, paragraph 2 of the Tax Code, pursuant to which it was incumbent upon the Distributors to

“formulate in clear and precise terms all of the underlying elements of the case,”**!

meaning that
the SAT did not bear the burden of establishing the truthfulness of the representations made by

the Distributors in the Tax Opinion Requests as if it were conducting a tax audit.°”

Accordingly, while the views expressed in the Binding Tax Opinions clearly have “a binding
effect on the Tax Administration with respect to the conerete case specifically consulted,” the
Tribunal concludes that the Binding Tax Opinions did not preclude the SAT from initiating
criminal proceedings against the Distributors in respect of the events surrounding the 2011
Transaction after it became apparent that the scenario that was represented to the SAT in the Tax
Opinion Requests was more complex in reality—and, in particular, after the SAT detected indicia

of a crime in the tax situation under scrutiny.

Indeed, the Tribunal has found no support in Guatemalan law for the proposition that a binding
tax opinion could preclude the SAT from bringing crimina! charges against a taxpayer. Article

102 of the Tax Code limits the scope and effects of binding tax opinions to questions formulated

“with respect to the application of [the Tax] Code and the tax taws.”°™* As such, the SAT cannot
make binding determinations on matters of criminal law in a binding tax epinion—or, more
precisely, it cannot establish that a taxpayer has not committed the crime of tax fraud. Such a
determination is clearly beyond the realm of tax opinions and within the purview of the

judiciary.**

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to establish that the Binding Tax
Opinions precluded the SAT from pursuing criminal action against the Distributors in respect of

the events underlying the 2011 Transaction.

(b) Requirement to Exhaust Administrative Proceedings

The Tribunal now turns to the Claimant's argument that the SAT commenced criminal
proceedings without “the administrative procedure that Guatemalan law requires?” In
particular, the Claimant asserts that the SAT must exhaust administrative proceedings before
submitting a criminal complaint in order to establish whether there is evidence of a violation of

the Tax Code, determine the amount of any liability and afford due process to the taxpayer.22”

For its part, the Respondent denies that Guatemalan law requires the prior exhaustion of an
administrative or legal procedure for the SAT to file a criminal complaint against a taxpayer. 2*
Rather, it posits that Guatemalan law requires officials to suspend an administrative procedure

and file a criminal complaint whenever they find evidence of a crime.”

The Parties agree that the requirements under which the SAT may bring a criminal complaint
against a taxpayer are set out, first, in Article 70 of the Tax Code, pursuant to which: (i) tax-

related crimes lie within the exclusive competence of criminal courts; and (ii) the SAT has an

obligation “immediately” (inmediatamente) to bring a claim before criminal courts if it

“presumes” (si presume) that a tax-related crime has been committed.”

The Parties also refer extensively to Article 90 of the Tax Code, pursuant to which the SAT (i) is
precluded from sanctioning a taxpayer if it detects “indicia” (éndicios) thal the taxpayer in
question has committed a tax-related crime; (ii) must bring the matter to the attention of the
“competent authority”; and (iii) is precluded from sanctioning a tax payer twice for a single

action.™*

The Claimant’s legal experts, Dr. Donado and Mr. Pérez, are of the view that Articles 70 and 90
of the Tax Code require the SAT to issue a formal tax assessment before initiating criminal
proceedings. According to Mr. Pérez, this is because a “detriment or impairment in tax
collection” is a key element of the definition of the crime of tax fraud set out in Article 358 A of
the Guatemalan Criminai Code, and, as such, the extent of the detriment must be determined
before initiating criminal proceedings.“? In turn, Dr. Donado refers to Article 103 of the Tax

Code, which sets out the definition of a “tax determination,”

and suggests that a joint reading
of Articles 103, 70 and 90 of the Tax Code leads to the conclusion that the Tax Code requires a
formal resolution from the SAT “establish[ing] the alleged tax underpayment” and identifying
“the existence of acts tantamount to the crime of tax fraud” as a precondition for the initiation of

criminal proceedings by the SAT.**

For its part, the Respondent relies, inter alia, on a decision of the Guatemalan Constitutional
Court of 19 January 2010, which, in its view, confirms that Articles 70 and 90 of the Tax Code
do not require that administrative proceedings before the SAT be exhausted, or that the taxpayer
be informed or heard, before bringing a criminal complaint against a taxpayer. In that case, the
SAT conducted an internal assessment of a taxpayer’s fulfilment of its obligations, but did not
communicate the results of its assessment to the taxpayer before bringing criminal charges against
it. The Constitutional Court confirmed that the SAT’s course of conduct did not breach the
taxpayer’s due process rights, noting that the requirement that the SAT yield the investigation of

a potential tax crime to the criminal courts seeks to prevent that a taxpayer be sanctioned twice

for the same ctime, as required by the non bis in idem principle.

In the Tribunal’s view, a joint reading of Articles 70 and 90 of the Tax Code shows that the SAT
has an obligation immediately to initiate criminal proceedings (“deberd denunciar
inmediatamente”) against a taxpayer if, in the course of an investigation concerning that taxpayer
(“si de la investigacién que se realice”), the SAT detects “indicia” (“indicios”) or “presumes the
existence” (“presuma fa existencia”) of a crime. As such, the plain terms of Articles 70 and 90
set oul no explicit preconditions for the SAT to bring a criminal complaint other than the existence
of “indicia” ofa crime. The Tribunal reads the requirement that criminal proceedings be initiated
“immediately” after the “indicia” of a crime are detected as an indication that no further

preconditions are required.

Accordingly, it appears to the Tribunal that the conclusions of Dr. Donado and Mr. Pérez are
inconsistent with the plain terms of Articles 70 and 90 of the Tax Code, which require the SAT
to bring a criminal complaint immediately after it detects “indicia” of a crime, and thus set a much
lower threshold than that suggested by these experts. The opinions of Mr. Pérez and Dr, Donado
would also appear to be inconsistent with the Constitutional Court’s interpretation of Articles 70
and 90 of the Tax Code, which confirms that a failure to present a tax assessment to the taxpayer

before initiating criminal action does not breach due process.™¢

Overall, the Tribunal concludes, as a matter of fact, that the Claimant has failed to establish that
the determination of a tax impairment by way of a formal resolution is a precondition for the SAT

to be able to bring criminal proceedings against a taxpayer under Guatemalan law.

The Claimant raises an additional argument in connection with the element of “simulation” in
Article 358 A of the Criminal Code, pursuant to which the crime of tax fraud is committed by:

---the person who, through misrepresentation, cover-up, manipulation, trickery, or any other
type of deception, leads the Tax Administration to error in the determination or payment of
tax obligations, such that it results in detriment to or underpayment in tax collection, commits
the crime of tax fraud™” (Respondent’s translation)

As stated above, the Claimant’s criminal law expert, Mr. Pérez Trabanino, is of the view that:

Therefore, the elements necessary to allege and prove Tax Fraud according to article 358 A
of the Criminal Code are: (a) simulation, concealment, maneuver, trickery, or any other form
of deception that misleads the Tax Administration, and (b) detriment or impairment in tax
collection.

 

n. If there is no precision with respect to these elements of the alleged crime, the
criminal complaint is insufficient. If, on the contrary. the complaint alleges with precision
the constituent elements of the alleged crime, the Public Prosecutor’s Office (“MP”) may
bring a criminal action.™*
In connection with the element of “simulation” in Article 358 A of the Criminal Code, Mr. Pérez
further notes:
If the SAT believed that the acquisition of the shares and the subsequent mergers of the
companies constituted a simulation in violation of the law, the SAT was obligated to begin
an ordinary proceeding so that a non-criminal court could determine whether the acquisitions
and mergers constituted a simulation.”
The Respondent’s legal expert, Mr. Ange! Menéndez, posits that the Claimant is conflating the
term “simulation” in Article 358 A of the Criminal Code with the “simulation action” of Article
1284 of the Civil Code,°* and refers to another Constitutional Court Judgment, dated 26 April

2018, drawing that same distinction.**"

 

The Tribunal agrees with the R Having reviewed the Constitutional Court jud;

of 26 April 2018 relied upon by Mr. Menéndez, the Tribunal finds that a clear distinction is drawn
between the element of “simulation” in Article 358 A of the Criminal Code and the notion of
“simulation” in Article 1284 of the Civil Code. The judgment also states that there is no need for
a civil judge to establish the existence of a “simulation” for the purposes of Article 358 A of the
Criminal Code,°? meaning that determining that a “simulation” has taken place is not a

precondition for the initiation of criminal proceedings for tax fraud.

Further, the Constitutional Court judgment of 11 July 2013, relied upon by Mr. Pérez, would seem

to be inapposite, as it draws its conclusions not in respect of Article 358 A of the Criminal Code,

but in respect of former Article 16 A of the Guatemalan Tax Code, entitled “Tax simulation”,
which reads:

Tax si tion. The Tax A ion will i the it dj
whenever it is established that the taxpayers, in detriment of the tax collection: a} Conceal
the juridical nature of the declared transaction, giving it the appearance of one of a different
nature; b) Declare or confess falsely what actually did not happen or was convened between
them; or c) Create or transfer rights to intermediate persons, in order to maintain unknown
the real parties in interest. - In such cases. the Tax Administration will carry out the
appropriate adjustments _and_will notify the taxpayer _or responsible persons, without
prejudice of starting criminat actions, whenever applicable.°* (Emphasis added)

The above provision was declared unconstitutional by the Court on the basis that it allowed the

 

SAT within the framework of an administrative procedure, unilaterally to establish the existence
of a tax simulation and order tax adjustments, without granting an opportunity for the taxpayer to
be heard. In particular, the Constitutional Court deemed that:
-Since the person who determines the simulation is also the person who later implements
the tax adjustment, the only explanation found is that the effect of the simulation determined
by the administration, is to tum illusory the taxpayer's right of defence with regard to the
implemented adjustment. It appears that before the indication of having incurred in a
simulated conduct, in accordance with the legal principle of the natural and pre-established
Judge, the accused taxpayer must have the possibility to go before an independent and
impartial third party (such as a judge) to refute, with the pertinent evidence, such
accusation.°
As such, the Constitutional Court’s judgement of 11 July 2013 provides no guidance as to the
requirements that must be fulfilled for the SAT to initiate criminal proceedings. In fact, the text
of former Article 16 A of the Tax Code makes it clear that the tax simulation procedure is
independent of any criminal proceedings that the SAT might initiate —“sin perjuicio de iniciar

las acciones penales, cuando corresponda.”

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to establish that the determination
by a civil judge of the existence of a simulation is a precondition for the SAT to bring criminal

proceedings against a taxpayer under Guatemalan law.

with the events underlying the 2011 Transaction—and, in particular, with the Tax Deductions. In
this section, the Tribunal draws preliminary conclusions in respect of certain key aspects of the
conduct of the Criminal Court that the Tribunal considers to be important for the Claimant’s FET
claim. These conclusions will be taken inte account in the subsequent sections of the Tribunal’s

reasoning in order to make the Tribunal’s final determinations.

In examining the Claimant’s allegations, the Tribunal first examines the granting of seizure orders
on the Distributors’ bank accounts during a hearing held on 29 July 2016. It is uncontroverted
that this hearing was held at the request of the Public Ministry, with the SAT’s support”? and

without the presence of the Distributors,**

who were aware that the hearing would take place, but
did not attend?” (allegedly, at the suggestion of the officials of the SAT during a meeting held on
28 July’, which the Respondent denies). It is equally uncontroverted that ex parte hearings
on precautionary seizures are allowed under the Guatemalan Code of Civil and Commercial
Procedure, and that precautionary seizures are subject to appeal.’ The Parties, however,

disagree as to the precise remedy that is available in these circumstances.”

The Claimant contends that the seizure orders were not in compliance with Article 170 of the Tax
Code and Article 530 of the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure, which require, infer alia,
that preliminary injunctive relief be ordered only if a “risk” is proven, upon a justified fear of

“imminent and irreparable prejudice” and not be “arbitrary.”°° The Claimant also asserts that the

resolved in three working days (Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 104, , Code of Criminal Procedure

seizure orders would have been subject, at least, to an amparo action (Hearing Transcript (English),

attachment measures were “overbroad”, as they effectively targeted every bank account held by

the Distributors.°“ The Respondent disputes these assertions.%

As to the scope of the seizure orders, the Tribunal notes that the court ordered a seizure in the
amount of Q 81,977,584.68 for DEOCSA, and Q 48,520,610.00 for DEORSA,* those being the
exact amounts allegedly defrauded by each company in respect of fiscal years 2011 and 2012 as
set forth in the Criminal Complaint.” In furtherance of the seizure order, the court issued
communications to multiple banks, instructing each of them to withhold the full amount allegedly
defrauded by each of the Distributors.*

While the Distributors did not appeal the Court’s decision granting the precautionary seizures,
they did request a hearing to lift the orders on 3 August 2016. As may be gleaned from the
transcript of the 3 August hearing, counsel for the Distributors stressed the need for a prompt (“/o
antes posible”) lifling of the attachments, failing which the Distributors would cease to operate.2”
Counsel also noted that the Distributors declined to request the lifting of the seizures in respect
of their bank account in Banco Agromercantil de Guatemaia, which could cover the full amount

of the seizure orders.”

At the Distributors’ request, the Criminal Court scheduled a hearing for 28 October 2016—that
is, approximately three months later.” In scheduling the hearing for 28 October 2016, the

Claimant suggests that the judge ignored the Distributors’ plea for an early resolution of their

request,°” but the evidence on record suggests that the choice of date was dictated principally by
the agenda of the Court.°™

According to the Claimant, keeping the seizure orders in place during the three-month delay until
the 28 October hearing would have rendered the Distributors unable to operate.” As a result,
immediately following the 3 August hearing, the Distributors and the SAT reached an in-principle
agreement that the SAT would request the lifting of the seizure orders on condition that the
Distributors would pay the full amounts alleged in the Criminal Complaint, plus interest and
fines.””* On that same day, the SAT, together with the Public Ministry and the Procuraduria
General del Estado, conveyed the understanding reached between the Distributors and the SAT
to the Criminal Court and jointly requested that the 28 October hearing be rescheduled to an
earlier date.” The court then rescheduled the 28 October hearing for 9 August 2016. The
Claimant interprets the Court’s decision to reschedule the hearing as evidence of preferential
treatment to the Guatemalan administration,” but the judge herself noted that an earlier slot could
be found for the mundane reason that the parties had reached an agreement on the lifting of the
order and, as such, the hearing would be shorter than initially expected.°”

During a meeting held in the morning of § August 2016 between representatives of the
Distributors and the SAT, the Distributors offered to pay, in protest, the alleged tax deficiencies
for the years 2011] and 2012 (those being the fiscal years covered by the Criminal Complaint),

plus the alieged tax deficiencies for 2013, 2014 and 2015. The SAT undertook not to oppose
the lifting of the seizure orders on condition that the Distributors paid the alleged tax deficiencies
for years 2011 and 2012, plus interests and fines, but made no requests in respect of tax years
2013-2015.

At the 9 August 2016 hearing, the judge agreed to lift the seizure orders, but gave the Distributors
24 hours to pay the alleged deficiencies for tax years 2011-2012, followed 60 days later by the
Distributors’ payment of interest and fines for those periods. The judge also placed a lien on the
vehicles owned by the Distributors as an alternative warranty and scheduled a further hearing for
3 November 2016, while also rejecting requests to bar the payment of dividends or impose any
lien on the Distributors’ shares. During the hearing, the SAT noted that if the Distributors failed

to abide by the undertakings made, an intervention in receivership could be requested.°**

On 10 August 2016, the attachment orders were lifted." Over the following ten days, the
Distributors made the Payments under Protest in respect of fiscal years 2011-2015. The Payments
under Protest were limited to the alleged tax deficiencies for those years, and did not cover interest

or penalties,

On 9 September 2016, the Distributors requested that the SAT rectify its determinations of the
amount of interest and penalties due for tax years 2011 and 2012 on the grounds that such
determinations had failed to take into account the 2015 Rectification Payments.”° On 12 October

the interest and penalties for tax years 2011 and 2012,” after which the Court set a hearing for
29 December 2016.”

According to the Respondent, the Distributors failed to pay interest and fines in respect of fiscal
years 2011 and 2012 as ordered by the Criminal Court on 9 August 2016.%* On this basis, on
12 December 2016, the SAT, together with the Public Ministry and the Procuraduria, held an ex
parte hearing before the Criminal Court, seeking that the Court appoint receivers to take over the
Distributors. The Court granted the SAT’s request.”

Mr. Albin testifies that “{g]iven the potential damage that an intervention would cause, the
Distributors felt compelled to pay the full amount alleged by the SAT for interest and penalties
for tax years 2011 and 2012."%° On 13 December 2016, the Distributors informed the SAT that
they intended to make payment of the outstanding interest and fine payments, following which
the SAT moved to vacate the Court’s order appointing receivers for the Distributors.”' The

folowing day, the Court vacated its order.”?

Finally, the Tribunal notes that, as to the date of this Award, the Criminal Proceeding is still
ongoing. The amounts transferred by the Distributors to the SAT remain with the Guatemalan

administration,

The Parties disagree as to the recoverability of those amounts. According to the Claimant, even
if the Distributors were to be found not guilty of tax fraud, they would still need to embark on
lengthy administrative proceedings to recover the amounts paid—with an uncertain outcome, as

asserts that the funds could be reimbursed at the order of the Criminal Court if the Distributors
were to be absolved, regardless of the characterization given to those payments by the Criminal
Court.

Having reviewed the evidence before it in connection with the actions of the Criminal Court, the

Tribunal shares the observations that follow.

First, as further explained below, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to re-examine the grounds
on which the Criminai Court issued the 29 July 2016 seizure orders, Inter alia, the Court’s
decision hinged principally on a test of reasonableness in the circumstances, that being a
determination that must not be second-guessed by an investment tribunal absent exceptional
circumstances—especially when the decision is made on an expedited basis. The Tribunal merely
observes that that the orders were issued following a procedure existing in Guatemalan law and

were subject to appeal.

Second, based on the evidence before it, the Tribunal sees no evidence of concerted action as
between the Criminal Court and the SAT with a view to extracting payments from the
Distributors, The Tribunal further observes that no such allegation has been raised by the

Claimant.

Lastly, the Criminal Proceedings are still ongoing. The validity of the Tax Deductions under
Guatemalan law and the impact of the Binding Tax Opinions in this determination is still a
question under scrutiny. Relatedly, both sides agree that there is a possibility that the funds
transferred by the Distributors to the SAT will be returned if the Distributors are absolved by the
Criminal Court—although the Parties disagree, in significant respects, on the time that would be

required to recover the funds and the chances of recoverability.

(d) Did the Respondent Breach the FET Standard in the Treaty?

Having made the above determinations on the facts, the Tribunal must determine whether the

Respondent’s actions amount to a breach of FET under the Treaty.

As summarized above, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has breached several aspects of
the FET standard in Article 2(2) of the Treaty, including the Claimant’s legitimate expectations,

arbitrary conduct, breach of procedural fairness and due process, and lack of transparency. The
Parties agree that the FET standard encompasses all of these aspects, but held diverging views as

to their scope and application in the instant case.

The Tribunal observes that some of the alleged breaches of FET share the same factual predicate,
such that one of the Respondent’s actions is said to breach several aspects of the FET standard.
In turn, different facets of the FET standard overlap in respect of a particular type of conduct.
Bearing in mind these considerations, for the purposes of its FET analysis, the Tribunal considers
it appropriate to examine first the Claimant’s more encompassing allegations of arbitrary conduct,
followed by the Claimant’s assertions of legitimate expectations, breach of procedural fairness

and lack of transparency.

(i) Arbitrary Conduct

The Parties disagree as to the applicable standard for arbitrariness under Article 2(2) of the Treaty.
According to the Respondent, the relevant test is that set out in the Case concerning Elettronica
Sicula S.p.A. (ELSD) (United States of America y. Italy), under which arbitrariness is defined as “a
wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of
juridical propriety.”°* The Claimant considers that this standard “sets too high a threshold” and
asserts, relying infer alia on Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic, that arbitrary conduct is that
which is “founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact.”°

The Tribunal sees no benefit in addressing the divergences between the Parties in respect of the
definition of arbitrariness, which are of little assistance when considered in the abstract in the
present case. While the Tribunal would tend to agree with the Respondent that the definition of
arbitrariness in EZS/ captures the current understanding of arbitrary conduct in international
law,” it is clear fo the Tribunal that conduct “founded on prejudice or preference rather than on
reason or fact” may well overlap with the standard of arbitrariness articulated in ELS7. In any

event, the Tribunal does not consider this distinction to be outcome determinative in this case.

There are, however, other aspects of the notion of arbitrariness that the Tribunal considers
particularly pertinent when addressing the limits of a State’s discretion to pursue criminal action.
First, the Parties agree—and the Tribunal concurs—that a misapplication by the organs of a State
of its own laws does not per se constitute arbitrariness. This was clearly established in ELSP%
and has been confirmed by investment tribunals.” it is equally well established that investment
tribunals owe a high degree of deference to the determinations made by State organs in applying

© and to the decision-making processes of States." The Tribunal remains

domestic law
mindful, however, that “the pursuit of crime ~ or even its mere invocation — cannot serve on its
own as a justification for conduct that breaches the rights of foreign investors under applicable

treaties.” '0

Bearing tn mind these considerations, the Tribunal turns first to analysing the allegedly arbitrary
behaviour of the SAT, which is centred on the filing of the Criminal Complaint in disallowance
of the Binding Tax Opinions (i), without following the procedures established in Guatemalan law
{ii} and following an allegedly flawed decision-making process (iii). The Claimant also asserts
that the SAT improperly exercised pressure on the Distributors within the context of the Criminal

Proceedings to extract payments from them (iv).

First, as the Tribunal understands it, the main factual predicate underlying the Claimant's
arbitrariness claim is that the Binding Tax Opinions confirmed the validity of the Tax Deductions,
such that any [ater behaviour by the SAT that was inconsistent with this determination constitutes
an instance of arbitrariness. Other actions of the SAT, including the closing of the Tax Audit
through the Annulment Resolutions and the acceptance of the Rectification Payments and of the

Distributors’ financial statements for the year 2015, are part of the larger context of the Binding

Tax Opinions and constitute, in the Claimant’s view, representations that are also in contradiction

with the filing of the Criminal Complaint.'°

The Tribunal observes that the Respondent's alleged contradictory behaviour arises foremost as
a matter of Guatemalan Jaw, in that the Binding Tax Opinions were “binding” on the SAT and
were later disallowed. As a general notion, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the
conctusions reached in the Binding Tax Opinions are “binding” on the SAT as per Article 102 of
the Tax Code. The Tribunal nonetheless recalls its above determination that the Claimant has
failed to establish, as a matter of Guatemalan law, that the Binding Tax Opinions precluded the
initiation of criminal action against the Distributors in respect of the 2011 Transaction. Thus, the
submission by the SAT of the Criminal Complaint could not, in and of itself, be characterized as

contradictory with the Binding Tax Opinions.

Having reached this determination, the Tribunal must also conclude that the SAT’s alleged
disallowance of the Annulment Resolutions'°* and the acceptance of the Rectification
Payments' do not constitute arbitrary conduct. In particular, the Tribunal observes that the
Annulment Resolutions nullified certain adjustments concerning the Tax Deductions following
the Tax Audit, but did not confirm their validity. In turn, the Rectification Payments were made
by the Distributors “taking into account” (“fomando en consideracién”) the Binding Tax
Opinions.'°® As such, the Tribunal sees these actions as contextual in respect of the Binding Tax
Opinions and thus of limited significance for the Claimant’s assertions of arbitrariness if
considered on a stand-alone basis. Even if these actions could be said to constitute representations
in contradiction with the initiation of the Criminal! Proceedings, such representations, unlike the
Binding Tax Opinions, are not “binding” on the SAT and cannot form the basis of a claim for

“wilful disregard of due process of law” in this case.

Second, the Claimant considers that the failure by the SAT to determine the existence of a tax
impairment and a tax simulation prior to initiating criminal proceedings constitutes an instance of

arbitrariness. As noted above, the Tribunal has concluded that the factual predicate that would be

necessary to sustain this claim under Guatemalan law has not been established, and thus dismisses

this argument.

Accordingly, the Tribunal considers as moot the Respondent’s argument that the SAT cannot be
liable for acting in accordance with the decisions of Guatemalan domestic courts, which was

raised in connection with these arguments. 7

Third, the Claimant takes issue with the internal decision-making processes within the SAT
leading to the submission of the Criminal Complaint before the Criminal Court, as summarized
in Section IH.E.3 above. In particular, the Claimant alleges that the Criminal Complaint was an
“effort to maximize collections at the expense of the rule of law,” as part of what it alleges was a
larger policy of the SAT.'°* With this alleged intent, the Claimant claims, the SAT “arbitrarily
disregarded multiple SAT acts”"®* when preparing the Criminal Complaint, including the
Binding Tax Opinions, the Rectification Payments and internal reports from various SAT

departments advising against the initiation of criminal proceedings against the Distributors, !°"°

In light of the Tribunal’s above determinations concerning the Binding Tax Opinions and the
SAT’s failure to exhaust administrative proceedings, the residual question that must be addressed
by the Tribunal in connection with the actions of the SAT is whether the submission of the
Criminal Comptaint before the Criminal Court following an allegedly flawed decision-making

process constitutes arbitrary conduct.

In the Tribunal’s view, this question must be answered in the negative. Having carefully
considered the evidence before it, the Tribunal finds that the disagreements that arose within the
SAT when analysing the potential criminal nature of the Tax Deductions are better explained as
part of a deliberative process within the institution than as evidence of arbitrariness. The decision
to file the Criminal Complaint must be understood against the background of the 2011
Transaction, a reverse triangular merger requiring detailed tax structuring'*"' and including key

aspects with no clear precedent in Guatemalan law.'°!? These features of the Transaction, paired

with other circumstances surrounding the preparation of the Binding Tax Opinions (such as the
issuance of the opinions within four days from the filing of the Tax Opinion Requests or the
involvement of several of the authors of the opinions in a corruption scandal)'?" lead to the
conclusion that the filing of the Criminal Complaint admits explanations other than maximizing

tax collection.

In sum, the Tribunal concludes that the SAT’s decision to file the Criminal Complaint did not
constitute arbitrary behaviour under Article 2(2) of the Treaty.

Fourth, within the context of the Criminal Proceedings themselves, the Claimant claims that the
SAT exerted undue pressure on the Disiributors to force them to pay in full the amounts claimed
in the Criminal Complaint for the years 2011 and 2012, as well as amounts allegedly owed with
respect to the tax years 2013-2015.'° The full context of this argument is summarized in

Section III.F above.

Having determined that the decision to file the Criminal Complaint did not constitute arbitrary
conduct, the Tribunal considers that the same conclusion should also apply, in principle, to any
action taken by the SAT within the context of the Criminal Proceedings. There is nothing
improper in the pursuit of interim measures by a State agency following procedures existing in
domestic law. However, as the Tribunal understands the Claimant's argument, it is principally
centred on exchanges taking place in paratiel to the Criminal Proceedings and intended to lead
the Distributors to adopt 4 position that would undermine their criminal defence, as well as to
extract payments from them. In particular, the Claimant offers this recount of events in respect
of the meeting held between representatives of the SAT and the Distributors on 27 July 2016:

Moreover, the SAT repeatedly misled the Distributors about its prosecution of the criminal

case, e.g., by telling them that it would not pursue injunctions, that the Distributors’

representatives needed not attend court hearings, and that the SAT would not seek to expand

the criminal case onto further tax years. All of these statements turned out to be false,

sometimes disproven by a matter of hours. By acting in this manner, the SAT induced the

Distributors to adopt a position that would [undermine] their criminal defense. This behavior
was arbitrary and in bad faith, in violation of the FET standard. '°!>

The Claimant describes a similar meeting occurring on 3 August 2016 as follows:

With these improper injunctions in place, the SAT officials indicated that they would not
consent to their lifting unless the Distributors paid the full amounts claimed in the complaint
(including interests and penalties), as well as amounts allegedly owed with respect to the tax
years 2013-2015, in respect of which the SAT had only recently commenced administrative
proceedings. The SAT’s use of criminal proceedings to put pressure on the Distributors was
unlawful and departs from the standard of procedural [fairness] that Guatemala is bound to
respect under the FET Standard. (emphasis omitted)!°!®
The Respondent denies that the SAT made any of the assertions that the Claimant alleges were
made during the 27 July 2016 meeting.'°” It also qualifies the description of the 3 August 2016
meeting, noting that the SAT only requested payment of the amounts claimed in the Criminal
Complaint (i.e., in respect of tax years 2011 and 2012, plus interest and penalties) as a condition

to agree to the lifting of the scizure orders, '°!8

in respect of the 27 July 2016 meeting, also in light of the differing accounts of the Parties, the
Tribunal determines that the Claimant has failed to establish an intent to mislead on the part of
the SAT. As to the conversations held on 3 August 2016, the Tribunal cannot accept that the
proposals made by the SAT within the context of a negotiation and accepted freely by the
Distributors could somchow constitute arbitrary conduct, untess those proposals were said to be
part of a larger plan executed by the SAT in connivance with the Criminal Court—which is not
alleged at all in this case.

Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the SAT did not engage in arbitrary conduct in breach
of Article 2(2) of the Treaty.

Lastly, aside from the SAT, the Claimant raises allegations of arbitrariness in respect of the actions
of the Criminal Court. While raised in connection with judicial conduct, the Claimant has
clarified that its FET claims do not encompass denial of justice.'*"? The Tribunal has been assisted
by arguments on both sides regarding the question of whether the actions of a court are generally
capable of constituting a breach of FET outside the paradigm of denial of justice. For the reasons
that follow, the Tribunal considers that the actions of the judiciary under scrutiny in this case
cannot give rise to a breach of the Treaty unless characterized as denial of justice, meaning that

the Tribunal does not need to address this question in general terms.

First, the Tribunal recalls that international law accords a high level of deference to the decisions
of domestic courts and does not purport to have investment tribunals act as courts of appeal. This
was established by the tribunal in Robert Azinian et al. v. United Mexican States:
The possibility of holding a State intermationally liable for judicial decisions does not,
however, entitle a claimant to seek international review of the national court decisions as

though the international jurisdiction seised has plenary appellate jurisdiction. This is not true
generally, and it is not true for NAFTA."

Accordingly, i ional law sets a particularly high threshold for the conduct of the judiciary

 

to constitute an international delict, which is sometimes said to overlap with the standard of
arbitrariness set in ELS] (“a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at
least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.”)'"! In defining this threshold, Azinian helpfully
distinguished different instances of denial of justice, noting that it “could be pleaded if the relevant
courts refuse to entertain a suit, if they subject it to undue delay, or if they administer justice in a
seriously inadequate way...There is a fourth type of denial of justice, namely, the clear and
malicious misapplication of the law.”!°*

Aside from the requirement of egregious conduct, the exhaustion of local remedies is also a well-
established predicate of the notion of denial of justice. The raison d'éire of this requirement, as
articulated by the tribunal in Jan de Nui N.V. et al. v. Egypt, is that “the respondent State must be
put in a position to redress the wrongdoings of its judiciary. In other words, it cannot be beld
liable unless ‘the system as a whole has been tested and the initial delict remained uncorrected’.
An exception to this rule may be made when there is no effective remedy or ‘no reasonable
prospect of success. ..”"17

As to the question of whether the actions of the judiciary may constitute a breach of international
law other than through denial of justice, the Tribunal in Efi Lilly v. Canada observed the

-.-it is evident that there are distinctions to be made between conduct that may amount to a
denial (or gross denial) of justice and other conduct that may also be sufficiently egregious
and shocking, such as manifest arbitrariness or blatant unfairness. It is also apparent, in the
Tribunal’s view, that concepts of manifest arbitrariness and blatant unfairness are capable, as
a matter of hypothesis, of attaching to the conduct or decisions of courts. it follows, in the
Tribunal’s view, that a claimed breach of the customary international law minimum standard
of treatment requirement of NAFTA Article 1105(1) may be properly a basis for a claim
under NAFTA Article 1105 notwithstanding that it is not cast in denial of justice terms. As
noted above, the conduct of the judiciary will in principle be attributable to the State by
reference to uncontroversial principles of State responsibility. As a matter of principle,
therefore, having regard to the content of the customary international law minimum standard
of treatment, the Tribunal is unwilling to shut the door to the possibility that judicial conduct
characterized other than as a denial of justice may engage a respondent’s obligations under
NAFTA Article 1105, within the standard articulated in the award in Glamis. The Tribunal
considers that this assessment is consistent with the approach, inter alia, of the NAFTA
Chapter Eleven tribunal in Afondey, with which it is content to agree.'°24
The Tribunal reads the Ei Lilly obiter as contemplating that, under customary international taw,
certain judicial conduct might stil] breach the minimum standard of treatment, even if it does not
fall within the realm of denial of justice. Such conclusion canmot be extended to the FET standard
in the Treaty, which is agreed sets a lower threshold for a violation than the customary minimum.
In any event, the Tribunal notes that the Ei Lilly tribunal itseif was unable to identify any concrete
circumstances that would serve as an example of judicial conduct violating international law
outside the paradigm of denial of justice, thus suggesting that it is a rare occurrence. This Tribunal

agrees with that assessment.

Bearing these considerations in mind, the Tribunal is faced with three instances of judicial conduct
that are claimed to constitute a breach of FET even in the absence of denial of justice: (i) the
decision of the Criminal Courtto grant ex parte the seizure orders requested by the SAT on 29 J uly
2016; (ii) the ex parte appointment of receivers to take over the Distributors on 12 December
2016; and (iii) the decision of the Criminal Court to schedule a hearing to address the Distributors’

request for a lifting of the seizure orders roughly three months thereafter. 95

In respect of the interim measures issued by the Criminal Court (items (i) and (ii) above), the
Claimant asserts that the Court “improperly disregarded the Binding Tax Opinions and issued
arbitrary and disproportionate Provisional Measures against the Distributors.”'* It further

claims that the Court’s measures fell short of the requirements set out in Article 170 of the Tax

Eli Lilly and Company v. Government of Canada, \CSID Case No. UNCT/14/2, Final Award (16 Mar.
2017), para. 223 (Authority RLA-112) (emphasis in original).

Code and Article 530 of the Guatemalan Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure.'” Pleaded
on these terms, the Tribunal sees the Claimant’s characterization of the Court’s interim measures
as alleging a “clear and malicious misapplication of the law” by the judiciary under the standard

of denial of justice articulated in Azinian.

Similarly, with respect to item (iii) above, the Claimant's assertions of arbitrary conduct in
connection with the Criminal Court’s decision on 3 August 2016 to fix a hearing on the request
to lift the seizure orders for 28 October 2016 fall squarely within the paradigm of denial of justice
in Azinian, whether under the heading of administering justice “in a seriously inadequate way” or

the heading of “undue delay”.

As a result, the Tribunal concludes that the decisions of the Criminal Court can only generate
international responsibility under the standard of denial of justice. There is nothing in the
allegations made about the Respondent’s conduct that would fall into the highly exceptional and
likely theoretical category of judicial conduct outside the scope of denial of justice. A different
determination would vest this Tribunal with the authority of an appellate court over decisions that
should be subject to revision by local courts alone. Since the Claimant has opted not to raise a
denial of justice claim in connection with those decisions, the Tribunal cannot entertain the

Claimant’s assertions of arbitrariness in respect of the conduct of the Criminal Court.

While this brings the Tribunal’s analysis of the actions of the Criminal Court to an end, the
Tribunal would recall, in passing, that many of the questions lying at the centre of this dispute
(Le., the validity of the Tax Deductions, the existence of tax fraud or the recoverability of the
funds that were disbursed by the Distributors) are matters currently under examination by the
Criminal Court for which no final determination has been reached. Absent exceptionally
egregious circumstances, the Tribunal would have been most reluctant to interfere with the

Criminal Proceedings in any way.

Based on the above determinations, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s claim that the Respondent

engaged in arbitrary conduct in breach of Article 2(2) of the Treaty.

(ii) Legitimate Expectations

The Claimant asserts that its legitimate expectations when making the investment in 2016 were
breached by the Respondent through the actions of the SAT also in 2016, which, in the Claimant’s

view, were inconsistent with the Binding Tax Opinions issued in 2015. In particular, the
Claimant’s expectations were allegedly breached by the SAT when it (i) requested “allegedly
unpaid taxes, arbitrarily and retroactively changing the binding position that it had adopted on the

lication of the tax deductions”; (ii) “criminal pr against the Distributors
to force them to make the payments (without even conducting the administrative procedure that
Guatemalan law requires)”; and (iii) filed “unsubstantiated freezing order applications, which

were then improperly granted by the Criminal Court.”!%8

The core of the Claimant's argument, as the Tribunal understands it, is that the Binding ‘Tax
Opinions constitute the factual predicate for its asserted legitimate expectations, and that, as a
matter of Guatemalan law, the Opinions confirmed the validity of the Tax Deductions, such that
any later action of the SAT or the Guatemalan judiciary putting into question the validity of the

Tax Deductions constitutes a breach of the Claimant’s legitimate expectations.

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant’s assertion is largely based on the premise that the Binding
Tax Opinions precluded the SAT from bringing criminal proceedings against the Distributors in
tespect of the events underlying the 2011 Transaction. To the extent that such is the case, the
Claimant’s argument on legitimate expectations must be dismissed on the basis of the Tribunal’s
above finding that the Binding Tax Opinions did not bar criminal action against the
Distributors.'°? Whether taken by themselves or in conjunction with other representations made
by the SAT—ie., the Annulment Resolutions'* and the acceptance of the Rectification

Payments '*!

—the Binding Tax Opinions did not constitute a sufficiently specific commitment to
refrain from initiating criminal proceedings. The Binding Tax Opinions therefore do not give rise

to a legitimate expectation that such criminal proceedings would not be initiated.

Other factors supporting the Claimant's alleged expectation that the Tax Deductions were valid
under Guatemalan law include Actis’ due diligence in advance of the 2011 Transaction and the

ion of shares in the Distributors in 2016.'°?

examining the tax implications of the 2011 Transaction cannot amount to a legitimate expectation
1033

worthy of protection under the Treaty.
Finally, the Claimant refers to the Criminal Court’s decision to grant the seizure orders against
the Distributors as a breach of its legitimate expectations. For the reasons set out above, the
Tribunal considers that the actions of the Criminal Court under scrutiny in the instant case could
only amount to a Treaty breach under the paradigm of denial of justice, and, as such the
Claimant’s claims in respect of those actions must fail. In any event, the Tribunal observes that
Article 102 of the Tax Code limits the binding effect of the Binding Tax Opinions to the SAT,'°*
meaning that such effect is not extended to the Criminal Court. As such, the Claimant could
harbour no reasonable expectation that the Binding Tax Opinions could, in and of themselves,
preclude the Court from instating criminal proceedings against the Distributors or ordering

interim measures.

Accordingly, the Tribunai rejects the Claimant’s claim that the Respondent breached its legitimate

expectations under Article 2(2) of the Treaty.

Gii) Due Process

The Claimant’s claim for breach of due process and procedural fairness is centred on three

different aspects of the factual matrix of the case. Each is addressed in turn.

First, the Claimant’s claim for breach of due process concerns principally the actions of the
Criminal Court, including the seizure orders, the appointment of receivers and the scheduling of
ahearing on the Distributors’ request te lift the seizure orders three months thereafter." For the
reasons stated above, the Tribunal must decline to examine this conduct other than under the
standard of denial of justice, which has not been pleaded in the instant case. As a result, the

Tribunal dismisses this argument.

Second, now in reference to the conduct of the SAT, the Claimant refers to a series of procedural

irregularities that it contends were present in the initiation of criminal proceedings against the

Distributors, including the of inistrative proceedings or the

occurring within the SAT when analysing the potential criminal nature of the Tax Deductions. °°

The tribunal in Glencore International A.G. v. Colombia articulated the standard of due process
required in administrative proceedings under the FET paradigm as follows:

- the adjudicator, be it a judge, tribunal member, or administrative authority, must give each

party a fair opportunity to present its case and to marshal appropriate evidence, and then must

assess the submissions and the evidence in a reasoned, even-handed and unbiased

decision. ..'°’ (Emphasis added)
When defined on these terms, it becomes apparent that some of the “procedural irregularities”
alleged by the Claimant are beyond the scope of the standard of due process. Notably, the SAT
did not act as adjudicator during its internal assessment of the potential criminal nature of the Tax
Deductions or at the time of submitting the Criminal Complaint—indeed, it then became a party

in proceedings before a different adjudicator, i.e., the Criminal Court. In such capacity, the SAT

   

was subject to other aspects of the FET standard (such as the prohibition on arbitrariness, as
discussed above), but it was not in a position to afford or deny due process to the Distributors as

if it was an adjudicator.

As to the allegations in respect of the non-exhaustion of administrative proceedings, the Tribunal
has already concluded that it has not been established that Guatemalan law institutes any such
requirement. As such, the factual predicate that would be required to sustain this claim has not
been established, and thus the claim is dismissed by the Tribunal.

Third, the Claimant asserts that the SAT requested the Criminal Court to have the Distributors’
bank accounts frozen, without any justification in doing so and without complying with basic
requirements of procedural faimness.'*® As also noted by the Tribunal in its analysis on
arbitrariness, there is nothing per se improper in the pursuit of interim measures by a State agency
following procedures existing in domestic law. The standard of due process and procedural
fairness is not expansive enough to dictate the strategy of States litigating in local courts against
foreign investors. In any event, as a matter of hypothesis, the sole submission of a request to a

court, even if spurious, would generally have no significance or effect capable of raising to the

level of a Treaty breach unless it was upheld by a local court, in which case it would fall under

the paradigm of denial of justice as discussed above.

As a result, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s claim that the Respondent denied due process and
procedural fairness in breach of Article 2(2) of the Treaty.

fiv) Lack of Transparency

In its of Reply and Resp to Jurisdicti Objecti the Claimant describes its

claim for lack of transparency as follows:

Guatemala’s failure to adhere to...the transparency requirement is twofold. Guatemala
initiated the baseless Criminal Proceeding against the Distributors, departing from its
previous position under Binding Tax Opinions and without explaining to the Distributors the
reasons for disallowing the Deductions that were contemplated under the Binding Tax
Opinions. When the SAT commenced the Criminal Proceeding, it misled the Distributors
about the pursuit of a Freezing Order. Similarly, high-level SAT officials misled the
Distributors to the effect that the SAT would not initiate a tax audit 2013-2015, Hours
later on the same day, the Distributors received a notification of the initiation of an audit for
those fiscal years, Such conduct was below the transparency standard that the Treaty requires
and, like in Waste Management IT, represents a complete “lack of transparency and candour”
from the Guatemalan authorities towards the Distributors.’

  

The Claimant’s assertions on lack of transparency are based on the standard formulated by the
tribunal in Tecmed v. United Mexican States, pursuant to which:
The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity
and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know
beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the
goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its
investment and comply with such regulations.'°
Citing ECE Projecktmanagement v. Czech Republic, the Respondent contends that the standard
of transparency in FET is limited to situations where “the law has been changed to the detriment

of the investor following the making of its Investment.”!™"'

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent. The standard of transparency is not expansive enough
to encompass a disagreement over the scope of a binding tax opinion or representations made

within the context of negotiations occurring in parallel to criminal proceedings.

Therefore, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s claim that the Respondent failed to act transparently
in breach of Article 2(2) of the Treaty,

3. The Tribunal’s Determination on FET

For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s claim that the Respondent failed
to provide fair and equitable treatment in accordance with Article 2(2) of the Treaty.

ARTICLE 2 OF THE TREATY AND OBLIGATION NOT TO IMPAIR BY UNREASONABLE
MEASURES

Article 2(2) of the Treaty provides that:

Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable measures the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of
investors of the other contracting party. !°!2

(a) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Government breached this standard by acting arbitrarily by denying
the Claimant due process and through the SAT’s use of criminal proceedings against the Claimant.
Citing National Grid Ple v. Argentine Republic," the Claimant states that a “measure will be
unreasonable if it is arbitrary.”'* The Claimant contends that the Government’s conduct was
unreasonable in that it caused the Claimant to suffer “a breach of due process and a lack of
procedural fairness.”'“> The Claimant further characterises as unreasonable the Government’s
“complete departure from the SAT’s position in the Binding Tax Opinions.”'° The Claimant

then states that the Government breached this articte both through “unlawfully”'7 commencing

1088 _ as well

criminal proceedings — which it characterises as an “unreasonable abuse of power
as by the way in which it acted during these proceedings. Specifically, the Claimant contends
that the SAT conducted itself “unreasonably” by “making promises or inducing them to adopt a

position that woutd undermine their defense before the Criminal Court.”!“?

The Claimant submits that, contrary to the Respondent’s argument, it is not necessary to show
that these actions are discriminatory. Article 2(2) of the Treaty does not require this. Further, the
Claimant contends that there is no issue in its arguments on impairment and on arbitrariness under
the FET standard overlapping, as “there is an undisputed overlap . . . even if both protections are
enshrined in separate treaty provisions.”'° The Claimant affirms its previous argument that the

measures were, indeed, arbitrary. '°*!

(b) The Respondent's Position

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s arguments on unreasonable measures “are the same
as those used to support their claims with respect to the alleged arbitrariness of the conduct of the
State.” The Respondent contends that to make an argument under Article 2(2) of the Treaty
the Claimant needs to show “discriminatory conduct by the State.”'°* Beyond this, the
Respondent submits they have sufficiently addressed this issue in their argument against any

arbitrariness on the Respondent’s part. '°*

(©) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Determination on Non-Impairment

The Tribunal observes that the Claimant's non-impairment claim is based on the same factual
predicates as its allegations of arbitrariness under the FET standard. It also overlaps with its claim
for arbitrariness as a matter of law, and is premised on that claim succeeding in the first place.

Indeed, the Claimant acknowledges as much in its submissions, noting that “a finding of a breach

of FET due to arbitrariness witl also generally give rise to a breach of the hon-impairment
provision.”

‘The Claimant has also faited to assert that the facts underlying the dispute could give rise to a
breach of the non-impairment obligation even if they did not rise te the level of arbitrariness. In
the circumstances, the Tribunal must dismiss the Claimant’s non-impairment claim for the same

reasons underlying its decision to dismiss the Claimant’s claim for arbitrariness under the FET

standard, as set out above.'°

Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s claim that the Respondent impaired by

unr measures the i use, enjoy or disposal of the

Claimant’s investments in Guatemala in breach of Article 2(2) of the Treaty.

ARTICLE 3 AND THE MFN CLAUSE AND UMBRELLA CLAUSE PROTECTIONS

The Claimant aileges that the Respondent breached umbrella clause protections imported into the
Treaty through the application of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause in Article 3.

Article 3 provides that:

1. Neither Contracting Party shall, in its territory, subject investments or returns of
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, to treatment less favourable
than that which it accords to investments or returns of investments of an investor of
any third state cr, subject to its legislation, to treatment less favourable than that which
it accords to investments or returns of investments of its own investors.

2. Neither Contracting Party shall, in its territory, subject investors of the other
Contracting Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal of their investments, fo treatment less favourable than that which it accords
to investors of any third state or, subject to its legislation, than that which it accords
its own investors.'°7

(a) Applicability of Umbrella Clause Protections
The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that MFN clauses “afford investors ail substantive protection provided in
other treaties.” The Claimant recalls Vladimir Berschader and Moise Berschader v. The Russian

Federation, °®=

arguing that “[mJost tribunals”'®? have agreed the importation of substantive
treaty obligations to be uncontroversial.'° Relying on EDF International S.A, SAUR
International S.A. and Léon Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic, the
Claimant contends that in that case claimants were able to use the relevant MFN clause “to rely
on the umbrella clauses in two other Argentine BITs,”!° and that the £DF tribunal found that to
do otherwise would effectively be “read[ing] the MFN language out of the treaty”! The
Claimant also references Mr. Franck Charles Arif v. Republic of Moldova ‘°™ and submits that
Article 3 of the Treaty is “sufficiently ample to allow the invocation of umbrella clauses in other
treaties.” !°

The Claimant seeks to rely on the umbrella clauses in the following Guatemalan investment
treaties, submitting that each requires that “the State observe commitments entered into with
qualifying investors or their investments, related] to the maintenance and enjoyment of

291086

investments’ and therefore falls within the scope of the Treaty’s MFN clause:

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that no umbrella clause applies. The Respondent’s view is that
“umbrella clauses contained in the BITs with Third-Party Countrics cannot be applied to the

Israeli investors or their investments under the Treaty.”!°”*

The Respondent relies on Hochtief
AG v. Argentine Republic” to argue that the MFN clause is “applicable to the exercise of rights
and duties that are actually secured by the BIT in which the MFN is found.”!" The Respondent’s
view is that the MFN clause cannot be used to include any standards “not originally included in
the treaty, as in the present case.”'"”? The Respondent characterises the Claimant’s position as
being that “new protections can be created that were not originally provided for in the Treaty.”!°"
The Respondent argues that only more beneficial clauses “of the same kind” as those already

contained in the Treaty can be introduced from other bilateral investment treaties. '**!

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant contends that the Respondent’s commitments from the retevant umbrella clauses to

under its laws with regard to Claimant’s investments.”'° The Claimant’s position is that “arbitral
tribunals and commentators interpreting similar treaty wording have affirmed that such broadly

regulatory or administrative acts of a State.” The Claimant cites SGS Société Générale de

Tax Administration”!

and therefore “subject the SAT to the obligation to observe or fulfil what
is expressed in the opinion.” The Claimant argues that the Binding Tax Opinions are founded
on “the Guatemalan constitutional principle of legal security,”"' which “guarantees that people
have the right to know what to expect with regard to legal norms, their interpretation and
application by jurisdictional bodies and other public entities, such as the SAT.”"!°? The Claimant
states that the “binding nature”! of the opinions is intended to demonstrate the Government’s
“specific commitments to respect the opinion and not object or qualify its opinion in the
future.”"""' The Claimant further contends that “the conduct of the Guatemalan state rendered the

Binding Tax Opinions not only non-binding, but effectively worthless,”

The Claimant submits that the obligation was first breached when “the SAT filed a complaint
against the Distributors alleging tax fraud because the Distributors had been taking the goodwill

and interest deductions contemplated in the Binding Opinions.” The Claimant argues

Guatemalan law requires that the Government “respect and maintain”!” these obligations, and
is prevented by the Binding Tax Opinions from “formulating adjustments or modifications on the
specific case consulted.”'°* Second, the Claimant contends that the Government breached its
obligations through “forc[ing} payment of the amounts deducted in conformity with those
Opinions, under the pressure of a series of injunctions." The Claimant’s view is that the
Respondent disobeyed its own laws by opting not to act in accordance with the Binding Tax
Opinions, and hence that through application of the relevant umbrella clauses the Respondent is

in breach of its obligation to the Claimant.

The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent’s position that the Binding Tax Opinions would not
meet the criteria for protection under the relevant umbrella clauses. The Claimant contends that
the Binding Tax Opinions are not a “mere guide” but instead provide that the SAT “can no longer
interpret the rule in any way contrary to the one contained in the decision.”!" The Claimant
endorses the view that the opinions are “precisely the type of commitment that the umbrella

clauses in the referenced treaties seek to protect.”"!!

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent contends that even if the MFN clause allows the umbrella clauses to apply, the
facts do not establish a breach on the Respondent’s part. The Respondent recalls its argument
that “it is not possible to derive a legitimate expectation from the Binding Tax Opinions” and
submits that “much less may these [Opinions] constitute a specific commitment by the State in
favour of the Distributors.”"'®? The Respondent further argues that the Binding Tax Opinions are

intended to “guide taxpayers with respect to a future situation”!'™

and not to “exempt the
inquiring party from timely compliance of [sic] its respective tax obligations.” The

Respondent then submits that the Binding Tax Opinions are in fact not the type of commitment

protected by the umbrella clauses: in part, they are only “an “opinion” on the interpretation of a

tax regulation.”

(©) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Determination on Article 3 and the MFN Clause

and Umbrella Clause Protections
The Tribunat observes that the Claimant's allegations under this heading are based on the factual
premise that the Binding Tax Opinions constituted a commitment on the part of the SAT not to
initiate criminal proceedings against the Distributors in respect of the events underlying the 2011
Transaction. As set out above, the Tribunal has determined that this factual predicate has not

been established.""” Accordingly, the Claimant’s claim under this heading must fail.

In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal observes that it does not need to decide the question of
whether Article 3 of the Treaty allows the importation of umbrella clauses in other investment
treaties signed by Guatemala, or whether those umbrefla clauses may be relied upon by the

Claimant. For reasons of procedural economy, the Tribunal declines to address these matters.
In conclusion, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s claim that the Respondent breached Article 3

of the Treaty.

THE TRIBUNAL’S CONCLUSION ON THE MERITS

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal dismisses the entirety of the Claimant’s claims,

B. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

1. Relevant Legal Provisions

Award
of 195

635. The Treaty contains no provisions on the allocation of the costs of arbitration arising out of a

difference or dispute between an investor and a contracting party. The provisions regarding the

Tribunal’s decision in the matter of costs are therefore to be found in Articles 40 to 42 of the
UNCITRAL Rules, as well as Sections 59 through 65 of the UK 1996 Arbitration Act.

636. Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules defines the “costs of arbitration” as follows:

1. The arbitrat tribunal shail fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems
appropriate, in another decision.

2. The term “costs” includes only:

{a)

The fees of the arbitrai tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and
to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;

(6) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(©) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the
arbitral tribunal;

(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such
expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;

{e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to
the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is
reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and
expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.

3. In retation to interpretation, correction or completion of any award under articles 37

to 39, the arbitral tribunal may charge the costs referred to in paragraphs 2 (b) to (f),
but no additional fees.

637. The principle governing the allocation of the costs of arbitration, according to Article 42
UNCITRAL Rules, is that:

A. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or
parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the
parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the
circumstances of the case.

2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other
award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result
of the decision on allocation of costs.

638. Sections 59 through 65 of the UK 1996 Arbitration Act provide as follows:

Section 59 - Costs of the arbitration.
(1) References in this Part to the costs of the arbitration are to—

{a)
{b)

the arbitrators’ fees and expenses,

the fees and expenses of any arbitral institution concemed, and

(c) the legal or other costs of the parties.

Any such reference includes the costs of or incidental to any proceedings to determine
the amount of the recoverable costs of the arbitration (see section 63).

Section 60 - Agreement to pay costs in any event.

An agreement which has the effect that a party is to pay the whole or part of the costs
of the arbitration in any event is only valid if made after the dispute in question has
arisen.

Section 61 — Award of costs.

ay

(2)

The tribunal may make an award allocating the costs of the arbitration as between the
parties, subject to any agreement of the parties.

Unless the parties otherwise agree, the tribunal shall award costs on the general
principle that costs should follow the event except where it appears to the tribunal that
in the circumstances this is not appropriate in relation to the whole or part of the costs.

Section 62 —Effect of agreement or award about costs.

Unless the parties otherwise agree, any obligation under an agreement between them
as to how the costs of the arbitration are to be borne, or under an award allocating the
costs of the arbitration, extends only to such costs as are recoverable.

Section 63 -The recoverable costs of the arbitration.

a)
2)

The parties are free to agree what costs of the arbitration are recoverable.
If or to the extent there is no such agreement, the following provisions apply.

The tribunal may determine by award the recoverable costs of the arbitration on such
basis as it thinks fit.

If it does so, it shall specify—
(a) the basis on which it has acted, and
(b) the items of recoverable costs and the amount referable to cach.

If the tribunal does not determine the recoverable costs of the arbitration, any party to

the arbitral proccedings may apply to the court (upon notice to the other parties) which

may—

(a) determine the recoverable costs of the arbitration on such basis as it thinks fit,
or

(b) order that they shall be determined by such means and upon such terms as it
may specify.
Unless the tribunal or the court determines otherwise—

{a) _ the recoverable costs of the arbitration shall be determined on the basis that
there shall be allowed a reasonable amount in respect of all costs reasonably
incurred, and

(b} any doubt as to whether costs were reasonably inctwred or were reasonable in
amount shall be resolved in favour of the paying party.

The above provisions have effect subject to section 64 (recoverable fees and expenses
of arbitrators}.

(7) Nothing in this section affects any right of the arbitrators, any expert, legal adviser ot
assessor appointed by the tribunal, or any arbitral institution, to payment of their fees
and expenses.

Section 64— Recoverable fees and expenses of the arbitrators.

(1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the recoverable costs of the arbitration shall
include in respect of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators only such reasonable fees
and expenses as are appropriate in the circumstances,

2) Ifthere is any question as to what reasonable fees and expenses are appropriate in the
circumstances, and the matter is not already before the court on an application under
section 63(4}, the court may on the application of any party (upon notice to the other
parties)—

{@) determine the matter, or

{b) order that it be determined by such means and upon such terms as the court
may specify.
(3) Subsection (1) has effect subject to any order of the court under section 24(4) or
25(3)(b) {order as to entitlement to fees or expenses in case of removal or resignation
of arbitrator).

(4) Nothing in this section affects any right of the arbitrator to payment of his fees and
expenses,

Section 65 — Power to limit recoverable casts.

(1) Untess otherwise agreed by the parties, the tribunal may direct that the recoverable
costs of the arbitration, or of any part of the arbitral proceedings, shal! be limited to a
specified amount,

@) Any direction may be made or varied at any stage, but this must be done sufficiently
in advance of the incurring of costs to which it relates, or the taking of any steps in
the proceedings which may be affected by it, for the limit to be taken into account.

639. Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules no longer makes any distinction in the allocation of the legal
and other costs referred to in Article 40(2)(d)-(e) (hereinafter referred to as “Legal Costs”) and
the other costs of the arbitration referred in Article 40(2)(a)-(c) and (f) (the “Arbitration Costs”).
Nevertheless, insofar as the Parties’ Legal Costs are set out in their submissions on costs and the
final Arbitration Costs are determined by the Tribunal and paid from the deposit established by
the Parties, the Tribunal considers it convenient to quantify them separately, This is also
consistent with the division in the UK 1996 Arbitration Act between Section 59(1)(a) and (b)
{Arbitration Costs) and Section 59(1}(c} (Legal Costs). The Legal Costs and the Arbitration Costs

are collectively hereafter referred to as the “Costs of Arbitration”.

2 Allocation of the Costs of Arbitration

Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules prescribes the principle of “costs follow the event” in
relation to the Costs of Arbitration generally. The Rules anticipate that costs will be borne by the
unsuccessful Party, but that “the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the
parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of
the case.” Section 61(2) of the 1996 UK Arbitration Act is, in substance, identical to Article 42(1)
of the UNCITRAL Rules.

The Tribunal notes that each Party has requested its full costs in the event that it prevails in these
proceedings and that neither Party has requested, or provided justification for, another
apportionment of costs. For its part, the Tribunal considers that the circumstances of the case
justify a departure from the general principle that the costs follow the event. In particular, the
Tribunal observes that the Respondent, while ultimately successful in defeating the Claimant's
claims, raised six jurisdictional objections, which had to be litigated by the Parties and were
ultimately dismissed by the Tribunal. Bearing in mind this consideration, the Tribunal determines
that it would not be appropriate for the Claimant to bear the entirety of the Respondent’s

Arbitration and Legal Costs.

The Tribunal, therefore, determines that the Claimant should bear its own share of the Arbitration
Costs and its own Legal Costs. The Claimant should further bear two thirds of the Respondent’s
share of the Arbitration Costs incurred in these proceedings, as well as two thirds of the
Respondent’s Legal Costs. The Respondent should bear the remainder of its share of the

Arbitration Costs and the remainder of its Legal Costs that are not reimbursed by the Claimant.

3. Reasonableness of Costs

Pursuant to Article 40(2)(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the award of the Legal Costs is contingent

upon the Tribunal first finding that such costs were reasonable.

The Respondent seeks US$ 2,338,823.54 towards its legal fees and expenses. The Tribunal has
reviewed the amounts incurred by the Respondent and considers them to be reasonable in the

circumstances.

4. Quantification of Costs

(a) Arbitration Costs

The Parties deposited with the PCA a total of US$ 780,000 (US$ 390,000 by the Claimant;
US$ 390,000 by the Respondent) to cover the Arbitration Costs.

The fees and expenses in this arbitration of Professor Guido S. Tawit, the arbitrator appointed by
the Claimant, amount respectively to US$ 180,247.50 and US$ 0.

The fees and expenses in this arbitration of Professor Ratil Emilio Vinuesa, the arbitrator
appointed by the Respondent, amount respectively to US$ 131,812.50 and US$ 201.13.

The fees and expenses in this arbitration of Professor Afbert Jan van den Berg, the Presiding
Arbitrator, amount respectively te US$ 178,562.50 and US$ 242.87.

Pursuant to the agreement of the Parties, the International Bureau of the PCA was designated to
act as Registry in this arbitration. The PCA’s fees for registry services in this arbitration amount
to US$ 125,231.06.

Other Tribunal costs in this arbitration, including bank charges, the translation of this Award and
all other expenses relating to the arbitration proceedings, amount to US$ 115,183.20.

Based on the above figures, the Arbitration Costs, comprising the items covered in Articles 40(2)
(a) to (c) of the UNCITRAL Rules, total US$ 731,480.76.

The Parties’ respective portions of these Arbitration Costs, amounting to US$ 365,740.38 for cach
Party, shall be deducted from the deposit. The unexpended balance shall be returned to the Parties

in equal shares.

Following the ‘Tribunal’s finding in paragraph 642 above, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant
shall pay to the Respondent the amount of US$ 243,826.92 (corresponding to two thirds of the

Respondent’s portion of the tribunal fees and costs) as reimbursement for the Arbitration Costs,

(b) Legal Costs

In view of the Tribunal’s findings in paragraph 642 above, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant
shall pay to the Respondent the amount of US$ 1,559,215.69 towards its Legal Costs in these
