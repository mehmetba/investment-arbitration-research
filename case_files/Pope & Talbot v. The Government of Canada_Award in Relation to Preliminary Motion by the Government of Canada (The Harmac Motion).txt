POPE & ‘TALBOT INC
A
THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA
AWARD

TN RELATION TO PRELIMINARY MOTION
BY GOVERNMENT OF CANADA
TO STRUKL PARAGRAPIIS 34 AND 103
OF THE STATEMENT OF CLAIM FROM THE RECORD
(THE “HARMAC MOTION”)

1. Ina Preliminary Motion dated November 12, 1999, Canada requested the ‘Tribunal to
alrike out paragraphs 34 and 103 of the Statement of Claim. laragraph 34 alleges thal, in
addition to lumber mills operuted through its Investment (Pope & Talbot Tid), the
Tnvestor controlled Harmac Pacific Inc. “a publicly traded pulp and paper company that
operates a facility located at Nanaimo, British Columbia.” Paragraph 103 states: “Ihe
decreasing supply of wood chips duc to lost production on the Lritish Columbia coast has
resulled in economic loss for Investor's Investment (sic) in Harmac Pacific Inc., which
Taual purchase increasingly expensive wood chips for its pulp and papor opvration."

2. Canada argued in the first place that these allegations were too unspecific to scrvc as
An adequate basis for a case in relation to Llanmac, In the eccond placc Canada argued
that the Investor had fuiled to meet procedural pre-requisites lo u valid Claim under
NAFTA Articles 1119, 1120 and 1321. In particular, Canada argued that submission of a
waiver by ILarmac was an cescntial pre-condition for a valid claim under NAFTA
Articles 1116 and 1117, and that as Llarmac had filed no waiver in this casc, that was
fatal to the claim under whichever head it purported to be presented,

3. On Novemnber 25, 1999, the Investor replicd to thc Motion and sought to rebut the
argumcants of Canada on cach head.

4. With effect from 31 December 1999, the Investment (Paps & Talhol Td) and Harmac
elTected un amalgamation, approved by the Supreme Court of British Columbia on
December 15, 1999, whereby the two companios were merged into onc. ‘The new
company, which has the name Pope & ‘Talbot Ltd, has taken over the cntire assets and
liabilities aMhoth firmer companies.

5. Qn January 10, 2000, in response fo w request from the Tribunal for xpeci fic
confirmation of the waiver of ccrtain rights, the amalgamated company, Pope & ‘Lalbot
Ltd, executed a document whercby it waived ite right with respect to the business
formerly known as Harmuc Pucitic Ine. to initiate or continue any proceedings beliore any
administrative (ribunal or court relative to the measures of Canada under consideration in
this arbitration. ‘That waiver made specific roforonco to NAL TA Article 1121(1)(b), and

it is a necessary consequence of that reference that the claim advanced concerning
Hanmac is under NAFTA Article 1116 ang not Article 1117.

6, On January 28, 2000 Canada lodged a further document challenging any claim duc to
alleged igiury to Marmac. Without conceding its validity, Canada contended that the
waiver was lime barred by NAFTA Article 1116(2) and thai permitting the waiver to
have reiroaclive [Teel would work a substuntial prejudice on Canada’s interests. The
Tnvestor responded on Fehruary 2, 2000.

7. Article 1116(2) provides that an investor may not make a claim if more than three
years have elapsed from the date on which if first ucquired or should have first acquired,
knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge it has incurred loss or damage as a
cosult. ‘There is no dispute that the Statement of Claim on behulf of the Investor was
presented before the expiry of any possible three-year period.

&. Article 1121 provides that a dixputing investor may not muke claims under Article
1116 unless (a) the investor consents (o arbitration in accordance with the Procedures set
out in NAITI'A Chapter 11 and (b) the investor and (where the claint is for loss or damage
to an interest in an cnterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor
‘owns or controls directly or indirectly) that enterprixe waive their right lo initiate or
continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other
dispute scttloment procedure, any procecdings, save actions for injunctive and similar
relicf,

 

9. The principal additional contention advanced by Canada was that the waiver could
only be eflective ax of its.date January 10, 2000. Therefore, according to Canada, any
claim relating to Marmac has not been submitted within the throc-vear limitation period
set ont in Article 1116. ‘Ihe basis for that contention is thar the waiver is an explicit
precondition to the submission ofa claim and that the date of perfection of the
submission of the Harmuc claim must be considered lo be Januury 10, 2000 at the
carlicst. Canada states: “Wherefore, to fall within the throo- year limitation period for the
making of.a claim, the Investor or the Enterprise must uot havo first acquired, nor should
they have first acquired, knowledge ofan alleged breach and related loss prior t 10
January, 1997. The Softwood Lumber Agreement was signed on May 29, 1996, if took
effect as of April 1, 1996 and the quota allocation methodology was unnounced on
October 31, 1996. It follows that the Investor should have first acquired knowledge of
the alloged breach of Chapter Llcven and lose arising therefore with respect to Llarmac
well belare 1997."

10. In its responre, the Investor points oul that under Article 1116(2) the time limit
requirement relates to the knowledge of the Investor, and not to the knowledge of the
investment. It gocs on 10 suggest that the requiroment of Article 1116(2) docs not relate
to invertments.

11. Canada’s contontion that the Llanmac claim is time barred is in the nature of an
‘affinnative defence, and, a8 such. Canada has the burden of proof of showing factual

predicate to that dofonce. ‘That is, cven if dnc acoopts that the waiver is a precondition to *
a valid claim and that the critical dute is January 10, 2000, it ix for Canada to demonstrte
that the three-year period hud elapsed prior to that date. Canadu’s assertions do nat in the
view of the ‘Iribunal cstablish that critical factor. In the first placc it is now clear that the
claim is one in respect of loss allegedly sustained by the Investor by reason of certain
consequences of the Soflwood umber Quota Regime on its controlled enterprive
Hannac, and if ix not for the loss sustained by Harmac itsell, Before time can begin to

run in terms of NAFTA Article 1116(2) in rexpect ofa claim by an Investor, two matters
tuust have come to its actual, or properly imputed, knowledge knowledge of the breach
and knowledge that it has incurred loss or damage thereby,

12. The slalements by Canada cited in paragraph 9 above go towards demonstrating that
the Investor knew or should have known of the breach of Chapter Liicven alleged by it
before 1997, (itis not, of course, in dispute that the Investor tnadc a timcly claim in
reapect of the breaches alleged by il insolar as other losses il claims.) However, ax
paragraph 103 of the Investor's Statement of Claim puts the matter, the economic loss for
the Investor's investment in Harmuc has been caused by the decreasing supply of wood
chips duc to fost production on the Lritish Columbia coast requiring the purchase of
increasingly cxpensive wood chips for Llarmac’s pulp and paper operation. It is not clear
fo the Tribunal at what stage (his loss of production resulted in a necessity to purchase
expensive wood chips, except that it cun only have arisen at some sluge afer
iniplementation of the Export Control Rogime. ‘Lhe critical requirement is that the loss
has occurred and was known of should have boon known by the Investor, not that it was
or should bave been known that loss could or would occur. Lixamined by that

Canada has nol satisfied the Tribunal that the Investor knaw or ought to have known for
more than three years prior to Junuary 10, 2000 that it had incurred Joss or damage in
respect of its investment in Llanmac.

13. Beyond Canuda‘s failure to establish that (he three-year time period had run, the
Tribunal does not agree that the underlying cluim is perfected only when the waiver ix
subntitted, In this casc, the Statement of Claim refers to the existence of llamas,
describes its relationship with the Lavestor and idcntifics the character of the loss
eustained by the Investor in relation to its investment in Llarmac. As noted, Canada
received the Stalement of Claim before uny possible three-year period could have.
elapsed. The requirement of Article 1116 in this respect is thal a claim may be made by
an Investor on its own behalf where it claims breach by a Party of a rclevant obligation
and that it, the Investor, has incurred loss or damage by reason of or arising out of that
breach. The only further requirement is that the claim muy not be made aller the lapxe of
three years, which ax above stated did not happen in this case.

14. Article 1121 of NAII'A imposes two conditions for the submission of a claim under
Aaticle 1116. ‘The first is that the investor consents to arbitration in accordance with the
procedures set ulin NAFTA. The secund ix the submission of the waiver. Article
1121(3) further provides “A consent and waiver required hy this Article shall be in
writing, shall be delivered to the disputing Party and shall be included in the submission
of a claim to arbitration.”

15. The Investor has drawn the attention ofthe Tribunal to the award on jurixdiction in
the Fthy/ Case and in particular paragraph 90 und 91 where the Tribunal thsre dealt with
a similar issuc, Canada points out that in that casc the claimamt provided its waiver and
consent with the Statement of Claim rather than with the Notice of Arbitration but did so
within the three-year limitation period. In the present case the Investor presented its
consent and waiver with the Notice of Arbitration and the Statement of Claim. Tt was
Harmac’s waiver only that was nol then presented.

16, As noted by the L'shy/ Tribunal, conscnt to arbitration and tho initiation of arbitral
proceedings may be taken as a constructive waiver of the right to initiate other
proceedings, The presence of the waiver requirement in Article 1121 might, therefore, bo
scen as unnecessary, at least as it would apply to the investor the party both issuing the
consent under Article 1121(1Xa) and initiating the procosdings, Llowever, Article

11211 Xb) is something other than a description of what otherwise would be a
constructive waiver, for il tells us what exactly is being waived. ‘The Article 1121(1)(b)
waiver ix nol absolute; il permits the investor to xeek injunctive and stmilar relief [rom
the courts and administrative bodies of the disputing NAII'A Party. ‘Uhe availability of
this type of rclicf from the ‘Lribuual is limited under Asticle 1134, and the limitations on
the waiver appearing in Article 1121(1)(h) must therefore be in recognition of the need fo
Provide investors with xome recourse to judicial or administrative injunctive relic! even
when an afbitration is underway. ‘Thus, the investor's failure to execute an Article
1121(1b) waiver could nor projudice tho disputing Party, that failure could only work to
the investor’s disadvantage. Vicwed in this light, the ‘Iribunal belicvcs that thore would
be no good reuson to make the execution of the investor's waiver a precondition of a
valid cluim for arbitration.

17. ‘This analysis doos not address waiver by the investment, as is also required by Article
1121(1)(), The investment does nol issue a consent to arbitration, indeed, it hax no right
fo the remedies of Chupter 11. Therefore, if might be argued thal the waiver requirement
plays a more important role with respect fo an investuent and that that importance should
be respected by making the waiver a precondition to the validity ofa claim grounded on
injury to the claimant caused by hartn to its investment. ‘Ihe short auswer to such a
contention is that the investment would likely be subject to the same constructive waiver
that would apply to the investor itself, That is, the consent (o and initiation of arbitration
by an investor would likely cause a court to invoke a constructive waiver on its owned or
controlled subsidiary, pacticularly where, as here, the two are hypothetically so close that
damage to one can be quantified ax injury to the other. (OF course, other owners of
non-wholly.owned, non-waiving enterprise might seek relie! for injuries caused to their
interests, but, in thoxe circumstances, the disputing NAFTA Parly would not nonnully be
projudiced by the abscnce of 4 formal waiver bocausc that portion of the investucnt’s
damages subject to arbitration would, for the roasons noted, likely be subject to a
qynutructive waiver.) The provisions of Article 1121(1)(h) relaling to an investments
waiver thus play the same role ux with respect (o investors, Le., they limit what would
othorwiso be a constructive waiver of all rights to recourses before othor tribunals. dor
these reasons, the ‘Lribunal is not willing to attribute such importance to the requircment

for an investment’ s waiver in Article 1121(1\(b) as to make that waiver a precondition 10
the validity of a claim. ‘

18. In any case, there is nothing in Articlo 1121 preventing 2 waiver from having
retroactive effect to validate a claim conuticneed before that date. ‘I'he requirement in
Article 1121(3) that a waiver required by Article 1121 shall be included in the submission
of'a claim fo arbitration does not necessarily entail {hat such a requirement i in u necessary

prerequisite belore u cluim can competently be made. Ruther it is a requirement that
before the ‘Lribunal cntertain the claim the waiver shall have becn ctfocted. ‘hat has now
been done, Canada has sustained no prejudice in this respect. No attempt was made by
Harmac to initiate any proceedings in relation (o the meusure (even assuming that it
would ever huve been competent for it to do so). Tn its argument Canada states
“Llammac’s right to commence prococdings against Canada ifany cxpircd throc ycars
after Canada imposed the measure or measures described in the Statcment of Claim.” In
ferms of Chapter 11 of NAFTA Hurmac, heing a Canadian company, could not at any
time have brought proceedings against Canuda under the arbitration provision. Tit had
any right to tke prcoatings against Canada, (hose rights would have rested upon other
legal foundations, and the threc year tins limit to which Canada reficrs relates only to the
claim in ag arbitration by the Investor, and not to any claim by Llanmac or its successor
the amalgamated Pope & Talbot Td. There ix thus no prejudice in this rexpect to
Canada.

19, ‘The foregoing parts of this award have assumed that the Starcmont of Claim
adequately defined the scope of the dispute and the casc Canada must mect with respect
to Harmag, and to this we now (um.

20, Canada makes the point that paragraphs 34 and 103 of the Statcment of Claim fail to
state whether the investor submits the claim on its own behalf under NAII'A Article
1116 of on behalf of Harmuc under Arficle 1117. Roth the Notice of Arbitration and the
Statement of Claim issued therewith on 25 March 1999 are expressly made under Article
1116. ‘There is no substance in this point.

21. ‘The important point made in this respect by Canada is that the pleadings ought to
define the issues between the parties so as to give the opponent adequate information on
the case il must meet, and to avoid surprise al the hearing. Canada ulleges thal the
references to Llarmac in the Statement of Claim are too vegue. Licaring in mind that this
olaim is ons under NAL‘I'A Artick 116 only, it appears to the ‘Hribunal that the
pleadings are such as to give notice that the Investor ix claiming loss or damage to its
investment in Harmac Ine by reason of the breaches of the several urticles of NAFTA
specified by the Investor, that loss having arisen for the reasons slated in paragraph 103.
{Ut docs not appear to the ‘Icibunal that this pleading is so cxiguously stated iu tho
Statcuiont of Claim that it should be excluded upoa thar basis.

22. The Tribunal uccordingly refunen Canuda’s motion to strike paragraphs 34 and 103 of
the Statgment of Claim at this stage.
