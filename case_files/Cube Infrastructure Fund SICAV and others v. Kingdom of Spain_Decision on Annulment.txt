Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 11 of 169

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This annulment proceeding concerns an application for annulment (the “Application”)
of the Award rendered on 15 July 2019 in the arbitration proceeding between Cube
Infrastructure Fund SICAV and others, and the Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No.
ARB/15/20), (the “Award”). The Award was rendered by a Tribunal composed of
Prof. Vaughan Lowe (President), the Hon. James Spigelman and Prof. Christian

Tomuschat (the “Tribunal’”).

The Award decided on a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Energy Charter
Treaty (“ECT”) and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the
“ICSID Convention”)

The dispute in the original proceeding related to the regulatory measures implemented

by Spain modifying the economic regime for renewable energy investments in Spain.

In the Award, the Tribunal ordered the Kingdom of Spain to pay the Claimants €2.89
million in respect of losses caused to their PV investments and €30.81 million in respect
of losses caused to their hydro investments, together with pre-Award and post-Award

interest and costs to Claimants.

The Applicant in the annulment proceeding and Respondent in the arbitration proceeding

is the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain” or the “Applicant”).

The Respondents in the annulment proceeding and Claimants in the arbitration
proceeding are Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV, Cube Energy S.C.A., and Cube
Infrastructure Managers S.A. (referred to collectively as “Cube”), which are companies
incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg; and Demeter Partners
S.A., and Demeter 2 FPCI (referred to collectively as “Demeter”), which are companies

constituted under the laws of the French Republic. Cube and Demeter are collectively

IL.

referred to as “Cube and Demeter”, “Cube Parties” or the “Respondents.” The

Parties’ representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).
The Applicant and the Respondents are collectively referred to as the “Parties.”

Spain applied for annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1) of the ICSID
Convention, identifying three grounds for annulment: (i) manifest excess of powers
(Article 52(1)(b)); (ii) serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article
52(1)(d)); and (iii) failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e)).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 12 November 2019, ICSID received an application for annulment dated 12
November 2019 from the Kingdom of Spain. The Application also contained a request
pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(1) of
the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID Arbitration
Rules”) for the stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application was decided (the

“Request for Stay”).

The ICSID Secretary-General registered the Application on 18 November 2019 pursuant
to ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(2). On the same date, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration
Rule 54(2), the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the enforcement of the
Award had been provisionally stayed. On 6 December 2019, the Secretary-General
informed the Parties of her intention to propose to the Chairman of the ICSID
Administrative Council the appointment to the ad hoc Committee of
Prof. Dr. Jacomijn van Haersolte-van Hof, a national of the Netherlands, as President of
the ad hoc Committee, Mr. Alvaro Castellanos Howell, a national of Guatemala, and Mr.
Timothy J. Feighery, a national of the United States of America and Ireland. The Parties

were asked to submit any observations by 13 December 2019.

Having not received any observations from the Parties, by letter dated 16 December
2019, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Chairman of the ICSID

Administrative Council would proceed to appoint Prof. Dr. Jacomijn van Haersolte-van

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 13 of 169

Hof, Mr. Alvaro Castellanos Howell, and Mr. Timothy J. Feighery. The ad hoc
Committee (the “Committee”) was constituted on 18 December 2019 in accordance

with ICSID Arbitration Rules 6, 52(2), and 53.

By letter dated 20 December 2019, the Committee informed the Parties of its availability
to hold the First Session and requested that they confer regarding the timetable for the
exchange of written submissions on the Kingdom of Spain’s request for the stay of the

enforcement of the Award.

On 30 December 2019, the Centre transmitted a draft Agenda and a draft Procedural
Order No. | to the Parties in preparation for the first session and invited them to submit
a joint proposal by 13 January 2020, advising the Committee of their points of agreement

and/or their respective positions where they did not reach an agreement.

On 7 January 2020, the Parties informed the Centre of their agreement on the modality
and date for the First Session as well as the timetable for the exchange of written
submissions on the stay of enforcement of the Award. The Committee confirmed this

agreement by letter of the same date.

The Parties also requested, on 7 January 2020 an extension until 17 January 2020 to
submit their proposals for the draft agenda and Procedural Order No. 1. The Committee

granted the extension by email of the same date.

On 9 January 2020, Spain filed its Submission in Support of the Continuation of the Stay
of Enforcement of the Award, together with Annexes 1, 2, and 27 to 36 (the “Submission

on Stay of Enforcement’).

On 17 January 2020, the Parties transmitted their agreed joint draft Procedural Order
No. 1.

On 22 January 2020, the Committee held the first session by telephone conference and
issued Procedural Order No. 1 concerning procedural matters along with a procedural

calendar.

On 23 January 2020, the Respondents filed their Opposition to Spain’s Request for
Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, together with Legal Authorities

CL-158, and CL-171 to CL-209 (the “Response on Stay of Enforcement’).

By letter of 24 January 2020, the Committee confirmed the dates for the Hearing on

Annulment.

On 6 February 2020, Spain filed its Reply in Support of the Continuation of the Stay of
Enforcement of the Award, together with Annexes 37 to 53 (the “Reply on Stay of

Enforcement”).

On 24 February 2020, the European Commission (“EC”) submitted with the ICSID
Secretariat an Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party dated 21

February 2020 pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).

On 26 February 2020, the Committee invited the Parties to submit their comments on

the EC’s Application by 4 March 2020.

On 28 February 2020, the Respondents filed their Rejoinder to Spain’s Reply in Support
of the Continuation of Stay of Enforcement of the Award, together with Legal

Authorities CL-210 to CL-214 (the “Rejoinder on Stay of Enforcement”).

Pursuant to the Committee’s instructions, Spain submitted their observations on the EC’s
Application on 4 March 2020, together with Annex 54 and the Respondents submitted
their observations together with Exhibits C-326 to C-328 and Legal Authorities CL-215
to CL-256.

On 5 March 2020, pursuant to the procedural calendar, the Committee informed the

Parties that a Hearing on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award was not necessary.

On 6 March 2020, the Committee invited the Parties to submit any observations they
might have on the opposing party’s observations by 16 March 2020. The Parties
submitted their further observations by that date. Spain submitted its further observations
along with Annexes 55 to 62 and the Respondents submitted their further observations
along with Exhibits C-329 to C-334 and Legal Authorities CL-257 to CL-261.

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 15 of 169

By letter of 23 March 2020, Spain informed the Tribunal that the Spanish government
had declared a “state of alarm, first degree of the state of emergency pursuant to Article
116 of the Spanish Constitution” due to the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic and
“considered it necessary to inform the Committee of this most serious situation,” hoping
it would not affect the deadline for its submission of its Memorial on Annulment. The
Committee acknowledged Spain’s letter and informed the Parties that it would “proceed
as scheduled, and should one or both Parties wish to raise specific concerns we will of

course deal with those.”

After reviewing the Parties’ submissions, the Committee issued its Decision on the
European Commission’s Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party

on 2 April 2020, denying the EC’s Application.

On 17 April 2020, the Committee issued its decision on the Continuation of the
Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award. The Committee decided that the stay of
enforcement of the Award should not be continued and that it reserved the issue of costs

on this request to a further order or decision.

On 29 June 2020, Spain requested, with Respondents’ agreement, a one week extension
for the submission of its Memorial on Annulment from 1 July 2020 to 8 July 2020. The

Committee confirmed the extension on the same date.

On 8 July 2020, Spain filed its Memorial on Annulment (“Mem.”), along with the Expert
Report of Prof. Ricardo Gosalbo Bono with Exhibits 2 to 18, Exhibits R-0003, R-0037,

SUMMARY OF RELEVANT FACTS

The Applicant provided a summary of the relevant facts of the case in the underlying
arbitration which is recounted below.! Cube and Demeter note that the summary of facts
as presented by Applicant is not complete and that a more thorough and reliable

description can be found in the Decision.”

The production of electricity from renewable sources is a highly regulated industry in
Spain. When regulating the electricity sector, in addition to complying with binding
international targets, including those of the European Union (“EU”), Spain submits that

it also had to comply with State aid rules imposed by the EU.

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 21 of 169

62. In November 1997, the Spanish Parliament approved the Electricity Sector Law 54/1997
(“Law 54/1997”) that regulates the electricity sector. The Law 54/1997 distinguished
between the “Ordinary Scheme” which was applicable to producers of conventional
energy, and the “Special Scheme” for renewable energy producers. The intent of the
dual system was to promote the production of renewable energy which “required public
support because the price of energy in the ordinary market was not sufficient to cover
the costs of building and operating the special installations needed...”? and consequently

met the required objectives of the EU.

63. The objective of Law 54/1997 was to provide a “reasonable rate of return with reference
to the cost of money on the capital market for renewable energy producers.”* The
Applicant submitted that “the concept of reasonable return implies that subsidies paid
by the Government to renewable energy producers would enable them to cover capital
costs (capex) and operating costs (opex) and to obtain a return that is neither too high
nor too low.”> The reasonableness was to be measured in light of the principles of Law
54/1997 and the economic and self-sufficiency of the Spanish electricity system.° The
Applicant also notes that the 1997 Special Regime had two phases, the first phase was
to identify the standard cost of the standard investment (capex) and the operation and
maintenance costs (opex) done by a diligent investor and the second phase was to set a

balanced and proportionate, i.e. reasonable target return.”

64. The reasonable rate of return was not quantified in the Law 54/1997 but was left to

hierarchically lower legislation, such as regulations or royal decrees, to develop and

remuneration system for electrical energy production facilities under the special regime shall be supplemented by the
receipt of a premium, under the terms established by regulation, in the following cases: .... In determining the
premiums, account shall be taken of the level of voltage at which the energy is delivered to the grid, the effective
contribution to environmental improvement, primary energy savings and energy efficiency, the production of
economically justifiable useful heat and the investment costs incurred, with a view to achieving reasonable rates of
return in relation to the cost of money on the capital market”). (In the original Spanish text, the sentence is exactly
written as follows: “conseguir unas tasas de rentabilidad razonables con referencia al coste del dinero en el mercado
de capitales”.)

implement the objectives.* This would allow modifications on the basis of the necessary
adjustments to adapt to changes in the economic, technological and other market factors

and to balance the various objectives and interests at stake.”

65. The first regulation was Royal Decree 2818/1998 creating the special regime where
renewable energy producers could choose to sell electricity at a fixed rate per kWh or at
the free market price.!? This Royal Decree was repealed and in 2004 Royal Decree
436/2004 (“RD 436/2004”) was enacted replacing the remuneration mechanisms with

an average reference rate. !!

66. In 2007, Spain approved Royal Decree 661/2007 (“RD 661/2007”) which repealed RD
436/2004 and “replaced the average reference tariff with specific values for premiums
and tariffs, expressed in eurocents per kWh.”!? Spain describes the contents of RD
661/2007 as follows: (i) contained the option for some technologies to choose between
two different rates, a fixed tariff per unit of output or a premium over the market price
for each unit of output; (ii) maximum and minimum payment limits for premium; (iii)
rates based on production of entire facility; (iv) allow use of natural gas by renewable
energy producers; (v) priority access and dispatch to and from the national grid, and (vi)

principle of ensuring a reasonable rate of return for renewable energy producers. !

67. In 2008, at the time of the financial crisis, the Spanish government began to consider
measures to reduce an increasing tariff deficit and limit access to RD 661/2007. In April
2009, Spain enacted Royal Decree Law 6/2009 introducing the pre-registration process
for projects potentially eligible under the RD 661/2007 regime. Plants which were not
completed within three years would not be eligible for the RD 661/2007 regime. '*

In 2010, Spain enacted Royal Decree 1565/2010 (“RD 1565/2010”) which eliminated
fixed tariffs for photovoltaic plants after year 25.'5 Spain then enacted Royal Decree
1614/2010 which, among other things, “limited the number of hours of operation of solar
thermal and wind power plants entitled to a premium and eliminated the premium option
during the first year of operation of solar thermal facilities.”'® That same year, Spain
enacted Royal Decree Law 14/2010 extending the obligation to pay a toll for

transmission and distribution networks to all electricity producers. !”

In 2012, the Spanish government requested the National Energy Commission (“CNE”)
to prepare a report for possible reforms in the energy sector. After a consultation process,
the CNE issued a report with recommendations to reduce the tariff deficit and rebalance
the Spanish electricity system. Spain then implemented a series of measures related to

the production, transport and distribution of energy affecting all producers. '*

Law 15/2012 (i) imposed a 7% tax on income from energy generated by all electricity
producers and fed into the grid; and (ii) imposed a hydroelectric charge with respect to

the use and exploitation of inland waters in the case of hydroelectric installations. '”

On 1 February 2013, Spain enacted Royal Decree Law 2/2013 (“RDL 2/2013”) which
(i) instituted the corrected Consumer Price Index as a measure to update the inflation
adjustments for tariffs; and (ii) eliminated the premium option for the Special Regime.?°
On 12 July 2013, Spain enacted Royal Decree Law 9/2013 (““RDL 9/2013”) which
provided a specific remuneration on market price based on the costs per unit of installed
energy plus standard amounts of operating costs for various types and outputs of

renewable energy installations.”!

72. On 26 December 2013, Spain enacted Law 24/2013 which replaced Law 54/1997 but

was still based on the same principles, including the principle of reasonable return.”

73. On 10 June 2014, Spain enacted Royal Decree 413/2014 (“RD 413/2014”) which
defined the remuneration of renewable energy producers under RDL 9/2013 providing a
reasonable rate calculated on the basis of an “efficient plant.”*> On 16 June 2014, the
Ministerial Order IET/045/2014 (“Ministerial Order”) was issued to implement RDL
9/2013, Law 24/2013 and RD 413/2014, and setting specific economic parameters to

calculate the remuneration of renewable energy producers.

74. The Applicant describes that the principle of reasonable return as well as priority access
to the electricity transmission and distribution networks to and from the grid were
recognized and maintained in RDL 9/2013, Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014 and the
Ministerial Order.** The Applicant submits that the regulatory measures approved
between December 2012 and June 2014 continued with the essential characteristics of
the system and subsidies offered to the renewable energy producers as established in
1997. The Spanish regulator updated the system considering the economic,
technological and market changes as well as trying to reduce the tariff deficit and
rebalance the Spanish electricity system. According to the Applicant, such measures
were “justified by the critical macroeconomic situation in Spain and by fulfilment of its

obligations as a member of the European Union.”

IV. SCOPE OF ANNULMENT

75. Spain requests the annulment of the Award on the following grounds referred to in

Article 52(1)(b), (d) and (e) of the ICSID Convention:

b) The Tribunal failed to express its reasons; and

c) There has been a serious departure from fundamental rule of procedure.

A. THE APPLICANT’S ARGUMENTS

76. The Applicant addressed the objections from the Respondents regarding the scope of the
annulment. During the Hearing, Spain referred to the 2016 ICSID Updated Background

Paper on Annulment” and addressed the principles that apply in relation to annulment.

77. First, Spain acknowledges that annulment under the ICSID Convention is an exceptional
and narrowly circumscribed remedy and not an appeal.?’ Spain points out that it has

“specifically raised the grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention and

notes that it has limited its arguments to those grounds.”?*

78. Second, Spain notes that there is no presumption either in favor or against annulment

that would cause Article 52 of the ICSID Convention to be interpreted extensively or

9

restrictively.2? However, the Applicant submits that if the scope of annulment is

interpreted as narrowly as Cube and Demeter argue it should be, annulment committees

would be deprived of all their powers.*°

exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy and the role of the ad hoc Committee is limited. Bearing in mind the
narrow scope of the annulment proceedings, the Kingdom of Spain has limited its written submissions and expert
reports to those procedural and substantive breaches which fall within the specific scope of Article 52 of the ICSID
Convention. As the Committee can easily verify, all the grounds for annulment raised by the Kingdom of Spain are
included within the motives listed in such Article 52.).

Third, Spain recalls that under the ICSID Convention, annulment is the last remedy to
ensure the integrity of the arbitral proceeding,*! and that the legitimacy of the award is
not undermined.*? The Applicant submits that the Committee is the ultimate guarantor

or guardian of the legitimacy of ICSID arbitrations. **

The Applicant also points to the awards that have been issued in the cases of Eiser,
Novenergia, Masdar and Antin which were decided close in time and addressed issues
that are also raised in the present annulment.** The Applicant has explained that the fact
that it has requested the annulment in other arbitration proceedings is because there is a
common ground at issue in all ECT cases against Spain which concern legal issues

relating to EU law, both on jurisdiction and the merits.*°

Therefore, the Applicant
concludes, it is logical that Spain is seeking annulment in all of these proceedings.
According to the Applicant, the present annulment is vital for the entire “Spanish Saga”

in view of the status of the aforementioned cases. *°

To date, the Applicant recalls that one of the annulments has been resolved and resulted
in the annulment of the award, Eiser.*7 According to the Applicant, “this proves that
Spain’s requests for annulment are not frivolous, unfounded, and that we understand the

scope of annulment proceedings.”>*

Spain, as well as the ECT’s position in the context of international law, and how the ECT

will exist within the EU.”

THE RESPONDENTS’ ARGUMENTS

Cube and Demeter argue that ICSID annulment committees have limited jurisdiction and
are prohibited from functioning as courts of appeal and stress that annulment is an
extraordinary and narrowly circumscribed remedy.*° According to Cube and Demeter,
annulment committees are limited to “serving as guardians of procedural uniformity and
propriety and of due process” and “do not have jurisdiction to review the substantive

factual or legal conclusions of ICSID awards.””*!

In support of the argument that the annulment is not an appeal, Cube and Demeter cite
the former Secretary-General, Ibrahim F.I. Shihata when he addressed the
Administrative Council. Shihata emphasized the exceptional nature of the annulment
mechanism and the history of the Convention which showed that the intent was to “(i)
assure the finality of ICSID awards; (ii) distinguish carefully an annulment proceeding
from an appeal; and (iii) construe narrowly the ground for annulment, so that this

procedure remained exceptional.”

Cube and Demeter submit that the travaux préparatoires of the Convention, the text, and
the object and purpose of both Articles 52 and 53 confirm that the grounds for annulment
provided in the ICSID Convention are narrow and limited and that a substantive, or

appellate review of awards, is foreclosed.**

Cube and Demeter draw from what they refer as the “generations of annulment
decisions” to show how annulment has “found a correct balance” and “recent generations

of annulment decisions have shown unwillingness to overstep the boundaries prescribed

+ “Ad hoc Committees should exercise their discretion not to defeat the
object and purpose of the remedy or erode the binding force and finality of
awards.”””

87. Cube and Demeter note that Spain has serially violated the principles noted above and
has sought annulment in every award rendered.** Cube and Demeter submit that it

cannot be the case that all awards finding Spain liable are flawed in a way to merit their

5!

annulment Furthermore, not only is Spain effectively attempting to appeal

unsuccessful claims, which is impermissible in itself, but it is effectively requesting a

retrial.

88. Cube and Demeter argue that Spain is seeking to use the annulment process as a basis to
introduce new arguments and new evidence.*? They request the Committee, as other
committees have confirmed, not to allow Spain to relitigate its case and to “restrict itself

to a review of the underlying Award and the process followed by the original Tribunal,

which necessarily entails limiting its review to the record before the original Tribunal.”**

In support of this argument, Cube and Demeter point to the committee’s decision in Von
Pezold confirming that the ICSID annulment proceeding is not a “retrial” and
“accordingly, it is based on the record before the tribunal.”°> In particular, Cube and
Demeter argue that Spain submitted an expert report on EU law with its Memorial on

Annulment, while it never submitted one in the arbitration in support of the same of EU

Spain’s new evidence, disregard its attempt to replead its case, and strike the legal

opinion of Professor Gosalbo.”*”

Cube and Demeter submit that since annulment committees are not appellate bodies, it
follows that annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision and ad hoc
committees cannot substitute tribunal decisions on the merits for their own. As the
committee in Adem Dogan considered, it is not within an ad hoc committee’s remit to
re-examine the facts of the case to determine whether a tribunal erred in appreciating or

evaluating the available evidence. Otherwise, it would act as an appellate body.>*

Moreover, in this context, Cube and Demeter submit that it is not for an annulment
committee to consider or apply new facts that Spain could have raised before the
arbitration tribunal in accordance with the revision mechanism contained in Article

51(3).?

Finally, Cube and Demeter submit that as many annulment decisions have held,

annulment is discretionary even when an annullable error is found to exist.

THE COMMITTEE’S ANALYSIS

Before addressing the specific annulment grounds invoked by Applicant and the scope
of these individual grounds, the Committee will set out the basic framework of this
Application, which both Parties have addressed, albeit in different level of detail. The
Committee agrees with the Parties that a fundamental goal of the ICSID Convention is
to assure the finality of awards and to provide limited exceptions to the concept of finality
in the interest of fundamental procedural integrity. The Committee also agrees with the

position presented by both Parties that annulment is an exceptional and narrowly

circumscribed remedy and that annulment proceedings cannot be equated with appeal

proceedings.

The Committee agrees with the Applicant that there is no presumption either in favor of
or against annulment and there is no basis for either an extensive or restrictive
interpretation of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.®! Here again, the starting point of

the annulment process is the finality of awards.

The scope of review, regardless of the specific annulment ground, is particularly relevant
insofar as an applicant invokes new facts and/or evidence in support of its request for

annulment.

In principle, the Committee agrees with the position set out by Cube and Demeter, by
reference to the decision in Von Pezold, that a committee is to “restrict itself to a review
of the underlying Award and the process followed by the original Tribunal, which

necessarily entails limiting its review to the record before the original Tribunal.”

In the present case, the Committee will first address the new expert evidence presented
by Spain. The Committee recalls that despite this starting point, Section 15.2 of
Procedural Order No. 1, which was agreed by the Parties and based on a draft prepared
by the Parties, explicitly addresses the eventuality of the submission of new legal expert
reports. In its letter of 15 February 2021, the Committee therefore decided not to strike
from the record the Expert Reports of Professor Ricardo Gosalbo Bono. At the same
time, the Committee underlined that the fact the Expert Reports were not stricken from
the record did not imply a decision on the probative value to be attributed to the contents
of these reports. Rather, it considered that it remained for the Parties to address the
significance, relevance and weight of these expert reports at the oral hearing in March,

mindful in particular of the context of these annulment proceedings.

At the Hearing, and notwithstanding the Committee’s invitation to do so, the Parties did
not address this issue further. Consequently, while the Committee may return to this
issue in the context of specific arguments made by the Parties, it will do so on the basis

of the principles set out above and confirmed in the Von Pezold annulment decision.

Similarly, and generally, insofar as either Party has relied on new arguments and/or new
legal developments that have taken place since the date of the Award in the underlying
arbitration, the Committee will in principle, with the obvious exception of arguments
and authorities addressing the scope of annulment, refrain from relying on subsequent
developments and arguments, in relation thereto or otherwise. Doing so would fly in the
face of the limited scope of these annulment proceedings, as understood and accepted by

both Parties, and the commensurate, limited, role of an annulment committee.

MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS

THE APPLICANT’S ARGUMENTS

Spain argues that the Award must be annulled because the Tribunal clearly exceeded its
powers. In particular, Spain claims that the excess is manifested in two ways: (i) by going
beyond its jurisdiction in contravention of EU law; and (ii) by omitting the rules

applicable to the disputes and, in particular, by not applying EU law.

(1) Applicable Legal Standard

Spain explains that a manifest excess of power may exist where a tribunal does not apply
the appropriate law or where a tribunal exceeds its jurisdiction or does not have
jurisdiction or the tribunal rules on matters not raised by the Parties.“ According to

Spain, “the failure to apply the law in force occurs when the Tribunal disregards the

applicable law, or its misinterpretation or misapplication of the law is ‘so gross or

egregious as substantially to amount to failure to apply the proper law.’”®

101. Spain notes that committees have annulled an award under circumstances in which there
is misapplication of the law amounting to a manifest excess of powers.® Spain also
argues that “... even in cases where a Tribunal correctly states the applicable law, a
manifest excess of powers may still exist if a review of the arbitral decision makes it

clear that the Tribunal did not effectively apply the principles it had recognized.”®”

102. In response to Cube and Demeter’s argument with respect to the “manifest” requirement,
Spain responds by highlighting that “an extensive argumentation and analysis do not
exclude the possibility of concluding that there is a manifest excess of power, as long as
it is sufficiently clear and serious.”°* Spain adds that a tribunal may manifestly exceed
its powers, for the purpose of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, if it does not
apply the appropriate law. °°

103. Spain objects to Cube and Demeter’s view of the term “manifest” in Article 52 and
argues that they have “decontextualized quotes from some annulment decision[s].””° On
this point, Spain argues that this term must follow the interpretation in accordance with
Article 31 of the VCLT.’”! Spain argues that the three authentic versions in English,

French and Spanish of the ICSID Convention can be analyzed to this end.

104. As to the Spanish version, it states “gue el tribunal se hubiera extralimitado
manifiestamente en sus facultades.” The Applicant refers to the Dictionary of the Royal
Spanish Academy of the Spanish language and points that “manifestly” means “in a
manifest manner” and takes the first meaning given to “manifestly” which is
“discovered.” The Applicant concludes on the basis of this interpretation that if an
excess of powers is discovered, the award must be annulled.” As to the French version,
which reads “excés de pouvoir manifeste du Tribunal” the Applicant refers to the
Larousse dictionary which defines “manifeste” as “[d]ont la nature, la réalité,
l'authenticité s'imposent avec evidence.” The Applicant concludes on this basis that “if
it becomes evident that there is an over-riding of powers, the [ICSID] Convention
imposes the annulment of the Award.” Finally, in relation to the English version which
reads “that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers,” the Applicant refers to the
Oxford dictionary which defines “manifest” as “easy to see or understand.” In this
regard, the Applicant concludes that “an exceeding of powers that is easy to see or
understand should determine the annulment of the award.”’+ Consequently, Spain
argues that in this case it is easy to see that the “overreaching of powers is evident and

is easily appreciated in view of the information available in the file.””°

The Applicant states that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the present case and
that the lack of jurisdiction arises from the application of EU law. In support of the
notion that its position is the logical consequence of the application of EU law, Spain

submits the expert reports of Professor Gosalbo with its Memorial and Reply.”

even though the following overview is limited to a high level description of the main

themes of Spain’s argumentation.

a. ECT does not apply between Member States of the EU as a matter of international
law
107. As the starting point, Spain argues that a proper application of customary rules of
international law on the interpretation of treaties “... obliges us to conclude that the ECT
(including Article 26) does not apply within the EU.””’ Spain further alleges that the
Tribunal did not carry out an analysis of all the rules of interpretation set forth in Article
31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”), but merely indicated

that there was no disconnection clause and, on that basis, concluded it had jurisdiction.”

>

EU law and primacy of EU law

108. Second, and alternatively, the Applicant alleges that even if it were possible to interpret
Article 26 ECT as covering intra-EU disputes, such interpretation would conflict with
the EU treaties, and that conflict, as a matter of international law, must be resolved in

favor of EU law.”

109. Spain argues that the ECT as a multilateral treaty, which has been signed by the EU, was
not designed to comprise the settlement of disputes between different Member States of
the EU and that the proper application of the customary rules of international law of
interpretation leads to the conclusion that the ECT (including Article 26(6)) does not
apply within the EU.*°

110. According to the Applicant, in case of conflict between the ECT and EU law, the EU
Member States have agreed on a specific rule for resolution of treaty disputes. In other
words, Spain says, “the primacy of EU law is a special conflict rule under international

law.”8!

111. Spain further explains that relations between EU Member States are governed by the
principle of “mutual trust,” and as part of this system the autonomy and uniform
application of EU law is guaranteed by the powers of the CJEU.*? Spain explains that
“... in view of Articles 267 and 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU

(“TFEU”), the EU Treaties have always prohibited EU Member States from offering to

settle investor-state disputes within the EU before international arbitration tribunals. This

is true not only with respect to BITs, but also with respect to multilateral treaties, such

as the ECT.”*?

112. The interpretation and application of EU law and its enforcement by the Member States
is a matter for the CJEU as the ultimate interpreter of EU law and which has exclusive
jurisdiction to determine its scope and content.** For purposes of ensuring consistency
and uniform interpretation of EU law, Article 267 of the TFEU provides that the highest
court in each Member State may refer questions of EU law to the CJEU for a preliminary
ruling. The decision of the CJEU in resolving the preliminary ruling question is binding
on all courts of the Member States. ** Article 344 of the TFEU prohibits Member States
from submitting disputes concerning interpretation or application to a method of dispute

settlement other than their courts. °°

c. The Achmea judgment

113. The Applicant argues that the Achmea judgment is crucial.” Spain recalls that the CIEU

stated in this decision that Member States of the EU are prohibited from submitting to

dispute resolution mechanisms outside of the EU judicial system pursuant to Article 267

and 344 of the TFEU.**

114. The Applicant summarized the Achmea case in its pleadings as follows. In 2008,
Achmea brought an arbitration proceeding against Slovakia under the Czechoslovakia-
Netherlands BIT of 1991 on the grounds of a ban imposed on distribution of profits
generated by health insurance activities. In 2012, the tribunal found Slovakia violated
the BIT. Subsequently, Slovakia appealed to the German Courts on the basis that the
arbitration clause of the Czechoslovakia-Netherlands BIT was contrary to several
provisions of the TFEU. The German Court referred the question to the CJEU for a
preliminary ruling on whether the arbitration clause was compatible with Articles 18,

267, and 244 of the TFEU.

115. The Applicant describes that the Achmea judgment is relevant to the present case because
it specifically examined whether an arbitral tribunal in international investment
arbitration complies and is compatible with the principles of EU law. Spain summarizes

the conclusions of the CJEU as follows: *°

- The Arbitral Tribunal is not part of the European Union's judicial system,
nor can it be described as a court “of a Member State” that can refer a
question to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling.

- Disputes before Investment Protection Arbitration Tribunals may affect
the application or interpretation of EU law and should therefore be subject
to the EU judicial system.

- Through the arbitration clause, Member States agree to deviate from the
jurisdiction of their own courts and therefore from the EU judicial review
system, so that there can be no guarantee that disputes submitted to
arbitration will be resolved in a way that ensures the full effectiveness of
EU law.

- Under Article 8(7) of the BIT the decision of the arbitral tribunal provided
for in that article is final and the legal examination may be exerted by a
National court only insofar as national law permits it.

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 38 of 169

116. Spain recounts that as a result of the Achmea judgment, the German Federal Court
annulled the arbitration award on the basis that EU law provided that there was no
agreement to submit the dispute to arbitration under German law. According to Spain,
the reasoning followed by the CJEU in Achmea has been confirmed in cases where the

EU itself is a party to the international treaty.”

d. EC intervention/declarations

117. Spain further states that “Achmea’s application to the underlying arbitration has been
declared by two more sources: the European Commission and the Member States

themselves involved in the dispute before this Committee.””!

118. Spain submits that based on the Achmea decision, the European Commission issued its

argues that Article 26 not only refers to “Contracting Parties” but also to “Areas” which

the Tribunal did not even analyze.”

119. Ona related note, Spain explained that in January 2019 almost all Member States signed
a political declaration through which they stated that arbitration clauses such as the one
provided in the ECT could not be understood as a consent to submit intra-EU disputes

to arbitration. °°

EU law and the ECT and the impact on this case

120. In light of its overview of these various sources and developments, Spain submits that
the Achmea case is directly applicable to this case as it explains the interaction between
EU law and the ECT. The Applicant argues that the Achmea judgment is applicable
because “it is called for the application of EU law and is not the Award subject to review

by the European Union’s judicial system.” By virtue of the Achmea judgment Spain

submits that Article 26(4) ECT is not applicable to intra-EU disputes. °°

121. Spain alleges that the ECT, as a multilateral treaty, has been signed by the EU as well as
Member States that form part the EU. The Applicant recalls that the dispute resolution
provisions contained in the ECT call for disputes to be resolved in “accordance with the
ECT and applicable rules of international law”®”

122. Spain concludes its analysis of Achmea as follows: “the application of the position of the

CJEU in its Achmea judgment to the present case is undisputed: clauses such as Article

26(6) ECT cannot be applied between Member States of the Union, as is the case here.”””

Consequently, Spain requests that the Committee “correct the incorrect determination of

applicable law made by the Tribunal...” !°°

123. The Applicant alleges that the Tribunal’s Decision is wrong in analyzing its jurisdiction.
According to the Applicant, the Tribunal incorrectly interpreted EU law and
consequently, contrary to the principles of EU law, decided it had jurisdiction. First,
concerning the Tribunal’s decision that the ECT does not provide a differentiated
treatment for Member States of the EU, Spain argues that the Tribunal ignored (i) the
series of treaties that make up EU law and prevail over the ECT on the basis of the
principle of primacy, and (ii) the literal application of the phrase Regional Economic

Integration and Organization (“REIO”).'°!

124. Second, on the Tribunal’s decision that the context and object of the ECT did not support
Spain’s position, the Applicant alleges that the Tribunal denied the implicit

disconnection clause in Article 16 ECT.

125. Finally, the Applicant also argues that the Decision was wrong because it denied any
relevance to the Achmea ruling. According to Spain, the Tribunal had to analyze the
Achmea judgment to analyze the regulations on State aid. Spain also argues that it is
concerning that the Tribunal decided to rely on the Advocate General’s conclusions

instead of the Achmea judgment itself. !

126. In its Reply, the Applicant addresses the requirement of Article 52(1)(b) that any excess
of powers must be manifest. It submits that this requirement is fulfilled because from
the outset, i.e. from the submission of the request for arbitration, it was evident that the
dispute was an intra-EU dispute involving two EU investors against another EU State —
a “notorious fact” which reinforced the manifest nature of the excess of jurisdiction. On
this basis, Spain invoked the intra-EU objection from the outset of the arbitration.

Additionally, Spain argues that the EU Commission sought to intervene to “question the

Spain submits that the excess of jurisdiction is more than evident. !"

(3) EU Law as the Law Applicable to the Merits

Spain argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by disregarding the
application of EU law to the merits. '°* Spain further argues that the Tribunal erred when
drawing a distinction between the EU treaties and EU secondary legislation as well as

by failing to recognize the supremacy of EU law.!

Spain also alleges that the Tribunal “... overlooked the fact that the rules on state aid are
to be found in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, specifically in
Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU... the Tribunal in Cube did not explain in any way
why, if the treaties of the European Union were, according to its own conclusion,
applicable rules under Article 26(6) ECT, Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU should be
ignored in the present case.” °° Spain states that the Tribunal decided that the European
regulations were not applicable on an artificial distinction between the treaties of the

Union and secondary legislation. !°”

As a result, according to Spain, the Tribunal “... does not correctly identify the law
applicable to the dispute and in interpreting this law, clearly errs, incurring in the alleged
cause of annulment for exceeding powers.... In short, the lack of application of the
applicable rules is an obvious excess that should lead to the annulment of the award.”!°
According to Spain, if the Tribunal had applied EU law, it would have had to consider
“... (i) whether RD 661/2007 had been notified to the European Commission and (ii)
what impact such non-notification would have on investors’ expectation.”! Finally,

Spain quotes Professor Gosalbo who states in his report that “[a]ccording to the state aid

law of the European Union an investor cannot rely on legitimate expectations to receive
state aid that had not been notified to and approved by the Commission before being

granted.” !!°

131. In its Reply, Spain argues that EU law should be applied according to the law of treaties
from, international custom as well as the general principles of law.''! Specifically, Spain
argues that the autonomy and supremacy of EU law must be respected internationally as
constituting customary international law.''!? Spain submits that “... the effect of the
autonomy and primacy of EU law is to allow the EU and states to apply EU law rather
than international treaties for matters within the EU, even if those treaties do not have a
disconnection clause.”!'!? Spain further argues that applying Article 30 of the VCLT, the
Lisbon Treaty is /ex posterior to the ECT, hence, the Lisbon Treaty (i.e. EU law) would

prevail. !!4

132. Spain argues that the two elements necessary to constitute binding international
customary law are present and therefore the principles of autonomy and supremacy of
EU law must be respected.!!> Referring to various multilateral treaties, Spain argues that
these have been replaced or suspended within the EU due to the autonomy and primacy
of EU law.''® Spain alleges that “customary international law concerning the autonomy
and primacy of EU law makes this autonomy and primacy act bi-directionally: both in
relation to previous treaties and in relation to future treaties. Thus, past and future treaties
are not applicable to intra~Community matter if the EU understands that it has a legal
regime on the same subject matter that makes the application of those conventions

unnecessary.” !!7

133. In relation to the general principles of law, according to Spain, the Tribunal ignored the
practice of Member States to respect EU law on State aid and “completely dispensed

with the application of applicable international law.”!!®

134. Spain concludes, the Award should be annulled in accordance with Article 52(1)(b) of
the ICSID Convention, because the Tribunal failed to apply, or alternatively misapplied,
EU law and gave an interpretation contrary to EU law when it recognized the existence

of legitimate expectations on the part of Cube and Demeter.!!?

Cube and Demeter argue that Spain has mischaracterized the applicable legal standard
and that it “fails to note that there is a two-step approach in assessing whether an award
must be annulled under Article 52(1)(b), namely whether (i) the tribunal has exceeded

its powers; and (ii) whether the excess is manifest.” !7°

Cube and Demeter submit that the ordinary meaning of “manifest” is obvious or clear. !7!
The Respondents also provide the definition in Black’s Law Dictionary defining
“manifest injustice” as “an error in the trial court that is direct, obvious, and observable.”
Cube and Demeter conclude that the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 52(1)(b)
of the ICSID Convention solely concern obvious and clear excesses of power.'?? In

decisions showing that “manifest” requires “textual ‘obviousness’ and ‘self-evidence’

that is ‘plain on its face” and require that the error be obvious and self-evident. !7

137. Cube and Demeter submit that an excess of power may exist if the tribunal exercises
jurisdiction that it does not have or if it fails to apply proper law. According to the
Respondents, “in the present case there was not even an improper exercise of jurisdiction
or a failure to apply the proper law to begin with, much less an instance of such that was
‘manifest’ or ‘egregious.””!*+ The Respondents argue that the standard is “very high”
and that for an error to be “egregious” the misapplication must be “of such a nature or

degree as to constitute objectively (regardless of the Tribunal’s actual or presumed

intentions) its effective non-application.” !75

unwarranted, furnishes no grounds for annulment.”!?° What is more, the Respondents

say, “a mere error in the tribunal’s jurisdictional findings does not constitute a ground of

errors identified by Spain do not meet the required threshold and that the conclusions
reached by the Tribunal are the same conclusions about the irrelevancy of EU law that

have been reached by many other tribunals to date. !”°

The Respondents note that even assuming that the Tribunal erred, “the errors come
nowhere near the level of ‘manifest’ or ‘egregious’ that Spain would need to demonstrate
in order to demonstrate ‘manifest excess of power.””!*° Cube and Demeter submit that
“the manifest nature of the excess of powers has been interpreted by most ad hoc
committees to mean an excess that is obvious, clear or self-evident, discernable without
the need for an elaborate analysis of the award.” '?! The Respondents further contend
that Spain’s allegations do not constitute a manifest excess of powers and that “not a
single ECT tribunal has concluded that EU law is relevant in the manner Spain suggests;

and several dozen tribunals have concluded that it is not.”!°?

Cube and Demeter explain the “manifest” threshold of the standard and recall that “[a]s
decided by many annulment committees, an excess of power is manifest if it is obvious,
clear or self-evident. In this regard, the fact that a tribunal has relied to make its decision

on tenable solutions adopted in several previous cases may be considered as an indication

that an excess of power is not manifest.” !*3

(2) Correct Declaration of Jurisdiction
a. ECT applies to intra-EU disputes

141. Cube and Demeter submit that the Tribunal correctly interpreted the ECT in accordance
with the VCLT. Insofar as Spain now invokes customary international law, Cube and

Demeter argue that this has no merit. '*

142. As regards Spain’s intra-EU objection, Cube and Demeter submit that the plain meaning
of the terms of Article 26(3) ECT is that “each and every Contracting Party to the ECT,
i.e., including each and every EU country that has signed the ECT (which is all EU
Member States, including Spain), give their ‘unconditional consent’ to investor-State

dispute resolution in accordance with the terms of the article.” '*5

143. Cube and Demeter argue that the Tribunal correctly interpreted the ECT in accordance
with the VCLT and found no such exception. On this point, the Respondents note that
the Tribunal, as have dozens of other tribunals, concluded that “the literal meaning leaves

no doubts.” !36

144. Cube and Demeter object to Spain’s argument regarding the interpretation of the
historical “context” of the ECT, which Spain failed to make in the underlying arbitration
and therefore falls outside the scope of these proceedings. '*” The Respondents argue
that this argument has been rejected by other tribunals that have made a detailed analysis
and found that there is “nothing in the context of the ECT [that] indicates an intent to
exclude ‘intra-EU’ disputes from the scope of Article 26 ECT.”'*® According to the
Respondents, tribunals have found that the “terms of the ECT are unambiguous and do

not lead to an outcome that is ‘manifestly absurd and unreasonable,’ there is no basis on

highlight that the Tribunal’s conclusion is the same as that which at least 27 other ECT
tribunals have reached, namely “that the plain terms of the ECT do not contain an

exception to the dispute resolution provision of ‘intra-EU’ disputes.” '#°

145. On the issue of the definition of REIO and Territory under the ECT, the Respondents
emphasize that this is a new argument which Spain did not raise in the underlying
arbitration other than to refer to the “special nature of the EU” in the ECT, and the

Tribunal therefore did not need to address the arguments. '“!

146. Cube and Demeter dispute Spain’s argument that because the ECT recognizes certain
REIOs that enter into obligations amongst themselves, and because the EU is a REIO,
this would entail a recognition that establishes some sort of exclusivity rendering the
ECT inapplicable among the EU Members. According to Cube and Demeter, this is a
“distortion of the explicit provisions of the ECT” because neither the definition of
“REIO” or of “Territory” of a REIO in Articles 1(3) and 1(10) of the ECT contain
language affecting the ability of Investors of EU Members States to commence
arbitration against other EU Member States. Instead, the ECT merely acknowledges that
some Contracting Parties are also members of regional organizations and these are

defined terms, nothing more. '”

Other ECT tribunals have rejected this argument, and
none has accepted it. '*? For example, in PV Investors the tribunal rejected the argument,
holding that if this interpretation were accepted “with respect to a [REIO] (Article 1(10),

second sentence), the relevant Area would be the entire EU Area and the diversity of

area requirement would have to be satisfied with respect to that territory. This is,

however, not the scenario before the Tribunal.” '##

Cube and Demeter argue that there is no disconnection clause in the ECT and they reject
the newly raised argument that the 1998 EC statement submitted to the Secretariat of the
ECT upon its ratification shows that despite the clear and unambiguous terms of Article
26, “that provision was never intended to apply intra-EU.”'*5 “Had the EU and its
Member States intended not to apply certain provisions of the ECT among themselves,
they would have no doubt expressly included such a caveat in this statement that
addresses the very possibility that EU Member States could be respondents to

international arbitration proceedings. They did not do so.” !4

Cube and Demeter point out that “[i]t is notable that before the ECT entered into force
the EU already had incorporated express disconnection clauses into other treaties, to
ensure that the provisions of a mixed agreement would not apply as between EU Member
States. This confirms the obvious, that it knew how to provide for these when it wished
to do so.” '4” In fact, the Respondents point out that the disconnection clause never made
it to the final version of the Treaty as ratified by the Contracting Parties. '** Furthermore,
Cube and Demeter also dispute the novel argument that the Lisbon Treaty introduced an

implicit disconnection clause in the ECT. '?

Cube and Demeter also respond to Spain’s argument related to Article 25 ECT. The
Respondents argue that Article 25 does not recognize the primacy of EU law or that the
Tribunal cannot hear an arbitration between two Member States. According to Cube and

Demeter, Article 25 “provides an exception to the ECT’s most-favored nation (““MFN”)

clause to parties in an ‘Economic Integration Area,’ and simply confirms that the ECT
does not require the EU and its Member States to extend any ‘preferential treatment’ that

may apply under EU treaties to the non-EU Contracting Parties to the ECT...”.!*°

b. Irrelevance of the Achmea judgment

150. Cube and Demeter argue that another argument that Spain has continued to make and
which has never succeeded in the ECT context is the citation of the Achmea judgment
which was rendered during the underlying arbitration in this case. The Parties made

submissions to the Tribunal on this issue following the rendering of the judgment. '*!

151. Cube and Demeter state that the Tribunal correctly found that there are certain
specificities that make Achmea inapposite as precedent for this case.'** Referring to
OREN, the Respondents note that “the [European Court of Justice] affirmed the treaty-
making authority of the EU to enter into treaties which include a dispute resolution
mechanism outside the framework of the EU courts...” '** The Respondents further state

that no ECT tribunal has ever concluded that Achmea is relevant to the ECT context. !*4

152. Cube and Demeter also reject the allegation that the Achmea reasoning has been applied
in the context of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement
(“CETA”), to which the EU is a Contracting Party. The ECJ’s Opinion 1/17, issued on
April 30, 2019, on the compatibility with EU law of the investor-state dispute settlement
mechanism in CETA in light of Achmea, was not part of the underlying arbitration
record. Furthermore, the Opinion, in fact undermines Spain’s argument, as it confirms
that Achmea holds no relevance for treaties like the ECT concluded by the EU itself; and
dispute resolution tribunals such as the Tribunal do not adversely affect the EU legal

order by virtue of the fact that they sit outside the EU judicial system. !°°

153. Lastly, the Respondents also argue that Spain has inappropriately tried to support its
intra-EU objection by citing the January 2019 Declaration of the EU Member States and
the EC’s 2018 communication in relation to Achmea. Once again, the Respondents
sustain, these documents were not before the Tribunal and should not be considered by

the Committee. !*°

154. On the EC’s 2018 Communication, the Respondents pose that this was issued by the EU
parliament after the hearing in this case and neither party sought to introduce it to the
Tribunal. The Respondents argue that it is “largely irrelevant” and that “it is a non-
binding political statement.”!*’ Cube and Demeter point out that other tribunals have

confirmed that “this ‘communication’ has no authoritative value whatsoever.” !*8

155. As regards to the January 2019 Declaration of EU Member States, Cube and Demeter
argue that those documents were not before the Tribunal and therefore should not be
considered by the Committee. '*? In any case, the Respondents conclude by saying that
this Declaration was issued after the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed and, upon
Spain’s request for introduction, the Tribunal refused to admit it. According to Cube

and Demeter, the Tribunal was fully within its power to do so.'°°

156. Cube and Demeter add that as the Member States signed three different declarations they
demonstrate there is in fact no common ground even within the EU as to the meaning or
relevance of Achmea. Numerous tribunals have found that the EU Member States’
various contradictory Declarations are not EU legal instruments and do not have an

interpretive effect regarding EU law. '°!

157. The Respondents conclude that the 2018 Communication and the 2019 Declarations “are
political statements with no authoritative force in terms of interpreting or applying EU
law... From an EU law perspective, only the [European Court of Justice] has authority
to extend its reasoning in Achmea to the ECT,” which it has not.'°* According to Cube
and Demeter, although the Committee is not tasked with considering new events and
should disregard arguments relating thereto, Spain is selective and neglected other recent
developments not supporting its case. In particular, in the Agreement for the
Termination of the BITs between EU Member States adopted in May they confirmed
that Achmea did not have an impact upon the ECT and that it would be dealt with at a

later stage. !°

(3) Primacy or Autonomy Would Not Change the Outcome

158. As regards Spain’s EU primacy or autonomy argument, Cube and Demeter consider that
this argument has been considered by the Tribunal and falls outside the Committee’s
scope of review.'°+ Further to this argument, Cube and Demeter note that “EU law is
subordinate to public international law, both generally and especially when the public
international law in question is an international treaty such as the ECT to which the EU
is a Contracting Party.”!°° Cube and Demeter argue that Spain, and its expert Professor
Gosalbo, “overlook Article 216 of the TFEU, which provides that ‘Agreements
concluded by the Union are binding upon the institutions of the Union and on its Member
States.””!° The Respondents further argue that “since the ECT is an international

agreement ‘concluded by the Union,’ it is binding on Spain, the EC, and the ECJ.”!7

159. Cube and Demeter explain that the principle of primacy “refers to the domestic law of

Member States and says nothing about the relationship between the EU treaties and

public international law, including international treaties such as the ECT to which the

EU is a party.” 1%

160. The Respondents contend that “even assuming a conflict between EU law and the ECT
were to exist, which has been expressly rejected by multiple ECT tribunals faced with
this identical argument, the principle of ‘primacy’ of EU law does not amount to a
conflict rule under international law. International law is clear that in the event of a

conflict, the next step is to apply any conflict-resolution clauses contained in the two

9169

treaties at issue. According to the Respondents, the ECT contains a clear and

unequivocal conflicts clause at Article 16. There is no scope therefore for the application
of Article 351 TFEU, which in any event merely provides for the Member States to take
steps to eliminate any incompatibilities.'”” Insofar as Spain, through Prof Gosalbo,
advances in new argument that Article 351 of the TFEU codified the /ex posterior rule
of treaty interpretation which, if applied, would result the TFEU prevailing over the ECT,

met, namely that the treaties are successive, have the same subject matter and are

incompatible. According to the Respondents, Spain has not demonstrated that these

requirements have been fulfilled and there is “simply no basis to apply the /ex posterior

rule.”!7!

(4) Breach of EU law

a. EU Law Not Applicable Under the ECT

161.

Cube and Demeter explained that in the underlying arbitration, Spain did not ask the

Tribunal to apply EU law to the merits of the dispute.'”? Spain only argued that the

Tribunal should have applied EU law for purposes of jurisdiction, since it could fall

within the reference of “rules and principles of international law” in Article 26(6)

ECT.!73 Cube and Demeter state that the Tribunal did analyze the applicability of EU

law when interpreting the ECT. !

162. In response to Spain’s argument that the Tribunal held that EU treaties (as primary

sources of EU law) did fall within the category of ‘rules and principles of international

law’ under Article 26(6), but that EU law from secondary sources did not, Cube and

Demeter argue that what the Tribunal found was that “all EU law, whether from primary

or secondary sources, did not fall within the scope of ECT Article 26(6).

2175

163. The Respondents sustain that the Tribunal also correctly distinguished between two legal

orders, that of general international law to which the ECT refers and the separate,

regional system of EU law.

176

On that basis, Cube and Demeter say, the Tribunal

concluded that the parties to the ECT could not have intended Article 26(6) to include

EU law given the considerable number of non-EU contracting parties to the ECT.!7’

Finally, Cube and Demeter argue that consistent with rulings in many other intra~-EU

ECT cases, the Tribunal held that as a tribunal of public international law it was not

bound by or subject to EU law or the European legal order. !7*

b. Applying EU Law on State Aid Would Not Have Led to a Different Outcome

164. With respect to rules on State aid, the Respondents point out that the Tribunal concluded
that EU treaties (and EU law in general) were not principles of international law under
Article 26(6) ECT and thus did not apply to the underlying dispute. Cube and Demeter
highlight that the Tribunal noted that the dispute concerned a breach of the ECT, and not

a breach of EU law or Spanish law.!7

165. Cube and Demeter argue that in any event, Spain’s arguments on EU State aid law are
incorrect. First, Cube and Demeter explain, Spain bases much of its arguments on the
2017 EC Decision on State Aid, and “the 2017 EC Decision did not assess, much less
reach any conclusions on, whether the Spanish incentives regime under which Cube and
Demeter invested, known as RD 661/2007, constituted state aid under EU law, or if so,
whether they were compatible with EU state aid law.”'*° Cube and Demeter assert that
the decision itself plainly states that it concerned exclusively Spain’s New Regulatory
Regime, which was not the regime under which Cube and Demeter invested. Cube and
Demeter add that “even then the EC concluded that that particular regime was
compatible, rather than incompatible, state aid.” '*!

166. Second, Cube and Demeter add, “the evidence demonstrates that Spain itself never
viewed RD 661/2007 ‘state aid,’ much less incompatible state aid that violated EU

99 182

law.. Third, Cube and Demeter argue that even assuming for purposes of the

argument that RD 661/2007 were State aid “within the meaning of EU law at the time

they were enacted and at the time Cube and Demeter invested in Spain, that would only
address the first of many steps that Spain’s argument requires...”!*? And finally, the
Respondents add, fourth, “compliance with EU state aid law is an obligation of Spain,

not investors.” !*4

167. Consequently, Cube and Demeter conclude, even if the Tribunal had applied EU law to
the merits of the dispute, it would have made no difference to the outcome “because there
was nothing about the regimes under which Cube and Demeter invested that involved

those rules in any way...”.!8°

168. In their Rejoinder, Cube and Demeter note that Spain developed an entirely new
argument in support of the intra~-EU objection that it never raised in the underlying
arbitration or in the Memorial. Cube and Demeter describe that “Spain claims that the
Tribunal should have applied certain, undefined principles of EU law which, in Spain’s
view, amount to customary international law, taking precedence over the ECT, and in
doing so would have resulted in the Tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction.”!*° According to
Cube and Demeter, this is another attempt by Spain to “apply an implied disconnection
clause to the ECT, but this time alleging that an ‘international custom’ has arisen that
would require the Tribunal to read the ECT as inapplicable among EU Member
States.”!87 Cube and Demeter oppose this argument as untimely and outside of the scope

of the proceeding. '**

169. Nonetheless, the Respondents addressed the issue for the sake of completeness and noted
that Spain did not demonstrate how the purported regional custom on EU autonomy and
primacy satisfies the legal standard of the Right of Passage'® case. Cube and Demeter

further explain that the International Court of Justice “... has in no way suggested that

continue saying that they do not agree with Spain’s view of the existence of an EU
custom through which Member States are allowed to apply EU law rather that
international treaties for matters within the EU, even if those treaties do not have a

disconnection clause. !?!

According to Cube and Demeter, the examples provided by Spain do not support its
position but rather they “show nothing more than the correct application of the Vienna
Convention by the EU, in modifying certain international conventions in order to
introduce more specific rules for its Member States on the same subject matter” and

which has nothing to do with the status of the ECT. !?

THE COMMITTEE’S ANALYSIS
(1) Applicable Legal Standard

The Committee considers that Article 52(1)(b) provides that only instances of manifest
excess of the tribunal’s power may lead to an annulment, indicating a double requirement

of “excess” that is “manifest.”!°>

Regardless of whether this double requirement
amounts to a two-step analysis, as Cube and Demeter submit, or rather a prima facie test
consisting of a summary examination to determine whether any of the excesses could be

viewed as “manifest,” there can be no doubt that an unqualified excess is insufficient.

In the present case, although Spain has sought to argue that based on the Spanish and
French versions of the ICSID Convention the meaning of manifest may be somewhat
more limited than argued by Cube and Demeter, this double standard requirement is not
disputed. The Committee is not persuaded by Spain’s argument that the Spanish and/or

French versions suggest a different meaning than the English version of the ICSID

Convention. The Committee is of the view that in any version, the word “manifest”, or
the equivalent thereof, serves to qualify the reference to “excess” and not merely to
confirm and duplicate the reference to “excess” or to refer to the “discovery” or

manifestation of an excess.

In fact, Spain seems to acknowledge that the purpose of the term “manifest” is to qualify
the meaning of excess of powers as being “easy to see or understand.” !*4 Furthermore,
in its discussion whether and if so, to what extent there was a manifest excess of powers
relating to the applicable law in this case, which will be further addressed below, Spain
refers to a disregard of the applicable law that is “so gross or egregious as substantially

9195

to amount to a failure to apply the proper law, effectively again recognizing the

qualified meaning of the term “manifest.”

As the Updated ICSID Background Paper on Annulment states, by reference to
numerous decisions, the manifest nature of an excess of powers has been interpreted by
most ad hoc committees to mean an excess that is obvious, clear or self-evident, and is

discernible without the need for an elaborate analysis of the award. !°°

An excess of power may arise when a tribunal exceeds the mandate given to it by the
parties, in particular, by going beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement and by
deciding on issues that were not submitted to it, and by failing to apply the proper law
agreed on by the parties. A manifest excess of power may therefore occur both at the

jurisdiction and at the merits stage.

As to jurisdiction, while an excess of power may relate to a tribunal’s incorrect
conclusion that it has jurisdiction, as the Updated ICSID Background Paper on
Annulment notes, the tribunal is the judge of its own competence. This needs to be kept
in mind in reviewing the alleged excess of power, to avoid straying beyond the limited

remit of an annulment committee.

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 58 of 169

177. Although every case must be viewed on its own merits, including the record before the
relevant tribunal, the Committee is mindful of the fact that solutions adopted by a
particular tribunal on the basis of other, potentially comparable, cases may impact the
evaluation on whether an excess of powers is manifest. As the committee in Teinver
considered: “as decided by many annulment committees, an excess of powers is manifest
if it is obvious, clear or self-evident. In this regard, the fact that a tribunal has relied to
make its decision on tenable solutions adopted in several previous cases may be
considered as an indication that the excess of powers is not manifest.”!°’ It is on this
basis that the Committee will consider the impact of the concrete manifestations of

alleged excess of powers.

178. Spain has not explicitly addressed whether the “manifest” test requires a two-step
analysis, i.e. a determination whether there was an excess of powers, and if so whether
the excess was manifest, which is the approach Cube and Demeter favor. Nor has Spain
addressed whether it is more appropriate to have a prima facie approach consisting of a
summary examination to determine whether any of the alleged excesses of power could

be viewed as “manifest.” !°*

Spain’s main submissions in relation to the alleged
“manifest” nature of the alleged excesses of powers, which will be discussed below (see
Section V.C.(4)), provide some support for the notion that Spain too considers a two-
step approach appropriate. For example, in its Reply, Spain refers to a number of reasons
for a manifest excess of powers, and in particular the “notorious fact” that the Tribunal
knew from the beginning of the arbitration that it was facing an intra-EU dispute, a fact

that would reinforce the manifest nature of the excess of jurisdiction. !”°

179. In any event, under either approach, a committee’s remit is limited and may not amount
to an appeal. A committee should be cautious not to overstep the boundaries of the
annulment, including the scope of the arguments made and the evidence submitted.

Although a review in annulment will require a certain amount of analysis, this should, in

principle, not involve an extensive argumentation to prove that the excess of power has

in fact occurred.?”

(2) The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction
a. The Tribunal’s Decision

180. The structure of Spain’s argument contains a certain amount of duplication notably in
relation to the first and the second ground. At the same time it refers to the Tribunal’s
rejection of the “intra~-EU objection” as shorthand or a catchall phrase for its argument
that the Tribunal incorrectly concluded that it had jurisdiction, and/or, in doing so

misapplied the applicable law in respect of jurisdiction.

181. In addition, Spain submits that the Tribunal’s treatment of the applicable law in so far as
it relates to the merits is the second manifestation of the alleged failure to apply the
correct law; this aspect of Spain’s argument will be discussed separately in Section

V.C.(3) (paras. 221 et. seq.).

182. The core issue before this Committee is: did the Tribunal manifestly exceed its powers
by declaring that it had jurisdiction on the basis of Article 26 ECT in light of the fact that

the dispute involves only EU Member States?7°!

183. The Tribunal relied on general rules of interpretation as laid down in Article 31 VCLT
to support its conclusion that it had jurisdiction. In doing so, as a starting point, the
Tribunal noted that the text of Article 26(1) ECT does not differentiate between different
classes of Contracting Parties. It further noted that while the ECT does impose explicit
restrictions in order to accommodate the position of particular States, namely in the event

of a conflict between the Svalbard Treaty and the ECT, no such provision was made in

order to restrict the application of the ECT to disputes involving the EU or its Member

States?”

184. Next, the Tribunal considered whether the terms of the Treaty in context or the object
and purpose of Article 26(1) ECT suggest a different meaning that would permit reading
an implicit disconnection clause into the provision. In particular, in this context, it
considered and rejected Spain’s argument that the reference in Article 26(6) ECT to
“applicable rules and principles of international law” includes EU law and furthermore
that EU law has supremacy over other rules of international law, including the ECT. The
Tribunal stated that EU law does not have supremacy and such claim to priority would
challenge the basis of the ECT as a multilateral treaty,?°? The Tribunal concluded that
Article 26(6) ECT does not reverse the clear meaning of the first paragraph of Article 26
EcT.™

185. The Tribunal addressed the question of the relevance of EU law to the merits in the
context of its decision on jurisdiction. It recalled that these proceedings are brought
pursuant to Article 26(4) ECT which provides for ICSID arbitration, whereas Article
26(6) ECT stipulates that the applicable law to the dispute is international law, and thus
particularly the ECT. While EU treaties are international law, they are not “principles
of international law.”?°5 The Tribunal considered that the submissions before it did not
suggest that the EU treaties were directly applicable, and while the rules established by
EU secondary legislation — such as rules against State aid — are EU law, they are plainly

not “principles of international law.”?°°

186. Moreover, the Tribunal considered that Article 16 ECT, and in particular Article 16(2)
ECT is relevant and confirms that the ECT Contracting Parties did not agree that EU
legal rules take precedence over any incompatible rules of whatever source, so that the

ECT jurisdictional clause would become inapplicable should any inconsistency be

found.?°’ The Tribunal found the construction defended by Spain, based on Article 16(1)
ECT, all the less persuasive since it would mean that the explicit clauses of Article 26(1),
(2), and (3) ECT would be undermined and deprived of their substance “through a back

door.”208

187. Finally, as to jurisdiction, the Tribunal held that the Achmea judgment was inapposite.
The Tribunal distinguished the Achmea case in a number of ways, including by pointing
out the strong territorial link in that case between the proceedings and the German legal
order. This Tribunal owes its emergence, not to a domestic legal order, but rather to two
international treaties, the ECT and the ICSID Convention.”°? Moreover, the Tribunal
found that there is no evidence demonstrating that the three States involved exceeded the
limits of their treaty making power to the detriment of the European Economic
Community or the European Community. In this context, the Tribunal specifically
referred to the Lisbon Treaty which allocated new powers to the EU, without addressing
the position of existing BITs. “If general agreement had existed to the effect that the
procedural mechanisms of those BITs were incompatible with the applicable treaty
regime presumed the effect could have been remedied easily.”*!° The Tribunal also
deemed it highly significant that the EC did not launch infringement proceedings against
EU States parties to bilateral intra-EU BITs as soon as the Lisbon Treaty entered into

force.?!!

188. In formulating its request for annulment, Spain has to some extent reiterated its
arguments and allegations in the underlying arbitration, and to some extent reformulated
its position, enhancing and, in some cases, significantly supplementing its arguments and
allegations. This is apparent not only from the fact that it has submitted new expert
reports containing legal arguments not previously made, but also from the fact that it

seeks to submit documents not included in the arbitration record, notably in relation to

207 RL-0093, Decision, ff 131-132.

various aspects of EU law and/or the position of the European Court of Justice (“ECS”)
and CJEU and/or European Commission. There is also some fluidity in the way in which
and the sequence in which certain arguments are addressed, for example, the alleged
primacy of EU law and the impact thereof, and the meaning and impact of the concept
of a REIO in Article 1 ECT. This fluidity and the many reformulations of arguments
previously made, also within these annulment proceedings, complicates the assessment
whether arguments are new and different or were made in the context of the original
arbitration proceedings, as they should be or have been in order for this Committee to

entertain the arguments.
189. Spain’s arguments now consist of the following (interrelated) components:

a. Customary rules of international law on the interpretation of treaties lead to the
conclusion that the ECT including Article 26 does not apply within the EU. The
Tribunal has failed to apply Article 31 VCLT, nor did it consider the lack of
competence of new Members to enter into obligations with each other as a result of
the transfer of competence to the EU.

b. Even if Article 26 ECT covers intra-EU disputes, such an interpretation would
conflict with the EU treaties and that conflict, as a matter of international law, must
be resolved in favor of EU law.

c. The correctness of Spain’s position is confirmed by the Achmea judgment, as well
as by the European Commission and Member States;

d. Mutual trust further militates against the notion of intra-Community arbitration;

e. Primacy of EU law is a special conflict law so that Article 26 ECT is not applicable
between Member States.

b. The interpretation of Article 26

190. The Committee will first address Spain’s basis for the legal analysis and in particular
whether there is room for an analysis on the basis of customary rules of international

law.

191. The reliance on customary rules of international law appears to be a new argument,
largely pleaded by reference to the Expert Reports submitted by Spain. While Spain
refers to customary rules of international law as a tool for reviewing the Tribunal’s
decision that it had jurisdiction on the basis of Article 26 ECT, its argument has

developed and changed over the course of these annulment proceedings. However that

52

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 63 of 169

may be, Spain does not (and cannot) dispute that in any event, the starting point for the
analysis of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is Article 31 VCLT, and that on this basis, the
relevant treaty provisions shall be interpreted by considering the text in their context and

in the light of its object and purpose.

192. Spain appears to take issue with the way in which the Tribunal has applied Article 31
VCLT, not that it set out to do so in the first place: “[t]he Arbitral Tribunal has not carried
out an analysis of the rules of interpretation provided for in Article 31 of the [VCLT],
but merely indicated that there was no disconnection clause and on that basis indicated
what its conclusion was.”?!? Also in its Reply, Spain itself refers first to the literal
interpretation of Article 26 ECT, and secondly refers to the interpretation of this

provision “in accordance with the objective and purpose of the Treaty.”?!?

193. Spain’s interest in invoking customary international law appears to be an attempt to
strengthen a number of specific arguments also raised separately, such as the alleged
primacy of EU law as a special conflict rule under international law,?'* as well as
invoking new arguments raised by reference to Prof. Gosalbo’s Expert Reports, which
contain numerous references to other treaties, State practice and other practice in relation
thereto. While the Committee, on the basis of the terms of Procedural Order No. 1 agreed
by the Parties, did not reject the introduction of expert reports per se, that does not imply
a (positive) decision in relation to the probative value of these reports, in particular where

they contain new arguments exceeding the scope of annulment.

194. Spain seeks to justify the fact that it submitted expert evidence by arguing that “this
report” (and presumably Prof. Gosalbo’s second report) demonstrate that the lack of
jurisdiction “is not the result of a capricious interpretation by the Kingdom of Spain, but
is the logical consequence of the application of the basic principles of European Union
law.”?'5 This, however, is circular reasoning and does not outweigh the fact that the

Committee is limited by the arguments and evidence before the Tribunal. These Expert

Reports cannot, therefore, constitute an independent basis for any finding of this
Committee in so far as these reports contain new arguments not made in the underlying

arbitration.

195. Insofar as Spain relies on substantive arguments that formed part of the Tribunal’s and
therefore the Committee’s remit, the Committee will address these below in their most

logical sequence and structure.

Article 26 ECT

s

196. As considered by the Tribunal and effectively accepted by both Parties,”!® the starting
point of the analysis as to whether Article 26 ECT bestows jurisdiction on the Tribunal,
pursuant to Article 31 VCLT, is the text of Article 26 ECT, which is clear and provides
that an investor may submit for resolution “[d]isputes between a Contracting Party and
an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the
Area of the former.” The text refers to Contracting Parties in general and does not
distinguish between different classes of Contracting Parties. As the Tribunal further

99217

considered: “the literal meaning leaves no doubts”*"’ as to the ECT’s jurisdictional remit.

197. Spain seeks to show that despite the unambiguous text of Article 26 ECT, in its context
and in the light of the ECT’s object and purpose, the Tribunal exceeded its powers by
accepting jurisdiction. As stated above, this argument appears to be augmented in the
course of these annulment proceedings, including by means of the newly introduced
reference to customary international law. In the arbitration, Spain’s argument centered
on the alleged implicit disconnection clause that should be read into Article 26 ECT, an
argument that will be addressed below in Section V.C.2.e. In the annulment proceedings,
Spain expanded its argument by stressing that the ECT “was not designed to comprise

the settlement of disputes between different members of the European Union”,?!® and

54

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 65 of 169

that the principle of primacy and the literal application of the phrase REIO were ignored

by the Tribunal.?!°

d. REIO

198. Spain’s REIO argument appears somewhat inconsistent. In its Memorial, it submits that
the terms Investor, Contracting Party and Area referred to in Article 26 ECT and in turn
defined in Article 1 ECT, in light of the context, the object and purpose of the ECT as
an instrument of the external policy of the EU, and the circumstances of the conclusion
of the ECT, the ordinary meaning of these provisions must be understood as excluding
EU investors investing in the area of the EU. It also argues that the REIO concept in the
ECT was specifically created, inter alia, to address the special nature of the EU as a
single market.””° In its Reply, however, and at the Hearing, Spain asserts that a /iteral
approach to Article 26 ECT justifies the conclusion that intra-EU disputes are excluded
from the scope of Article 26 ECT because of the lack of diversity of the Contracting

Parties.77!

199. First, the Committee notes that presenting this argument as a literal interpretation of
Article 26 in conjunction with Article 1 ECT is unsustainable. As Cube and Demeter
submit, the definitions of “REIO” and “Territory” of an REIO in Articles 1(3) and 1(10)
of the ECT contain no language affecting the ability of Investors of EU Member States
to commence arbitration against other EU Member States. Instead, the ECT merely
states as a definitional matter that some Contracting Parties are members of regional

organizations, which are simply defined terms.”

200. Further consideration of the text of other provisions of the Convention does not support
Spain’s view. The ECT could have stipulated that where an investor from one
Contracting Party initiates a dispute against another Contracting Party, and both are

within a REIO as Member States of the EU, their separate status as Contracting Parties

is no longer recognized as they are replaced by or subsumed under the REIO to which
they belong which is also a party to the ECT. However, it does not so stipulate, and in
the absence of wording to this effect, the Committee considers that the constituent State
parties do not, under the terms of the ECT, lose their status as Contracting Party by virtue
of the fact that the regional organization of which they are a member has also signed the
ECT.

201.

Respondents explain at some length that other tribunals have addressed the wording of
Article 26 ECT and have concluded, like the Tribunal, that nothing in the text of Article
26 itself suggests that its scope was intended to be restricted to disputes involving either
an Investor or a Contracting Party outside the EU,” and that the argument of the
historical context now raised by Spain was not advanced in the underlying arbitration.?*4
Spain has not rebutted Respondents’ allegation that in the underlying arbitration Spain
never raised this line of argument based on the definition of “REIO” and “Area.”
Moreover, the Committee notes that, as stated above in Section IV.C, also within these
annulment proceedings, Spain’s arguments have developed and changed. This is
particularly visible in and apparently due to the introduction of the (new) Expert Reports

of Prof. Gosalbo.

202. The arguments raised by Spain in relation to the REIO concept contained in the ECT,
and the intention of the parties (or at least the EU Member State parties to the ECT) in
relation to the alleged carve out of certain disputes from the scope of Article 26 ECT,
are made with respect to the disconnection clause argument which will be separately
addressed below. At this stage, the Committee concludes that even if the REIO-
argument is entitled to consideration at this annulment phase, which is questionable
given the very limited scope of Spain’s reliance on it in the underlying arbitration, this
argument does not support Spain’s position. The text of Article 26 ECT is clear, also in
respect of any alleged carve out of certain categories of disputes. As the Tribunal

determined: “the regime of Article 26(1) ECT applies to all Contracting Parties. No

223 C-Mem., § 144.
224 C-Mem., 145.
25 C-Mem., 153.

56

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 67 of 169

Contracting Parties are excluded from that regime. The only requirement is that the
investor must be of another nationality than the State Party charged with a violation of

its duties under the ECT.”

e. Disconnection clause

203. Related to Spain’s argument that given the EU’s status as a REIO, disputes involving the
EU Member States and their Investors must be treated differently from other Contracting
Parties and their Investors, is the argument that the EU effectively introduced a
disconnection clause into the ECT. This argument is interwoven with the primacy
argument which was addressed in the underlying arbitration at some length, and which
is based on the scope of, and alleged impact of, Article 26(6) ECT and whether the
reference to applicable rules and principles of international law incorporates and imposes

the application of EU law to determine jurisdiction.??”

204. Before addressing that broader issue, the Committee reiterates that the starting point of
the analysis of Article 26 ECT is the text of the provision and the explicit restrictions
contained in the ECT. Notably, as the Tribunal considered in its Decision, the ECT
explicitly addresses the eventuality of conflict between the Svalbard Treaty and the ECT
and provides that that Svalbard Treaty shall prevail in case of a conflict with the ECT.??

No such provision was made to restrict the application to the ECT in relation to the EU

or its Member States.””? It is incongruous that the ECT Member States had agreed on

an explicit carve out for disputes involving the 9 February 1920 Spitsbergen Treaty

(Svalbard Treaty), but that the carve out for the EU should be read into the ECT

implicitly. The fact that the EU itself is a member of the ECT and could have raised its

desire to include a similar carve out, only reinforces the inability to read in a limitation

comparable to the Svalbard Treaty.

57

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 68 of 169

205. By reference to Prof. Gosalbo’s Expert Report, who in turn refers to a text proposal made
by the EU, Spain seeks now to bolster its argument that a carve out should be read into
Article 26 ECT as a result of the failed attempt of the European Commission to include
an explicit disconnection clause into the ECT.**° In addition, Spain raises the new
argument that the Lisbon Treaty introduced an implicit disconnection clause in the ECT,

for which Respondents assert there is no basis.?*!

206. Even more so than in relation to the REIO-argument, it is clear that Spain has introduced
new arguments with respect to the disconnection clause, including argumentation which
in turn relies on new expert evidence and new supportive documentation. As considered
in paragraph 95 above, a committee’s remit is to “restrict itself to a review of the
underlying Award and the process followed by the original Tribunal, which necessarily
entails limiting its review to the record before the original Tribunal.””>? The Committee
is mindful that in formulating its grounds for annulment, an applicant will convey its
arguments in the most comprehensive way possible and some flexibility is therefore
appropriate in reviewing the phrasing of any particular argument. At the same time, the
nature of annulment is that of an exceptional and narrow remedy, and the introduction
of novel arguments is inconsistent with these attributes. The need to verify the scope of
the initial debate also obscures the primary role of a committee, namely to review the

annulment grounds.

207. Consequently, newly raised arguments exceeding the scope of arguments made in the
underlying arbitration will not be considered by the Committee. Furthermore, in relation
to the disconnection clause, the Committee finds that even if the newly introduced
arguments are taken into consideration, they do not support Spain’s position, but rather
the opposite. The failure to include an explicit disconnection clause, where the relevant
treaty contains an explicit carve out for other disputes, discredits the notion of implicit
carve out. This is compounded by the fact that European Commission sought and failed

to obtain an explicit disconnection clause: not only objectively, in the sense that it belies

58

the suggestion of the ability to read in implicit wording, but also subjectively, in the
sense that the failure to achieve such clause should have put the EU on notice that the

limitation it was seeking could not implicitly be read into the text of the ECT.

Sf Primacy

208. Spain further addresses the argument that relates to the relationship between EU law and
other sources and bodies of law, notably the ECT, and the significance of the alleged
primacy of EU law. Spain invoked Article 26(6) ECT which provides that “[a] tribunal
established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this

Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.”

209. Spain argues that if Article 26 ECT were interpreted to cover intra-EU disputes, such an
interpretation would conflict with the EU Treaties, and that conflict, as a matter of
international law, must be resolved in favor of EU law.?*? It argues that the primacy of
EU law isa special conflict rule under international law.* At the Hearing, Spain argued
that the impact of Article 26(6) ECT “means treating EU law and applicable international

law on equal terms when it comes to resolving the dispute.”?>>

210. While the exact presentation and formulation of the argument varies somewhat in
Spain’s various submissions, it is a core building block of its case and it goes to the

essence of the dispute.

211. Spain argues that as matter of EU law, EU law has priority over the national law of the
Member States. As a corollary thereof, Article 267 of the TFEU contains a mechanism
for ensuring the harmonious application of EU law within the EU. And finally, Spain
adds that Article 344 of the TFEU prohibits Member States from submitting a dispute
concerning the interpretation or application of EU treaties to a method of dispute
settlement other than their national courts.”*° As a matter of international law, it is the

view of the Committee that EU law does not have primacy, and this view extends to

situations such as in the present case where an Investor from one EU Member State
invokes the ECT as the basis of a claim against another EU Member State. As the
Tribunal considered “[w]ithin the system of international law, EU law does not have
supremacy ...”°>7 Spain’s arguments do not affect the conclusion that as a matter of
international law, EU law does not have primacy. The provisions invoked by Spain are
provisions of EU law and their scope and relevance must be determined insofar as EU
law is applicable and relevant. They do not serve as a means of elevating EU law and
equating it with international law. Insofar as the interpretation of the ECT is concerned,
this is not a question to be addressed at the level of EU law. As a multilateral treaty, the
ECT and the determination of the scope of jurisdiction of disputes submitted on the basis

thereof is to be determined on the basis of international law.

212. Furthermore, as the Tribunal considered, the fact that the ECT Contracting Parties did
not agree that EU legal rules take precedence over any incompatible rules of whatever
other source, and that the ECT jurisdictional clause would become inapplicable should
any inconsistency be found, is rebutted by Article 16(2) ECT. This provision establishes
that the ECT Member States, including the EU, agreed the contrary (“nothing in such
terms of the other agreement shall be construed to derogate from any provision of Part
III or V of this Treaty or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under

this Treaty”).758

213. Respondents moreover correctly refer to Article 216 of the TFEU, which provides that
“Agreements concluded by the Union are binding upon the institutions of the Union and
on its Member States.” Rather than supporting the notion of primacy, the EU treaties
themselves mandate Spain to apply and comply with the ECT, as an international

agreement.???

214. The Tribunal also considered that the ECT Parties could have agreed expressly to give

different treatment to the EU and its Member States in relation to the matters relevant to

215.

the present dispute, as they have done in Article 25 ECT in relation to certain matters not
relevant to this dispute; but, as the Tribunal observed, the ECT Parties did not do so.7“°
In its Reply, for what would appear to be the first time, Spain invokes Article 25 ECT,
but in support for its position that the ECT recognizes the primacy of EU law.”*! This
argument is surprisingly introduced late in the proceedings and is undisputedly novel
which would justify its rejection for purposes of these annulment proceedings. Article
25 ECT deals with economic integration agreements (“EIAs”) and provides that the ECT
shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting Party which is party to an EIA to bestow
on other ECT Member States most-favored-nation treatment based on that EIA. This
provision allows the EU to limit preferences that would otherwise have been available
to non-EU Member States but parties to the ECT on the basis of most-favored-nation
treatment among the EU Member States. Rather than supporting Spain’s case this

provision detracts from it.

Finally, in another new argument raised for the first time in the annulment proceedings,
Spain argues that Article 351 TFEU triggers the /ex posterior rule of treaty interpretation,
rendering the ECT inapplicable to the EU Member States.”4? This argument has been
addressed by a number of other tribunals who have rejected the notion that this provision

should apply as a conflict rule,?*

and rather supports the notion that the ECT does
provide jurisdiction because Article 16(2) ECT confirms the applicability of jurisdiction
pursuant to the ECT where any such provision is more favorable to the Investor or

Investment. ”“4

216. The fact that this argument is newly raised and not rebutted, appears to be the result of
the introduction of a new line of argumentation undertaken by Spain’s expert, precludes
the Committee from comprehensively reviewing Spain’s arguments in relation to Article
351 TFEU. However, the Committee reiterates its considerations above at
paragraph 212, that the Tribunal expressly considered the impact of Article 16(2) ECT
and held that the ECT Contracting Parties did not agree that EU legal rules take
precedence over any incompatible rules of whatever source, so that the ECT
jurisdictional clause would become inapplicable should any inconsistency be found.?45
Given this express finding and the failure to invoke the argument which in any event has
been rejected by other tribunals, the Committee fails to see how the reference to Article
351 TFEU and the alleged failure to apply this provision in the way proposed by Spain

and Prof. Gosalbo can constitute an excess of powers, let alone of a manifest nature.

g. Achmea judgment

217. In further support of its arguments that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction, Spain
invokes the ECJ’s Achmea decision. The Committee notes that to some extent Spain’s
argument is circular as it is prefaced on the notion that EU law comes into play. As
stated above, the Tribunal’s review of jurisdiction and any alleged excess of powers in
accepting jurisdiction must be reviewed on the basis of the ECT and the rules of
international law. Furthermore, the Achmea decision involves a number of issues and
considerations, which Spain also addresses separately, such as the notion that Article 267
TFEU is one of the cornerstones of the EU judicial system,”“° and which this Committee

addresses separately.

218. The Committee notes that Spain’s reference to iura novit curia does not affect this
conclusion.”4” First, the Tribunal extensively discussed the Achmea judgment and came
to the conclusion that the case’s specifics make “it inapposite as a precedent for the

present proceedings.”?“* Spain disagrees with the Tribunal’s analysis and outcome, but

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 73 of 169

there can be no doubt that the Tribunal considered the Achmea judgment and its potential
implications. Second, the notion of iura novit curia and its role in international
arbitration, and in particular in investment and ICSID arbitration, is not without
complications and limitations, including in particular the limitations imposed by the

ICSID annulment system.

219. The Tribunal distinguished the judgment carefully and at some length. It explained that
Achmea related to a bilateral investment treaty providing for arbitration with the seat in
Germany, and the ECJ explicitly caveated its consideration relating to Articles 267 and
344 TFEU by pointing out that the relevant jurisdictional provision was contained in an
agreement between Member States. The Tribunal noted that the ECJ also confirmed that
dispute settlement mechanisms in international treaties are not in principle incompatible
with EU law. The governing law provision in Achmea involved a requirement for the
tribunal to interpret the national law of a Member State, and finally, the ECJ considered
that the German-Slovak BIT was not concluded by the EU but by the relevant Member
States. The Committee sees no basis for questioning this reasoning, let alone concluding

that in drawing its conclusions, the Tribunal exceeded its powers.

220. As Respondents point out, dozens of other ECT tribunals have reached the same
conclusion as the Tribunal.”#? Spain refers to one source which argues that the reasoning
of the Achmea judgment was followed, namely the ECJ’s Opinion 1/17 in relation to the
dispute settlement mechanism in CETA. Respondents submit and the Committee agrees
with the position that this document postdates the Cube Award and therefore falls outside
the scope of review by the Committee.*° Similarly, Spain’s reference to subsequent
documents not part of the record before the Tribunal cannot be entertained by the
Committee (namely the EC’s 2018 Communication in relation to Achmea, and the 2019

Declarations by certain Member States).

(3) EU Law Applicable to the Merits

221. The Tribunal, in its Decision, addressed the law applicable to the merits of the case in
the context of its discussion of the Achmea judgment, and concluded that pursuant to
Article 26(6) ECT the applicable law is international law, particularly the ECT.**! This
is one of the bases on which it distinguished the present case from the Achmea case,
which required the tribunal to take account the law of the Contracting State, and thus EU
law. In that context the Tribunal also made some references to rules against State aid,
which it referred to as EU secondary legislation, and which cannot be considered
principles of international law within the meaning of Article 26(6) ECT.” Furthermore,
it considered that while the EU treaties are international agreements and governed by
public international law they do not constitute “principles of international law” within
the meaning of Article 26(6) ECT.?* The Tribunal concluded that while Spanish law
and EU law are relevant as facts, provisions on EU law concerning State aid are not
applied by the Tribunal, and nor does the Tribunal make any decision on their

interpretation.?*+

222. What this overview of the Tribunal’s Decision demonstrates is that the context of the
Tribunal’s discussion of the law applicable to the merits was that of the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. The considerations regarding the applicable law as well as the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction were based on and interwoven with the (rejection of) the argument that by
virtue of Article 26(6) ECT and the alleged applicability or even primacy of EU law the
unqualified attribution of jurisdiction pursuant to Article 26(1) ECT should be restricted.
In the annulment proceedings, the Parties have vigorously debated whether and if so to
what extent Spain raised the argument that EU law should be deemed applicable to the

merits of the case, as distinct from the attribution of jurisdiction in the underlying

251 RL-0093, Decision, § 156.
252 RL-0093, Decision, § 159.

arbitration. Specifically, Spain submits that it invoked the applicability of EU law to the

merits of the case in its post hearing brief.7*>

223. Even if this passage in the post hearing brief contains some reference to the substantive
law argument, as Spain argues, it does not have the scope or the breath of the argument

as raised in the annulment.

224. First, the Committee notes that the issue of the applicable law was also primarily argued
in relation to jurisdiction in the annulment proceeding. The arguments made under that
heading do not fundamentally differ from the arguments discussed above particularly in
relation to the issue of the alleged primacy of EU law.*°° Second, while the scope of
argument in the underlying arbitration may be debated, in the annulment there can be no
doubt that Spain develops it as an independent line of argument based on the law
applicable to the merits of the case, which considerably exceeds the scope of its argument
in the underlying arbitration. Spain’s argument in the underlying arbitration was that
Spain’s price support scheme should be characterized as impermissible State aid under
EU rules. Given the actual decision of the Tribunal, however, which did address State
aid as such, it is not entirely clear what Spain’s interest is in raising this argument or
issue under the heading “applicable law” and whether it is in fact seeking a
reconsideration of the Tribunal’s (substantive) decision. There is no clear indication that
Spain’s arguments would have been more effective or persuasive so as to justify a
different outcome if the issue of State aid were reviewed on a different legal basis, let
alone whether within the scope of the annulment this would constitute a manifest excess

of powers.

225. The Tribunal held that “the obligations regarding State aid were incumbent upon the
Respondent, and investors are entitled to assume that they had been taken into account
by the Respondent when drafting its legislation. It was not for the Claimants to second-

guess the Respondent’s legislature.”?*’ On that basis, the Tribunal concluded that “the

255 Reply, 4127.

257 RL-0093, Decision, § 306.

65

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 76 of 169

provisions of EU law and State aid do not weaken the Claimants’ entitlement to rely, at
the time that they make their investments, upon the representations made in the

Respondent’s regulatory scheme.”?**

226. The key element of Spain’s augmented argument relates to the 2017 Decision on State
Aid. Spain argues that the Tribunal should have addressed the 2017 Decision on State
Aid and use it as a basis to come to a different conclusion than it did because the rules
on State aid are to be found in Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU, and thus treaty law.°°
Spain seeks to support this argument further by arguing in its reply at the Hearing on
Annulment that “the Tribunal did not apply EU law, which, even without Spain's
argument, it should have applied on the basis of the iura novit curia principle.”?° Cube
and Demeter, on the other hand, emphasized that the Tribunal did consider Spain’s
position and that while it rejected the relevance of EU State aid law as part of the
governing law of the dispute, it did acknowledge that EU law, including State aid law
was relevant as part of the factual background of the dispute. As to the 2017 EC State
Aid Decision, Cube and Demeter argue that the Tribunal was not required explicitly to
refer to this, and moreover that it relates to the current and not the incentive program

under which Cube and Demeter invested.?°!

227. In essence, what Spain seeks is a review and reassessment of the Tribunal’s substantive
finding that the provisions of EU law and State aid do not impact Cube and Demeter’s
entitlement to rely, at the time they made their investments, on the representations made
under Spain’s regulatory regime. The most concrete argument Spain makes to support
this reassessment is the reference to the 2017 EC State Aid Decision, on which the
Tribunal sought the Parties’ submissions but did not refer to explicitly in its reasoning
and decision. It is undisputed that this Decision relates to a different investment regime.

It is not for the Committee to second guess the Tribunal’s reasons for not explicitly

including a reference to this 2017 EC State Decision (see also VI.C(2)c in reference to

Ground II), but the fact that it relates to a different regime seems an ample explanation.

In any event, it is not appropriate and certainly not within the scope of an annulment
committee’s remit when reviewing whether a tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers to
consider what, if certain provisions of law had been applicable and applied (and the
Committee notes that it is not obvious that this was the case), would have happened ifa
particular piece of Spanish legislation (in this case RD 661/2007) had been notified to
the EC and what then the impact would have been on investors’ expectations.? That is

not a matter of applying the law; that is speculation.

(4) Manifest Excess — Conclusion

. Spain’s argumentation in support of the alleged “manifest” nature of the Tribunal’s
excess of powers largely consists of a number of general arguments that go to the
substance of the dispute. In particular, Spain argues that the Tribunal should have been
well aware of the nature of the dispute and that it involved an intra-EU character, and
that Spain had invoked the intra-EU objection from the outset. It also seeks to strengthen
the manifest nature of the Tribunal’s excess of powers by reference to the Tribunal’s

failure to allow the EC to intervene.7®

Cube and Demeter, on the other hand, in addition to disputing that Spain’s substantive
arguments constitute an excessive power (let alone manifest excess of power), emphasize
that the so-called intra-EU exception has never been accepted by the large number of

tribunals who have addressed this issue.?*

As the Committee considered at the outset, the question whether the “manifest” test
requires a two-step analysis or a prima facie approach is of limited significance where,

as is the case here, a committee finds that there is no excess.

67

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 78 of 169

232. The Committee recognizes that it is indeed clear, as Spain submits, that it was apparent
from the outset that Spain was invoking the intra-EU nature of the dispute as a basis for
rejecting the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. At the same time, as the Committee has considered
in relation to many of Spain’s concrete arguments, Spain’s arguments have changed and
have been significantly augmented over time throughout the original proceeding and the
annulment proceedings. It is not apparent to the Committee that the alleged
notoriousness of the nature of the dispute would serve to support the manifest nature of
any excess of powers committed by the Tribunal. Rather, it was the Tribunal’s task to

decide the dispute before it on the basis of the arguments submitted by the Parties.

233. The Committee also recognizes that, for Spain, the intra-EU nature and the intra-EU
objection is a critical issue. This recognition notwithstanding, it does not justify the
conclusion that a tribunal’s decision should be reconsidered by an annulment committee,

as an annulment procedure is not an appeal.

234. Cube and Demeter’s reference to the consistent rejection of the intra-EU objection serves
a different purpose and goes to the merits of the arguments raised in this case and in
numerous others. While the Committee will not go so far as to say that the mere fact
that many or indeed all other tribunals faced with these questions have come to a result
in line with the Tribunal, and that therefore there is no need to go further to find an excess
of power, which has found broad support by other tribunals for the interpretation
embraced by the Tribunal reinforces the conclusion that there is no excess of powers, let

alone of a manifest nature.

235. To conclude, this ground of the Application must fail.

VI. FAILURE TO STATE REASONS

A. THE APPLICANT’S ARGUMENTS
(1) Applicable Legal Standard

236. Spain argues that an award should be annulled “if it has not stated the reasons on which
it is based” in accordance with Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.” Spain
further submits that pursuant to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, the “tribunal

must address all issues referred to it, and indicate the reasons on which it bases its

conclusions.”?°7

237. Spain submits that annulment committees have decided that, at a minimum, a ruling must
allow a reader to “follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B.”?

Particularly, the supporting reasons “must constitute an appropriate foundation for the

conclusions.”?°

238. Spain alleges that the task of a committee is to determine whether there has been a
comprehensive and consistent reasoning that a reader can follow.?”? Spain argues that

there is a need for a party to be able to understand the ruling because it is precisely the
“statement of reasons and guarantees procedural legitimacy and validity.”?”!
Additionally, the Applicant contends that committees have clarified that insufficient and

inadequate reasons as well as contradictory reasons can lead to the annulment of an

award.?”? Spain adds that there has to be sufficient and adequate reasons which are not

contradictory or frivolous.?”

239. Finally, Spain argues that Articles 48(3) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention impose
the obligation on tribunals to address all issues, arguments and evidence presented. In

that sense, a “failure to deal a particular matter submitted to it” or to “address certain

relevant evidence” amounts to a failure to state reasons that would result in annulment.”

Spain supports this argument by reference to the MINE and TECO annulment decisions
where the committees decided to annul the damages section because the tribunal did not
address certain arguments raised by a party or because the tribunal ignored the existence

in the record of evidence.”

(2) Failure to State Reasons in Determining the Applicable Law and Conclusions
on State Aid

a. Failure to explain that EU law was deemed not applicable

243. Spain points out that it invoked the application of EU law to both the substance of the
dispute as well as to the determination of jurisdiction in the underlying arbitration.
During the Hearing, Spain also raised the issue that the Tribunal did not specifically
address the applicable law in a separate section but rather as part of the arguments on the
intra-EU objection.”*° Spain argues that the Tribunal implicitly accepted the importance
of EU law because it rejected its relevance for the resolution of the substance of the case
on two occasions. ”*”

244. Spain argues that although the Tribunal seems to acknowledge that treaties of the EU are
“rules of international law” within the meaning of Article 26(6) ECT,?* it incorrectly
rejected the argument that State aid amounts to international law. According to Spain,
the Tribunal was incorrect in holding that “the submissions before us do not suggest that
the EU treaties are directly applicable to these proceedings; and while the rules
established by EU secondary legislation — such as rules against State aid — are EU law,
they plainly cannot be ‘principles of international law’ within the meaning of Article
26(6) ECT.”?8° The Applicant argues that the last part in the Tribunal’s holding
concerning the “principles of international law” was not an argument raised by Spain in

0

the underlying arbitration.”"° The Applicant further argues that “accepting that EU

treaties can be categorized in any other concept but as rules of international law is

accepting that in the decision making process arbitrariness is allowed even with regard

to the principle of iura novit curia.”””!

b. Lack of reasoning why Articles 107 and 108 TFEU were not applied

245. Spain argues that the Tribunal failed to explain why, after qualifying EU treaties as
international law, it did not apply these EU treaties regulating State aid (Articles 107 and

108 of the TFEU) to the merits of the case thus contradicting itself. 7°?

246. Spain supports its argument by noting that the Tribunal further contradicted itself by
considering that the Parties did not suggest that EU treaties were applicable to these
proceedings when Spain frequently invoked Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU in its

submissions. 7%

c. European Commission’s reasoning in the State aid decision not assessed

247. The Applicant also contends that the Tribunal ignored the EC Decision on State Aid?™*

and did not provide any reasons for not addressing it in its ruling.?°>

(3) Failure to State Reasons for the Conclusions on Liability
a. FET standard in Article 10(1) ECT

248. On the FET standard contained in Article 10(1) ECT, Spain submits that the Tribunal
does not provide reasons in support of its finding of a breach resulting from treatment

that is unfair and inequitable.*°° According to Spain, the Tribunal contradicted itself

later on in its ruling which is also basis for annulment.?””

249. Spain argues that the Tribunal did not explain how it arrived at the elements that
constitute legitimate expectations. According to Spain, the Tribunal also contradicted

itself by first saying that legitimate expectations had to be justified, rational and

reasonable, and then stating that the way in which the understanding of the representation

on which the expectation is based is secondary.”°*

250. Spain asserts that the Tribunal conclusion had a contradiction; that “the regulatory power
of the State and binding the obligations derived from guaranteeing a FET fundamentally
to the obligation of stability, without stability being in any way equated to the
petrification of the system.”?°? According to Spain, this is the basis of the Tribunal’s
failure to state reasons that “[t]he Decision does not incorporate a sufficiently clear
reasoning for the Parties to know why, if the State retains regulatory power to
accommodate regulation in the economic situation for reasons of general interest (Point
A), a State could not, for those same reasons, significantly modify the regulation, altering
essential characteristics of the regulation (Point B).”?°°

251. Regarding the Tribunal conclusion that the FET obligation does not imply petrification,
Spain argues that the Tribunal considered the economic impact of the changes (without
any analysis of the particular impact of the Disputed Measures)*°! and concluded that if
the “promise” was not clear, it gave “rise to legitimate expectations of petrification.”*°”

In doing so, Spain argues that the Tribunal failed to analyze the effects and damage of

the measures, or at least should have made an analysis of the effects and the alteration of

the ‘economic basis.’>°

>

Lack of valid reasoning for violation of legitimate expectations

252. Spain argues that the four elements of the Tribunal’s decision on the breach of Article

10(1) of the FET are “supported by a series of considerations made by the Tribunal where

multiple contradictions and failures or gaps in the reasoning are appreciated.”>°*

(i) First element: Supposed immutability in RD 661/2007

253. On the first element, the supposed commitment on immutability contained in RD
661/2007,°°5 Spain argues that the Tribunal was manifestly wrong when referring to RD
661/2007 as a rule “with the force of law when it is a regulatory norm that emanates from

the Government” that “complements or develops Laws and is hierarchically inferior to

>>306

them’ and “can never contradict the higher ranking Laws.”*°” Spain further argues

that the Tribunal did not “explain how a rule that is inferior to an Act... can be expected
to petrify the entire legal system...”°°°
254. Spain supports its argument that the Tribunal’s reasons are contradictory by pointing out

that in some parts the Tribunal recognizes the “clear and specific” commitment to the

Special Regime,* while in other parts it expressly admits that “661/2007 does not
exclude changes to in the remuneration system for support to renewable energies.”>!°
The Applicant further argues that the Tribunal did not address an essential aspect of
Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, “namely the wording of the article itself (“[t]he reviews

referred to in this section of the regulated tariff...’).”>"'

regulatory changes for the hydroelectric plants in its ruling.*'* According to Spain, the

procure legal advice from Spanish counsel, even though no detailed written opinion was filed in these proceedings.
Third, the Respondent has not shown that any more exhaustive legal analysis would have produced any different
understanding of the Spanish measures. Fourth, the significance of the Respondent’s representations as to the stability
of RD 661/2007 is ultimately not a matter of Spanish law but of international law, operating in the context of Article
10(1) ECT.”). See also, Reply, $4] 330-356.

Tribunal did not provide any reasoning either to reject or admit the regulatory changes
made prior to Cube and Demeter’s investment “despite the fact it was extensively dealt

with in the arbitration.”33

256. Spain alleges that the Tribunal “failed to make a truly comprehensive analysis of the

legal regime of the country in which the Claimants invested, which should have begun
with a review of the content of the Electricity Sector Act [Law 54/1997].”3!4 With
respect to the principle of economic sustainability, Spain notes that the Tribunal did not
make any mention of examples of legislation that enshrine this principle, nor did the
Tribunal explain “why it was not expected that on the basis of this principle, the

necessary measures would be taken to avoid the collapse of the system.” *!°

points out that the Tribunal’s decision omitted to indicate that the reasonable return rate

was “not limited to Article 44 of RD 661/2007 but is imposed by Article 30(4) of the

Electricity Sector Act ... and reiterated by constant Supreme Court jurisprudence.”?!”

The Applicant further submits that the principle of reasonable return “is not simply a

limit, as the Decision states, but a guarantee for investors in the Spanish renewable

(ii) Second element: Press Release

258. On the second element, the Press Release, Spain argues that it was also the subject of
contradictions and obscurities when it was analyzed by the Tribunal.*?° When the
Tribunal referred to the Press Release, it once again confused RD 661/2007 with a Jaw
and equated it to an independent source of legitimate expectations.*”! Spain points to a
contradiction by the Tribunal when, “on one hand, it admits that Article 44(3) of RD
661/2007 does not exclude any modification of the regime but, on the other hand, it ...
excludes the retrospective modification of the regime.” **? Likewise, the Tribunal’s

considerations regarding “stability” in relation to the Press Release, clash.*”

259. According to Spain, there are instances in the Tribunal’s ruling that “one cannot be sure
whether in the eyes of the Decision the Press Release is an autonomous source of
commitment to stability, or a mere glossary of RD 661/2007, or can complement and
make explicit what RD 661/2007 does not say, or can never say anything different from

what RD 661/2007 supposedly expresses.” >74

260. Spain alleges that the Tribunal omitted to address particular issues of the Press Release
in its ruling such as the fact that it was not signed or that it was on the website of the
Government or Council of Ministers and not on the Ministry of Industry.**> Spain also
refers to the fact that press releases are merely informative and do not have any legal

value, also a point that was not addressed by the Tribunal according to Spain.?”°

(iii) Third element: Due Diligence

261. The third element, according to Spain, is the absence of due diligence by Cube and

understanding as of the date of the investments.*?” Spain invokes the lack of analysis by
the Tribunal of the understanding of the Spanish regulatory measures at the time that
Cube and Demeter made their investments and the lack of evidence in the record as to
any due diligence on regulatory risk.*?* Even though Cube and Demeter claimed Article
44(3) of RD 661/2007 as a fundamental part of their case, Spain stresses that the Tribunal

admitted that there was no due diligence that would indicate the understanding of Article

44(3) at the moment of Cube and Demeter’s investment. *”?

262. Spain notes that the “lack of an evidentiary element of such relevance to support the

reasonability of such (alleged) expectations, should result in demerit of the Claimants in

99330

the underlying arbitration proceeding. More so, Spain adds, “against the most

elementary rules of the burden of proof... the Decision turns around the rules of the

burden of proof and weighs on the Kingdom of Spain the negative consequences of such

lack of proof.”*3!

263. According to Spain, a more thorough analysis of the evidence in the proceeding would

332

have produced a different understanding of the Spanish measures. The Applicant

argues that the Tribunal did not offer valid reasons to resolve contradictions. Spain
highlights the Tribunal’s contradictions in relation to (i) the understanding of the changes
in the regulatory regime within the considerations of the Decision, *** (ii) the case law of
the Supreme Court which demonstrated that at the time of making the investments no
investor could have a greater expectation than a reasonable return as provided in Article

30(4) of Law 54/1997 and entailed no petrification of the remuneration system,*** (iii)

for legitimate expectations. Spain adds that if the Tribunal intended “by citing article
10(1) ECT [sic] as a separate source in support of legitimate expectations, ... to establish
it as an autonomous source of expectations, it would be departing, without any reason,
from the arbitral precedents that indicate that such article is not in itself a stabilization

clause.”338

s

Content of legitii ex ions and the of the di: 1

Spain then turns to discuss the legitimate expectations and the Tribunal’s assessment of
the Disputed Measures (i.e. RD 1565/2010, RDL Law 14/2010, Law 15/2012, RDL
2/2013, RDL 9/2013, Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014 and Ministerial Order 1045/2014).>*°
Spain recalls that Cube and Demeter claimed the violation of the ECT by Spain for all

of these Disputed Measures as a whole.*4°

According to Spain, when the Tribunal turned to the analysis of the FET with respect to
the Disputed Measures, it did not clearly outline what the content of the legitimate
expectations were, nor did it analyze each of the Disputed Measures in the light of the
FET standard that it had set out.*#! Spain refers to ambiguities and contradictions in the
Tribunal’s analysis pointing out that “evidently it is not the same to allude as a parameter
to the immutability of the system, as to allude to the possibility of changes, and even the
parameters of ‘radicality’ and ‘harm’ are not the same, as the Decision itself admits.”*+
Spain notes that the Tribunal considered certain measures “not to be contrary to [Article].
10 ECT because they did not alter ‘the economic basis on which the investment was

999343

made while considering that others had an economic impact.*#* In making this

decision, Spain adds, the Tribunal did not provide any reasoning why it understood that

those measures did not alter the ‘economic base’ of the investment,*4> why this

‘alteration of the economic base’ should be understood as a parameter,*#° or on what

basis the Tribunal considered the two disputed measures to be ‘radical’ changes.*4”

268. The Tribunal’s reasoning supporting the radical changes particularly with respect to the
introduction of the principle of reasonable return, Spain notes, was not supported in any

exhibit or evidentiary material in the record.*4*

(4) Failure to State Reasons for the Quantification of Damages

269. Spain also alleges that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons, and was also inconsistent,
when “calculating the compensation due, both in relation to photovoltaic plants and in
relation to hydroelectric installations.”*? Spain explains that it is difficult to follow the
decision of the Tribunal with respect to the determination of damages because the

Tribunal failed to specify or justify the legitimate expectations of the investors.**°

a. Photovoltaic facilities

270. According to Spain, the Tribunal’s decision regarding the damages with respect to the
photovoltaic plants contradicts its own decision on liability.**! Spain explains that while
the Tribunal decided that the measures after July 2013 were the ones that had an

economic impact, the final damages awarded were only 26% of the total damages

352

initially claimed by Cube and Demeter.*°* For Spain, this does not follow the ‘radical’

change decided by the Tribunal.

b. Hydroelectric installations

271. With respect to the hydroelectric installations,*** Spain argues that the Tribunal “used a
methodology to apply the regulatory risk that lacked any basis.”*°* The Respondents’
expert understood that the risk was higher in the Actual Scenario than in the But For
Scenario while Spain’s expert understood that since the Disputed Measures restored the
financial situation of the electricity sector, the Actual Scenario was less risky than the

But For Scenario.

272. According to the Applicant, the Tribunal “ignored the methodology proposed by the two
experts in relation to regulatory risk and preferred to apply its own methodology, despite
the fact that it had not been alleged or discussed by the Parties to the proceedings. Thus,
without any reasoning, the Tribunal held that a ‘reasonable’ approach would be to reduce
the difference between the projected cash flows in the Prevailing Scenario and the But
For Scenario by 40%.”>°> Spain argues that the experts “had agreed that regulatory risk
should be calculated by applying a ‘revenue haircut’ to revenue projections, i.e. that
projected revenues should be reduced to reflect the likelihood that financial support for
the plants might disappear. When affecting plant revenues, the adjustment of the
projections was done at a firm level and therefore before considering the payment of any

interest or debt.”35°

273. In its Reply, Spain further argues that the Award reached a contradictory position on
damages with respect to the Decision. According to Spain, “[w]hile it clearly intended
that hydroelectric investments would be subject to a higher degree of regulatory risk due
to the later investment date in 2011, it actually applied a 51% discount, a lower discount

for regulatory risk than the 75% reduction applied to photovoltaic investments.”*°’ At

the Hearing, Spain referred to a discount of 51% for hydro as opposed to 65% in relation

to photovoltaic investments. *°*

B. THE RESPONDENTS’ ARGUMENTS
(1) Applicable Legal Standard

274. Cube and Demeter recall that Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention permits

annulment when a tribunal has failed to “state the reasons which [the Award] is based.”

It argues that the scope of review is “strict and the threshold for annulment is high.”>°?

275. According to the Respondents, Article 52(1)(e) “concerns only ‘the absence of reasons

999360

and not their quality or correctness and does not include “substituting [the

committee’s] own reasoning for that of the tribunal” or to judge either the “correctness”

936

or “persuasiveness of the tribunal’s reasons.”*°! The Respondents add that this was

confirmed by the committee in the Vivendi J case that said that “it is well accepted by
both in the cases and literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state any
reasons... not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons.”*°? This approach, the

Respondents add, “was rooted in the earliest annulment decisions and stems from the

fact that annulment committees should not be assessing the merits of the Tribunal’s

conclusions.”*°3

Cube and Demeter argue that there is a two-part requirement for the relevant legal
standard, and both elements must be met. The Respondents allege that not only there
needs to be a lack of reasons but also the conclusion that lacks reasons has to be outcome-
determinative.** In its Rejoinder, Cube and Demeter add that a failure to state reasons
within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) happens when “(i) the conclusion that allegedly
lacks reasons is ‘outcome determinative’ and (ii) it is ‘impossible’ to understand how the

tribunal arrived at its conclusion.”*°

The Respondents further argue that committees must be careful not to transgress the
mandates of Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention or to include additional
requirements.*°° Cube and Demeter argue that “when assessing Spain’s claims arising
from this ground for annulment, the question for this Committee is simply whether the
Tribunal included any reasons — either explicitly or implicitly — for its conclusions. If
reasons are given, the Committee’s inquiry on this ground must end. This is because
tribunals must be permitted a ‘degree of discretion’ to determine the level of detail with
which to present their reasons.”*°’ Cube and Demeter note that a tribunal need not
address every argument or every piece of evidence presented by the parties. The
Respondents support this argument with the decision of the committee in the Teinver
case.*°8 On this point, the Respondents note that committees have acknowledged that

when “reasons are not stated but are evidence and a logical consequence of what is

stated,” an award should not be annulled for failure to state reasons.*°? In any event,
Cube and Demeter state that “in cases where the tribunal has failed to deal with a question

submitted to it, the appropriate remedy under the ICSID Convention is not annulment,

but rather, an application for a separate supplementary decision.”>”°

278. Cube and Demeter point out that inconsistencies in an award “cannot lead to annulment
unless they are so contradictory that they cancel each other out, leaving the award with
no reasoning at all.”*7! The Respondents submit that if there is an arguable contradiction,
this is not to be resolved by a committee because they should “to the extent possible and

considering each case, prefer an interpretation which confirms an award’s consistency

as opposed to its alleged inner contradictions.”>””

279. Cube and Demeter point that committees have decided not to annul awards even when
they determine that the minimum standard of reasons required under Article 52(1)(e) of
the ICSID Convention has not been satisfied. The reason, according to Cube and
Demeter, is because “[i]nstead, reading the award ‘as a whole in the context, and not by
means of separate analysis of its different parts,’ a committee may ‘reconstruct’ the

Tribunal’s reasoning and make implicit reasoning contained in the Award explicit to

ensure that a ‘reasonable’ reader can follow the award.” 375

. In their Rejoinder, Cube and Demeter point out that the cases cited by Spain actually
supported Cube and Demeter’s position in the annulment proceeding and “run counter
to Spain’s suggestion that this Committee can dissect the Tribunal’s reasoning and

substitute that reasoning for its own should the Committee find it wanting.”>”*

(2) Failure to State Reasons in Determining the Applicable Law and Conclusions
on State Aid

a. Failure to explain that EU law was deemed not applicable

Cube and Demeter argue that Spain misconstrued the Tribunal’s decision with respect to
applicable law. Cube and Demeter submit that Spain did not argue in the underlying
arbitration that EU laws applied to the merits of the case. Rather, consistent with Cube
and Demeter’s position, Spain argued that “the ECT itself as well as applicable rules and
principles of international law governed the dispute and that Spanish law was only
relevant as a factual matter.”>7> In response to Spain’s reference to the paragraphs in its
Counter-Memorial on the Merits where it supposedly addressed this issue, Cube and
Demeter submit that in these paragraphs, Spain explained the procedure of notification
of State aid but that it did not address the relevance, if any, of such procedure.*”° In any
case, Cube and Demeter state that they have always taken the position that issues of State

aid were irrelevant.>””

The Respondents argue that the Award explains “why the Tribunal considered EU State
aid law to be irrelevant to the question of the Claimants’ expectations” and that the
Tribunal “found that the obligations regarding state aid under EU law are obligations
that fall on Spain” and are not binding on investors.*”*> The Respondents note that the
Tribunal did acknowledge that the European Commission’s Decision on State Aid was

introduced into the record but indeed does not address the decision further. According

ns given by the Tribunal” annulment is not required because the ad hoc Committee can explain “the reasons

86

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 97 of 169

to Cube and Demeter, the decision “was completely irrelevant to the question of ... the

incentives under which [Cube and Demeter] invested.”>”

283. The Respondents argue that even though the Tribunal was not asked specifically to
decide on whether EU law applied to the merits, it did analyze and provide reasons on
the jurisdictional question which necessarily entailed an assessment on whether EU law
formed part of the ECT’s governing provision.**? Cube and Demeter submit that this
analysis led the Tribunal to conclude that “[t]he wording of Article 26 ECT does not
permit of any differentiation as regards the investor authorized to bring a claim to

arbitration against another Contracting Party to the ECT.”?*!

284. Cube and Demeter further describe the Tribunal’s analysis whether EU law was
incorporated in the reference to “applicable rules and principles of international law” in

Article 26(6) ECT. In making this analysis, the Tribunal considered whether the ECJ’s

382

Achmea decision had any impact on its conclusion.*** Furthermore, the Tribunal also

considered the relevance of EU law to the merits of the dispute. ***

285. The Respondents dispute Spain’s premise that the Tribunal seemed to admit that treaties
of the EU would be “rules of international law, within the meaning of Article 26(6)
ECT.” Rather, the Respondents submit that the Tribunal “affirmatively rejected that
notion, explaining that the reference to ‘applicable rules and principles of international
law’ in Article 26(6) does not include principles that are peculiar to a sub-system of
international law, such as EU law, to which some but by no means all ECT Contracting

Parties are subject.””>*4

b. Lack of reasoning why Articles 107 and 108 TFEU were not applied

286. The Respondents also oppose Spain’s contention that the Tribunal “radically ignored”
the relevance of Articles 107 and 108 TFEU and that the Tribunal contradicted itself in
its finding when it later asserted that the Parties did not raise the relevance of State aid
law.*8> Cube and Demeter submit that the Tribunal “rejected the relevance of EU state
aid law as part of the governing law of the dispute, rightly acknowledging that the Parties
never argued that it was” but acknowledged that “EU law, including state aid law, was

relevant as part of the factual background of the dispute.”

s

European Commission’s reasoning in the State aid decision not assessed

287. In relation to EU law and State aid, according to Cube and Demeter, the Tribunal
disagreed with Spain and first noted that the State aid obligations are incumbent on
Members States and that investors were entitled to assume that Spain had taken them
into consideration when drafting its legislation.**” With respect to RD 661/2007, the EC
never opened an independent investigation to assess whether these regulations
constituted State aid. Cube and Demeter conclude that there was simply no evidence
that RD 661/2007 could constitute State aid, much less unlawful State aid at the time
they made their investments and therefore could not have any bearing on their legitimate
expectation.*** Cube and Demeter point out that the Tribunal gave a further reason for
rejecting Spain’s State aid arguments by holding that at the time when Cube and Demeter
invested “it was not at all clear that the tariff regime should be regarded as state aid, let

alone impermissible state aid.”**°

288. In regard to Spain’s argument that the Tribunal failed to assess the 2017 EC Decision on
State Aid, and that this constitutes an unknowable error Cube and Demeter argue that
this is incorrect. According to Cube and Demeter, the “Tribunal was clearly aware of

the 2017 EC Decision on State Aid, which was issued after the hearing on the merits,

because it allowed the Parties to address it in their Post-Hearing briefs, and this fact is
noted in the Decision.”*°? Cube and Demeter further point out that the Tribunal is not
required to “address every single piece of evidence put before them” and that this
argument “could only have merit if the 2017 EC Decision on State Aid would change

the outcome of the case.”3?!

(3) Failure to State Reasons for Conclusions on Liability
a. FET standard in Article 10(1) ECT

289. Cube and Demeter assert that there is no contradiction in the Tribunal’s decision with
respect to the correlation between “legitimate expectations” and the FET standard.
According to the Respondents, the Tribunal “simply acknowledges that the term
‘legitimate expectations’ is not expressly found in the text of the ECT but that it is
familiar enough from a wealth of investment treaty cases interpreting FET that it is

acceptable to refer to it in the present case”>?

and then clarified that “it is only in so far
as the negation of expectations constitutes unfair or inequitable treatment that there can

be a breach of [the FET] provision.”*%

290. The Respondents point out that the Tribunal confirmed that a “specific commitment from
the host State to each individual claimant” is not necessary to establish a legitimate

expectations claim. Cube and Demeter noted the Tribunal’s reasoning that “‘sufficiently
clear and unequivocal’ regimes governing a ‘highly-regulated industry’ with the ‘overt
aim of attracting investments’ by holding out certain prospects to potential investors that
a system ‘will be maintained for a finite length of time’ in order to achieve a ‘deliberate
policy’ can give rise to legitimate expectations, ‘provided that those expectations are
objectively reasonable’ and that ‘investments are in fact made in reliance upon them.””>4
Cube and Demeter also recall that the Tribunal differentiated between different types of

Respondents’ investments due to the fact that nearly four years passed between the first

investment in the PV sector and later decision to invest in the hydro sector.*°° Cube and
Demeter point out that the Tribunal went on to assess the changes that the regime and
the market underwent during this period and concluded that “a ‘legitimate expectations’
claim must be based on ‘more than a hope,’ but instead on ‘justified, rational and
reasonable’ expectations.”*°° The Tribunal then assessed “whether such an
understanding required a specific level of external due diligence, or whether it was
sufficient for investors to have considered a risk, sought advice, and reached a conclusion

that was proper.”*97

According to Cube and Demeter, the Tribunal explained that there were four reasons
why it found their reliance on Spain’s representations to be reasonable.*?* The Tribunal
considered what degree of departure from the representation would constitute a breach
and, thereafter, embarked on a detailed discussion of the distinction between stability
and petrification.*°? Furthermore, the Tribunal considered that the State’s obligation
does “require that where the Respondent represented that certain provisions would be
maintained for a certain time, those provisions either are maintained for that time or are
adjusted in a manner that does not significantly alter the fundamental economic basis of

investments made in reliance on that representation.”*°

Cube and Demeter dispute that the Tribunal’s decision is contradictory in considering
that an expectation must be justified but that the way which the understanding on which
the expectations are formed is secondary.*°! The Tribunal considered and rejected the

argument that the investors’ understanding of the State’s representation had to be

justified by a certain type of evidence, *”” and second, the form in which is proven is of

secondary significance because a tribunal could not have an exhaustive list of evidence

that would provide this conclusion. *°>

The Respondents point out that the Tribunal acknowledged that no legal regime can
remain petrified but also confirmed that there are limits to the State’s right to regulate.
On this issue, Cube and Demeter continue to note, and at the same time also point out
that Spain is aware, that the Tribunal “found that RD 661/2007 contained a commitment

to ‘stability’ (not petrification).”4°*

Cube and Demeter dispute that the Tribunal did not determine how a regulatory change
violates the standard. The Respondents argue that contrary to what Spain alleged, the
Tribunal “assessed each disputed measure to consider whether it violated the FET
provision, and it explained whether each measure either amounted to a mere ‘adjustment’
of the original regime not arising to the level of a Treaty breach, or whether the measure
marked a ‘fundamental’ change to or repudiation of the economic basis on which the

investment was made, in which case it did amount to a violation of the ECT.”*°°

In relation to Spain’s argument that the Tribunal failed to conduct an analysis of the
economic impact of the Disputed Measures, the Respondents submit that the Tribunal
“reasoned that [the changes to the regulatory framework] could not [be viewed as a
breach of the ECT in the aggregate], because they did not affect the fundamental
‘economic basis’ of the original regime and there was no ‘decisive break’ from the
original regime.” The Respondents recall that the Tribunal “found that the measures that
make up the New Regulatory Regime — beginning with RDL 9/2013 in July 2013 —

‘mark[ed] the beginning of a radical and decisive break with the earlier regime.””4°°

In its Reply, Cube and Demeter argue that there is no contradiction in finding that not
every defeat of an investor’s expectations will imply a breach of the FET standard, while

also finding that the FET standard includes an obligation not to defeat the basic

expectations that Spain created specifically to encourage investments to implement its

renewable energy policies. According to the Respondents, the first assertion “provides

no qualification on the type of expectations that might be protected...” but merely

confirms that holding an expectation is not sufficient to give rise to a valid claim. The

second part, Respondents argue, “adds qualifiers to confirm at least some types of

expectations that are protected: namely, those that (i) the State created, (ii) to induce

investment, (iii) to meet its policy objectives.”4°”

297. The Respondents also dispute that the Award is inconsistent in stating, on the one hand

that an expectation is more than a hope, while also finding that how the investor’s

understanding is obtained is of secondary significance. The Respondents note that the

Tribunal rejected the notion that a particular form of evidence was required to establish

how the investors’ expectations were created. Furthermore, the Respondents add, the

Award contains the Tribunal’s assessment of the Cube and Demeter’s legal due diligence

reasoning for its conclusions.*°*

b. Lack of valid reasoning for violation of legitimate expectations

298. Cube and Demeter dispute Spain’s argument that the Tribunal contradicted itself or

failed to explain adequately the considerations with respect to the four elements that led

to the conclusion that Cube and Demeter’s reliance on Spain’s representations that RD

661/2007 would remain stable for their plants was justified (the first element).*°

(i) First element: Supposed immutability in RD 661/2007

299. On the nature of RD 661/2007 (the first element), Cube and Demeter point out that the

Tribunal was not making a pronouncement about the rank of RD 661/2007 within the

Spanish legal hierarchy, nor what relevance its status would have for purposes of

legitimate expectations’ in that specific paragraph.*!° Cube and Demeter add that the

Tribunal “found that RD 661 contained the clear, unequivocal, and specific
representations about the tariff rates that would apply for a defined duration on which
the Tribunal determined Cube and Demeter were entitled to rely.”4!! The Respondents
note that the Tribunal was “fully aware of the ‘rank’” of RD 661/2007 within Spanish
law as explained in another part of the decision, and also addressed the particular effect
of Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007.4!? Cube and Demeter note that the Tribunal “was also
careful to explain that its finding of ‘stabilization’ was not equivalent to a finding of
‘petrification’”*!? and in doing so, the Tribunal defined the scope of stabilization
contained in Article 44(3).*!* On Spain’s argument that the Tribunal failed to consider
that RD 661/2007 was itself a modification of prior regimes within the context of Law
54/1997, the Respondents note that this argument was addressed by the Tribunal who

simply did not agree with Spain on the particular issue.*"°

The Respondents dispute Spain’s argument that the Tribunal failed to consider its
argument on the fundamental principles of Law 54/1997, i.e. economic sustainability
and reasonable rate of return.*!® With respect to economic sustainability, Cube and
Demeter note that the Tribunal decided that “Spain as a sovereign state has the right to
react to changing circumstances in the public interest, but that this right is not
unfettered.”*!” In relation to the reasonable rate of return, the Respondents note that the

Tribunal addressed the issue of this principle as “an overriding element in terms of

418,

limiting the remuneration investors could expect and “addressed a related question

with respect to ‘reasonable return,’ noting that Law 54/1997 treated that term as a floor

or lower limit, whereas Spain’s New Regulatory Regime treats it as a cap.”*!”

(ii) Second element: Press Release

301. Cube and Demeter dispute Spain’s argument regarding the Tribunal’s analysis of the
Press Release responding that the Tribunal was not required to explain the points raised
by Spain (the second element).”° The Respondents note that the Tribunal first analyzed
the evidence on the industry awareness that the regime would be stable and not petrified,
and then analyzed the Press Release, concluding that it was a statement attributable to

the State.*?!

302. The Tribunal also noted, as the Respondents explain, that the Press Release was
published by the Ministry of Industry on the date RD 661/2007 was adopted and also on
the Council of Ministers website.*?? Cube and Demeter point out that the Tribunal
concluded that the Press Release “served as additional evidence as to the meaning and
effect of [RD 661/2007]”*?> and “was a strong corroboration that its ‘plain language’
analysis of RD 661/2007 was correct.”*?4 The Tribunal does not refer to the Press
Release as an independent source of legitimate expectations but as one of the “four
reasons” why the Respondents relied on the stability of the regulatory regime and which
was justified.4?> Cube and Demeter point out that it was not the only piece of evidence
considered by the Tribunal but was “additional evidence that emphasized how clear and

specific the statement and the representation from Spain was.”4?°

(iii) Third element: Due Diligence

303. Cube and Demeter dispute that the Tribunal contradicted its finding on the reasonable
understanding of the incentive regime and that it failed to address the substance of
evidence presented by Spain (the third element).”’ First, Cube and Demeter allege that

its conclusions on what they reasonably could have understood of the Spanish incentive
regime.” “8 According to the Respondents, the Tribunal undertook the appropriate level
of consideration of Spain’s representations*” and noted that “Cube and Demeter could
not justifiably expect no changes to the regime, but rather, they were only entitled to
expect that ‘the Special Regime would not be significantly amended or abolished
retroactively, in respect of plants already registered and operating under the Special
Regime.””*° The Respondents allege on this point that “the Tribunal’s conclusion on
the scope of the understanding that was justified is entirely consistent with the Tribunal’s
findings that some of the Disputed Measures were changes that investors should be
deemed to expect, while others were fundamental changes that no investor could have

expected.”*3!

304. With respect to the Spanish Supreme Court decisions, the Respondents submit that the
Tribunal was not persuaded by Spain’s argument** and that the Tribunal “acknowledged
that these judgments presented a ‘general’ rule that investors do not have ‘any vested
right’ to the continuity of established tariffs.”**? Cube and Demeter allege that “[i]t is
only logical that court decisions addressing a different investment framework cannot be
said to automatically extend to a future (improved) investment framework.” The
Respondents note that the Tribunal decided “that the Spanish Supreme Court decisions
were concerned with legitimate expectations under Spanish law, not under international

law.?434

305. In relation to the evidence from the renewable energy sector and Cube and Demeter’s
internal documents, the Respondents also dispute Spain’s allegation that “these show a
right to amend RD 661/2007 for enrolled plants limited only by the notion of ‘reasonable

rate of return’ or that Claimants should have expected Spain to enact major changes or

even complete abolishment of the incentive regime.”**> The Respondents note that this
issue was fully briefed before the Tribunal and that “(i) the Tribunal was not required to
explain its rejection of every argument of Spain or its consideration of every piece of
evidence, and (ii) the Decision nevertheless demonstrates that the Tribunal took this type

of evidence into account and was not persuaded.”*3°

(iv) Fourth element: Invocation of international law

Finally, Cube and Demeter dispute Spain’s allegation that the Tribunal’s reference to
international law and the ECT cannot be a source of support for the investors’ legitimate
expectations (the fourth element).**’ Cube and Demeter note that “the Tribunal merely
noted that its job was to consider Cube and Demeter’s reliance in a context of
international law, not Spanish law, which was a reasonable mention to make, particularly
in light of Spain’s insistence that principles of Spanish law (e.g. hierarchy of norms and

domestic jurisprudence) would lead to a different conclusion.”**

Content of legitii ex ions and the of the di: 1

The Respondents dispute Spain’s allegation that the Tribunal committed errors in the
assessment of the measures that Cube and Demeter disputed as treaty violations.*? The
Respondents allege that Spain continuously conflated issues of liability with issues of
quantum. Cube and Demeter note that, with respect to liability, the Tribunal “found that
‘the ECT protects investors against [] fundamental changes,’ and it specifically found
that Disputed Measures that did not alter or abolish the ‘economic basis’ of the original
regime were not fundamental changes, i.e., they were not sufficient to arise to the level
of a Treaty breach, whereas Disputed Measures that did alter or abolish the economic
basis of the original regime were fundamental changes that violated the Treaty.”*#° Cube

and Demeter note that the Tribunal “explained what it meant by a ‘fundamental change,’

devoting at least a paragraph to each measure it considered.”**! As to Spain’s argument
that the Tribunal did not explain the “economic basis,” Cube and Demeter point that the
“economic basis” were understood to be whether incentives were based on the notion of
promised tariffs, as in RD 661/2007, or on the notion of “reasonable return” (as a cap),
as in the New Regulatory Regime.” Cube and Demeter’s position is that the Tribunal
was referring to the same issue in the Decision when it referred to ‘economic basis’ or
to ‘radical shift’.4? Cube and Demeter conclude that the Tribunal “clearly explained
when and why the changes that Spain imposed moved from being mere adjustments to
the incentive framework to ‘breaking’ with the fundamental principles of the original

regime.” 44

Cube and Demeter point out that the Tribunal agreed with Spain in that the principle of
reasonable return existed in the original framework but disagreed that this principle “was
used in the same manner in the original regime (i.e., a target, and a floor, to incentivize
investment) as in the New Regulatory Regime (i.e. effectively a cap on

remuneration).”*4°

(4) Failure to State Reasons for the Quantification of Damages

Cube and Demeter argue that Spain’s complaints about the quantum analysis of the
Tribunal reflects “nothing more than its disagreement with the Tribunal’s conclusions”
and do not meet the high threshold of annulment of the award based on failure to state

reasons. “4°

damages for the July 2013 measures but not for the prior measures which were more

harmful in quantitative terms.“”

311. Cube and Demeter note that the Tribunal did not base its liability finding on the degree
of harm of each measure but rather on the “qualitative effect of each measure and the
kinds of reforms that investors in the position of Cube and Demeter should have

reasonably expected at the time of each investment.”*4*

According to Cube and
Demeter, while the Tribunal found that the prior measures were mere adjustments to the
Special Regime that did not fundamentally alter the remunerative principles of the

449

scheme," it did conclude that the July 2013 measures violated the ECT because these

constituted a fundamental change in the regulatory paradigm.*°°

312. Even if Spain were correct, Cube and Demeter allege that this would not merit annulment
of the Award because “‘it in no way undermines the Tribunal’s findings on liability or its
calculation of damages as to the measures for which it found Spain liable.”*! If
anything, if the earlier measures were more harmful than the July 2013 measures, which
was the basis of the Tribunal’s finding that there was a violation of the ECT, that would
logically lead to the conclusion that both set of measures would have violated the ECT,
which would only give Cube and Demeter, not Spain, a basis to complain about the

Award.

b. Hydroelectric installations

313. In relation to the Tribunal’s decision to apply a higher discount rate for regulatory risk
to the hydro investments (made in 2011-2012) than the PV investments (which were
made earlier in 2007-2008), the Respondents dispute Spain’s allegation that the
Tribunal’s decision “represents an implicit assumption ‘without any reasoning or basis,

that hydroelectric investments appeared to be subject to less regulatory risk in the but-

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 109 of 169

for scenario than PV plants.”’**? The Respondents submit that the Tribunal clearly
explained that it applied a higher discount regulatory risk rate to the hydro investment
because they had a longer life expectancy and that Cube and Demeter should have
anticipated a greater risk of regulatory change during the life of the investments at the

time of their later investment in the hydro plants.4*

314. With respect to Spain’s claim of contradiction in the Tribunal’s calculation of the
regulatory risk discount by applying the 40% reduction to equity cash flows rather than
planned revenues, Cube and Demeter submit that the Tribunal clearly set out its
reasoning, which Spain may disagree with.*** Furthermore, Cube and Demeter argue
that the method applied by the Tribunal does not “result in a lower regulatory risk

discount for the hydro investments than the PV investments.”*°>

315. At the Hearing, the Respondents disputed the reductions discussed by Spain, and stated
that even though it failed to understand why Spain changed the nature of the reductions,
the reduction of 65% for PV plants cannot be compared with the reduction of 51% for
hydro plants because the Tribunal added an additional discount to the valuation of the
hydro damages, and it did so because of the nature of Claimants’ investments in these

plants.45°

Cc. THE COMMITTEE’S ANALYSIS
(1) Applicable Legal Standard

316. As considered above, the starting point of the annulment process is the finality of
awards.*57 This principle is especially relevant for the failure to state reasons as a ground

for annulment, because potentially more than with the other grounds for annulment, a

review of an award’s reasoning creates the danger of crossing the line of an appeal.***

Once a committee starts looking into whether the tribunal’s explanation is sufficient to
constitute a statement of reasons, it has already embarked upon the quality control of the
award. *?

317. Both Parties have referred to the MINE standard pursuant to which the Committee should
consider whether the reader of an award is able “to follow how the tribunal proceeded
from Point A to Point B.”4° Indeed, the MINE-standard provides a useful starting point
for determining the Committee’s remit pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID

Convention. At the same time, it is a starting point, not a comprehensive test.

H

318. Spain submits that the MINE standard is a minimum,**! whereas Cube and Demeter

emphasize that the standard does not involve or imply that a committee is entitled to

42

review the quality or correctness of the reasons provide and should limit itself to

determining whether any reasons have been provided.*?

319. The Committee does not agree with the proposition that “[t]he task of the ad hoc
committees under Article 52(1)(e) is to determine whether there is a comprehensive and
consistent reasoning on the part of the tribunal...”*°+ This appears to be an overstatement
of the standard identified by the Sempra committee, which referred to the requirement
of identifying “reasons which are reasonably comprehensible and consistent,
demonstrating, on the whole, a logical, and discernable line of thinking.”**

320. Rather, the Committee agrees with the notion that the ability to follow the reasoning,
does not imply a right or ability to review the adequacy of the reasons. At the same time,

it is not limited to a complete absence of reasoning as Cube and Demeter submit (see

458 See CL-158, C. Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY 1003 (2d Ed. 2009), § 86.

below). A more fulsome analysis of the considerations of MINE helps to identify the
boundaries of the review in annulment. The review focuses on whether the reader can
follow how the tribunal proceeded from one point to the next and eventually its
conclusion. As put by the MINE committee, it “implies that, and only that...” and “[t]he
adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review pursuant to Article
52 (1)(e) because it almost inevitably draws an ad hoc Committee into an examination
of the substance of the tribunal’s decision in this regard of the exclusion of the remedy

466

of appeal by Article 53 of the Convention. Similarly, the committee in Fraport

considered that the “adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of

review.”4°7

The ability to follow the reasoning of an award is sufficient and may even include
situations where the tribunal made an error of fact or law.*** Moreover, while some
committees have entertained a review involving whether a tribunal’s reasons were
“contradictory or frivolous,” such review should be considered with “prudence and
measure” as it will inevitably cross the border to the scrutiny of the quality of the award

and thereby to an appeal award.*?

Consequently, in the words of the committee in Tenaris, “the Committee will proceed to
assess the quality of the Tribunal’s reasoning but will limit its examination to the
question of whether the reasons are so incoherent and/or contradictory that they cannot
be understood and followed. This threshold concerns the totality of the reasons in the

Award.?47

Moreover, the Committee agrees with the Respondents and notes that tribunals must be

allowed a “degree of discretion” as to the way they express their reasons, and with what

325.

level of detail.*”! Insofar as there are alleged inconsistencies in an award, these cannot

lead to annulment unless they are so contradictory that they cancel each other out.*””

The Committee also notes that in reviewing a tribunal’s reasoning, the committee may
clarify the reasons of the decision when they are implicit.*” Finally, the Committee also
agrees with the Respondents when referring to the considerations of the committee in
Teinver, “that a tribunal has no duty to follow the parties in the detail of their arguments,
and that the sole fact of failing to address one or more of the same does not in itself entail
annulment, unless the argument in question was so important that it would clearly have
been determinative of the outcome. Likewise, a tribunal has no duty to address in its
award all the evidence that is in the record, and failure to do so does not entail annulment
unless the evidence that such tribunal failed to address was manifestly so important as to
change the outcome of the arbitration. Apart from that situation, it is not the role of a
Committee to step into the shoes of an arbitrator and engage into speculation as to the
relevance that a piece of evidence that a tribunal did not address would have had on the

award.”474

To conclude, the review of whether an award has failed to state the reasons on which it
is based is a fine balancing act. It is for the moving party, i.e. Spain, to show that there
is an absence of reasoning within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID
Convention. In this particular instance, the admonition to consider an award as a whole
is particularly relevant,*”> because many of the arguments presented in the arbitration
are interdependent and overlapping. As illustrated by the cases referred to above, a
tribunal has considerable discretion on how it chooses to present its findings, and which
elements of the parties’ submissions and evidence it considers decisive. It is not for a
committee such as this to substitute its views for those of the Tribunal. Furthermore, a

tribunal need not address every argument or piece of evidence presented by the parties;

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 113 of 169

in cases where a tribunal has failed to deal with a question submitted to it, the appropriate
remedy under the ICSID Convention is not annulment, but rather an application for a
separate supplementary decision.*”° And finally, the Committee reiterates that this is
particularly relevant where the dispute involves issues of law that are subject to
numerous other proceedings in different legal settings, with decisions being promulgated
that may or may not have direct or indirect relevance for the present proceedings, but
which fall outside the scope of annulment, which is limited to the arguments and

submissions presented to the Tribunal in the underlying arbitration.

(2) Failure to State Reasons in Determining the Applicable Law and Conclusions
on State Aid

a. Failure to explain that EU law was deemed not applicable

326. Spain’s arguments under this header have evolved somewhat in its various submissions.
In its Memorial, Spain takes issue with the Tribunal’s considerations in paragraph 159
of the Decision which refers to the decision that EU treaties are not directly applicable
to these proceedings. In this specific paragraph, the Tribunal also decides that while the
tules established by EU secondary legislation are EU law, they are not principles of
international law within the meaning of Article 26(6) ECT. In that context, it submits
that the Tribunal failed to explain the reasons why Articles 107 and 108 TFEU were not
applied, and why the EC’s reasoning regarding the State aid decision has not been

assessed (see below).

327. At the Hearing, however, Spain put a slightly different slant on this argument, first by
emphasizing that “the Cube Award does not specifically address the applicable law in a
separate section. On the contrary, the Tribunal analyses this matter when dealing with

the intra-EU jurisdictional objection with regard to both jurisdiction and the merits.”*77

46 Rejoinder, § 133.
47 Tr, Day 1 (Ms. Fatas Pérez), 36:1-6.

103

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 114 of 169

328. It is not entirely clear what Spain’s interest is in arguing that a separate section should
have been dedicated to the issue of the applicable law as such. Furthermore, the

Committee is not persuaded that Spain requested the Tribunal to do so.

329. Spain’s arguments relating to the alleged failure to provide reasons in determining the
applicable law effectively relate to the issue of State aid law. At the Hearing, Spain made
additional references to the Tribunal’s analysis in relation to jurisdiction and in doing so
provided a very high level overview of the arguments discussed under the first annulment
ground, the alleged manifest excess of power,*’* but these references do not constitute
an independent basis for the allegation that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons, and in

any event were not submitted in this form until at the Hearing.

330. Furthermore, the Tribunal did address the applicable law, both in relation to jurisdiction,
and to a lesser extent in relation to the merits. The fact that the Tribunal addressed the
applicable law in the way it did, primarily in the context of jurisdiction, is understandable
and commensurate with the arguments made by the Parties and the focus of their

submissions.

331. By reference to the slides used by Spain at the hearing in the underlying arbitration, and
by reference to the submissions in the underlying arbitration, Cube and Demeter
demonstrated that Spain referred to the State aid notification procedure as part of the
factual context, to “make the [Tribunal] aware of the existence of said procedure.”*”? It

is not the case that the Tribunal disregarded EU State aid law. Rather, and

understandably given the way Spain presented the issue, it considered EU State aid law
in the context of the factual background and when assessing whether Claimants’
expectations were legitimate. The Committee agrees with the Cube’s and Demeter’s
point that the Tribunal found that the obligations regarding State aid under EU law are

obligations that fall on Spain; they are not obligations that bind investors.**°

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 115 of 169

b. Lack of reasoning why Articles 107 and 108 TFEU were not applied

332. In the annulment proceedings, and in particular at the Hearing, Spain argued that the
Tribunal failed to provide reasons because it was inconsistent in its reasoning in relation
to Articles 107 and 108 TFEU against the background of the requirement of Article 26(6)
ECT to apply principles of EU law. Even if one were to assume that in the underlying
arbitration Spain had argued that EU State aid law, or at least Articles 107 and 108 TFEU
should be deemed applicable pursuant to Article 26(6) ECT, which is not how Spain
presented its case, the Committee does not see a basis for concluding that the Tribunal
failed to provide reasons. Namely, the Tribunal considered first, that while the treaties
are international agreements, they do not thereby become principles of international law.
It then considered that there was no basis for concluding that the EU treaties are directly
applicable to these proceedings. It then went on to consider that while the rules
established by EU secondary legislation, such as rules against State aid, are EU law, they
plainly cannot be principles of international law within the meaning of Article 26(6)

ECT.**!

333. Insofar as Spain seeks to argue that the Tribunal incorrectly considered that all rules
against State aid are contained in secondary legislation, the Committee considers that
this reflects an incorrect reading of the Decision. The Tribunal explicitly considers that
while EU treaties, which obviously includes the TFEU, are international agreements, that
does not make them principles of international law pursuant to Article 26(6) ECT and

482

they are therefore not applicable.*** This applies a fortiori to secondary provisions of

EU law, such as (non-treaty) rules against State aid.

334. Insofar as Spain submits that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons where it considered
the relevance of EU law to the merits of this case and considered that the applicable law
is international law and particularly the ECT and not EU law, the Committee fails to see
that this would amount to a failure to provide reasons, let alone that this has a bearing on

the considerations in relation to State aid. In paragraphs 156-158 of the Decision, the

48 RL-0093, Decision, ff 158-159.
482 RL-0093, Decision, ff 158-159.

105

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 116 of 169

Tribunal set out its reasoning extensively and specifically in relation to the relevance of
the law to the merits of this case.*** It considered and rejected the notion that Article
26(6) ECT includes “principles that are peculiar to a sub-system of international law,
such as EU law, to which some but by no means all ECT Contracting Parties are

subject.”484

The Tribunal then continued to address why it disagreed with Spain’s
position that investors such as Cube and Demeter should have known that any State aid
scheme has to comply with EU State aid rules, namely that State aid obligations are
incumbent on Member States and that “investors were entitled to assume that they had
been taken into account by [Spain] when drafting its legislation.”“*° It also noted that at
the time when Cube and Demeter invested “it was not at all clear that the tariff regimes

should be regarded as State aid, let alone impermissible State aid.”4°°

335. Thus, the Tribunal considered Spain’s position and gave a reasoned rejection thereof,
commensurate with Spain’s position in the underlying arbitration that State aid law, and
in particular the procedure envisaged by Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, might be relevant

as part of the factual background.

s

European Commission’s reasoning in the State aid decision not assessed

336. Finally, as to the decision of the 2017 EC Decision on State Aid, Cube and Demeter
acknowledge that while the Tribunal allowed the Parties to comment on the decision, it
is true that the Tribunal did not address this decision further.*®” However, as Cube and
Demeter submit, in the reasoning of the Tribunal in relation to the assessment whether
Cube and Demeter’s expectations were legitimate, it did not consider EU State aid law
relevant. It therefore did not need to address explicitly whether and, if so, to what extent

it considered the EC’s decision relevant.

337. It is not for this Committee to reassess the Tribunal’s analysis or to seek to rewrite or

enhance the Tribunal’s reasoning, or, as Spain rightly submits “reconstruct what the

every argument made. A failure to provide reasons, in any event, requires that the failure
to address the specific argument or evidence would have changed the outcome of the
award.*8° Spain has not demonstrated that the Tribunal would have decided different
with respect to Cube and Demeter’s expectations in light of the 2017 EC Decision on
State Aid, and this is supported by the fact that this particular instrument was adopted
long after Cube and Demeter made their investment and it relates to a different incentives

regime.

Insofar as Spain invokes the BayWa award in support of their argument that investors
cannot have a legitimate expectation of treatment because it is unlawful under the law of
the host state, the Committee considers that this does not assist Spain. Regardless of the
relevance and impact of this (majority) decision, as the Tribunal decided there is no
evidence in the present case that RD 661/2007 was State aid, let alone evidence that RD
661/2007 constituted unlawful treatment.‘ In any event, the Committee reiterates that
the standard pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is the failure to state
reasons, which, given the Tribunal’s assessment of the irrelevance of EU State aid law

in determining Cube and Demeter’s legitimate expectations, has not been met.

(3) Failure to State Reasons for the Conclusions on Liability

FET standard in Article 10(1) ECT
Essentially, Spain argues that the Tribunal’s reasoning in relation to the FET standard in
Article 10(1) of the ECT is unsupported and inconsistent. Spain’s argument consists of
two parts, a more general discussion of the Tribunal’s decision, and a subsequent
discussion of specific elements of the decision allegedly containing contradictions and

gaps.

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 118 of 169

340. The thrust of the general argument is that there is inconsistency in the Tribunal’s
considerations in relation to Article 10(1) ECT and whether there is a correlation between
the FET standard in the ECT and the notion of legitimate expectations. Specifically,
Spain argues that there is tension between the considerations in relation to the regulatory

power of the state which distinguish between stability and petrification.

341. It is difficult to see what the actual inconsistency or contradiction is that Spain takes
issue with. The Tribunal builds up its decision in a comprehensible way by first
explaining that Article 10 ECT does not protect legitimate expectation as such, but that
it is nevertheless a concept that can be usefully deployed to analyze the claim of an
alleged breach of an FET provision. It then further considers that this does not imply
that every breach of an investor’s (subjective) expectations necessarily implies a breach
of the FET standard, but that nevertheless, the applicable standard does not require that
a specific commitment be made to each individual claimant in order for a legitimate

expectation to arise.49!

342. The essence of Spain’s objection appears to be its dissatisfaction with the outcome,
namely applying a standard that provides protection to investors based on the (general)
establishment of a regulatory regime aiming to attract investors rather than requiring
individual commitments. Thus, Spain objects to the assessment and the Tribunal’s
findings, with which it disagrees. It is not for the Committee to second-guess the
evaluation of evidence, its remit is to review whether the Award fails to set out reasons

for the decision contained therein.

343. Specifically, Spain takes issue with the Tribunal’s considerations regarding the duty to

provide stability while not necessarily imposing petrification, in that investors have no

required.*°* However, the Committee, as Cube and Demeter explain, considers that there
is no contradiction and/or an absence of reasons of the level required by Article 52(1)(e)

of the ICSID Convention.“

344. The Committee reiterates that it is the task of an annulment committee, when reviewing
whether there is a failure to provide reasons, to review the Tribunal’s decision as a whole.
The requirement to provide reasoning does not require or even justify a review of every
single step in the decision-making process, nor a review whether every argument has
been addressed, or a reassessment of the evidence and factual circumstances. In the
present case, the Tribunal carefully reviewed Cube and Demeter’s expectations and the
legitimacy thereof. It came to a nuanced conclusion, distinguishing the more
straightforward situation at the time of the photovoltaic investments in 2008, and the

more ambiguous situation at the time of the hydro investments in 2011-2012.

345. The Tribunal considered that there is not a single prescribed form or acceptable manner
in which investors confirm their understanding of a State’s representation.*° While on
the one hand, the FET provision “does not require the maintenance by the Respondent
of every aspect or every detail of the regulatory regime which existed when the
Claimants made their investments,” the FET obligation does require that “where the
Respondent represented that certain provisions would be maintained for a certain time,
those provisions either are maintained for that time or are adjusted in a manner that does
not significantly alter the fundamental economic basis of investments made in reliance
on that representation.”*°” On this basis, the Tribunal assessed the Disputed Measures,
and concluded that the New Regulatory Regime beginning with RDL 9/2013 “marked
the beginning of a radical and decisive break with the earlier regime”, with the changes

constituting a “shift to a policy based not upon tariffs and premiums fixed for long

periods but upon the concept of the ‘reasonable rate of return’ and a ‘reasonable return’

over the lifetime of a plant.”*°

346. The Tribunal then considered that based on four reasons, Cube and Demeter’s reliance
on Spain’s representation was justified — a finding with which Prof. Tomuschat in his
Separate and Partial Dissenting Opinion disagreed. These separate reasons will be
addressed below. At the outset, however, the Committee notes that the fact that there
was a dissent regarding the evaluation of these reasons, if anything, demonstrates that a
different assessment of the law and facts by one of the members of the Tribunal cannot

be equated with a failure to provide reasons by the entire Tribunal.

b. Lack of valid reasoning for violation of legitimate expectations

347. The Tribunal by majority considered that Cube and Demeter’s reliance on the
representations by Spain in relation to the stability of the regulatory regime was justified
for four reasons. Spain alleges that the considerations of the Tribunal contain
contradictions and failures and gaps in reasoning.**? As stated above, the Tribunal’s
decision needs to be reviewed as a whole, rather than by carving off distinct building
blocks that are referred to in its reasoning. For the sake of completeness, the Committee

will review the arguments made in relation to these four elements.

(i) First element: Supposed immutability in RD 661/2007

348. The first component of this argument relates to RD 661/2007, the text of which the
Tribunal stated to be clear and specific. In particular, the Tribunal considered that “[t]he
representations could be read by all, in a text with the force of law, accompanied by an
explanatory preamble.”*°° Spain argues that this “is manifestly wrong, since it equates

the RD to a rule ‘with the force of law.””*°!

352.

This argument appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the Decision or at least an
attempt to reargue the nature of the relevant legislation. The Decision does not contain
wording on the hierarchy of the Royal Decree, and while that may, in Spain’s view, be
a failing in the Tribunal’s reasoning, it does not make the statement that the Royal Decree
has force of law incorrect, let alone “manifestly wrong”, or even constitute annullable

flaw of the Award.

In addition, Spain argued that the failure to address its argument that as a Royal Decree,
RD 661/2007 could always be amended constitutes an example of inadequate reasoning
by the Tribunal. Furthermore, Spain argued that the decision is contradictory by
considering on the one hand that Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 is clear and specific while
at the same time recognizing that it does not explicitly exclude the possibility of its repeal

by a later law.

First, inadequate reasons is not as such a sufficient ground for annulment. Second, the
argument about the hierarchy of legal norms is closely connected with the argument
relating to the content and nature of the relevant Royal Decree and other laws. What
Spain appears to do is to unpick the Tribunal’s decision and to take issue with and
reargue certain aspects and issues, which have been addressed holistically by the
Tribunal resulting in a skewed analysis of the decision, compounded by Spain’s attempt
to support its argument by pointing out that other tribunals have decided certain issues

differently.

The Tribunal addressed Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007, and its nature as a stability
guarantee while not imposing petrification, and considering that Article 44.3 stabilized
only certain parts of the RD 661/2007 framework. The Tribunal also addressed Spain’s
argument that RD 661/2007 was a modification of prior regimes and that it must be
viewed in the context of the law it implemented, namely the Electricity Sector Act. It

also addressed the arguments on the fundamental principles of the electricity law, namely

52 Mem., 217.

355.

economic sustainability in reasonable rate of return and their impact on the meaning of

RD 661/2007.

Specifically, the Tribunal found that Spain as a sovereign state had the duty to act in the
public interest and had the right to react to changing circumstances and implement a
change in government policies if they become unsustainable.* The Tribunal effectively
set the parameters of this right of an investor to make certain changes while being obliged
not to alter the fundamental economic basis of investments made.** The Tribunal thus
provided a high level framework on which it based its assessment of the facts and
circumstances raised and discussed by the Parties, including in particular whether the
reference to the guarantee of a reasonable return also implied a cap of the remuneration

that any individual electricity producer was entitled to expect.*”>

(ii) Second element: Press Release

The second specific element relied on by Spain is the Press Release issued after the
approval of RD 661/2007. Spain argues that again, the Tribunal confused the status of
this RD 661/2007, because in its discussion of the Press Release the Tribunal refers to
RD 661/2007 as “‘a law” by stating that “these words [of the Press Release] reflect the
statute itself.”°°° Spain also added that the Tribunal failed to clarify whether it deemed
this Press Release an independent source of the legitimate expectations or not.*°’ Spain
argues that the Press Release is not a Government Press Release, and moreover does not

explicitly “speak of the petrification of the system.”*°

Cube and Demeter submit that the Tribunal was not required to explain these aspects,

and that the reasoning on the importance of the Government Press Release is clear and

convincing. The conclusion that it was “a statement attributable to the State,” only

served as additional evidence as to the meaning and effect of that applicable regime.*””

Spain seems to contradict itself: on the one hand it seems to question whether in the
Tribunal’s view the Press Release constitutes an independent source of legitimate

expectation and on the other hand seems to posit that it does.*!°

In fact, the Tribunal refers to the Press Release in its discussion of meaning and scope of
RD 661/2007 and stresses that the wording used in the Press Release matches the
wording in the Decree. It refers to the Press Release as support for its finding.*!! Insofar
as Spain takes issue with the qualification of the Press Release as emanating from the
Government, this is a decision explicitly and amply reasoned by the Tribunal in its

Decision where, for the reasons stated, it determines that the Press Release “is

undoubtedly a statement attributable to the State.”°!

It is difficult to see how the Tribunal’s careful considerations could be seen to be
contradictory, let alone to such an extent that or otherwise so defective as to justify the
conclusion that these passages reflect a failure to provide reasons. Rather, by seeking to
segregate this building block in the reasoning of the Tribunal, Spain ignores the overall
structure of the Tribunal’s reasoning, illustrating the pitfalls of considering the reasoning

piecemeal rather than holistically.

(iii) Third element: Due Diligence

The third element of the Tribunal’s reasoning that Spain takes issue with relates to the
Tribunal’s consideration that “the Respondent has not shown that any more exhaustive
legal analysis would have produced any different understanding of the Spanish

measures.”°!? Spain alleges that this consideration entails a serious lack of valid grounds

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 124 of 169

in addition to forming a serious breach of essential procedural rules.*'* Spain argues
that the Tribunal contradicted itself by finding, on the one hand, that Cube and Demeter
confirmed their understanding of the regulatory regime with external legal counsel and,
on the other hand, that Cube and Demeter’s claim to have understood the regime did not
permit any retroactive changes was not justified; that the Tribunal failed to engage with
the substance of a number of Spanish Supreme Court Decisions and does not explain
whether they are applicable or not to the changes forming the Disputed Measures in the
arbitration; and that the Tribunal failed to explain why it was not persuaded by Spain’s
evidence that the renewable energy industry purportedly knew to expect changes to the
regime or Cube and Demeter’s own documents that Spain argued showed awareness of

the possibility of changes.

360. Spain’s description of the Decision fails to reflect the Tribunal’s considerations fully
and/or correctly. Notably, the language used in the header B 3.2(c) of its Memorial (“the
absence of due diligence by the claimant’s and any evidence to support the
reasonableness of their alleged understanding as at the date of the investments”) shows
that Spain essentially seeks a re-evaluation of the facts and circumstances as assessed by
the Tribunal. Spain clearly disagrees with the outcome of the Decision and argues that
the Tribunal’s consideration and reasoning is unfair,>!> and that it amounts to a reversal

of the burden of proof.

361. In fact, the Tribunal’s analysis is much more comprehensive and nuanced than Spain
acknowledges. In relation to the understanding of the incentive regime, the Tribunal
considered the opposite of what Spain alleges, namely that Cube and Demeter did take
professional advice, albeit that there was no evidence in the record of a detailed written
analysis of the regulatory risk to the PV plants.*!® And contrary to what Spain argues,
the Tribunal did not consider that Cube and Demeter could have legitimately understood

the regime not to permit any retroactive changes; rather, its holding was more limited —

363.

namely that the due diligence conducted “[did] not cast doubt upon the stability or the
duration of the Special Regime established by RD 661/2007.”°!”

In relation to the Spanish Supreme Court decisions, Spain again seeks to take issue with
the evaluation and decision of the Tribunal as it argues that the Tribunal failed to give
“valid” reasons, *'* and that it should have considered and quoted Spanish Supreme Court
cases law more extensively. The evaluation of case law, however, is the prerogative of
the tribunal, and it is clear that the Tribunal engaged with Spanish Supreme court
decisions and their potential relevance and impact.*!? Validity of reasoning is in any
event not the appropriate standard for annulment, and there is no obligation to paraphrase
case law and all relevant documentation comprehensively. Furthermore, as the Tribunal
considered, the decisions do not address RD 661/2007 but its predecessors. Moreover,
as Cube and Demeter point out, after having reviewed the Spanish decisions, the Tribunal
considered that in any event these decision focus on the availability of causes of action
and remedies under Spanish law, and not on the question of the position under the

ECT.

Also in relation to the last prong of its argument relating to the reasonableness of the
investors’ understanding, by reference to the views expressed by business associations
and others, and by reference to internal documentation of Cube and Demeter, Spain
essentially seeks a revision of the Tribunal’s decision. The Tribunal considered the
evidence and evaluated all of these instruments (which Spain acknowledges: “the
Decision does not deny the existence of such evidence, but surprisingly it barely
mentions it and tries to downplay its impact”). **! Consequently, this element of Spain’s
request cannot in itself or in conjunction with the other aspects of its submission justify

the conclusion that the Tribunal has failed to set out reasons.

(iv)Fourth element: Invocation of international law

364. The fourth element referred to by the Tribunal is the consideration that “the significance

365.

s

366.

of Respondent’s representations as to the stability of RD 661/2007 is ultimately not a
matter of Spanish law but of international law, operating in the context of Article 10(1)
ECT.”*” Spain appears to argue that this is a vicious cycle and that the reference to
Article 10 ECT does not constitute an autonomous source of expectations. In fact, the
section from the Decision which Spain quotes in support of its submission that the
Tribunal failed to give reasons (paragraph 386-393, headed “Legitimate Expectations
and Fair and Equitable Treatment”) precedes the paragraph in which the Tribunal sets
out the four reasons for accepting that Cube and Demeter’s reliance on representations
were justified, and in these paragraphs effectively “sets the scene” for the subsequent
more detailed considerations. One element thereof is that the review of legitimate
expectations is to be conducted on the basis of international law, rather than on the basis

of Spanish law.

This section therefore clearly contains the reasons of the Tribunal, which Spain may or
may not agree with. As Cube and Demeter submit, Spain’s argument appears to reflect
a misunderstanding of the structure of the decision. The Committee does not consider
that the reference to international law and its relevance for determining the significance
of the Spain’s representations as to the stability of the regulatory framework constitutes
a failure in the Tribunal’s reasoning, let alone a failure of a level sufficient to satisfy the

standard of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.

Content of legitii ex ions and the of the di: 1

Building on the arguments discussed above, Spain submits in conclusion that the
Tribunal’s assessment of the conclusions on liability “evidence lack of valid grounds.”°?3
As the Committee considered above, Spain has not shown that the Tribunal’s reasoning

fails to provide reasons for the Tribunal’s considerations in relation to the standard of

522 RL-0093, Decision, §] 401.
23 Mem., 4/451.

116

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 127 of 169

legitimate expectations. Essentially, therefore, the arguments in relation to the content

of the legitimate expectation and the assessment of the Disputed Measures are moot.

367. In relation to the regime and the Disputed Measures that made up the regime, while the
Tribunal accepted that Spain had been entitled to make some changes to the existing
regime(s), it held that the move to a regime based on capped “reasonable returns” in RD
661/2007 amounted to a fundamental change. There is no inconsistency between this
conclusion and the rejection of Cube and Demeter’s position in the underlying arbitration

that they could have expected the regime of RD 661/2007 to remain unaltered.

368. The Tribunal extensively discussed the scope of Spain’s representation, in particular in
relation to the cap allegedly imposed by RD 661/2007. It considered and addressed the
meaning and scope of the concept of “a reasonable return” and while it rejected the
notion of a guarantee, it considered that “conversely there is no indication that increases
resulting from the annual updating of tariffs, premiums and supplements in accordance
with Article 44.1 RD 661/2007 could be withheld or reduced if it was considered that a
particular plant was earning more than a reasonable return.”°*+ The Committee is not
persuaded that the Tribunal was inconsistent and/or otherwise failed to provide reasons
by referring intermittently to “economic basis,” “harm’”” “injury” and “radical shift.”
Effectively, it introduced a materiality test in that it might not be reasonable for an
investor to take a promise at face value, even though it could not legitimately expect the

tariff structure of RD 661/2007 to remain in force in unabridged and unamended form.

369. In its submissions in the annulment proceedings, Spain has identified individual phrases
in the Decision and its considerations, juxtaposed these and seeks to argue that these
components of the Decision are inconsistent. What the Tribunal in fact has done is to
undertake a comprehensive overview of pros and cons, weighing factors and ultimately
coming up with an assessment (by majority). By picking out single sentences and
phrases, the logic and structure of the decision is overlooked. The fact that a dissenting
opinion was issued illustrates that there is not necessarily a single way to weigh factors

and assess circumstances. It is not probative, in and of itself, of a failure to provide

524 RL-0093, Decision, §] 287.

117

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 128 of 169

reasons. Equally, the fact that other tribunals in more or less similar situations have ruled

differently, is not decisive.

(4) Failure to State Reasons for the Quantification of Damages
a. Photovoltaic facilities

370. In relation to the impact of the Disputed Measures on the photovoltaic facilities, the
Tribunal distinguished between disputed regulatory measures prior to July 2013 and
post-July 2013. In relation to the former, the Tribunal held that Spain did not breach the
ECT or — in the case of the 7% tax and the water tax — the issues were deemed outside
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. On these bases, the Award found that no compensation
should be awarded for the damage caused by the pre-July 2013 measures. However, the
Tribunal found that the post-July 2013 disputed measures did breach the ECT, and
therefore that compensation was required for said measures.**° Spain argues that the
Decision contains an inconsistency insofar as the Tribunal considered that while the
measures from July 2013 are in breach of the ECT they have a smaller economic impact
than the measures from before July 2013, which are consistent with the ECT according

to Tribunal.

371. Cube and Demeter rebut this argument by pointing out that the Tribunal’s findings were
not based on the degree of harm but rather the nature of the measures. While the
quantitative impact of the earlier measures may have been larger, the nature and
fundamental change in the regulatory measures as of July 2013 meant that only the

impact of these measures justified compensation.

372. Spain expanded this argument at the Hearing, including by introducing slightly different
numbers and/or calculations, intended to support the argument that the impact of post-
July 2013 measures was smaller, namely 26% of the damages claimed compared with
the impact of pre-July 2013 measures. Cube and Demeter took issue with these revised

presentations and calculations. The Committee is of the view that indeed the Hearing on

375.

Annulment is not the time or place to present new calculations, even if they are intended

to illustrate and expand arguments made in general terms earlier.

The considerations in relation to the hydroelectric installations are more elaborate and
multifaceted (see below) than the photovoltaic installations but they are illustrative in
relation to the distinction made by the Tribunal between identifying the fundamental
nature of changes and quantification. The Tribunal refers to the fundamental
characteristics of the Special Regime, **° and states that the majority of the Tribunal is of
the view that the FET standard in the ECT protects investors against the fundamental
changes constituted by the changes of 2013-2014. It then caveats the conclusion,
however, by referring to the need subsequently to assess the impact of the changes. It
states explicitly that “[i]t is possible that there might be a radical change in regime which

in fact produces no harmful effects on investors.”*77

Spain’s argument that the Tribunal’s decision in this regard is inconsistent is prefaced
on the assumption that the radical or fundamental nature of the changes in the regulatory
regime should be equated with and measured by reference to the quantitative impact of
these measures. Notably, in its Memorial,*** Spain argues that the Tribunal seems to
have taken into account the radical nature of the change and then continues to state that
this contradicts the calculations made by the Tribunal which indicate that the measures
prior to July 2013 accounted for no less than 75% of the alleged damage to the PV

installations.°”°

Spain itself quotes paragraph 425 of the Decision where the Tribunal refers to the

conclusion. In the next paragraphs the Tribunal expands its reasoning, all in qualitative

terms, to come to the conclusion that the regulatory changes of 2013-2014 constituted a

fundamental change. In relation to the photovoltaic investments it concludes that “[t]he

question of quantum is considered below” **!

illustrating that the quantitative impact is
simply not part of the equation. Rather, as the citation above demonstrates, the Tribunal
expressly considered that a fundamental change does not produce harmful effects on
investors. Consequently, Spain has failed to show that in relation to the photovoltaic

installations, the Tribunal failed to set out reasons for the calculation of damages.

Hydroelectric installations

With respect to the hydro plants, Spain’s argument is similar, but additionally addresses
the alleged contradiction in the Tribunal’s reasoning by applying a discount not applied
by either Party’s experts. Namely, Spain argues that the Tribunal’s method of calculating
the regulatory risk discount — i.e., by applying a 40% reduction to equity cash flows
rather than to plant revenues — results in an unexplained contradiction and is likewise

incorrect.

First, the Tribunal clearly stated its reason for this decision in the Award, explaining that
“the discount should be applied to equity cash flows, not to revenue or project cash flows.

The 40% discount is the Tribunal’s assessment of regulatory risk applied to recoverable

99532

damages, not revenue. This was the basis of its instructions to and exchanges with

533

the experts,°’* and cannot be said not to be a reasoned decision.

In its Reply and at the Hearing, Spain further amplified its argument by stating that the
failure to apply the approach agreed by the experts led to the application of a 51%
reduction, lower than the 75% (or 65% -- there appears to be some confusion about the
relevant number, and Spain has at different times invoked either) reduction applied to

PV investments. **

379. As Cube and Demeter explained at the Hearing, and regardless of the precise origin of

the numbers presented at the Hearing by Spain, which had not been included in its written

submissions in the Annulment, the Committee agrees that the 40% discount applied by

the Tribunal was based on its discretion.**> Furthermore, the Committee is of the view

that the actual calculations and resulting reductions also took account of the fact that

hydro installations operate for much longer than PV installations, effectively resulting in

a higher risk for investor when investing in such plans. That makes it inappropriate to

apply a one-on-one comparison of the reductions applied to each type of investment.

380. To conclude, Spain has failed to demonstrate the existence of the inconsistencies

identified in its submissions. In addition, it is difficult to see that the alleged

inconsistencies even if they did exist would be of the level to justify annulment pursuant

to the standard imposed by Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.

381. Based on the Committee’s findings as set forth above, this ground of the Application

therefore must also fail.

VII. SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE

A. THE APPLICANT’S ARGUMENTS

(1) Applicable Legal Standard

382. Spain argues that, pursuant to Article 52(1)(d), the Award must be annulled if there is a

departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. It explains that “a rule of procedure is

fundamental if it refers to the essential fairness that must govern all proceedings and is

included within the minimum standards of ‘due process’ required by international

law.”3° Spain further explains that it is considered a “serious” departure when (a) “a

party is deprived of the protection afforded by the relevant procedural rule”**’ and (b)

the fact that the violated procedural standard may be simple does not mean that the

consequences cannot constitute a “serious” violation for the purposes of Article 52(1)(d)
of the ICSID Convention.*** According to Spain, an applicant does not need to show
that the result of the Award would have been different in absence of the procedural
infringement.**? Spain adds that “the introduction of a plea by a Tribunal other than
those put forward by the parties may indeed involve a ground for annulment”*“” and “the

discretion that may be provided by a procedural rule infringed does not alter the fact that

its breach may lead to invalidity.”**!

383. One rule of procedure that is uniformly recognized as fundamental is that a party must
be given a full and fair opportunity to present its case, i.e. the “right to be heard.”>”
Spain submits that the right to be heard also covers a “comparatively equal opportunity

99543

to present its case, which may be the situation when a party cannot present “all

relevant arguments and evidence” *“* with “both parties [having] the opportunity to make
submissions when the tribunal receives new evidence and considers it relevant to its final

deliberations.”*#5 Spain points out that other committees have annulled awards on the

39546

basis that a party was not given “a real opportunity to rebut the evidence’ including

the production of documents phase.*4’ Spain submits that the Tribunal committed a

serious departure from fundamental rules and in particular deviated from Spain’s

fundamental right to be heard. *4*

384. On this basis, the Applicant alleges that the Tribunal seriously departed from a
fundamental rule of procedure with respect to (a) the principle of burden of proof in
various instances, (b) Spain’s lack of opportunity to comment on Cube and Demeter’s
proposed compensation methodology, (c) the refusal to allow the European Commission
to intervene as a non-disputing third party, (d) the refusal to introduce in the record the
Declaration of Members States of January 2019, and (e) the lack of impartiality and equal

treatment of the Parties.

(2) Evidence, Burden of Proof and Right to be Heard

385.

on

First, Spain submits that the Tribunal failed to observe the rules on burden of proof. It
argues that the basic principle of the burden of proof is onus probandi actori incumbit,
and that the Tribunal failed to comply with this principle regarding both the

“incorporation and [the] assessment” of evidence. *?

38

an

Spain argues that the Tribunal seriously departed from the principle of burden of proof
and right to be heard, both in relation to the practices at the hearing and in relation to the
treatment of evidence. Specifically, Spain submits that the Tribunal’s Decision and
Award contained “scarce reference to evidentiary activity developed in the oral

hearing.”**° Spain argues that this absence did not merely reflect a lack of analysis but

that the Decision was written as if the evidence did not exist.**!

387. Spain also alleges that Cube and Demeter had the burden to prove that they had
legitimate expectations and an important element thereof was Cube and Demeter’s due
diligence procedures to understand the framework in which the investment was being
made.**? Spain argues that the Tribunal “unjustifiably substitute[ed] the generally
accepted principle of onus probandi incumbit actori”*>> when it considered that Spain
had not shown that a more thorough analysis would have produced a different
understanding of the Spanish measures.*** This part of the Decision “clashes with a
whole series of elements in the procedure that evidence precisely the opposite, without

the Tribunal offering valid reasons to resolve such contradictions.”*°>

388. Spain describes examples of the contradictions in the Decision such as that the Tribunal
admitted that changes in the system could be expected; that it underestimated the
relevance of Spanish court jurisprudence and the opinions of the sector associations on
the changeability of the legal framework; and that Cube and Demeter’s own internal
documents showed that there was no real expectation of a commitment to immutability

of the system. *°°

389. Spain also points out that it had argued in the underlying arbitration that there was no
commitment to immutability or other binding commitments. The Tribunal in its
Decision found that Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 did not specifically and explicitly
exclude the possibility of revocation by means of a subsequent law and that a diligent
investor could expect changes.°°’ Instead of dismissing the claim, however, the Tribunal
decided to uphold Cube and Demeter’s claims in the underlying arbitration “on the basis

that the regime would nevertheless be expected not to be substantially or radically [be]

altered.”*°* According to Spain, this is a clear violation of the principle of congruence

that should be applicable to a tribunal’s decision.*”

390. In response to Cube and Demeter’s argument that the Tribunal has discretion to refer to

the evidence submitted, Spain submits a that the “right to defence would definitely be

undermined by the fact that, even formally, one party’s evidence was admitted, but the

Tribunal would make no effort to assess, even superficially, the evidence of one of the

parties” which, it alleges, the Tribunal did in this case.*°

391.

Spain further argues that by failing to take into account evidence, in particular the

testimony of Mr. Carlos Montoya, or the two experts, Prof. Pérez Tremps and Vaquer

Caballeria, the Tribunal committed a serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure

guaranteeing the right to be heard.

392.

N

In its Reply, Spain adds that the Tribunal, by rejecting Cube and Demeter’s thesis about

the immutability of the system, but nevertheless finding for Cube and Demeter, the

Tribunal failed to safeguard Spain’s rights (the “evident lack of consistency that breaks

our right to defence: Spain could only foresee that it would have to defend itself from

what was held in the Lawsuit, and it has done so successfully, and surprisingly finds

itself with a new configuration of the case that the Decision introduces ex novo and from

which it has not had the opportunity to defend itself effectively.”)**!

In addition, Spain submits that the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a

fundamental rule of procedure when it calculated the damages on the basis of a Brattle

Memorandum submitted with the Post-Hearing Briefs and to which Spain alleges it had

“no opportunity to comment.” *°?

methodology to assess the effect of RDL 2/2013, and specifically the “adjusted CPI.”
According to Spain, the Post-Hearing submissions were submitted simultaneously which
did not allow Spain an opportunity to respond to Brattle’s new calculations. The next
step in which the experts of Spain could intervene, the Applicant adds, was when
preparing an Expert Joint Model after the Tribunal’s Decision was issued, which was
done on the basis of the report by Brattle.**? Thus, Spain submits the right to be heard

was infringed. **

Spain disputes Cube and Demeter’s allegation that the effect of RDL 2/2013 was minor.
Spain submits that “[t]he damages, excluding the pre-2013 measures, would have been
lower if Brattle had used the same methodology he assumed in his model in both his first
and second reports.”°°

(4) European Commission’s Request to Intervene

Spain asserts that the Tribunal committed another serious departure from a fundamental

tule of procedure when it rejected the EC’s request to intervene as a non-disputing

566

party. The EC submitted its application to intervene as amicus curiae in the

proceedings on 31 October 2018. One day later, on 1 November 2018, the Tribunal
rejected the request for intervention because “allowing the Commission to intervene at
this stage would significantly disrupt the proceedings.”*”

Spain argues that the Tribunal’s one-day decision deprived the Parties of input on intra-
EU disputes. Furthermore, rejecting the EC’s request “without in any way asking the
+9568

parties to express their opinion regarding the relevance of such intervention in itself

constitutes evidence of a departure from fundamental rules of procedure*®. Moreover,
Spain adds, the Tribunal’s rejection was brief and failed to provide justification for the

rejection.*”

398. In its Reply, Spain submitted that ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) of the ICSID Rules
provides that the decision regarding a non-disputing party’s intervention must be taken

571

in consultation with the Parties,°’' and even if the Tribunal’s power to admit the

intervention is discretionary it “does not mean that such a decision can be taken

arbitrarily, without hearing the parties and without sufficient reasoning.”>”

Spain
submits that in its rejection, the Tribunal failed to analyze the EC’s intervention

correctly, thus committing a serious breach of procedural rules.*7*

(5) Declaration of the Member States of January 2019

399. Spain contends that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure
by not allowing Spain to introduce into the record the Declaration of Member States of
January 2019 (“Declaration”).°’* Fourteen days after the Tribunal re-opened the
procedure, Spain requested the Tribunal leave to submit the Declaration on 25 January
2019, which the Tribunal rejected three days later on 28 January 2019. Once again,
Spain argues, the Tribunal’s decision was taken without offering the Parties an

opportunity to present their views.*”>

States was relevant to understand the primacy of EU law, “the Tribunal flatly denied

In its Reply, Spain disputed Cube and Demeter’s allegation that the Declaration was not
relevant. It also submits that it is not required to prove that the outcome of the dispute
would have been different, but only that potentially some aspect of the dispute would

have changed.°””

(6) Lack of Impartiality and Unequal Treatment of the Parties
40:

N

Spain alleges that the lack of impartiality may be a ground for annulment.*”* Spain
submits that the language used by the Tribunal in relation to Cube and Demeter and
Spain reflects a “differentiation without just cause [implying] a breach of a basic

procedural standard, such as the principle of equality of arms.”>”

403.

a

Spain further argues that the language used by the Tribunal in the Decision “revealed
reproaches to the Kingdom of Spain which, moreover, [were] unnecessary.”**° This,
according to Spain, showed an “unjustified animus on the part of the Tribunal ... which
breaks the basic right of the parties to have an impartial Tribunal.”**! These procedural
violations, Spain concludes, are also a demonstration of significant unequal treatment

between the Parties.

404.

Finally, the Applicant alleges that the procedural violations also constitute unequal
treatment between the Parties. **? One such instances is the Tribunal’s decision regarding
due diligence supporting Cube and Demeter’s claims reversing the burden of proof

against Spain. Specifically, the Tribunal decided that “Spain did not demonstrate that a

more thorough study would have resulted in a different understanding.” *** This, Spain
submits, in addition to failing to provide adequate grounds and a breach of procedural
tules, shows “clearly favorable treatment” of Cube and Demeter and “excessively

burdensome treatment” of Spain; in short, discrimination. ***

THE RESPONDENTS’ ARGUMENTS
(1) Applicable Legal Standard

Cube and Demeter allege that Spain has mischaracterized the applicable legal standard
to annul the Award on the basis of a serious departure of a fundamental rule of procedure

and that Spain’s arguments have no merit.

Cube and Demeter agree with Spain that the serious departure of a fundamental rule of
procedure, as consistently interpreted by committees, has to satisfy both criteria of
“fundamental” and “serious.”**> For Cube and Demeter, these criteria, however, have a

highly restrictive character resulting in a particularly high threshold.**°

The Respondents argue that the ordinary meaning of these two adjectives is devoid of
ambiguity and to support this argument they point to the drafting history of the ICSID
Convention. Cube and Demeter recall that “[t]he phrase ‘fundamental rules of
procedure’ was explained by the drafters of the ICSID Convention as a reference to
procedural principles, particularly the right to be heard.”**” They further explain that
“(t]he drafting history further indicates that this ground is concerned with the integrity

and fairness of the arbitral process.”***

408. Cube and Demeter note that “for a departure of a fundamental rule to be serious, the
departure ‘must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from
what it would have awarded had such rule been observed”” as it has been interpreted this

way by the majority of committees. **?

409. The Respondents state that Spain is replacing its burden of proof in the annulment with
a mere conjecture by indicating that it is sufficient to show that the departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure could have potentially affected the outcome. Cube and
Demeter argue that committees have rejected this view and point to the OJ European
Group committee stating that “[a]nnulling an award based on [a] lesser showing would
amount to excessive formalism, speculation and second-guessing of decisions taken in
the original arbitration in a manner that is improper for an annulment proceeding, thus
frustrating the purpose of the arbitration.”°°° The committee in that case restated the
appropriate test by indicating that “the departure must be shown effectively to have
caused the Tribunal to reach a substantially different result from what it would have

reached, if the relevant rule had been observed.”**!

the attention and consideration the Tribunal gave to that evidence. °°

There is no question that the Tribunal followed the proper rules of procedure with respect
to the Parties’ witnesses and experts. According to Cube and Demeter, the Tribunal
“accepted and considered multiple written statements from the Parties’ witnesses” in its
Decision and Award. Cube and Demeter argue that “a decision not to specifically cite
certain witness or expert testimony is not evidence that the Tribunal failed to consider
that testimony, nor that the Tribunal considered one party’s witnesses and experts more

thoroughly than the other’s.”*°+

The Respondents argue that the legal authorities on which Spain relies to explain the
standard for establishing a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure
actually involved instances in which a tribunal “(i) refuses to allow evidence and then
(ii) makes a decision on a disputed issue on the basis that it had no evidence for the
party’s position.”°°> Cube and Demeter argue that this type of breach never occurred in
this case as the Tribunal accepted both written and oral statements from its witnesses and
experts and Spain does not point to a Tribunal’s conclusion on the basis that it did not

have evidence that Spain was not permitted to present.*°°

Cube and Demeter note that “[a]s annulment committees have found, tribunals are not
required to address every argument or all evidence the Parties put before it.”*°? Cube
and Demeter submit that there is no procedural rule requiring the Tribunal to cite the
testimony of all witnesses and experts in an award and that, in any case, Spain’s
witnesses and experts were heard making both written and oral submissions and the

b. Burden of proof

414. On Spain’s argument that the Tribunal reversed the burden of proof in establishing Cube

and Demeter’s understanding of the legal regime that applied to their investments,*” the

Respondents argue that the Tribunal “simply did its job of assessing the evidence before

it

conclusion.”°

and “weighed the evidence of both Parties and reached its own independent

Cube and Demeter state that the Tribunal did recognize that the

Respondents submitted evidence of their own internal and external due diligence, e.g.

the April 2008 IC memo.!

415. The Respondents also note that “the Tribunal found that the totality of the evidence

(including Spain’s evidence) supported a narrower conclusion, namely, that Cube and

Demeter could only expect Spain not to make changes that significantly altered or

abolished the regime retroactively.” °°?

They argue that “far from departing from a

fundamental rule of procedure, the Tribunal simply did its job of assessing evidence

before it.” According to the Respondents, the Tribunal weighed the evidence of both

Parties and reach its own independent conclusion. °°?

s

Right to be heard

416. Cube and Demeter dispute Spain’s allegation that the Tribunal infringed Spain’s right to

a defense or its right to be heard on issues of liability.°°* The Respondents summarize

that, in simple terms, “the dispute concerned Cube and Demeter’s primary claim that

they reasonably expected Spain not to make any changes to the incentive framework,

while Spain contended that it was always permitted to make any changes as long as it

respected the notion of affording plants a (dynamic) reasonable return.”

417. According to the Respondents, after reviewing the evidence, the Tribunal agreed with
Spain that it was entitled to make changes but only to the extent that it did not alter the
economic basis on which Cube and Demeter made its investments.°° This, Cube and

Demeter point out, was in line with what they pleaded as an alternative claim.

418. Cube and Demeter note that the Tribunal’s finding partially accepted its “primary
position (namely, that Spain guaranteed a level of stability), accepted [its] alternative
position (that Cube and Demeter were ‘at least’ entitled to expect that Spain would make

no fundamental change), and partially accepted Spain’s position (namely, that Spain

retained discretion to make some changes to its regulatory framework)...”.°°7

(3) Right to be Heard and Quantum

419. The Respondents recall that the “Tribunal generally addressed the scope of the post-
hearing briefs at the hearing on the merits, and it was understood that there would be one

round of simultaneous submissions from the Parties that would be limited in scope and

aimed at responding to specific questions that the Tribunal would send to the Parties.”°*

At that time, the Respondents add, Spain agreed with this approach and did not request

an opportunity to have multiple rounds of this submission.

420. The Respondents argue that due to the nature of the questions of the Tribunal, Spain
could expect that there would be new damages calculations from Brattle. On 29 October
2017, the Tribunal instructed the Parties to respond in their post-hearing briefs about “the

monetary value of each change to the legal regime... according to each Party’s

experts,”

421. Spain, however, did not object to the instructions nor did it request an opportunity to
respond to the new calculations. According to Cube and Demeter, Spain’s own post-

hearing brief shows that it understood Brattle would submit new calculations and

reserved its right to respond to such calculations. °!°

422. Cube and Demeter point out that the post-hearing briefs were submitted on 21 January
2018 and the proceeding was closed on 18 November 2018.°'! During this time, the
Respondents add, “Spain made numerous requests to make submissions to the Tribunal,
including a submission on the Achmea decision, a submission on the Novenergia award,
and a submission on the Masdar award.”°'? The Respondents add that Spain had other

opportunities to raise it and did not do so, such as when Spain requested the Tribunal to

613

reopen the proceedings to hear further evidence on the issue of Achmea®'’ or when the

Tribunal reopened the proceedings in January 2019 to seek clarification on a limited

614

point related to quantum®"™* or after the Tribunal’s issuance of its partial decision on

quantum. ols

423. The Respondents argue that “[u]nder these circumstances, Spain plainly has waived any
objection it ever had to the Tribunal’s receipt of the Brattle [post-hearing brief]

calculations” pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.°'° Unlike in the Fraport case,

617

which Spain invokes as sole authority for its argument on this topic,°'’ it was obvious

that there would be a new calculation of damages on the basis of the Tribunal’s

instructions and Spain simply never attempted to comment on those calculations.

According to Cube and Demeter, Spain has waived this objection.°!®

424. Finally, Cube and Demeter state that Spain did not allege in its Memorial any specific
issue with Brattle’s calculations that would make a material difference in the Tribunal’s
conclusions.°!? The revised “adjusted CPI’ assumption raised by Spain is misconstrued.
According to Cube and Demeter, “it is simply false that Brattle increased the projected
tariffs in its [post-hearing brief] calculations. If it had done so, the total damages claim
would have been larger in the [post-hearing brief] calculations, and it was plainly not.”*°
In any case, Cube and Demeter further argue that “the issue is also immaterial because
the adjusted CPI assumption about which it now complains it had no opportunity to
respond is consistent with its own case, and thus Spain would have no basis for

disagreeing with that assumption if it was proceeding in good faith.”°!

425. On this matter, Cube and Demeter conclude that the Committee should reject this
argument because Spain had ample opportunity to comment on Brattle’s new
methodology and, even if Spain had commented on the calculations, this would not lead

to a different outcome on quantum. ©?

426. In their Rejoinder, Cube and Demeter point out that Spain did not attempt to address the
significance of the facts or the legal basis of the waiver position at all. Instead, the
Respondents point out, “Spain baldly asserts that these facts ‘do not detract from the
basis of our request for annulment,’ and then repeats the substance of its new complaint
about the alleged change in Brattle’s calculations that it never raised during the

arbitration.”°3

(4) European Commission’s Request to Intervene

427. The Respondents allege that Spain’s contentions that the Tribunal committed a serious
departure from a fundamental rule of procedure by (i) not allowing the EC to intervene
in the case and (ii) not reopening the proceeding to admit the Member State Declaration,
are without merit.°°+ Cube and Demeter further explain that in its Memorial, Spain did

not point to a “rule of procedure” that these decisions purportedly violate. °°

428. According to Cube and Demeter, Spain failed to acknowledge that ICSID Arbitration
Rule 37(2) gives total discretion to tribunals to decide on whether to accept submissions
from non-disputing parties.°° Notably, the Respondents add, under ICSID Arbitration
Rule 37 “while the Tribunal ‘may’ choose to decide whether or not to admit a non-

disputing party, it is ‘required’ to protect against disruptions to the proceeding.” °?”

429. With regard to the requirement to protect against any disruptions to the proceeding, there
is no evidence that admitting the EC’s perspective would result in a different outcome. °*
The Respondents argue that it is not evidence of a breach to a fundamental rule that the
Tribunal reached its conclusion in one day as Spain alleges since the request to intervene
had been sent on 24 October 2018. In any case, the Respondents state, “the issue could

be decided in one day, if the Tribunal were so inclined.”°°

430. Cube and Demeter also point out that at that time Spain never objected to the Tribunal’s
decision on the EC’s intervention. According to Cube and Demeter, this “matter of the
[European Commission] intervention was apparently of no consequence to Spain then,

so Spain cannot rely on it now as basis on which to seek to annul the Award.” °°

431. Ultimately, the Respondents say, “if the Tribunal had allowed the [European
Commission’s] submission, there is no indication that this would have changed the
Tribunal’s findings on matters of the intra-EU objection or the applicability of EU law,
because the Tribunal’s findings on those issues are unanimous and are consistent with
every other tribunal hearing them, even those that received submissions from the

[European Commission].”°!

(5) Declaration of the Member States of January 2019

43.

N

With respect to the Member State Declaration, Cube and Demeter argue that there was
no breach of a fundamental rule and note, first, that Spain’s request was submitted after

the Tribunal had closed the proceeding. *?

Second, even though the Tribunal reopened
the proceeding thereafter on a limited basis, the Tribunal explained why it declined to
receive the Declaration or comments on it stressing that it had already completed its

deliberations.

433.

o

Cube and Demeter argue that the Declaration was not relevant since it addressed the
impact of Achmea and it was one of three declarations issued concurrently by the
Member States. While the Member States that signed the Declaration proclaimed
Achmea rendered the ECT inapplicable to intra-EU disputes, the other two concluded
that Achmea had no impact. In any event, Cube and Demeter argue that “the Member
States are not empowered to interpret EU law, and thus, their declarations as to the

impact of Achmea on the ECT have no legal weight.”°?

434. Furthermore, Cube and Demeter point that the EU Member State declarations are not
legal authorities but political declarations. The Respondents add that other tribunals
have considered these declarations and characterized them as political statements with

no weight and they would have not changed the outcome of any of the cases.°**

More importantly, Cube and Demeter conclude that “the Tribunal afforded both Parties
ample and equal opportunity to present their case and produce evidence on the intra-EU

objection and Achmea.” °°

(6) Lack of Impartiality and Unequal Treatment of the Parties

436. On Spain’s argument that the Tribunal lacked impartiality and did not treat the Parties
equally, the Respondents explain that the examples shown by Spain point to the
Tribunal’s assessment of the Parties’ positions and using its own judgment to reach

conclusions. °°

x

Cube and Demeter note that the specific passages of the Tribunal’s decisions used as
examples by Spain were not passing judgment on the Parties themselves or their

637

intentions. Cube and Demeter state that “Spain reformulating [the Tribunal’s]

arguments does not transform them into evidence of discrimination or unequal

treatment.” 68

438. The Respondents argue that Spain has failed to show and cannot show that the Award
meets the high standard described by the Enron committee, which considered that “lack
of impartiality might be evidenced, for instance, by the fact that an Award consistently
and perversely makes findings favourable to one party without any basis in the

evidence.”°?

439. In conclusion, Cube and Demeter argue that “the fact remains that Spain has not
established [ ] a failure on the Tribunal’s part to treat the Parties fairly and, thus, has not

shown a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.” *°

THE COMMITTEE’S ANALYSIS
(1) Applicable Legal Standard

The starting point is the text of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention which provides
that annulment is permitted on the basis “that there has been a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure.” As the ICSID’s Updated Background Paper on
Annulment sets out, this ground is concerned with the integrity and fairness of the arbitral

process. “4!

Article 52(1)(d) refers to both “serious” and “fundamental” as components of the
standard. Based on these words, committees have generally adopted what ICSID’s
Updated Background Paper on Annulment refers to as “a dual analysis” by considering
both key concepts of “serious departure” and of “fundamental rules of procedure”; or, in
other words, both components must be met. Not every rule of procedure is fundamental

and not every breach is serious.

Clearly, a number of the examples provided by Spain and the cases cited constitute
illustrations of fundamental rules of procedure, such as the right to be heard.” Spain,
in describing the drafting history of the Convention, also referred to the right to be heard
as a fundamental rule of procedure. Similarly, equality of the parties is a fundamental

rule of procedure.

Nevertheless, as much as these and other principles constitute fundamental rules of
procedure in the abstract, in order to constitute a ground for annulment, a committee
must review the alleged breach of the relevant rule of procedure, in the context of the

specific facts and circumstances of the case.

Spain argues that a deviation is serious if a party is deprived of the protection afforded
by the relevant procedural rule, i.e. suggesting that the requirement of serious departure

has been met by virtue of the deviation from the procedural safeguard. Cube and

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 150 of 169

Demeter, on the other hand, underline the dual nature of the legal standard, which they
suggest imposes a requirement to make a showing that the departure would have caused
the tribunal to reach a substantially different result from what it would have reached, if

the relevant rule had been observed. “4

445. As considered above, not every departure from a rule of procedure justifies annulment.
The reference to “seriousness,” whether as a distinct or as an intrinsic component of the
applicable standard of (a breach of) a “fundamental” rule of procedure, necessitates
therefore an assessment of (i) the relevant rule of procedure; and (ii) the facts and

circumstances that potentially constitute the basis of a breach.

446. The fact that a tribunal would have reached a substantially different result had the
relevant rule been observed may be one way, but need not be the only way in which an
applicant can show that it has been deprived of the right which Article 52(1)(d) of the
ICSID Convention seeks to protect. Furthermore, the assessment of whether a particular
fundamental rule of procedure has been breached may also require an evaluation of other
fundamental rules. For example, a party’s right to an opportunity to present its case must
be balanced against the aforementioned principle of equality of the parties, but also the

requirement of the finality of proceedings.

447. The cases referred to by Spain underline that fundamental rules of procedure are not
absolute and need to be seen in context. For example, in Pey Casado the committee
considered that a party could not be expected to present its case “in one minute.” This
example does not provide a positive standard as to how much time a party should be
granted. Similarly, the commentators referred to by Spain provide examples cautiously,
and stress that for instance the refusal to order the production of documents “may”

constitute a breach of the arbitral procedure guarantee. °

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 151 of 169

448. Of the principles invoked by Spain there can be little doubt that some, at least in abstract,
can qualify as fundamental rules of procedure, such as the right to be heard, the principle
of equality of the parties and the right to an impartial and independent tribunal. While
allocating or applying the burden of proof may result in the breach of a fundamental rule
of procedure (such as the equality of the parties), “[rJules on the burden of proof”®*” are

less obviously a fundamental rule of procedure as such.

44

©

Nevertheless, given the need to consider the alleged breach in the context of the specific
facts and circumstances of the case, and the requirement to assess the seriousness of the
breach, the abstract characterization of principles as fundamental or not is of limited
effect. While a party should obviously be provided with the opportunity to present its
case, and this should be a fair and equal opportunity, this may not always amount to an

unabridged right to present documentation or other evidence.

45

Ss

Hereinafter, the Committee will review the concrete allegations made by Spain on the
basis of a holistic analysis of the importance of the rule of procedure invoked, the
seriousness of the impact of any breach, and generally the facts and circumstances in the

context of which the alleged infringement took place.

(2) Evidence, Burden of Proof and Right to be Heard

451.

Under this heading, Spain addressed a number of alleged breaches, namely the
Tribunal’s treatment and analysis of the evidence and, in particular, witness statements
provided by Spain, as well as the Tribunal’s treatment of the burden of proof and

inconsistencies in its decision-making.

45

N

As to the first allegation, at first blush, Spain effectively argues that the Tribunal failed
to respect the right of each Party to present its case and evidence™® thus not respecting

Spain’s right of defense or its right to be heard.

© Mem., § 487.
48 Mem., | 486.

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 152 of 169

453. However, a closer view of the specific allegations demonstrates that what Spain takes
issue with is the Tribunal’s assessment of the facts and evidence. Illustrative is Spain’s
statement that “it is not true that Spain has not prove[n] that a minimally more exhaustive
analysis would have led to a different understanding of the regulatory framework,”*°

which Spain seeks to support by reference to a number of arguments made in the

underlying arbitration.

454. However, while Spain may disagree with the Tribunal’s assessment, determining
whether Spain proved its case or not, was the Tribunal’s prerogative. There is no right
to a comprehensive reference to each and every argument made and this is not a case of
failing to respect a party’s right to be heard. This is a case of reviewing and assessing
facts and allegations and in this case rejecting Spain’s arguments and deciding against
it. The Tribunal engaged with Spain’s argument but was not persuaded by the arguments
and evidence it invoked, including the witness and expert statements submitted by Spain.
In the Committee’s view, there is no indication that the Tribunal “disliked Spain”®!:the
Decision and the Award are written in a neutral and businesslike manner and do not

reflect an emotive reaction to either Party.

455. The second component of Spain’s arguments relates to the Tribunal’s treatment of the
investors’ due diligence. First, as stated above, “burden of proof” is not a fundamental
rule of procedure in abstract. Courts and tribunals in many legal systems generally adopt
the principle that claimants need to prove their case (and respondents should prove the
positive allegations which they rely on in rebuttal of claimants’ arguments). However,
this general principle is subject to many qualifications and nuances, leading courts and
tribunals to adopt an approach including the use of rebuttable presumptions or other
mechanisms to mitigate this general principle. Moreover, and importantly, evidence and
burden of proof lie at the intersection between procedural and substantive law and

ultimately courts and tribunals will assess the evidence presented by both parties.

459.

In the present case, the Tribunal clearly adopted as a starting point the principle that
Cube and Demeter had to make a showing of their legitimate expectations. As the
Tribunal’s considerations show, whether the expectations created by the establishment
of a regulatory regime were sufficiently demonstrated, involves a positive showing of
due diligence,” the adequacy of which was questioned by Spain.®? Specifically, Spain
takes issue* with the Tribunal’s consideration that “[Spain] has not shown that any
more exhaustive legal analysis would have produced any different understanding of the

Spanish measures.” >

Contrary to what Spain submits, and in addition to the point made before that “burden
of proof” as such is not a “fundamental rule of procedure” in the meaning of Article
52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal was not engaged in a reversal of the
burden of proof; in fact, it is a direct response to an argument that Spain made in the

case. °°

As to the Tribunal’s consideration of the scope and nature of the due diligence, in
addition to the discussion contained in the Dissenting Opinion, the evaluation of the
scope and relevance of the due diligence undertaken by Cube and Demeter, against the
background of the factual and legal matrix of the case, is open to different interpretations.
Reviewing this assessment is not the task of an annulment committee, and certainly does

not meet the threshold of a showing a serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure.

The third sub-element of this alleged ground for annulment is closely connected with the
discussion under the heading “Failure to State Reasons on Conclusions of Liability”, and
indeed, Spain largely refers to its earlier arguments in relation to the alleged failure to

provide reasons. It reiterates that while the Tribunal rejected Cube and Demeter’s

arguments about the immutability of the system’ it found for Cube and Demeter on the

basis of arguments not made by Cube and Demeter. °*

460. As considered above, the Tribunal conducted a comprehensive and integrated analysis
of the facts and circumstances. After reviewing the evidence presented, the Tribunal
agreed with Spain that it was entitled to make changes, but only those that did not alter
the economic basis on which Cube and Demeter made their investments.°° The
Tribunal’s finding amounted to a partial acceptance of both Parties’ positions, namely
that while Spain had guaranteed a level of stability precluding fundamental changes to
the regulatory regime, Spain retained discretion to make some changes to the regulatory
regime and Cube and Demeter could not expect petrification of the entire system. The
Tribunal’s decision cannot be characterized as one whereby a tribunal “effectively
surprises the parties with an issue that neither party has invoked, argued or reasonably
could have anticipated during the proceedings.”® Rather, as considered above, the
Tribunal’s considerations and assessment of the evidence is firmly based on the Parties’

debate in the arbitration.

(3) Right to be Heard and Quantum

Spain’s argument in relation to the Tribunal’s damages calculation is two-pronged. First,
Spain argues that the Tribunal based the calculation on the Brattle memorandum
submitted with Cube and Demeter’s post hearing brief and that it did not have the
opportunity to comment thereon. However, the procedure adopted by the Tribunal at the
conclusion of the merits hearing explicitly provided for the submission of a single round
of simultaneously filed post hearing briefs. Spain did not object to this procedure, even
though the Tribunal explicitly instructed the presentation of new calculations by the

Parties’ experts in these briefs.

submitted with Cube and Demeter’s post hearing brief but it never raised
the issue of the Brattle memorandum in the underlying arbitration. The first time it did

so was during the annulment proceedings.

463. Furthermore, after receipt of the post hearing brief, and the Brattle memorandum
contained therein, Spain made two additional submissions in relation to a number of
legal decisions, but it did not seek the opportunity to comment on the memorandum.
Moreover, after the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed, they were reopened to deal
with issues of quantum in order for the Parties to submit further evidence on issues of
quantum. The Parties also submitted a joint expert report identifying areas of agreement
and disagreement regarding the implementation of the Tribunal’s quantum instructions,
as well as a supplemental joint expert report, and also these occasions Spain failed to
raise the alleged procedural concern caused by the presentation of the Brattle

memorandum in the context of a single round of simultaneous submissions.

464. This overview of the numerous procedural steps ordered by the Tribunal in consultation
with the Parties, and the careful and transparent procedural timetable issued by the
Tribunal demonstrate that the Parties were fully aware of the structure and sequence of
submissions in relation to damages. Especially in light of the fact that Spain reserved its
rights, showing awareness of the possible implications of the time schedule adopted,
combined with the fact that there were exchanges in relation to quantum after the
submission of the Brattle memorandum, including two joint expert reports which
provided a platform for raising areas of agreement and disagreement, it is difficult to see
that the procedure adopted by the Tribunal amounts to a breach of a fundamental rule of

procedure.

465. Tribunals have considerable freedom whether to adopt consecutive or simultaneous
exchanges, and in the present case, there was full transparency about the procedure.
ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 stipulates that a party must promptly object to any failure of

the tribunal to comply with rules applicable to the procedure, failing which it shall be

deemed to have waived its right to object. It is telling that Spain did not object at the
outset, and only reserved its rights for later, and in the end did not avail itself of the
opportunity to invoke any allegedly infringed rights even though it had ample
opportunity to do so in the context of the subsequent quantum submissions. Under these
circumstances, the Committee finds that Spain has not demonstrated a breach of a

fundamental rule of procedure.

The second prong of Spain’s arguments relates to the impact of the alleged inability to
comment on the Brattle memorandum, which goes to the potential seriousness of the
breach. Spain argues that the inability to respond to the Brattle memorandum was
particularly serious because Brattle changed its methodology. Whereas previously,
Brattle had presented calculations on the basis of an adjusted CPI by subtracting 1%
from the CPI, in the memorandum submitted with the post hearing brief, Brattle assumed
that the CPI is equal to the adjusted CPI. Cube and Demeter dispute that the Brattle
memorandum is in fact based on the assumption that the long-term delta between CPI
and adjusted CPI would always be 1%. Moreover, Cube and Demeter stress that Spain
itself had always argued that there was no material difference between CPI and adjusted
CPI in the long run. In light of the Committee’s decision that by adopting the procedure
that it did, the Tribunal did not fail to provide Spain with an opportunity to be heard, the

seriousness of this alleged breach is moot.

(4) European Commission’s Request to Intervene

Spain submits that by deciding on and rejecting the EC’s request to intervene as a non-
disputing party within one day without granting the Parties the opportunity to comment
on the request, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.
Spain stresses the importance of the intervention and the opportunity for the Parties to
comment thereon, and it questions the veracity of the Tribunal’s response that it had

completed its deliberations as it had just decided to reopen the proceedings.

First, the Committee notes that ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) provides that a tribunal
may allow a non-party to file a written submission, but only after consulting both parties.

While the wording of this provision therefore stipulates that a request may not be

N

accepted without consulting both parties, there is no comparable obligation addressing
the scenario whereby a tribunal rejects a request to intervene. Given the potential impact
of the intervention by a non-party it is understandable that additional procedural

safeguards apply should a tribunal admit a third party intervention

Furthermore, a tribunal has discretion whether it allows a non-party submission (“the
Tribunal may allow”, italicizing added), and in applying that discretion at the stage of
the proceedings and the potential impact on the proceedings are relevant considerations,
in addition to the tribunal’s basic assessment as to whether it anticipates that the
submission “would assist” the tribunal. In this context, the Committee notes that EC’s
request came three years into the proceedings and after completion of deliberations, or

at least the bulk thereof.

Finally, the Committee notes that Spain does not appear to have requested to be provided

with the opportunity to comment on the request.

In sum, Spain has failed to show that by rejecting the request of the European
Commission to be allowed to make a non-party submission, and in doing so within a day
without the Parties’ comments, the Tribunal committed a serious breach of a

fundamental rule of procedure.

(5) Declaration of the Member States of January 2019

Spain alleges that by refusing to accept the Declaration of the Representatives of the
Governments of the Member States of 15 January 2019, the Tribunal committed a further
breach of a fundamental rule of procedure. ICSID Arbitration Rule 38 provides that
when proceedings have been closed, the tribunal may exceptionally reopen the
proceeding “on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to
constitute a decisive factor, or that there is a vital need for clarification of certain specific
points.” The Tribunal invoked this limited discretion when it sought additional and
specific input from the Parties in relation to the calculation of damages. That does not
create an entitlement to a subsequent reopening in relation to evidence which a party

wants to bring to the attention of the tribunal.

147

Case 1:20-cv-01708-EGS Document 33-1 Filed 03/29/22 Page 158 of 169

473. The Committee emphasizes the limited scope of annulment, both as a result of the high
threshold imposed by Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention and by the intrinsic
limitations of the annulment system, which preclude a committee from second-guessing
the impact of a subsequent evidentiary or legal development, because the scope of
annulment is confined to the arguments, evidence and case law available to the tribunal

in the underlying arbitration.

474. These limitations are compounded by and particularly pertinent in a situation such as in
the present case where the law is being developed and where decisions by other tribunals
and courts are constantly emerging. This constantly evolving environment places
tribunals on a dilemma about how to balance the right of parties to present their case and
the principle of finality, which underlies ICSID Arbitration Rule 38. There comes a
point in every procedure when enough is enough. In conclusion, the Committee finds
that Spain has failed to make a showing that by refusing to accept the submission of the

2019 Declaration, the Tribunal breached a fundamental rule of procedure.

(6) Lack of Impartiality and Unequal Treatment of the Parties

475.

on

Spain submits that the Tribunal did not treat the Parties equally, and that it failed to show
a comparable standard of respect vis-a-vis Spain as it did vis-a-vis Cube and Demeter.
It argues that the Tribunal’s attitude and terminology reflects bias, which it submits

constitutes a ground for annulment for lack of impartiality.

47

a

First, the Committee notes that while there may be some scope for invoking lack of
impartiality as a basis for annulment pursuant to Article 52(1)(d), this scope is limited.
The high threshold in this respect is confirmed by the decision by the Enron committee
which considered that “lack of impartiality may be a ground of annulment under Article
52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, and leaves open the possibility that such lack of
impartiality might be evidenced, for instance, by the fact that an Award consistently and

perversely makes findings favourable to one party without any basis in the evidence.”

662 RL-0108, Enron, § 278.

480.

At the Hearing, Spain also referred to the Ziser annulment decision as an example of a
situation in which a committee effectively annulled an award on the basis of a lack of
impartiality. The Ziser case involved a review of circumstances pertaining to one of the
arbitrators and his individual independence and impartiality and therefore arguably a
more “classic” scenario of (potential) lack of impartiality. These scant examples show
that annulment on the basis of alleged impartiality is highly unusual and the threshold is

high.

Spain’s argument consists of three parts, the way in which the Tribunal dealt with the
jurisdictional objections, the language used and, effectively as catchall argument, an
allegation of discrimination by reference to arguments previously presented under other
annulment grounds. Insofar as Spain’s arguments, these duplicate the arguments made
in relation to the other, rejected, annulment grounds, and effectively amount to a
repetition of the substantive arguments made previously. It is difficult to see that even
hypothetically there is a separate and independent basis for concluding that the Parties

were treated unequally, let alone that this was due to lack of impartiality.

The most concrete argument made by Spain is the use of wording allegedly
demonstrating an “unjustified animus.” Essentially, however, here too Spain takes issue
with substantive considerations of the Tribunal. There does not appear to be any
objective basis for the suggestion that the Tribunal was anything but professional and
treated the Parties fairly and equitably, and there has been no showing of conduct
meeting the standard identified by Spain itself by reference to the Enron decision,
namely consistently and insistently making findings in favor of one of the Parties without

the corresponding factual support.

For the reasons set out above, the Committee rejects Spain’s request for annulment based

on the Tribunal’s alleged failure to state reasons.

THE APPLICANT’S COST SUBMISSIONS

In its Memorial, Reply and submission on costs, Spain requested that the Committee
order Cube and Demeter pay all the costs of the proceeding, including its legal fees,
expert witness, translation and other costs, as well as ICSID costs. In its submission on
costs, Spain indicated that the total amount of costs was EUR 1,519,098.42, broken down

as follows:

482. On 18 May and 13 December 2021, after the Parties’ submission on costs, the ICSID

483.

Secretariat requested two additional advance payments of USD 50,000 each. On 2 June
2021 and 4 January 2022, the ICSID Secretariat confirmed receipt of the amounts

requested from the Applicant.

In its submission on costs, Spain also requests that Cube and Demeter be ordered to pay
post-award interest on the abovementioned sums, at a compound rate of interest to be
determined by the Committee until the date of full satisfaction of the Committee’s

decision.

. The Applicant states that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention grants the Committee
“the authority to assess and apportion the costs” and also confers a degree of discretion

663

to decide on the allocation of costs. Spain argues that the Committee “should be

guided by the principle that ‘costs follow the event’ if there are no indications that a

664

different approach should be called for. According to the Applicant, other

committees have decided to allocate the costs to the losing party.

According to Spain, it was compelled to go through the annulment proceedings on the
basis that it had argued from the commencement of the underlying arbitration that the
Tribunal lacked jurisdiction. Spain argues that “the Applicant was left with no choice
but to initiate this annulment proceedings and it should be compensated for the costs

incurred.”

Spain submits that “if the ad hoc Committee understands — as the Kingdom of Spain is
confident that it will — that the grounds for annulment raised by the Kingdom of Spain
should be upheld and that the award must be annulled the Cube Parties should be ordered

to pay for the legal, arbitration, and annulment costs of the Kingdom of Spain.”°”

Finally, Spain also alleges that its costs are reasonable in light of the complexity and

duration of the case. °*

ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(1), as affirmed by this Committee in

Procedural Order No. 1.”°"° According to the Respondents, committees do the allocation

on the basis of a number of factors, including the success on claims and arguments. °”!

491. Cube and Demeter argue that “Spain abused its right to annulment by seeking an appeal
or retrial on dozens of issues that go well beyond the limited grounds for annulment
under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.” On this basis, Cube and Demeter request

that Spain be ordered to reimburse the legal fees and expenses.

. According to the Respondents, they were forced to incur in legal fees to defend against
Spain’s arguments and request the Committee to award Cube and Demeter the entirety
of their legal fees and expenses “in order to wipe out as far as possible the

consequences.”°”>

Cube and Demeter argue that they should not be required to contribute to the costs of the
proceeding (i.e., the costs and expenses of ICSID, including fees and expenses of the
Members of the ad hoc Committee). According to Cube and Demeter, “no ad hoc
committee has ever required a successful annulment respondent to reimburse the
applicant any of the proceeding.”° The Respondents sustain that this is in line with

Regulation 14(3) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations.

Finally, the Respondents argue that their legal fees and expenses are reasonable.
According to Cube and Demeter, “factors relevant to determining whether fees and legal
expenses are reasonable typically include the length of the proceeding, the complexity
of the case, the amount in dispute, and the efficiency in which a party presents its
case.”°75 The Respondents allege that their legal fees are reasonable in light of the many
issues raised by Spain to which they had to respond, the complexity of the arguments,
and the steps in the proceeding. Therefore, the Respondents conclude, Spain should be

ordered to bear the Respondents’ legal fees and expenses in its entirety. °”°

THE COMMITTEE’S DECISION ON COSTS

. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how
and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members
of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

This provision, together with ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) (applied by virtue of
ICSID Arbitration Rule 53) gives the Committee discretion to allocate all costs of the
proceeding, including attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems

appropriate.

Both Parties have requested that the other Party be ordered to pay all the costs of the
proceeding, including legal fees, expenses and ICSID costs, as well as post-decision
interest at a compound rate of interest to be determined by the Committee. Both Parties

have argued that their costs are reasonable.

Both Parties have acknowledged that the Committee has wide discretion to assess and
apportion the costs, and Spain has invoked the principle that “costs follow the event.”
The Committee considers that this is indeed the appropriate starting point in relation to
the awarding the cost of these proceedings. While potentially other factors may need to
be taken into account, which may lead to some adjustment, in this case the Committee
does not see any reason to do so, and in particular does not see the need to distinguish
between cost of legal representation and other costs. The Application was of a very
broad nature and included a certain amount of repetition. In addition, the Application
considerably exceeded the scope of what can reasonably and properly be raised in
annulment proceedings, notably by presenting new lines of argument, also supported by

new documentation.

The costs incurred by Cube and Demeter are similar to those incurred by Spain and the
Committee does not find the costs or expenses disproportionate to the issues presented.
Consequently, Spain shall bear the costs of representation incurred by Cube and

Demeter, as well as the costs of the proceeding.

Both Parties have claimed compound interest without specifying what they deem to be
the appropriate rate. The Committee considers that the EURIBOR rate which was
adopted by the Tribunal is the appropriate rate. The amounts awarded shall therefore
bear interest at the six-month EURIBOR rate compounded semi-annually, with the

remaining provisions relating to interest continuing to apply unchanged.
