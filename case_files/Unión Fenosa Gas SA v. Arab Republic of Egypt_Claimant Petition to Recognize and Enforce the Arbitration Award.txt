Factual Background

L Summary of the Dispute

7. UFG’s business concerns the liquefaction, shipping, regasification and
commercialization of natural gas. The Parties’ dispute arises out of Egypt’s failure, through its
own acts and omissions, and through the acts and omissions of its instrumentalities and organs,
to afford UFG’s investments in Egypt (namely, the Damietta natural gas liquefaction plant in
northeast Egypt (the “Damietta Plant”) and a long-term gas sale and purchase agreement) the
protections set forth in the Agreement on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of
Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Arab Republic of Egypt, signed November
3, 1992 and entering into force on April 26, 1994 (the “Treaty”).3 The Tribunal found that
Egypt, on its own and through its instrumentalities and organs, breached its substantive
obligations under the Treaty, namely, its obligations under the fair and equitable treatment
standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty.*

8. The facts underlying UFG’s investment in Egypt, and the Parties’ dispute, are
summarized as follows:

9. On August 1, 2000, representatives from the Egyptian General Petroleum
Corporation (“EGPC”)5 and Unién Fenosa Desarrollo y Accién Exterior, S.A. (“UFACEX”),

entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (““SPA”).© The SPA was endorsed by the Egyptian

3 A true and correct English version of the Treaty is attached hereto as Exhibit C.
4 Bx. A, 13.7.

5 EGPC was created by the Egyptian State to regulate and manage the Egyptian hydrocarbons sector in 1976
(Ex. A., 15.16).

Minister of Petroleum’ and ultimately approved by the Egyptian Council of Ministers and
Egypt’s Prime Minister.’

10. Under the SPA, UFG? acquired the contractual right to receive from EGPC—and
later, from the 100%-state-owned Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (“EGAS”) after it
succeeded to EGPC’s rights and obligations under the SPA—a certain supply of natural gas at
the Damietta Plant over a period of at least 25 years.!° Critically, the economic feasibility of the
Damietta Plant was dependent on its receiving the contractually agreed quantities of natural gas
from EGPC (later EGAS).!!

11. The SPA includes several guarantees including that “seller shall at all times keep
a back up supply to meet an on stream (load) factor of 95% of the LNG Complex”; that “Seller is
the sole responsible [party] for securing adequate supplies of N[atural] G[as] for performance of
its obligations hereunder”; and that “Seller is aware that the supply of N[atural] G[as] to Buyer
under this Agreement is a key element for the successful development of the Project and...
Seller represents and warrants that its availability of NG will be sufficient.” !2

12. The SPA also includes a force majeure clause, which expressly excludes changes
in the market that affect the price or demand for gas or that result in the need to divert natural gas

to other users from the scope of force majeure within the meaning of the SPA.!3

7 Ex. A, 5.51.

8 Bx. A, 5.54.

9 While originally these rights were granted to UFACEX, on June 30, 2003 UFACEX assigned its rights and
responsibilities under the SPA to UFG and EGAS granted this request (Ex. A, 5.59).

13 Bx. A, 5.64.

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 5 of 17

13. Moreover, the SPA includes an obligation for EGPC to “undertake[] to procure
that the Egyptian authorities undertake not to interfere with the rights of [UFG] under this
Agreement, and not to dictate or promulgate any act or regulation which could directly or
indirectly affect the rights of Buyer . . . even in the case of a N[atural] G[as] shortage in Egypt,
save Force Majeure as defined in this Agreement.””!4

14. In reliance upon Egypt’s undertaking (as demonstrated by the Minister of
Petroleum’s endorsement of the SPA) not to interfere with or adversely affect the rights of UFG
even in the case of a domestic natural gas shortage, UFG then spent approximately US$ 1.3
billion to build the Damietta Plant and its associated facilities, completing this project on time
and within budget.!5 The Damietta Plant was located about 60 kilometers west of Port Said and
the Suez Canal. At the time of its construction, it was the largest single-train liquefaction facility
in operation in the world.!6

15. While Egypt was not a party to the SPA, the Tribunal found that “[g]iven the
importance of the gas supply for the LNG Project, to be made by EGPC (later EGAS), this
undertaking [of non-interference] by the Egyptian authorities was no formality.”!7 In fact, this
undertaking was of “great significance” as demonstrated by the Ministry of Petroleum’s
endorsement of the SPA.'8

16. In November 2004, the Damietta Plant began operating, and in May 2005,

President Mubarak inaugurated the Damietta Plant.!9 Over the following years, however, EGAS

failed to comply with its supply obligations, and from October 2006-2012, it provided only lesser
amounts of gas ranging from 84% to 61% of the contractually agreed supply.2° EGAS’s failure
to comply with its obligations continued, despite UFG’s agreeing to pay EGAS an increased
price for gas on November 13, 2006, a further increased price on December 12, 2007, and yet
another increased price on July 11, 2008.2! Seeking to reach a mutually acceptable state of
affairs, UFG also agreed, as of January 21, 2011 to accept not only another price increase but
also delivery of amounts of gas below the contractually required level for a temporary period of
33 months so long as EGAS promised to restore full delivery of contractual amounts thereafter
and would acknowledge that UFG remained entitled to all of the quantities of previously
undelivered gas and that these amounts would be delivered in future years at a specified rate of
increased deliveries.??

17. From 2012, the gas supply to the Damietta Plant was repeatedly restricted and
suspended by EGAS as a result of Egypt’s decision to divert gas to other purchasers, including
the domestic electricity sector.23 From 2012 through 2014, there was not enough gas to comprise
even a single cargo.”4

18. The Tribunal found that the Egyptian State was ultimately responsible for the

decisions to curtail and cut gas supply to the Damietta Plant.25 Moreover, the prioritization of

gas away from UFG and SEGAS was expressed by Egyptian officials including the Minister of
Petroleum” as well as President Morsi.?7

19. In the interest of resolving their differences and to restart supply to the Damietta
Plant, EGAS and UFG executed the Transient Agreement on October 29, 2013, which called for
immediate resumption of gas deliveries at a reduced but steadily increasing level over a specified
transient period until full, contractually required quantities would again be delivered as of the
beginning of 2018.28 Thereafter, on November 12, 2013, SEGAS wrote to EGAS to request a
beginning of feed-gas delivery to the Plant in order to resume LNG production under the
Transient Agreement, pursuant to its terms.2? EGAS refused to comply with this request,3° and
on November 15, 2013 directed the shutdown of the Damietta Plant.3! Given EGAS’ flagrant
breach, UFG submitted a notice of intent to terminate the Transient Agreement, given that its
terms were not met.32 The Damietta Plant did not receive any gas for export under the Transient
Agreement.

20. In sum, since December 2012, no LNG has been lifted from the Damietta Plant,
and it remains idle.33 The Tribunal found that Egypt’s acts and omissions, as well as those of
EGAS, EGPC and their affiliates which were attributable to the Egyptian State, with regard to
the Damietta Plant amounted to breaches of its obligations under the Treaty, effectively

destroyed UFG’s investment in the Damietta Plant, and resulted in substantial damages to

UFG.*4 Seeking to vindicate its rights under international law and to obtain the compensation to
which it is rightfully entitled as a result of Egypt’s destruction of its investments, UFG
commenced the arbitration underlying this proceeding on February 14, 2014.35
IL. The Treaty

21. The relationship and dispute between UFG and Egypt is governed by the
Agreement on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of
Spain and the Arab Republic of Egypt. The Treaty was signed on November 3, 1992, and
entered into force on April 26, 1994.

22. The substantive obligations of each Party to protect the investors of the other
Party, as well as their investments, are set forth, in part, in Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty.3°

23. Article 3 provides, inter alia, that “[e]ach Party shall protect in its territory the
investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations, by investors of the other Party and
shall not hamper, by means of unjustified or discriminatory measures, the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment, expansion, sale and if it is the case, the liquidation of such
investments.”57

24. Article 4 provides, in relevant part, that:

“1. [e]ach Party shall guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment for the
investments made by investors of the other Party.

2. This treatment shall not be less favorable than that which is extended by each
Party to the investments made in its territory by investors of a third country.

5. In addition to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this article, each Party shall
apply, under its own law, no less favourable treatment to the investments of
investors of the other Party than which is that granted to its own investors.).”38
25. Article 1 of the Treaty defines the term “investor” as: “(a) any individual who, in
the case of Spanish investors, is resident in Spain under Spanish law and, in the case of investors
of the other Party, possesses its nationality pursuant to the law of that Party; [or] (b) any legal
entity, including companies, associations of companies, trading corporate entities and other
organizations which is incorporated or, in any event, is properly organized under the law of that
Party and is actually managed from the territory of that Party.”39
26. UFG is a Spanish company incorporated under the laws of Spain and managed
from within Spanish territory. Therefore, the Tribunal found that UFG is an investor for
purposes of the Treaty. Egypt did not dispute this fact.4°
Ill. The Parties’ Agreement to Arbitrate
27. Article 11 of the Treaty, pertaining to Disputes between One Party and Investors
of the Other Party, provides as follows:

1. Disputes between one of the Parties and one investor of the other Party shall
be notified in writing, including a detailed information, by the investor to the
host Party of the investment. As far as possible the Parties shall endeavor to
settle these differences by means of a friendly agreement.

2. If these disputes cannot be settled in this way within six months from the date
of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the conflict shall be

submitted, at the choice of the investor, to:

— a court of arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the
Arbitration of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce;

the court of arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of Commerce;

the ad hoc court of arbitration established under the Arbitration Rules of
Procedure of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law;

the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) set
up by the “Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of other States,” in case both Parties become
signatories of this Convention;

Regional Centre for International Commercial arbitration in Cairo.

3. The arbitration shall be based on:
the provisions of this agreement;
the national law of the Party in whose territory the investment was made,
including the rules relative to conflicts of law;
the rules and the universally accepted principles of international law.
4. The arbitration decisions shall be final and binding for the parties in conflict.
Each Party undertakes to execute the decisions in accordance with its national
law.4!
28. Article 11 of the Treaty memorializes Spain’s and Egypt’s consent to arbitration

of claims by an investor of a Party against the other Party. Per the terms of the Treaty, when a

dispute arises with respect to a Party’s compliance with its obligations thereunder, “the conflict

shall be submitted, at the choice of the investor, to . . . the International Centre for Settlement of

Investment Disputes (ICSID) set up by the ‘Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes

between States and Nationals of other States,’ in case both Parties become signatories of this

Convention.’””4?

29. By filing its Request for Arbitration on February 14, 2014, UFG submitted its
claims to arbitration under the ICSID Convention (which both Spain and Egypt signed and
ratified)*3 pursuant to Article 11 of the Treaty, in the following terms:

Pursuant to both Article 11 of the Agreement on the Reciprocal
Promotion and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of
Spain and the Arab Republic of Egypt (the “BIT”) and Article 36
of the Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention”),
Claimant Union Fenosa Gas, S.A. (“UFG”) hereby requests that
the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) institute an arbitration proceeding
against Respondent, the Arab Republic of Egypt (“Egypt” or “the
Government”).44

30. In accordance with Article 11 of the Treaty, UFG’s submission to arbitration
coupled with Egypt’s consent set forth in Article 11 constituted an agreement to arbitrate within
the meaning of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention.

IV. The Arbitration

31. On February 14, 2014, UFG commenced the arbitration by filing and serving a
Request for Arbitration on Egypt. The Request for Arbitration invoked Article 11 of the Treaty
and Article 36 of the ICSID Convention.45 On February 27, the Secretary-General of ICSID
registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the
Parties of the registration.*6

32. The arbitration was seated in Washington, D.C., and proceeded in accordance

with the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules. The selection of the Tribunal was

completed on December 8, 2014. The Tribunal selected by the Parties consisted of Mr. V. V.

Veeder (President), Dr. J. William Rowley, QC (appointed by UFG), and Mr. Mark Alan
Clodfelter (appointed by Egypt).47

33. Egypt was competently represented in the arbitration by attorneys from the
Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority (ESLA) and attorneys from Cleary Gottlieb Steen &
Hamilton LLP.‘8 Egypt participated in all aspects of the arbitration: it submitted a Request for
Bifurcation and a Reply Memorial on Bifurcation, a Counter-Memorial on the Merits and
Memorial on Jurisdiction, as well as a Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction.49

34. The Tribunal conducted the hearing (in which both parties participated and were
represented by their respective outside counsel) on jurisdiction and liability at the ICSID
facilities at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. from March 6 to March 11, 2017, during which
the Tribunal heard testimony from both UFG’s and Egypt’s witnesses and experts.5? The
Tribunal closed the proceedings on July 11, 2018 through Procedural Order No. 17.5!

Vv. The Award

35. The Tribunal issued the ICSID Award on August 31, 2018.

36. With regard to jurisdiction, the Tribunal ruled that UFG was an “investor” under
Article 1(1) of the Treaty, as a legal entity incorporated in Spain and as a member of the Unidén
Fenosa association of Spanish companies.52 The Tribunal also found that the SPA, its execution,
amendments and performance by UFG, together with UFG’s acquisition of shares in SEGAS,

constituted an “Investment” under Article 1(2)[5] of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID

Convention.*3| The Tribunal also addressed two additional preliminary defenses regarding
corruption and necessity. After extensive briefing on these matters, the Tribunal rejected these
defenses, concluding that no corruption had occurred and rejecting Egypt’s necessity defense.55

37. On the merits of UFG’s claims, the Tribunal “decide[d] that the Claimant
established the liability of the Respondent for breach of its obligations under the [“fair and
equitable treatment”] standard in Article 4(1) [of] the Treaty.”5° The Tribunal found that Egypt
exercised its sovereign authority and public powers by curtailing the gas supply to the Damietta
Plant, including by directing EGAS to limit and eventually stop the supply of feed gas under the
SPA.57 Further, the Tribunal found that the curtailment of gas by the Minister of Petroleum in
aid of satisfying domestic gas demand was not justifiable under the concept of force majeure,
and therefore amounted to discriminatory treatment by Egypt of UFG’s investment.58 The
Tribunal found that the decline in feed gas supply was reasonably foreseeable to Egypt (as a
result of Egypt’s own policies that overstimulated local demand for natural gas while
simultaneously enacting pricing and other policies to restrict further development of Egypt’s
natural gas resources by local gas producers), but not to UFG.5?

38. As compensation for Egypt’s breaches of the Treaty, the Tribunal awarded UFG
US$ 2,013,071,000 (the “Principal Sum”), after tax but before interest. The Tribunal also
awarded UFG two kinds of interest: Pre-award interest on the Principal Sum, from January 1,

quarterly;®! and Post-Award interest on the Principal Sum, from the date of the Award until
payment, at a rate of Three-Month LIBOR + 2.0%, compounded quarterly.®2 Additionally, the
Tribunal awarded UFG its legal costs, and ordered Egypt to reimburse UFG for such costs in the
amount of US$ 10,000,000.%3 Lastly, the Tribunal awarded UFG the costs of the arbitration,
subject to a set-off for any reimbursement of its advances by ICSID.%4

39. The ICSID Award remains unpaid. By this action, UFG seeks recognition and
enforcement of the ICSID Award by this Court.

Cause of Action — Recognition of the ICSID Award Pursuant to 22 U.:

 

1650a

40. UFG repeats and realleges the allegations above as if set forth fully herein.

Al. The United States is a signatory to the ICSID Convention, which establishes a
framework for the resolution of investment disputes between a foreign sovereign party to the
Convention and a national of another State party to the Convention. Awards issued pursuant to
the ICSID Convention are subject to recognition and enforcement in the United States under
Article 54 of the ICSID Convention and pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a.

42. Egypt signed the ICSID Convention on February 11, 1972, and deposited its
ratification on May 3, 1972.6 The ICSID Convention entered into force for Egypt on June 2,
1972. As the Tribunal found, UFG is a national of Spain, which became a State party to the

ICSID Convention on September 17, 1994.56

43. Article 53 of the ICSID Convention provides that an award rendered by an ICSID
tribunal “shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other
remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with
the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to
the relevant provisions of this Convention.” There is no stay of enforcement currently in place.
Thus, pursuant to Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, Egypt is obligated to abide by and comply
with the terms of the ICSID Award without any further action by UFG.

44. Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that “[e]ach Contracting State
shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the
pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of
a court in that State.”

45. The United States has been a party to the ICSID Convention since October 14,
1966,’ when the Convention entered into force and Congress enacted enabling legislation in the
form of 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, which provides as follows:

An award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter IV of
the [ICSID] convention shall create a right arising under a treaty of
the United States. The pecuniary obligations imposed by such an
award shall be enforced and shall be given the same full faith and
credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general
jurisdiction of one of the several States. The Federal Arbitration
Act (9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) shall not apply to enforcement of awards
rendered pursuant to the convention.

46. The ICSID Award was rendered by an arbitral tribunal pursuant to Chapter IV of

the ICSID Convention.

47. The pecuniary obligations under the ICSID Award consist of the Principal Sum in
the amount of US$2,013,071,000 plus Pre-Award and Post-Award interest at a rate of Three-
Month LIBOR + 2.0%, compounded quarterly, and legal costs in the amount of
US$10,000,000.°8 The tribunal also taxed the costs of the arbitration to Egypt; those costs will
be determined by ICSID by October 30, 2018.

48. Egypt has not paid any part of this outstanding pecuniary obligation.
