PETITION TO CONFIRM ARBITRAL AWARD
Petitioner Rusoro Mining Limited (“Petitioner” or “Rusoro”), by and through the
undersigned counsel, hereby petitions this Court for an Order: (i) confirming, recognizing, and
enforcing the final award (the “Award”)! rendered by an arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”) on
August 22, 2016 in an arbitration (the “Arbitration”) between Petitioner and Respondent the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (“Respondent” or “Venezuela”), pursuant to the Arbitration
(Additional Facility) Rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the

“ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules”), and the July 1, 1996 Agreement between the

' A duly-certified copy of the Award is attached as Exhibit 1 to the Declaration of Elliot Friedman (“Friedman
Decl.”) filed concurrently with and in support of this Petition.

Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and
Protection of Investments; (ii) entering judgment in Petitioner’s favor against Respondent in the
amount of the Award plus interest and costs awarded therein, post-judgment interest pursuant to
28 U.S.C. § 1961, and the costs of this proceeding; and (iii) awarding Petitioner such other and
further relief as this Court may find just and proper.

Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1. The Arbitration was seated, and the Award was rendered, in Paris, France. Petitioner
brings this summary proceeding under Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 201
et seq. (the “FAA”) and the United Nations Convention for the Recognition and Enforcement of
Foreign Arbitral Awards, June 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2517, 330 U.N.T.S. 38 (the “New York
Convention”) to confirm a final arbitration award issued in its favor and against Respondent in
its entirety.
2: Petitioner Rusoro is a gold mining company incorporated in Canada, with its head office
in Vancouver, British Columbia. Petitioner’s registered address is 1500-1055 West Georgia
Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6E 4N7, Canada.
3. Respondent the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is a foreign state within the meaning of
the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1332, 1391(f), 1441(d), and 1602-11.
4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§ 1330(a), because a foreign state does not enjoy sovereign immunity from a proceeding brought
to confirm an arbitral award that “is or may be governed by a treaty or other international
agreement in force for the United States calling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral

awards.” 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6)(B). Because the arbitration concerned property expropriated in

Case 1:16-cv-02020-RJL Document1 Filed 10/10/16 Page 3 of 14

Venezuela and an international treaty (inter alia), the Award is subject to the New York
Convention, which is in force in the United States. See 9 U.S.C. § 201.
3: This Court also has subject matter jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to 9 U.S.C.
§ 203, which provides that any “proceeding falling under the [New York] Convention shall be
deemed to arise under the laws and treaties of the United States,” and, consequently, under 28
USS.C. § 1331.
6. This Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over the Respondent pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§ 1330(b).
7. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 204 and 28 U.S.C.
§ 1391(f)(4).
The Arbitration Agreement

A. Respondent’s Consent to Arbitration
8. Respondent consented to arbitrate its disputes with Canadian investors such as Petitioner
through a bilateral investment treaty, the July 1, 1996 Agreement between the Government of
Canada and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of
Investments (the “Treaty”), which entered into force on January 28, 1998.”
9. Respondent’s consent is found at Article XII of the Treaty. Specifically, Article XII(5)
provides:

Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission

of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this

Article.
10. Respondent is defined in the Treaty as a “Contracting Party.” See Treaty at 1 (referring

to “[t]he Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela, hereinafter

* Friedman Decl., Ex. 2.

Case 1:16-cv-02020-RJL Document1 Filed 10/10/16 Page 4 of 14

referred to as the ‘Contracting Parties’). As is further set out below and in the Award at
paragraphs 188 through 344, Petitioner submitted its claim to arbitration in accordance with the
provisions of Article XII of the Treaty and the Tribunal had jurisdiction over the dispute. Article
XII(5) therefore represents Respondent’s written consent to arbitration.

B. Petitioner’s Consent to Arbitration

11. As the Award establishes, Petitioner is a protected investor under the Treaty with the
right to commence arbitration against Respondent. See Award {| 289-340.

12. Article I(g)(ii) of the Treaty defines an “investor” to include “any enterprise incorporated
or duly constituted in accordance with applicable laws of Canada, who makes the investment in
the territory of Venezuela and who does not possess the citizenship of Venezuela.”

13. Article I(a)(i) of the Treaty defines an “enterprise” to include “any entity constituted or
organized under applicable law, . . . including any corporation... .”. Petitioner is a corporation
incorporated under the laws of Canada.

14. Article I(f) of the Treaty defines an “investment” to mean “any kind of asset owned or
controlled by an investor of one Contracting Party either directly or indirectly . . . in the territory
of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter’s laws.” This definition includes
“movable and immovable property and any related property rights,” id. art. I(f)(i), and “rights,
conferred by law or under contract, to undertake any economic and commercial activity,
including any rights to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources,” id. art. I(f)(vi).
15. As the Tribunal found, Petitioner’s investments in Venezuela fall within this definition of
protected investments. See Award {| 340 (rejecting Venezuela’s arguments to the contrary); see

also id. J§| 289-340.

Case 1:16-cv-02020-RJL Document1 Filed 10/10/16 Page 5 of 14

16. The Tribunal further found that Petitioner properly submitted its investment-based claims
against Respondent to arbitration in accordance with Article XII of the Treaty. See id. {{{{ 203-
240.

17. Under Article XII(3) of the Treaty, an investor may submit a dispute to arbitration if it
has: (i) consented in writing thereto; (ii) waived its right to initiate or continue any other
proceedings in certain alternative forums in relation to the alleged breach of the Treaty; and
(iii) initiated the arbitration within three years of the date on which the investor acquired (or
should have acquired) knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge of incurred loss or
damage.*

18. Petitioner satisfied each of these requirements. First, on December 15, 2011, Petitioner
delivered to Venezuela a Notice of Dispute,* in which Petitioner expressed its unconditional
consent pursuant to Article XII(3) of the Treaty to submit the dispute to arbitration. Second, on
July 17, 2012, Petitioner confirmed that no other related proceedings were pending before the
courts or tribunals of Venezuela and waived its right to initiate any such proceedings. See
Rusoro Mining Limited v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Request for Arbitration, July
17, 2012 (“Request for Arbitration”) { 138.5 Third, Petitioner submitted claims within the
specified three-year time period. See Award {{[ 209 (establishing July 17, 2009 as the cut-off
date for arbitrable claims), 211-12 (listing Venezuela’s acts giving rise to Petitioner’s claims).°

* Article XTI(3) also requires an investor to satisfy additional conditions if the matter involves taxation. See Treaty
art. XII(3)(c). As the Arbitration did not concern matters of taxation, this requirement did not apply to Petitioner.

* Friedman Decl., Ex. 3.
* Friedman Decl., Ex. 4.

° Pursuant to Article XII(3) of the Treaty, claims submitted to arbitration must be raised within three years of “the
date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and
knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.” The Tribunal observed that Petitioner’s claims were
based on a number of Venezuela’s measures, some of which occurred before that three-year cutoff date. See Award
211. The Tribunal determined that it would consider each of those measures individually, and ruled that any
alleged breaches based solely on measures that occurred before the three-year cutoff date were time-barred. Id.

Case 1:16-cv-02020-RJL Document1 Filed 10/10/16 Page 6 of 14

Thus, as the Tribunal found, Petitioner submitted arbitrable claims under the Treaty. See id.
qs 203-40.

19. The Tribunal also found that Petitioner properly commenced arbitration under the ICSID
Additional Facility Arbitration Rules.’ See id. QM 255-73. Article XII(4)(b) of the Treaty
provides that an investor may submit a dispute to arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility
Arbitration Rules if “either the disputing Contracting Party [Venezuela] or the Contracting Party
of the investor [Canada], but not both, is a party to the ICSID Convention.”*® At the time the
Arbitration was initiated, Venezuela was a party to the ICSID Convention, but Canada was not.”

Summary of the Underlying Dispute

20. Petitioner is a gold mining company incorporated in Canada. Award {| 77.

21. Petitioner’s claims in the Arbitration arose from Venezuela’s breach of its Treaty
obligations towards the Petitioner and Petitioner’s investments in Venezuela’s mining sector.
See id. | 179. Petitioner was the controlling shareholder in 24 Venezuelan mining companies
that, in turn, held valuable contractual rights to explore, develop, and exploit gold and other
minerals in Venezuela’s Bolivar State. Jd. { 78.

22. These mining rights were granted to Petitioner's subsidiaries through an array of

agreements with the Venezuelan government and Venezuelan state-owned corporations. Jd. [79

 

4 231-32; see id. 49] 228-40. Accordingly, for the purposes of determining liability, the Tribunal only considered
alleged breaches based on Venezuela’s post-July 2009 measures.

7 Friedman Decl., Ex. 5.

® See Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (“ICSID
Convention”), opened for signature March 18, 1965, 17 U.S.T. 1270, 575 U.N.T.S. 159.

° See Friedman Decl., Ex. 6, International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, List of Contracting States
and other Signatories of the Convention 1, 5. Venezuela denounced the ICSID Convention on January 24, 2012,
and in accordance with Article 72 of the Convention, that denunciation took effect on July 25, 2012. See id. at 5.
However, Venezuela’s withdrawal did “not affect the rights or obligations . . . arising out of consent to the
jurisdiction of [ICSID] given . . . before” the effective date of denunciation. ICSID Convention, art. 72. Petitioner
initiated the Arbitration on July 17, 2012, prior to the effective date of denunciation. Award {J 259-261; see also id.
259-68.

Case 1:16-cv-02020-RJL Document1 Filed 10/10/16 Page 7 of 14

(referencing rights derived from mining concessions directly granted by the Venezuelan Ministry
of Energy and Mines, contracts entered into with state-owned corporations, leasing agreements
with state-owned corporations, and joint venture agreements with mining rights holders).

23. The Tribunal found that Petitioner invested more than $750 million between 2006 and
2008 to acquire and develop these mining interests. /d. {[ 678. Petitioner did so at a time when
Venezuela’s regulatory environment was favorable to and encouraging of private gold
production for export to foreign markets. See id. {J 138-39, 144.

24. However, beginning in 2009, the Venezuelan government introduced measures that
“significantly altered the legal regime for the export of gold.” /d. {| 145. These measures placed
stringent new controls on gold exports and restricted the ability of Rusoro’s subsidiaries to deal
in any foreign currency earned from exports. See id. {{{ 144-59. In particular, the Venezuelan
government passed Resolution BCV No. 10-07-01 (the “July 2010 Resolution”), which required
private gold producers to sell at least 50 percent of their gold directly to the Venezuelan Central
Bank, in exchange for payment in Venezuelan currency. Jd. { 157. In addition, certain of the
measures passed by Venezuela afforded preferential treatment to state-owned gold producers.
See, e.g., id. f§[ 150-51.

25... These alterations to the regulatory framework were designed to serve Venezuela’s
admitted political and financial objective “to convert all private mining activities to mixed
[public-private] enterprises, and [to] expropriate[e] holders of substantial mining rights who
resisted the change.” /d. 414. That goal was fully realized in 2011, when Venezuela’s then-
President Hugo Chavez declared the “immediate nationalization” of the Venezuelan gold mining

sector. Jd. {| 160. President Chavez executed the written decree carrying out the nationalization

Case 1:16-cv-02020-RJL Document1 Filed 10/10/16 Page 8 of 14

(the “Nationalization Decree”) with the declaration, “jOro, oro, oro!” (“Gold, gold, gold!”)
beneath his signature. /d. {| 653.

26. The Nationalization Decree required Petitioner to negotiate with the Venezuelan
government for 90 days to establish a purchase price for the seizure of Rusoro’s investments, and
to determine the feasibility of a joint public-private enterprise between Rusoro and the
government. Id. { 164.

Qh. The negotiations were doomed to fail. As a Canadian investor, Rusoro was entitled under
the Treaty to compensation for the fair market value of its investments. /d. {[{[ 404, 751. Yet
Venezuela failed to pay, or even offer, fair market value compensation. Instead, as the Tribunal
observed, it was “undisputed that in accordance with the Nationalization Decree, the maximum
amount of compensation which could be offered by Venezuela was capped at the ‘valor en
libros’ [‘book value’] of the investment.” /d. 400. “In reality, however, Venezuela’s offer did
not even reach the cap provided for in the Nationalization Decree.” Jd. 1 406.'°

28. Given Venezuela’s position and Petitioner’s unwillingness to sacrifice its rights under the
Treaty, in March 2012, all mining rights held by Rusoro through its subsidiaries were formally
extinguished pursuant to the Nationalization Decree. /d. { 171. Thus, as a result of Venezuela’s
actions, Petitioner was forced to cede control of all of its subsidiaries’ assets and operations to

the Venezuelan government without any compensation whatsoever. Jd. {[ 173.

” See also Award J 408 (“In the present case, the Nationalization Decree provided for the payment of compensation
to investors in the gold sector, but established a cap, which was not foreseen either in the [Treaty] or in domestic
Venezuelan law. The Bolivarian Republic then submitted an offer, for an amount which was significantly below the
cap established by the Decree. The reason for this reduction was the alleged illegality of Rusoro’s investment — an
argument which has been analysed and dismissed by the Tribunal. Furthermore, the amount offered was never
actually paid to, nor deposited in escrow in favour of [Petitioner].”).

The Arbitration
29. Petitioner commenced the Arbitration by submitting a Request for Arbitration to ICSID,
which ICSID received on July 17, 2012. Award { 1; see Request for Arbitration. The Request
for Arbitration was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID, pursuant to the ICSID
Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, on August 1, 2012.'' Award { 3.
30. In the Request for Arbitration, Petitioner asserted multiple breaches of the Treaty by
Venezuela and requested an award of compensation plus interest, other relief as the Tribunal
considered appropriate, and the legal fees and costs incurred by Petitioner in the arbitral
proceedings. See Request for Arbitration {[ 151.
31. A three-member arbitral Tribunal was constituted on January 4, 2013. Award { 8.
Professor Juan Fernéndez-Armesto, a Spanish national, was appointed President of the Tribunal
by agreement of both parties. Professor Francisco Orrego-Vicuiia, a Chilean national, was
appointed arbitrator by Petitioner, and Judge Bruno Simma, a German national, was appointed
arbitrator by Venezuela. Jd. {| 5-7.
32. Respondent was represented by counsel throughout the Arbitration, namely the Attorney-
General of Venezuela and attorneys based in Washington, D.C. from the law firm of Foley Hoag
LLP. Id. { 15.
33. The legal seat of the Arbitration was Paris, France. /d. | 18. By agreement of the parties,
the Arbitration hearings physically took place in Washington, D.C. Id.

35. The Tribunal held a partial hearing on jurisdiction and the merits from December 7
through 12, 2014, in Washington, D.C. /d. {[ 62. A second hearing on jurisdiction and the merits
was held in Washington, D.C. from February 1 through 4, 2015. Id. 66.
36. The proceedings were declared officially closed on June 29, 2016. Id. 1 76.
37. The Tribunal issued the Award on August 22, 2016. The Tribunal’s ruling was
unanimous.
38. The Tribunal’s unanimous Award was the culmination of an arbitration proceeding that
lasted more than four years. During that time, the parties submitted over 1400 pages of written
pleadings, 17 witness statements, 12 reports by damages and other experts, and over 1700
exhibits and legal authorities. The parties also participated in ten days of hearings, at which they
made legal submissions and cross-examined witnesses and experts before the Tribunal.

The Arbitral Award
39. The resulting Award is 198 pages and comprises 904 separate, numbered paragraphs.
40. The dispositive section of the Award finds, in relevant part, that “the Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela breached Art. VII of the [Treaty] by expropriating Rusoro’s investment in
Venezuela without payment of compensation,” and that “the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
breached paragraph 6 of the Annex to the [Treaty] by issuing [certain legislative measures,
specifically the July 2010 Resolution] and imposing additional restrictions on the export of
gold.” Award § 904.
41. — The Tribunal rejected Venezuela’s various claims that its actions towards Petitioner’s
investments had been justified, observing that Venezuela “failed to establish that the offending
measures were necessary to reinforce Rusoro’s solvency, to protect the purchasers of gold or to

safeguard Venezuela’s financial system.” Jd. { 509.

10

Case 1:16-cv-02020-RJL Document1 Filed 10/10/16 Page 11 of 14

42. The Award orders Venezuela to pay to Petitioner compensation in the amount of
$967,777,002; plus interest “calculated at an interest rate [per annum] equal to USD LIBOR for
one year deposits, plus a margin of 4%, with a minimum of 4% [per annum], to be compounded
annually,” and accruing from September 16, 2011 until the date of actual payment; and a further
$3,302,500 in legal costs associated with the Arbitration. Id.
{ 904. As of the date of this Petition, the total amount owed by Venezuela under the Award
amounts to $1,227,045,573.
43. Petitioner has requested that Venezuela pay the Award but Venezuela has failed to do so.
THE AWARD MUST BE CONFIRMED
44, Petitioner repeats and re-alleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 43 as if set forth
fully herein.
45. The Award is subject to the New York Convention, which applies to the recognition and
enforcement of foreign and non-domestic arbitral awards, such as the present Award. New York
Convention, art. I(1); see also 9 U.S.C. § 201 (“The [New York Convention] shall be enforced in
United States courts in accordance with this chapter.”).
46. — Article IV of the New York Convention provides that a party applying for recognition
and enforcement of an award “shall, at the time of the application, supply: (a) [t]he duly
authenticated original award or a duly certified copy thereof; [and] (b) [t]he original agreement
[to arbitrate] referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof.” A copy of the Award, duly

authenticated and transmitted by the arbitral tribunal, is submitted herewith.

Case 1:16-cv-02020-RJL Document1 Filed 10/10/16 Page 12 of 14

47. The parties’ agreement to arbitrate is found in Article XIII of the Treaty and in
Petitioner’s submission of its claim to arbitration by accepting the standing offer to arbitrate
found in the Treaty.'? See supra J¥{ 8-19.

48. The Award arose out of a legal relationship that is commercial within the meaning of 9
U.S.C. § 202.

49, Pursuant to Article 20(3) of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, the Award
was made at the place of arbitration, Paris, France. France is a signatory to the New York
Convention (as are Venezuela, Canada, and the United States).">

50. Pursuant to Article XII(10) of the Treaty, the Award is “final and binding” on Venezuela.
In addition, Article 52(4) of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules provides that an
award “shall be final and binding on the parties.” The Award is therefore final and binding
within the meaning of the New York Convention and Chapter 2 of the FAA.

51. Section 207 of the FAA provides that a court “shall confirm” an award covered by the
New York Convention “unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or
enforcement of the award specified in [the New York] Convention.” 9 U.S.C. § 207. None of
the New York Convention grounds for denying recognition and enforcement of an award apply
in this case.'*
