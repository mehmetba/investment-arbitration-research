INTRODUCTIQN

This is the second aw Bidet Award in an arbitration between OAO Tatneft (the “Claimant”) and
Ukraine (the “Respondent”). The dispute arises out of certain events in the period between 2004
and 2007 that resulted in the Claimant’s loss of shareholdings in the company Ukrtatnafta—as
the Claimant contends, in violation of Ukraine’s obligations under the Russia-Ukraine BIT. Ina
Partial Award on Jurisdiction dated 28 September 2010 (the “Partial Award on Jurisdiction”),
the Tribunal affirmed jurisdiction over the Claimant’s claims. The present Final Award

addresses the merits of the case, in respect of both liability in principle and quantum.

The Claimant is OAO Tatneft, a publicly traded open joint stock company incorporated in
accordance with Russian law and has its registered office in the Republic of Tatarstan,' a
constituent republic of the Russian Federation, under the address of Lenin St. 75, Almetyevsk,
Republic of Tatarstan, 423400. Tatneft is one of the largest producers of crude oil in Russia and
produces 80% of the crude oil in Tatarstan.” The Government of the Republic of Tatarstan holds
a 36% interest and special voting rights in Tatneft,’ with its remaining shares being held by

other investors.*
The Claimant is represented in these proceedings by:

Mr. Jonathan I. Blackman, Cleary Gottlieb Steen Hamilton LLP

Ms. Claudia Annacker, Cleary Gottlieb Steen Hamilton LLP
The Respondent is Ukraine, a sovereign State formerly a member of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.* The Respondent acts in these proceedings through the Ministry of Justice,

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 11 December 2007, the Claimant sent a Notice of Dispute to the Respondent requesting that
they open negotiations pursuant to Article 9(1) of the Agreement Between the Government of
the Russian Federation and the Cabinet of Ministers of the Ukraine on the Encouragement and
Mutual Protection of Investments (“Russia-Ukraine BIT”).° As the Parties were unable to settle
the dispute, the Claimant served on the Respondent a Notice of Arbitration and Statement of
Claim dated 21 May 2008 under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
Arbitration Rules, adopted in 1976 (CUNCITRAL Rules”), in accordance with Article 9(2)(c) of
the Russia-Ukraine BIT.

In its Statement of Claim, Tatneft alleged that certain “actions and omissions of [the]
Respondent constitute[d] violations of its obligations to Tatneft under the Russia-Ukraine BIT,
in particular Articles 2, 3(1), and 5 [...]”’ and requested that the Tribunal order, infer alia, the
Respondent to pay upwards of US$ 520 million for unpaid oil deliveries and upwards of
US$ 610 million for the loss of the management rights of the Claimant and its shareholding
interest in Ukrtatnafta.*

Also in the Statement of Claim, the Claimant appointed Professor Rudolf Dolzer as arbitrator.
On 26 June 2008, the Respondent appointed The Honorable Marc Lalonde, P.C., 0.C., Q.C. as
arbitrator. On 24 July 2008, the co-arbitrators appointed Professor Francisco Orrego Vicufia as

the presiding arbitrator. Professor Orrego Vicufia accepted this appointment on 29 July 2008.

The Respondent challenged Professor Dolzer on 27 October 2009. The Secretary-General of the
Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”), who the Parties had designated as the appointing
authority to decide the challenge, sustained the challenge on 19 December 2008. On 16 January
2009, the Claimant appointed The Honorable Charles N. Brower as arbitrator.

Russia-Ukraine BIT (R-2, C-23). In view of the fact that there are some differences between these two
English translations on which the respective Parties have relied in these proceedings, where one or the
other Party has argued following a given version the Tribunal has so noted and decided accordingly. No
issues other than those noted have been argued by either Party to turn on any such difference. The
Tribunal, when quoting from this treaty in this Partial Award on Jurisdiction, has chosen generally to
refer to the translation offered by Respondent (R-2) except as otherwise indicated.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

As previously indicated, the Parties submitted a Joint Factual Chronology in advance of the
hearing, and indicated that this was without prejudice to their respective positions and to
disputed facts that may not have been included therein. The Tribunal includes this Joint Factual

Chronology as Appendix I, and refers to it when necessary below.

EVENTS UP TO THE REINSTATEMENT OF MR. OVCHARENKO

The present arbitration concerns the lawfulness under the Russia-Ukraine BIT of measures

undertaken by the Respondent in relation to CJSC Ukrtatnafta (“Ukrtatnafta”). The creation of

 

U is best d against the background of the di: ion of the Soviet Union in

1991,

the “Kremenchug refinery”) through a direct pipeline from Tatarstan to Ukraine. ” As the
dissolution of the Soviet Union caused Tatarstan and Ukraine to become separate States, the
governments of these countries entered into the Ukrtatnafta Treaty in 1995 and established
Ukrtatnafta,'* a joint venture that was to own and operate the Kremenchug refinery and supply

refined oil products to Ukrainian and international markets.’

The Ukrtatnafta Treaty was signed by representatives of both Tatarstan and Ukraine.” It was
not, however, ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament”! in light of the Ukrainian legal regime that
differentiates between treaties and international agreements, as further explained below. There

is no information on the record as to whether the Treaty was formally ratified in Tatarstan.

Ukrtatnafta was registered as a Ukrainian closed joint stock corporation” and intended to
represent Tatarstan and Ukrainian interests on a 50/50 or parity basis. As set out in the

Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement,”*

the share of Ukraine was mostly allocated to the State
Property Fund of Ukraine (“SPFU”)”’ while the share of Tatarstan was split between the

government” and the Claimant.”

Both the Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement” and the related Presidential Degree No. 704/94
(“Decree No. 704/94")? of the President of Ukraine indicated that Ukraine would contribute the
Kremenchug refinery to Ukrtatnafta, which the SPFU did in 1996,°°

While the Annex to the Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement stated that the Claimant would
contribute fixed assets for the operation of specified oil wells to Ukrtatnafta,”' the Ukrtatnafta
shareholders, in a General Shareholders Meeting held on 10 June 1998, authorized the Claimant
to contribute US$ 31 million instead.” This had the effect of reducing the Claimant’s stake in
Ukitatnafta to 8.613% from the approximately 20% share contemplated in 1995.** Zenit Bank
transferred US$ 30 million to Ukrtatnafta,** and was replaced by the Claimant as a shareholder
on 19 July 2000, as authorized by a General Shareholders Meeting held on 23 May 2000. The
Claimant paid the remaining US$ 1 million directly to Ukrtatnafta on 11 August 2000.°°

AmRuz Trading AG (“AmRuz”), a Swiss company, was admitted as a shareholder in

Ukrtatnafta, AmRuz, and Seagroup International Inc. (“Seagroup”), the American parent
company of AmRuz, executed share purchase agreements in which AmRuz and Seagroup used
promissory notes to obtain a collective 18% share in Ukrtatnafta.** Specifically, AmRuz
tendered 30 promissory notes and Seagroup tendered 35 promissory notes for their shares at
US$ 1 million per note and, in the case of Seagroup, one more promissory note at

2. The Dismissal of Mr. Pavel Ovcharenko in 2004
(a) Undisputed Facts

On 21 September 2004, the Supervisory Board—which was tasked with overseeing the
activities of the Board, the impl ion of sharehold hati and the
protection of shareholder rights“‘—dismissed Mr. Pavel Ovcharenko as Chairman of the
Management Board and replaced him with Mr. Sergei Glushko.‘* Mr. Glushko was the
appointee of Naftogaz to the Management Board, and his appointment was specifically
proposed by Mr. Yuri Boyko, the head of Naftogaz who later become the Minister of Fuel and
Energy of Ukraine."

Mr. Ovcharenko filed an application for reinstatement on 4 October 2094*’ on the basis that
Ukrtatnafta had breached Article 159 of the Civil Code and Articles 40 and 41 of the Labor
Code. ** The Avtozavodsky District Court granted this application on 9 November 2004
(“9 November 2004 Judgment”)?

Mr. Ovcharenko was reinstated as Chairman of the Management Board on 11 November 2004.

approved the Supervisory Board’s 21 September 2004 dismissak of Mr. Ovcharenko, and

instructed the Management Board to consider the reinstatemer®ef Mr. Glushko.”

Three years later, on 5 September 2007, Mr. Ovcharenko applied’ to the Kriukivskiy District

Court for interim measures and a decision” in ion with the 9

2004 Judgment, which he alleged did not specify the necessary enforcement actions.*"

On 26 September 2007, the Kriukivskiy District Court issued the requested interim measures
(“26 September 2007 Interim Measures”) and supplementary decision (“26 September 2007
Supplementary Decision”, and together with 26 September 2007 Interim Measures,
“26 September 2007 Decisions”).*? Noting that the 9 November 2004 Judgment had not yet
been enforced, the Court issued the interim measures pursuant to Article 151 of the Civil
Procedure Code, and authorized Mr. Ovcharenko to proceed with its enforcement.** The Court
further noted that the enforcement of the 9 November 2004 Judgment was rendered impossible
by the absence in this judgment of the necessary actions for an enforcement, and thereby found
“lawful grounds” for issuing a supplementary decision. The supplementary decision authorized
Mr. Ovcharenko to perform the functions of the Chairman of the Management Board, to access
the Ukrtatnafta premises, and to remove obstacles to his resuming control.**

It was allegedly pursuant to the 26 September 2007 Decisions that the activities of 19 October
2007 took place.

The Claimant's Position

PCA 118005 13

The Parties do not dispute the occurrence of the events recounted above, but do characterize and
contextualize them differently. According to the Claimant, this case exemplifies a “raider”
action, which it defines as “the combination of a criminal seizure of property by an organized

group and the involvement of the State through the issuance of unlawful court decisions, the

assistance of enforcement officers of the State and the support of the State actors in the illegal
acts.” °° The Claimant identifies “Privat Group,” a company headed by the Ukrainian
businessman Mr. Kolomoisky, as the corporate raider.” It notes that Privat Group, through its
affiliate Korsan LLC, acquired a “toehold” in Ukrtatnafta in late 2006, in the form of a 1%
shareholding interest that “g[a]lve [Mr. Kolomoisky] a little foot in the door [... to]
systematically take over the Tatarstan side of the company.” *”

Noting that Article 99(3) of the Civil Code gives Ukrtatnafta shareholders the unqualified right
to determine the management of the company,” the Claimant contends that there was no basis
to reinstate Mr. Ovcharenko as Chairman of the Management Board once the shareholders had
decided against him in the General Shareholders Meeting held on 12 Noveinber 2004. In view
of this, the Claimant contends that the theories of labor law on which the Respondent relies for
its argument on the invalidity of the removal of Mr. Ovcharenko are irrelevant. The Claimant
further alleges that this removal by the shareholders supersedes Mr. Ovcharenko’s dismissal by
the Supervisory-Board on 21 September 2004 and the 9 November 2004 Judgment ordering his
reinstatement. The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that Article 99(3) of the Civil
Code relates only to the “temporary suspension” of employees,” and identifies the “temporary
suspension” provision to which the Respondent refers as Article 46 of the Labor Code.® It
stresses that Article 99(3) of the Civil Code refers to the fundamental power of a company to

remove and permanently terminate the mandate of the Chairman of the Board of Management,“

The Respondent's Position

As a preliminary point, and as will be discussed in further detail below, the Respondent

arbitration. It also notes that the Claimant has “failed to show that [Mr. Ovcharenko’s]
2365

reinstatement was illegally facilitated by Ukragme in any way.
The Respondent alleges that the Ukrtatnafta shareholders could not have dismissed
Mr. Ovcharenko during the General Shareholders’ Meeting on 12 November 2004 because his
“reinstatement” the previous day was a “sham.” First, the reinstatement did not fulfill the
requirement in Article 77 of the Ukrainian Law on “Executive Proceedings” and in the then
Charter of Ukrtatnafta that the Supervisory Board cancel its own dismissal order.*’ Second,
Mr. Ovcharenko was impeded from assuming his position as Chairman, given that he was not
notified of his reinstatement, which in any case lasted for only a day.® Third, Mr. Glushko was
referred to as “chairman” several times during the 12 November 2004 General Shareholders
Meeting.” And, fourth, no bailiff had issued a resolution confirming the reinstatement as was
the usual and proper practice.” The Respondent further posits that Ukrtatnafta’s Supervisory
Board, Management Board (save for Mr. Glushko), and shareholders may not even have known

about the 9 November 2004 decision of the Avtozadovsky District Court at that time.”!

But even assuming the validity of the 11 November 2004 reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko, the
Respondent argues that the Ukrtatnafta shareholders’ dismissal of Mr. Ovcharenko on
12 November 2004 violated provisions of the Ukrainian Labor Code.” First, in violation of
Article 36(8), the ismi: Mr. Ovcharenko without that is, without

indicating a ground under the Labor Code or the contract for his dismissal. Instead, the

 

shareholders merely approved the Supervisory Board’s 21 September 2004 termination
decision, which the 9 November 2004 Judgment had established to be inadequate.” The

Respondent further states that the Claimant conflates the proposition that the shareholders can

dismiss the chairman of the management board, with which the Respondent agrees,” with the
separate notion, which is inapplicable in this case, that such dismissal does not require a
showing of good cause.” And second, Mr. Ovcharenko was dismissed before his term expired,
thereby violating Article 36(2), which authorizes the dismissal of an employee once his or her
employment contract ends.”* Moreover, the courts could not have confirmed the (re-)dismissal
of Mr. Ovcharenko as lawful on grounds other than those initially advanced to justify his

termination.”

The Respondent reiterates that Article 99(3) of the Civil Code, which it stresses is a
“sufficiently unclear and ambiguous” provision because it was newly passed then,” does not
authorize the permanent dismissal of employees and relates only to their temporary
suspension.” Alternatively, the Respondent contends that this provision requires the dismissal
of an employee to be predicated on a finding of cause, which was not the case here.*? The
Respondent further points out that there is no evidence that Ukrtatnafta ever presented

arguments based on this provision in prior court proceedings.**

From all of the above, the Respondent concludes that “Mr. Ovcharenko had, at the very

minimum, a tenable claim to reinstatement ....

ii, The Kriukivskiy Court’s Decision to Proceed Ex Parte

The Claimant's Position

76.

The Claimant alleges that the decision of the Kriukivskiy Court to proceed ex parte on the basis
of Article 76 of the Code of Civil Procedure was invalid.®* It argues that the Court disregarded
the requirement in Section 129 of the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine,

No. 1155 of 17 August 2002 (“Section 129”) that the signature of an authorized representative

of Ukrtatnafia establish proof of service pracess, permitting this to be established by an

26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision were sent by ordinary mail and posits there was no
attempt to verify their delivery because “the goal was to create a legal pretext to physically take
over the refinery.”*° The Claimant also alleges that the Court must have known that raiders

frequently use postal notes to fabricate receipt of service of process.*®

The Claimant notes that a further violation of process occurred when the Court, in its
26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision, authorized remedies that Mr. Ovcharenko had not
originally raised in pleadings leading to the 9 November 2004 Judgment.*”

 

78. In its analysis of this court decision and all others, the Claimant highlights the corruption of the
Ukrainian judicial system and notes that to “do a theft by law,” one would “classical[ly]” apply

for an ex parte order in Ukrainian courts which would be enforced against the absent party."

The Respondent’s Position

79. As a preliminary point, the Respondent distinguishes between the general assertion that the
Ukrainian judicial system suffers from instances of corruption (which the Respondent does not
directly reject) and specific allegations of corruption in respect of the judicial decisions
involved in the present case.” It stresses that the Tribunal should focus on the latter and not the
former.°! Moreover, the Respondent characterizes as “staggering” the degree of corruption that
would have had to take place to support the Claimant’s position that a majority of the judicial
decisions underlying this case, many of which were the focus of public interest and scrutiny,”
were wrongly decided.” It further remarks that the Claimant seems to take the position that any

decision favoring it was rightly decided, whereas those that go against its interests were

influenced by corruption and therefore wrong.” In response, the Respondent points out that the
issues that were the subject of the relevant court decisions were susceptible to different
resolutions, and the fact that different resolutions were reached highlights the independence of
the judiciary. ° Tt states that “there was no presentation during the hearing and there is no
evidence in the record of specific corruption infecting any of these particular court decisions,
except to the extent that Tatneft says that it doesn’t like the reasoning in some of the decisions,
and it finds that circumstantial evidence.”*°

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that the Kriukivskiy District Court should have
required the signature of an authorized representative of Ukrtatnafta to prove service of process,
on the basis that Section 129, on which the Claimant relies,” is overridden by the more specific
Article 76(8) of the Code of Civil Procedure, which contains no such requirement.”* Section 129
would, moreover, allow ives of panies to stall court dings i it by
refusing to sign the service of process.” It also notes that the Claimant’s allegation that raiders

frequently fabricate postal notes to prove service of process is unsubstantiated.1°°

Stating that the 26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision simply identified attributes of the
position of Chairman of the Management Board, the Respondent points out that the Claimant
never identified which new powers the 26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision allegedly
granted Mr. Ovcharenko and claimed only that Mr. Ovcharenko had no authority to reassign,

 

unilaterally, responsibilities to himself and his allies, which (according to the Respondent) the

Supplementary Decision did not authorize him to do.'”

iii. The Issuance of Interim Measures under Article 151 of the Code of Civil
Procedure

The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Kriukivskiy Court had no plausible basis for issuing the
26 September 2007 Interim Measures because, in violation of Article 151 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, the difficulty or impossibility of enforcing the 9 November 2004 Judgment ordering
the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko was not established. * In the Claimant’s view,
Mr. Ovcharenko was reinstated on 11 November 2004." The Claimant also points out that the
9 November 2004 Judgment had become binding only on 29 August 2007, as it had been
subject to numerous retrials before then.'* From this, the Claimant notes that Mr. Ovcharenko
waited just weeks before the 26 September 2007 decisions to enforce the judgment.'*

But even assuming that the enforcement of the 9 November 2004 Judgment was difficult or
impossible (which the Claimant denies), the Claimant posits that Mr. Ovcharenko deliberately
chose not to request assistance from the district court in enforcing this decision, as would have

been proper, and instead applied for interim measures to bypass procedural protections. i

The Claimant alleges that the misapplication of the Kriukivskiy Court of Article 151 of the
Code of Civil Procedure violated Articles 212 and 213 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which

require courts to subject the existing evidence to a full and objective analysis and to issue

 

decisions that are properly i or sup by an ii ‘igation of the cit

underlying the parties’ claims.'”

The Respondent’s Position

85.

The R intains that the d failure of L to comply with the

 

9 November 2004 Judgment—from either its issuance date, which is when it became

enforceable, or from 29 August 2007, which is when it became binding '°*—justified the

issuance of the 26 September 2007 Interim Measures under Article 151 of the Code of Civil
Procedure.’ The Respondent alleges that Mr. Ovcharenko had twice been unsuccessful in his
attempts to enforce this judgment, which, among other things, justified the Kriukivskiy Court’s
decision to grant provisional relief." The Respondent also points out that decisions by more
than half a dozen courts ing the of the rei of Mr. Ovek

preceded the 26 September 2007 Interim Measures, and that the Claimant has not alleged that it

 

was precluded from participating in these proceedings.''' Hence there is no evidence that the
26 September 2007 Interim Measures were not reasonably tenable under Ukrainian law or

otherwise issued in bad faith."

The Respondent also points out that the 26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision had the
same legal for L as the 26 2007 Interim which
means that the latter could not have caused harm to the Claimant if the former was a tenable

application of Ukrainian law, which the Respondent argues was the case here.'"*

iv. The Interim Measures As a Form of Post-judgment Enforcement Order

The Claimant alleges that the 26 September 2007 Interim Measures were inappropriate and
were used to enforce the 9 November 2004 Judgment that, after three years, had become

 

moot.'"' By issuing the interim measures decision as an ex parte order and by declaring it
immediately enforceable, the Kriukivsky Court deprived the Claimant of the opportunity to

resist its enforcement."

The Court thus negated the due process protections that the Claimant
would have enjoyed had this judgment been enforced according to Articles 24 and 25 of the

Ukrainian Enforcement Law.'"® The Claimant also submits that the court decision granting the

 

security” standards, which would make it irrelevant to the Claimant’s argument that the Respondent had
breached the Russia-Ukraine BIT, but states that it is addressing this point for the sake of completeness.

26 September 2007 Interim Measures was materially unfair and inequitable since the only stated

reason for its issuance was that the 9 November 2004 Judgment had not yet been executed. ay

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent explains that the 26 September 2007 decision on Interim Measures was issued
as a form of provisional relief to secure the enforcement of the 26 September 2007
Supplementary Decision, which was issued half an hour after the 2007 Interim Measures even if

the 2007 Supplementary Decision did not mention it by name.""*

y. The Proportionality of the 26 September 2007 Decisions

The Claimant’s Position

Eyen assuming that Mr. Ovcharenko’s rights had been violated (which the Claimant denies), the
Claimant alleges that the 26 September 2007 Decisions were disproportionate to any such
violations, in contravention of Article 152(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The 2007
Supplementary Decision placed Mr. Ovcharenko in a position to make far-reaching decisions in
relation to Ukrtatnafta’s operational activities, including decisions that were reserved for the
Management Board and that required the approval of the Supervisory Board under Ukriatnafta’s
constituent instruments.” In the Claimant’s view, there was no legal basis for the Kriukivskiy
Court, in its 26 September 2007 Decisions, to expand Mr. Ovcharenko’s powers, as a monetary
remedy could have made Mr. Ovcharenko whole and he could have returned to the court for

assistance in the enforcement of such remedy.'”°

The Respondent’s Position

90.

The Respondent alleges that the 26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision was authorized by
Article 220(1)(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, because the 9 November 2004 Judgment did

not specify the necessary orders for the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko. ah

As previously stated, the Respondent points out that the Claimant never identified which new |
powers the 26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision allegedly granted Mr. Ovcharenko, and
observes that this decision only identified basic attributes of the position of Chairman of the
Management Board ' and spelled out the legal consequences of Mr. Ovcharenko’s

reinstatement, which is precisely the relief that Mr. Ovcharenko had sought.'7

3. Events of 19 October 2007
(a) Undisputed Facts

Following the proceedings before the Kriukivskiy Court, Mr. Ovcharenko sought enforcement
of the 26 September 2007 Decisions.

To that end, on 12 October 2007, Mr. Yevgeniy Pryshchepa, a bailiff employed by the State
Executive Office within the Ministry of Justice, '** sent Ukrtatnafta by ordinary mail three
resolutions that initiated the process for enforcing writs of execution connected with the

26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision and imposed a deadline of 18 October 2007 for

 

compliance with them.'° On 18 October 2007, Mr. Pryshchepa sent a fourth resolution to
implement the 26 September 2007 Interim Measures ruling.’”°

On 19 October 2007, Mr. Pryshchepa and Mr. Ovcharenko (who was accompanied by other
persons) entered the premises of Ukrtatnafta. While the Parties dispute the precise nature of
what occurred during the course of this day, it is clear that the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko

as Chairman of the Management Board was accomplished by that afternoon.

On 22 October 2007, Mr. Glushko commenced a lawsuit, which would later become Case 2-
336/2008, against Mr. Ovcharenko and Ukrtatnafta before the Avtozavodsky District Court of
Kremenchug, to request that Mr. Ovcharenko be ordered to cease exercising the functions of the
Chairman of the Management Board and that Mr. Glushko be reinstated in this position,!” on
the basis that Mr. Ovcharenko had allegedly taken control of Ukrtatnafta through an illegal

attack premised on a court judgment that had already been complied with.’ Finding that the

reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko was lawful, the Court dismissed this lawsuit on 18 January

2008.7 On 19 March 2008, the Poltava Region Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal of -
Mr. Glushko.’*° The Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected his cassation appeal on 5 November

2008."

(b) Disputed Facts

As a general matter, the Parties disagree on the significance of the events of 19 October 2007.
While the Claimant considers these events leading to the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko to be
central to its claim, the Respondent characterizes them as peripheral and irrelevant to the main
issues in the case’ and argues that the reinstatement of Mr. Oycharenko did not cause any of
the losses for which the Claimant claims compensation.'* In this regard, the Respondent points
out that the Claimant’s direct shareholdings had been invalidated by Ukrainian court
decisions'** before Mr. Ovcharenko was reinstated, which was not in any case the proximate
cause of the share invalidation;'® that the Claimant did not have any indirect shareholdings in
Ukrtatnafta (through AmRuz and Seagroup) at the time that Mr. Ovcharenko was reinstated, as
the Claimant had acquired an interest in them only in December 2007; 136 and that the
Claimant’s claim for lost payments for oil deliveries were based on the actions of Taiz and

Technoprogress in 2009 and unrelated to the events of 19 October 2007.'”

The Respondent also highlights that Privat Group and the Respondent are distinct entities,'**
giving as an example the fact that in the only shareholder meeting that took place after

19 October 2007, Ukraine-controlled Naftogaz voted contrary to the interests of

Mr. Ovcharenko and his management team.’ It states, indeed, that “Naftogaz and Privat Group
»s140

are not blood brothers; they distrust each other intensely.’
The Parties’ disagreement on the events of 19 October 2007 principally concerns the
circumstances of Mr. Ovcharenko’s reinstatement on that day and the legality under Ukrainian
law of the conduct of the bailiff, Mr. Pryshchepa.

i, The Circumstances of Mr. Ovcharenko’s Reinstatement

In the Claimant’s view, the events of 19 October 2007 confirm that Ukrtatnafta was the target of
a corporate raid. The Claimant describes the events of this day as a forcible takeover of
Ukrtatnafta, carried out by the private security forces of Privat Group with the assistance of

Ukrainian government officials, including Mr. Pryshchepa.'**

Relying on video recordings of security cameras (excerpts of which are submitted as evidence in

this arbitration), the Claimant presents the following account of what had occurred:

As seen in the security camera footage, at 9:26am on October 19 approximately 25 men
dressed in plain clothes stormed the third floor of the Ukrtatnafta administrative building,
carrying tools to break through the door to the management offices if necessary. After those
25 men entered the hallway on the third floor, at 9:28am 20 different men wearing uniforms
hurried up the stairs to the third floor of the administrative building, paving the way for 21
more men who followed a minute later, including Mr. Ovcharenko and the bailiffs. In total,
between 9:26 and 9:30am, 66 men, some carrying weapons, were involved in the takeover
of the administrative building at Ukrtatnafta,

The Claimant further contends that locks were broken to enter the premises of the refinery."

To support its characterization of the events as a forcible seizure of Ukrtatnafta, the Claimant
cites various statements by Ukrainian politicians and refers to scholarly writings, press reports,

and reports of NGOs decrying this event.'*

Claimant concludes more generally that the Ukrainian State did not merely turn a blind eye
the events ae 19 October 2007 but actively supported them by its courts’ decisions and
nforcement orders, by sending bailiffs as well as Ministry of Interior troops, and by conducting

e =
“bogus legal proceedings”.

ne Respondent's Position

104. Referring to the video recordings produced by the Claimant, the Respondent denies that there
was any violence or physical confrontation on the Ukrtatnafta premises on 19 October 2007.

105. The Respondent alleges that Mr. Pryshchepa had no connection with the groups of men in plain
clothes or camouflage seen on the video recording and in fact assumed that they were
Ulstatnafia security guards. “® Mr. Pryshchepa—so the Respondent alleges—accompanied
Mr. Ovcharenko onto the Ukrtatnafta premises for the sole purpose of fulfilling his obligation
under Article 30(1) of the Law on Enforcement Procedure of Ukraine to verify that Ukrtatnafta
had received a copy of the resolution initiating enforcement proceedings and that it had not
voluntarily implemented the judgment that was to be executed.’*” The Respondent also points
out that there was a second bailiff, Mr. Sergey Kruhovyi, who had gone to Ukrtatnafta on
19 October 2007 in order to enforce the decision of 9 November 2004."

106. As a result of Mr. Pryshchepa’s visit, Mr. Ovcharenko was provided with the Ukrtatnafta
documents, seals and stamps, and confirmed to Mr. Pryshchepa that Ukrtatnafta’s personnel had
not prevented him from performing his duties as Chairman of the Management Board. The
Respondent thus takes the position that Ukrtatnafia had “voluntarily reinstated
Mr. Ovcharenko.”"?

107. As to the statements by the Ukrainian politicians strongly criticizing the events of 19 October
2007, as adduced by the Claimant, the Respondent observes that these statements were made

during a period in which the details of this day were yet unclear. '*°

PCA 118005

ii. The Legality under Ukrainian Law of the Conduct of the Bailiff
The Claimant’s Position

108. The Claimant argues that the manner in which Mr. Pryshchepa enforced the 26 September 2007
Decisions was contrary to Ukrainian law. First, Article 27 of the Ukrainian Enforcement Law
required Mr. Pryshchepa to obtain the signature of the officials of Ukrtatnafta as proof that the
enforcement resolutions had been properly delivered, which he failed to do.'*! Instead, he sent
the enforcement resolutions on Friday, 12 October 2007, by ordinary mail, which means that
under normal circumstances they would be received after three to four days. According to the
Claimant, there is no evidence in the records that the resolution was received any time prior to

or after 18 October 2007, the due date for voluntary compliance. '*”

109. Second, Article 10.2 of the Enforcement Law states that the sanction for a first instance of non-
compliance with enforcement resolutions is a fine, which would be followed by a new time
period for compliance; a second instance of non-compliance triggers a further fine and the
option of initiating criminal proceedings. The law does not, however, authorize the bailiff to
“forcibly enforce” the resolutions.'** Thus, on 18 October 2007, Mr. Pryshchepa would have

been obliged to establish a new time period for voluntary compliance.'**

 

110. The strictures of Article 10.2 of the Enforcement Law apply especially in the case of the
resolution related to the 26 September 2007 Interim Measures. That resolution was only issued
on 18 October 2007, which made it unreasonable to fault Ukrtatnafta for its failure to comply
voluntarily within one day.'® That said, the Claimant adds that this resolution was in fact never
received by Ukrtatnafta but simply read out to its representatives on 19 October 2007 while the

takeover was ongoing.'*°

The Respondent's Position

111. The Respondent alleges that the manner in which Mr..Pryshchepa enforced the 26 September

2007 Decisions was in accordance with Ukrainian law. Article 27(1) of the Ukrainian

Enforcement Law specifies that resolutions initiating the enforcement of court decisions are to
be sent by ordinary mail, with no further requirement that the signature of the company’s
officials be obtained.'*” Article 30(1) of the Law on Enforcement Procedure requires a bailiff to
verify that the resolution initiating enforcement proceedings has been received and that the
judgment has not been voluntarily implemented, which is why Mr. Pryshchepa visited the

Ukrtatnafta facilities on 19 October 2007.'**

In response to the Claimant’s contention that the 18 October 2007 resolution should not have
been enforced on the following day, the Respondent points out that Mr. Pryshchepa had
determined that that resolution—which prohibited Ukrtatnafta and its employees from
interfering with Mr. Ovcharenko’s entry on the premises or his carrying out his duties as
Chairman of the Management Board—had not yet been received by Ukrtatnafta.
Mr. Pryshchepa accordingly proceeded to read the resolution to the members of the
Management Board.’ When he ascertained that Mr. Ovcharenko was provided with the
company’s constitutive documents, seal, and stamps, Mr. Pryshchepa recorded the voluntary
compliance of Ukrtatnafta with the 26 September 2007 Decisions.’ The Respondent therefore

states that “Tatneft has not shown that Mr. Pryshchepa ‘forcibly’ enforced anything,’

On 19 October 2007, the Deputy Head of the Investigation Division—Head of the Investigation
Unit of the Kremenchug City Department of the Ministry of the Interior, Mr. Oleg Savchenko,
initiated an investigation on whether the events at the Kremenchug refinery of the same day
violated Article 293 of the Criminal Code, which sanctions group disruptions of the public order

(“Article 293 Investigation”).

On 24 October 2007, Mr. Savchenko initiated an investigation of the events of 19 October 2007,
pursuant to Article 357 of the Criminal Code, in relation to an alleged misappropriation of the

seal and stamp of Ukrtatnafta (“Article 357 Investigation”).

i, The Claimant’s Position

117. The Claimant attacks the legitimacy of the said criminal investigations.’ With regard to the
investigation pursuant to Article 293 of the Ukrainian Criminal Code, the Claimant points to the
testimony of Mr. Savchenko, its witness, who states that the investigation was passed from one
department to the next, with no actual investigative activity being undertaken.'® According to
Mr. Savchenko, on 29 October 2007, the Avtozavodsky Regional Court quashed the
investigator’s decision to open the criminal investigation on the basis that the action by private
security forces could not be considered “criminal” because they participated in the enforcement
of a court decision." And when the investigation returned to Mr. Savchenko in late 2007, it

became largely dormant due to the instruction of his superiors that the investigation proceed on

 

a formal basis alone. '®’ As Mr. Savchenko explains, the investigation was officially and
prematurely closed on May 2008, upon the orders of high-ranking government officials. Is
Unusually, the case file was then physically transferred to the Main Investigation Unit of the
Ministry of the Interior in Kyiv, which led Mr. Savchenko to conclude that a high-ranking
official wanted to be sure that the investigation remained closed.’ Accordingly, the Claimant
alleges that it was the absence of a meaningful investigation that allowed the Ministry of the
Interior and the Prosecutor General’s office to conclude that insufficient evidence existed to

bring criminal charges.”

As to the investigation under Article 357 of the Ukrainian Criminal Code, the Claimant states
that this was quashed by the Avtozavodsky Regional Court of Kremenchug within a week after

Mr. Savchenko employment and an outright bribe to assist the raiders, and conveyed to
Mr. Savchenko that a substantial amount of US$ 25 million had been paid to the Prosecutor’s

office to ensure the failure of the investigations.’”

ii. | The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent points out that the Claimant relies exclusively on the testimony of
Mr. Savchenko to discredit the investigations. '" It alleges that Mr. Savchenko’s
characterization of the 19 October 2007 events as a raider attack is a personal view that conflicts
with the official investigative findings. '% Moreover, in the Respondent’s view, Mr.
Savchenko’s alleged encounter with Mr. Bergelson raises questions about the credibility of Mr.
Savchenko, as he neither reported the encounter nor initiated criminal proceedings with regard
to it.”

The Respondent alleges that the testimony of Mr. Savchenko concerning the Article 293
Investigation is incomplete, as it does not include his interviews with the bailiffs present at
Uk:tatnafta on 19 October 2007 and fails to mention his non-involvement in the investigation
for a certain time.'”’ The testimony also misrepresents the facts, such as in its description of the

Mr. Ovcharenko of trespassing on Ukrtatnafta although he was accompanied by a bailiff and

authorized by the execution writs to be at the Ukrtatnafta premises at that time."

The Respondent alleges that the testimony of Mr. Savclienko on the Article 357 investigation is
similarly unreliable, given that he neither addresses the 31 October 2007 Avtozavodsky Court
Judgment stating that he had breached articles in the criminal code in initiating the

investigation'™ nor discloses that his conduct caused the cancellation of this investigation.‘

The Respondent concludes that the Claimant has not established that the above-mentioned
investigations were terminated either improperly or without good reason, or that the said
investigations uncovered actions that would be considered criminal under the Ukrainian

Criminal Code."

5. Presence of the Ministry of the Interior Troops at Ukrtatnafta
(a) Undisputed Facts

It is undisputed between the Parties that the Kremenchug refinery was subject to special
protection following the events of 19 October 2007. More specifically, on 24 October 2007,
Military Unit 3059 of the Internal Troops of the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine began

providing security services at the refinery.’**

(b) Disputed Facts
i, The Claimant’s Position

According to the Claimant, the Respondent installed members of the State security services in

order to facilitate Mr. Ovel i and to the raiders’ ion of
the refinery. In the Claimant’s view, the presence of these troops is evidence of the

Respondent’s active complicity in the illegal actions of the corporate raiders. *°

ii, | The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent states that military forces and other military organizations—such as the
Ministry of the Interior troops—are authorized to carry out commercial activities in Ukraine,
which include the provision of security services, as was the case for Ukrtatnafta.’® Hence, the

provision of security services to Ukrtatnafta in this case cannot be considered “irregular” or

“abusive” conduct of the State.'*”

6. The Management at Ukrtatnafta after 2007
(a) Undisputed Facts

Immediately after Mr. Ovcharenko was reinstated as Chairman of the Management Board on
19 October 2007, he issued an order physically banning Mr. Glushko from the Kremenchug
refinery. In the following weeks, the management of the company was restructured under the
leadership of Mr. Ovcharenko through various orders that he issued, and he retained numerous

consultants and advisors to assist him in managing the company.'**

Following 19 October 2007, all four members of the Management Board who had been
nominated by the Tatarstan shareholders were either dismissed or forced to resign.'*? The
Claimant declined to appoint their replacements. It appears (according to the Claimant’s
submissions, which on this point were not contested by the Respondent) that key management
roles, including those in the financial department, were reassigned either to Mr. Ovcharenko

himself or to managers close to him.’

In February 2010, the first and only General Shareholders Meeting since the events of October
2007 was held. The shareholders notably resolved to validate the share auctions at which the
shares of the Tatarstan parties were sold; to confirm Mr. Ovcharenko as Chairman of the
Management Board; and to elect Mr. Kolomoisky and his associates as members of the

Supervisory Board.’ As a result of these resolutions, six of the eleven seats were held by

To the Tribunal’s knowledge, Mr. Ovcharenko remains Chairman of the Management Board to

the present day.

(b) Disputed Facts

is The Claimant’s Position

Specifically, the Claimant alleges that the 19 October 2007 order banning Mr. Glushko from the
refinery deprived Mr. Glushko of the rights and benefits to which he was entitled as a full
member (if not Chairman) of the Management Board.'*° Moreover, ignoring the necessary
Supervisory Board approval, Mr. Ovcharenko allegedly expanded his own power and assigned
positions to his allies while marginalizing the other Management Board members and the
employees loyal to Tatarstan.'”” Finally, the Claimant alleges that Mr. Ovcharenko vested
substantial executive powers in the newly hired consultants and advisors, which in turn caused
the dismissal or forced resignation of the Management Board members nominated by the

Tatarstan shareholders.’

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s allegation that the reallocation of management positions
was either a normal reorganization following a change in management, or caused by the alleged
lack of cooperation of the board members, and points out that this occurred within days of

Mr. Ovcharenko’s reinstatement.'”?

The Claimant also alleges that Mr. Ovcharenko mismanaged Ukttatnafta’s assets to the point of

putting the company on the “brink of financial and operational collapse,” and states that the

financial results show that Ukrtatnafta was profitable befoue 2007 but not after Mr. Ovcharenko

had taken over.”

Lastly, the Claimant alleges that, under Mr. Ovcharenko’s leadership, Ukrtatnafta ceased to
provide it with detailed financial reports on a monthly basis, as it had done since January
2003." The Trade Representation of the Republic of Tatarstan in Ukraine wrote letters to the
Ukrainian government authorities on behalf of the Claimant and the Republic of Tatarstan to

protest this situation, but to no avail.’

ii. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s depiction of post-2007 Ukrtatnafta. It criticizes
the Claimant for its primary reliance on—and alleged misrepresentation of—the witness
statement of Mr. Vladimir Fedotov, the Claimant’s nominee to the Management Board.
Moreover, the Respondent observes that the Claimant did not complain to the relevant

Ukrainian authorities at any point, despite its claims of illegal behavior.?™*

The Respondent states that the initial lack of cooperation of Ukrtatnafta’s directors following
the events of 19 October 2007 forced Mr. Ovcharenko to take on their management duties. He
subsequently, however, enjoyed good working relationships with the other members of the
Management Board, save for Mr. Fedotov, who kept to himself. 7% While the members of the
Management Board eventually all resigned, the Respondent points out that the Claimant could

have appointed replacement members, but failed to do so.

The Respondent also rejects the Claimant’s allegation of Mr. Ovcharenko’s mismanagement of

.d.?°” Rather, the Respondent points out that it was the Claimant that cut

assets as unsubstantiate
off its oil supply to the Kremenchug refinery to retaliate for Mr. Ovcharenko’s reinstatement,

and it was this that jeopardized the financial situation of Ukrtatnafta.””* The Respondent adds

that Mr. Ovcharenko had found Ukriatnafta in a financially desolate state at his reinstatement,”
specifically pointing to payables in excess of UAH 2.6 billion owed to Taiz and

Technoprogress, the Claimant’s intermediary suppliers.”"°

137. Lastly, the Respondent does not deny that Mr. Ovcharenko appointed consultants and advisors,

but points out that the Claimant has alleged no wrongdoing on their part"!

Ts The Tribunal’s Considerations Concerning the Facts of Mr. Oveharenko’s
Reinstatement and Related Events

138. The Tribunal turns now to the discussion of the facts as alleged by the Parties with a view to
establish which in its assessment has been the backdrop of the dispute submitted to its

resolution.

139. Like many projects of the kind characterizing the creation of Ukrtatnafta it is not difficult to
ascertain that it started out in the best spirit of cooperation, as reflected in the Ukrtatnafta Treaty
and the Incorporation Agreement, as well as in the respective decrees issued by the Tatarstan
and Ukraine governments. The purpose of ensuring parity was quite evident in the arrangements
concerning the distribution of shares and the contributions to be made by each party, in essence
consisting of oil wells and production facilities in Tatarstan and the Kremenchug refinery in the
Ukraine. This multinational arrangement was undoubtedly the best available option at the time
following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the separation of its constitutive territorial and

political entities.

140. In the short run, however, it appears that such purposes would not be easily attained. While it is
quite probable that there were objective technical, economic and legal difficulties to
contributing the Tatarstan oil wells as originally envisaged, it is also relevant to note that the
alternative contributions that were finally authorized by the shareholders were in amounts that,
given the magnitude of the business projected, were not very impressive. US$ 31 million for
Tatneft, US$ 30 million for AmRuz and US$ 35 million for Seagroup are the figures in the
record. Moreover, the arrangements leading to these contributions, notably the payment of
US$ 1 million by Tatneft and the intra-group transfer of shares held by Zenit Bank valued at

US$ 30 million, like the issuance of promissory notes by AmRuz and Seagroup and the

143.

extension of payment dates, are expressive of this difficulty. Questions also arose as to the

valuation of the Kremenchug refinery.

It can also be noted that during the start-up period intra-corporate relations appeared to be
harmonious but this began gradually to change. The Tatar shareholders were more experienced
in the oil business, as evidenced by the strong participation of Tatneft in the project, and as a
result acquired greater influence in the management of Ukrtatnafta. Although Tatneft was
nominally a minority shareholder, the incorporation of AmRuz and Seagroup and the strategic
and voting alliance that ensued among the three shareholders led to greater influence in the
decisions of the company. Also the Tatar Ministerial participation in the shareholding was quite

naturally associated to Tatneft and its related companies.

This situation could not be to the liking of the Ukrainian side, as a consequence of which a
power struggle ensued within Uk that led to the i dismissal,

and reiterated dismissal of the Chairman of the Management Board, Mr. Pavel V. Ovcharenko,
as well as to long-lasting lawsuits and court decisions examined above. This power struggle was
at the heart of the events of 19 October 2007, which as noted the Claimant characterizes as a
“raider” action and the Respondent as the peaceful reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko in
compliance with court decisions. Scant reference to a letter of resignation of Mr. Ovcharenko in

one testimony does not find support in the documents in the record of this case.”

One other fact needs to be taken into account for the proper understanding of the dispute before
the Tribunal. Beginning in 2007 a group of companies associated with the Privat Bank, which in
turn were all directly or indirectly related to Mr. Igor Kolomoisky, an influential businessman
with extensive interests in the oil industry and other business activities in Ukraine, developed an
interest in gaining control over Ukrtatnafta, which had a central role in that sector. One
company in that group by the name of Korsan acquired in 2007 a modest 1.15% of the
shareholding. Following complex corporate arrangements and litigation, by 2010 Korsan had
become the owner of 47.08% of Ukrtatnafta’s shareholding, which together with other related
interests attained up to 56% of the shareholding, with the State Property Fund of Ukraine
holding 43.05%.”"* The Tatarstan, Tatneft, AmRuz and Seagroup participation was gradually
diminished until it became totally extinguished. These arrangements notwithstanding, the

Respondent rightly points out that at no point has the Ukrainian State ceased to be a minority

int 24 Mr. K isky, as will be di: d further below, was called as

a witness by the Tribunal at the oral hearing. ,

At this point the original influence exercised in the company by the Tatarstan and related
shareholders, including Tatneft, was reversed and it was the Ukrainian shareholding that
acquired prominence in the control and management of Ukrtatnafia. Both Parties believe that
Ukrtatnafta was badly mismanaged while under the control of the other party, an issue that was
also at the heart of the confrontations between shareholders.”* These developments were quite
naturally resisted by Tatneft.”"° In fact, it is of interest to note, as the Respondent does, that it
was Tatneft that first complained to Ukraine about AmRuz and Seagroup’s acquisition of shares
in Ukrtatnafta because of having only nominally paid for them with unsecured notes and
because of the effect this together with other factors had on the alteration of the parity principle,
a view that later changed in light of its strategic alliance between Tatarstan entities and Amruz
and Seagroup.”"’ The view has been expressed, however, that AmRuz and Seagroup were at
least originally controlled by the Ukrainian side.”'* What was at stake in these discussions was
not the form of the capital contributions by different shareholders but how this would determine
which side, Ukraine or Tatarstan, would control the company, which also explains why later
Tatneft would support AmRuz and Seagroup so as to avoid a change of control.”””

As will be discussed further below, at this point as a consequence of the modification of the
capital contribution the parity principle was reversed in favor of the Ukrainian shareholding, and

such principle had thereby become defunct.

It is against this complex background that the Tribunal must now turn to establish whether there
was in fact a corporate raid and the inextricably related question of the dismissal and

reinstatement of Mr, Ovcharenko.

‘The Tribunal has carefully examined the evidence submitted and can conclude that the events of '

220

19 October 2007 at the Kremenchug refinery were not that peaceful.” Both witness statements

 

and the video recording of the events show that in fact there was a forceful takeover of the
Kremenchug refinery and the administrative offices. The not insignificant number of people
appearing in those recordings forcing their way into the premises, some in uniform, is credible
evidence that a physical occupation took place on that date. While it is not clearly established
that weapons were available to such occupants neither can this feature be ruled out, and this was
certainly the case when Ministry of the Interior troops were called to secure the refinery a few
D days later on 24 October 2007.

148. The Tribunal has also noted the various statements submitted by the Claimant as to the
existence of corporate raids and similar takeovers in Ukraine, including the statements of
political and business leaders and international agencies.”! While: this is undoubtedly a
recurrent phenomenon it cannot be relied upon as evidence that every single corporate
acquisition is the result of some form of wrongdoing either by private individuals and entities or
entailing the connivance of State agencies and the judiciary. This can only be established on a
case by case basis and the Tribunal will do so next in the context of the discussion about the

dismissal and reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko and the courts’ decisions related thereto.

149. The controversy relating to the dismissal and reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko as Chairman of

Ukrtatnafta’s Management Board needs to be discussed in the context of the basic principles

 

ing corporate and their ion in the appli law. The Tribunal has no
doubt that the dismissal of the Chairman of the Management Board is a decision that can be
adopted without hindrance by the corporate governing bodies if for some reason they are
unhappy about his performance. The fact that the dismissal of Mr. Ovcharenko was decided in
the first instance by the Supervisory Board on 21 September 2004 and ultimately endorsed by
the General Shareholders Meeting on 12 November 2004 responds to this principle as it is
expressly recognized in Articles 99 and 159 of the Civil Code.

150. The choice of who is considered the most qualified Chairman of a company or its Chief
Executive Officer is recognized by Article 99(3) of the Ukrainian Civil Code allowing for the
suspension of members of the executive body of a company from their duties.””? While the

Respondent has argued that such power refates to “temporary suspension” and not a permanent

dismissal, the Claimant’s view that such temporary suspension is addressed by Article 46 of the
Labor Code is convincing. In fact, this last Article addresses events such as coming to work
intoxicated with alcohol and other such rhisconduct of an employee which is very different from
a corporate decision concerning the performance of duties of its executive officers. But even if
the general provisions on the termination of labor agreements embodied in Articles 40 and 41 of
the Labor Code are taken into account, there is evidently a difference between the ambit of
application of the civil code and that of labor legislation. Moreover, the dismissal of the
Chairman of the Management Board by resolution of the Supervisory Board was explicitly
included in Mr. Ovcharenko’s employment contract in accordance with Article 36 of the Labor

Code.”

Whether it might have been preferable for the decision to terminate Mr. Ovcharenko to have
stated specific reasons is one thing, but the fact that even without this explanation dismissal is
the exercise of a valid right is quite another. On the other hand, while the Respondent’s
argument to the effect that Articles 99 and 159 of the Civil Code do not provide that compliance
with the Labor Code is not required,”” it is also true that neither does the Civil Code provide
that the subject matter of the Labor Code ought to prevail over essential provisions of contract
law. The fact that Article 36(8) of the Labor Code is referred to by the Order to dismiss
Mr. Ovcharenko does not alter the effects of the Civil Code.

It has been noted that the Avtozavodsky District Court ordered the reinstatement of
Mr. Ovcharenko on 9 November 2004. It was held by the Court that the power to order such
dismissal was not within the competence of the Supervisory Board but of the General
Shareholders Meeting and that further the Supervisory Board had been enjoined from making
decisions concerning the appointment and termination of members of the Management Board,
including its Chairman. Assuming that this was a defect of such dismissal, the fact that it
responded to the company’s policy is not to be doubted as in fact was confirmed not long
thereafter by the very General Shareholders Meeting held on 12 November 2004 where

Mr. Ovcharenko was again dismissed following his reinstatement a day earlier.

As the Court chose to base its decision on the Ukrainian Labor Code and not the Civil Code, it
could not of course address the question of the powers of corporate governance found at the

origin of the dismissal but only the grounds governing employment under the Labor Code,

which as noted is a different matter. Even though the reasoning of the Court was not to the
liking of Ultatnafta’s 1 the i d Mr. Ovek ko as an
employee on 11 November 2004 following the order of the Court to this effect. As also noted,
the General Shareholders Meeting held on 12 November 2004 once again removed
Mr. Ovcharenko and elected Mr. Glushko as the new Chairman. The Tribunal cannot fail to
notice that there was in this sequence of events a kind of cat and mouse strategy, but in the end
the Court’s decision was formally complied with, although whether Mr. Glushko, the Acting
Chairman, duly discussed the implications of the litigation with the Management Board is

226

subject to important doubt.”° The Respondent believes that the reinstatement was a “sham” and

that it failed to comply with various procedural requirements of Ukrainian law.

154. This corporate governance lasted in any event for the three years that followed until new court
decisions intervened in the ongoing dispute between the main protagonists of the corporate
struggle. Other interests also had a role to play in this process, this being in particular the case
of Naftogaz, a Ukrainian State-owned company that in fact has resisted the efforts of the Privat
Group to acquire control of Ukrtatnafta, as evidenced by the fact that Naftogaz voted against the
appointment of Mr. Ovcharenko at the General Shareholders Meeting of 5 February 2010.””

155. The next issue for the Tribunal to address is the question of the ex parte Supplementary
Judgment and the ex parte interim measures issued by the Kriukivskiy District Court on
26 September 2007, both issued in the context of the Court’s understanding that the
reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko, ordered on 9 November 2004, had not been implemented and
that a Supplementary Judgment was required so as to indicate the specific measures to be taken
to that effect. Both decisions were appealed by Ukrtatnafia and further proceedings were
initiated by Mr. Glushko seeking protection of his rights as Chairman of the Management

Board, but none of them succeeded.

156. Such decisions were followed by four writs of execution issued by Bailiff Yevgeniy Pryshchepa
initiating enforcement proceedings sent by ordinary mail giving a short delay for voluntary
compliance and in one case for immediate enforcement. Whether the signature of an authorized
representative of Ukrtatnafta was required or not as a matter for service of process to be legally
valid, a point on which the Parties disagree, does not detract from the fact that Ukrtatnafta was

not on notice of the ex parte proceedings taking place at this stage and that in any event the

The Supplementary Judgment, in addition to underlining Ukrtatnafta’s obligation to grant
Mr. Ovcharenko access to the company’s premises, specifically included within his powers that
of making decisions concerning the organizational, operational and economic, financial and
other activities of the company. The Parties, as also noted above, have different views about
whether this latter aspect of the decision granted Mr. Ovcharenko new remedies not discussed in
the proceedings leading to the 9 November 2004 decision on his reinstatement and whether on
the whole they might have entailed measures out of proportion in respect of the reinstatement

issue and the possible remedies to such situation. In any event, the fact is that Mr. Ovcharenko’s

 

i was ii ‘icat iated with the aim of achieving a complete takeover of the

company’s management, which in fact he proceeded to effect swiftly.”

158. The di ion about the 26 September 2007 1 ry and the decision on
interim measures is essentially based on the issue of whether there was or not a valid
enforcement of the 9 November 2004 decision ordering Mr. Ovcharenko’s reinstatement. While
as noted the Claimant believes that this was positively the case, in the Respondent’s view, and
as contained in the 26 September 2007 Decisions, there had been no such valid enforcement.
The question was discussed at length during the litigation that followed Mr. Ovcharenko’s
alleged reinstatement on 11 November 2004 that culminated on 29 August 2007 when the order

became binding.

159. The Claimant’s view that if there had been difficulties with or even the impossibility of carrying
out such enforcement the proper procedure would have been to apply to the District Court and
not to request separate interim measures of an ex parte nature in violation of Article 151 of the
Code of Civil Procedure is convincing. This is so, first, because as a matter of fact the
reinstatement order had been enforced on 11 November 2004, even if on a purely formal basis
as shown by the second dismissal of Mr. Ovcharenko the following day, and this again was a
clear expression of the policy and decision irrespectively of whether the resolutions were issued
by the Supervisory Board, the Chairman of the Management Board or the General Shareholders

Meeting, a point also subject to much discussion between the Parties.

Next, and more importantly, the Claimant’s view is convincing because under such procedure
the Parties would have had the possibility of fully arguing their case even though this was done
in prior litigation.%° In any event it is to be noted that in the Respondent’s view the
26 September 2007 Supplementary Judgment would have had the same legal consequences as
the Interim Measures, but still this does not detract from the fact that ex parte decisions can only
be justified on very exceptional bases and strictly following the requirements laid down under
Article 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which does not appear to have been the case here.
The chronology of these decisions, showing that the interim measures were issued thirty
minutes earlier than the Supplementary Judgment they were supposed to enforce, does not help

to explain a logical legal sequence of these acts, which is normally the other way around.

It was the purported enforcement of the Supplementary Judgment and the interim measures of
26 September 2007 which led to the events described in connection with the occupation of the
Kremenchug refinery. It is at this point that the role of the bailiff Mr. Yevgeniy Pryshchepa in
these events becomes particularly relevant. It has been considered above that the various writs
of execution issued in respect of that enforcement were not quite transparent and timely and did
not follow the strict requirements of Articles 24 and 87 of the Ukrainian Law on Enforcement
Proceedings.”! The Claimant has also noted that even a supplementary judgment is subject to
strict requirements under Articles 11 and 220 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which again do

not appear to have been duly observed in this case.

It has also been considered that the occupation of the premises does not appear to have been as

232

peaceful as described by the Respondent and the bailiff.” While it is true that physical violence

appears to have been used on the occasion of the events of 19 October 2007 in a limited way,

? the role of the bailiff

concerning in particular security guards and breaking into the premises,
was not as simple as providing for and verifying the enforcement in question.* What has been
described as the voluntary reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko by the Ukrtatnafta officials present
during those events is not credible as it followed various measures of coercion, in particular
preventing such officials from leaving the premises. The fact that a few days later the Minister

of the Interior’s troops were called in does not corroborate that characterization of a voluntary

reinstatement either, particularly in view of the fact that the units called were from a rather

distant region.”

163. The reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko was swiftly completed that very day and the lawsuits and
appeals commenced by the departing Chairman Mr. Glushko were successively dismissed by
the Avtozadovsky District Court of Kremenchug and the Poltava Region Court of Appeals. An
unsuccessful takeover on the part of Mr. Glushko on 23 October 2007 has also been alleged by
a witness for the Respondent.”* As will be examined further below Ukrtatnafta’s management

 

was ipletel d following Mr. Ovcharenk i It must also be noted
that both the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko and the reorganization of the company were
closely linked to the interests of Korsan as explained in Mr. Kolomoisky’s statement at the

hearing.?”

164. An issue related to these events is that concerning the criminal investigations that were initiated
because of the complaints lodged about the alleged illegality of the enforcement proceedings,
disruption of public order and misappropriation of Ukrtatnafia’s seal and stamp. The
investigations discussed carlier were either quashed by the Avtozavodsky Regional Court or

closed by administrative decision.

165. Two key witnesses appeared in connection with these investigations, Mr. Oleg Savchenko, the
investigation officer, on behalf of the Claimant, and Mr. Yuri Bergelson, a lawyer for
Mr. Ovcharenko, who appeared as a witness called by the Tribunal. While the first was of the
view that the investigations were impeded by the officers in charge of the intervening agencies
so as to prevent the findings and completion, including allegations of the Prosecutor having
been paid US$ 25 million,” the second witness vehemently denies any such allegations”? and
affirmed that Mr. Savchenko had misapplied the provisions of Articles 293 and 357 of the

Criminal Code governing such investigations, which was the true reason for their termination.

166. Besides the fact that the two witnesses do not appear to love each other, the Tribunal finds that

their respective credibility is quite limited. Mr. Savchenko’s account of a meeting purportedly

held with Mr. Bergelson is rather vague, and the allegations of the latter attempting to influence
him and referring to bribes cannot be adequately established on this basis. Mr. Bergelson’s
testimony is even less credible as he repeatedly offered contradictory versions of his role in

these investigations and proceedings and how he became involved in them. ™°

Be that as it may, the Tribunal cannot fail to notice that the investigations were not carried out
in spite of the fact that the complaints about the occupation and taking over of the Kremenchug

refinery offered enough elements that would justify the thoroughness of these proceedings.

The facts discussed above show that immediately following his reinstatement Mr. Ovcharenko
proceeded to the complete reorganization of Ukrtatnafta, both at the managerial level and as
regards the composition of the governing organs of the company. While this fact has not been
disputed, the reasons motivating such measures have been a matter of total disagreement

between the Parties.

Whether or not the company had been in a state of mismanagement under the former Chairman,
Mr. Glushko, and whether there were serious financial consequences arising from such
situation, or whether the reality was exactly the opposite,” the measures taken in order to ban
Mr. Glushko from the refinery do not help the Respondent’s argument that all decisions taken
by the incoming Chairman were purely a matter of managerial reorganization. Besides his role
as former Chairman of the Management Board, Mr. Glushko had nonetheless remained a
member of such organ and was thus, as argued by the Claimant, deprived of his corporate rights

and relieved of his duties.

Moreover, it appears well established that the incoming Chairman considerably expanded his
powers and proceeded to appoint a number of consultants and advisors responding to his

242

authority,“ a plan that appears to have been prepared in advance of the 19 October 2007

2
events.

The aggregate of such decisions led to the dismissal or resignation of the members of
the Management Board nominated by the Tatarstan shareholders and a number of staff members

related to the Tatarstan interests in the company.

171. The Respondent’s argument to the effect that there was a lack of cooperation of such board
members is credible as the confrontation and corporate struggle between shareholders and
management continued unabated during all this period, but remedying such situation should not
have been achieved by measures of the kind discussed but by means of the mechanisms of
corporate governance, including the Supervisory Board and ultimately the General Shareholders
Meeting. Equally serious is the fact that the Claimant’s allegation that the new management
ceased to provide it with the monthly financial reports appears not to have been contradicted, a
decision which quite clearly interferes with essential corporate rights of shareholders. Whether
the Claimant complained of this irregularity to the authorities or whether the Tatarstan Trade

Representative in Ukraine protested does not detract from the fact that such irregularity existed.

B. ANNULMENT OF SHAREHOLDINGS IN UKRTATNAFTA
1. Court Decisions on the Claimant’s Shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta
(a) Undisputed Facts
i Case 32/1

172. The events discussed were followed late in 2007 by proceedings before the Ukrainian courts
concerning the Claimant’s legal position as a shareholder in Ukrtatnafta—and in particular the

propriety of the Claimant’s acquisition of its Ukrtatnafta shares

173. In fact, on 19 December 2007, the Prosecutor commenced proceedings on behalf of the
Government and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy of Ukraine before the Kyiv Economic Court
under Case 32/1 for, among other things, the invalidation of the shareholder resolutions that had
approved the modification of the capital contribution of the Tatarstan shareholders and the
liquidation of Ukrtatnafta."' Korsan filed a statement of claim in support of the Prosecutor’s
claim on 13 March 2008. In bringing this claim, the Prosecutor contended that he did not
learn of the violations that were the subject of Case 32/1 until he received an 28 April 2007

letter from the then Minister of Fuel and Energy, Mr. Boyko, who complained, following an

tigation of Ukriatnafta carried out by the Ukrainian Audit Control Board,™* that the

ation of the authorized share capital of Ukrtatnafta violated Ukrainian law.47

On 4 September 2008, the Kyiv Economic Court accepted the Prosecutor’s arguments on the
applicable three-year statute of limitations and found that the claim was not barred by ie
declared that the change in the form of the capital contribution of the Tatarstan shareholders and
the modification of Ukrtatnafta’s constituent documents with regard to it was illegal, and
thereby set aside the 1997 and 1998 General Shareholders Meeting resolutions with respect to
those issues;”” and ordered that Ukrtatnafta be cancelled from the trade register and
liquidated.” The reasoning behind the Court’s decision to set aside the 1997 and 1998 General
Shareholders Meeting resolutions authorizing the change in form of the capital contribution of
the Tatarstan shareholders is similar to that employed by the Economic Court of the Poltava
Region in Case 17/178 on 3 November 2009, which will be discussed in detail below.”!

Several parties appealed this decision to the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal, namely the
Prosecutor, on 10 September 2008;** Naftogaz, on 11 September 2008;”° the Cabinet of
Ministers of Ukraine, on 12 September 2008; and the Claimant, also on 12 September
2008.75

On 14 May 2009, the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal confirmed the renewal of the limitation
period; upheld the nullification of the 1997 and 1998 General Shareholders Meeting resolutions
and all versions of the Incorporation Agreement that approved the modification in the form of
the contribution of the Tatarstan shareholders; and reversed the order that Ukrtatnafta be
cancelled from the trade register and liquidated.” The Higher Economic Court confirmed this

judgment on 20 August 2009.7” On 27 October 2009, the Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the

ii, Case 17/178

Before Case 17/178 is discussed in detail, it should be noted that Ukrtatnafta filed a similar
claim—in what was to be Case 17/l—against the Republic of Tatarstan, Infosistema (the new
share register of Ukrtatnafta that was controlled by the Privat Group), and ING Bank Ukraine
(the nominal holder of the Republic of Tatarstan’s shares in Ukrtatnafta) on 18 December 2008
to invalidate the shareholdings of the Republic of Tatarstan based on the alleged illegality of the
modification of its capital contribution to Ukrtatnafta from “[a] parcel of shares in economic
entities of oil refining complex [...] the right to develop oil deposits, and other state-owned
assets of enterprises and organizations of the Republic of Tatarstan”! to shares in OAO

Tatnefteprom, one of the founding Ukrtatnafta shareholders from Tatarstan.”

The procedural history of Case 17/1 is as follows. On 13 March 2009, the Economic Court of
the Poltava Region “decide[d] to reinstate the period of limitations for Ukrtatnafta,” and
invalidated the share purchase agreement for the purchase of 28% of Ukrtatnafta’s shares by the
Republic of Tatarstan.”* The Kyiv Interregional Economic Court of Appeal reversed this
decision on 22 July 2009. On 25 August 2009, the Higher Economic Court granted
Ukrtatnafta’s cassation appeal and reversed the decision of the Kyiv Interregional Economic
Court of Appeal.” On 3 November 2009, the Supreme Court rejected the cassation appeal filed
by the Republic of Tatarstan against the judgment of the Higher Economic Court.” As the

Respondent has pointed out, the Claimant does not make any claim in respect of Case 17/ 4°"

which is why it will not be discussed in further detail here.

Case 17/178 was commenced on 31 August 2009, when Ukrtatnafta sued the Claimant and
other parties before the Economic Court of the Poltava Region to seek invalidation of the
Claimant’s purchase of Ukrtatnafta shares, based on the holding in Case 32/! 1.7 To establish
that its claim was not barred by the applicable statute of limitations, Ukrtatnafia argued that it
was unable to challenge the validity of the General Shareholders Meetings and share purchase
agreéments relating to the form of the contributions of the Tatarstan shareholders prior to the

decision in Case 32/1.°

On 29 October 2009, the Deputy President of the Economic Court of the Poltava Region
dismissed the challenge that the Claimant had launched against one of the judges hearing the
cases,” in which the Claimant had alleged that the particular judge was manifestly biased
against the Claimant as he had decided against the Republic of Tatarstan in Case 17/1."

On 3 November 2009, the Economic Court of the Poltava Region accepted Ukrtatnafia’s
arguments on the statute of limitations and found that its claim was not barred by it; held that
the shareholder resolutions accepting a modification of the Claimant’s contribution from fixed
assets to cash were unlawful; and invalidated the Claimant’s share purchase and ordered the

return of its shares to Ukrtatnafta.”””

Specifically, the Court found that the Claimant’s contribution of fixed assets relating to the
operation of specified oil wells—tike the stated and actual contribution by the SPFU of the
Kremenchug refinery—was essential to establishing Ukrtatnafta and to fulfilling the objective
for its establishment.’” The resolution during the General Shareholders Meeting dated 10 June

1998 that permitted a modification in the Claimant’s contribution to the authorized capital of

Ukrtatnafta therefore violated the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, the Ukrainian Constitution, Decree
No. 704/94, and the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 487."""

On the basis that the Claimant did not pay for its shares in the form specified by the above-
mentioned authorities, the Court found that the Claimant had breached Article 8(3) of the Law
of Ukraine “On Securities and Exchange,” which conditions the transfer of shares on the full
payment for them.?” It thus set aside Option Agreement No. 77 of 20 May 1998 between
Ukrtatnafta and Zenit Bank, the 16 June 2000 Share Purchase Agreement between Ukrtatnafta
and Zenit Bank, and the 15 August 2000 share transfer on the basis of which the Claimant had

obtained its shares, and ordered the Claimant to return its shares to Ukrtatnafta.?”*

The Kyiv Interregional Economic Court of Appeal affirmed this ruling on 23 December
2009.7” The Higher Economic Court dismissed the Claimant’s cassation appeal of this ruling to
the Supreme Court on 10 February 2010.” And on 26 May 2010, the Higher Economic Court
dismissed the appeal of the Claimant against its 10 February 2010 ruling.””

sgubstantial discretion” but not unfettered discretion,” with the former requiring the support of

“material reasons,” such as “objectively insurmountable” obstacles that prevented a party

from bringing a lawsuit to defend its rights.’ There were no “material reasons” nor

“gbjectively insurmountable” obstacles in Cases 32/1 and 17/178.*°

187. Turning to Case 32/1, the Claimant alleges that, as several Ukrainian government officials
attended the 1997 and 1998 General Shareholders Meetings, the approval of the shareholder
resolutions authorizing the changes to the amendment documents triggered the running of the

three-year prescription period.”*’ Moreover, the Claimant observes that the Prosecutor sought to
annul Article 5 of Ukrtatnafta’s 1995 Incorporation Agreement in Case 8/604 which

commenced in 2002; therefore, his statement that he learned of the relevant amendments to the

Ukrtatnafta documents only in July 2007 was clearly and demonstrably false.*** Finally, the

5 August 2010 application of the Cabinet Ministers of Ukraine (“CMU”) to reopen Case 32/1

stated that the Prosecutor “knew that [he] had valid reasons for filing a claim over violations of

procedure of incorporation of [Ukrtatnafta] on 25 November 2003,” which was the date of a

letter from the Prosecutor to the Ukrainian Parliament, in which the Prosecutor highlighted a
resolution of the General Shareholder Meeting of 19 July 1997.” Neither the Prosecutor nor
the Ministry of Justice disclosed these facts, and the Kyiv Economic Court rejected an
application by Seagroup that the Prosecutor be ordered to produce documents relating to the

2002 and 2004 inspections of Uk«tatnafta, which would have cast doubt on the Prosecutor’s

claim that he had no knowledge of the relevant facts before 2007.”

188. Turning then to Case 17/178, the Claimant states that there was no plausible basis for the
Economic Court of the Poltava Region to have found that the Prosecutor had only learned of the
source of the violation of Ukrtatnafta’s rights either when Case 32/1 was reviewed in 2008 or
during a 2007 audit; it points out that Ukrtatnafta had known of its constituent documents, the
relevant resolutions of the General Shareholders Meetings, the shareholder transactions it had

entered into, and its shareholder contributions for years.” The Claimant rejects the argument
that the Respondent could not have sought the annulment of the share purchase agreements with
Zenit Bank and Tatneft until Case 32/1 was decided””> by identifying the legal alternatives open
to the Respondent that would have resulted in its desired outcome—the annulment of the share

i ithout the of the General Meetings’ resolutions.”*

 

The Respondent's Position

189. The Respondent alleges that the Prosecutor was only informed of the violations that were the
subject of Case 32/1 when he received a letter from Mr. Boyko on 28 April 2007,” after which
he promptly launched an investigation and filed Case 32/1.”°° It dismisses as irrelevant the
Claimant’s speculation on Mr. Boyko’s motives for writing this letter.’ While the Prosecutor
had investigated the 1998 General Shareholders Meeting, which amended the Ukrtatnafta
constituent documents in a prior case, Case 8/604, as well as the devaluation of the Kremenchug
refinery, that case had not involved the compatibility of the changes of the Claimant’s
contribution with the Ukrtatnafta Treaty.”°* Similarly, the 25 November 2003 letter of the
Prosecutor to which the Claimant referred was written in response to a request that the
Prosecutor investigate matters relating to the alleged privatization of the Respondent’s
shareholding in Ukrtatnafia, which did not involve the change in the Claimant’s contribution
and could not therefore support the contention that the Prosecutor examined the circumstances
of Tatneft’s purchase of Ukrtatnafta’s shares at that time.” Finally, the CMU had no basis to
claim in its 5 August 2010 application to reopen Case 32/1 that the Prosecutor knew of the
violations resulting from the change in the Claimant’s contribution as early as 2003.°” There is
as such no basis for the contention of the Claimant that the Court had accepted the Prosecutor’s

representations even if suspecting them to be false.*”"

. Referring to Article 29(2) of the Economic Procedure Code, the Respondent argues that the

knowledge of both the SPFU and other public officials could not be imputed to the Prosecutor
because his function is to protect State interests without representing any State organ,°*” which

means that only the knowledge of the Prosecutor is relevant for the statute of limitations."

The Respondent concludes by stating that, given the discretion enjoyed by the Ukrainian courts
in assessing time periods, the Prosecutor would have known that his initiation of Case 32/1 was

5° and maintains that the statute of limitations only commenced

at least reasonably tenable,
when the Prosecutor had completed his investigation and was satisfied that Ukrainian law had

been violated.*”

As to the acceptance by the Kyiv Economic Court of Case 32/1, the Respondent maintains that
there is no evidence that the belated filing of the Prosecutor was in bad faith;°° contends that

conduct of the Prosecutor;*”” and notes that the Claimant ignores the discretion enjoyed by the
courts in determining the application of the statute of limitations.*** The Respondent also
contends that the exercise of judicial discretion must be assessed on a case-to-case basis, given
that there is no statutory or jurisprudential definition of materiality—specifically, that a
“material reason” to extend a prescription period does not translate to the impossibility of filing

a case within the said period—and in this case, the discretion was properly exercised.°°

As to Case 17/178, the Respondent explains that the Economic Court of the Poltava Region
extended the applicable prescription period based on the decision in Case 32/1,*"° which

established that Ukrtatnafta’s rights had been violated.*!' Moreover, while Ukrtatnafta was not

~ with regard to the first point, the Claimant clarifies that Article 2 of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty did

not define the nature and content of the “principles and provisions” to be adopted by the
319

Governments or make these principles an integral part of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty or legislation,
and the Ukrainian Presidential Decree did not create obligations for the Claimant or any of the
other Tatarstan shareholders.*”° Moreover, Resolution No. 487 of 4 July 1995 of the CMU did

not address the form of contributions of the Claimant.*”!

. The Claimant alleges that the fifteen-year life span of Ukrtatnafta and its profitability for a time

rebut the argument that the change in the contribution from the Claimant and the Republic of
Tatarstan made it impossible for Ukrtatnafta to achieve its objective™ or that the Claimant’s
contribution of oil equipment was an essential condition for the creation of Ukrtatnafta.*” It
also points out that, if it were true that Ukraine would not have agreed to sign the Ukrtatnafta
Treaty and the Incorporation Agreement had it known that the intended contributions of the
Tatar parties would not be honored, then the Ukrtatnafta Treaty would have addressed this

matter.?**

In support of its position that Ukrainian Jaw allowed Ukrtatnafta’s shareholders to amend the
company’s Incorporation Agreement and Charter without governmental approval, 5 the
Claimant refers to Article 12 of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, which does not impose the requirement
of governmental approval for the amendment of Ukrtatnafta’s constituent instruments*”® and the
Ukrtatnafta Treaty and Decree No. 704/94, which do not authorize the Ukrainian and Tatarstan
Governments to approve Ukrtatnafta’s constituent documents or to veto the General
Shareholders Meeting’s decisions amending them. At the same time, Article 8(5) of the
Ukrtatnafia Treaty does empower the General Shareholders Meeting to approve the constituent
documents.’ The Claimant further points out that neither the Ukrtatnafta Treaty nor Decree

No. 704/94 contains “basic principles” concerning the required contributions of the shareholders
or otherwise defines the content of Ukrtatnafta’s constituent documents.

The Claimant observes that the Respondent did in fact approve the 1997 and 1998 General
Shareholders Meetings’ resolutions through the SPFU* and high-ranking Government officials

who attended them and/or served on the Supervisory Board at those times.*°

The Claimant also characterizes the Courts’ conclusions on Article 8(3) of the Law of Ukraine
“On Securities and Stock Exchange” as “grossly inconsistent and completely divorced from the
facts that the courts themselves [had] ascertained” because on the one hand, the Courts
acknowledged that the Claimant had paid US$ 31 million in cash as its contribution to
Uk«tatnafta’s capital, while on the other hand, the plain language of Article 8(3) makes clear
that its application could have been triggered only if the Claimant had made no contribution at

all.32!

The Claimant’s expert on Ukrainian law confirms that, under Article 48(2) of the Ukrainian
SSR Civil Code, the Ukrainian courts were obliged to grant restitution to Tatneft after
invalidating its share acquisitions. According to the expert, courts had to apply the provision
proprio motu, irrespective of whether any party actually requests restitution, as decided by the
court in the Dekon case.*” Accordingly, a court that invalidates an agreement, should apply
Article 48(2) of the Ukrainian SSR Civil Code and “return the property to the parties whose
contract has been subject to invalidation.”**? The Claimant highlights that the Economic Court
of the Poltava Region in fact did not order Ukrtatnafta to return the cash payment the Claimant

made, which amounted to US$ 31 million.*™*

Lastly, the Claimant questions the entry into force of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty—on which the
Ukrainian courts relied heavily—as a matter of public international law as well as Ukrainian

law. First, under public international law, an international agreement is an agreement between

two States which would not be the case when it comes to the Ukrtatnafta Treaty.**> Second,
according to Article 13 of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, it would enter into force as of the date of the
last notification of compliance by the Parties with their domestic procedures. The Claimant
notes that there is no evidence in the records that such notifications had been exchanged.***
Third, as a matter of Ukrainian law, it is undisputed that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was never
approved by the Ukrainian Council of Ministers under Article 9(b) of the (then applicable) 1993
Law on International Agreements.**”

Countering the Respondent’s position, the Claimant argues that, if the Ukrtatnafta Treaty had
come into effect, the Ukrainian courts would not have been competent to address its alleged
violations since Article 11 of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty provided that all disputes relating to its
interpretation and fulfillment should be resolved by way of negotiations and consultations.
Consequently, if Ukraine “really believed [that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty had been violated], it
would have been required under Article 11 to address the matter with the Government of

Tatarstan; not unilaterally through its own domestic judicial system”.***

However, the Claimant does not deny that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was “de facto followed up toa

The Claimant adds that, in any event, it is immaterial whether the Ulatatnafta Treaty became
effective or not since it was ded by the i it and its

amendments. It argues that the Tribunal has already decided that these later agreements are the
decisive legal instruments in the present case. Relying on paragraphs 188 and 195 of the
Tribunal’s Partial Award on Jurisdiction, the Claimant maintains that Ukrtatnafta’s shareholders
unanimously decided that the Incorporation Agreement and its subsequent amendments would
ultimately regulate the nature and size of the contributions to be provided by the Tatarstan
shareholders. *“° According to the Claimant, the Respondent has not shown any basis for

revisiting the decisions made in the Partial Award on Jurisdiction.**"

The Respondent’s Position

208.

209.

The Respondent argues that the invalidation of the Claimant’s direct shareholdings in Case
17/178, as foreshadowed by Case 32/1, was reasonably tenable as a matter of Ukrainian law. It
points out that there were seven court decisions on the merits in respect of Cases 32/1 and
17/178, and that the judges involved in each decision took the position that the change in the
Claimant’s capital contribution to Ukrtatnafia violated the Ukrtainafta Treaty and Ukrtatnafta’s

other founding documents.*"

  

As a preliminary point, the Respondent states that, while it had accepted the possibility that the

specific details concerning the contribution of the Tatarstan shareholders may have been

varied,*?

it would not have agreed to sign either the Ukrtatnafta Treaty or the Incorporation
Agreement had it known that the contribution of the Tatarstan shareholders would have been
other than oil fields and fixed assets related to oil wells, as was the case here." This intention is
reflected in the provisions of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty that concern the contribution from the Tatar
side.>”> Stating that the fundamental purpose of Ukrtatnafta was “to serve as an inter-state
economic complex with combined production and refining capabilities,” the Respondent further
alleges that it donated the Kremenchug refinery to Ukrtatnafta on the basis that it would receive
oil ownership rights in Tatarstan oil deposits and related oil production equipment, which would
have the effect of ensuring a minimum supply of oil to the Kremenchug refinery.*"° In Case

32/1, the Kyiv Economic Court accepted this view.”

As a further preliminary point, the Respondent discusses whether the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was
effective under international law or whether it was incorporated into domestic Ukrainian

legislation.**

"The Respondent first clarifies that “ander the Ulrainian’regting; [the Uketainafta Treaty] was
effective as a matter of international law that binds the parties.”*” First, Article 13 of the

Ukstatnafta Treaty, which pegs the effective date of the treaty as the “date of the last notice of

compliance by the Parties with their domestic procedures,” is not clear about whether the treaty
requires any further domestic procedure for it to take effect, but the Parties to the treaty did
agree on immediate implementation without such a precondition.>*° Second, while Article 2(3)
of the Ukrainian Law on International Treaties assumes that international treaties are concluded
on behalf of the Government of Ukraine, the Respondent explains that the distinction between
those treaties and those that are concluded on behalf of Ukraine is merely internal and of no
significance under international Iaw.**' In any case, the CMU specifically cited Article 2(3) in
their orders with regard to the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, which therefore places this treaty in the
category of an international or intergovernmental treaty.*” Third, the CMU implemented the
treaty, thereby signaling that the requirements of Article 13 of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty had been
met from the Ukrainian side.** The Respondent points out that the Republic of Tatarstan also
considered the intergovernmental treaty to be effective and did not otherwise invalidate or
withdraw from it.***

The Respondent then argues that, even if the Ukrtatnafta Treaty is not considered effective
under international law, it still forms an integral part of the domestic legal order of Ukraine
through the “doctrine of reference.”.** The Respondent cites to the decisions in Cases 32/1 and
17/178 that constantly upheld the proposition that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was an integral part of
Ukrainian legislation. It also points to several provisions in Ukrainian law that support this
position, such as Article 4 of the Law on Enterprises, which states that “[i]f an international
treaty or an international agreement to which Ukraine is a party establishes rules other than
those set out in the Ukrainian legislation on enterprises, the rules of the international treaty or
agreement shall apply,” and which does not specify that the ratification of a treaty is a
precondition to its incorporation into domestic law.°*” While a separate provision, Article 17 on
the Ukrainian Law on International Treaties, states that “[i]nternational Agreements of Ukraine

that are concluded and properly ratified constitute an integral part of the national legislation of

Ukzaine ...”, the Respondent clarifies that Article 17 refers to a category of intergovernmental

treaties that is separate from the category covered by Article 4 of the Law on Enterprises.***

_ As for Article 9 of the Ukrainian Law on International Treaties, which states that “[t]he

international agreements of Ukraine which are not subject to ratification, but are subject to

approval, are approved as follows...,”*

the Respondent makes the following points. First, it is
not clear whether Article 13 of the Ukttatnafta Treaty requires approval in the form of some
domestic procedure in order for it to be effective.* Second, Article 9 does not indicate that
every treaty must be ratified or approved to be effective, and in fact, most of Ukraine’s treaties
are not ratified or approved.**' Third, the CMU does not issue separate approvals of treaties that
it has signed, which means that the category in Article 9 that actually requires a separate
signature by the CMU after its approval signature is a “null set.”* And fourth, the approval for
signature of the CMU of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, in conjunction with the powers of the CMU
under the relevant legislation, operate to make the Ukrtatnafta Treaty binding as part of

Ukrainian domestic legislation.

Turning then to the relevant cases, the Respondent first states that the courts in Cases 32/1 and
17/178 applied the systemic method of interpretation that is recognized by Ukrainian law*®* and
not the “literal and fragmentary reading of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and related governing
documents” allegedly employed by the Claimant and its experts in their consideration of the
issue of the Claimant’s shareholdings.*® It then discusses the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and other
related documents that governed the establishment and operation of Ukrtatnafta—which it
stresses is not an ordinary Ukrainian joint stock company but is instead an inter-state economic

complex that was established by a treaty“*’—to establish the importance placed on the form of

a

contributions by the founding members, which support the necessity of requiring governmental

approval for any material change to the company’s founding documents.*”

. The Respondent also rejects the Claimant’s argument that the consent of the Ukrainian

Government was indirectly given through SPFU.* In the Respondent’s view, the SPFU’s
approval at the 1997 and 1998 General Shareholders Meetings did not imply the approval of
these changes under the Ukitatnafta Treaty, and moreover, the SPFU exceeded its authority in

approving amendments to the Ukrtatnafta founding documents.°*

The Respondent states that the Ukrainian courts’ analysis and application of Article 8(3) of the
Law of Ukraine “On Securities and Stock Exchange” in Case 17/178 was reasonably tenable, in
that it was the change in the form of the Claimant’s contribution to Ukrtatnafta that violated
Article 8(3)’s requirement that it pay for its shares, as the said article requires proper—and not
just any—payment, which translates to payment in the form prescribed in Ukrtatnafta’s
governing documents,*”°

The Respondent highlights the multiplicity of judges, at different courts, who considered the
merits of both Cases 32/1 and 17/178.°"

. The Respondent further clarifies that the Economic Court of the Poltava Region did not order

the restitution of the cash payment made by Tatneft for its shares because Tatneft did not seek
such restitution, for what the Respondent describes as strategic reasons.°*” The Respondent
rejects the reliance of the Claimant’s expert on the Dekon case as controlling authority for the
proposition that courts should grant restitution even absent a request from the defendant that it
do so, by explaining that Dekon contradicts the general trend of court decisions;*” that the
Claimant’s expert was only made aware of this case as a result of the Respondent’s expert

report;*” that the Ukrainian system does not recognize precedent in court cases;*” and that a

points out that Tatneft could have filed a counterclaim in the Ukrainian court proceedings to

seek restitution, but failed to do so.°””

2. The Tribunal’s Considerations Concerning the Annulment of Tatneft’s
Shareholding in Ukrtatnafta

The Tribunal turns now to the discussion of the complex facts concerning the proceedings and
decisions of the Ukrainian courts in respect of the validity of the Claimant’s direct and indirect
shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta as summarized above. This was yet another step in the process of
corporate confrontation surrounding this case and one in which, besides the role of the courts,
that of the Prosecutor, several government officials and the Korsan group becomes a salient
feature of its developments. Although the Respondent is of the view that the events related to
the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko are peripheral to the main issues with which the arbitration
is concerned in light of the evolution of the case, and that there is no proximate cause between
such events and the alleged damages, the Tribunal tends to see a rather close link between all
such events as they were a part of the corporate struggle described and the end goal of the

control of Ukrtatnafta changing hands.

(a) The Issues Concerning the Amendment of Tatneft’s Capital Contribution

Proceedings seeking the i of Ukrtatnafta’ i pproving the
modification of the capital contribution of the Tatarstan shareholders and the valuation of
Ukstatnafta were commenced as it has been explained by the Prosecutor before the Kyiv
Economic Court on 19 December 2007 giving birth to Case 32/1. The issue arose as a
consequence of a letter addressed to the Prosecutor by the Minister of Fuel and Energy dated
28 April 2007 explaining that, in light of investigations carried out, the formation of the
authorized capital of Ukrtatnafta was in violation of Ukrainian law. The said Minister believed
that by revaluing the amount represented by Ukraine’s contribution of the Kremenchug refinery
to a figure three times smaller, and increasing the value of the Tatarstan-contributed shares by
means of a changed capital structure, the control of the company appeared to be the objective

pursued.*” The Tribunal must also note in this respect the Claimant’s argument to the effect

Letter from the Minister of Fuel and Energy to the Public Prosecutor General of Ukraine, dated 28 April

that the letter in question was sent by Minister Boyko, who prior to his ministerial position had
been appointed Chairman of Ukrtatnafta’s Management Board in 2001, and was based on the
alleged illegalities brought forward by a Member of Parliament whose identity is not
disclosed*” and whose letter was not produced,** aspects that cast doubt on the independence
of the Ministry in the events that the letter triggered. Because of Mr. Boyko’s prior appointment
as Chairman of Ukrtatnafta’s Management Board it is likely, as Claimant argues, that he knew

long before he sent the ministerial letter about the alleged illegalities.***

In considering the question of the invalidation of the shareholders’ resolution the Tribunal is
mindful of two facts of importance. The first is that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty of Incorporation of
4 July 1995 had envisaged that the Tatarstan contribution to the company would consist of a
guaranteed supply of oil with a certain minimum specified, just as the Agreement on
Incorporation and Operation of Ukrtatnafta did. More specifically, the Presidential Decree of the
Republic of Tatarstan dated 13 December 1994°* envisaged as a capital contribution the shares
it owned in certain economic entities concerned with oil production and the right to develop oil
deposits, among other state-owned assets, so as to match the capital contribution of Ukraine, all
of it in light of the concept of creating an integrated oil production and refining industry with
the equal participation of Ukraine and Tatarstan. A number of other supplementary agreements
and Orders had also relied on the equality of the contributions of the founding members, as the
Kyiv City Economic Court concluded in its judgment of 4 September 2008 in Case 32/1 and as
the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeals confirmed in its decision of 14 May 2009.

The second fact that needs to be taken into account in the consideration of this issue is that in
the end such form of capital contribution was changed because of various alleged technical,
economic and legal difficulties and as it no longer appeared to respond to the intent of
establishing a full cycle of oil extraction and processing extending from the oil wells in
Tatarstan to the Kremenchug refining in Ukraine. As a result the Tatarstan shares in Tatneft and
Tatnefteprom that were transferred were valued at US$ 103.575 million, the Tatneft
contribution at US$ 1 million and the Zenit Bank shareholdings in trust for the latter company at
USS 30 million. In turn the supply of oil to Ukrtatnafta did not meet the amounts specified on a

yearly basis.

In spite of the resolutions in question having evidently departed from the original conception of -
the ‘project, the Tribunal cannot fail to note first that such modifications were unanimously
approved by the shareholders. More importantly, a number of high level officers of the Ukraine
government were present at the General Shareholders Meetings held in 1997 and 1998 and
concurred in the unanimous approval of the modifications introduced. Among such officials
there was the Minister of Fuel and Energy, the Director of the State Property Fund and the
Deputy, Minister of Finance. A list of twenty-four Ukrainian officials participating in
Ukrtatnafta’s Supervisory Board through 2007 was provided by the Claimant at the hearing

during closing arguments.

The Prosecutor’s statement of claim filed in Case 32/1°* explaining that the initiation of the
proceedings found its justification in “the injury caused to the economic interests of the State by
the inefficient use of state-owned assets” does not seem to find support in the facts noted. It is
not quite credible that each and every State official participating in the approval of the
resolutions would have been unaware of such inefficiency had that been the case. Although the
view that there is no evidence of the approval of the amendments in question by the Cabinet of
Ministers of Ukraine or another authorized state agency has been put forth, the fact that all
relevant ministries and agencies participated in the shareholders meetings noted appears as a
sufficient manifestation of governmental authority to that effect. The Claimant argues with good
reason that such official participation in the approval of the resolutions in question was enough
to trigger the three-year prescription period that will be discussed below. The view expressed to
the effect that such officials could only provide their comments in the pertinent meetings in a

personal capacity is simply not tenable."

. At this point the Tribunal must note two troubling points in the developments talting place in

connection with the amendment of capital contributions. The first is that the Prosecutor had
already investigated Ukrtatnafta’s foundation in the period 2002-2003, that is several years after
the amendments had been introduced, but it was not until 2007 that proceedings were initiated
on the argument that the letter to the Prosecutor by the Minister of Fuel and Energy following
an audit control had prompted this action. While the delay might not be entirely unusual in a
public service, this fact coincides with the second troubling point, namely that Korsan, the
company controlled by the Privat Group, had acquired in January 2007 a 1% shareholding in

Ukrtatnafta. From this point onwards the role of the Prosecutor in this case appears increasingly

(b) The Issues Concerning the Statute of Limitations

i 2 ‘The arguments discussed became particularly relevant in the context of the discussion of the

statute of limitations by the courts. The Prosecutor’s statement of claim in Case 32/1 affirmed
that he had not been aware of the violations of Ukrainian law allegedly taking place in
connection with the amendment of capital contributions until he received the letter noted of the
Minister of Fuel and Energy in 2007, thus justifying the Prosecutor’s submission that the three-
year limitation period established in Article 71 of the Ukrainian Civil Code should not apply.
This statement of claim was promptly supported by Korsan in a submission to the Kyiv
Economic Court. This Court concluded in its judgment of 4 September 2008 that it was
“obvious” that the Prosecutor only learnt of such violations on the occasion of the Minister’s

letter and a report from the Main Auditing Office.

225. The Tribunal finds that the matter was less than obvious.*** This is so first because the Claimant

has produced evidence to the effect that the Cabinet of Ministers in an application before the
courts of 5 August 2010 concerning Case 32/1 stated that the Prosecutor General’s office knew
all the circumstances relating to Ukstatnafta’s authorized capital “back in 2003.”°°° The
Tribunal cannot fail to note that the very fact that this application opposing annulment
originated in the Ukrainian government is demonstrative of how the Respondent itself was not
satisfied with the conclusions of the courts. It is also significant that the Kyiv Economic Court
denied Seagroup’s petition for the production of documents concerning the inspections of
Ukrtatnafta by the Prosecutor General’s office that were conducted during the preceding years.
A letter from the Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine dated 25 November 2003,** also
submitted in evidence by the Claimant, shows that in fact the Prosecutor had been monitoring
the process of capital contributions with anticipation, including the Prosecutor’s Claim filed in
2002 in Case 8/604, in which invalidation of the Ukrtatnafta Agreement was sought insofar as

that in seeking to annul Article 5(5) of the Incorporation Agreement in 2002 in respect of

AmRuz and Seagroup, the Prosecutor necessarily knew then about the question concerning
paragraph 3 of the same article authorizing Tatneft to pay in cash its capital contribution just as

it authorized Tatarstan to pay its own contribution with shares in Tatnefiprom.*”

In its judgment of 4 September 2008 the Kyiv Economic Court concluded that because the
Prosecutor had only learnt in 2007 about the breach of Ukrainian law allegedly committed by
the change in the capital contributions of the Company the excuse invoked by the Prosecutor for
missing the limitation period was admissible and the rights of the State were liable to protection.
This Tribunal does not sit as a reviewer of the decisions of Ukrainian courts but it must
nonetheless examine the merits of those excuses in light of their relevance to the resolution of

the instant dispute.

Article 71 of the Ukrainian Civil Code provides unequivocally for a general limitation period of
three years for the protection of infringed rights. In accordance with Article 76 of that Code
such period begins from the date the right to claim comes into existence, with specific reference
to the right of action beginning from the date that person is aware or should have known of the
violation of its rights. It is only when the limitation period is missed for a material reason that
the action may be admissible and the right in question shall be entitled to protection, as provided
for under Article 80(2) of the Civil Code.”

The Claimant has convincingly explained in this context that the late letter of the Minister of
Fuel and Energy to the Prosecutor is not a material reason justifying the dispensation of the
limitation period because it does not show that there could have been an “objectively
insurmountable” obstacle preventing a party from bringing an action in defense of its rights. The
Respondent’s argument to the effect that there is no need to show objective impossibility as a
ground for the renewal of the limitations period™”" is at odds with the specific provisions of the
Civil Code on this matter. While the Respondent rightly points out that a material reason is not
the same as impossibility and that the two should not be equated, as Mr. Toms states in his

reports and testimony, **” it does not appear to be enough that a court will consider itself
satisfied that there is a valid excuse for failing to file on time as this is an entirely discretionary

appreciation that cannot be reconciled with the need to apply a legal standard. This could lead to

the extreme view that the protection of rights does not require the affected person to comply

with any formal condition, including compliance with the limitations period,*’ whereas total

discretion of the courts, as a legal expert maintains, is incompatible with a legal standard.

The Tribunal considers, moreover, that it is the duty of the Prosecutor General to keep abreast of
situations which have been the subject of an investigation and in this case the evidence adduced
to the effect that he had investigated the capital contributions as early as 2002-2003 is
demonstrative of the fact that such officer knew, or should have known, of the alleged problems

subject to a late claim in 2007.

The Respondent’s argument to the effect that the knowledge of public officials could not be
imputed to the Prosecutor because his function is to protect State interests without representing
any State organ, and consequently only his knowledge is relevant for the purposes of the statute
of limitations,*”* does not appear to be in accordance with the institutional role of public officers
whose duties go far beyond any question of personal knowledge, particularly in view of the
broad role the Prosecutor has under Ukrainian law.*”* Moreover, when the Prosecutor is acting
on behalf of a claimant there would be no reason for granting that officer a more privileged
role.*”” The legal experts, Mr. Toms and Mr. Belyanevich, have debated the issue of whether
there is in Ukraine legal support for the concept of imputed knowledge,*”* but this is a question

that is closer to a factual determination than to any legal standard.

Neither is the argument that earlier investigations had not been concerned with the question of
capital contributions under the Treaty and consequently that there could have been no
knowledge at that time of the issues with which the Prosecutor was concerned as from 2007 any
more convincing. In fact, while again it is true that the questions investigated in 2003 were not

as complete as those prompting the 2007 investigation,”

it is also true that at that early stage
the issue of amending the capital contributions was already quite prominent in the structure of
Ukstatnafta. The Prosecutor could not have ignored it or assumed that an oversight on his part

would not have consequences.

235,

The Tribunal does not doubt that in assessing time periods the courts enjoy a measure of
discretion but this has its-limits as established by law." The statute of limitations is one such
important limit and cannot remain open indefinitely as would be the consequence of requiring
personal knowledge of the Prosecutor to trigger it as the Respondent believes to be the case.""!
Even less so could the application of the limitation period in cases filed by the Prosecutor in the
interests of the State be treated with greater deference than in any other case,” nor could it be

treated in a privileged manner.

If these were isolated cases one might consider that the interpretation of the courts is tenable as

 

far as the limitation period is d, just like the Prosecutor must be to act in
good faith, but in the context of this dispute the facts and circumstances on which it rests show a
string of actions seeking the same corporate objective within the struggle for the control of
Ukstatnafta that has been explained. In spite of there being no definition of materiality under the
Jaw or jurisprudence, as argued by the Respondent, it appears not to be unwarranted to conclude
that the requirement of materiality was not strictly examined and that its normal legal meaning

was certainly exceeded in the conclusions of the courts.

Having declared the action admissible, the Court then proceeded to rule that the change in the

capital contributions and the corresponding modification of Ukrtatnafta’s constituent documents

were illegal, set aside the i of the General Meeting d. and
ordered the cancellation of the company from the trade register to be followed by liquidation.
The various appeals and other actions noted before the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal, the
Higher Economic Court and the Supreme Court did not change the essence of the decision of
4 September 2008, except that the order to cancel the Company from the trade register and to

liquidate it was reversed.

These judicial developments were followed soon afterwards by various other actions before the
courts, all of them concerning different aspects of the changed capital contributions to
Ukrtatnafia. Case 17/1 was filed by Ukrtatnafta-on 18 December 2008 requesting the
invalidation of the shareholdings of the Republic of Tatarstan in the Company in view of its
contribution having been changed from Ukrtatnafta’s shareholdings in the economic oil refining
complex of that Republic to shares in Tatneftprom. Mr. Ovcharenko signed this filing on behalf

of Ukrtatnafta. The various court decisions concerning this claim that have been noted above

again dealt with the renewal of the limitation period and the invalidation of the share purchase
agreement of Tatarstan in Ukrtatnafta which, with the exception of one decision reversing prior

findings, reiterated in essence the approach that had been followed in Case 32/1.

The most prominent of the cases that followed was Case 17/178 where most of the issues
discussed were again decided by the courts on grounds similar to those considered in Case 32/1.
Tn this new case the Economic Court of the Poltava Region decided on 3 November 2009 that
the actions brought by Ukrtatnafta against Tatneft seeking the invalidation of the latter’s
purchase of shares were not time barred because the claimant did not have the power to seek the
annulment of such purchase agreements until Case 32/1 was decided. This proposition is not
supported in light of the facts of the case as Ukrtatnafta, even if it might not have been able to
bring an action against its own shareholders, could have sought the protection of its rights at any
material time following the share transactions believed to be in breach of the law and in

particular could have challenged the contracts emanating from those resolutions,“

The Tribunal cannot fail to note the Claimant’s argument to the effect that Ukrtatnafta, in
seeking the invalidation of Tatneft’s share purchase agreement, ignored the resolutions passed
by the General Meeting of its own shareholders, which is hardly credible and could thus not

support the view that the company learnt of such an event years later.

The Prosecutor’s arguments in justification of this late filing are identical to those made earlier
in Case 32/1 insofar it affirms that it had only become aware of the breach of Ukrainian Jaw in
2007. This argument was also accepted by the Economic Court of the Poltava Region which
allowed the case to proceed. Again here, however, the Claimant in the instant case convincingly
explains that the Prosecutor knew of the amendments as early as 2002 in the context of his
initiation of Case 8/604 against AmRuz and Seagroup seeking to annul Article 5 of
Ukrtatnafta’s 1995 Incorporation Agreement. This fact is clearly indicative that there could be
no material reason to renew the limitation period as required under the Civil Code. The issue of
a material reason and impossibility to file on time will be discussed further below in light of the

expert legal reports of Mr. Toms and Mr. Belyanevich.

(©) The Discussion of the Alleged Illegality of Amended Capital Contributions
and Invalidation

The Court in Case 17/178 reached the conclusion that the shareholders’ resolutions accepting
the modification that allowed Tatneft to substitute cash payments for the oil wells and supply
originally envisaged by the Ukttatnafta Treaty and other enactments was unlawful and
consequently invalidated Tatnefi’s share purchase, ordering the return of such shares to
Ukrtatnafta. Contribution in kind, in the view of the Court, was as essential as the contribution
of the Kremenchug refinery made by the SPFU in due course. In addition, the Court concluded
that because the shares bought had not been paid in full, as required by Article 8(3) of the Law
of Ukraine “On Securities and Exchange,” this condition had also been breached and on this
basis it set aside the 1998 Option Agreement between Ukrtatnafta and Zenit Bank and the
transfers that led to Tatneft’s shareholding in Ukrtatnafta. The appeals and cassation that

followed this decision were not successful.

In deciding Case 17/178 the Economic Court of the Poltava Region enumerated the provisions
that had in its opinion been breached by Tatneft’s share purchases. These provisions include
those in the Ukrainian Constitution, the Civil Code, the Presidential Decree of 1994 on the

of L the 1995 ion of the CMU ing the Treaty
establishing Ukrtatnafta and the Treaty itself.“ The Tribunal can only note in disbelief that if in
fact all these violations had been committed no one, particularly no government service, had

ever raised questions before judicial proceedings were commenced a decade later.

The Tribunal cannot fail to notice that the sequence of court decisions concerning the question
of capital contributions led with each step to a situation more unfavourable to Tatneft. While
Case 32/1 in ordering to cancel Ukrtatnafta from the trade register and thereafter proceeding to
the liquidation of the Company would have undone the venture altogether, this order was the
only aspect of the judgment that was ultimately reversed on appeal, consequently allowing
Ukrtatnafta to survive. Case 17/178, in invalidating the share transfers that had allowed for
Tatnefi’s participation and ordering the return of such shares to Ukrtatnafta, dramatically
changed the shareholdings in the Company to the detriment of one party and the benefit of the

other. This, however, as it will be seen, would not be the last step in the sequence.

The Tribunal, while again not pretending to sit in review of the courts’ decisions, must reach its

own conclusions as to whether the modification of the capital contributions was illegal as this

aspect is of significant importance for the present dispute. The Parties do not dispute that the
capital contributions were changed in light of the General Shareholders Meetings resolutions
discussed. Cash was substituted for twenty-two oil fields and the supply of specific volumes of
oil. The justification for such modification, related to problems concerning costs and the
Tatarstan legislation in force at the time, does not appear to be quite convincing, at least in light
of the substitute value that was contributed, but it is also a fact that such reasons were never
questioned at the time and, on the contrary, the modifications were unanimously approved,

including with the concurring vote of the Ukrainian public officials noted.

Although the Tribunal can accept the Claimant’s argument to the effect that the specific
wording of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and Decree No. 704/94 of the President of Ukraine, like that
of other related enactments, is not entirely clear as to the scope of the obligations it sets in
connection with capital contributions, it is quite evident that the new scheme of capital
contributions was not that originally envisaged in the establishment of Ukrtatnafta. Neither are
these instruments entirely clear about which governmental bodies were entrusted with the

responsibility of authorizing amendments to Ukrtatnafta’s constituent documents.

Both the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and that of Tatarstan, as stated by the Court in Case
17/178, were indeed entrusted with the establishment of the Company. The Court concluded in
that case that any amendments to the constitutive instruments of Ukrtatnafta had also to be made
in accordance with the agreement of the authorities whose acts established the Company. While
approval of the constitutive instruments and decisions related thereto, like the initial capital
contributions and the transfers of State assets, were indeed assigned to the respective Council of
Ministers, the powers concerning corporate governance and administration did not necessarily
follow the same route as they belong to the normal functions of a joint-stock company under
their constituent documents.*® There was thus a dual authority governing the Company, one
under the aegis of political bodies and the other under the powers of the organs of the corporate

structure governing the Company.

The Court in Case 17/178 appears to have taken into consideration just the first kind of powers
but not the responsibility of the corporate organs in governing the Company. The Claimant
points out in this respect that under Article 16.2 of the 1995 Agreement on the establishment of
the Company it is the shareholders meetings that are empowered to modify and amend the
Agreement and the Charter, with the sole requirement being that this be done in writing and

signed by the authorized representatives of each Founder, a provision which also accords with

247.

the 1991 Law on Business Associations of Ukraine which entrusts the general meeting of
shareholders with modifications of the corporate charter.“ It is also argued in this respect that
neither the Ukrtatnafta Treaty nor the 1994 Presidential Decree contained any prohibition or

restriction of this power.

It has now to be determined whether the amendment of capital contributions pertains to the
powers of public bodies as held by the Court in Case 17/178, and hence can only be approved
by such bodies, or whether the amendment ought to be considered an aspect concerning the
powers of corporate governance and can thus be approved by the shareholders meetings as was
done in the instant case. The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that capital contributions, while at
their origins might be determined by the political bodies of the participating countries, in the
course of events that follow in the life of a company might be a matter for decision of the
corporate bodies, unless specific restrictions have been written in to this end. The Tribunal is
mindful that in its Partial Award on Jurisdiction it decided that the relations between Ukrtatnafta
and Tatneft were in the nature of business relations and this is the very rationale that determines
that the issue now under consideration has to be decided under the rules of corporate

governance.

The fact that Ukrtatnafta was established by Treaty and conceived at its origins as a single
interstate economic complex, as indicated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Tatarstan in its
Resolution No. 05-39/4101*"” and as the background of the creation of the Company clearly
shows, does not detract from the fact that its general shareholders meetings were entrusted with
the specific task of managing the company and this indeed includes the question of changes in
capital contributions. If a shareholders meeting decides, for example, to increase the
capitalization of the company to attain new corporate objectives this would fall squarely within
such organ’s powers. The amendments concerning capital contributions are not in essence
different, particularly if approved by the representatives of the founding members in the

shareholders meetings so deciding, as was very much the case here.

The Tribunal has carefully considered the Respondent’s views to the contrary but it is not
persuaded that they can justify a different conclusion in this aspect of the dispute. Whether the
Court’s interpretation in Case 17/178 is reasonably tenable as a matter of Ukrainian law might
be true, but this is only so if the amendments concern an aspect of the Treaty that evidently

pertains to the public aspects of the establishment of the Company, as would be the case, for

eae if the shareholders were to decide to invite a third State to participate in Ukrtatnafta.
: But it is not quite so if the amendments concern other kinds of powers. Without meaning any
criticism to the judgment in question, the conclusion that in the best of cases it is incomplete is
inescapable. In any event, the Tribunal needs to be mindful of the Claimant’s argument to the
effect that even if some acts might be in conformity with Ukrainian Law they cannot be invoked

in justification of a failure to perform the BIT as a matter of principle under international law.

Whether the Ukrainian government would not have signed the Treaty or the Incorporation
Agreement had it understood that capital contributions could be later amended is a matter of
speculation that cannot influence this Tribunal’s findings. The Tribunal does not disagree with
the view that Ukraine’s contribution of the Kremenchug refinery was conceived as the
counterpart of the Tatarstan’s contribution of the oil wells, but cannot ignore the fact that such
understanding changed in light of the concurrence of representatives of all founding members in
the shareholders meetings in approving the changes later perceived as necessary. Whether the
SPFU exceeded its powers in so approving, as also argued by the Respondent, does not change
this conclusion and it is a matter of internal responsibilities that cannot be imputed to the

detriment of the Claimant's rights under the BIT.

(d) Questions Concerning the Enactment of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty

250. The Tribunal must discuss at this point one important aspect on which the Parties have relied in
support of their respective arguments, namely the question of whether the Ukrtatnafta Treaty
was in force. As noted above the Claimant believes that the Treaty was not in force and thus
could not be the basis on which the courts grounded their conclusions to undo the share
arrangements agreed by the investors and the corporate bodies that intervened in these capital
restructurings." In the Claimant’s view, the “Treaty” was not an agreement between two States
and therefore it does not qualify as a proper treaty under international law, and in any event the
procedures provided under Article 13 of the Treaty for entry into force were not complied with
as there is no record of a notification by the Parties in compliance with their domestic
procedures, a situation which is also incompatible with the then applicable Ukrainian Law on

International Agreements.

ye
a

Had the Treaty been in force, the Claimant further maintains, the courts of Ukraine would have
lacked jurisdiction to deal with the disputes as they should have been submitted to the dispute

settlement procedures of Article 11 of the Treaty. Although the Treaty could have been de facto

254,

followed in some respects, for all legal and practical purposes it was the Incorporation
Agreement as amended that governed the powers and operations of Ukrtatnafta, with particular
reference to the question of capital contributions, which in the Claimant’s view would mean that

whether the Treaty was effective or not is immaterial.

It has also been explained above that in the Respondent’s view the Treaty duly came into force
as the Parties agreed on its immediate implementation thus making unnecessary any further
domestic proceedings. The fact that the Ukrainian Council of Ministers implemented the Treaty
is in itself, according to the Respondent, evidence that the Treaty was properly an
intergovernmental agreement and there is no reason to distinguish this type of treaty from other
categories which Ukrainian Law envisaged for domestic purposes that are of no relevance under
international law. The Tatarstan Republic at all times also considered the Treaty to be an

intergovernmental agreement.

As also explained above, the Respondent also asserts that at all times it has considered the
Treaty as a part of the domestic legal order and this would be the case even if the Treaty is not
considered to be effective under international law. Article 4 of the Law on Enterprises also
recognizes the prevalence of the provisions of international agreements over domestic law. A
similar understanding is explained in connection with the reference that Article 17 of the Law
on International Treaties makes to a different category of intergovernmental treaties as
constituting a part of the national legislation. This last law distinguishes between treaties subject
to ratification and others subject to approval; in practice most of Ukraine’s treaties do not follow

either of these alternatives and are considered in effect after they have been signed.

The Tribunal has no doubt about the fact that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty of 4 July 1995 was properly
a treaty under international law, as has convincingly been explained by the expert opinion of
Professor Buromenskiy. “? Mr. Toms? legal assessment of this question is wrong under
international law as the Respondent has pointed out." It is necessary to bear in mind in this
respect that under Article 2.1(a) of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties the
definition of a treaty is a broad one, being required that it be concluded between States in
written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in
two or more related instruments and “whatever its particular designation.” The Ukrtatnafta
Treaty was in fact concluded between States, Ukraine on the one hand and the Republic of

Tatarstan on the other, and the fact that the latter is a Republic of the Russian Federation in no

yy detracts from its governmental character, as frequently autonomous republics within a
federal State have the power to enter into treaties concerning their international relations in

interstate economic complex” governed by the Treaty, as noted in the letter of the Tatarstan
authorities to Ukraine of 3 August 2004,*” is the kind of competence that pertains to such

autonomous Republic.

255. Atno point was the issue that the Republic of Tatarstan might not have qualified as a State for

the purpose of the Treaty raised before this case was brought. The intergovernmental nature of
this Treaty is accordingly well established and it is properly included in the list of treaties
44

entered into by this Republic’ and, as the Respondent notes, no notice of termination has been

issued.‘

its Article 13 on the date of the last notice of compliance by the Parties with their respective
domestic procedures is an aspect that in essence depends on domestic law rather than
international law.*"* Each Party is free to follow its own domestic procedures and for that matter
its practice is particularly relevant in this connection.*"” The Claimant’s view to the effect that
Ukraine never gave notice of having complied with its procedures, just as it appears that
Tatarstan also did not do, does not affect the binding nature of the Treaty if the intention of the
Parties was so to be understood. The fact that the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine instructed a
Vice-Minister to sign the Treaty on behalf of the government and issued the corresponding
Resolution No. 487 of 4 July 1995 has been well established by Mr. Mityukov, the official
entrusted with this task.*"* More importantly, the government proceeded to implement the
Treaty and comply with its provisions, including the nomination of the Supervisory Board, thus

further evidencing the understanding that the Treaty was binding. The same holds true for the

Ukrtatnafta Charter and its Incorporation Agreement of 23 July 1995, both of which are again
founded on the Treaty.

The meaning of the Ukrainian domestic legislation on treaties thus has a limited role in the
context of this dispute, mainly related to the internal procedures to be followed in respect of
some categories of treaties. Article 2(3) of the Law on International Treaties appears to address
the question of executive agreements as it refers to international treaties on “economical, trade,
scientific, technical and other matters belonging to governmental competence.” which are to be
concluded on behalf of the Government and which according to Article 9 of this Law are
approved by way of a resolution, that is also a simplified procedure. Other kinds of treaties are
also distinguished by Article 17 of this Law when referring to the international agreements of
Ukraine that are concluded and properly ratified. As the Respondent has argued these
distinctions are of interest only for domestic purposes and do not affect the status of the
respective agreements under international law. In fact, while approval suffices for the first
category, more formal procedures of ratification are eventually necessary for the second type of
treaties. This situation is common to many countries and those procedures do not really change

the nature of the treaty concerned.

The practice in this respect is solely a domestic question. By its very nature the Ukrtatnafta
Treaty can well be considered an executive agreement establishing the “single interstate
economic complex” described above. It thus follows that the requirements for approval are
entirely a choice for domestic law and practice, which may even dispense with any particular
procedure as long as the intention to comply with the agreement is manifest, as is the case here.
Interestingly, the Respondent has explained that in the Ukrainian treaty practice at least 85% of

the treaties in effect are not ratified, many of which are not approved either.”

An issue related to the effectiveness of the Treaty is whether the Ukrainian courts would be
competent to deal with disputes under this instrument. As noted, the Claimant believes that if
the Treaty is in effect, only the dispute settlement procedures of its Article 11 should govern and
the Ukrainian courts would be incompetent in this respect. The Tribunal considers that there are
two sides to this question. The first is that concerning intergovernmental disputes which are
naturally governed by the Treaty. This also explains why finally this dispute has been brought
under the Russia-Ukraine BIT, again an intergovernmental treaty under which investors have

tights of action to protect their interests. The second side is that concerning the question of the

implementation of the provisions of the Treaty under domestic law, which is an aspect related to

the administration and operation of the company as a corporate entity.

In spite of the issues of dual authority that have been discussed in respect of corporate
governance, these properly belong to the implementation of the Treaty and disputes related
thereto are thus subject to domestic judicial intervention, provided the guarantees of protection
envisaged under the BIT are satisfied, which is the question that has been brought to this
Tribunal. In this respect, the finding of the Ukrainian courts to the effect that the Treaty is a part
of Ukrainian legislation is correct, as this will also be the normal consequence of an
international legal obligation, including the prevalence of these obligations over domestic rules
in case of contradiction, as Article 4 of the Law on Enterprises clearly establishes. Whether the
treaty in question is brought into effect by means of approval, ratification or otherwise, the

consequences in domestic legislation are the same.

The question the Tribunal must still answer is whether the fact that the Treaty is in effect
changes the Tribunal’s conclusions as to the meaning of the capital contributions originally
envisaged and the powers to have these contributions changed as per the decisions of the
company’s governing bodies, most notably through the General Shareholders Meeting. It has
been explained above that the amendments introduced to capital contributions, while different
from those originally envisaged, are of a kind pertaining to the administration of the company as
a commercial entity and do not fall under the elements of the public governance of Ukrtatnafta
as happens with other matters, such as would be the case explained of bringing in a State party
not counted among the original parties to the Treaty. It follows that those conclusions stand and
that accordingly the amendments introduced are not in breach of the Treaty or for that matter of
Ukrainian legislation in view of how the original capital contributions were neither entirely
clear nor understood to be permanent and not subject to amendment.” On this point the
Tribunal is also mindful of paragraph 188 of the Partial Award on Jurisdiction. In respect of this
conclusion, the Tribunal does not agree with those arrived at by the expert international law
report of Professor Buromenskiy, who believes that an amendment concerning the nature of

421 1%

contributions is contrary to the Treaty*”' unless approved at an interstate level

(e) ASystematic Adverse Line of Decisions and the Role of the Prosecutor
General

262. The performance of the Company following the changes in capital contributions does not appear
to have been affected by the amendments and would prove, as the Claimant argues in opposition
to the Respondent, that the objectives of the Company could be achieved all the same and that
the contribution of oil wells and equipment was not an essential condition for the creation of
Ukrtatnafta.

263. The Parties have argued about whether the systemic method of interpretation applied by the

courts, which the Respondent considers appropriate, or the literary and fragmentary reading of

 

the pertinent instruments, which it believes the Claimant to support, also justifies the
conclusions of those courts. The Tribunal is all in favor of a systemic method of interpretation
and it is precisely in this light that the aggregate of legal instruments relevant to this dispute
show that one thing was the original intent of the parties and quite another was how perceptions
changed in the course of events and materialized in agreements that responded to such

perceptions, again with the feature of having been unanimously approved.

264. It should be noted that arguments have also been made to the effect that the Courts’
interpretation of Article 8(3) of the Law “On Securities and Stock Exchange” is right or wrong.
The Claimant believes that this provision could only have been triggered if no contribution had
been made at all while the Respondent maintains that it was the change in the form of payment

that violated the Article in question and not the issue of whether a contribution was made or not.

265. The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that on many occasions national courts tend to take a
position on given points of fact and law that are the most favorable to the national interest
involved in a dispute. To the extent that this approach can be justified in light of its
compatibility with the ordinary meaning of governing provisions it might be considered tenable
and cannot be a point of criticism. When this exercise, however, results in systematic decisions
against the rights of the other party, and the latter’s arguments might be considered equally
tenable, there is reason to believe that the process might have run astray of due process and the

necessary impartiality in delivering justice.

266. The various cases that have been examined above show that the line of reasoning followed by
the courts was, save for occasional exceptions, systematically adverse to the rights of the
Claimant. The Tribunal has not ruled out that some aspects of those decisions might be tenable

in light of the facts or the applicable law, but it also believes that a number of the arguments of

PCA 118005 16

 

268.

269.

PCA 118005

the Claimant are also tenable and hence would have merited due consideration. This situation
calls into question the independence with which the courts proceeded in such cases and casts a
serious doubt about whether there was any intention to examine the rights claimed so as to

impartially rule on their eventual merit.

Had such decisions been the outcome of completely separate proceedings on issues of fact and
law one could readily admit that the claimants in such proceedings were simply wrong. But as
has been noted, almost every decision adopted resulted in a sequence that was with each step
more adverse to the Claimant and directly leading to findings that would in the end deprive it of
all rights in the Company. Furthermore, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that all such
proceedings were linked by a common thread that found its origins in the systematic role of the

Prosecutor in the unfolding of this dispute.

All the relevant cases were initiated by requests that the Prosecutor brought to the courts,
invariably seeking to reopen matters in respect of which limitation periods had long become
applicable. In the view of this Tribunal, the arguments in support of such requests were for the
most part unconvincing and on occasions contradicted by the Prosecutor’s own actions. Neither
can the Tribunal overlook the fact that such requests acquired momentum immediately
following the acquisition by Korsan of a 1% shareholding in the Company, a process which
ended in the prominent role that Korsan has today in its shareholding composition. As in many
countries, the Prosecutor performs an influential State service and has strong influence in the

administration of justice.

ANNULMENT OF SHAREHOLDINGS IN AMRUZ AND SEAGROUP
1. Court Decisions on the Shareholdings of AmRuz and Seagroup’”

The proceedings relevant to this dispute did not end with the decisions concerning Tatneft and
followed earlier cases, and also were accompanied by later cases concerning the shareholdings
of AmRuz and Seagroup in Ukrtatnafta. The facts relating to this other aspect of the dispute will

be examined next.

(a) Undisputed Facts

In August 2001, the SPFU filed a lawsuit against Ukrtatnafta and all of its shareholders before

the Kyiv Economic Court to set aside the share purchase agreements entered into by each of

Second Counter-Memorial, Jf 198-199.

AmRuz and Seagroup with Ukrtatnafta on the basis that the contracts violated the legal ~
requirement that the shares of the founding shareholders be paid for within one year and that
Ukrainian law barred the use of promissory notes to pay for these shares, in what were to
become Cases 28/198 and 28/199, respectively." Tatneft entered the case as a third party in

opposition to the claims,**

271. The Kyiv Economic Court upheld the SPFU’s claims for both cases on 28 November 2001.*”°
The Court found that the use of promissory notes to purchase shares violated Article 13 of the

°7 which excluded promissory notes from the kinds of assets that could be used

Company Law,
to contribute to the charter capital of a company.” It also found that the addenda to the share
purchase agreements that were entered into between Ukrtatnafta and AmRuz and Seagroup,
respectively, had the effect of extending the deadline for AmRuz and Seagroup to make their
capital contributions to Ukrtatnafta beyond that imposed by Articles 11 and 33 of the Company
Law, as well as Ukrtatnafta’s Incorporation Agreement and Charter.*” The Court therefore
nullified the share purchase agreements entered into with AmRuz and Seagroup, respectively,
and ordered that AmRuz and Seagroup return their shares to Ukrtatnafta.® The Kyiv Economic
Court of Appeal affirmed this judgment on 14 March 2002.**"

272. On29 May 2002, the Higher Economic Court reversed the judgments of 28 November 2001."
It found that, when AmRuz and Seagroup entered into their respective share purchase
agreements, Ukrainian law did not forbid the use of promissory notes to purchase company
shares because Article 13 of the Company Law authorized the use of securities to contribute to
the share capital of a company, and Article 3 of the Securities and Stock Exchange Law defined
securities to include “notes.”** It also held that the addenda to the share purchase agreements

did not violate Article 33 of the Company Law or Ukrtatnafta’s Incorporation Agreement or

er because the obligation of AmRuz and Seagroup to make their capital contribution to

atnafta was satisfied as soon as they transferred the promissory notes.“*

‘The Supreme Court of Ukraine dismissed the cassation appeals filed by the SPFU on 18 July
435

2002 and 1 November 2002, respectively.
At around this time, on 16 September 2002, the Prosecutor filed a lawsuit—in what was to
become Case 8/604—before the Poltava Region Economic Court against AmRuz, Seagroup,
Ukrtatnafta, and other Ukriatnafta shareholders to set aside Article 5(5) of the Ukrtatnafta
Incorporation Agreement, insofar as it authorized the use of “securities,” including promissory

notes, as payment for Ukrtatnafia shares on the basis that this was contrary to Ukrainian law.96

+ Prosecutor alleged that the use of promissory notes by AmRuz and Seagroup to pay for their
p shares violated Article 31 of the Company Law, which stated that the shareholders should pay at
least 50% of the nominal value of the share capital before the first shareholders’ general
meeting. *” On 19 December 2002, the Poltava Region Economic Court dismissed the
Prosecutor’s claim.*** Acknowledging the dismissal of the Higher Economic Court of Cases
28/198 and 28/199, it upheld the lawfulness of using promissory notes to purchase Ukrtatnafta
shares, **° thereby concluding that Article 5(5) of the Incorporation Agreement complied with

Ukrainian law.°

275. In November 2004, Naftogaz, which is the state-owned energy company of Ukraine, filed a
lawsuit against AmRuz, Seagroup, and Ukrtatnafta shareholders—in what was to become Case
15/559—to set aside Article 5(3) of the Incorporation Agreement, on the basis that this
provision violated Articles 13 and 31 of the Company Law, because promissory notes were not
“securities” within the meaning of Article 13, and both AmRuz and Seagroup did not make their
contributions within the statutory period owing to the extension of the maturity date of the

promissory. notes.“*? On 10 January 2005, the Kyiv Economic Court upheld the use of

once they had transferred the notes; and thereby rejected Naftogaz’s argument that AmRuz and
Seagroup had failed to pay half of their contribution before the first general shareholders?
meeting.“ On 1 April 2005, the Kyiv Economic Court dismissed the appeal of Naftogaz
against this decision.’ On 6 September 2005, the Higher Economic Court, in considering the
cassation appeal lodged by Naftogaz, rejected all but one of the grounds for appeal raised by
Naftogaz,"" a decision which was later set aside by the Supreme Court of Ukraine on 18 April

2006, in response to a cassation appeal filed by AmRuz and Seagroup.‘**

On 24 January 2008, the Prosecutor lodged an extraordinary cassation appeal with the Supreme
Court of Ukraine to set aside the 29 May 2002 decisions of the Higher Economic Court and
reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199“"°—citing to Article 111(15) of the Code of Commercial
Procedure then in force, which authorized the reopening of a case decided by the Higher
Economic Court if that court had applied the same legal provision differently in similar cases”
—on the basis of Case 45/383 Northland Power Darnytia Inc. v. Ukrnaftogaz OJSC
(“Northland Power”) dated 14 November 2006.“ Because Article 111(16) of the Code of
Commercial Procedure required the cassation appeal to be filed within a month from the

relevant decision, the Prosecutor invoked Article 53 of the Code of Commercial Procedure,
aAA9

which allowed the filing of this cassation appeal beyond one month for “justifiable reasons.

On 21 February 2008, the Supreme Court of Ukraine, citing Article 111(15) of the Code of

Commercial Procedure, accepted the extraordinary cassation appeal filed by the

the relevant courts set aside the 2002 judgments of the Higher Economic Court as well as i
: the other judgments rendered in Cases 28/198 and 28/199.

‘On 28 May 2008 for Case 28/198 and 2 June 2008 for Case 28/199, the Kyiv Economic Court,

before which the aforementioned cases were retried, invalidated the share purchase agreements ‘ ;
entered into between Ukrtatnafta and AmRuz and Seagroup, respectively, and ordered AmRuz
and Seagroup to return their shares to Ukrtatnafta.** In doing so, the Court held that AmRuz
and Seagroup violated Article 8(3) of the Securities Law because they received their shares on
8 June 1999 in exchange for 65 promissory notes, of which only three were redeemed.** The
Court also held that AmRuz and Seagroup had breached Article 33 of the Law of Ukraine on
Business Associations, which required shareholders to pay the full price of shares no later than
one year after the registration of a joint stock company.*** Lastly, the Court referred to the
Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 528, dated 10 September 1992 and
entitled “Rules of Issue and Use of Promissory Note Forms” (“Resolution 528”), which allows
promissory notes to be issued only for the payment of “delivered products, executed works and

rendered services.”**”

Higher Economic Court dismissed the Claimant’s and Naftogaz’s cassation appeal against the

decision of the lower court,*°" and on 4 February 2010, the Supreme Court dismissed the

Claimant’s and Naftogaz’s cassation appeal against the decision rendered by the Higher

Economic Court.“

(b) Disputed Facts
i. The Parity Requirement of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty

As a preliminary matter, the Claimant alleges that the parity requirement imposed by the
Ukrtatnafta Treaty did not prevent AmRuz and Seagroup from acquiring Ukrtatnafta shares.
This principle was, in the Claimant’s view, not intended to extend beyond the incorporation of
Ukttatnafta." Hence, the purchase of Ukrtatnafta shares at a later point in time by AmRuz and
Seagroup—both of whom were incorporated neither in Ukraine nor in Tatarstan—could not
have breached this requirement. *”

For its part, the Respondent argues that the acquisition of AmRuz and Seagroup of Ukrtatnafta
shares, which gave them an 18% collective interest in Ukrtatnafta, in addition to what it
characterizes as their almost instant alliance with the Tatarstan shareholders, was a substantial

breach of the parity principle, which was a fundamental basis of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty.**

ii. | The Non-Application of the Statute of Limitations in, and the Merits of,
Cases 28/198 and 28/199

The Claimant's Position

283.

In filing his application to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199 six years after the adjudication of
these cases and fourteen months after the allegedly inconsistent decision in Northland Power,
the Prosecutor, according to the Claimant, made only a conclusory and unsubstantiated assertion

that he was unaware of both the Higher Economic Court judgments and the Northland Power

469 hich the Claimant states was a lie because the Prosecutor would have learned of Cases
>

198 and 28/199 as early as in 2002 through Case 8/604, which he had initiated to set aside

| AmRuz’s and Seagroup’s purchases of Ukriatnafta shares, as these cases were relied on as

precedent by the court in Case 8/604.'” Similarly, the Prosecutor allegedly became aware of the
Northland Power case by participating in Case 17/34 State Property Fund of Ukraine v. CJSC
Energy Generating Company Ukr-Can Power” (Kyiv) and others, which was litigated in parallel
and, according to the Claimant, was strictly intertwined with the Northland Power case."” The
Claimant also adds that the Northland Power case was one of the most prominent cases in

Ukraine at that time attracting wide coverage by the local press.*”

. Turning to the Supreme Court proceedings resulting in the de novo review of Cases 28/198 and
28/199, the Claimant contends that these proceedings involved serious due process violations
for three reasons. First, the Supreme Court proceedings were held ex parte and in camera."
According to the Claimant, AmRuz and Seagroup had not been notified of the Prosecutor’s
request to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199 prior to the Supreme Court’s acceptance of the
request on 21 February 2008.'" Hence, the Respondent acted inconsistently with the provisions
of the 1965 Hague Convention on Service Abroad.*” Second, even if AmRuz and Seagroup had
been notified of the Prosecutor’s request, such notice would not be determinative in the present
case since the Supreme Court did not allow AmRuz and Seagroup to submit any objections to
the admissibility of the Prosecutor’s request.‘”° Third, when AmRuz and Seagroup were made
aware of the Supreme Court’s decision to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199, which occurred
after its issuance, they had no opportunity to challenge the decision, which was not subject to

appeal.’””

From the foregoing, the Claimant concludes that the Supreme Court’s decision to grant the
Prosecutor’s manifestly time-barred request to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199 without
providing AmRuz and Seagroup an opportunity to be heard and to challenge the decision
resulted in serious breaches of due process and the principle of res judicata.'*

The Claimant adds that the Supreme Court wrongly exercised its discretion to extend the
statutory deadline in this case, as it did not meet the requirements that it base its decision on
evidence of “material reasons” for the missed deadlines; account for the circumstances behind
the failure to meet the deadline; and express the “material reasons” for a failure to act within the

time period ina substantiated opinion.*”

The Claimant maintains that, if the unilateral assertion of ignorance (without more) sufficed to

reopen final court decisions many years after they had been adjudicated, the res judicata effect
40

 

of court decisions and the finality of judgments would be eviscerate

‘The Claimant contends that the decisions to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199 lacked a colorable
basis under Ukrainian law."*! Although Article 111(15)-3 of the Ukrainian Code of Commercial
Procedure then in force empowered the Supreme Court of Ukraine to reconsider judgments of
the Higher Economic Court if the latter court had applied the same legal provision similarly in
different cases,"** Cases 28/198 and 28/ 199, on the one hand, and Northland Power, on the
other, could not have been inconsistent, because the latter was a case in which no contribution
had been made for the cancelled shares*® and in which the lawfulness of promissory notes as a
means of purchasing shares was not considered.’**

The Claimant notes that, in any event, if the decisions to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199 were
warranted under Ukrainian law, which it denies, it would mean that Ukrainian law would allow

for the reopening of court decisions any time after they had become final on the basis of a mere

the Claimant’s view, the key requirement under Ukrainian law for reopening proceedings—

"the inconsistency of two or several court decisions—was not satisfied in this case. Specifically,

the Claimant states that the courts in Cases 28/198 and 28/199, collectively, and Northland
Power were not inconsistent in their application of Article 8(3) of the Securities Law and
Article 33 of the Company Law because the courts in the former cases did not consider
Article 8(3), having found that promissory notes could be used to pay for shares, and merely
cited Article 33, as was also the case for the Northland Power decision.**’ The Claimant further
alleges that these decisions are highly questionable, given that the Ukrainian courts had
previously stated that the use of promissory notes to pay for shares was permitted under

Ukrainian law.‘

. The Claimant’s expert confirms that, under Article 48(2) of the Ukrainian SSR Civil Code, the

Ukrainian courts were obliged to grant restitution to AmRuz and Seagroup after invalidating
their share acquisition.” However, the Kyiv Court of Appeal, while upholding the decision of
the Kyiv Economic Court, did not order the return to AmRuz and Seagroup of the promissory
notes that they had issued or the amounts that they had paid under the notes.”

The Claimant’s expert admits that AmRuz and Seagroup were theoretically entitled to file a
counterclaim for the return of their property or for a grant of compensation under Ukrainian
law. 7" However, as a matter of practice, one would never file such a counterclaim since
Ukrainian courts would consider it to be a concession.” In the expert’s opinion, the decision in
the Dekon case corroborated its position that AmRuz and Seagroup should not have had to file a

separate action for the return of their property."

The Respondent first points out that the SPFU prevailed in its claims against AmRuz and

Seagroup in six out of the seven courts that reviewed this case on the merits,"

and that the only
court that took the position of the Claimant was the Higher Economic Court, which the

Respondent contends was mistaken in doing so.""°

The Respondent stresses that the Ukrainian President immediately ordered an investigation
when he received a note on 2 July 2001 that advised him that AmRuz and Seagroup had
obtained an 18% share of Ukrtatnafta in exchange for mostly promissory notes.””* It also states
that Tatneft had initially expressed concerns about the unpaid shares of AmRuz and Seagroup,

only to reverse its position later on*” for its own self-interest."

As a general matter, the Respondent notes that “it is staggering to consider the degree of
corruption that would have had to have been perpetrated in this case at all levels of the judiciary,
right up to the Ukrainian Supreme Court” in order to support the Claimant’s primary line of
argument that the loss of shares of AmRuz and Seagroup resulted from corrupt legal

proceedings.*”

The Respondent notes that the Prosecutor had moved to reopen the 2002 decisions of the Higher
Economic Court on the shareholdings of AmRUZ and Seagroup once it learned of the later
decision of the same court in Northland Power Daryntsia.*® It rejects the Claimant’s argument
that the Prosecutor had acted wrongfully in filing the petition to reopen Cases 28/198 and
28/199. It states that the application to reopen the cases was based on the Northland Power
decision, which rendered any prior knowledge by the Prosecutor’s office of Cases 28/198 and
28/199 immaterial.*”' It also points out that the Prosecutor could not have been made aware of
the Northland Power decision by its participation in the related Case 17/34 because this case

502

predated Northland Power by four months”*’ and characterizes the argument that the Prosecutor

would have been monitoring this case for fear of an appeal of Case 17/34 to the Supreme Court
ff ‘as weak.*”? The Respondent explains that mere knowledge of Northland Power Daryntsia was
ti insufficient to enable the Prosecutor to file an appeal and notes that the Prosecutor had to know,
specifically, that this case and Cases 28/198 and 28/199 had relied on Article 33 of the Business

Entities Law."

The Respondent lastly notes that there has been no evidence that the Prosecutor’s application
and its acceptance by the Supreme Court was a pretext to benefit the raiders.°° The Respondent
also points out that neither AmRuz nor Seagroup contradicted (whether by evidence or
pleading) the Prosecutor’s explanation of how he had learned of the Northland Power case.°
Moreover, the explanation provided by the Prosecutor to support his application to renew the
cassation term was typically accepted by courts in like matters.°"’ The Respondent further
rejects the Claimant’s argument, made during the hearing, that the Prosecutor would have
known about the Northland Power case merely because this case was famous, and reiterates that

the factual record is silent on this matter.*

298. The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s characterization of the Supreme Court decision on the
cassation renewal as ex parte and in camera. First, the Respondent states that the decision was
not rendered ex parte because the Prosecutor notified AmRuz and Seagroup of the cassation
appeal, and both AmRuz and Seagroup could have made submissions on this proceeding, but
did not.°” In fact, the Respondent points out that there is no evidence that either AmRuz or
Seagroup had raised the objection that they had not been notified of the proceeding, and notes

that the Claimant itself had not made this argument before the present proceedings.*””

299. The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument (which it characterizes as “belated”) that the
Prosecutor’s notice to AmRuz and Seagroup did not comply with the requirements of the 1965

Hague Convention on Service Abroad and argue that there is no evidence showing that AmRuz

and Seagroup had alleged a Hague Convention violation when they appeared before the

Supreme Court or that this Convention even applies to the matter at hand.*""

300. Second, the Respondent argues that the Supreme Court decision was not made in camera
because decisions to grant cassation review are made at a conference of judges, based only on

written submissions. *””

Moreover, the consistent practice of the Supreme Court was not to
provide reasons for its procedural decisions, as a result of which its decisions on the cassation
appeal could not be considered “extraordinary” or “unjustified” just because they were

unsubstantiated.*

301.

Maintaining that the Supreme Court had a material reason to extend the limitation period to

 

enable the Prosecutor to apply for the reopening of Cases 28/198 and 28/199, the Respondent
first clarifies that the test at the time of the Supreme Court’s decision to reopen Cases 28/198
and 28/199 was whether similar laws had been applied differently in the two cases at hand.>" It
then rejects the Claimant’s allegation that the Northland Power case was not sufficiently similar
to Cases 28/198 and 28/199 so as to give rise to any inconsistency.*’* It states that at their core,
Cases 28/198 and 28/199—as well as Northland Power—concerned the feilure of the parties to
pay for their shares.*° The Respondent specifically alleges that AmRuz and Seagroup not only
tendered promissory notes instead of paying for their shares, but further failed to pay the
amounts owed under the promissory notes. *!” It further states that the ultimate outcome of both
Cases 28/198 and 28/199 turned on the same legal provisions that were the subject of the court’s
decision in Northland Power, namely Article 8(3) of the Securities Law and Article 33 of the
Business Associations Law." It concludes by stating that “the decisions of both courts were
consistent with the decisions in Northland Power and were entirely in accordance with

Ukrainian law.”°?

e Respondent further points out that neither AmRuz nor Seagroup requested that the Kyiv
urt of Appeal order the return of the promissory notes or the amounts paid under them,*”° and

“argues that the Court was therefore under no obligation to award them the said restitution. As
: in the context of its discussion of Cases 32/1 and 17/178 (discussed above), the Respondent

rejects the Claimant’s expert’s reliance on the Dekon case as controlling authority for the
proposition that courts should grant restitution even absent a request from the defendant that it
do so, by explaining that Dekon contradicted the general trend of court decisions including a
2005 Supreme Court decision;*” that the Claimant’s expert was only made aware of this case
by the reference of the Respondent’s expert to it;”? and that the Ukrainian system does not

recognize precedent in court cases.***

Claimant.” It contends that this court decision affected the right of the Claimant to participate

was vested in the Supervisory Board and was subject to the approval of the General
Shareholders Meeting and that the Claimant and the other shareholders had the right to establish
the timing and modalities of the sale of the AmRuz and Seagroup shares.*””

The Respondent's Position

305. The Respondent states that Ukrainian law does not require the Economic Court of the Poltava
Region to notify the Claimant of the existence of the proceedings in Case 17/60, as the
Economic Procedure Code only required the Court to notify the actual parties, meaning AmRuz
and Seagroup, of the existence of the proceedings. While Articles 111-103(3) of the Economic
Procedure Code provides that a court decision may be quashed on cassation if it “concerns” the
rights and obligations of a non-party, the application of this provision is a matter of judicial

discretion.°*

 

a The Tribunal’s Consideration of the Facts Concerning the Shareholdings of AmRuz,
and Seagroup

306. In the view of the Ukrainian Ministry of Fuel and Energy, the two ‘new shareholders were
admitted as the need to attract new capital arose in connection with the purchase of oil that
could no longer be available as a consequence of the change in the capital contribution of oil
wells by Tatarstan. Although these other companies are not a party to the dispute before this
Tribunal they have the working arrangements with Tatneft that have been described. Whether
such arrangements have or have not an influence on the Claimant’s rights is a matter to be
considered further below. But what is of importance at this stage of the analysis of the Tribunal
is that such other proceedings, namely Cases 28/198 and 28/199, appear to have followed the

same pattern considered above.

307. On the ground that the use of promissory notes that intervened in the capital contributions of
AmRuz and Seagroup had violated Article 13 of the Company Law, the lawsuits filed by the
SPFU against Uk and all its seeking invalidation of such

 

were upheld by the Kyiv Economic Court on 28 November 2001. In the Court’s view, that
provision excluded promissory notes from the kinds of assets that at the time could be used to
contribute to the capital of a company and limited promissory notes to being used for payment
for “delivered products, performed operations or rendered services.” The outcome of these
decisions was that the Court annulled the share purchase agreements entered into with AmRuz
and Seagroup, respectively, and ordered that AmRuz and Seagroup return their shares to

Ukrtatnafta.

period for the payment of the promissory notes agreed to had breached Articles 11 and 33
f the Company Law and the Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement and Charter, with the

decisions in question so ruling.

Although these decisions were affirmed by the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal on 14 March
2002, they were ultimately reversed by the Higher Economic Court on 29 May 2002 on the
ground that Articles 3 and 21 of the Law on Securities and Stock Exchange in conjunction with
Article 13 of the Law on Business Companies considered promissory notes a security that can
be contributed to the capital of a company. The Supreme Court in a series of decisions adopted
in 2002 and 2006 upheld the validity of the use of promissory notes and the extension of the
payment period as being compatible with the legislation in effect at the time and Article 5.3 of
the Incorporation Agreement. The provisions of the Articles of the Company Law noted were
thus held to have been satisfied as in force at the time of the transactions considered in these

cases.

Although the Respondent believes that the decisions of the Higher Economic Court on the
acceptance of the promissory notes issued in payment of the capital contributions of AmRuz
and Seagroup, and ultimately their confirmation by the Supreme Court, are legally incorrect,°°°
the interpretation of Ukrainian law on which they are based is tenable and cannot be disqualified
because of being different from the interpretation advanced by other courts that intervened in
this matter. That delivery of promissory notes constituted “payment” for the purposes of
Ukrainian law was a tenable conclusion, just like the extension in the date for payment is. To
take into account the law as it stood at the time, in view of amendments barring the use of
promissory notes for founders’ capital contributions becoming effective later, is also tenable in

spite of the Respondent’s belief to the contrary."

The fact that there were six out of seven Ukrainian courts at four judicial levels, with 21 out of
24 reviewing judges, that ruled against the use of promissory notes, which the Respondent
invokes in support of its argument,** does not niean that only one interpretation could be
regarded as tenable, or that jurisprudence can be established by majority counting. The same
holds true for the fact that all decisions that followed the Supreme Court’s reopening of Cases

28/198 and 28/199 were similarly adverse to the companies concerned.

The decisions of the Higher Economic Court and the Supreme Court noted stand in contrast to
the line of the Tatneft cases considered above and show that, at least with regard to the issue of
promissory notes, there were tenable arguments on the side of the affected companies. This
development, however, in spite of having provided the basis for a stable legal conclusion on the

payment of capital contributions by means of promissory notes, was to be short-lived.

Indeed, in 2002 the Prosecutor had initiated proceedings against AmRuz, Seagroup, Ukrtatnafta
and other shareholders that led to Case 8/604 before the Poltava Region Economic Court,
asserting that Article 5(5) of the Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement authorizing the use of
securities, on the basis of which the promissory notes were issued, was contrary to Ukrainian
law because the use of promissory notes merely contributed debt obligations and did not comply
with the requirement of Article 31 of the Company Law insofar as it could not satisfy the
obligation to pay at least 50% of the capital before the first General Shareholders Meeting. The
Poltava Region Economic Court dismissed this claim relying on the prior decisions of the
Higher Economic Court in Cases 28/198 and 28/199 noted above upholding the lawfulness of
promissory notes to effect such capital contributions. Shortly afterwards, in 2004, Naftogaz filed
new lawsuits based on the argument that promissory notes were not “securities” within the
meaning of Article 13 of the Company Law, and also asserting that the extension of the
payment date agreed to was contrary to Article 31 of this law. This other claim was also
dismissed on appeal by the Kyiv Economic Court and, with the exception of one ground, by the

Higher Economic Court.

The Prosecutor, however, years later, in 2008, filed a Cassation Appeal against the decisions of
the Higher Economic Court in respect of Cases 28/198 and 28/199, seeking to reopen such cases
in spite of the lapsed appeal time period, on the ground that the Higher Economic Court had
applied the same legal provision in a different manner in Case 45/383, the Northland Power
case of 2006. The Prosecutor asserted in particular that it had not participated in this case and
was therefore unaware of the different interpretations made, a view which the Claimant believes
is untrue in light of the various judicial proceedings in which this official had participated and
which interlinked the various issues involved, including the Northland Power case.* The
Supreme Court then reversed its earlier understanding and ruled that contributing debt
obligations was contrary to Article 13 of the Companies Law. It also decided that there were

justifiable grounds for commencing cassation proceedings in spite of the missed cassation

period, and remanded the cases concerned for de novo review. The judgments of the

igher Economic Court and other courts in these cases were set aside.

The Respondent sees no contradiction in these Supreme Court decisions based on the

be considered at the stage of the cassation appeal, opposing on this point’ the views of
Mr. Toms.*2* The scope of the decisions in question might be different but the fact that stands is
that the whole issue was reopened and finally led to conclusions exactly contrary to those

reached earlier.

. The Parties have disputed whether the Cassation Appeal was duly notified to AmRuz and
a particularly i due process i as the appeal would be decided

within one month as mandated by the Ukraine Code of Economic Procedure. In spite of the fact
that procedural negligence on the part of these companies is invoked by the Respondent as the
Ke basis for having failed to oppose that application before the Supreme Court and resulting in an
ex parte decision,*® there is no appropriate evidence that such application was properly served

and just sending a copy of the cassation appeal is not the same as having duly serviced a proper
notice, particularly if in the Claimant’s view the ensuing decision was not later subject to
appeal.*** Although the Claimant invoked at the hearing the service requirements of the Hague
Convention on Service Abroad this argument was not invoked before the courts nor well

explained®*” and will thus not be further discussed.

317. As a result of these new developments the share purchase agreements entered into between
Ukrtatnafta and AmRuz and Seagroup, respectively, were invalidated in 2008 and AmRuz and
Seagroup were ordered to return their shares to Ukrtatnafta. It was held that Article 8(3) of the
Securities Law had been breached because shares had been exchanged for sixty-five promissory
notes of which only three had been redeemed. Article 33 of the Ukraine Law on Business
Associations had also been breached because the shares had not been paid in full at least one
year before the registration of the joint stock company. Such exchange was also held
incompatible with the 1992 Resolution of the Cabinet Ministers of Ukraine on the use of

promissory notes allowing their issuance for delivered products, executed works and rendered

services. All these decisions were affirmed by the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal, the Higher -

Economic Court and the Supreme Court in the proceedings that followed.

Not long afterwards, also in 2008, Korsan began proceedings in Case 17/60 against Ukrtatnafta
and several of its officials seeking to compel the sale of shares formerly held by AmRuz and

Seagroup, a request which was granted in 2009 without informing the defendants.

The Parties have argued about whether the share purchases of AmRuz and Seagroup were
contrary to the parity principle of the Ukctatnafta Treaty, and in particular about whether the
parity requirement was permanent or not intended to extend beyond the incorporation of
Ukttatnafta. The Tribunal has already discussed above that the question of the form of capital
contributions does not relate to the public nature of the Treaty but rather to the governance of
Ukctatnafia. The situation here is not different. There is no reason to believe that the parity
requirement was meant to be permanent as the governance of the company would have been
placed in a straitjacket if that were the case. In the Tribunal’s Partial Award on Jurisdiction it
was already established that parity had to be understood in a framework of flexibility. Reasons
of legal interpretation aside, including the powers given to the company’s governing bodies by
the Incorporation Agreement, the situation that followed these developments confirms that
parity was not an essential element of the future structure of the company. In fact it will be
explained further below that following the invalidation of Tatneft shares and the sale of those
held by AmRuz and Seagroup, all shares are today in the hands of Ukrainian interests, public

and private. The parity principle simply does not exist today.

The Tribunal is not convinced either by the Prosecutor’s assertion that because of being
allegedly unaware of Cases 28/198 and 28/199 and the Northland Power decision there was
cause to reopen the cases in question. The evidence introduced by the Claimant shows that in
fact the Prosecutor had been a party to cases where the same cases and the Northland Power
decision had been specifically discussed, notably Case 8/604 before the Economic Court of the
Poltava Region and Case 17/34 in the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal. The Prosecutor’s
statements before the Supreme Court to the effect that he had only learnt of the events
concerning Cases 28/198 and 28/199 when Ukrtatnafta had filed its claims before the courts and

not earlier is therefore questionable,””* as is the view that such official had not been aware of

32/1 as it had been invoked in its own application in Case 8/604.** Although differences
dates have been noted by the Respondent to argue that Northland Power had been issued four
months later than the decision in Case 17/34 and hence could not be in the knowledge of the
Prosecutor, “° this does not mean that the Prosecutor was unaware of what was being discussed

jin that other case as the Claimant believes.*""

The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that Article 111(15) of the Ukrainian Code of Economic
Procedure provides as a ground for the Supreme Court’s reopening a resolution of the Higher
Commercial Court that of when the latter has applied the same provision differently in similar
cases. Again here the Parties hold different views. While the Respondent believes that the cases
concerning AmRuz and Seagroup dealt with the same issue as Northland Power, namely the
non-payment of capital contributions in light of Article 8(3) of the Securities Law and Article
33 of the Business Associations Law and thus that the cases were similar and justified their
reopening by the Supreme Court, the Claimant is of the view that the cases were not similar as
Northland Power was a case in which no contribution had been made for the cancelled shares
and in which the lawfulness of promissory notes as a means of purchasing shares was not

considered.

When a court finds in one case that promissory notes could not be used for payment of capital
contributions and in another that no capital contributions had been made at all, it is difficult to
consider these cases as being similar, particularly in light of the earlier Supreme Court

that d had di their obligati equity
contributions by providing the company with the promissory notes in question. If such payment
is considered valid it cannot indeed be compared to a situation in which no payment exists.
Furthermore, the Tribunal notes the Claimant’s argument to the effect that the Cabinet Ministers
of Ukraine in an application for review of the decisions in Cases 28/198 and 28/199 recognized
as recently as 2010 the validity of AmRuz’s and Seagroup’s share purchases on the ground that

they were in accordance with the Ukrainian law in force in 1999.

The Tribunal considers that the Respondent’s argument to the effect that at the time of the

Supreme Court’s reopening of the cases there was a practice nof to give reasons in justification

of such outcome,*”

and thus that unsubstantiated decisions could not be considered unjustified,
is not likely to convince this Tribunal. Neither does the Tribunal find any more convincing the
argument that a typical reason for reopening cases is the non-participation of the Prosecutor in
the original litigation.’ The Claimant correctly points out that under Ukrainian law, as
provided under Articles 71, 76 and 80 of the Civil Code and Articles 111-16 and 53 of the Code
of Economic Procedure, the extension of statutory deadlines requires evidence of “material
reasons” that would so justify an extension,*“* a standard that cannot be met by unsubstantiated
opinions, particularly when the cases involved entail important economic consequences for the

defendants and a serious legal issue concerning the question of res judicata of judicial

 

decisions. The Tribunal further notes that the Ukrainian law experts whose reports were
produced in the instant case by both Parties are in agreement about such strict requirements for

the courts to renew a limitation period, as the Claimant has maintained.*#*

Neither can the Tribunal find convincing the Respondent’s view to the effect that there is a
distinction to be made in respect of cases where the Prosecutor acts on behalf of another entity,
in which it would be the date the Prosecutor learnt of the relevant violation, and not the date in

which the entity so learnt, that would trigger the operation of the Statute of Limitation.*"

The Tribunal must thus conclude that the extension of a specific statutory deadline does not
appear to be justified in this context. Neither is the fact that notifications were omitted in
Case 17/60 in respect of Tatneft helpful to support the Respondent’s arguments in respect of
compliance with due process of law. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent’s views to the
effect that not every allegation of due process violations can result in the breach of the fair and
equitable treatment,” as will be discussed further below, but in this case the questionable role
of the Prosecutor that has been noted applies in similar terms to this other series of lawsuits

directed to reopening past cases and it thus becomes not an isolated event.

.LLEGED DEBT FOR PAST OIL DELIVERIES

Claimant has also brought a claim for the question of alleged debt for past oil purchases.

ile intertwined with the claims examined above, this claim will be examined by the Tribunal

further below.
TATNEFT’S CLAIMS UNDER THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE BIT
THE APPROACHES TO TREATY BREACHES CONTENDED BY THE PARTIES

. The first question the Tribunal has to examine in connection with the claims for liability is
whether it is appropriate to follow a systemic approach calling for the assessment of the
Respondent’s conduct as a whole, which is the position taken by the Claimant, or an approach
calling for the examination of the facts individually, which is the position favored by the

Respondent.

328. The Claimant relies in support of its position on Rosinvest ({ 410), Vivendi IZ (§ 7.5.31) and
Walter Bau (§ 12.43), cases which have underlined the need to consider acts and omissions in a
cumulative manner and not as isolated events incapable on their own of establishing liability. In
the Claimant’s view, the cumulative acts to be assessed belong to four main categories, all of
which have been factually examined above: the seizure of the Kremenchug refinery and the

change in Uk ’s the of Tatarstan’s title to shares in
the Company (Cases 32/1 and 17/178); the annulment of AmRuz’s and Seagroup’s title to

shares (Cases 28/198 and 28/199); and the annulment of Tatneft’s title to shares (Case 17/178).

329. The Claimant maintains that most of the investor’s rights protected under the Russia-Ukraine
BIT and its interrelations with other treaties have been breached, with particular reference to the
standards for fair and equitable treatment, complete and unconditional legal protection, full
protection and security, effective means for assertion of claims and enforcement of rights, and

expropriation. These claims will be examined below.

330. In considering the facts of this case the Tribunal has noted that there is a clear link between
these series of events and that they all culminated in the taking over of Ukrtatnafta by
Ukrainian-related interests to the exclusion of the Tatarstan interests. These developments took
place step by step with each aggravating the situation of the Claimant. It would be an artificial
proposition to try to assess these events in an isolated manner, particularly in view of the fact

that the shareholding in Ukrtatnafta changed dramatically during the intervening period. Indeed,
Tatnefi’s, AmRuz’s and Seagroup’s interests disappeared altogether with only Naftogaz’s
shareholding remaining untouched; the SPFU shares were also diminished and Korsan’s interest

increased from 1% to 47.08%, a process that appears not to have ended.

As a point of fact, during his testimony at the oral hearing Mr. Kolomoisky explained that the
original plans to create a vertically integrated company had not succeeded thus far because they
needed the concurrence of Naftogaz as Ukraine’s most important shareholder, but efforts at
trying to harmonize operations in the sectors in which the group operates are going on™? and
that in any event the initial share purchase was conceived as an entry ticket to the prospect of
further acquisitions.*” It is also of interest to note that of the US$ 720 million paid at this stage
by Korsan for the shares in Ukttatnafta, only US$ 200 million related to the assets bought and
the balance was related to building up the company’s working capital and other needs.**"

The Tribunal is also mindful that cumulative and composite acts and omissions are a well
established principle governing liability under international law as evidenced by Article 15 of
the International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility. The Claimant’s arguments

to this effect are well supported by the jurisprudence of tribunals and writers.**?

THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE “COMPLETE AND UNCONDITIONAL LEGAL PROTECTION”

Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT requires the Respondent to provide “complete and
unconditional legal protection” to qualifying investments, as follows:
Each of the Contracting Parties guarantees in accordance with its legislation the complete

and unconditional legal protection of: investments made by investors of the other
Contracting Party.

4. ‘The Claimant’s Position
(a) The Claimant’s Interpretation of Article (2) of the BIT

‘The Claimant interprets Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT in accordance with Article 31(1)
of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”).°* Relying on what it takes to be
the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 2(2), the Claimant interprets the provision as
requiring the Respondent to ensure that Russian investments enjoy the protection of Ukrainian
law and to refrain from conduct that would deprive the said investments of this protection.°* It
thereby characterizes Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT as “an assurance to the investor
that the [host State’s] laws will be applied,”** which means that the “failure to comply with the
national law to which a treaty refers will have an international effect.”**° As an example of such
an “international effect” of domestic law breaches, the Claimant refers to Bogdanov v. Moldova,
where the tribunal found that Moldova’s violations of its own law breached Article 2(2) of the
Russia-Moldova BIT. The Russia-Moldova BIT requires Moldova to guarantee “under its
legislation a complete and unconditional legal protection of the capital investments” of Russian

investors.°*”

The Claimant contends that the immediate context of paragraph 2 of Article 2 within the Russia~

335.

Ukraine BIT confirms its interpretation of the provision; it observes that paragraph 1 of
Article 2 requires the Contracting Parties to “encourage investors of the other Contracting Party
to make investments in its territory.” The Claimant further considers its interpretation of
Article 2(2) confirmed by the object and purpose of the Russia-Ukraine BIT—as stated in its
Preamble—“to create and maintain favorable conditions for mutual investments,” of which the
application of the law is a crucial element.>**
336. The Claimant draws further support from Article 7 of the Agreement on Cooperation in the
Field of Investment Activity dated 24 December 1993 (“1993 Investment Cooperation

Agreement”), which was open to signature by all member-States of the Commonwealth of

553 Pursuant to Article 31(1), an international treaty must “be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and
purpose.” Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331 (CLA-16).

Independent States.” The Claimant alleges that the 1993 Investment Cooperation Agreement
requires the contracting parties to provide compensation for State actions that are inconsistent
with legislation, and that that Agreement formed the basis of Article 2(2). As the Claimant
points out, the Preamble of the Russia-Ukraine BIT acknowledges that the BIT is “seeking to

develop the main provisions of the [1993 Investment Cooperation Agreement].”°°°

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s interpretation of Article 2(2), which it characterizes as
requiring a “heightened showing such as miscarriage of justice.”**' It differentiates the
investment treaty awards cited by the Respondent to support its position by pointing to the
phrase “in accordance with its legislation” in Article 2(2).°° The Claimant contends that this
phrase has the effect of setting compliance with Ukrainian law as the applicable standard for
state conduct, to the exclusion of the customary international law minimum standard or an
autonomous treaty standard, thereby equating the violation of a State of its domestic law with a
treaty violation or a breach of an international obligation.** It also argues that the substance of

these awards do not in fact support the position of the Respondent.***

(b) Application of Article 2(2) of the BIT to the Facts

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent violated Article 2(2) in several ways: it failed to
prevent—and later provided legal sanction to—the raid, thereby denying the Claimant’s
investments of the basic protections under the Ukrainian Civil Code, the Code of Civil

565

Procedure, and the Enforcement Law;*° it deprived the Claimant of its shareholding in

Ukrtatnafta in court decisions—namely, Cases 32/1 and 17/178—that ignored the applicable

"Claimant of its indirect shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta, held by AmRuz and Seagroup, in Cases
28/128 and 28/129, which were improperly reopened, and by subsequently allowing
Mr. Oveharenko to sell these shares that had been improperly appropriated.*””

. Even if the court decisions had been issued in compliance with Ukrainian law, which is denied,
the Claimant argues that Ukraine in issuing them failed to provide effective means- for the

assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights with respect to Tatneft’s investment.°

2. The Respondent’s Position
(a) | The Respondent’s Interpretation of Article 2(2) of the BIT

340. While the Respondent accepts the Claimant’s view that Article 2(2) “entitle[s] Russian
investments to the protection of Ukrainian law and impose[s] on Ukraine a corollary obligation
to ensure the enjoyment of such protection and refrain from conduct that deprives Russian
investments of the legal protection of Ukrainian law,”*® the Respondent stresses that a breach

of Article 2(2) can only occur if there has in fact been a violation of Ukrainian law. As noted

above, the Respondent denies that the authorities or courts of Ukraine acted contrary to

Ukrainian law.

341.

Turning to the specific issue of the application of the standard of “complete and unconditional
legal protection” to judicial decisions, the Respondent explains that arbitral review of conduct
of the judiciary is relatively rare. Where tribunals were called upon to review judicial decisions,

they had concluded that state courts provide appropriate legal protection when the court is

370

available to the investors for the assertion of their rights’ and when the court’s rulings on those

rights are legally tenable and made in good faith.”

The Respondent rejects the interpretation of the Claimant that the standard of “complete and
unconditional legal protection” is breached by the misapplication of domestic law even when a

court decision is rendered in good faith and is otherwise reasonably tenable.*”

‘Tt questions the
importance placed by the Claimant on the phrase “in conformity with its legislation,” stating
that the “full protection and security” standard (which the Tribunal addresses in the next
section) obliges the Respondent to comply with its local legislation, and that there is no basis to
impose on the Respondent a more stringent test than that for “full protection and security.”°
The Respondent also contends that the Claimant’s argument that a treaty requirement that a
State conform to its domestic law elevates that State’s violation of its domestic law to a treaty
breach finds no support in the sources cited.>”

The Respondent further rejects the Claimant’s reliance on the 1993 Investment Cooperation
Agreement, pointing out that this treaty was terminated in 2002 and was not incorporated by
reference in the Russia-Ukraine BIT. Moreover, the Respondent contests the Claimant’s view
that the Agreement creates international liability for State parties as a result of the mere
misapplication of their domestic law (without any additional improper conduct that would

otherwise breach a full legal protection standard).°”

(b) Application of Article 2(2) of the BIT to the Facts

‘The Respondent contends that it complied with Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT. It
rejects the Claimant’s characterization of the events of 19 October 2007 as a raid, and frames
them instead as the proper i 1 ‘ion of valid court decisions ordering the reii of
Mr. Oveharenko.*”* In particular, it alleges that neither the 26 September 2007 court decisions
reinstating Mr. Ovcharenko’” nor the 19 October 2007 enforcement of these decisions were
illegal.°”* The Respondent also argues that, in any event, Mr. Ovcharenko’s reinstatement could

not have been the cause of the Claimant’s alleged losses.°”

. Turning then to the decisions of the Ukrainian courts complained of by the Claimant, the

Respondent maintains that the Claimant has failed to show either that the Ukrainian judiciary

was not available to it or that the court proceedings were not “reasonably tenable” or not
580

conducted in good faith.
The Respondent points out that there is no basis for the allegation that the Prosecutor lied or was
otherwise improperly motivated in its motion to reopen the prescription period for Case 32/1 or
in its motion to renew the cassation term in Cases 28/198 and 28/199." It further argues that
the Claimant has not shown that the courts that found a valid reason to reopen these cases were

acting improperly.*”

The Respondent contends that the court decisions invalidating the Claimant’s direct
shareholding in Ukrtatnafta did not breach Article 2(2) because the Economic Court of the
Poltava Region, in Case 17/8, reasonably found that it had jurisdiction,** that the claims
brought to it were not time-barred,*** and that the Claimant’s purchase of shares was invalid.**

The Economic Court also reasonably applied Article 83(2) of the Securities Law.*** The

this matter.**”

349. The Respondent also maintains that the court decisions invalidating the Ukrtatnafta shares of
AmRuz and Seagroup did not breach Article 2(2) because they conformed to Ukrainian law.

Even if one were to question the conformity of these decisions to Ukrainian law, the Claimant

   

has not shown, in the Respondent’s view, that these decisions were not “reasonably tenable” or
not rendered in good faith. Specifically, the Respondent argues that the Supreme Court of
Ukraine reasonably remanded Cases 28/198 and 28/199,** and that the Kyiv Economic Court
and the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal reasonably found that the contributions of AmRuz and
Seagroup to the authorized capital of Ukrtatnafta violated Ukrainian law.*” In the Respondent's
view, the Kyiv Court of Appeal reasonably applied Article 83(2) of the Securities Law,*' and
the Higher Economic Court of Ukraine and the Supreme Court of Ukraine reasonably upheld

the findings of the lower court.”

3. The Tribunal’s Findings

350. The conditions under which judicial misconduct triggers a State’s international responsibility
have been the subject of controversy in both arbitral jurisprudence and scholarly discussions.
This controversy extends to the related question of how deferential international courts or
tribunals should be in reviewing the alleged misconduct of domestic courts. These difficulties
are compounded in the present case as it is not only the conduct of courts that it is at issue but
also the participation of the State in many of the facts discussed, either by means of the
intervention of various ministries and State agencies or in particular that of the Public
Prosecutor, an official who in spite of normally having autonomous functions is nonetheless a
State agent. A further difficulty from the point of view of international law is that the judiciary
is as part of the State as any State body arid its independence does not exclude it from engaging
the responsibility of the State as a matter of principle. Deferential treatment of the role of courts

by international tribunals is necessary, above all when their independence is fully established,

t obligations.

    
 

this does not extend to excuse acts or omissions that might be in breach of treaty

The Tribunal must first note in this respect that the traditional customary law responsibility
arising as a consequence of denial of justice by the State courts is not present in this case, in any
event as far as procedural aspects are considered. The courts have been generally available to
the affected parties, although there have been questions concerning ex parte decisions or
proceedings that, while not necessarily constituting denial of justice might be in breach of other
standards of protection. The delay in deciding cases submitted to the courts is not extraordinary
as compared to that which occurs in many judicial systems. Evidence concerning nationality-
based discrimination is not readily available although there has been in this case a clear intent to
substitute Ukrainian interests for those of Tatarstan and the companies related to the latter’s
interests; it is not possible, however, to establish that this was the consequence of discrimination
in terms of nationality, but might also have an incidence in respect of the breach of other
standards of protection. The same holds true in respect of allegations of corruption which have
not specifically identified any such instance and are based on a general perception affecting the

Ukrainian judiciary.

The Tribunal must also note that there is broad agreement in considering that mere errors of fact
or law on the part of the domestic courts do not breach the standard of denial of justice. There
is, however, no consensus on whether a “substantive denial of justice” exists, as opposed to a
procedurally based one, and, if the answer is in the affirmative, what its threshold should be. It
should be noted that in respect of the fair and equitable treatment standard the observance of
both substantive and procedural due process has been occasionally required, as reflected in

SIAG and Vecchi v. Egypt, Mondev and Amto.

   

The early efforts at codification of the law of State responsibility did not ignore this question
and in fact placed considerable emphasis on the view that a manifestly unjust judgment could
well result in engaging the liability of the wrongdoer State, a proposition that at the time was on
many occasions, but not always, considered in the context of denial of justice. On occasions,

too, this was to be coupled with a discriminatory intent towards the protected alien.

Responsibility in light of questions concerning the interpretation and application of the law find,
in addition to those standards that might be found applicable under customary law, a direct link
with the standard of “complete and unconditional legal protection” and the “effective means”

standard found in some BITs. This is the case of Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT relevant

PCA 118005 105

355.

357.

358.

359.

in this dispute, as used in the Energy Charter Treaty and brought into the BIT by operation of

the Most Favoured Nation Clause, to which the Tribunal turns now.

The key phrase “complete and unconditional legal protection” is not further defined in Article
2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT. It thus falls to the Tribunal to determine the content of the
Respondent’s obligation under Article 2(2) in light of the rules governing the interpretation of

treaties and, to the extent necessary, under customary international law.

Case law is not abundant on this point as not many BITs have included this particular kind of
protection. The Parties have discussed in support of their respective positions the decision in
Yury Bogdanov v. Republic of Moldova, the Claimant arguing that it shows the engagement of
liability in view of the Respondent’s non-compliance with domestic law and the Respondent
maintaining that such a case did not concern any action by the courts. The implications of such
a decision for a case in which court action is at the heart of the dispute are not clear and thus
cannot be relied upon by this Tribunal. However, the finding that an investor can rely on the
assurance that the laws will be applied has not escaped the attention of tribunals, as evidenced in

MID.

The Parties have also discussed in this context Article 7 of the 1993 Investment Cooperation
Agreement, providing for compensation if actions of State bodies or officials inconsistent with
the legislation of the State that is host to the investment result in damages to the investor. While
this Agreement has a nexus to the BIT in light of the latter’s Preamble, it is not specific enough
to help in the interpretation of such BIT, in addition to the fact that the Agreement was never

ratified by Russia and even temporary application was terminated.

The Tribunal is also mindful that this discussion is linked to the requirement of ensuring that the
protected person will have effective means available for the assertion of claims and the
enforcement of rights as emphasized in Parkerings v. Lithuania. This is the case of the instant
dispute, as Article 10(12) of the Energy Charter Treaty—as incorporated in the Russia-Ukraine
BIT through the most-favoured nation clause found in Article 3(1)—explicitly contains this

requirement in respect of the protection of the investment.

The Parties have discussed the case Amto v. Ukraine in connection to this particular
requirement, which although it dealt with the question of having legislation for the protection of
property and contractual rights available, was not concerned with the kind of judicial conduct
here complained of. This particular decision. is thus of little help in providing guidance in the

interpretation of this standard. Of greater relevance are the cases of Chevron v. Ecuador and

PCA 118005, 106

 

 

fe Industries v. India. The tribunal in the former understood a similar provision of the

plicable BIT as closely related to the customary law standard of denial of justice, but noted

“that under the BIT the test might be less demanding that under the denial of justice. The latter
case was more explicit in identifying the contents of the effective means standard, mainly in

conjunction with issues of delay in court proceedings that were of relevance in that case.

This Tribunal must note that both decisions corroborate to an extent the proposition that the
customary law denial of justice test has not remained unchanged since first formulated and that
the current understanding that customary law has evolved so as to become more closely
identified with the applicable treaty standards is the prevalent approach. The Respondent,

however, views such decisions as inapposite to this case as they dealt with long delays in the

court system of 13 and 9 years respectively.

In light of the facts of this case, the Tribunal has concluded above that there are no grounds for a
finding of denial of justice. The observance of the BIT standards discussed in this connection is
open to greater doubt as there are elements of the factual record that could lead in the direction
of a breach as far as the compliance with domestic law is concerned, but not so in respect of the
effective means standard as the court system has been generally available, with some limited
exceptions. These questions, however, are inseparable from the discussion and findings
concerning other BIT standards, in particular the fair and equitable treatment, within which such
questions are subsumed. While the individuality of Article 2(2) might be justified in the context

of certain disputes, in the instant case all of its relevant elements are indistinguishable from the

The Claimant posits that Article 3(1) of the BIT has the effect of incorporating the more

favorable treatment protections accorded to investors of third States into the Russia-Ukraine

BIT,** and the Respondent does not oppose this position in principle.*°* However, the Parties

disagree as to how the protections under the UK-Ukraine BIT and the ECT are to be

interpreted—in particular in relation to alleged judicial wrongs—and whether any of these

protections has been breached by Ukraine in the present case.

i. Fair and Equitable Treatment
(a) The Claimant’s Position

ty The Claimant’s Interpretation of the “Fair and Equitable Treatment”
Standard

The Claimant states that the application of the fair and equitable treatment standard, which is
not further defined in the UK-Ukraine BIT, depends on the facts of each case. However, fair and

equitable treatment clearly encompasses fundamental legal standards.°°"’ The Claimant specifies

t unreasonable or arbitrary conduct; the obligation to accord substantive and procedural
process; *” the obligation not to deny justice; the obligation to ensure a stable and
predictable legal framework in conformity with general principles of legal certainty, the statute
of limitations and res judicata;" the protection of the investor’s legitimate expectations with
respect to the host State’s law and its application, which includes transparency and the
observation of such well-established fundamental standards as good faith;°” and the prohibition
against discrimination, which is also included as a stand-alone protection in Article 2(2) of the

Russia-Ukraine BIT and Article 2(2) of the UK-Ukraine BIT.©®

In the Claimant’s view, a state’s international responsibility is not exhausted by the concept of
denial of justice. While court decisions that misapply domestic law but otherwise conform to the
international obligation of a state trigger state responsibility only in the event that denial of
justice is shown, court decisions that conflict with a state’s treaty-based international
obligations constitute an internationally wrongful act regardless of whether the court’s conduct

qualifies as a denial of justice.

368. The Claimant argues that the fair and equitable treatment standard is independent and more
protective of foreign investments than the denial of justice standard under customary
international law. In support of its position, it cites EDF (Services) v. Romania and Lemire v.
Ukraine, stating that these decisions do not distinguish between judicial and other state conduct
in reviewing judicial conduct for arbitrariness. Thus, the application of the fair and equitable

treatment standard to judicial conduct is not limited to protection from denial of justice.

369. The Claimant also argues that the awards cited by the Respondent are inapposite. As the
Claimant explains, Mondev v. United States involved the interpretation of NAFTA
Article 1105(1), which specifically equates fair and equitable treatment to the international

minimum standard (that is, the standard of customary international law). Moreover, the Mondev
Award does not differentiate judicial from administrative conduct or limit the fair and equitable
treatment standard to protection from denial of justice.’ RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation
involved an expropriation claim, and the tribunal did not apply its holding that court decisions
must be reviewed for a denial of justice, as it chose to examine the respondent’s conduct as a
whole. Finally, Azinian v. Mexico was adjudicated under NAFTA® and did not involve the
conduct of the Mexican courts.°°

The Claimant contends that the jurisprudence on Article 6 of the European Convention of
Human Rights (“ECHR”), on which the Respondent relies, is also unavailing because
investment treaties accord investors better protection than the ECHR, with Article 6 providing

for procedural protections alone.°"

The Claimant thereby posits that the standard for analyzing court decisions is the “reasonably

tenable” standard.‘

ii. Application of the “Fair and Equitable Treatment” Standard to the Facts

The Claimant contends that the Respondent breached the fair and equitable treatment standard
in the following ways. First, it claims that the Respondent subjected the investments of the
Claimant to arbitrary and unreasonable measures, including the deprivation of control,
management, and ownership of Ukrtatnafta. In particular, the Claimant regards as unfair and
unreasonable the 26 September 2007 court decisions that led to the events of 19 October 2007

and the rei of Mr. O ko"? and the court decisions that deprived the
614

 

Claimant of its direct and indirect shareholdings in Ukctatnafta.

 saiders in Ukraine and which had masterminded the raid against Ukrtatnafta.°*

Second, the Claimant argues that the conduct of the Respondent violated basic requirements of
procedural propriety and due process. In particular, the Claimant refers to the Ukrainian court’s
acceptance of the Prosecutor’s and Ukrtatnafta’s claims in Cases 32/1 and 17/178, although
these claims were barred by the three-year statute of limitations.‘ It is the Claimant’s position
that the Prosecutor’s conduct in these cases was abusive and “represents a clear example of the
misuse of the broad powers that the Prosecutor enjoys in Ukraine.”*”’ The Claimant asserts that
conduct of such type led the Venice Commission to conclude that the Ukrainian Prosecutor’s
powers considerably exceed the scope of functions performed by a prosecutor in a democratic
state, prompting the Council of Europe to require Ukraine to commit to adapt the role of the

Prosecutor’s office to European standards, which Ukraine has not done.°8

375. The Claimant also refers to the reopening of Cases 28/198 and 28/199 after they had become
final.°” It argues that the general principle of legal certainty is violated when a Prosecutor “is
permitted to use remote or, as here, fabricated inconsistencies in case law to set aside the res

judicata effect of a final judgment.”*”

376. Asa further point relating to the violation of the due process requirement, the Claimant alleges
that it was denied the right to participate in Case 17/60, where the Ukrainian courts ordered the
AmRuz and Seagroup shares to be sold at auction, and that the Claimant was denied appeal on
the merits on allegedly preposterous procedural grounds.

377. Third, the Claimant contends that the court decisions relating to the reinstatement of
Mr. Ovcharenko as Chairman of the Management Board and the invalidation of the Claimant’s

direct and indirect shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta evidence the pivotal role of the Ukrainian courts

in the “black” raider attack in this case. These court decisions, in the Claimant’s view, amounted

to a denial of justice because they were clearly improper and discreditable.*

. Fourth, the Claimant contends that the Respondent frustrated the Claimant’s legitimate

expectations by failing to ensure a predictable, consistent, and stable legal framework for the
Claimant’s investments. It states that the Respondent frustrated the Claimant’s expectation that
its status as an Ukttatnafta shareholder would be respected and that the purchase by AmRuz and
Seagroup of their Ukrtatnafta shares would not be reexamined after the Ukrainian courts had
repeatedly upheld them. The Claimant holds that Ukraine violated its Treaty obligation to
provide effective means for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights by enabling a
regime that eventually rendered the statute of limitations a dead letter. It contends that the
Ukrainian regime allowed the Prosecutor to challenge foreign investments regardless of the
length of time that the State was aware of the purported violations.® In the Claimant’s view, a
prescription period may only be renewed in exceptional circumstances in order to comply with
the principle of legal certainty. The fact that a Prosecutor merely claims to not have had earlier

knowledge of certain facts does not qualify as material reason for such a renewal."

The Claimant argues further that the Respondent fiustrated the Tatarstan shareholders’
expectation that the Ukrainian courts would respect the unanimous decision of the Ukrtatnafta
General Shareholders Meeting to reinstate and then remove Mr. Ovcharenko and reinstate
Mr. Glushko as the Chairman of the Management Board.*

Fifth, the Claimant contends that the Respondent discriminated against the investments of the
Claimant by its differential treatment of the Claimant’s, Naftogaz’s and Korsan’s investments in
Ukrtatnafta, in that the Prosecutor took no action against Korsan for the violation of the alleged
parity requirement—when its increased shareholding in Ukrtatnafta, coupled with the 43.054%
stake of Naftogaz, gave the Ukrainian shareholders a 99.895% stake in Ukrtatnafta—whereas
the Prosecutor had brought proceedings against the Tatarstan shareholders for their violation of

the supposed parity requirement. *

(b) The Respondent’s Position

is The Respondent’s Interpretation of the “Fair and Equitable Treatment”
Standard

At the outset, the Respondent points out that neither the UK-Ukraine BIT nor international law
precisely defines the notion of fair and equitable treatment.” The Respondent contends that
this standard protects against a denial of justice when applied to court decisions. Accordingly,
it is mainly concerned with judicial processes and procedures, with the substance of these
decisions being relevant only to the extent that they shed light on the adequacy of judicial
process.’ The denial of justice standard is not breached by the mere misapplication of
domestic law, the Respondent contends, but only by “fundamental unfairness as understood by
reference to international norms,”* which translates to “a grave and manifest injustice” or bad

faith."

382. While the Respondent clarifies that it is not equating the fair and equitable treatment standard to

the minimum standard of treatment applicable under customary international law, it argues that
modern tribunals—such as in Swisslion v. Macedonia®’—have confined their analysis of fair
and equitable treatment to whether there was a denial of justice in a particular case. It argues
that Vivendi v, Argentina and Azurix v. Argentina do not support the Claimants position that the
fair and equitable treatment standard allows the review of court decisions for more than a denial
of justice, as court decisions were not at issue in these cases. Instead, the Respondent
suggests the applicability of Azinian v. Mexico where Mexican court decisions were reviewed

under the denial of justice test.©°

The Respondent also maintains that the Tribunal should focus on applying the denial of justice 2
test to the discrete judicial decisions, and criticizes the references of the Claimant to raider

actions as unhelpful and used only to elicit sympathy for the Claimant’s case.*°

In response to the Claimant’s reliance on the award in Frontier Petroleum v. Czech Republic for
the proposition that the proper test under the fair and equitable treatment standard is whether
court decisions contain a “plausible interpretation” of the relevant law or were “reasonably
tenable,” the Respondent clarifies that, even in Frontier Petroleum, the denial of justice was
equated with procedural propriety and due process.” Even so, the Respondent points out that a
breach of due process does not automatically equate to a violation of the fair and equitable

treatment standard, * unless such breach is fundamental.

ii. Application of the “Fair and Equitable Treatment” Standard to the Facts

The Respondent contends that it has not breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in
this case. First, it argues that the standard of fair and equitable treatment was not breached by
the 26 September 2007 court decisions that led to the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko because
the Claimant has not provided any evidence that these decisions resulted in any grave and
manifest injustice.“ Nor did the decisions in Case 17/178, which led to the invalidation of the
Claimant’s direct shareholding in Ukrtatnafta, or Cases 28/198 and 28/199, which led to the
invalidation of the Ukrtatnafta shares of both AmRuz and Seagroup, and Case 17/60, which
ordered the auction of these invalidated shares, entail a breach of fair and equitable treatment,
because the Claimant has not shown that these decisions were “manifestly unfair and
unreasonable.”

Second, the Respondent contends that the invalidation of the Claimant’s shareholdings in
Ukrtatnafta did not violate the basic requirements of procedural propriety and due process. It
first states that the awards cited by the Claimant to support its position were based on “the

egregiousness of the acts constituting denial of due process,” which cannot be shown for the

courts cases With which the Claimant has taken issue.“ In the present case, the

t states that the Claimant has not proven that the Prosecutor or the Ukrainian courts
643

sed against it or otherwise corrupt; and any allegation of impropriety on the part of

afta would not alter this conclusion, as no liability can be imposed on a host State for the

that the substance of the decisions about which the Claimant complains conform to both
nian law and judicial practice,“ the Respondent states that the Claimant has not proven
Abat the conduct of the relevant courts constituted “a demonstrated miscarriage of justice” or “a
‘ c manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings,” and in fact cannot do so, given that
: the complex issues of both Ukrainian substantive and procedural law were fully litigated before
the courts.” Lastly, the Respondent points out that the damage that the Claimant has identified
as caused by the Respondent’s alleged failure to uphold procedural regularity or due process—
namely, the deprivation of the “control, management and ownership of Ukrtatnafta’—is
implausible as such control, management and ownership was never the Claimant’s to begin

with, given its minority shareholding.**

387. Apart from arguing that the merits of the above-cited cases do not violate the denial of justice

standard, the Respondent also points out that the merits of the said cases do not violate the
Y “reasonably tenable” test, which the Claimant argues should apply. ? The Respondent
moreover argues that the decisions renewing the cassation appeal term or reopening the
prescription term did not violate this standard, as they were in line with both Ukrainian

procedural law and court practice.

388. Third, the Respondent contends that its response to the Claimant’s version of the judicial
decisions that facilitated the rei of Mr. O and invalidated the direct and

indirect shareholdings of the Claimant in Ukrtatnafta show that these decisions do not constitute

a denial of. ‘justice. It also notes that the Claimant has not provided any evidence in support of
its “sweeping accusations” that Ukrainian courts play a pivotal role in the completion of
corporate raider attacks.°?

Fourth, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s invocation of the “predictable, consistent and
stable legal framework” standard for judicial decisions is misplaced, because this standard

applies solely to administrative acts, with the standard for assessing judicial treatment being that

“of a denial of justice or a “pretence of form to achieve an internationally unlawful end.”°?

 

Fifth, the Respondent contends that it did not discriminate against the Claimant’s investments
because the Claimant was not singled out as a defendant in Case 32/1, which was brought
against all Ukrtatnafta shareholders. Case 32/1 sought the liquidation of Ukrtatnafta, which is
inconsistent with the motive that the Claimant would ascribe to the proceedings, namely to take
the investment of the Tatarstan shareholders and give it to Korsan. In the Respondent’s view,
the Claimant cannot and should not be allowed to impose on the Respondent the burden of

disproving unfounded allegations of discrimination.**

(c) The Tribunal’s Findings in Respect of the Fair and Equitable Treatment
Standard

The Tribunal has explained above that denial of justice, at least from a procedural point of view

_ and the availability of access to the courts, is not a finding that could be supported by the facts

of this case in spite of the fact that the judicial process has evidenced shortcomings, some
serious. It has also noted the agreement in considering that mere errors of fact or law on the part
of the domestic courts do not breach the standard of denial of justice. This finding, however,
does not dispose of the question concerning the eventual existence of a “substantive denial of

justice”.

The Tribunal is also mindful of the discussion about whether denial of justice is an expression
of the customary law “international minimum standard” and how this customary standard
relates to present day treaty standards of protection. What is certain is that the “international
minimum standard” has not been frozen at the time when it was first formulated in the Neer

case in the 1920s. In spite of the fact that findings of “egregious” conduct and similar high

a

standards of review have been often associated with the operation of the international minimum
standard and denial of justice thereunder, it is today accepted that customary law has evolved
with time in this respect and that its own standard of protection is not necessarily different from

the widespread treaty protection available at present.

. The Parties to this case, while not disagreeing on the fact that the FET standard is applicable in

light of treaty protection, maintain different views about the meaning of this standard as far as
judicial review is concerned. The Claimant asserts that the FET standard constitutes an
autonomous treaty standard which offers protection beyond customary international law. The
Respondent states that it is not requesting the Tribunal to apply the international minimum
standard of customary international law, but argues that the FET standard prescribes no more

than a prohibition of denial of justice when applied to judicial decisions.

In examining the content of this standard under investment protection treaties and their
interpretation by numerous tribunals it is not difficult to ascertain that it encompasses today at
least: (a) protection against arbitrary and unreasonable measures, discrimination, and denial of
justice, (b) the right to procedural propriety and due process, and (c) the assurance of a

predictable, consistent and stable legal framework.

Although some manifestations of this standard might not be specific to an examination of
judicial conduct they are nonetheless indicative of the intention to ensure that the legal process
governing the protected rights as a whole, including its judicial manifestations, is fair and
reasonable, devoid of arbitrariness, discrimination or manipulation to the detriment of those
tights. The concepts of fairness and equitableness are the reflection of this intended requirement
and show that in reality there is no reason to’ consider that the situation would need to be
different under customary law as presently understood. This also explains why it is most
difficult to separate the treaty standards of full protection and security and complete and

unconditional legal protection from the FET standard as they all point in the same direction.

In assessing the facts of this case the Tribunal has concluded that the events of 19 October 2007
at the Kremenchug refinery were not as peaceful as maintained by the Respondent and certainly
went beyond any normal enforcement of court decisions, particularly from the point of view of
the use of force and physical occupation, including the subsequent participation of the Ministry

of the Interior’s troops to secure the occupation of the plant.

These facts in themselves raise important questions about whether the FET standard was

adequately observed. This determination is, however, inseparable from the discussion of the

PCA 118005 7

judicial decisions that intervened in connection with the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko. The
Tribunal has considered above the issues arising from the decision of the Aftozavodsky District
Court of 9 November 2004 ordering the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko, as well as those
concerning the ex parte supplementary judgment and the ex parte interim measures issued by
the Kriukivskiy District Court on 26 September 2007. It is necessary to keep in mind in this
respect that in Deutsche Bank the tribunal, as noted by the Claimant, specifically found a breach
of FET in respect of an ex parte court order based on limited evidence and where the affected
party was not given the opportunity to respond as due process had not been observed. The
testimony of Mr. Pryschepa at the hearing also confirms that the resolution on interim measures
did not stipulate the voluntary period for compliance associated. with enforcement

nos 65
proceedings.

  

398. As a result of these various proceedings the powers of the company’s governing bodies to have

reinstated and Mr. Ovek again, were oblit d to the benefit of \
those interests competing for the control of Ukrtatnafta on the basis of an interpretation of the
Ukrainian Labor Code that stands in contrast with the provisions of more pertinent legislation,

such as the Civil Code and the Company Law

399. Such approach could well fall within the ambit of judicial error and hence not compromise the
court’s and the State’s responsibility for breach of the internationally guaranteed forms of
protection relevant in this case. The problem was, however, compounded by procedural defects
that also tend to cast doubt on the observance of the due process requirements of the applicable
standards, particularly in connection with the unclear way in which the four resolutions
initiating enforcement proceedings were allegedly served on Ukrtatnafta, until then still under
the effective control of Tatneft and related interests. The view of one witness to the effect that
no service is required under Ukrainian law in respect of requests for the reopening of cases® is

untenable as a matter of due process.

400. The 2007 decisions were also directly geared toward facilitating the powers of the incoming
as far as the izati i ic, financial and other activities of

the company were concerned. As noted above, the complete takeover of the company’s
management was thus achieved and the complete reorganization of the company to reflect this

fact immediately followed. Nor were the criminal investigations of the events at the refinery

carried out. Whether such developments were the outcome of a black raider’s action or not is

jrrelevant to the conclusion that the trend thus far was with each step leading farther away from

faithful observance of the FET standard.

i Had that been the end of the matter the Tribunal might have had difficulty in reaching a wholly

satisfactory determination regarding the observance of FET. But it was not the end of the
matter; in fact it was rather just the beginning. The court proceedings and decisions in
connection with the validity of the Claimant’s direct and indirect shareholdings in Ukctatnafta

introduced other disquieting factors in respect of the observance of this standard.

The Tribunal has noted above that in spite of the modification of the capital structure of
Ukrtatnafta having been unanimously agreed by its shareholders, with the concurrent
participation of high level Ukrainian government officials, the Prosecutor commenced
proceedings before the Kyiv Economic Court on 19 December 2007 resulting in Case 32/1. It
must be recalled that this official had already investigated Ukrtatnafta’s foundation in the period
2002-2003, and that its renewed efforts to reexamine the modifications in question coincides
with the fact that Korsan, the company controlled by the Privat Group, had acquired in January
2007 a 1% shareholding in Ukrtatnafta. The Tribunal’s concerns regarding FET are not
appeased by the increasingly questionable role of the Prosecutor and the connection in time
between the proceedings initiated and the interests of Korsan or related companies in expanding

their control of Ukrtatnafta.

The examination of the various complaints the Claimant makes about the breach of FET allows
the Tribunal to conclude that in some respects this was indeed the case. The Claimant was
beyond doubt deprived of the control and management of Ukrtatnafia, and ultimately of its
ownership. First, it claims that the Respondent subjected the investments of the Claimant to
arbitrary and unreasonable measures, including the deprivation of control, management, and
ownership of Ukrtatnafta. The Respondent’s argument to the effect that such deprivation is
implausible as such control, management and ownership was never the Claimant’s to begin
with, given its minority shareholding, is formally correct, but the reality of the corporate
arrangements that had been put into effect by agreement of the shareholders proves otherwise. It
was Tatneft that had been entrusted with the task of managing the company and while new
corporate arrangements are always possible, in the instant case these did not follow the normal
corporate decision-making process but were the result of judicial intervention and the
reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko. In any event, even if only the status of a minority shareholder

is considered, that Claimant was deprived of ownership is not open to question.

405.

406.

This situation is in itself contrary to the fairness that could be expected in terms of the treatment
of a foreign investor, irrespective of whether such acts might originate in the judiciary or the
government itself, including the role of the Prosecutor therein, particularly in light of the
Prosecutor’s office being an executive organ under the authority of the Presidential
Administration. Due process issues and procedural propriety were, as the Claimant argues, also
compromised in the development of this process before the courts, especially in view of the
again ionable role of the Pr r, particularly as far as the ing of cases beyond
the limits of the statute of limitations is concerned, as this was not an isolated event but a
continuing one. The Tribunal is mindful of the Claimant’s argument to the effect that the overly
powerful role of the Prosecutor in Ukraine has been a matter of criticism because of non-

compliance with European standards on democracy and the rule of law.”

The discussion about whether these various decisions amounted to a denial of justice is
immaterial because what this Tribunal has to determine in the end is whether they were

manifestly unfair and unreasonable. Although the qualification of such decisions being

ly” unfair and on which the R' relies in support of its position,
is not always easy to establish in individual cases, if the process is considered as a whole in light
of the approach explained above, it certainly could not be concluded that it is fair and
reasonable. No decision invalidating direct and indirect ownership of a company could be so
considered unless the reasons for it are overwhelming and unequivocally based on the law
having been gravely breached unless the reasons for it are based on a serious breach of the law.
A case which began on an alleged breach of the Labor Code and escalated to massive

deprivation of ownership does not appear to be justified on these grounds.

The many procedural defects that have intervened in the judicial proceedings discussed also cast
important doubt on the degree of compliance with the FET standard. This is particularly
noticeable in respect of the various ex parte decisions noted and the questions concerning proper
service of some such decisions, with particular reference to the cassation appeal in Cases 28/198
and 28/199. The overall observance of due process throughout these cases cannot be thus

considered satisfactory.

‘expectations by the Respondent of a predictable, consistent and stable legal framework for the
Claimant’s investments, as considered, for example, in CMS and Biwater. The Respondent’s
! argument to the effect that such requirement of FET only applies to administrative acts is not
convincing. A predictable, consistent and stable legal framework is a FET requirement which
ought to be safeguarded in its integrity irrespective of which organ of the State might

P its availability as is well ized under i ional law in the context of
attribution of wrongful acts. It does not matter, as the tribunal held in EnCana,®* whether such
breach originates in the executive branch of government, which is the most common occurrence
in contemporary practice given the sweeping powers of administration, or in autonomous

services, such as the Public Prosecutor, or eventually in the courts themselves,

. Discrimination is a ground for an additional claim concerning the breach of FET as the
Claimant maintains that the different treatment accorded to Naftogaz and Korsan evidences the
intention to target Tatneft, and later its associated interests, as the holders of rights to be affected
by the measures taken. Whether some such judicial proceedings had Ukrtatnafta as a company,
including all its shareholders, as defendants does not diminish the seriousness of a situation in
which every single step was geared towards forcing the exit of the interests originally associated
with the Republic of Tatarstan, in particular Tatneft followed by AmRuz and Seagroup. The
finding of discrimination in such a situation is unavoidable. Even if such measures would not
have entailed nationality-based discrimination, the fact that given identifiable interests are
targeted indicates a discriminatory treatment as compared to that accorded to other interests in

the venture.

409,

Particularly telling is in this respect the argument on which the whole process of deprivation

was started, namely the breach of the parity requirement as originally envisaged, which was
forgotten as soon as the Ukrainian-related interests took over the company, including therein

Naftogaz and Korsan, as if the parity requirement no longer had any relevance.

410. The Respondent’s counterarguments to such claims of breach of the FET are premised on the
understanding that under the international minimum standard, either as expressed in customary
law or as associated to FET, the governing element of a finding of liability is “the egregiousness

33659

of the acts constituting denial of due process,”*”” which cannot be shown for the Ukrainian court

cases concerned, as the Claimant has proven neither that the Prosecutor nor that the Ukrainian

courts were biased against it or otherwise corrupt. It must also be recalled that in the
Respondent’s view any allegation of impropriety on the part of Ukrtatnafta would not alter this
conclusion, as its actions are those of a private party that was not acting under the State’s

control or direction.

To the extent that the international minimum standard can ‘be understood in isolation from its
contemporary association to FET, and furthermore understood as it was expressed at its origins,
the Respondent’s view is correct as a number of tribunals have in fact identified the egregious
conduct as the source of liability in this context. Judicial impropriety, grave and manifest
injustice and bad faith are concepts closely associated to that understanding and indeed have a
very important role to play in the consideration of liability for breach of the FET. But as has
been noted, such high standard is not the only one relevant in the present protection of rights
under the FET. Conduct which might not be as grave as to amount to egregiousness or bad faith
but which nonetheless interferes with the legitimate exercise of rights of the protected individual
might equally qualify as a kind of conduct resulting in liability. This does not alter the
conclusion that the mere misapplication of domestic law is not enough to give rise to liability

absent some kind of adverse intention.

In light of the above considerations the Tribunal finds that the standard of FET has in fact been
breached in this case, first on the ground of deprivation of the investor’s management and
control of the company and ultimately based on the deprivation of its ownership rights, not
excluding discriminatory treatment, coupled with questions of due process rights and the
manner of how what had been a predictable, consistent and stable legal framework resulted in
the opposite. This finding relates not just to Tatneft’s direct interests in Ukrtatnafta but also to
those held indirectly through AmRuz and Seagroup, a matter on which the Tribunal recalls that
in its Partial Award on Jurisdiction it found that there had been a composite act of deprivation in
respect of the latter companies that culminated after Tatneft acquired its interests in them. The
Respondent’s argument to the effect that the events concerning AmRuz and Seagroup occurred
before Tatneft had made its investment in those companies, and thus that the damages claimed
were not proximately caused by such prior events, is not tenable in light of the finding on the

existence of a composite act that links all such events together.

The of the events di: cd can only be i as ing to arbitrariness and

unreasonableness as far as the treatment of the Claimant’s rights are concerned.

Full Protection and Security
(a) The Claimant’s Position
ts The Claimant’s Interpretation of the “Full Protection and Security” Standard

As previously stated, Article 2(2) of the Agreement between the Government of the United

Kingdom, Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ukraine for the Promotion

and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of 10 February 1993 (“UK-Ukraine BIT”) obliges

the Respondent to accord investments of investors of the other Contracting Party the following

treatment:

Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and
equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other
Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of
investments in its territory of investors of the other Contracting Party. Each Contracting
Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of
the other Contracting Party. (emphasis added)

. The Claimant defines the “full protection and security” standard as requiring the Respondent to

provide both physical and legal protection and security to the investments of the Claimant. It
states that the term “legal security” refers to “the quality of the legal system which implies
certainty in its norms, and, consequently, their foreseeable application.”** With specific regard
to judicial decisions, this means that the host State must “make a functioning system of courts
and legal remedies available to the investor’ and that procedural and substantive actions of

the judiciary that are not “reasonably tenable” would violate this standard.°®

ii. Application of the “Full Protection and Security” Standard to the Facts

The Claimant argues that the Respondent breached this provision by failing to protect the
Claimant’s investments from the alleged criminal seizure and unlawful control and management

of Ukrtatnafta, pointing specifically to the participation of the authorities of Ukraine in the

alleged raider action and the failure of the Respondent to establish a proper legal framework and

secure environment for the investments of the Claimant.‘

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that any breach of full protection and security
would require a demonstration that the State had encouraged or fostered the acts relating to the
alleged Kremenchug seizure. The Claimant argues that the State did more than merely
encourage or foster the acts relating to the Kremenchug seizure and in fact authorized and
legitimized them.*” In any event, the Claimant contends that the proposition of the Respondent
is unsupported by legal authority.°* The Claimant contends that the responsibility of the
Respondent results from a combination of omissions and acts from its executive and judiciary
branches, which made the conduct of the Respondent fall significantly below the standard of

protection that the Claimant could have reasonably expected.°?

b) The Respondent’s Positi

i, The Respondent’s Interpretation of the “Full Protection and Security”
Standard *

While conceding that some tribunals have held that the full protection and security standard
requires host states to provide not only physical but also legal protection and security, the
Respondent states that many tribunals have refused to extend this obligation to include legal
protection—presumably to avoid confusing this standard with that of fair and equitable
treatment.”
After a review of the relevant case law, the Respondent concludes that Article 2(2) of the UK-
Ukraine BIT only requires Ukraine to protect the relevant foreign investment from physical

harm or violence.*"

But if the full protection and security standard extends to non-physical harm, the Respondent
argues that the requirement of extending legal protection and security is satisfied for as long as

the courts have acted in good faith®” and in accordance with domestic law.°

ii. Application of the “Full Protection and Security” Standard to the Facts

    

In line with its position that the full protection and security standard only protects the

Claimant’s investment from physical harm or violence, the Respondent first clarifies that the

Claimant can invoke this provision only in connection with its allegation that Ukrtatnafta was : |
forcibly taken over by Mr. Ovcharenko.°” However, in relation to these allegations, the

Respondent reiterates its position that the events of 19 October 2007 constitute the enforcement {

of valid court decisions upholding Mr. Ovcharenko’s employment rights.®” It also argues that,

even if the Claimant could show that an illegal level of force was used in reinstating

Mr. Ovcharenko and that the Respondent participated in this, the Claimant cannot equate the

force used on 19 October 2007 with forcible damage to its investment, because the alleged harm

about which the Claimant complains was a direct result of court decisions.©°

. Ifthe full protection and security standard was held to oblige the Respondent to provide legal
protection in addition to physical protection, the Respondent states that the Claimant has failed
to demonstrate that the Ukrainian judiciary did not act in good faith or that the court decisions

relating to the rei of Mr. Oveh ko or to the i

Claimant, Seagroup, and AmRuz were not reasonably tenable.

(c) The Tribunal’s Findings in Respect of the Full Protection and Security
Standard

423. The Parties’ arguments on this particular standard of BIT protection raise the traditional divide
between those who understand full protection and security as encompassing only physical
protection” and those who believe, as the Claimant does, that in addition to physical protection
it extends also to legal protection and security in terms of both the quality of the legal system

and the functioning of the court system.

Kazakhstan, which the Respondent invokes in support of its position, this standard has been |
identified with police protection, on the opposite end other cases have adopted a broader
interpretation and extended the standard to include legal protection, as is the case in Azurix y.
Argentina, Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, Vivendi v. Argentina, Siemens v. Argentina, and

Parkerings v. Lithuania, all of which are cited by the Claimant in support of its own views.

In this case the text of Article 2 2. of the Ukraine-Russia BIT provides greater clarity on this
di as it iti legal p ion of Claimant's investments “in
accordance with its legislation”. There is here a specific link to the legal protection of the
investment which is not often found in BITs. While the legislation in itself might not amount to
a breach of this guarantee, this is something that might happen in the context of how the

legislation is implemented or applied, which is in some respects the case here.

Another aspect which the Tribunal must note in the context of this discussion is that the issue of
failure to guarantee the legal protection envisaged might equally bring in a close relationship
with fair and equitable treatment. Article 2(2) of the Ukraine-UK BIT, also applicable in this
case by virtue of the operation of the most favoured nation clause under Article 3. 1. of the
Ukraine-Russia BIT (MFN) appears to have this link in mind when guaranteeing both “fair and

equitable treatment" and "full protection and security”.

This link between the various standards of protection explains still a third line of jurisprudence
in which the obligation to provide legal protection is subsumed into the concept of fair and
equitable treatment, as discussed, for example, in Enron v. Argentina, Sempra Energy
International vy. Argentina, and PSEG v. Turkey, the latter also cited by the Respondent in
support of its position. These cases do not exclude the possibility that both standards might have
a standing of their own while mutually reinforcing each other. Issues concerning the role of the
judiciary are particularly difficult to distinguish as to whether they should be treated under one

standard or the other, or both.

The Tribunal has discussed in connection with the facts of this case the events surrounding the
seizure of the Kremenchug refinery and the change in the company’s management that
followed, which is the basis for the Claimant’s assertions about the breach by the Respondent of
full protection and security. The participation of Ukrainian authorities in those events and the
issue of the discontinued investigation by the Prosecutor have also been discussed above. The
anomalies that the Tribunal has noted in this respect, in spite of the evidence being in some
respects incomplete, are sufficient to conclude that indeed the Respondent failed to provide the

appropriate police protection to the officials at the refinery at the time. Particularly telling are

PCA 118005 126

 

430.

   
 

the subsequent participation of the Ministry of the Interior’s troops in such events and the scant

credibility of the argument that they intervened in the capacity of private security at the service

of the company.” The forceful entry into the premises of the refinery and the retention of
certain officials in their offices, just like the carrying of weapons, are all pointing in the

direction of a breach of full protection and security in the realm of police protection and

physical security.

As noted above, the Parties have also argued about the meaning of this standard in terms of its
extension to legal protection, with particular reference to the Claimant’s views that the courts
failed to provide adequate remedies and the Respondent’s assertion that this other kind of
breach would require evidence that the courts proceeded in bad faith or that the decisions
adopted were not legally tenable. The Tribunal considers that these other allegations are
inseparable from the context of fair and equitable treatment discussed above as they are

intertwined with the contents of this other standard.

It should be noted that the role of a prosecutor in connection with full protection and security
has also been specifically discussed in Spyridon, where the claim concerned a request by such
official to the Romanian Supreme Court to reverse and remand an earlier decision and its
acceptance by that court.®*' The claim was rejected as the tribunal found that the request was
reasoned, as also was the decision, and that due process was observed in light of adversarial
hearings and the availability of the opportunity to challenge such request. These very aspects of

due process are those that are prominently required by FET as discussed above.

a “Effective Means for the Assertion of Claims and the Enforcement of Rights”
(a) The Claimant’s Position

i. The Claimant’s Interpretation of Article 10(12) of the ECT

- The Claimant contends that the Respondent breached its obligation under Article 10(12) of the

ECT to “ensure that its domestic law provides effective means for the assertion of claims and
the enforcement of rights.” The obligation to provide such “effective means” is, in the
Claimant’s view, distinct from and less demanding than the denial of justice standard of

customary international law. The Claimant argues that this obligation requires the host State to

establish a proper and effective legal and institutional system encompassing property and
contract laws as well as procedural rules that facilitate the enforcement of such laws in domestic
courts.” The standard of effectiveness implies some measure of success, which can only be

assessed on a case-to-case basis.“

To support its position, the Claimant cites Chevron v. Ecuador, and explains that the tribunal in
that case defined the “effective means” standard as “distinct [from] and [a] less-demanding test”
than the denial of justice test and as requiring the host State to establish a proper and effective

legal institution.“*

ii. Application of Article 10(12) of the ECT to the Facts

The Claimant argues that the Respondent failed to ensure that the Claimant had the “effective
means” to protect its rights arising out of its Ukrtatnafta shareholdings including its shareholder

right to have Ukrtatnafta managed by the lawfully elected Chairman.

With regard to the former, the Respondent’s failure to provide effective means was manifested
in Cases 32/1, 28/198, and 28/199, when the Prosecutor brought, and the courts accepted, time-
barred claims that had previously been decided in favor of AmRuz and Seagroup—in violation
of the principles of res judicata and extinctive prescription. The Claimant argues that the
Respondent’s failure to provide effective means was exacerbated by the court’s denial of
Seagroup’s request for evidence that would have established that the claims in Case 32/1 were
time-barred, the Supreme Court’s subsequent decision to proceed ex parte in reopening Cases
28/198 and 28/199, and the denial of the right to challenge these decisions.*?

To substantiate the Respondent’s alleged failure to ensure that the Claimant had the “effective
means” to protect its shareholder right to have Ukrtatnafta managed by the lawfully elected
Chairman, the Claimant points to the 26 September 2007 decisions, which were arrived at in ex
parte proceedings initiated on the basis of allegedly false allegations. In the Claimant’s view,
these decisions contravened the legal requirements attaching to interim measures and
supplementary judgments. Moreover, the courts in these decisions refused to consider

Ukrtatnafta’s compliance with the 9 November 2004 judgment and the shareholders’ removal of

. Mr. Ovcharenko and rejected the Claimant’s and Mr. Glushko’s challenges seeking to restore
; the company’s allegedly lawful management. The Claimant submits that, as a result, “no
Ukrainian court ever considered whether Mr. Ovcharenko had a right to be reinstated after his
November 2004 dismissal by UTN’s [General Shareholders Meeting].”*"

. In the alternative the Claimant submits that, if Ukrainian law was correctly applied in these
cases as the Respondent argues, the Respondent would have failed to protect the rights of the
Claimant by failing to establish a proper legal system that would have protected the Claimant’s
interests. Specifically, the Claimant argues that it was entitled to invoke the statute of
limitations to protect its interests in the context of a legal system based on law and not judicial
fiat; interpreted as proposed by the Respondent, Articles 71, 76, and 80 of the Ukrainian SSR |
Civil Code would be inconsistent with Article 10(12) of the ECT.°° Similarly, the Claimant |
contends that it is entitled to the protection of the principle of res judicata; interpreted as
proposed by the Respondent, Articles 111(15)-3, 111(16), and 53 of the Ukrainian Code of
Commercial Procedure would be inconsistent with Article 10(12) of the ECT.® The Claimant
also considers that it was entitled to remove or replace the chief executive officer of the
company which was under its control and to have its shareholder rights protected by safeguards;
as interpreted by the Respondent, Article 99(3) of the Civil Code and Articles 76, 151, 152(3),
212, and 213 of the Code of Civil Procedure would be inconsistent with Article 10(12) of the
EGP |

 

(b) The Respondent's Position
i. The Respondent’s Interpretation of Article 10(12) of the ECT

437. Relying on Amto v. Ukraine, the Respondent claims that Article 10(12) can only be breached by
the failure of the host state to establish legislation providing a fair and efficient ‘judicial
system.®" It thereby rejects the Claimant’s reliance on Chevron v. Ecuador and White Industries
on the basis that these cases applied a different “effective means” provision, which was

breached by the undue delays and inaction of the state courts in considering the claimants’

claims.®? Those facts thus distinguish these cases from the case at hand, where the Claimant

does not allege being subjected to undue delays in the Ukrainian courts.

ii. Application of Article 10(12) of the ECT to the Facts

‘The Respondent argues that the assertion by the Claimant of its rights and defenses in several
court proceedings, many of which involved multiple levels of review, prevents it from asserting

that the Respondent has breached Article 10(12).°*

In relation to the various proceedings at issue, the Respondent explains that the courts in Cases
17/178, 28/198, and 28/199 considered but rejected the argument that Ukrtatnafta’s claims were
time-barred, a decision that was subjected to three levels of appeal.®* In Cases 28/198 and
28/199, the Supreme Court found it reasonable to grant the Prosecutor’s application to set aside
the lower court’s judgment, and once these cases were remanded, AmRuz and Seagroup
presented their arguments at three levels of court review.®* And in the proceedings relating to
the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko, the court’s decision to proceed ex parte was based on the
failure of Mr. Glushko to appear. Apart from the fact that these court decisions were sound on
the merits, they were also subject to appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, coinciding with a
lawsuit by Mr. Glushko against Ukrtatnafta and Mr. Ovcharenko in this same matter.”

In response to the Claimant’s argument that the application of Ukrainian law in the stated
instances proves the Respondent’s failure to establish a proper legal system that meets the
requirements of Article 10(12) of the ECT, the Respondent states that the Claimant’s
dissatisfaction with certain court decisions cannot support its claim for breach of Article 10(12)
given the ability of the Claimant, Seagroup, and AmRuz to invoke their rights before the courts
under proper procedures. The “effective means” standard does not guarantee results in
individual cases. As the Respondent points out, the present Tribunal cannot act as an appellate

court and must defer to the decisions of the lower courts.*

(c) The Tribuna i’s Findings in Respect of the Effective Means Standard

The Tribunal has discussed above the factual and legal questions concerning both denial of
justice and the availability of effective means for the assertion of claims and enforcement of

  
 

rights. As liability has already been found in the light of the fair and equitable treatment and full
protection and security standards, there is no need to examine the question of effective means

separately, which is to a large extent subsumed under that standard.

. There is, however, a broader question concerning how deferential arbitral tribunals should be in
respect of court decisions. As this issue permeates the whole discussion on liability it will be

considered separately further below-

‘THE PROHIBITION ON UNLAWFUL EXPROPRIATION
443. Article 5(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT states as follows:

The investments of investors of one of the Contracting Parties, carried out in the territory of
the other Contracting Patty, will not be expropriated, nationalized, or subject to measures
equal in referred to as tiation”) except
for cases in which hy measures are oe in the public interests in accordance with
procedures established by legislation, are not discriminatory and accompanied by the
payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

1. The Claimant’s Position

444. The Claimant argues that the Respondent committed a creeping expropriation or an
expropriation through a composite act by pointing to the series of actions and omissions of the
executive and judicial branches of the Respondent in assisting with the takeover of the refinery
on 19 October 2007 and with the allegedly unlawful management of Ukrtatnafta, which
eventually led to the loss of the Claimant’s investment in the Company. Specifically, the
following events allegedly form part of such a composite act: the 26 September 2007 court
decisions that paved the way for the alleged Kremenchug seizure; the participation of the
Respondent in the seizure and its actions to protect the raiders thereafter; the court decisions
reinstating Mr. Ovcharenko; the initiation of the Prosecutor and the acceptance of the court of
the time-barred claim in Case 32/1; the initiation of the Prosecutor and the acceptance of the

court of the time-barred application to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199, respectively; and the

court decisions in Cases 17/178, 28/198, and 28/199 that resulted in the invalidation of the title
of the Claimant, AmRuz, and Seagroup to their the Ukrtatnafta shares.”

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s insistence that the Claimant is required to establish that
each and every act or omission individually was in and of itself expropriatory™ or that each of
the court decisions in Cases 17/178, 28/198, and 28/199 amounted to a denial of justice,’
although it argues that Ukraine’s conduct would breach even this standard.”

While clarifying that there is no requirement under international law for property to be
transferred to the state for it to be expropriated,” the Claimant argues that the Respondent did
in fact benefit from the expropriation in this case, in that all of Ukrtatnafta’s shares are now
owned by Ukrainian entities, and that the Respondent, through Naftogaz, is working with Privat

Group to create a jointly controlled vertically integrated oil empire.””

The Claimant also states that the alleged expropriation was not accompanied by “prompt,
adequate and effective compensation,” as required by Article 5(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT,
alleging that the Respondent has always refused and continues to refuse to pay such \

While stating that the non-payment of “prompt, adequate and effective compensation” alone

would render the expropriation unlawful, as the conditions of expropriation are cumulative,”°

the Claimant further argues that the expropriatory conduct was also not in the public interest,
because the alleged black raider action threatened public order;”"' was inherently discriminatory

claim of expropriation, but if it were, then the initiation by the Prosecutor of Cases 32/1, 28/128,

and 28/129 was meant precisely to deprive the Tatarstan shareholders of their shares.”

2. The Respondents Position

Because the Claimant’s shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta were invalidated by specific and
identifiable court decisions—namely Cases 17/178, 28/198, and 28/199—the Respondent
rejects the Claimant’s characterization of the alleged wrongdoing as a creeping expropriation.”

In doing so, it states that there is no link between either the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko

  

and the initiation of Case 17/178, which was not done by the Respondent and was in any case
triggered by the failure of the Claimant to contribute properly for its Ukrtatnafta shares” or the
reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko and the alleged non-payment by Ukrtatnafta of its oil

purchases.”!”

The Respondent argues that the denial of justice standard is embedded in the concept of .
expropriation, and rejects the Claimants contention that a stricter standard is warranted.” It
explains that Cases 32/1, 17/178, 28/198, and 28/199, which resulted in the invalidation of the
Claimant’s shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta, did not constitute a denial of justice, and even were the
Claimant to persuade the Tribunal that these decisions were incorrectly decided as a matter of
Ukrainian law, this determination would not be per se conclusive as to a violation of
Article 5.7?

Relying on the decision in Swisslion, the Respondent states that it was entitled to form the view
that the Claimant, AmRuz, and Seagroup had failed to make the investment contributions
required of them and to put that view before the Ukrainian courts.” It further states that the
invalidation of the Claimant’s shareholdings in the said cases does not constitute an

expropriation, because the decisions were not illegal.’””"

Even if the Claimant could prove that the relevant court decisions constituted an expropriation
(which is denied), the Respondent argues that it meets the requirements for a lawful

expropriation.

First, the court in Case 32/1 did not act in a discriminatory manner as it in fact rejected the
Prosecutor’s claim based on a violation of the parity requirement (which the Claimant alleges
was discriminatory).”” The Claimant does not even explain how the Prosecutor’s allegedly
discriminatory intention in Case 32/1 could extend to the entirely separate court decisions in
Cases 17/178, 28/198, and 28/199.”°

Second, the court decisions were issued “in accordance with procedures established by
legislation” because they conformed to Ukrainian law and to the regular practice of the

Ukrainian courts and did not in any case lead to grave and manifest injustice.”* Moreover, the

t”* because the ultimate

beneficiary of the impugned judicial decisions was a private party that was neither owned nor
controlled by the Respondent, the premise that the Ukrainian court system is corrupt is
unsupported by evidence,” the multi-layered judicial process proves that the court decisions
were rendered for a public purpose, the post-decision share transfers were carried out in
accordance with Ukrainian law, and the decisions actually served a public interest, which was to
enforce the tetms that conditioned the contribution of the Kremenchug refinery to

Ulstatnafta.”*

. Fourth, the courts did not breach the compensation requirement of Article 5(1) because the

Claimant, AmRuz, and Seagroup did not, in the first place and as a condition for claiming the
denial of compensation, seek restitution from the Ukrainian courts for the cash that they paid for
their invalidated shareholdings. In other words, the Claimant was not compensated for its

shareholdings because it did not seek to be.””
3. The Tribunal’s Findings in Respect of the Standard Governing Expropriation

The hibition of unlawful

agreements is mainly concerned with the protection of property rights against the government

found in y it

abusing its legislative or executive power. It is thus mostly related to administrative and
legislative acts. The issue of whether in addition an act of expropriation can also originate in the
judiciary, while not in principle excluded under international law and BIT protection, is not a

common occurrence and therefore views on the matter are less elaborated.

The discussion of judiciary expropriation has been inevitably intertwined with that concerning
denial of justice and related standards, such as complete and unconditional legal protection or
the “effective means” for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights. All such

standards are closely associated with judicial conduct, although not exclusively so, and have

462.

been discussed above. It should also be noted that interactions with other standards can be more
complex. The tribunal in Loewen, for example, without sufficient explanation, concluded that

the expropriation claim in that case could not succeed if a breach of FET had not been

 

previously ii thus i ducing a further i ion of expropriation with other
standards of protection. The Saipem tribunal in contrast was of the view that a finding of

judicial expropriation did not presuppose a denial of justice.

Specific instances of judicial expropriation, in which a court decision causes the loss of an asset
in certain contexts, or of court decisions forming part of a process of creeping expropriation
through the intervention of composite acts, have been identified in contemporary jurisprudence
and practice. Saipem v. Bangladesh is one such relevant case; there, the tribunal concluded that
the taking of the investor’s residual rights as a result of the Supreme Court decision annulling an
ICC award was tantamount to measures having effects similar to an expropriation, although it
cautioned that a finding of illegality in this case was of a rather exceptional nature and did not
depart from the “sole effects” doctrine that requires total or substantive deprivation. Similarly in
the Sistem case the abrogation of contractual rights by a court decision was equated to a measure
tantamount to expropriation irrespective of the State organ that took possession of those rights.
In the context of other jurisprudential developments, in addition to the illegality test, other tests
concerning unreasonableness and proportionality have been applied, as held in Occidental

(2012) or in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.

To the extent that a judicial decision forms an integral part of a chain of acts that, taken
together, might qualify as a composite act and result in a wrong inflicted on the affected
individual, such acts can justify a finding of liability under Article 15(1) of the Articles even if
each of such acts individually might not be sufficient for that finding of wrongful conduct.
Examples of specific instances of conduct assessed as a whole, as opposed to isolated aspects,
are found in the decisions in RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation and Kardassopoulos y.
Georgia, although not dealing with the conduct of the judiciary in particular. In Amo v.
Ukraine, however, the tribunal specifically applied this holistic assessment to the decisions of
courts and considered them in their entirety, holding in respect of the effective means standard
under the ECT that the failure to offer guarantees in individual cases are not in themselves a

breach of the standard but might be evidence of systemic inadequacies.”

3. In the present case, the Claimant relies on both RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation and Amto v.

Ukraine to support its claim of creeping expropriation, while the Respondent believes the claim

concerns only a situation of direct expropriation, which it denies having taken place.

_ The facts of this case are difficult to assess in connection to the claim of expropriation, Two

things, however, are certain. The first is that judicial decisions were the specific acts that in the
end resulted in the total deprivation of the Claimant’s rights as a shareholder of Ukrtatnatfa, first
by annulling the share purchase agreement with Tatneft and next by ordering the return of the
shares held by AmRuz and Seagroup, with all shares being held today by Ukrainian-related
interests. The shareholders related in interest to Tatarstan were thus completely eliminated from
the company. Whether these events were linked in their origin to the reinstatement of
Mr. Ovcharenko and the taking over of the refinery is immaterial from the point of view that

deprivation is a fact of the case, whatever the reasons or causes of those decisions.

The second certainty is that the judicial intervention was not given in isolation but was a part of
the complex network of acts that led one way or another to the courts’ determinations. Such acts
include a role of the Respondent’s government in their genesis and development. In spite of the

events ding the rei of Mr. O which also origi in
judicial decisions, sufficient evidence exists to believe that a government hand was involved,
with particular. reference to the role of bailiff Pryshchepa, and, secondarily, the support
evidenced by the subsequent presence on the premises of Ministry of Interior troops, in
facilitating and securing, respectively, the takeover of the refinery. More important than that has
been the unequivocal and questionable role of the Prosecutor in the events that followed. Most
of the judicial decisions relevant in this dispute originated in the proceedings directly or
indirectly initiated by such official. Although the Prosecutor’s motion seeking the invalidation
of Tatneft’s direct shareholding was prompted by the 2007 letter of the Minister of Fuel and
Energy ahead of the rei of Mr. Oveh ko, which in the d view proves
that the claimed losses were not proximately caused by the alleged treaty breaches arising from
Mr. Ovcharenko’s reinstatement,” the Tribunal cannot fail to note that in spite of their
chronology these events are all interrelated. It must also be noted that irrespective of the
autonomy of the Prosecutor’s office it is a governmental service whose conduct is attributable to

the Respondent.

In light of these elements of certainty the Tribunal is convinced that the role of judicial

decisions in this case forms an integral part of acts of greater complexity, which evidences the

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Memorial, 4 52 (REX-145).

existence of composite acts. The precise composition of each series of acts is difficult to
establish, but again here is where their consideration as a whole leads inevitably to a finding on
the existence of conduct, which in isolation might not be enough to engage liability, but in the

aggregate is.

There are, however, other aspects where it is uncertainty that prevails, either in law or in fact.
While there are cases in which it has been held that expropriation need not result in the transfer
of title to property to the State, these are not common occurrences. In the instant case, the

Respondent’s argument to the effect that the State has not benefited from the reorganization of

 

the capital ition of L is incing as the true successor in interest has been
the private company Korsan although the increased participation of Ukrainian interest might

result in an indirect benefit to the State.

The same uncertainty characterizes the question of the intent to expropriate. Whether this is a
strict requirement as argued by the Respondent or one in which it is not the intent but the results
that matter as maintained by the Claimant is again something which in the context of this case
does not come up with enough clarity. Certainly the results are those the Claimant complains
about but in the Tribunal’s mind the intention of all the acts intervening in this case cannot be
established accurately. If intent were to be a required element of expropriation, as Respondent
asserts, the Tribunal has difficulty discerning whether such intent would have been that of the

Respondent, as opposed to it residing elsewhere.

The same holds true of the requirements concerning non-discriminatory expropriation. The fact
that not only Tatneft’s interests were affected but also that AmRuz and Seagroup hold different
nationalities would appear to support the Respondent’s argument to the effect that no
discrimination intervenes in the cases complained about. On the other hand, it is quite evident
that with or without intent all the affected interests were those related to the Tatarstan side of the
equation leading to the formation of Ukrtatnafta and thus the argument that discrimination was
very much present cannot be excluded to the extent that the recomposing of the capital structure

is considered as a whole.

The Parties have also discussed whether public interest has or has not been complied with for
the purpose of qualifying an expropriation as lawful, taking positions that are dramatically
different in what public interest means in this context. Whether all of the above might or might
not amount to a justification of public interest in the context of expropriation is another aspect
where uncertainty prevails. While for the Claimant the public interest requirement has not been

met in the context of the claimed expropriation, the Respondent’s position as noted is that there

PCA 118005 138

  

    
 

ean be no question of public interest involved as there has simply been no expropriation and the
ss beneficiary of the impugned judicial decisions was a private party. But, the Respondent further
maintains, even if considered relevant, the public interest was anyhow complied with since the
aim of such decisions was to enforce the terms that conditioned the contribution of the

Kremenchug refinery to Ukrtatnafta,

It is also to be noted that no compensation has been paid in the present case and that the
situation is no different than a case of direct taking or one concerning the compulsory
redemption of shares, as decided in Rumeli in respect of the latter. The Respondent’s argument
to the effect that the Claimant, AmRuz, and Seagroup did not seek restitution from the
Uksainian courts for the cash that they paid for their invalidated shareholdings is not
convincing.”” The Respondent maintains in this respect that in spite of the fact that Article 48
of the Civil Code provides in case of an invalid agreement for the obligation of restitution in
kind or money that each party has, this has to be specifically requested from the court.”* The
general principle that the courts must decide on the specific petitions of the parties as laid down
in Article 83 of the Economic Procedure Code™ does not mean that a specific provision such as
that of Section 2 of Article 48 of the Civil Code in respect of the consequences of an
invalidation of the agreement cannot be applied by the courts on their own initiative as they

have to decide not just on the invalidation but also on its consequences.

472. On balance the Tribunal must conclude that there are too many uncertainties in the
consideration of expropriation, with some elements pointing towards a positive finding and
others in a negative direction, Even if an expropriation were found to have occurred it would be
of a rather unusual kind. In the circumstances the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to pass
upon the claim of expropriation, especially because it has already found that the Respondent's
liability under the Ukraine-Russia BIT is engaged because of the breach of other standards of
protection under the BIT, with particular reference to FET and the subsumed role therein of full
protection and security and the complete and unconditional legal protection of the investment as

envisaged in Article 2.2 of the Russia-Ukraine BIT.

It must also be kept in mind that the Claimant withdrew its claim for reparation in the specific
form of restitution of its shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta and opted for the claim of compensation
concerning BIT breaches. The Respondent maintains in this context that a party is not prevented

from seeking recovery ina separate claim.” Remedies will be discussed further below.

4, The Tribunal’s Conclusions on Liability and the Discussion of the Standard of
Review

Because the claims in this case arise for the most from the decisions of courts the standard of
review to be applied is still one important aspect the Tribunal needs to consider in finalizing its
discussion on liability. The Tribunal is mindful that in examining judicial conduct as engaging
the State’s liability for the breach of an international obligation there are limits to be observed.
The Tribunal is not an appellate court. Its powers are confined to the finding of whether certain
conduct amounts to a breach of an international obligation and, if so, what are its consequences
and remedies. The decisions in Azinian v. Mexico and Chevron v. Ecuador have tightly
identified these limits, either under general international law, NAFTA standards or some

specific kinds of protection, such as the “effective means” requirements discussed above.

There are, however, certain clarifications that need to be made in this context. That international
tribunals ought to be deferential to domestic courts is a generally accepted proposition which
this Tribunal readily accepts. While deference has been occasionally understood as finding its
limits only in cases amounting to “denial of justice,” and the latter has been again interpreted in
light of the high standards of egregiousness, manifest injustice, lack of due process, offending
judicial propriety, arbitrariness, bad faith and clear and malicious application of the law, this
understanding is again related to the issue of the international minimum standard discussed
above. In the ambit of FET, deference is further limited by a variety of considerations arising
from equitableness and reasonableness. In this sense a decision can be inequitable and
unreasonable without rising to levels as dramatically wrong as those just mentioned, and still

eventually engage liability for the breach of the FET standard.

A second important clarification is that deference on the part of international tribunals requires
the clear perception that domestic courts are independent, competent and above all clear of
suspicion of corruption. While this perception will be many times well supported by the facts

and the reputation of the court system, it has also known exceptions.

jbunals have hesitated to consider the merits of a particular judicial decision for a
determination of the breach of an international obligation and the engagement of liability related
"thereto, a case in point being that of Frontier Petroleum Services Ltd. in connection with the full
protection and security standard, and have rather opted for the test that if it is believed the courts
have acted in good faith and its decisions are reasonably tenable there should be no finding of
liability. And even where a tribunal has considered the merits of a court decision, as in
Mohammad Ammar Al-Bahloul v. Republic of Tajikistan, the reasonably tenable test has

prevailed.

A further elaboration of deference is found in the case of Chevron v. Ecuador and its reliance on
the test of whether a decision has resulted in “manifest injustice”, in which case deference might
not be justified, a concept which in turn is measured in light of what can be regarded as
“reasonably tenable” or a conclusion that can be “legitimately reached” or that is “juridically
possible”. But even then deference might not extend to other defects of a court decision, such as
undue delay. These distinctions suggest that different standards of review might apply in

relation to different types of wrong.

This Tribunal, having examined the various court decisions complained of and the arguments on
which they are based, is not at ease with an unrestricted application of the standard of deference.
Some aspects of such decisions can be considered reasonably tenable, but these are rather
exceptional. For the most part, the explanation given by the courts in support of their findings
have not been convincing and appear rather as an endorsement of the Prosecutor’s arguments,
not unrelated to those of the interests behind such arguments. This does not necessarily mean
that bad faith might have intervened, at least not in all cases, but it certainly requires that the

standard of deference be appropriately qualified.

The Tribunal accordingly has followed an approach in which the merits of the various decisions
have in fact been examined in order to determine whether they can be considered as fully.
compliant with the BIT standards of protection, a test which in some respects has been
successful but in others not. Deference is thus not automatic and certainly does not require that
extreme forms of misconduct, such as egregiousness, be found to establish that breaches have
occurred as a consequence of those decisions. Moreover, the process as a whole must also be
taken into account for reaching a determination on whether manifest injustice has occurred in
the end. In light of this broader perspective, deference cannot stand in the way of safeguarding

treaty standards of protection, and where total deprivation of the Claimant's capital

481.

482.

483.

484,

contributions and of its corresponding shares and rights has been the result of the process,

deference in no way precludes a finding of liability.

The Tribunal has concluded above that in this case there are no sufficient reasons to justify a
finding of denial of justice. However, it is quite evident that the fair and equitable treatment
standard has been compromised by a number of court actions. In this respect such standard has a
broader meaning than the strict denial of justice as understood under traditional customary
international law. Even though fair and equitable treatment is not always regarded as an integral
part of customary law, it reflects the evolution that the very rules of customary law have
experienced in the light of current treaties and jurisprudence. Denial of justice thus becomes
inseparable from fair and equitable treatment and both standards will supplement each other to
the point that they may be considered as expressions of the updated contents of customary law

as presently understood.

THE ALLEGED DEBT FOR PAST OIL PURCHASES

The Parties are also in disagreement as to whether the Respondent owes the Claimant any
payment for oil purchases. This dispute relates to dealings involving Suvar-Kazan, the
commission agent of the Claimant, and Avto, a Ukrainian company that imported Tartar oil into

Ukraine.

On 23 April 2007, Suvar-Kazan and Avto entered into Contract No. 3-0407,”° which was a
framework agreement for the supply of oil to the Kremenchug refinery for the period from April
to December 2007.”” Ukrtatnafta, in turn, purchased oil from Taiz, a Ukrainian company that
had purchased oil from Avto for sale to the Kremenchug refinery, both directly during the
period from May to July 2007 and indirectly in September 2007, through Technoprogress
Research and Production (“Technoprogress”), another Ukrainian intermediary.”* The oil was

delivered from the Claimant to the Kremenchug refinery through a pipeline.”

Pursuant to an agreement with the Claimant, in January 2008, Technoprogress assigned its

claims for oil payments to Taiz, a Ukrainian intermediary, which then assigned all its claims for

oil payments against Ukrtatnafta to Suvar-Kazan, which accepted the assignment on 18 April

2008."

On7 May 2008, Suvar-Kazan informed Ukrtatnafta of the assignment and requested payment of
the amount due.”' In response to this, Ukrtatnafta initiated proceedings in the Economic Court
of the Poltava Region to invalidate the assignment agreement, on the basis that the relevant oil
supply agreements between Ukrtatnafta and Taiz and Technoprogress, respectively, as well as
the commission agreement between Taiz and Avto, contained prohibitions on the assignment of
rights." The Economic Court for the Poltava Region invalidated these assignments on
2 September 2008. The Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the finding of invalidity on
26 March 2009."*

Meanwhile, Suvar-Kazan filed a claim in the Tatar courts to recover the amounts owed to it.”*°
On 5 September 2008, the Tatar court granted Suvar-Kazan’s claims and ordered Ukrtatnafta to
pay the Claimant UAH 2.5 billion.”* In December 2008, the Tatar courts ordered the seizure of
Ukrtatnafta’s shares in Tatnefteprom, which was the contribution of the Republic of Tatarstan

for its shares in Ukrtatnafta, which shares in Tatnefteprom were sold at auction.”

Between 12 and 16 June 2009, Ukstatnafta paid Taiz and Technoprogress the amount that was

due to them under the Contract.”

1. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant alleges that payment was made through an inter-group transfer that was carefully
orchestrated so as to render both Taiz and Technoprogress, which had by then been liquidated,

unable to fulfill their debt obligations to the Claimant.”

In broad strokes, the alleged inter-group transfer or siphoning strategy, which the Claimant

alleges to be typical of raider actions, operated as follows.

On 22 April 2009, both Taiz and Technoprogress opened bank accounts with PrivatBank.”° On
23 April 2009, Optima Trade LLC, which was alleged to have been a member of the Privat
Group, entered into Service Provision Agreements with Taiz, Technoprogress, and Avto.”*!

On 3 June 2009, Taiz was authorized by its management to acquire shares in 18 companies for
the sum of UAH 1.470 billion.” On 8 June 2009, Taiz was authorized to resell these shares.”
These shares were ultimately purchased by Renalda Investments, Ltd, which was allegedly

controlled by the Privat Group, for roughly the same amount.”**

On 4 June 2009, Technoprogress was authorized by its management to acquire shares in five
companies for a total price of around US$ 561 million.” On 8 June 2009, Taiz was again
authorized by its management to acquire shares in six other companies.’*° Also on 8 June 2009,
a sale of these securities was authorized.”” These shares were ultimately purchased by Duxton

of bankruptcy claims against the three intermediaries."* On 1 October 2009, this Court issued
764

decisions deeming these three companies bankrupt.
. It is the Claimant’s position that Ukrtatnafta artificially accumulated debts to these
intermediaries and continually withheld the payments for the oil deliveries owed to Tatneft
through Taiz and Technoprogess until the Privat Group took over these entities. aS By
22 October 2007, the debts owed to Taiz and Technoprogress amounted to approximately
UAH 2.2 billion.” After his reinstatement on 17 October 2007, Mr. Ovcharenko consciously
decided not to pay these debts due to alleged risks associated with the contracts with those
companies. ’” However, only one and a half years later, in June 2009, Ukrtatnafta did pay
UAH 2.2 billion to Taiz and Technoprogress.”* The Claimant’s explanation is that the alleged
raiders had, in the meantime, taken control of these intermediaries, putting mechanisms in place
to ensure that no money could be passed to the Claimant.”

498. The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s allegation that Tatneft’s losses for unpaid oil deliveries
are not compensable because Ukraine did not direct or order the delay of payment or the non-
payment of Taiz and Technoprogress, which means that such losses are not a “natural and
normal consequence” of any treaty violations by Ukraine.”” It first points out that whether or
not Ukraine directed or ordered non-payment is irrelevant since there is “a transitive, but clear
and uninterrupted, causal chain” connecting Ukraine’s violation of the BIT and Tatneft’s losses
for the unpaid oil deliveries. In the Claimant’s view, UTN’s non-payment to the Ukrainian
intermediaries results from Mr. Ovcharenko’s control over UTN, which is a result of Ukraine’s

facilitation of and support for the Kremenchug seizure.”

Citing the ILC’s Commentary on Article 31 of the Articles on State Responsibility, the
Claimant further argues that, in a case where an injury is caused by the concurrent actions of a
State and a private party, international practice does not support the reduction or attenuation of

the State’s duty of reparation.””

Finally, the Claimant disputes the Respondent’s allegation that foreseeability is a further
requirement of finding liability, in addition to having a sufficient causal link between Ukraine’s
treaty violation and Tatneft’s consequential damages, and submits that even if foreseeability
were to be considered a relevant test, it was foreseeable that UTN, after a raider action
facilitated and supported by Ukraine, would not make the payment of oil deliveries owed to the

shareholders that had just been ousted. ””*

2. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent in turn states that the Claimant has no contract with either Ukraine or
Ukrtatnafta for the delivery of oil that gives rise to this claim.’” Moreover, the Respondent
points out that the Claimant’s claim on this specific issue is based on private transactions among.
private entities, and that the Claimant does not otherwise allege involvement by State organs.”*
The payment by Ukrtatnafta to Taiz and Technoprogress, the two Ukrainian importers, via the
parties’ respective commission agents between 12 and 16 June 2009, should relieve Ukrtatnafta
of all responsibility, accordingly extinguishing its debts for the oil purchases. The Respondent
highlights that “it is undisputed that in June 2009 Taiz and Technoprogress received full
payment from UTN for the oil in question, but they never used those proceeds to pay
Tatneft.”"", ””” The only possible involvement of the Respondent would be through the court
proceedings declaring the involved companies bankrupt, but the Respondent alleges that this
took place only after the completion of the so-called siphoning strategy.”* The Respondent
further notes that “[t]he Ukrainian bankruptcy courts, in any case played no role in Tatneft’s

alleged losses,” and this is because the alleged siphoning scheme occurred prior to the
bankruptcy proceedings regarding Taiz and Technoprogress and the subsequent order that they

be liquidated.’””

The d particularly highii the i of blishii ion for the
Claimant’s claim for unpaid oil deliveries. The Respondent submits that it cannot be established
that any breach of the BIT by the Respondent resulted in the Claimant’s loss of payment for its
oil deliveries.”*° In particular, the Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot show that the
reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko (even assuming that such was a treaty breach, which is
denied) was the “efficient and proximate cause” of the losses” or that the Ukrainian courts or
bailiffs involved in it could have reasonably foreseen that losses would be suffered by the
Claimant and in that particular way.”” As regards the former issue, the Respondent points out
that the current liabilities of Tatneft exceeded its current assets as of 19 October 2007, which
means that its financial position was poor and was worsening. “ It also notes that the claim of
Tatneft actually arises out of events that are additional to and separate from the reinstatement of
Mr. Ovcharenko and, as further explained below, can be attributed to private parties, which

means that the State cannot be liable for them.”**

The Respondent also notes that the issues of proximity and causation are linked.”* In relation to
the issue of proximity, it clarifies that the damages claimed must have been reasonably
foreseeable in accordance with an objective standard, or that “the claimed losses would have
been foreseeable to a reasonable man in the position of the wrongdoer.””** The Respondent then
contends that no reasonable person could have foreseen the chain of events that the Claimant

contends led to its unpaid oil sales.”*”

The Respondent also points out that Ukrtatnafta entered into the oil delivery contracts with Taiz

and Technoprogress before Mr. Ovcharenko was reinstated and had therefore never assumed

responsibility with respect to Tatneft, which had entirely assumed the risk of non-payment by

Taiz and Technoprogress.**

Discussing Samoan Claims, the Respondent reiterates that it is insufficient for the Claimant to
show that the Respondent created the opportunity for the misdeeds of private actors.” It
clarifies that this case limits the losses for which a State must be held accountable to those that
immediately result from the State’s international misconduct. ”° The Respondent argues that the
siphoning strategy—which consisted of entirely private transactions that were not connected to
the State—described by the Claimant actually constitutes an intervening event that breaks the
chain of causation between the alleged BIT breaches of the Respondent and the harm

complained of here.”

3. The Tribunal’s Consideration of the Facts and Liability Concerning the Oil
Purchase Claim

The Tribunal must now consider the facts concerning this separate but related claim that Tatneft
has submitted, namely whether the Respondent is responsible for others’ failure to pay for the
oil that Tatneft had delivered to the Kremenchug refinery, and what the role of the various
intermediaries that had intervened in these transactions was. The recourse to intermediaries was

72 related to VAT particularly,”* a policy that has been

apparently justified by tax benefits,
criticized by the Respondent as being contrary to Ukraine’s tax legislation and which appeared
to have used to some effect the address of the trade mission of the Republic of Tatarstan in

Kyiv."

Following transactions entered into in 2007, Technoprogress assigned in 2008 its claims for the
payment of delivered oil to Taiz, the latter in turn assigning these claims to Suvar-Kazan, which
accepted such assignment. At that point, the rights to such pending payments passed from the
hands of Ukrainian companies to the commission agent for the Claimant. Suvar-Kazan soon

thereafter, as explained above, requested payment for the amount due from Ukrtatnafta with the

latter initiating dit to invali the assi The assi were

. The facts of the case on this point show that Ukrtatnafta proceeded to pay in full the pending

amounts to both Taiz and Technoprogress, a step that the Respondent believes should relieve it
of all responsibility as it extinguished the debt. The terms of this dispute do not appear,
however, to be that simple, for the Claimant alleges that the payments made were orchestrated
in a manner such that the amounts due would never reach its accounts. In fact, following
payment both Taiz and Technoprogress were liquidated and their assets disbursed by means of

inter-group transfers without ever allowing the Claimant to collect.

While the legal issues arising from this aspect of the dispute will be discussed below, the
Tribunal cannot fail to note at this stage two facts that are of concern. The first is the extensive
use of intermediaries. Admittedly this is a common practice in the oil trade, but in the instant
case it appears to have been taken beyond normal transactions, particularly in view of the fact
that the oil was delivered by means of a single and continuous pipeline. The Tribunal does not
draw conclusions from this fact at this point but notes that it certainly raises doubts about the
transparency of the process and its eventual propriety.”° The second fact to be noted is that at
this point the intra-group transactions were indeed most active in view of the interest of some of
the Ukrainian shareholders to gain control of Ukrtatnafta. These transactions were not unrelated
to the role of such intermediaries, including their role in receiving and conveying debt payments

made to them by Ukrtatnafta.”°

As explained above, the Claimant believes in this connection that although payments were made
to Taiz and Technoprogress as the intermediaries in the oil deliveries, these payments never
reached Tatneft as they were orchestrated in such a way as to be diverted by means of intra-
group transfers and the liquidation of the intermediary companies.”” It is on this basis that the
Claimant maintains that the Respondent is liable for payment of the amounts owed to Tatneft.
The Respondent believes to the contrary that, as payment was in fact made, it is relieved of all
responsibility towards the Claimant and that whatever claim is pending concerns solely the
relationship between the supplier and those intermediaries. The Respondent has further noted

that Suvar-Kazan holds an enforceable judgment against Ukrtatnafta and that this judgment has

been in part enforced with the seizure in Tatarstan of Ukrtatnafta shares in Tatneftprom for an

amount of US$ 105 million.”*

The Tribunal has expressed above its reservations about the role of intra-group transactions in
this respect, steps that were not unrelated to the role of such intermediaries. The Respondent
also explains that intermediaries significantly marked up prices for the oil sold. This role
notwithstanding, both Parties agree that Ukrtatnafta made the required payments to the
intermediary companies. The issue is thus whether such payment extinguished any legal

obligation to pay for the oil delivered and thereby relieved the Respondent from liability.

The Respondent has convincingly argued that there was no contract between Ukrtatnatfta, or for

that matter Ukraine, and Tatneft for the delivery of oil”

and that many of the contracts
concluded between Ukrtatnafta and Taiz and Technoprogress were done prior to the
reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko when Tatneft was in control of the company. 80 Such
payments, the Respondent explains, could not have been made earlier, as the Claimant

maintains, because the financial situation of Ukrtatnafta had been worsening.**!

It follows that there is no causal link, certainly not a proximate one, between the wrong
eventually suffered by Tatneft and the conduct of Ukrtatnafta, which fully discharged its
obligations in this matter. The Tribunal cannot make a finding of liability in light of the separate
legal and contractual relations between the Claimant and the intermediaries, not even in terms of

the allegation of consequential damages invoked by the Claimant.

To the extent that it could be established that Ukrtatnafta, and for that matter the Respondent,
orchestrated such payments with a view to frustrate the Claimant’s rights, this might be an
appropriate consideration concerning liability in light of the FET. The Tribunal is not insensible
to the argument that intra-group transactions intervened in the handling of such payments, but
does not believe that Ukraine’s intervention has been clearly established as a matter of fact and

this therefore remains a presumption that is not sufficient to conclude that liability has been

: The Parties have also discussed the Samoan Claims in this connection. The Claimant relies on
this decision in support of its view that State conduct creating an opportunity for private parties’
misdeeds is enough to establish a proximate cause linking the damages to the Respondent’s
conduct, just as it relies in this respect on the ILC Commentary on Article 31 of the Articles on
State Responsibility.*° The Respondent asserts to the contrary that what was excluded in that
case were the damages which were not the immediate result of military operations by the

State.

516. The Claimant believes that Ukraine not only created an opportunity for the alleged raiders to
take over Ukrtatnafta but also that the courts and the executive collaborated with them to
achieve this objective and ultimately arranged for the siphoning of oil payments to Privat-
controlled companies.*”* While elements of State participation in facilitating such schemes are
present in the evidentiary record of this case, again principally because of the court’s decisions
on bankruptcy, what is lacking is the evidence concerning the causal link between these
elements and the resulting damage as far as the claim for unpaid oil deliveries is concerned.

Samoan Claims is thus of no avail in this situation.

517. Further arguments have been made in connection with Alpha Projeckholding v. Ukraine insofar
as liability was found in respect of consequential losses arising from the proven fact that the
respondent had ordered the cessation of payments to the claimant in that case, a situation which
the Respondent in the instant case believes to be inapposite, and which in fact is different from

concemed, *” a view which is disputed by the Claimant for whom the liability here is related
puted by

more to torts than to contractual breaches and who therefore contends that foreseeability is nota
basis to limit the recovery of losses.**

The Claimant’s understanding that the unforseeability of damages does not necessarily limit the
recovery of losses is correct and as much was established in the hearing following a question
from the Tribunal.” It is of interest to note, however, that in the instant case when Suvar-
Kazan, the agent for Tatneft, accepted in 2008 the assignment of the claims Taiz,
Technoprogress and Avto had against Ukrtatnafta, it was not expecting any adverse
developments in respect of such payments notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Ovcharenko had
already been reinstated in his position.*!° Whether the action’ of Ukrtatnafta in this matter
amounts to tort or breach of contract is immaterial in this context as in neither case do the
damages arise from a proximate cause originating from the Respondent’s actions. This

remoteness is what the Tribunal does not consider to be compensable.
REMEDIES

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal has concluded that the Respondent bears
international responsibility—or liability in principle—toward the Claimant under the Russia-
Ukraine BIT as a result of its conduct in the period between 2004 and 2007 and the associated
breaches of certain BIT provisions. Accordingly, the Tribunal must next consider the legal

consequences of the Respondent’s breaches of the Russia-Ukraine BIT.

The Parties differ significantly in respect of the standard of reparation that they contend should
apply to breaches of the BIT, the forms of reparation (restitution and compensation) that would
be owed (until the Claimant withdrew its request for restitution) and, in the event that
compensation is owed, the methodology for establishing the appropriate amount of
compensation and interest. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the Parties’ pleadings on these
points. It has also taken due note of the evidence submitted by both Parties and has found the

examination of the quantum experts of both sides at the hearing to be of great assistance in
clarifying the differences between the Parties,

"THE STANDARD OF REPARATION

A first point of contention between the Parties is the standard of reparation that applies for
breaches of the Russia-Ukraine BIT. In short, the Claimant argues that it is entitled to “full
reparation” as defined in customary international law, as it was subject to unlawful treatment. In
the Claimant’s view, the compensation standard of Article 5(2) of the BIT applies only in cases
of lawful expropriation. The Respondent, on the other hand, argues that, should the Tribunal
find liability in principle, the standard of compensation to be applied, whether there has been a
lawful or unlawful expropriation, is that defined by Article 5(2) of the BIT, which replaces

customary international law as a /ex specialis.

1. The Claimant’s Arguments

In the Claimants’ view, the standard of “full reparation” under customary international law
applies to its claims for damages. In this regard, the Claimant recalls the pronouncement by the
International Court of Justice in the Chorzéw Factory case that “reparation must, as far as
possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which
would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.”*!’ The Claimant
argues that the same standard of full reparation is now codified in Article 31 of the ILC Articles

on State Responsibility,*” and has been adhered to by the International Court of Justice,*!

|. The Claimant contends that the distinction between lawful expropriation and unlawful acts, as

set out in the Chorzdw Factory case, has been widely accepted by investment treaty tribunals.”

In this regard, it refers to the analysis of the tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina:

The Treaty thus mandates that compensation for /aw/iul expropriation be based on the
actual value of the investment, and that interest shall be paid from the date of
dispossession. However, it does not purport to establish a Jex specialis governing the
standards of compensation for wrongful expropriations. As to the appropriate measure of
compensation for the breaches other than expropriation, the Treaty is silent. In the Chorzow
Factory Case, the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) set out the following
principles of compensation for unlawful acts by states: [...]. There can be no doubt about
the vitality of this statement of the damages standard under customary international law,
which has been affirmed and applied by numerous international tribunals as well as the
PCIJ’s successor, the International Court of Justice. It is also clear that such a standard
permits, if the facts so require, a higher rate of recovery than that prescribed in Article 5(2)
for lawful expropriations.*"

 

The Claimant also alleges that it would be “unjust”*” to apply the same standard to lawful and

unlawful expropriations as this would render “a lawful and an unlawful taking indistinguishable

in its financial consequences.”**

In addition, the Claimant submits that, even if Article 5(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT were to

extend to wrongful expropriations and other breaches of the BIT, Article 3(1) of the BIT would
mandate the application of customary international law, which provides a “more favorable”***
compensation standard than that set forth in Article 5(2)." In this context, the Claimant rejects

the Respondent’s argument that an application of the most-favored nation clause would exclude

the application of Article 5(2), as “it is in the very nature of a most-favored-nation clause that
less favorable treatment standards are indeed disregarded in favor of more favorable standards
of protection.”*”°

‘The Claimant contends that the Respondent relies on “a single article by one practitioner”*?” to
counter the plain language of the BIT. Moreover, so the Claimant argues, the cases cited by the
Respondent** do not support its position that. Article 5(2) applies to unlawful expropriations
because three of these cases—Wena v. Egypt, Tecmed v. Mexico, and Middle East Shipping v.
Egypt—do not refer to the standard of full reparation, and the fourth case—Goerz v. Burundi—

left the lawfulness of the expropriation open.*”?

The Claimant also challenges the Respondent’s contention that the “Claimant claims losses only
in respect of its claim pursuant to Article 5(1).”**° Rather, the Claimant suffered one and the
same injury—namely “the complete loss of its investment and non-payment for oil
deliveries***'—as a result of each of the Respondent’s breaches of the Russia-Ukraine BIT.*”

. The Claimant maintains that the Respondent's position is “in direct conflict with a large body of

19836 99837

investment treaty awards, as it addresses “exclusively’ the standard of reparation for

violations of Article 5(1).

2. The Respondent’s Arguments

. The Respondent stresses that the Claimant has “no basis” to seek any reparation because the

Respondent has not breached the Russia-Ukraine BIT.** But in any case, the Respondent

observes that “the Claimant claims losses only in respect of its claims pursuant to Article 5(1),

iLe., the alleged expropriation of its direct and indirect shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta.”*

. The Respondent explains that the Claimant’s alleged losses in respect of the breaches of

A Articles 2(2) and 3(1) largely rely on the court decisions regarding Mr. Ovcharenko’s
reinstatement. Since Mr. Ovcharenko’s reinstatement was “lawful,” there is no “plausible
cause” for the Claimant’s claims in respect of breaches under these articles.*"' The Respondent
also asserts that after Mr. Ovcharenko’s reinstatement in 2007 “the Claimant continue[d] to
enjoy all of its rights and property in the shareholdings” until its shareholdings were eventually

cancelled by the Ukrainian courts.**

expropriation in breach of Article 5(1) is set forth in Article 5(2) (cited above). The Respondent
claims that Article 5(2) should apply even to an unlawful expropriation (assuming that such
were proven by the Claimant) because “Article 5 does not distinguish between lawful and
unlawful expropriation.” The Respondent also refers to an article by an experienced
practitioner, Mr. Sheppard, to argue that “[t]he compensation payable [for both lawful and
unlawful iation] is that ibed by the treaty provision,”** Following Mr. Sh d

 

argument, the Respondent maintains that the standard prescribed in the investment treaty as “a
lex specialis” supersedes “the lex generalis” of customary international law in all cases of

expropriation.“

Moreover, the Respondent contends that Article 5(2) should not be disregarded in favor of
Article 3(1)—the most-favored nation clause—because such an approach would ignore what
has been carefully negotiated between and agreed to by Russia and Ukraine: Article 5 does not
entitle investors to “full reparation.”"* According to the Respondent, “[t]he Tribunal should not
be enticed ‘to stray from the path’*” in deciding what compensation, if any, to grant the
Claimant.”** As regards the application of Article 3(1) more specifically, the Respondent
argues that the standard of compensation under customary international law does not qualify as
“a regime provided for investors of any third state” in Article 302”

In addition, the Respondent points out that the Claimant’s reliance on the Chorzéw Factory case
is inapposite because the circumstances in that case differ from those in the present case. Under
the 1922 Geneva Convention that was applicable in the Chorzéw Factory case, expropriation

was prohibited with very limited exceptions, “which were not equivalent to the conduct

requirement in most modem BITs.”* Moreover, the 1922 Geneva Convention did not specify

any standard of. ‘compensation.

The Respondent also claims that the Claimant’s reliance on the Amoco case is erroneous, as the
Claimant actually refers to a concurring opinion of one of the judges of the Iran-US Claims
Tribunal who concluded that a treaty standard of compensation applied to both lawful and
unlawful expropriation.** It further cites a series of awards by investment tribunals, which

allegedly follow a similar approach.**

3. The Tribunal’s Findings

. In view of the fact that the Tribunal has not relied on the claim of expropriation in reaching its
findings on liability, the discussion on its alleged lawfulness or unlawfulness and the applicable

standards of reparation are not relevant for the Tribunal’s conclusions in this case.

FORMS OF REPARATION

Having found that the Respondent has breached the BIT under other grounds and bearing in
mind that the BIT does not specify any particular remedy for such breaches, the Tribunal will
apply the “full reparation” standard under customary international law as described in the
Chorzow Factory case referred to above by the Parties. As mentioned by the Claimant, that
standard has now been codified in Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and
applied consistently by the International Court of Justice, regional courts, and arbitral tribunals.

541. The Parties also disagree on the form of reparation that should be awarded by the Tribunal, if it
so finds the Respondent to be in breach of the Russia-Ukraine BIT. In particular, the
Respondent challenges the Claimant’s view that restitution is available under the BIT. In its
Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant withdrew its request for restitution of its direct and indirect

shareholdings in UTN, together with the control and management rights associated with these

shareholdings, due to “the apparent practical impossibility of restitution”.** In the event that the i

Tribunal awards compensation, the Parties differ greatly as to its quantification.

1, Restitution

The Tribunal notes that, during the course of the Hearing on the Merits, the Claimant did not
pursue its argument on restitution, and, in its Post-Hearing Brief, after indicating in footnote 146
that it is withdrawing its request for restitution, its claim for full reparation calls exclusively for

the payment by the Respondent of damages in the amount of US$ 1.144 billion.

In order to remove any ambiguity, the Tribunal wishes to state that it does not consider the
present case as one where restitution would be an appropriate means to ensure appropriate

reparation to the Claimant.

2. Compensation

As the Tribunal has already ruled that there is no breach of the BIT by the Respondent in
connection with the non-payment of oil deliveries, it needs only to address the claim for the loss

of shares (with interest).

The Claimant requests an award of compensation for losses arising from the Respondent’s
breaches of the Russia-Ukraine BIT.*’As noted above, the Claimant initially requested direct
and consequential damages of “at least” US$ 741 to 842 million. It subsequently totaled its
losses at US$ 793 million to US$ 1.073 billion, “depending on the applicable rate of interest.**”
At the oral liearing, the Claimant requested compensation in an amount of US$ 1.073 billion,
composed of 536 million for the loss of shares (with interest) and 537 million for the alleged
unpaid oil deliveries.** In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant requests compensation in an
amount of US$ 1.444 billion, comprising US$ 591 million for losses related to Tatneft’s
shareholdings in UTN (including US$ 358 million for the value of Tatneft’s allegedly

Claimant’s Post-Hearing Submission, footnote 146.

The Claimant had sought compensation for the alleged loss of its role as the principal supplier of oil to the
Kremenchug refinery in its First Memorial (see Memorial, { 503), but did not quantify its loss in
subsequent submissions and during the Hearing.

expropriated shares and US$ 233 million in interest*”) and US$ 533 million for losses related to
the unpaid oil deliveries (including US$ 334 million for outstanding payment on the oil
deliveries, RUR 1,569,351,070 of tax fees (VAT and associated default interest) and US$ 143
million in interest).** In presenting its arguments, the Claimant relies principally on two expert
reports by Mr. Mark Bezant of FTI Consulting (the “First Bezant Report” and the “Second
Bezant Report”).

. The Respondent argues that the actual fair market value of the Claimant’s direct and indirect

shareholdings is between US$ 7.9 million to US$ 9.6 million.**' In its Post-Hearing Brief, the
Respondent estimates the fair market value of Tatneft’s shareholdings to be no more than
US$ 15.8 million to US$ 19.2 million. In support of its argument, the Respondent relies
principally on two expert reports by Baker & O’Brien (the “First Baker & O’Brien Report” and
the “Second Baker & O’Brien Report”). The Respondent also argues that the Claimant’s claim
for compensation in respect of unpaid oil deliveries is “entirely without merit” since the

Respondent is not liable for any allegedly unpaid oil deliveries.*®

At first, the Claimant estimated that the fair market value of its direct and indirect shareholdings
in Ukrtatnafta is “at least” US$ 204 to 305 million ( in its Memorial)*™ and, subsequently,
US$ 222 million to US$ 358 million without interest or US$ 536 million with interest (in its
Second Memorial).*® At the hearing, the Claimant again estimated that its loss of the shares is
USS 536 million (the same figure as in its Second Memorial, including interest).** In its Post-
Hearing Brief, this amount rose to US$ 591 million (US$ 358 million for the losses related to

the Claimant’s shares and US$ 233 million in interest).

The Respondent first estimated the value of the Claimant’s shareholdings to be within a range of
US$ 7.9 million to US$ 9.6 million.**” Following certain corrections to its report as made by the
Respondent’s expert during the hearing, the Respondent adjusted its estimates to a range of
US$ 15.8 million to US$ 19.2 million, with a midpoint value of US$ 17.6 million.**

(a) Date of Valuation
i The Claimant’s Arguments

549, The Claimant argues that the date of valuation must be determined in accordance with the
customary international law standard of full reparation, pursuant to which the Claimant “is
entitled to be compensated for any increase [in the] value of its investments between the date of
expropriation and the date of the award.”*® It contends that this method of calculation has been
endorsed by investment tribunals, such as those in Siemens v. Argentina and ADC v.
Hungary.*” Accordingly, the Claimant identifies two relevant valuation dates—the date of the
breach of the BIT and the date of the award, and states that the Tribunal should use the date that
would lead to a greater amount of compensation, as the Respondent “would be enriched by the

consequences of its wrongful acts” otherwise.*”!

550. Moreove:, the Claimant argues that the date of breach in cases of expropriation is “the day when
the interference has ripened into a more or less irreversible deprivation of the property rather

than on the beginning date of the events,”*” adding that “this is a matter of fact for the Tribunal

to assess in light of circumstances of the case.”*”>

The Claimant suggests that the dates of breach in the present case are 12 May 2009 and
27 January 2010 for its indirect and direct shareholdings, respectively, since “[the
Respondent’s] wrongful actions and omissions ripened into an irreversible deprivation when
Tatneft’s title to its shareholdings was cancelled.”*”* It states that the Respondent agrees with

the designation of these dates as the relevant valuation dates.*”

ii, The Respondents Arguments

. The Respondent criticizes the Claimant for its lack of specificity in explaining the valuation

date underlying its analysis, and points out that the Claimant’s approach to valuation in its
Memorial appears to conflict with that of its expert.’ It claims that the First Bezant Report
assesses the fair market value of the Claimant’s shareholdings as of the date of the alleged
“black” raid, 19 October 2007, and subsequently decreases that value to reflect a decline in the
relevant industry so as to provide a valuation on the date of the Report. This approach
contradicts the Claimant’s contention that it “should be compensated as at the date of the award,
if [the calculated compensation is] higher than any amount that might be calculated as at an

unspecified date of expropriation.”*””

. The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s approach ignores the provision of Article 5(2) of the

Russia-Ukraine BIT, which provides that “compensation shall correspond to the market value of

namely, 27 January 2010 and 12 May 2009, for the Claimant’s direct and indirect

shareholdings, respectively.’
As a result of the exchange of a first round of Memorials, both Parties therefore now agree that
the relevant dates of valuation for the loss of the Claimant’s direct and indirect shareholdings

are 27 January 2010 and 12 May 2009, respectively.*”

iii. The Tribunal’s Findings

While there is a huge difference between the Parties as to the actual fair market value of the
Claimant’s direct and indirect shareholdings in Uk«tatnafta, they agree at least on the following
points: (a) that the Claimant’s damages have to be measured with reference to the fair market

value of its shareholdings as of the dates on which the shares were taken**!

(it has to be noted
however that the Claimant also argues that the value of its shares on those dates sets the floor
for its losses and that it is entitled to be compensated for any increase in the value of its
investments between the dates of the breach of the BIT and the date of this award" and for its
part, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has not adduced any evidence of any such

increase);°*

(b) that the general definition of fair market value set forth in Mr. Bezant’s first
report, to the effect that an estimate of fair market value should be “unaffected by factors
specific to, or actions taken as a result of, this dispute but reflecting all relevant factors such as
macroeconomic trends, the oil price and fuel emissions standards, for example” should be
used;*** and (c) that the subject of the valuation is Ukrtatnafta as a whole rather than the
Kremenchug refinery only*® .

The Tribunal sees no reason not to concur with the joint view of the Parties concerning the
valuation dates and the definition of fair market value. As to the argument of the Claimant
concerning its alleged entitlement to any increase in the value of its investments between

12 May 2009 and 27 January 2010 and the date of this award, the Tribunal is of the view (as

elaborated on below) that it has not received adequate evidence to conclude that any such
increase ever did occur. The Tribunal will therefore establish the fair market value of the
Claimant’s direct and indirect investment as of 12 May 2009 for the Claimant’s indirect
shareholding through AmRuz and Seagroup of 14.09% of Ukrtatnafta and as of 27 January 2010

for its 8.61% direct shareholding.

(b) Valuation Method

is The Claimant’s Arguments

. In the First Bezant Report, the Claimant’s expert assesses the value of its shareholdings in a

“but for” scenario, projecting the value that the Claimant’s shareholdings would have had as of
15 June 2011, the date of his report, under the hypothesis that the Respondent had not breached

its treaty obligations.

. According to the Claimant, the analysis in the First Bezant Report employs a six-step

approach:*** (a) deriving indicative valuation ranges of the whole of Ukrtatnafta as of October
2007 by using a number of generally accepted valuation methods;**’ (b) adjusting the indicative
valuation ranges obtained in (a) where appropriate to ensure that the implied value of
Ukttatnafta reflects 100% of the value of Ukrtatnafta to a shareholder with control; **
(c) assessing the appropriateness of applying a premium or a discount to reflect the potential of
the shareholdings to impart greater influence or control on a strategic shareholder and/or the
effect of illiquidity and other risk factors associated with minority interests in unquoted
entities;** (d) analyzing the relative strengths and weaknesses of the valuation methods to
derive an estimated evaluation range for Ukrtatnafta as of October 2007;*” (e) adjusting this
valuation range to 15 June 2011, taking account of the general decline in the value of refining

assets in emerging Europe and Turkey since October 2007;*" and (f) calculating the combined

fair market value of Tatneft’s 22.7% shareholdings (including Tatneft’s indirect shareholding
through AmRuz and Seagroup of 14.09% and Tatneft’s 8.61% direct shareholding) in
Ukrtatnafta on the basis of the adjusted June 2011 valuation range.*” On this basis, the First
Bezant Report estimates that the fair market value of Tatnefi’s 22.7% shareholdings in
Ukrtatnafta as of 15 June 2011 is US$ 204 to 305 million, without accounting for the

modernization of the Kremenchug refinery.“

Mr. Bezant subsequently updated his assessment of the value of Tatneft’s shareholdings in his
Second Report on the basis of additional information and industry reports that became available
after the submission of his First Report. He also adjusted the valuation dates to 12 May 2009 for
Tatneft’s indirect shareholdings and to 27 January 2010 for Tatneft’s direct shareholding, using
the same standard valuation methods.*”* Based on these adjustments the Second Bezant Report
estimates the value of Ukrtatnafta as ranging from US$ 900 million to US$ 1,500 million in
May 2009 and US$ 1,100 million to 1,700 million in January 2010. Accordingly, the value of
Tatneft’s 22.7% stake in Ukrtatnafta on these dates would be US$ 222 million and
US$ 358 million.” Mr. Bezant was instructed to add to these amounts the interest that would
be due to Tatneft from the time that had elapsed between the respective valuation dates and the
date of his Second Report; which results in total losses of between US$256 million and

US$ 536 million, depending on which of three interest calculations he was instructed to use.***

The Claimant argues that it provides a “but-for” valuation in accordance with the applicable
legal standard for full reparation.*” In the Claimant’s view, the preferred valuation method,
particularly for difficult valuations, is to utilize and compare for consistency the results of

several methodologies.** The Claimant contends that Mr. Bezant correctly applied this method

in his two expert reports by using five discrete methodologies” to determine the value of UTN

at the valuation dates.°”

The Claimant argues that four out of these five valuation methodologies converge in the
valuation range of US$ 900 million to US$ 1.5 billion in May 2009 and US$ 1.1 billion to
US$ 1.7 billion in January 2010, with an outlier suggesting an even higher valuation.” The
Claimant is therefore of the view that the aforementioned range is a fair and reasonable value

for UTN.””

The Claimant points out that the 2009/2010 sales transactions’® in UTN shares are “the most
compelling evidence” of the value of Tatneft’s shareholdings in UTN™, since they were
preceded by an expert valuation,” resulted from an auction specially organized “to determine a
more or less fair price,”*°* and involved a willing seller (UTN) and a willing buyer (Korsan and
Viloris).””’ In this context, the Claimant argues that its valuation is consistent with the words

and actions of UTN’s current majority shareholder."

The Claimant considers the Respondent’s approach to valuation as “fundamentally flawed”

in the following aspects.

First, the Respondent has valued the wrong entity. It is Ukrtatnafta, and not the Kremenchug
refinery, that should be the object of the valuation, since the claims are based on the loss of its

direct and indirect shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta.?"°

Second, the Respondent’s expert has included an estimation of the Kremenchug refinery’s
performance after the (alleged) wrongful conduct,’"' which is contrary to the “well established
tule” that the effects on a claimant’s investment by the respondent’s wrongful conduct must be
disregarded when assessing a claimant’s damages.” In this respect, the Claimant points out that

the approach employed by the Respondent’s expert was rejected by the tribunal in Amico v.
Indonesia.”

Third, the use of valuation methodologies and relevant information in the Respondent’s expert
report is “selective”? The Claimant points out that the conclusion of the Respondent’s expert
with respect to the value of Ukitatnafta was actually not drawn from any valuation methods
employed in his reports,” and there are no documents to support the Respondent’s calculation
that the net salvage value of the Kremenchug refinery is 2%, or 5-10% in a reconfiguration

scenario, of its replacement cost on a salvage value basis.”!° The Claimant argues that the

Respondent’s expert has disregarded some valuation methods “because they would provide a

valuation of Ukrtatnafia, rather than the Kremenchug Refinery.””"”

. The Claimant also argues that assessing the Kremenchug refinery on the basis of net salvage

yalue is “wholly unreasonable,” as confirmed by another expert report by Jacobs Consultancy
(the “Jacobs Report”).”'* In this context, the Claimant asserts that the conclusions in the Baker
& O’Brien Reports, “which imply that ‘it would be more favorable, financially, for the refinery
to be closed, and the inventory liquidated,” are diametrically opposed to reality.°!? The
Claimant points out that not only has the refinery not been closed but there has also been
significant new investment in UTN: °° The Claimant argues that the likely “real world” future of
UTN is to become an important part of a vertically integrated oil company created by the Privat
Group.!
With respect to the refinery transactions methodology applied in the Baker & O’Brien Reports,
the Claimant argues that the seven refinery transactions selected” were not fairly comparable

923

and therefore this approach was rejected by its own expert.”~ The Claimant also contends that

Baker & O’Brien erroneously excluded the refinery’s leased units in the course of valuation.°*

The Claimant further argues that the deferred replacement value (“DRV”) methodology adopted
by Baker & O’Brien is “unknown to the industry.”®> The Claimant first contends that Baker &
O’Brien used a generic manual instead of performing an assessment of the condition or

serviceability of the refinery’s process units in calculating the remaining life, despite its visit to

the refinery.” This application leads to “unreasonably short” remaining life figures that had _

already been exceeded not merely by the time of the hearing, but by the time of Baker &
O’Brien’s own visit to the refinery.””’ Second, the Claimant argues that Baker & O’Brien
understated the starting point for its analysis by approximately one-third and that merely
correcting the starting value and fixing the incorrect assumed remaining life would yield a
calculated value for the refinery in excess of US$ 2 billion even on Baker & O’Brien’s own
DRV methodology.”

With respect to Baker & O’Brien’s Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) analysis, the Claimant
points out that there are many uncertainties with respect to the data on which the Respondent’s
expert relied to conduct a DCF valuation™” and this valuation approach is unable to explain the
interest shown by Privat Group in Ukrtatnafta.°*° The Claimant also argues that despite having a
unique opportunity to obtain non-public information to aid its valuation, Baker & O’Brien in
fact either chose not to request critical documentation or was refused access to it by the
Respondent or UTN.*! Furthermore, the Claimant contends that Baker & O’Brien assigned a
100% probability to its worst case outcome and did not give any weight to the possibility of
other scenarios.” Finally, the Claimant submits that, in contrast to Mr. Bezant’s utilization of
five different methodologies, Baker & O’Brien’s valuation is unsupported by a single
alternative analysis and is otherwise unrealistic.”

Fourth, the Claimant argues in addition that Baker & O”Brien’s application of a minority

discount is wrong since in the present case no shareholder held a majority but control could

anyhow be obtained through Tatneft’s shareholding; as such, Mr. Bezant correctly decided not

to apply any discount.***

In response to the Respondent’s contention that the Claimant cannot claim losses attributable to

events that occurred prior to December 2007 (such as the alleged raider action of October 2007)

935

in respect of its indirect shareholdings,” the Claimant contends that this is “a fundamental

misunderstanding of Tatneft’s case,” because “[t]his case is not about a single specific event,

but rather a series of actions and omissions.”***

. In this context, the Claimant argues that any damage caused by December 2007 was reversible

because Ukraine need only have allowed the Tatarstan shareholders to return to the refinery and
reinstate the lawful management of UTN as indicated in the public statements of high-ranking
Ulsainian officials, and therefore, the Claimant did not anticipate and cannot be expected to

have anticipated the events of October 2007.”

ii, | The Respondent’s Arguments

The Respondent argues that the First Bezant Report contains “a number of serious flaws,
mostly because it has failed to apply “the most relevant of all valuation approaches—the DCF
method,” which according to the Respondent might have resulted in a negative valuation of the
Kremenchug refinery. °** The Respondent also claims that the Bezant Report has made
“selective use of high-level valuation metrics to determine value” without considering any
discount for the Claimant’s minority shareholding.” The Respondent is of the view that the
non-application of such a discount is contrary not only to standard industry practice but also to

analysts’ valuations of Tatneft’s shareholding on which Mr. Bezant has himself relied.”

valuation.™' First, Mr. Bezant has chosen to disregard the overwhelming evidence of UTN’s
deteriorating financial performance during the period preceding the events of October 2007."
The Respondent points out that the range of values for UTN on 12 May 2009 (US$ 900 million
to US$ 1.5 billion) estimated by Mr. Bezant are 33 to 56 times greater than UTN’s EBITDA in
2006 (US$ 26.9 million), the last year in which UTN earned a profit.°* Second, Mr. Bezant’s
valuation has been developed on the basis of “indicators of value” that are not only unreliable
but also artificial as they bear no conceivable relationship to the reality of UTN’s financial

circumstances.”

In particular, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal should not have any regard to the amounts
paid by Privat Group in three share transactions during the 2009/2010 period, which are one of
the “indicators of value” that Mr. Bezant and the Claimant heavily relied on. First, little
information is available with respect to these transactions.” Second, these three transactions
enabled Privat to obtain more than 50% of UTN’s shares, while Tatneft’s shareholdings (22.7%)
alone would not have enabled Privat to take control of UTN.™ Third, on the Claimant’s “but-
for” theory, these transactions are part of the alleged “black raider” scheme that are at the heart
of this dispute and are therefore of no assistance in determining what a third party would have
been willing to pay for Tatneft’s stake had those “breaches” not occurred.” And fourth, neither
Mr. Bezant nor Tatneft (or even Mr. Kolomoisky) has provided any economically rational basis

for the sums that are stated to have been paid for the shares in question.***

The Respondent argues that a DCF valuation is preferable in the present case.°” To counter the
Claimant’s evidence, the Respondent submits expert reports by Baker & O’Brien, which deploy
a DCF method. In the course of their assessment, the two Baker & O’Brien Reports consider the

Kremenchug refinery’s historical financial performance, the outlook for refinery yields, product

pricing, operating costs, and reported financial losses. The First Baker & O’Brien Report

estimates that the present value of the refinery is negative on a DCF method.”

Given the negative result of the DCF approach, the First Baker & OBrien Report determines
the value of the refinery on the basis of its net salvage value and concludes that the value of the
refinery is between its net salvage value after closure—US$ 50 million—and the value of
US$ 190 million under a scenario that invoives the reconfiguration of the operation to improve
profitability.°*' Accordingly, the value of the Claimant’s 22.7% shareholding falls within a
range from US$ 7.9 million”? to US$ 36.7 million’ Certain adjustments were made in the
Second Baker & O’Brien Report to reflect the value of Ukrtatnafta rather than the refinery
assets alone. As a result of this adjustment, the value of Tatnefi’s direct and indirect
shareholding was estimated to be in a range between US$ 25.8 and 31.3 million..°** However,
according to the Second Baker & O’Brien Report, the adjustments are “far from precise” and do
not affect the expert’s opinion of the value of the Kremenchug refinery on the valuation dates.”

ing the ination of Mr. and before the of the hearing, Baker
& O’Brien informed the Tribunal about a calculation error.°* According to Baker & O’Brien
the corrections were to reflect the exclusion of the Ukrtatnafta balance sheet item “deferred tax

assets”, which was inadvertently included in its previous reports. In its view, it is unlikely that

 

this item could be monetized by a buyer and it should therefore be excluded in estimating a
value for Ukttatnafta. This results in a negative value of US$ 16-28 million for Ukttatnafta’s
tangible assets and a range of US$ 22-174 million for the Ukrtatnafta share value. After the
application of a 15-30% minority discount, the corrected range for the value of the Claimant’s

shareholdings was US$ 15.8- 19.2 million, rather than US$ 25.8-31.3 million.

any case this assessment does not represent the [fair market value] of the refinery at the relevant
valuation dates.”**” The Respondent accordingly estimates that, on a net salvage value, the fair
market value of the Claimant’s direct and indirect shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta on the relevant
dates is between US$ 7.9 million (based on a salvage value of US$ 50 million and a

30% discount for its minority interest) and US$ 9.6 million (based on a salvage value of US$

50 million and a 15% discount®® for its minority interest)”. With respect to the value of the
refinery, the Respondent claims that it remains in the range of US$ 50 million to US$ 90 million
at both valuation dates. °® The Respondent adjusted its estimates for the value of Tatneft’s
shareholdings to US$ 15.8 million to 19.2 million based on certain corrections to its report made

by the Respondent’s expert following his examination at the hearing.”

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal should distinguish between Tatneft’s direct
shareholding and indirect shareholdings, as the Claimant’s indirect shares were acquired only

after the (alleged) wrongful acts.’ The Respondent also argues that its valuation is consistent
with the market trend during the valuation period.°% Moreover, it is not appropriate to take into
account post-valuation date events in valuing Ukrtatnafta, including Mr. Kolomoisky’s opinion

with respect to the value of Ukrtatnafta.*™

In the Respondent’s view, only Baker & O’Brien has provided a reasonable assessment of
Ukrtatnafta’s value, based on its actual financial condition and respecting the valuation dates.
The Respondent also points to Baker & O’Brien’s considerable industry experience.*® In this
context, the Respondent argues as follows: first, valuing Ukrtatnafta on a DCF basis produces a
negative value; °® second, there is insufficient information concerning European refining

transactions to permit a meaningful comparison with Ukrtatnafta for valuation purposes;°”

In response to Tatneft’s criticisms of the Baker & O’Brien Reports, the Respondent first argues
that the fact that UTN and the refinery continue to operate today does not undermine Baker &
O’Brien’s valuation in any way since UTN and the refinery have lost hundreds of millions of

US dollars since the valuation dates and continue to operate at a loss.°”*

The Respondent also argues that Tatneft fails to specify what evidence, other than UTN’s
financial statements, Baker & OBrien should have considered in assessing UTN’s profitability
and cash flows, and that it would not only have been wrong but also reckless had Baker &
O’Brien not relied on financial statements to determine profitability and cash flows in the view

of established practice.””

With respect to the Claimant’s assertion that Baker & O’Brien’s position is “incongruous” since
it has attributed a positive value to UTN while arriving at a negative value on a DCF basis, the
Respondent contends that the rationale of that position has been set out in the Baker & O’Brien
Reports: in order for UTN to have any prospect of providing a positive return to an acquirer on
its investment, significant investment would be required to modernize and restructure the
refinery, which cannot be guaranteed.°” In this context, the Respondent further argues that this

is an entirely conventional approach to take with respect to a company with an unprofitable

business, namely to assume either that operations will be discontinued or that they will be ~

continued if'a way can be found to operate the business profitably.”

In response to the Claimant’s contention that Baker & O’Brien’s assessment is in fact based on
nothing but its own experience, the Respondent submits that “it is an unfortunate truth that some
questions can only be answered, and some assessments can only be made, on the basis of
experience” and “[iJt is precisely for that reason—because the answers are not available from
public sources—that it is sometimes necessary to consult experts, such as Baker & O’Brien and
Mr. Waguespack, i.e., to provide us with the benefit of their experience, and that is what Baker
& O’Brien has done”.°”” The Respondent contends that the Claimant fails to demonstrate or
allege that Baker & O’Brien’s assessment is not honest, professional or independent or that it is
otherwise unreliable.”

Finally, in response to the assertion of the Claimant that the Respondent failed to provide a
valuation in accordance with the “but-for” theory, the Respondent argues that since there is no
showing that UTN’s cash flow would have turned positive in the “but-for world,” there is no

basis to criticize Baker & O’Brien’s valuation in this regard.””

iii. The Tribunal’s Analysis

Having reviewed the Parties’ arguments and evidence in relation to the quantum of the claim,
the Tribunal wishes to emphasize, at the outset, several significant points of convergence
between the Parties’ positions. First, there is consensus that the damages to which the Claimant
is entitled in the event that the Tribunal finds liability must be measured by reference to the fair
market value of its shareholdings as of the dates on which its shares were allegedly taken.
Second, both Parties agree, and have instructed their experts accordingly, that these valuation
dates are 12 May 2009 for the 14.09% indirect shareholding of Tatneft in Ukrtatnafta, which it
held through AmRuz and Seagroup, and 27 January 2010 for Tatnefi’s 8.61% direct
shareholding in Ukrtatnafta. Third, it appears undisputed that an estimate of fair market value
should be “unaffected by factors specific to, or actions taken as a result of, this dispute but

reflecting all relevant factors such as macroeconomic trends, the oil price and fuel emissions

standards”.°*” Fourth, while it is evident that the Kremenchug Refinery constitutes Ukrtatnafta’s
principal asset, there is agreement that the valuation of the shareholdings is a function of the

value of Ukrtatnafta as a whole, and not only of the Refinery.

That being said, the Parties’ experts arrive at starkly divergent conclusions when assessing the
value of Ukstatnafta. While the Claimant’s expert, Mr. Bezant, ascribes to the shareholdings of
Tatneft a value between US$ 222 million and US$ 358 million, the Respondent’s experts, Baker
& O’Brien, quantify Tatneft’s shareholdings to be between US$ 15.8 million and US$
19.2 million. It is evident to the Tribunal that both Mr. Bezant and Baker & O’Brien have
produced ive and well d reports, ied by a i number of
documentary exhibits in support of their conclusions on valuation. The stark discrepancy in
figures cannot be ascribed to any failure or omission on the part of one or the other expert; it
results from a reliance on different valuation methodologies, which in turn require different

inputs and assumptions.

In the Tribunal’s view, none of the valuation methodologies deployed by the Parties’ experts is
inadequate per se. The problem lies, rather, in a lack of reliable data—including information
regarding Ukrtatnafta’s financial performance, the technical state of repair of the Refinery and

the economic prospects of refining businesses in Ukraine—to enter into the equation.

Shortcomings of the Claimant’s Approach

590.

591.

In a situation of factual uncertainty, the Tribunal can understand the general approach taken by
Mr. Bezant, which involved the juxtaposition of various valuation methodologies with a view to
identifying a valuation range in which they converged. However, the Tribunal makes the
following more specific observations that cast doubt on the reliability of the conclusions that

Mr. Bezant reaches when applying these various methodologies in his report.

First, the Tribunal has doubts as to whether the approach of referring to market valuations of
three Ukrainian oil refineries, conducted between 2004 and 2006, and eight European refining
companies, developed in 2007, permits reliable conclusions as to the value of the Kremenchug
Refinery (Ukrtatnafta’s principal asset). The Tribunal is not aware of the specific economic,
technical and financial conditions of those comparator refineries and assumes that the Parties’

experts were in a similar position when preparing their reports.”*' While refineries are no doubt

The Tribunal notes that the three Ukrainian refineries were quoted on the Ukrainian stock exchange only
until 2006, and observes that the market value of these refineries in 2006 are of limited use in determining

594.

subject to comparable challenges, their market opportunities may differ starkly, depending on
the types of crude oil available, geography, political and regulatory conditions, and the prospect
of synergies with companies up-stream and down-stream in the supply chain. Without a detailed
analysis of the conditions under which the comparator projects operate, the Tribunal is not

willing to base its valuation of Ukrtatnafta on a supposed similarity in value of such refineries.

Second, the various valuations of Ukrtatnafta by third-party analysts are of limited probative
value. The valuations published prior to the agreed valuation dates of May 2009 and January

2010 “are not well documented,” as Mr. Bezant himself concedes, while the valuations

 

published in 2011 are necessarily i In all likelihood, the ions, which are all
very short, were based on limited financial data and prepared without knowledge of the
conditions on-site. Presumably, none of the analysts was provided, by Ukrtatnafta or its
shareholders, with any inside perspective of the company. It is thus somewhat paradoxical to
seek to corroborate an informed valuation of Ukrtatnafta, as Mr. Bezant’s clearly is, by

reference to a series of fairly superficial ones.

Third, as both Parties have noted, a valuation based on a refinery’s deferred replacement cost “is
typically not used by buyers and sellers of refineries.”°* The deferred replacement cost of the
technical installation says little about the value of Ukrtatnafta in the specific economic context
of the Ukrainian refining market, with its significant geographic and geopolitical challenges and

equally significant business opportunities.

Fourth, the valuation of Ukrtatnafta through transactions by Privat Group in, altogether, 55.7%
of Ukrtatnafta’s shares in 2009 and 2010 has its own problems, although the Tribunal
believes that these transactions should not be completely disregarded as indicators of value.
When a buyer purchases a majority stake of a company, it will typically pay a significant
premium on top of the share value to account for the acquisition of control (or at least influence)
and for economic synergies that it intends to realize ‘with other companies in its group. The

Tribunal would not rule out that the amounts paid by Privat Group included a substantial

 

the value of Ukrtatnafta in for the agreed valuation dates. Moreover, one of the these refineries stopped
operations in 2005, the second operated only periodically in recent years, and the processing history of
the third is unclear but, in any event, it was not operating at the time of the expert’s report of 2012.
(Jacobs Report, J 4.9) As to the European refineries, Mr. Bezant himself states that none of them
“provides a close comparable to use to value Ukrtatnafta (and the Kremenchug Refinery). (Second
Bezant Report, { 7.4).

premium for control, although precise figures in this connection are difficult to establish. Privat
Group may also have been able to generate unique synergies between the Refinery and other
Privat Group companies, comprising an extensive network of filling stations, that would not be
available to a typical buyer. It is arguable that such unique business advantages should be

excluded as “factors specific to a particular buyer or seller of the asset.”°*°

The Tribunal is also concemed that these acquisitions may have been driven by rather
idiosyncratic motivations that would not be shared by typical buyers. While the extent of Privat
Group’s involvement in the facts underlying the present proceedings remains opaque, the
Claimant’s whole case turns on the proposition that Privat Group was the beneficiary of a
complex “black raider scheme”, in which all composite events need to be viewed together. If
that is the case, the purchase price paid by Privat Group in the sole-bidder auctions of 2009 and
2010 does not necessarily indicate fair market value, which should “exclude[s] factors specific

Jp? 986

to a particular buyer or seller of the asset and rely only on considerations that are

“unaffected by factors specific to... this dispute”.°*”

. Finally, the Tribunal disagrees with a central economic assumption that seems to underlie
Mr. Bezant’s analysis—that the negative financial results generated by Ukrtatnafta from the
date of its incorporation in 1995 to the seizure of the Refinery in October 2007 can be omitted

 

from the analysis. The Claimant has sought to explain its own, and Mr. Bezant’s, refusal to rely
on Ukrtatnafta’s financial statements for that period by alleging their lack of reliability, referring
to the “common understanding that financial statements do not necessarily reflect the value of

29 988

refining assets and companies in Ukraine” °° and stating that “there were considerable

indications that profits were far higher than the sums disclosed in the financial statements.”°”

597. The Tribunal must of course consider with particular caution the overall proposition that the
financial statements of Ukrtatnafta might not accurately reflect the reality of the business of the
company. However, the Tribunal equally notes that the Claimant, who was responsible for the
production of these financial statements from 2002 to 2007, cannot now convincingly argue that
these financial statements should not be relied upon.” Specifically, the Claimant’s witness,

Mr. Fedotov, confirmed that he was in charge of the economic planning and financial
departments of Ukrtatnafta from August 2001 to October 2007, thus assuming the functions of
“financial director by modern academic definition.” Mr. Fedotov certainly did not suggest in
his written or oral testi that he deli is dt ’s financial per!

The Claimant forcefully asserted, but provided no evidence of, such misstatements. On the other
hand, if it were true that the financial statements prepared during that period were indeed
unreliable, then the Claimant should bear the consequences of its own actions insofar as it
cannot now completely disavow the credibility of these statements in the context of this

arbitration.

Even assuming that Ukrtatnafta’s financial statements are not completely accurate, the Tribunal
sees no reason not to believe the Claimant’s fact witness, Mr. Fedotov, in so far as he confirmed
that Ukrtatnafta did lose money during the whole period in which the Claimant was in
control.°” The Tribunal is unconvinced by the Claimant efforts to explain the negative cash
flow during this period by reference to allegedly significant capital investments for the
modernization of the Refinery. As far as the Tribunal can tell, the money allegedly spent seems
to relate more to the maintenance of the plant than to its modernization or upgrade.°*

In consequence the Tribunal considers that the dire financial condition of Ukrtatnafta up to
2007, as evidenced by Ukrtatnafta’s financial records and the testimony of the Claimant’s fact
witness, Mr. Fedotov, is a relevant factor in the valuation of Ukrtatnafta. That Mr. Bezant did
not account for it in any of the alternative methodologies it employed is an evident shortcoming,

which is likely to have resulted in a higher value for the company than objectively justified.

Shortcomings of the Respondent's Approach

600.

Turning to the Respondent’s approach to valuation, the Tribunal wishes to record, as-a
preliminary matter, its agreement with the Respondent that the valuation results of the
“comparable sales methodology” are too speculative on account of there being no truly
comparable transactions.” The Tribunal therefore concurs with the Respondent that the
deferred replacement value (DRV) methodology arrives at too high a valuation. The Tribunal

regards it as proper that the Respondent has set aside these two methodologies.

|. However, the Tribunal does have significant concerns in respect of the analysis of Baker &

O’Brien, which are a mirror image of its criticism of Mr. Bezant’s analysis. While Mr. Bezant
makes too little of the available financial records, the Respondent’s experts rely too heavily, and
uncritically, on the financial statements of Ukrtatnafta, without factoring in any potential
inaccuracy or incompleteness. In the Tribunal’s view, Uk«tatnafta’s financial statements should
be approached with some caution instead of being taken at face value.” The Tribunal finds that
enough doubt about these financial statements has been introduced by the Claimant itself in
view of its responsibility in the management of the company during the relevant period, which

was far from satisfactory.

While the Tribunal believes that Ukrtatnafta’s financial records do provide some indication of
the financial situation of the company (indicating, as noted above, whether it was a profit-
making or loss-making business), it would hesitate to opt for any valuation method that entirely
depends on the accuracy of these statements. The Tribunal therefore shares Mr. Bezant’s view
that the DCF methodology is unsuitable in the present case, as it is too reliant on the financial

statements of Ukrtatnafta..

The Tribunal recognizes that the DCF methodology ultimately does not form the primary basis
of Baker & O’Brien’s valuation. As for the methodology supporting the valuation actually
employed—that of valuing Ukrtatnafta somewhere in between its “net salvage value after
closure” and the reconfiguration of the operation to improve its profitability”*—the Tribunal is
not convinced about the accuracy of the estimate given to the salvage value of the Kremenchug
Refinery. While recognizing that Mr. Waguespack and one of his colleagues visited the
Kremenchug Refinery to conduct an independent evaluation of the condition of the refinery
equipment,” the Tribunal also notes that Mr. Waguespack had limited access to the physical
premises and equipment of the Kremenchug Refinery, as well as to other non-public
documentation that would have aided its valuation.” For example, Mr. Waguespack conceded
that in addition to “the physical viewing of the facilities, and how they operate, we would have

preferred to see more and we asked to see more.”

604. A limited site inspection might not be in itself a problematic factor. However, if the conditiori of

605,

606.

the technical installations of the Refinery itself is supposed to form the basis of the valuation, an
in-depth inspection is called for. In the absence of such an in-depth inspection, the Tribunal
must conclude that Baker & O’Brien made a less than fully informed estimate of the salvage

value of the Kremenchug Refinery.

As regards the quantification of the net salvage value of the Kremenchug Refinery at
approximately 2% of its replacement cost new, and at 5-10% of its replacement cost new in a
“reconfiguration scenario”, the Tribunal refers to the explanation of Mr. Waguespack that the
valuation of a refinery is based not only on financial documents but also on judgment and
experience, as valuation experts may not always receive all the information they think necessary
in order to carry out a valuation.' The Tribunal acknowledges that uncertainty is a constant in
any valuation exercise and that the outstanding experience of Baker & O’Brien in the refining
industry entitles it to use its professional judgment on these matters. However, the Tribunal also
believes that it cannot rely solely on the professional judgment and experience of the
Respondent’s experts, without substantial other evidence in support, to quantify the Claimant’s

damages.

A last comment on the different methodologies is appropriate. The Tribunal finds that the
calculation of the equity value of Ukrtatnafta — namely, the market value of the Kremenchug
refinery plus the total tangible assets, exclusive of the book value of refinery and related assets,
intangible assets, and deferred tax assets of US$ 60-70 million — is compromised by the limited
reliability of the financial statements in this case. The Tribunal cannot ignore the fact, however,
that such limited reliability is as noted in good measure the making of the Claimant itself and
accordingly should not exculpate the Claimant from the more limited compensation the

Tribunal shall award.

The Tribunal’s Findings

607.

1000

The Tribunal is not persuaded that any of the methodologies that the Parties’ experts propose
result in an accurate calculation of the value of the Claimant’s direct and indirect shareholding
in Ukrtatnafta as of the agreed valuation dates. The factual uncertainty in the present case is so
great that none of these methods, which all depend on different inputs of reliable data, can be

deployed effectively.

In the face of such uncertainty, the Tribunal must base its valuation on the best available
evidence. Such an approach is corroborated by commentators!" and well established in the
case law of international tribunals'°”, including the Iran-US Claims Tribunal.'°° While many
aspects of the financial and economic situation of Ukrtatnafta remain unclear, there are
nonetheless some “hard facts” that provide appropriate direction in respect of the value of
Ukrtatnafia. The Tribunal attaches particular importance to the transactions through which the
Claimant purchased its shares in Ukrtatnafta. Neither side has questioned the fact that these
transactions took place or the amounts involved. In the absence of better evidence, the Tribunal
thus takes guidance from the Claimant’s own contemporaneous estimate of what Ukrtatnafta
was worth, as it is implicit in the price that the Claimant found appropriate to pay for

Ukrtatnafta shares.

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides to use the amounts of the share transactions through which
the Claimant acquired direct and indirect ownership as a measure of value for Ukrtatnfta. As a
result, the Claimant will essentially be reimbursed for what it has paid. This approach, in the
Tribunal’s view, most fairly and accurately reflects the value that was lost to the Claimant on

account of the Respondent’s breach of the BIT.

Specifically, in 2000, the Claimant paid US$ 31 million for 8.613% of Ukrtatnafta’s shares.
The Claimant also acquired 49% of AmRuz for US$ 23,940,000 on 18 December 2007" and

‘As explained by Sergey Ripinsky and Kevin Williams, “fiJn circumstances in which the precise
calculation is difficult or impossible, for example due to inconclusive evidence, tribunals may exercise
discretion and resort to ‘approximations’. Approximations are based on arbitrators’ collective sense of
what is reasonable and equitable in the circumstances of the case. One should also appreciate that an
approximation can serve to reconcile disagreements between arbitrators.” (DAMAGES IN INTERNATIONAL.

100% of Seagroup for US$ 57,120,000 on 24 December 2007." Through the December 2007
transactions, the Claimant paid US$ 81,060,000 million for the acquisition of the Ukrtatnafta
shares of Seagroup and AmRuz. The Tribunal observes that this results in roughly US$
112 million in damages for the Claimant, excluding the necessary interest adjustments to

account for the time value of money up to the date of the award.

The Claimant has argued that it is entitled to any increase in value between the shareholdings as
of the agreed valuation date and the date of the award. However, the Tribunal notes that it has
not received adequate evidence to conclude that any such increase has in fact occurred. In
relation to the amount of US$ 31 million that the Claimant paid in 2000, specifically, the
Tribunal reiterates its finding that for most of the period before October 2007, when the
Claimant was effectively managing Ukrtatnafta, Ukrtatnafta did not generate profits. It is thus
likely that there has been no increase in the value of the Claimant’s shareholding from 2000 to
2007. The Tribunal does not have before it any reliable data that would document an increase in

value after 2007.

As regards the US$ 81,060,000 million that the Claimant paid in 2007 for the shares of AMRuz
and Seagroup, the Tribunal considers that this amount represented a fair price for the Claimant,

together with the other Tatarstan shareholding, to assume majority control of Ukrtatnafta.

The Tribunal notes that these amounts are in fact not too dissimilar to the amounts paid by
Privat Group in 2009 and 2010 provided that one takes into consideration the break-down
offered at the hearing by Mr. Kolomoisky. Mr. Kolomoisky testified that Privat Group had paid
a total of about US$ 720 million for its 55.7% stake of Ukrtatnafta, out of which only around
US$ 200 million was paid in consideration of the shares themselves.” The remaining amount
was described as a sort of “emergency cash flow” contribution, made to allow the company to
meet its immediate payment needs. There was no suggestion by Mr. Kolomoisky that any
proportion of this cash flow contribution was invested by Ukrtatnafta in ways that would ensure

that its value was retained in the company.

While the Tribunal acknowledges that the figure of US$ 200 million, corresponding to a 55.7%
equity stake, was merely an estimate by Mr. Kolomoisky, the Tribunal does consider that it
confirms the plausibility of its own valuation of the Claimant’s 22.7% equity stake at US$
112 million.

. To conclude, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant’s shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta are most

adequately valued by reference to the Claimant’s purchase price for these shareholdings. The

Tribunal finds that the total value of these shareholdings amounts to US$ 112 million.

. The Tribunal also highlights that one arbitrator takes exception to compensation at this last

figure and considers that the alternative methodological valuations could not result in a figure |

greater than US$ 52.3 million.

. As it has been noted above, the Claimant in its First Memorial included claims for

compensation for damages arising from unpaid oil deliveries in the amount of US$
414.4 million. As the Tribunal has already concluded above that the Respondent could not be
held liable for the non-payment by Ukrtatnafta for oil deliveries, the claim for compensation in

this respect shall not be considered.

INTEREST

The Claimant requests an award of compound interest on any amounts awarded by the Tribunal
in relation to the loss of its direct and indirect shareholdings and to the outstanding debt of the

Respondent for oil deliveries and the Claimant’s payment of tax penalty fees.

. The Respondent objects to (a) the interest rates proposed by the Claimant, (b) the start dates for

the accrual of interest proposed by the Claimant, and (c) the Claimant’s request for an award of

compound interest.

1. Interest Rates
(a) The Claimant’s Arguments

The Claimant asserts that the principle of full reparation also governs payment of interest.

Citing Article 38 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility as well as arbitral case law,'”

Memorial, | 545. Article 38 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides:

1. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when
necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of
calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.

2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until
the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.

622,

the Claimant states that it is entitled to interest “at an appropriate rate” on the entire value of its
1010

investments in Ukrtatnafta and the sum due for oil deliveries.
The Claimant contends that the interest rate provided for in Article 5(2) of the Russia-Ukraine
BIT—the three-month US$ LIBOR Rate plus 1%—is inappropriate for the reparation of the
Respondent’s breach of treaty obligations. As the Claimant explains, the rate in Article 5(2)
presumes that “prompt, adequate and.effective” compensation has been made in the event of a
lawful expropriation, which is not the situation at present.!°!" The Claimant also argues that the
interest rate is to be set in accordance with the currency “in which the investment was made, the

jon i 291012
harm was caused and compensation is to be awarded.

With regard to its lost investment in Ukrtatnafta, the Claimant argues that the “investment
alternative” approach should be applied, as it has been adopted by many investment
tribunals. '°” It therefore claims that the applicable interest rate should be determined using 10-
year US$-denominated Ukraine bonds, 30-year US$-denominated Russian bonds in the case
that the Tribunal should consider that an investment alternative in the Russian Federation would

be more appropriate, or the applicable rates on US$ deposits in the Russian Federation, in the

event that the Tribunal believes that government bonds are not an appropriate investment

alternative."

(b) The Respondent’s Arguments

. The Respondent argues that the only interest rate that should be applied in this case is the three-

month US$ LIBOR Rate plus 1%, as provided in Article (2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT.
According to the Respondent, “to do otherwise would be to ignore the BIT carefully negotiated
and agreed between Russia and Ukraine.”'*” The interest rate specified in the BIT should

prevail over any interest rates defined under customary international law or Russian law.'"'*

(ce) The Tribunal’s Analysis

. It is true, as argued by the Respondent, that Article 5(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT provides

specifically for the interest rate to be applied in the case of expropriation.

However, the Tribunal notes that no similar provision concerning interest can be found in
connection with damages resulting from other breaches of the BIT. The Tribunal has already
found in favor of the Claimant concerning breaches on grounds other than expropriation. The
Tribunal is therefore free to define the interest rate that should apply in the present

circumstances.

While the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the interest rate mentioned in Article 5(2) of
the BIT is restricted to circumstances of expropriation, it does not share the Claimant’s view
that the applicable interest rate should be established by reference to Ukrainian or Russian
bonds or to US$ deposits in the Russian Federation. The “investment alternative” approach
mentioned by the Claimant and its reference mentioned above to a number of investment awards
does not limit the Tribunal to such alternatives. The Tribunal is of the view that the parties to
the BIT have indicated in Article 5(2) their preferred standard and, while the Tribunal is not
bound by such standard for the reason mentioned above, ‘it considers that reference to the
LIBOR rate would be justified in the present case and notes that such standard has been

regularly used in investment awards. The Tribunal is of the view however that an addition of

3% to that rate would be more appropriate than the 1% mentioned in Article 5(2) of the BIT and

more in line with what is generally awarded.

The Tribunal therefore decides that the interest rate to be paid by the Respondent shall be the
interest rate for three months’ deposits in US dollars at the London interbank market rate
(LIBOR) plus 3%.

2. Starting Date for the Accrual of Interest
(a) The Claimant’s Arguments

With regard to its lost investment in Ukrtatnafta, the Claimant argues that 27 January 2010 and
12 May 2009 should be the starting dates for the accrual of interest for its loss of direct and

indirect shareholdings, respectively.'""”

(b) The Respondent’s Arguments

The Respondent submits that interest should accrue from the date of the Award, which is the
date “when the amount of the sum due has been fixed and the obligation to pay has been

established.”!°

The Respondent disagrees that 27 January 2010 and 12 May 2009—the agreed valuation
dates—should also be used to determine the accrual of interest in respect of the Claimant’s
claim for direct damages, asserting that this proposal “is misguided and ignores established

arbitral practice?!”

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal decides that the interest shall run from the taking of the shares. The Tribunal
recalls that there is consensus between the Parties that the taking of these shares occurred on
two dates — namely, 12 May 2009 for the 14.09% indirect shareholding of Tatneft in
Ukrtatnafta, which it held through AmRuz and Seagroup, and 27 January 2010, for Tatneft’s

8.61% direct shareholding in Ukrtatnafta. The Tribunal therefore holds that interest shall begin

to accrue on the amount of US$ 68.44 million on 12 May 2009, and on the amount of US$
43.56 million on 27 January 2010.

To better enable the Respondent to make full payment, the Tribunal decides that the accrual of
interest shall be suspended from the date of the issuance of the Award to sixty (60) days

thereafter.

3. Compound Interest
(a) The Claimant’s Arguments

The Claimant states that it is the “norm” in investment arbitration to order compound interest,

and requests the Tribunal do so here.'”°

particular, the Claimant refers to Santa Elena v. Costa Rica, where the tribunal stated that “the
amount of compensation should reflect the additional sum that the money would have earned if
[it] had been reinvested each year at generally prevailing rates of interest.”!°" The Claimant
also refers to Wena Hotels, where the tribunal confirmed that compound interest was required in
order to give the claimant full reparation."

The Claimant further argues that many tribunals have awarded compound interest because it
“reflects the reality of financial transactions [today], and best approximates the value lost by an

investor.”"

practice of investment arbitration tribunals with regard to compound interest is “far from

The Respondent further argues that the cases on which the Claimant relies “have failed to
articulate a proper justification [...] in favor of compound interest.”!”” Relying on commentary
by two practitioners, the Respondent specifically asserts that Santa Elena v. Costa Rica, Wena
Hotels v. Egypt, and Middle East Cement v. Egypt were “incorrectly” decided with regard to the
award of compound interest.!°°

According to the Respondent, compound interest should only be awarded in three
circumstances: (a) when the parties have expressly agreed to the payment of compound interest,
(b) when the respondent's failure to fulfill its obligations caused the claimant to incur financing
costs on which it paid compound interest, or (c) when the claimant can prove that it would have
earned compound interest in the normal course of business on the money owed, had it been paid
in a timely manner.'®! The Respondent asserts that the Claimant failed to plead any such

circumstances that may warrant compound interest.'°?

that the Claimant has cited several previous awards which reached the same conclusion. The
Respondent shall therefore pay interest compounded every three months on amounts owing at

the rate mentioned above.
