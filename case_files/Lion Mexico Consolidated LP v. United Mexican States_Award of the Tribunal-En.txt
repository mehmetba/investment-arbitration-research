Ill. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On December 11, 2015, Lion submitted to the ICSID a RfA against Mexico pursuant
to Art. 36 of the ICSID Convention and on the basis of the NAFTA, between the United
States of America, Canada and the United Mexican States, which entered into force on
January 1, 1994. On December 23, 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered
the RfA and approved access to the Additional Facility pursuant to Art. 4 of the ICSID
AF Rules.

The Tribunal was constituted on July 27, 2016, in accordance with Art. 6(3) of the
ICSID AF Rules and was originally composed of Juan Fernandez-Armesto a national
of Spain, President, appointed by the Secretary-General pursuant to agreement of the
Parties; David J.A. Cairns, a national of Great Britain and New Zealand, appointed by
the Claimant; and Ricardo Ramirez Hernandez, a national of Mexico, appointed by the
Respondent. The Tribunal was reconstituted on February 6, 2018, with the appointment
of Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, following the resignation of Ricardo Ramirez
Hernandez.

In the course of the proceeding, the Tribunal issued a Decision on the Respondent’s
Preliminary Objection under Art. 45(6) of the ICSID AF Rules, dated December 12,
2016, a Decision on the Non-Disputing Party’s Application, dated May 23, 2017, a
Decision on Bifurcation, dated May 29, 2017, and a Decision on Jurisdiction, dated
July 30, 2018. The full procedural history of this case is described in these decisions.

The Decision on Jurisdiction forms part of this Award and is appended as Annex A. In
the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal dismissed Respondent’s jurisdictional
objection and declared that’:

- the Mortgages qualify as an investment, and
- the Notes do not qualify as an investment.

The procedural details of this proceeding following the Decision on Jurisdiction are
summarized below.

In accordance with section 17.1 of Procedural Order No. | [PO 1”], Mexico submitted
a document production schedule. Claimant filed its response and final version of the
document production schedule containing both Parties’ arguments, agreements and
disagreements and requests the Tribunal to decide on the production of documents.

IV. FACT:

This section describes the factual background of the dispute, which for the most part
remains undisputed between the Parties.

LION’S INVESTMENT IN MEXICO

Claimant, Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P., is a limited partnership constituted under
the laws of Quebec (Canada), with its main place of business in Texas (USA). Lion
was created and is managed by Clarion Partners, L.P. [“Clarion”], a real estate
investment management company founded in New York in 1982, which manages real
estate investments for institutional investors".

Lion had been making investments in Mexico for over ten years. Over that period, Lion
had provided more than US $800 million of capital to entities doing business in
Mexico, to be used in developing a wide array of real estate properties, such as hotels,
office buildings, residences, warehouses, and resorts'®. Wishing to develop further
investment opportunities in Mexico, Clarion engaged a specialized broker, and through
this channel Sr. Héctor Cardenas Curiel [‘Sr. Cardenas”], a Mexican businessman,
was introduced'®. Sr. Cardenas was presented as a developer seeking funding for the
development of two significant real estate projects: the “Nayarit Project” and the
“Guadalajara Project”.

SR. CARDENAS’S PROJECTS: NAYARIT AND GUADALAJARA

Mr. Hendricks, the managing director at Clarion during the period from 2006 through
2015, confirmed in his Witness Statement that Sr. Cardenas enjoyed the reputation of
a “trusted business partner of respected developers'””. However, the preliminary
inquiries did not extend to Cardenas’s father-in-law, a Sr. Garsin, a person with a “big
banking relationship at Bansi Bank!*” and apparently a powerful figure in the State of
Jalisco, who also became involved in the project.

The Nayarit Project included an ocean-front residential and resort development in
Bahia de Banderas, State of Nayarit'®. The development plan called for a mixed-use
high-end resort to be anchored by a Ritz Carlton hotel, 1,500 luxury residential units,

extensive amenity offerings, and two ocean-front golf courses, to be developed on 855
hectares (2,100 acres) with 2.8 miles of ocean frontage”.

The Guadalajara Project”! consisted of two high-end mixed-use skyscrapers, to be built
on approximately 15,000 m? (3.74 acre) in the city of Guadalajara, State of Jalisco’.

Sr. Cardenas’s plans for the development of the Nayarit and the Guadalajara Projects
were preliminary and incomplete at the time he requested capital from Lion to acquire
land and begin limited infrastructure development”. Lion was willing to provide
capital for the development of these projects subject to certain requirements, accepted
by Sr. Cardenas, including the following:

- The granting of mortgages to Lion over the land acquired by Sr. Cardenas and on
the subsequent improvements made on that land”; and

- The issuance of promissory notes as unconditional commitments to repay the
money owed to Lion, with certain procedural privileges under Mexican law.

1.2. THE THREE SETS OF TRANSACTIONS

62.

63.

64.

In February, June and September 2007, Lion made three loans for financing the
purchase of the properties for the Nayarit Project and the Guadalajara Project [the
“Loans”], as well as working capital.

A. The first set of transactions

The first loan took the form of a “Credit Agreement” between Lion (as Lender),
Inmobiliaria Bains, S.A. de C.V. [“Inmobiliaria Bains”] (as Borrower) and C&C
Ingenieria, S.A. de C.V. [“C&C Ingenieria”] as joint and several obligor —
Inmobiliaria Bains and C&C Ingenieria were two companies owned by Cardenas. The
first loan was signed on February 28, 2007 and had a term of 18 months. Its original
due date was August 28, 2008. The loan was for the amount of US $15,000,000, which
accrued ordinary interest at a rate of 18% per year, capitalized every three months, and
in the event of a default, a default interest rate of 25% [the “First Loan”]°°.

The Credit Agreement was written in English and governed by the laws of Mexico’.

65. The contract provided for the granting of a mortgage (clause four) and the issue of a
non-negotiable promissory note (clause two, 2.2(5)) to secure the loan. It enclosed an
Exhibit A (with the “Form of Mortgage”) and an Exhibit B (with the “Form of Note”).

The First Note

66. On the same day, Inmobiliaria Bains issued the first promissory note in favor of Lion
for US $15,000,000, plus ordinary interest at a rate of 18% per year, capitalized every
three months, and in the event of default, an interest rate of 25% [‘First Note].

67. The original maturity date of the First Note was August 28, 2008. The First Note was
substituted four times, resulting in a final maturity date as of September 30, 2009.

68. The First Note (as would the other two) was issued under Mexican law, drafted both in
English and Spanish (with the Spanish version governing) and submitted to the
exclusive and irrevocable jurisdiction of the courts of Mexico City.

The Nayarit Mortgage

69. About one year after the signing of the Credit Agreement, on April 2, 2008,
Inmobiliaria Bains granted in favor of Lion the “Nayarit Mortgage” over the Nayarit
Project property, located in the Municipality of Bahia de Banderas”?.

70. The Nayarit Mortgage was drafted in Spanish and subject to the laws of the State of
Nayarit*”. It was recorded at the Office of the Registro Piiblico de la Propiedad y de
Comercio (Public Registry) [Registro Publico”| of Bucerias, Nayarit, on May 19,
20087',

71. The Nayarit Mortgage in its final form would secure not just the First, but all three
Loans, including both principal and interest.

20; 2009; March 31, 2009; and July 7, 2009. The initial version of the First Note was signed in two separate
promissory notes for US$9,177,020.25 and US$5,822,979.75 (totaling US$15 million), respectively, with the
same original maturity date for both of them (August 28, 2008). All subsequent versions of the First Note were
issued in a single promissory note for US$15 million.

3! The Nayarit Mortgage replaced two previous mortgages in favor of Lion, which were subsequently cancelled:
a mortgage issued on February 28, 2007, and another on June 13, 2007. While on February 28, 2007, the

beneficiary of the trust, in favor of Lion, over one of the properties pertaining to the
Guadalajara Project*!.

The Guadalajara Mortgage 2 was subject to the law of Jalisco and was recorded at the
Registro Publico of that State on December 6, 2007.

THE DEFAULTS

None of the initial deadlines for the repayment of any of the three Loans were met. Sr.
Cardenas requested and obtained a series of time extensions: from March 2008 through
July 2009 Lion signed maturity date extensions on the First Loan four times*”, on the
Second Loan seven times*?, and on the Third Loan six times**.

The last payment date on the three transactions was, ultimately, September 30, 2009,
and the debtors failed to satisfy the outstanding amounts by that date. All three Loans
were declared in default and interest at the default rate began to accrue on
October 1, 2009.

Lion sent its first invoice to Sr. Cardenas for the outstanding principal and interest
payments due on April 16, 2010*°. The amounts due on that invoice, calculated and
dated as of March 31, 2010, totaled US $26,618,972 for the Nayarit Project and
US $29,649,835 for the Guadalajara Project.

Subsequent invoices were sent on July 14, 2010*; October 11, 2010*7; February 14,
201148; April 12, 2011*?, and July 29, 2011°°. The amounts due on the latest invoices
sent, calculated and dated as of June 30, 2011, were US $36,041,328.45 for the Nayarit
Project and US $40,065,210.38 for the Guadalajara Project*!.

According to Lion, no payments were ever made.

THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN LION AND SR. CARDENAS

Lion initiated negotiations and held meetings with Sr. Cardenas, trying to find an
amicable solution to the breach and to avoid initiating formal foreclosure

proceedings**. Between September and December 2011 Lion and a representative of
Cardenas discussed the restructuring of the debt according to a term sheet. Such
proposal never contemplated the cancellation of the Mortgages, nor the possibility that
Lion become a shareholder in Cardenas’s companies*». A restructuring term sheet was
eventually signed by Sr. Cardenas in October 2011 on behalf of the borrowers under
the three Loan Agreements [the “Debtors”], but was not accepted by Lion, as it did not
adhere to all the requirements advocated by Lion in the negotiations**.

The discussions continued until February 2012, without Lion and Sr. Cardenas
reaching an agreement**. On February 17, 2012 Lion took a first step towards the
enforcement of the Mortgages: it served the Debtors with a formal request demanding
payment of the amounts owed plus interest, under penalty of initiating foreclosure

actions*°,

THE CANCELLATION LAWSUIT

On March 13, 2012, unbeknown to Lion, which was still engaged in bona fide
negotiations with Sr. Cardenas*’, the Debtors filed a fraudulent lawsuit [the
“Cancellation Lawsuit”, the proceeding will be referred to as the “Cancellation
Proceeding”] against Lion before the Juez Noveno de lo Mercantil of the State of
Jalisco [the “Juez de lo Mercantil”).

Under the applicable State laws, mortgages registered in the Registro Publico can be
cancelled through a judgement issued by a competent judge**. The Cancellation
Lawsuit was the first step in a complex judicial fraud schemed by Sr. Cardenas to avoid
the imminent foreclosure of the Mortgages. It is clear that Sr. Cardenas organised this
fraudulent scheme because:

- He was the person who controlled the Debtors and the beneficiary of the
cancellation of the Mortgages;

- The fraud purported to transfer jurisdiction over the Mortgages from the Courts
of Mexico DF to the Courts of Jalisco, precisely where Sr. Cardenas resided and
was well-established;

- The scheme required the designation of a false address for the service of Lion,
and the collaboration of a person at the false address; this role was fulfilled by a

lawyer called Lic. José Isaac Lopez Medina, who appeared to be an associate of
Sr. Cardenas;

- The fraudulent scheme eventually required the impersonation of a representative
of Lion (Sr. José Javier Tovar Arechederra). This was achieved using a copy of
Sr. Arechederra’s driving licence on the same date that the driving licence was
deposited with security at the venue of the meeting organized by Sr. Cardenas;

- The Tribunal finally notes that Mexico, while refusing to outright admit that
fraud had indeed been perpetrated by the Debtors, argues that the “alleged multi-
level fraud” was so complex and sophisticated that its judicial system could not
withstand it.

The objective of the first part of Sr. Cardenas’s fraudulent scheme was to obtain a
judgement, register it in the Registros Publicos, and thus legally extinguish the
Mortgages, making any foreclosure impossible. The second part of the fraudulent
scheme was then to preclude any possibility for Lion to file an amparo procedure,
which would have rectified the previous cancellation of the mortgages. The fraudulent
scheme required an impressive knowledge of the intricacies of the Mexican procedural
system, suggesting that Sr. Cardenas was assisted by an experienced legal mastermind.

JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT OF THE (FALSE) TERMINOS

As a first step, the Debtors approached their local Juez de lo Mercantil in Jalisco and
requested judicial enforcement of a settlement contract, presented only in the form of
a photocopy, titled “Términos para pago de los contratos de crédito” [the “Términos”]
and allegedly executed four months before, on November 14, 2011, between Lion and
the Debtors®.

The Debtors’ prayer for relief in the Cancellation Lawsuit reads as follows:
“PRESTACIONES

A) Por la DECLARACION JUDICIAL que se haga por parte de su Sefioria en el
sentido de que la demandada "LION MEXICO CONSOLIDATED, L.P." esta
obligada al CUMPLIMIENTO CABAL de todas las obligaciones que asumio y

que dimanan_a_su_cargo del documento base de _la_accién que las partes
i "TERMINOS__PARA PAGO DE LOS CONTRATOS DE

CREDITO"” [Emphasis added]

The Debtors were thus seeking a judicial order granting specific enforcement of the
obligations purportedly assumed by Lion in the Términos: under what seemed to be the
terms of this agreement, Lion had accepted the cancellation of all pending debts against

°° RR, para. 230.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

the Debtors, the cancellation of the Mortgages securing such debt in the Registro
Publico, and the return of the Notes to the Debtors, and in exchange the Debtors had
undertaken to issue and to deliver to Lion a participation in Sr. Cardenas’s companies*'.

99. The Debtors now alleged that Lion had defaulted on the obligations assumed in the
Términos and requested the Juez de lo Mercantil to order specific performance,
resulting in the cancellation of the Mortgages in the Registro Publico.

100. The Términos included two further important elements of legal engineering:

101. First, the Términos purported to contain a clause awarding jurisdiction to the Courts of
Jalisco. While all the Promissory Notes attributed jurisdiction to the Courts of Mexico
City, far away from Sr. Cardenas’s main place of business, the Términos granted
jurisdiction to the Courts of Jalisco:

“8. Jurisdiccién y Competencia Para la interpretacion, cumplimiento y
ejecucién del presente convenio [...] las partes se someten [...] a los Tribunales
del Primer Partido Judicial del Estado de Jalisco, renunciando a cualquier otro
fuero o jurisdiccién que por razon de convenio previo o domicilio actual o futuro
pudiese corresponderles”.

102. Second, the Términos included an address for service of process in Jalisco and the name
of a process agent. While the Loans provided 3141 Hood Street, Suite 700 Dallas,
Texas 75219® as Lion’s address, with a copy to an address in Mexico at Paseo de los
Tamarindos 400-B, Piso 8, Bosque de las Lomas, 05120 Mexico, D.F.°*, oddly the
Términos identified a Jalisco lawyer® and an address in Jalisco:

“7, Domicilio para recibir notificaciones y autorizados [Lion] sefiala como
domicilio para recibir cualquier tipo de comunicaci6n relativa a la presente
propuesta y notificaciones el de la finca marcada con el nimero 95 Despacho 7
de la calle Tomas V. Gomez, Colonia Ladron de Guevara, en el municipio de
Guadalajara, Jalisco y como autorizados para recibirlas y acusar recibo de las
mismas a los Licenciados Emilio Gonzalez de Castilla del Valle y Jose Isaac
Lopez Medina”.

in Mexico to enumerate persons authorized to receive communications by name, rather than referring to
addresses only, see HT, pp. 546-547. In this case, the Términos provide the name of a well-known México DF
lawyer (Gonzalez de Castilla), who did not participate in the scheme, and whose name was inserted to give
credibility to the clause, and of a Jalisco lawyer (Lopez Medina), who actually received the notifications, never
informed Lion of such fact and who seems to have acted as Cardenas

4.2. THE TERMINOS DOCUMENT IS A FORGERY

103. The Tribunal is convinced that the Términos are in fact a forgery [and will refer to the
document frequently as the “Forged Settlement Agreement” or “Forged
Agreement”). In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal finds the following evidence
compelling:

- The Forged Agreement purports to have been signed by Lion’s legal
representative in Mexico, Mr. James Christian Hendricks®’; Mr. Hendricks
appeared as a witness in this procedure, and gave sworn evidence that he never
signed the document and that the signature appended to the document (shown
below) is false°*;

 

- Lic. Gonzalez de Castilla, the other lawyer allegedly designated by Lion as a
person authorized to receive notifications in the Términos, and a well-known and
highly respected professional, has declared in the presence of a Public Notary
that: (i) he was not authorized by Lion or by any other company to receive any
notification in Guadalajara; (ii) he did not know the said address nor the other
person allegedly authorized; and (iii) he had no professional dealings in
Guadalajara”;

- Since the very moment that Lion obtained knowledge of the existence of the
Forged Agreement in mid-December 2012”, it has consistently averred that the
document is a forgery; Lion has repeated the averment in this procedure”!;

Award

- Lion has repeatedly tried to obtain a declaration from the Mexican civil Courts,
confirming the forgery of the Términos”; although the Mexican civil Courts have
never rendered a judgement confirming the existence of forgery, Claimant says
that such refusal is improper and tainted by denial of justice;

- Upon gaining knowledge of the Términos, Lion initiated criminal actions against
Sr. Cardenas”, some of which were ongoing at the time of the filing of Post-
Hearing Briefs”.

- The Forged Agreement purports to formalize a settlement, in which Lion agrees
to cancel the Loans, the Notes and the Mortgages in exchange for a participation
in Sr. Cardenas’s companies; there is no contemporary evidence proving that in
the negotiations between Lion and Sr. Cardenas such solution was ever
discussed; to the contrary, the evidentiary record shows that Lion’s intention
during the negotiation was to obtain repayment of the Loans, and if the
negotiation failed, to foreclose on the Mortgages”;

 

- It is unlikely that Lion, a well advised Canadian company, which had insisted
that in its previous agreements with Sr. Cardenas and his companies jurisdiction
should lie with the Courts of Mexico City, would accept that the Términos, the
settlement agreement finalizing the relationship, be subject to the jurisdiction of
the Courts of Jalisco; it is even more unlikely that Lion additionally would have
consented to designate an obscure lawyer in Jalisco, related to Cardenas, and with
whom Lion had never had relations, as its process agent, authorized to receive all
types of notifications;

- There is a final argument: confronted with Claimant’s averment in the present
arbitration that the Forged Settlement indeed is a forgery, Mexico has failed to
dispute this statement”°.

4.3. EMPLAZAMIENTO AND DECLARATION EN REBELDIA

104. Two weeks after the filing of the Cancellation Lawsuit, on April 3, 2012 the actuario
(a court officer of the Juez de lo Mercantil) attempted a first service of process [the
“emplazamiento”| at the address identified in clause 7 of the Forged Settlement
Agreement. The service attempt was done on Lic. José Isaac Lopez Medina’, one of

an

Confronted by the actuario, Lic. Lopez Medina formally declared that no legal
representative of Lion was present in his office in order to receive the emplazamiento.
Upon receipt of this representation, the actuario withdrew, announcing that he would
return the next day.

106. At the second visit, which occurred next day, the actuario decided to make the
emplazamiento against Lion through a notificacién por cédula delivered to the person
who was at the address, Lic. Lopez Medina”.

107. Lic. Lopez Medina accepted the emplazamiento and received a copy of the judicial file
(“autos”).

108. Being unaware that a Court procedure against it was pending before the Juez de lo
Mercantil of Jalisco, Lion inevitably failed to appear within the statutory time-limit.

109. The consequence of this failure was that six weeks thereafter, on May 22, 2012, Lion
was declared en rebeldia by the Juez de lo Mercantil through notification via boletin
judicial® (a judicial bulletin)*!.

110. Two weeks after the declaration en rebeldia, on June 6, 2012 the Debtors submitted
their evidence before the Juez de lo Mercantil, including the Mortgage deeds and
Minutes of the General Shareholders Meeting of C&C Capital. All the evidence
marshalled by the Debtors was admitted six days later, on June 12, 2012°.

4.4 THE JUDGMENT OF THE JUEZ DE LO MERCANTIL

111.

Just two weeks after the submission of evidence, on June 27, 2012 the Juez de lo
Mercantil, acting solely on the basis of the evidence marshalled by the Debtors, and
without any participation of Lion, declared the Loans settled and ordered Lion to cancel
the Mortgages and return the Notes [the “Cancellation Judgment”]**. From the filing
of the Cancellation Lawsuit to the rendering of the Cancellation Judgment, only 170
days had lapsed.

therein. This is not disputed by Mexico.

The Cancellation Judgement causa estado

A few days thereafter, on August 8, 2012, and at the request of the Debtors, the Juez
de lo Mercantil, declared that the Cancellation Judgement “causa estado por ministerio
de la ley”, i.e. that it has become res iudicata, there being no possibility of submitting
a recurso de apelacion. The reason given by the Judge for his decision precluding any
further appeal was that the amount claimed in the procedure was less than MEX
500,000 (approximately USD 25,000)**.

The decision is difficult to understand, because the principal amount of the Loans
settled and Mortgages terminated amounted to tens of millions of dollars. Be that as it
may, the decision was highly relevant, because it deprived Lion of any possibility of
launching an ordinary appeal against the Cancellation Judgement.

The Cancellation Judgement is enforced

In a subsequent procedural decision, the Juez de lo Mercantil gave Lion a peremptory
term of three days to voluntarily comply with the Cancellation Judgement*?. Lion, who
was still unaware of the Cancellation Proceeding, failed to comply and on August 30,
2012 the Juez de lo Mercantil ordered the Registro Publico of Jalisco to cancel the
Guadalajara Mortgages*® and that of Nayarit to do the same with the Nayarit
Mortgage®’.

The Registro Ptiblico of Jalisco did so on September 7, 2012°*. The cancellation of the
Nayarit Mortgage was recorded on October 19, 2012°°. Upon these registrations, all
three Mortgages became extinct for all legal purposes.

FALSE AMPARO PROCEEDINGS

The Debtors’ scheme did not end here.

Having orchestrated the cancellation of the Mortgages, the Debtors wanted to ensure
that Lion, upon being appraised of the Cancellation Judgment, would encounter

considerable procedural obstacles in seeking to reverse such decision.

Cancellation Judgement, the Juez de lo Mercantil having decided, upon the request of

the Debtors, that the amount in dispute was less than MEX 500,000 and that as a
consequence thereof the respondent was not entitled to appeal.

The Debtors, well advised on the intricacies of the Mexican procedural system, were
aware that the other viable avenue for reversal of the Cancellation Judgment required
Lion to initiate an Amparo procedure. As explained by Claimant’s legal expert, a juicio
de Amparo is a general challenge procedure governed by the Ley de Amparo, which
seeks to revert violations of human rights as afforded to citizens and aliens under
Mexico’s Constitution’.

The Debtors developed a further fraudulent scheme to disrupt the eventual Amparo to
be filed in due course by Lion. The scheme would develop in two stages, which were
to occur before Lion became aware of the Cancellation Judgment (and filed a real
Amparo):

- in the first stage, a person falsely alleging to be a legal representative of Lion
would present a request for Amparo purporting to act on behalf of Lion; and

- in the second, that person would abandon the Amparo.

The purpose of this scheme was to prevent Lion, when it eventually obtained
knowledge of what had happened, from presenting a proper Amparo: Att. 73 of the Ley
de Amparo provides a list of eighteen causes for the finding of inadmissibility of an
Amparo, including when an Amparo is based on the same facts as a previously
abandoned one®!. Under this rule, Lion’s proper Amparo would be inadmissible,
because a previous Amparo relating to the same facts, had already been submitted and
then abandoned. To revert this inadmissibility finding, Lion would have to prove that
the person who had submitted and then abandoned the False Amparo, purporting to be
a representative of Lion, was in fact not authorized by Lion to act on its behalf — an
endeavour fraught with difficulties which in the actual facts proved impossible.

In order to file an Amparo falsely in the name of Lion, the Debtors needed to gain
access to a copy of the case file, which in turn could only be obtained by a person
holding a power of attorney. Sr. Cardenas knew from the documents which
accompanied one of Lion’s requests for payment, that a certain Sr. José Javier Tovar
Arechederra was one of Lion’s representatives in Mexico. All that was needed was to
impersonate Sr. Arechederra.

THE IMPERSONATION OF SR. ARECHEDERRA.

On the same day when the Cancellation Judgment was issued, someone impersonating
Mr. Arechederra went to a Notary in Jalisco to obtain a copy of the power of attorney
granted to the real Mr. Arechederra”?.

[Two years later this Notary Public would be arrested on charges of fraud and
forgery of documents, subsequently fined and suspended as a Notary Public and
eventually permanently disbarred by the State of Jalisco”*]

The plan was not yet fully completed. Sr. Cardenas still required a document
confirming the impostor’s identity as Sr. Arechederra. On July 6, 2012, Sr. Cardenas
summoned the real Sr. Arechederra to a meeting in Jalisco (the city where the Juez de lo
Mercantil is located)**. Sr. Arechederra left his driver’s license at the security control of
the building where the meeting took place”.

On the same day, July 6, 2012, an impostor using the same driver’s license”® to identify
himself as Sr. Arechederra, filed with the Juez de lo Mercantil a request for a certified
copy of the entire case file’’, on behalf of Lion, exhibiting the power of attorney
obtained from the Notary®®.

With the copy of the case file, on August 7, 2012 an Amparo against the Cancellation
Judgment, purportedly signed by Sr. Arechederra on behalf of Lion, was submitted at
the Jalisco Courts [the “False Amparo”]”.

THE FALSE AMPARO

The Tribunal is convinced that Sr. Arechederra never actually signed the False Amparo
on behalf of Lion. In coming to this conclusion, the Tribunal finds the following
evidence compelling:

- Sr. Arechederra corroborated by his sworn testimony at the Hearing that he never

carried out any of the above actions'”°;

[The possibility of amending this procedural deficiency is noteworthy, as it
contrasts with the treatment given to the real Lion, when it filed the proper
Amparo: it was never granted an opportunity to cure an alleged defect in the power
of attorney of the person signing an ampliacién de demanda.]

The very purpose of the False Amparo was to be filed and then to be abandoned.
Consequently, no copies were ever delivered, and the procedural deficiency was never
corrected. Consequently, on August 17, 2012, the Juez dismissed the False Amparo'®*
and on September 6, 2012 declared this decision to be final and not subject to appeal!™.

The effects came to haunt Lion when it eventually filed the proper Amparo.

LION FORECLOSES ON THE (SOON TO BE CANCELLED) NAYARIT MORTGAGE

In the meantime, Lion was still unaware that the Debtors had filed the Cancellation
Lawsuit in the local Courts of Jalisco, seeking enforcement of a Forged Settlement
Agreement, that the emplazamiento had been delivered to an obscure lawyer in Jalisco,
that Lion had been declared en rebeldia and that the Cancellation Judgement had been
rendered in favour of the Debtors, cancelling the outstanding Loans and Mortgages.

Lion continued its bona fide negotiations with Cardenas, but in view of the persistence
of the default, on April 3, 2012 Lion finally decided to foreclose, but only on one of
the three Mortgages: it initiated a juicio especial hipotecario [the “Juicio
Hipotecario”|''° before the Juez Trigésimo Noveno de lo Civil de México D.F. [the
“Juez de lo Civil”|'"', against the Debtors, seeking to enforce the Nayarit Mortgage.
Lion decided not to foreclose on the Guadalajara Mortgage, trying to minimize costs
and with the hope that filing one foreclosure proceeding would incentivize Sr. Cardenas
to pay the outstanding amounts!!”.

Difficulties in the emplazamiento

The attempts to notify the Juicio Hipotecario to the various Debtors commenced on
April 26, 2012, but it would take several years until all the mortgagors could be
properly served (emplazados)''*: Lion requested the Juez de lo Civil to serve

Nayarit; the courts of Jalisco and Nayarit — acting at the request of the Juez de lo Civil
— were unable to notify the company!'* and this situation prevented the Juicio
Hipotecario from progressing for more than three years!'>.

Anotacion preventiva

While Lion was trying to notify the Juicio Hipotecario to the Debtors, it requested and
obtained an order from the Juez de lo Civil in México D.F., instructing the Registro
Puiblico in Bucerias to make a preventive annotation in the books setting forth the
existence of a foreclosure procedure [the “Anotacién Preventiva”]. The Registrar did
so on May 3, 2012 and added that this Anotacién Preventiva would guarantee the
“inmovilidad registral” of the real estate, preventing any future annotation which could
disrupt the proper development of the Juicio Hipotecario''®:

“[L]o anterior para efectos de que dicha inscripcién sirva como inmovilidad
registral con la finalidad de que no se pueda verificarse (sic) en la finca
hipotecada_ ningtin embargo, toma de posesion, diligencia precautoria o
cualquier otra que entorpezca el curso del juicio”.

The Anotacion Preventiva was made on May 3, 2012, a month and a half before the
Cancellation Judgment (dated June 27, 2012), and in theory prevented any future
annotation which could disrupt the Juicio Hipotecario.

Notwithstanding this fact, upon rendering the Cancellation Judgement, the Juez de lo
Mercantil of Jalisco sent (through a local Court) an oficio to the Registro Ptblico de
Bucerias, requesting cancellation of the Mortgage (“solicito a Usted, cancele la
hipoteca”)''” The Registrar, disregarding the existence of the previous Anotacién
Preventiva, registered the cancellation of the Mortgage in the Registro Publico on
October 16, 2012, the security thus becoming null and void!'*:

Guadalajara Mortgages

Since Lion had chosen only to enforce the Nayarit Mortgage, but not the Guadalajara
Mortgage, no Anotacién Preventiva was ever issued in relation to the Guadalajara
Mortgages, and the security was cancelled, upon an oficio of the Juez de lo Mercantil
of Jalisco of August 30, 2012!1°.

LION’S ATTEMPTS TO REMEDY THE CANCELLATION OF THE MORTGAGES

In mid-December 2012 Lion was astonished to learn, through informal sources, of the
cancellation of the Mortgages!”°.

Lion immediately turned to trying to undo the cancellation.

Mexican procedural law allows for the institution of Amparo proceedings to overturn
judicial decisions. There are two different types of Amparo procedures: Amparo directo
and Amparo indirecto. The Amparo directo is most commonly filed against final
judgments, and the Amparo indirecto against certain procedural orders, or against
actions taken after the case ends or against persons who did not participate in
proceedings!?!.

The Amparo claim has to be filed by the person affected by the act which is challenged
(known as the acto reclamado). Other parties to the Amparo procedure are

- the authorities who dictated, promulgated, published, ordered, executed or tried
to execute the acto reclamado (autoridades responsables), and

- the affected party’s counterparty in the procedure in which the challenged action
was issued or executed (known as the tercero perjudicado)'*.

LION FILES AN AMPARO INDIRECTO

On December 18, 2012 Lion filed an Amparo indirecto lawsuit!” (“Real Amparo”,
also “Amparo claim” and “Amparo lawsuit” (as opposed to the previous False
Amparo)] before the Juez de Distrito en Materia Civil in Jalisco [“Juez de Distrito”).

The claim was brought against the Juez de lo Mercantil, against his Secretary and
against the officers responsible for the Registros Ptiblicos of Nayarit and Bucerias'**.
The Debtors were designated in the Amparo claim as terceros perjudicados (aggrieved
third parties)!?>.

The actos reclamados included, among others, the lack of proper notification of Lion
in the Cancellation Lawsuit:

“La falta de emplazamiento al quejoso y todas y cada una de las actuaciones y
resoluciones relativas al juicio Ordinario Mercantil radicado ante el Juzgado
Mercantil del Primer Partido Judicial del Estado de Jalisco”’”®.

ATTEMPTS TO CLAIM FORGERY

Initially, Lion started the Amparo indirecto to obtain declaratory relief that it had never
been properly served by the Juez de lo Mercantil. It did not include any reference to
the Forged Settlement Agreement, because the specific content of the Forged
Agreement only became known to Lion when the Juez de lo Mercantil filed an informe
as part of the Amparo proceeding '?’.

The ampliacién de demanda

Upon receiving this information, on January 28, 2013 Lion filed an ampliacién de la
demanda (extension request) of the Amparo lawsuit, explaining that the service made
by the Juez de lo Mercantil was based on a forged document and should thus be deemed
inexistent!?*:

“La falta de emplazamiento legal a la hoy quejosa [i.e. Lion] [...] debido a que

- a graphological expert report to prove that the signature in the Forged Agreement
did not belong to Mr. Hendricks, and

- emails between a broker retained by Lion and Sr. Cardenas to demonstrate that,
after the Forged Agreement was supposedly signed in November 2011, Lion and
Cardenas were still holding discussions on the terms of the repayment of the
Loans.

oo

By proveido (procedural decision) of January 30, 2013 [the “Dismissal Proveido”] the
Secretario del Juzgado de Distrito [i.e. the clerk of the Juez de Distrito] in Jalisco
dismissed the ampliacion of the Amparo submitted by Lion, arguing that!*°

“dichos actos ya fueron precisados desde el escrito inicial de demanda”.

149.

©

Frustrated by this postponement, Lion brought, on February 6, 2013, an “incidente de
falsedad de documento” before the Juez de Distrito, claiming again that the Forged
Agreement was the result of fraud!?!.

150.

So

On April 10, 2013, the Juez de Distrito stated that he would decide in due course on
the admissibility of the proposed graphological expertise on the authenticity of the
Forged Settlement Agreement!*?. And on April 19, 2013, the Juez de Distrito once
again decided to postpone his decision on the admissibility of the evidence, because of
a queja proceeding which was subsequently initiated and which will be dealt with in
the next section!*>.

7.3. THE DISMISSAL OF EVIDENCE ON THE FORGERY

151.

While the decision on the admission of evidence was pending before the Juez de
Distrito, one of the Debtors, C&C Ingenieria, filed as a tercero perjudicado two
quejas'*4 before the Segundo Tribunal Colegiado en Materia Civil del Tercer Circuito

'34 The orders and judgments issued in Amparo proceedings are themselves subject to three different challenges:
revision, queja and reclamacién. In an Amparo indirecto, such as the one file by Lion, the most common
challenges are queja against different procedural orders (specifically those that cause irreparable harm) and
revision against the Juez de Distrito’s final judgment, both of which are decided by a Tribunal Colegiado de
Circuito, referred to as Tribunal de Queja, see Zamora |, para. 87.

Award

[the “Tribunal de Queja”] against the Dismissal Proveido issued by the Secretary of
the Court!*5 and the April 10, 2013 decision of the Juez de Distrito'*°. C&C Ingenieria
argued that Lion’s ampliacién de demanda was inadmissible, because it had not been
properly signed on Lion’s behalf.

152. Lion for its part also submitted a queja against the same decision, because it precluded
Lion from claiming that the Forged Settlement Agreement was a forgery and the origin
of the improper service'*’.

153. The Tribunal de Queja dismissed Lion’s queja and sided with C&C Ingenieria: the
appeal court ruled that the ampliacién de la demanda, which Lion had filed, was
inadmissible, because it had not been properly signed on behalf of Lion: it should have
been signed by Lion’s legal representative and not by the attorney empowered by Lion
to act on its behalf in the Amparo proceedings!**.

154. Lion was not given an opportunity to cure the alleged procedural defect, although the
ampliacién de demanda aimed at proving that Lion, an alien company operating in
Mexico, had been the victim of an elaborate fraud to avoid its proper emplazamiento.

[This stands in stark contrast with the treatment granted to the complainants when
the False Amparo was submitted without the requisite copies. In that instance, the
Juez accorded the complainants the chance to cure the formalistic deficiency.]

The decisions of the Juez de Distrito

155. Once the queja had been resolved, the Juez de Distrito resumed his work, and in
accordance with the decision of the Tribunal de Queja resolved that all evidence linked
to the forgery claim should be dismissed (both the evidence already admitted and the
evidence still pending admission)!*?.

156. Thereafter the Juez de Distrito rendered a specific ruling on Lion’s separate motion
(“incidente de falsedad de documento”). The judge dismissed it on the grounds that the
allegedly false document (the Forged Settlement Agreement) was not related to the
subject-matter of the Amparo Proceeding'*°.

Forgery is excluded from the scope of the Amparo

Be that as it may, from that date on, the scope of the Amparo did not include any inquiry
into the issue whether the Settlement Agreement had been forged; it was assumed that
the Settlement Agreement was valid and binding, having been properly executed by
Lion. The scope of the Amparo was reduced to the question whether the emplazamiento
had or not been properly executed in accordance with Mexican law. And — congruently
with this reduced scope of investigation — all evidence in the file seeking to prove the
forgery of the Settlement Agreement was expurgated.

THE AMPARO JUDGMENT

On December 4, 2013, the Juez de Distrito delivered his decision denying Lion
protection against the Cancellation Judgment [the “Amparo Judgment”]'*'.

“[...] RES UEL VE: UNICO. LA JUSTICIA DE LA UNION NO AMPARA
NI PROTEGE A LION MEXICO CONSOLIDATED, L.P., contra los actos que
reclama del JUEZ Y DEL SECRETARIO EJECUTOR, AMBOS ADSCRITOS
AL JUZGADO NOVENO DE LO MERCANTIL DEL PRIMER PARTIDO
JUDICIAL DEL ESTADO DE JALISCO. [...]” [Capitals in the original]

The Amparo Judgement is a 67-page document, which in its “Resu/tando” summarizes
the procedure, and which then reasons the decision in seven “Considerandos”.

Sr. Arechederra’s signature had been forged

As a preliminary question, the Juez de Distrito analyzes Lion’s allegation that on July
6, 2012 Sr. Arechederra’s signature had been forged in the false request for copy before
the Juzgado de lo Mercantil — see section 5.1. supra. (The issue was relevant, because
if it had been true that on July 6, 2012 Lion had been aware of the Cancellation
Judgement, the Amparo would have been inadmissible due to the statute of limitations).

The Amparo Judgement, after weighing the expert evidence marshalled by the parties,
concludes that Sr. Arechederra’s signature indeed had been forged, that the request for
copy had indeed been false, and that consequently Lion’s request for Amparo was not
time barred'*”,

Sr. Cardenas is in prison

The Amparo Judgement also acknowledges that Sr. Arechederra and Lion had filed a
criminal action against Sr. Cardenas, accusing him of having forged his signature on
various documents, and that on September 26, 2013 the criminal judge had ordered the

Award

imprisonment of Sr. Cardenas for this crime. However, the Amparo Judge accorded

little weight to this piece of evidence!**.

No discussion of forgery of the Settlement Agreement

Notwithstanding the finding that at least on one occasion Sr. Arechederra’s signature
had been forged, and that Sr. Cardenas was in prison for alleged forgeries of
documents, the Amparo judgement does not even discuss Lion’s argument that the
Settlement Agreement might also have been forged: since the ampliacion de demanda
had been dismissed (because it had been signed by Lion’s attorney, but not by a legal
representative), any issue relating to the falsehood of the Settlement Agreement was
off limits in the Amparo procedure.

The Amparo Judgement consequently assumes that the Settlement Agreement was
validly executed on Lion’s behalf. There being a valid Settlement Agreement with a
designation of process agent and an address for service of process, the Juez de Distrito
dismisses Lion’s argument that the emplazamiento should have been made in Dallas,
Texas, USA, and in accordance with the applicable international treaties!

Instead, the Juez de Distrito discusses at length a minor incident in the way the
fraudulent emplazamiento had taken place: in accordance with the Settlement
Agreement the notification should have been made at Calle Tomas V. Gomez 95,
despacho 7. But in reality, the actuario went to the same address, but to a different
office: despacho 5.

The Juez de Distrito finds that this “minor defect” does not invalidate the
emplazamiento, because the actuario was able to locate Lic. Lopez Medina, who, in
accordance with the Settlement Agreement, was the person designated by Lion as
process agent!#,

THE RECURSO DE REVISION

Lion was not satisfied with the Amparo Judgement. On December 19, 2013 Lion filed
a recurso de revision [the “Recurso de Revision’), seeking its revocation, the granting
of protection to Lion’s constitutional rights and the finding that the Cancellation
Lawsuit and related acts were null and void'*°.

Among other reasons, Lion explicitly challenged the Amparo Judgment, arguing that
the Juez de Distrito had disregarded Lion’s claim that the Settlement Agreement had
been forged, using the argument that the falsehood was unrelated to the dispute and

that the defendants in the Amparo had not participated in the alleged forgery. Lion
explained that the falsehood of the Settlement Agreement was indeed relevant for the
Amparo, because Lion’s emplazamiento had been delivered to Lic. Lopez Medina,
Lion’s purported process agent designated in the Settlement Agreement. If the
Settlement Agreement was a forgery, the designation of Lic. Lopez Medina was false,
and the emplazamiento had not been properly made!4’.

At first, the Recurso de Revision was assigned to the Cuarto Tribunal Colegiado en
Materia Civil del Tercer Circuito'**, However, it was later decided that the Recurso de
Revision should instead be heard by the same court that had rejected Lion’s earlier
queja regarding the decision sobre la ampliacion (the Segundo Tribunal del Tercer
Circuito, referred to in this Award as “Tribunal de Queja”)'”.

The False Amparo surfaces

Up to this point, Claimant had undertaken at least four formal attempts requesting that
it be authorized to allege in the Amparo that the Settlement Agreement was indeed a
forgery, and to marshal evidence proving this allegation. Yet the Tribunal de Queja,
once again, decided not to investigate the issue of forgery nor to admit any evidence to
prove it — but this time for a different reason.

More than 16 months after the initiation of the Recurso de Revision, on April 17, 2015,
the Tribunal de Queja surprisingly decided to remand the case back to the Juez de
Distrito for a totally different purpose: to determine whether Lion’s Amparo
proceeding was inadmissible, a different Amparo relating to the same facts having been
filed at an earlier date and thereafter abandoned.

Pro memoria: the False Amparo had been fraudulently filed and then abandoned by
someone impersonating Sr. Arechederra, Lion’s representative in Mexico — with the
purpose of obstructing the real Amparo which Lion was expected to submit in due
course.

When the Tribunal de Queja raised the issue of the False Amparo it came as a total
surprise:

- For the last 16 months of Amparo proceeding no party and no prior court had
ever referred to this admissibility issue'*°;

447 Exh, C-116, pp. 16-17.

448 CM, para. 155.

150 Exh, C119.

53

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

- The same Tribunal de Queja had also failed to raise the issue when it first
intervened in these proceedings, to adjudicate the appeal against interlocutory
decisions of the Juez de Distrito;

- The Tribunal de Queja decided sua sponte, and over a year into the recurso de
revision, to raise the existence of the False Amparo; the only reason given by the
Tribunal de Queja to justify its decision was that an unidentified administrative
official had informed the Court of the existence of the previous Amparo'*'.

174. As regards the remand procedure, the Tribunal de Queja ordered that it should be
restricted to adjudicating the admissibility issue, explicitly prohibiting the parties to
marshal new evidence regarding the falsehood of the Settlement Agreement!*? and
instructing the Juez de Distrito not to analyze Lion’s allegation that such Agreement
had been forged!>?.

175. After three years of judicial battling, Lion still had no decision confirming the
falsehood of the Forged Settlement Agreement and now it was fighting to prove that it
should not be deprived of Amparo recourse — the only way to overturn the wrongful
cancellation of the Mortgages.

7.6 THE REMAND AMPARO

176. The fact that Lion was being tried by the same judge who had already dismissed
evidence on the forgery did not discourage Lion from bringing once more a petition to
admit evidence on the fraudulent nature of the Forged Settlement Agreement'**. And,
since Lion had only acquired knowledge of the False Amparo’s existence at this point, it
also provided evidence pointing to the inauthenticity of the False Amparo!*.

177. On September 23, 2015 the Juez de Distrito only accepted the graphology expert report
and a brief filing on the False Amparo as evidence'®®. The Juez de Distrito used
formalistic reasoning to reject further evidence provided by Lion'*”.

courts trying to undo the fraudulent cancellation of the Mortgages. It had achieved very
little:

- Lion had filed an Amparo, but its recurring attempts that the scope of the
procedure be extended to cover the forgery of the Settlement Agreement (a fact
which Lion only learned after it had filed the Amparo) and that it be authorized
to marshal evidence proving the forgery, had been repeatedly dismissed by the
first instance Juez de Distrito and in second instance by the Tribunal de Queja,
for a purely formalistic reason: the ampliacion de la demanda had been signed
on behalf of Lion by its attorney and not by its legal representative - a minor
procedural defect Lion was never offered the opportunity to remedy;

- Unable to submit that the Settlement Agreement had been forged, Lion’s Amparo
had been dismissed by the first instance Juez de Distrito; in the Amparo
Judgement the Juez de Distrito assumed the Settlement Agreement to be valid
and binding and concluded that Lion’s emplazamiento had been properly served
on Lic. Lopez Medina, Lion’s process agent as identified in the Forged
Settlement Agreement — an obscure attorney, with whom Lion had never had any
relationship and who failed to inform Lion;

- On appeal against the Amparo Judgement, the second instance Tribunal de
Queja, whom Lion had asked to review a further time the prohibition to argue
the forgery issue, did not take up this question; instead the Tribunal de Queja, in
an unexpected move, made sua sponte the decision to remand the procedure back
to the first instance Judge, with a strictly limited remit: to review whether the
Amparo had been properly admitted, in light of the existence of a previous
Amparo (the False Amparo — a decoy procedure filed fraudulently by the Debtors
to derail the admissibility of the real Amparo);

- Upon the instructions of the Tribunal de Queja, the Juez de Distrito again denied
Lion’s request to expand the scope of the remand, so that the Amparo could

encompass the forgery of the Settlement Agreement.

179. On December 11, 2015 Lion waived the Amparo lawsuit. Lion says that it took this
decision, because it believed it was futile to continue:

- On the one hand, had Lion pursued the Remand Amparo, Mexico could have
argued in this arbitration that Lion’s expropriation claim under NAFTA Article 1110

55

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

would be inadmissible pursuant to NAFTA Article 1121(2), which sets a three-year
time limit to bring claims '**;

- On the other hand, the circumstances made it clear that further pursuit of Lion’s
claims, before the same court that had ruled against it before, on the basis on the
same evidence admitted previously, and barring admission of other relevant
evidence, was futile;

- Additionally, the graphological evidence that was in fact admitted, with the
experts opinions two-to-one in favour of the authenticity of the False Amparo,
made it even less likely that the Remand Amparo would make a ruling in favour
of Lion!*?,

8. CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND THE FATE OF THE NAYARIT PROPERTY

180. At the time of the filing of Post-Hearing Briefs, three criminal proceedings concerning
the alleged irregularities of which Lion says it has been a victim were pending
resolution:

- A criminal action'® had been brought against Sr. Cardenas in connection with
the Forged Settlement Agreement and the false request for copy; the investigation
phase had been completely exhausted; Sr. Cardenas, in his defense, had initiated
Amparos No. 610/2017 and No. 1518/2018; the criminal proceedings were halted
until those Amparos were resolved'*!;

- A criminal action'® had been brought against Sr. Cardenas concerning the False
Amparo; at the time of the filing of the Post-Hearing Briefs, this proceeding was
at the initial investigation phase, before the Prosecutor’s Office in Jalisco; the
Prosecutor was in the process of analyzing the matter to bring charges formally
(the “imputacion’”)'®;

- A criminal'™ action had been brought against Sr. Cardenas for the sale of the
Nayarit Property; at the time of the final Party submissions, the proceeding was
at the initial investigation phase, before the Prosecutor’s Office in Jalisco!®.

181. Other criminal proceedings initiated by Lion against Sr. Cardenas had already been
finalized at this point, with the Amparo Judgment stating that Sr. Cardenas was in jail

at the time of the rendering of the decision. Implicitly referring to the stature of Sr.
Cardenas’s father-in-law and the apparent leniency of Jalisco courts towards
Sr. Cardenas, Ms. Onay Payne (one of Lion’s representatives) stated at the Hearing that
they were able to “get him [Sr. Cardenas] behind bars”, but “not for long”!®°.

182. On July 27, 2016, Inmobiliaria Bains sold the Nayarit Property to “Hotelera los
Tules”'®’. This sale operation was recorded by the Registro Ptiblico of Bucerias on
May 16, 2017. In the course of one of the criminal proceedings against Sr. Cardenas,

184. Lion’s requests the following relief in its Post-Hearing Brie:
“The Claimant respectfully request the Tribunal:

a. To declare that Mexico has breached its obligations under Articles 1110 and
1105 of NAFTA and international law;

b. To order Mexico to pay the Claimant the amount of US$81,992,752 as
compensation for the loss caused by the cancellation of the Mortgages with
interest at the rate mentioned under (e) below;

c. To order Mexico to pay the Claimant the legal fees incurred in the Mexican
court proceedings in a minimum amount of US$2,212,004.53 as a result of the
cancellation of the Mortgages with interest at the rate mentioned under (e) below;
d. To order Mexico to pay the Claimant whatever amount is assessed against LMC
by the Mexican courts (currently valued at US$14,853,013.73) as a result of the
waiver of the Foreclosure Proceedings as per Article 1121 of NAFTA;

e. To order Mexico to pay interest on the amounts under (b) to (c) at the Mexican
Legal rate provided by Article 362 of the Mexican Commercial Code
compounded monthly (i.e., 6%), through the date of full and effective payment of
those amounts as from:

(i) 31 March 2015 for the lost value of the Mortgages;

(ii) 31 December 2015 to reimburse LMC for the attorney’s fees and costs it
incurred in Mexican court proceedings;

f. To order Mexico to reimburse Claimants all their reasonable legal costs and fees
in connection with this arbitration with interest as of the date of the award at the

interest rate mentioned above at (e); and

g. Any other remedies that the Tribunal consider appropriate in the circumstances
given Mexico’s breaches”

185. Mexico’s request for relief in its Rejoinder is as follows!”°:
“For all of the foregoing reasons, the Respondent requests:
e an Order dismissing the Claimant’s Claim in its entirety;

e an Order that the Claimant indemnify the Respondent for its costs
incurred in this arbitration, including its legal costs and the travel
expenses occurred by its legal team, witnesses, and experts; and

e such other relief as the Respondent may request and this Tribunal may

635. In the alternative, in the unlikely event that the Tribunal concludes that the
Respondent is internationally liable for a breach of its obligations under NAFTA.
Article 1110 and/or NAFTA Article 1105, the Respondent requests:

¢ that the amount of damages be determined on the basis of the CBRE
reports and Sanchez Devanny opinion, which put the value of the
property, net of foreclosure fees and expenses, at USD $47,060,068.57;

e minus the deduction that the Tribunal finds appropriate to avoid double
recovery and to account for the Claimant’s contributory fault;

e plus an award of interest based on a relatively low and risk-free rate
applicable to U.S. dollar denominated amounts, such as the U.S. Treasury
Bill with annual compounding; and

e any such other relief as the Respondent may request and this Tribunal
may deem appropriate”.
186. In its Post-Hearing Brief Respondent specified that!7!:

“[...] any damages found must be subject to a deduction for contributory fault
of at least 50% and closer to 100% since the Claimant would not have suffered
any losses had it not acted negligently and with a lack of due care”.

VI. MERI

 

187. Lion has brought this arbitration against Mexico to address Mexico’s alleged:

- judicial and administrative expropriation of Lion’s investment under NAFTA
‘Art. 1110!72;

- alternatively, Mexico’s denial of justice as a failure to provide fair and equitable
treatment under NAFTA Art. 1105, and

- alternatively, the failure to grant Lion’s investment full protection and security
under NAFTA Art. 1105.

General rule: No judicial expropriation without denial of justice

188. While expropriation constitutes Claimant’s primary claim'”*, the Tribunal observes
that liability for expropriation under Art. 1110 arising from the decisions of domestic
courts requires a finding of a denial of justice.

189. This is agreed upon by both of the Non-Disputing Parties in their submissions:
- The USA states that!”*:

“Decisions of domestic courts acting in the role of neutral and independent
arbiters of the legal rights of litigants do not give rise to a claim for expropriation
under Article 1110(1). Moreover, the United States has not recognized the concept
of “judicial takings” as a matter of domestic law [...].”

- Canada in turn asserts that!”>:

“A domestic court’s bona fide adjudication as to whether a property right exists
under domestic law cannot be recast as an expropriation of that property. A neutral
and independent judicial determination that a property right is invalid under
domestic law, unless it can be impugned as a denial of justice, does not give rise
to separate claim of expropriation under customary international law.
International tribunals have followed this approach.”

172 Claimant alleges that it suffered a judicial expropriation of the Mortgages through the Cancellation Judgment
which eventually also resulted in an administrative expropriation through the cancellation of the Mortgages in
the Public Registry (See CM, para. 260 and CPHB, para. 179 et seq...

"75 Canada Submission, para. 12.

60

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

190. This position is buttressed by the Loewen tribunal, which stated the following about a
judicial expropriation claim presented as an alternative to denial of justice!”®:

“Claimant’s reliance on Article 1110 adds nothing to the claim based on Article
1105. In the circumstances of this case, a claim alleging an appropriation in
violation of Article 1110 can succeed only if Loewen established a denial of
justice under 1105”.

191. A similar view has been expressed by legal scholars, inter alia, by Paparinskis, who in
his seminal treatise on the international minimum standard and fair and equitable
treatment has opined that

“[w]hile taking of property through the judicial process could be said to constitute
expropriation, the rules and criteria to be applied for establishing the breach
should come from denial of justice”'””.

Exceptions to the rule

192. There is an exception to the general rule, acknowledged explicitly by both the USA
and Canada in their submissions — whenever it can be proved that the courts were not
neutral and independent, especially from the other branches of power of the host State.

193. The USA has opined that!”*:

“Of course, where a judiciary is not separate from other organs of the State and
those organs (executive or legislative) direct or otherwise interfere with a
domestic court decision so as to cause an effective expropriation, these executive
or legislative acts may form the basis of a separate claim under Article 1110,
depending on the circumstances.”

194. The submission by Canada confirms the exception by stating that “[a] neutral and
independent judicial determination [...] does not give rise to separate claim of
expropriation under customary international law!”””, thus implying that such a separate
claim could be found valid if the judicial determination under question was not neutral
or independent.

195. In the current case, the Tribunal does not find sufficient proof to apply the above
exception:

- No proof has been marshalled as to the interference of the executive or legislative
branches of Mexico’s government in the course of the local proceedings;

- Even though Claimant has presented allegations of bias by Mexico’s courts!*°,

these are not substantiated by evidence; and
- The decisions of the courts failed to benefit the Respondent State.

196. Thus, the Tribunal finds that it must first adjudicate Lion’s claim for denial of justice
(VI.1), then it will analyse the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies (VI.2),
establish its conclusions (VI.3) and finally devote a short chapter to Claimant’s
alternative claims (V1.4).

OF JUSTICE

197. Claimant avers that it was denied justice by the Mexican judicial system.

198. The Tribunal will first make an introduction (1.), then it will provide a summary of
Claimant’s and Respondent’s respective positions (2. and 3.) and finally it shall make
a decision (4.).

1. OVERVIEW
199. Denial of justice, referred to as denegacién de justicia in Spanish, is

“a defect in a country’s organization of courts or administration of justice,
resulting in the country’s violating its international legal duties to protect
aliens”'*!.

200. The concept reaches back to the Middle Ages'*?, when private reprisals were allowed
against acts of injustice committed by actors of another State!*?, It later evolved into
diplomatic protection assumed by States!*+, Traditionally, some authors perceived
denial of justice as any internationally illegal treatment of aliens!*°:

“A denial of justice, in a broad sense, occurs whenever a State, through any
department or agency, fails to observe, with respect to an alien, any duty imposed
by international law or by treaty with his country”,

201. However, currently a narrower view prevails, although there is much debate on what
specific State actions constitute denial of justice: points of contention include whether
the concept encompasses administrative acts, whether manifestly unjust court decisions
on the merits can constitute denial of justice, and whether subjective elements, such as
bad faith, should be required!*°.

202. In 1935, de Visscher famously described denial of justice as “one of the oldest and one
of the worst elucidated [concepts] in international law” '*’. Despite the passage of
nearly a century, de Visscher’s statement still stands true.

203. Paulsson, one of the most prominent contemporary researchers on the subject, has
defined denial of justice as follows!**:

“[dJenial of justice arises when proceedings are so faulty as to exclude all
reasonable expectation of a fair decision [...]”.

204. Paulsson’s definition puts the emphasis on the active subject (judicial bodies of the host
State) and on the wrongdoing (very grave breaches of due process to the detriment of
the alien, which preclude the possibility of an unjust decision on the merits be
reviewed).

Applicability under the NAFTA

205. Nowhere in the NAFTA treaty do the words “denial of justice” appear. The same
happens in most investment treaties. There is, however, unanimous agreement among
the Parties (including the Non-Disputing Parties) that denial of justice is an
international wrong which breaches the fair and equitable treatment [“FET”] standard.
Case law and doctrine reach the same conclusion!®?.

206. Art. 1105 NAFTA delineates the FET standard:
“Article 1105: Minimum Standard of Treatment
1. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment
in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and

full protection and security.”

207. Art. 1131(2) of the NAFTA states that an interpretation by the Free Trade Commission
of a NAFTA provision “shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section”.

208. One such interpretation was provided on the protections under Art. 1105 of the
NAFTA. The Interpretation Note of July 31, 2001 [the “FTC Note”] states as follows:

“(T]he Free Trade Commission hereby adopts the following interpretations of
Chapter Eleven in order to clarify and reaffirm the meaning of certain of its
provisions: [...]

B. Minimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with International Law

1. Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard
of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to
investments of investors of another Party.

2. The concepts of "fair and equitable treatment" and "full protection and security"
do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the
international law mini standard of of aliens.” [E i

added]

In light of the Interpretation Note, the protection to be accorded to investors under the
FET and full protection and security standards is set at the level of “customary
international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens”.

Since Claimant has brought a case of denial of justice by the Mexican Courts, the
adjudication of this case requires that the Tribunal determine what “customary

international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens” is expected from those
Courts. Breach of that standard implies denial of justice.

PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE DENIAL OF JUSTICE

In its Memorial, Claimant argues that the Minimum Standard of Treatment under
Article 1105 (1) of the NAFTA incorporates a threefold protection for investors in their
dealings with local Courts. Thus, local Courts are prohibited from:

- incurring unreasonable delay in administering justice!”°,

- refusing the investors access to justice!®', and

- rendering manifestly unjust and erroneous decisions that a competent judge
would not have taken'*,

In Claimant’s view, denial of justice can thus be subsumed in two great categories:
procedural and substantive denial of justice.

Claimant’s Reply provides a more elaborate typology of denial of justice, introducing
a two-fold differentiation into “déni de justice” and “défi de justice” proposed by the

Institut de Droit International'®> and a four-fold one under the Harvard Draft
Convention'®*, which includes substantive denial of justice as one of the categories'?>:

“A state is responsible if an injury to an alien results from a denial of justice.
Denial of justice exists when there is

[i] a denial, unwarranted delay or obstruction of access to courts,
[ii] gross deficiency in the administration of judicial or remedial process,

[iii] failure to provide those guaranties which are generally considered
indispensable to the proper administration of justice, or

[iv] a manifestly unjust judgment. An error of a national court which does not
produce manifest injustice is not a denial of justice”.

In differentiating between substantive and procedural denial of justice, Lion finds
support in Oostergetel'®®.

Respondent in turn argues that denial of justice is always procedural”.

Mexico retorts that the artificial distinction made by the Oostergetel tribunal is
misleading and that ultimately it did not lead to the application of any other standard
for denial of justice than the traditional, very high one'**. Respondent also claims that
the Harvard Draft Convention and the Institut de Droite International’s Draft Articles
are irrelevant, because they lack customary law status'”.

The view of the Tribunal

The Tribunal agrees with Respondent, who convincingly argues that there is no
“substantive denial of justice”. While the dichotomy between substantive and
procedural denial of justice has indeed been adopted (to greater or lower endorsement)
by some arbitral tribunals”, this differentiation is not useful. To determine whether a
judgment was outrageous or egregious on the merits would require a tribunal to delve

into the decision-making process under national law — it is trite to repeat that
international tribunals cannot be and do not constitute domestic courts of appeal??!.

218. The Tribunal endorses Paulsson’s view that:

“in modern international law there is no place for substantive denial of justice [.
Ifa judgment is gross/y unjust, it is because the victim has not been afforded fair
treatment [...] Extreme cases should thus be dealt with on the footing that they
are so unjustifiable that they could have been only the product of bias or some
other violation of the right of due process*””

 

“[...] denial of justice is always procedural?”.”

219. Paulsson adds that manoeuvring the line between what appears to be substantively
unjust and what is unjust or erroneous because of gross procedural breaches is “the
greatest difficulty of our subject” and explains that?™*:

“gross or notorious injustice - whatever the words used - is not a denial of justice
merely because the lusion appears to be d bly wrong in sut 5 it
must impel the adjudicator to conclude that it could not have been reached by any
impartial judicial body worthy of that name”.

1.2. TYPES

220. A review of case law and scholarly writings reveal that procedural denial of justice can
be classified in subtypes: the right to access justice (A.); the right to be heard and to
present one’s case (B.); and the right to obtain a decision without undue delay (C.).
These are some of the separate manifestations of denial of justice and, if committed
against an alien, constitute international wrongs which can be imputed against the State.

A. Denying an alien access to justice

221. The first category of procedural denial of justice is uncontroversial. Prof. Paparinskis
writes”°5:

“The easiest case, accepted as uncontroversially wrongful under the Hague
Conference, was a discriminatory denial of access to court, described in the Hague
Texts as the situation where ‘the foreigner has been hindered by the judicial
authorities in the exercise of his right to pursue judicial remedies”.

20! See e.g., Exh. CLA-272, E. Jiménez de Aréchaga, “International Law in the Past Third of a Century”, /59

He also provides the following examples””*:

“[...] a purposeful disruption of the commencement of the proceedings, or even
the absence of notification about proceedings that exclude the possibility to
challenge them could all result in denial of justice”.
Freeman in turn explains due process under international law in the following words”””:
“whenever judicial action is taken without giving the alien a hearing or without
properly notifying him in order to prepare a defense; whenever misconduct of the
judge in withholding, hiding or destroying papers essential to the foreigner’s cause
is prejudicial in effect; whenever he has not been permitted to produce evidence
or to summon valuable witnesses”.

Case law supports this view.

The judgment in Ambatielos offers insight into the basic right of foreigners to access
local courts in pursuit of justice”°*:

“Thus, when ‘free access to the Courts’ is covenanted by a State in favour of the
subjects or citizens of another State, the covenant is that the foreigner shall enjoy
full freedom to appear before the cou: _
whether as plaintiff or defendant; to bring any action provided or authorized by
law [...]” [Emphasis added].

    

In Idler the US-Venezuela Commission found that the American claimant, Mr. Idler,
was denied justice when the Supreme Court in Caracas gave him notice of an
impending hearing without sufficient time for him to physically be able to appear in
court?”?,

The Cotesworth & Powell tribunal described the following facts as an “absolute denial
of justice”?!°:

“Still, a plain violation of the substance of natural justice, as, for example, refusing
to hear the party interested, or to allow him opportunity to produce proofs,
amounts to the same thing as an absolute denial of justice”.

AI-Bahloul explicitly recognized that due process breaches include not notifying the
investor of hearings and that deciding in the investor’s absence amounts to a gross
violation of procedural rules ?!!.

The right to access justice also extends to the right to lodge appeal. This aspect was
discussed by the tribunal in A/-Bahloul, where the claimant alleged that his appeals
were wrongfully rejected without regard to due process standards?! — the tribunal
explicitly acknowledged that the allegations could constitute a denial of due process
(but ultimately dismissed the claim because of the limited evidence on the record”!*).

B. Denying an alien the right of defense or to present evidence

The violation of an alien’s right of defense or to present evidence as an international
wrong amounting to denial of justice has been universally recognized by academia”!*.

“Still, a plain violation of the substance of natural justice, as, for example, refusing

to hear the party interested, or to allow him [an] opportunity to produce proofs,

amounts to the same thing as an absolute denial of justice”. [Emphasis added]
In the Ambatielos ruling?'*:

“the covenant is that the foreigner shall enjoy full freedom to [...] deliver any
pleading by way of defence, set off or counterclaim; to engage Counsel; to adduce
evidence, whether documentary or oral or of any other kind; to apply for bail; to
lodge appeals and, in short, to use the Courts fully and to avail himself of any
procedural remedies or guarantees provided by the law of the land in order that
justice may be administered on a footing of equality with nationals of the
country.”,

“[mJost frequently a denial of justice may result from a serious defect in the
adjudicative process, such as a violation of ... the right to be heard and to present
evidence [...]?"””.

The US-Mexico General Claims Commission in Chattin found that local courts
displayed “a most astonishing lack of seriousness” because there was “no trace of an
effort to have the two foremost pieces of evidence explained”, there was no inquiry
made into verifying the statement of a key witness in the domestic prosecution
proceedings and there was no effort to examine a witness who could have presented
important exculpatory evidence?!*.

In Ballistini, the claimant was denied a crucial piece of evidence necessary to make his
case because the judge he accused of arbitrariness deliberately withheld the documents.
The French-Venezuelan Commission found a denial of justice

“because the local authorities deprived Mr. Ballistini of the legal means of
instituting before the competent tribunals the actions which the laws would
authorize him in case he might improperly have been condemned to a criminal
judgment.?!°”

In Joseph F. Rihani*”’, the Supreme Court of Justice of Mexico reversed the decisions
of lower courts in enforcement proceedings because it claimed that critical evidence —
that was clearly on the record and discussed by one of the justices — had in fact not
been presented before it. The American Mexican Claims Commission found that there
was denial of justice as?!:

“[I]n the face of the clear and indisputable evidence in the record to the contrary,
more particularly in view of the fact that the, attention of the court had been drawn
to such evidence by one of its members warrants the conclusion that the said court
wilfully disregarded such evidence; that the decision of the court was lacking in
good faith and that the same fell so far short of international standards as to
amount to a denial of justice” [Emphasis added]

C. Prohibition of undue delay

The final type of procedural denial of justice concerns undue delay in the rendering of
a judgement by the local Courts.

239. There is unanimous agreement by scholars that undue delay in the exercise of justice

is a separate type of denial of justice?”’.

240. As early as the Fabiani? case discussed supra, international tribunals have agreed that

“justice delayed is justice denied”. It is widely recognized that undue delay amounts to
a denial of due process”™4.

241. It is common ground that there is no abstract manner of determining whether a

particular period constitutes reasonable delay but each case should be scrutinized under
the specific facts””>. For example, in Pey Casado®, a period of seven years without
rendering a first instance decision by local courts amounted to a denial of justice. In E/
Oro Mining and Railway Co.?*’, the Great Britain and Mexico Claims Commission
found that the passage of nine years without a hearing in its case for compensation for
having provided materials to the government, constituted a denial of justice. However,
in Oostergetel, the length of local proceedings of two years was found not to be in
breach of the international minimum standard’,

242. The tribunal in Chevron devised a widely recognized test for denial of justice for undue

delay: it found that “some of the factors that may be considered are the complexity of
the case, the behaviour of the litigants involved, the significance of the interests at stake
in the case, and the behaviour of the Courts themselves” 7’.

243. The Chevron test was followed by the tribunal in Oostergetel**°.

244. Similarly, the more recent Toto Construzioni?*! decision, discussed in detail by both

 

Parties in their submissions, has stated that”:

“There is not, under international law, a specific measure by which lapses of time
may be condemned as excessive: the lapse is to be considered on a case-by-case

denial of justice]”, with reference to denial of access to justice and denial of justice for undue delay. Paulsson

basis, taking into account (i) the complexity of the matter; (ii) the need for celerity
of decision; and (iii) the diligence of claimant in prosecuting its case.”

1.3. STANDARD

245. The Tribunal has already noted that denial of justice has been conceived by
international customary law and that there is no treaty formula under the NAFTA (and
most treaties for that matter) which can offer guidance on which judicial actions
attributable to States amount to justitia denegata. Additionally, the Tribunal has
decided that denial of justice can only be procedural.

246. The question remains, however: how to differentiate between procedural decisions
properly adopted by local Courts, which are contrary to the alien’s interests, and those
which amount to an international wrong and engage the responsibility of the State. To
clarify this issue the Tribunal shall undertake a brief analysis of some of the major
denial of justice cases”** starting with those of the 19/20" century (A.), then it shall
continue with more recent decisions (B.), present the Parties’ positions (C.) and reach
a conclusion (D.).

A. Late 19" and early 20" century cases

247. At the turn of the 19" and 20" centuries, there was a proliferation of denial of justice
decisions that still today serve as guidance for investment tribunals. On the other hand,
certain ideas of the concept of denial of justice developed under these early decisions
have been superseded?™4.

248. In Cotesworth & Powell, a decision from 1875, the international tribunal found
multiple instances of denial of justice. A sentence of classification in bankruptcy
proceedings was deemed unjust for illegally excluding claimants as common creditors
and failing to notify them of the proceedings***. Additionally, a sentence issued without
hearing the claimants in the case as plaintiffs in the suit was also found to constitute
denial of justice’. Another denial arose from a one-year delay in notifying an
important judicial sentence?*’. Finally, the tribunal identified a conflict between
decisions made by the same courts?**.

233 The Tribunal has excluded cases with negative finding of denial of justice, where the denial of justice was
administrative rather than judicial, and where the basis for the judgment was judicial expropriation. Only
analysing positive findings of judicial denial of justice and excluding instances of judicial expropriation, makes
the vast majority of the case law discussed by the Parties inapposite.

Idler, a case decided in 1890, concerned the use of an obscure legal remedy from
medieval times, which allowed the reversal of any judgments or proceedings
detrimental to the government, used by the State to annul previous Court decisions
favourable to the alien. The US-Venezuela Commission found that the singular
invocation of this ancient remedy by the Supreme Court of Venezuela served to
circumvent enforcement of the decisions in favour of the alien and thus constituted a
denial of justice’. The Commission also found that the claimant was denied justice
because the notice of proceedings he was given made it impossible for him to appear
in court™”,

In Fabiani, a case from 1896, Venezuela was held responsible for denial of justice,
because its courts refused to enforce an arbitral award of a French national against his
Venezuelan partners due to strictly procedural arguments, which amounted to a
“disguised refusal to rule” (“refis déguisé de statuer”**"). The arbitrator also found that
the claimant was subjected to undue delay”.

In Ballistini**, a decision of the French-Venezuelan Commission of 1902, a
Venezuelan judge wrongfully rendered judgment for calumny and injuries against a
foreigner. When Mr. Ballistini sued the judge, who apparently had issued an arbitrary
decision to arrest him, the same judge withheld the necessary documentary evidence,
making it impossible for Mr. Ballistini to make an effective case before local courts.
The Commission found that the claimant had been denied justice:

“Tb]Jecause the local authorities deprived Ballistini of the legal means of instituting
before the competent tribunals the actions which the laws would authorize him in
case he might improperly have been condemned to a criminal judgment” **.

In the Chattin case of 1928, the American-Mexican Claims Commission found a denial
of justice. Mr. Chattin was arrested illegally and sentenced to two years of jail for
embezzlement on the basis of spurious evidence, in a trial in which he was not duly
informed regarding the charges brought against him and in which the Court hearings
lasted as little as five minutes. This was a landmark decision regarding basic
procedural guarantees to be afforded to foreigners.

The Neer case and the subjective element of denial of justice

One of the traditionally recognized leading cases on denial of justice is the 1926 award
of the US-Mexico General Claims Commission in L. F. H. Neer and Pauline Neer. In
its decision, the US-Mexico Commission laid out its standard?“°:

“(T]he treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinquency,
should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to an
insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that
every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency”.

The imprint made by Neer on the concept of denial of justice has been palpable in
investment arbitration awards”4’; however, it appears that the reliance on the case has
rightfully declined in the recent years.

The Mondev tribunal was correct in stating that the facts in Neer were centred on a
State’s alleged failure to carry out an effective police investigation into a foreigner’s
murder, and are not apposite when discussing treatment of aliens under the FET

standard’, As the Azurix tribunal found’:

“the traditional Neer formula ... reflects the traditional, and not necessarily the
contemporary, definition of the customary minimum standard, at least in certain
non-investment fields”.

Other tribunals have agreed that the Neer standard may have reflected the minimum
standard — but only as of 1927 and not in contemporary times?°°.

Similarly, Paulsson writes that
“there should be no doubt that, to the extent that customary-law minimum

standard has any role to play in the interpretation of investment treaties, the Neer
formula is of limited import” **'.

An additional reason why the Neer standard has become less relevant is that it explicitly
requires the finding of bad faith”. This notion has been rejected by NAFTA decisions
concerning denial of justice”, and authors alike?™*.

B. Recent denial of justice decisions

The Parties have not drawn the Tribunal’s attention to any NAFTA decision with a
positive finding of denial of justice.

The Tribunal will briefly analyse Mondev and Loewen, the two major cases discussed
by the Parties. The Tribunal shall also discuss Dan Cake — a very recent award finding
for denial of justice in a non-NAFTA case.

The Mondev case

The Mondev case (2002) concerned a failed investment in the USA by a Canadian
construction company and involved a claim that the local authorities prevented the
claimant from exercising an option to purchase a certain parcel of land. When the
claimant filed a case before US courts, the jury found against the local authorities, a
decision which was later overturned on appeal. The claimant then failed to obtain a
judgment in its favour from the Massachusetts Supreme Court and the US Supreme
Court rejected the case by not granting certiorari. According to the claimant, the
Massachusetts Supreme Court deviated from its previous rulings to the extent that it
had in effect applied “a new rule”.

The Mondev tribunal did not find that denial of justice had occurred as, in any common
law jurisdiction, one may and should expect “new” judge-made law and the decisions
taken by the US courts were not “extreme cases” that would amount to a denial of
justice.

The Mondev tribunal found that denial of justice would require”:

“a wilful disregard of due process of law, [...] which shocks, or at least surprises,
a sense of judicial propriety”.

25. Exh, CLA-277, “[t]he treatment of an alien . . . should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect
of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of intemational standards that every
reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency" [Emphasis added], Neer, pp. 61-62.

253 See e.g., ADF, para. 181, Mondev, paras. 116-117, Loewen, para. 132, CMS, para. 280, Glamis Gold, para.

627.

254 See e.g. Paulsson Lecture, pp. 34-35, Opinion of Christopher Greenwood, Q.C. of March 26, 2001 (on the
denial of justice under international law) in Loewen, para. 64.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

Its analysis did not end here, however. The tribunal continued to explain that?*°:

“The Tribunal would stress that the word “surprises” does not occur in isolation.
The test is not whether a particular result is surprising, but whether the shock or
surprise occasioned to an impartial tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified
concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome, bearing in mind on the one
hand that international tribunals are not courts of appeal, and on the other hand
that Chapter 11 of NAFTA (like other treaties for the protection of investments)
is intended to provide a real measure of protection. In the end the question is
whether, at_an_ international level _and having regard to generally accepted

dards of the inistration of justice, a tribunal can lude in the light of
all the available facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper_and
discreditable, with the result that the investment has been subjected to unfair and
inequitable treatment. This is admittedly a somewhat open-ended standard, but it
may be that in practice no more precise formula can be offered to cover the range
of possibilities”. [Emphasis added].

Mondey also determined that the threshold for establishing treatment in violation of the
FET standard had evolved in the past century and that currently it does not require
subjective elements on the part of the Host State such as bad faith’:

“To the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the
outrageous or the egregious. In particular, a State may treat a foreign investment
unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith [...] the content of
the minimum standard today cannot be limited to the content of customary
international law as recognised in arbitral decisions in the 1920s”.

The Loewen case

In Loewen (2003), the other major case discussed by the Parties, a Canadian funeral
home conglomerate challenged a Mississippi State Court jury award of USD 100 M in
compensatory damages and USD 400 M in punitive damages on claims that included
fraud and violations of Mississippi antitrust law. The claimant argued that, apart from
the egregious damages decision by the Mississippi State court, it was also wronged by
the application of civil procedure rules requiring it to post USD 625 M to stay execution
of the judgment pending appeal.

Interestingly, the investment tribunal appeared to lean towards finding that claimant
was indeed denied justice under the facts of the case**:

“After all, we have held that judicial wrongs may in principle be brought home to
the State Party under Chapter Eleven, and have criticised the Mississippi

proceedings in the strongest terms. There was unfairness here towards the foreign
investor”.

The Loewen tribunal used the following test, according to which denial of justice
amounts to?*?:

“[mlJanifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due process leading to an outcome
which offends a sense of judicial propriety”

Loewen also endorsed the Mondev view that under contemporary international
customary law, bad faith or malicious intent is not required for a denial of justice”:

“Neither State practice, the decisions of international tribunals nor the opinion of
commentators support the view that bad faith or malicious intention is an essential
element of unfair and inequitable treatment or denial of justice amounting to a
breach of international justice”.

However, the Loewen tribunal ultimately found that the claimant had failed to exhaust
all available local remedies when it decided to reach a settlement rather than pursue its
case before the US Supreme Court”®!.

Apart from the claimant not having exhausted the available local remedies, Loewen’s
claims were dismissed for lack of standing, due to claimant’s buyout by a company of
the Host State (which led to claimant losing its status as a foreign investor under the
NAFTA).

The Parties have dedicated a lengthy discussion to the Mondev and Loewen decisions.
The Tribunal observes that these cases may offer assistance regarding the applicable
standard of denial of justice in the abstract. The underlying facts of those cases,
however, substantially differ from the ones in this case.

The Dan Cake case

In a recent non-NAFTA decision of 2015, the Dan Cake tribunal found denial of
justice: under Hungarian law the claimant’s enterprise, that was in liquidation, was
entitled to convene a composition hearing in order to seek an agreement with its
creditors. Instead of following the established procedure, the Metropolitan Court of
Budapest ordered claimant to submit a number of documents not required by law, and
which the claimant was unable to provide. The tribunal considered that such order was

unnecessary and that it prejudged and denied the claimant’s right to seek an agreement
with its creditors”.

Based on these grounds and taking into account that there was no appeal from the
Court’s order?®, the tribunal found that the Court’s conduct “[did] shock a sense of
judicial propriety?” and that thus claimant had been denied justice.

C. The position of the Parties and the Non-Disputing Parties

The Tribunal shall briefly summarize the positions of Claimant and Respondent on the
applicable standard for denial of justice. The Tribunal will also review the Non-
Disputing Parties’ observations on this matter in their NAFTA Art. 1128 submissions.

Claimant’s position

Claimant argues that with respect to procedural denial of justice, the Tribunal should
follow the Oostergete/ tribunal and apply a standard that the procedural irregularities
be “severe” and affect the outcome of the dispute and that any undue delay be
“excessive”,

Lion also claims that it is sufficient for it to prove that Mexico’s courts failed to remedy
the prior denial of justice, which consisted in the service of process made in a manner
inconsistent with the applicable international standards and local law?®.

Lion also attacks the Mondev standard proposed by Respondent by stating that the
decision was based on an incorrect legal basis: that of arbitrariness rather than denial
of justice?*’.

Mexico’s position

Respondent in turn argues that a single very high standard should apply to all types of
denial of justice’. This single standard for the finding of denial of justice should be
based on the Mondev case”:

“[...] a wilful disregard of due process of law, ... which shocks, or at least
surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.”

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

According to Mexico, the Mondev tribunal was not wrong in referring to arbitrariness
as part of NAFTA’s Art. 1105 minimum standard of treatment. What the tribunal in
Mondey did was to hold the criterion of arbitrariness “useful in the context of denial of
justice”?”°, while fully acknowledging the difference between the two.

Mexico emphasizes that the standard for denial of justice is very high, summarizing its
scope in the following words?’!:

“The threshold to establish denial of justice is very high — e.g. requiring a
‘notoriously unjust’ or ’egregious’ administration of justice ‘which offends a
sense of judicial propriety’. It does not suffice to establish that domestic
adjudicators have erred, or misapplied or misinterpreted domestic law”.

The USA’s position

In its submission the USA explicitly identifies the denial of justice threshold as high?”*,
due to the principle of judicial independence, the particular nature of judicial action
and the unique status of the judiciary in both international and municipal legal
systems?’>. International tribunals should accord deference to domestic courts, whose
judgments are presumed to be regular under international law to a higher degree than
the actions of a State’s legislative or administrative branch?”*.

The USA provides examples for denial of justice: an “obstruction of access to courts”
or a “failure to provide those guarantees which are generally considered indispensable
to the proper administration of justice?”>”.

The USA emphasizes the argument that domestic court decisions, or misapplications
or misinterpretation of domestic law, do not in themselves constitute a denial of justice
under customary international law?”°.

Canada’s position

Like the USA, Canada advocates for a high standard for denial of justice claims and
evokes the traditional standard of Court actions or omissions being “extremely gross”
or “egregious” or amounting to “an outrage, bad faith, wilful neglect of duty, or

insufficiency of action apparent to any unbiased man”?’’. The high standard is
amplified by the need of international tribunals to defer to local Courts?’*.

Canada lists as examples of denial of justice instances where there has been

“a refusal to entertain a suit or serious failure to adequately administer justice or
if there has been a ‘clear and malicious misapplication of the law’ or if the
judgment in question is so patently egregious that ‘it is impossible for a third party
to recognize how an impartial judge could have reached the result in question”.
279

D. The Tribunal’s view

The very high standard adopted by Mondev has been endorsed by a multitude of
tribunals, NAFTA?®® and non-NAFTA~*! alike. The Tribunal also notes that the test
has been proposed by Respondent?*? and endorsed by both Non-Disputing Parties?**.

The Tribunal accepts the Mondev standard as a guide to adjudicate Lion’s denial of
justice claim. However, some precisions are required in light of the arguments
presented by the Parties.

The starting point for the tribunal in Mondev was the ELSI judgement. In this case the
ICJ assessed the concept of “arbitrariness” under the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce
and Navigation between the USA and Italy, in the context of a dispute concerning the
requisition and forced liquidation of an insolvent Italian company wholly owned by a
US corporation. In this setting the ICJ stated that arbitrariness was***:

“a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises,
a sense of juridical propriety”.

The Mondeyv tribunal replicated the above statement”*’. Taking this isolated sentence,
Mexico has suggested that a finding of denial of justice requires “evidence of intention
or malice, collusion, corruption, or flagrant abuse by the Respondent’s judicial
system)

The Tribunal does not agree with Mexico’s conclusion, which is only the result of an
incomplete reading of the Mondev standard.

The Mondev tribunal acknowledge that the ELS/ standard was defined in the context
of evaluating arbitrariness, but considered it useful in further defining the test for denial
of justice’*”. The tribunal continued stating that for denial of justice?**:

“*,, the test is not whether a particular result is surprising, but whether the shock
or surprise occasioned to an impartial tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified
concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome...”.

The tribunal continued to frame this test within the standard of FET under Article
1105(1) of NAFTA®”:

“Tn the end the question is whether, at an international level and having regard to
generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a tribunal can
conclude in the light of all the available facts that the impugned decision was
clearly improper and discreditable, with the result that the investment has been
subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment”.

In defining the test for denial of justice, nowhere does the Mondeyv tribunal allude to a
subjective element. Moreover, in assessing international liability of the Contracting
States under Article 1105(1) of NAFTA, the tribunal explicitly rejected this
possibility?”°:

“To the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the

outrageous or the egregious. In particular, a State may treat foreign investment
unfairly and_i itably without necessarily acting in bad faith” [Emphasis

added].

accessory element in discerning whether denial of justice has occurred, but it is not a
necessary requirement.
The Loewen tribunal used a similar test, stressing that denial of justice is procedural”:

“[mlJanifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due process leading to an outcome
which offends a sense of judicial propriety”.

Loewen also endorsed the Mondev view that under contemporary international
customary law, bad faith or malicious intent is not required for a denial of justice claim,
framed within the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Article 1105(1) NAFTA2™:

“Neither State practice, the decisions of international tribunals nor the opinion of
commentators support the view that bad faith or malicious intention is an essential
element of unfair and inequitable treatment or denial of justice amounting to a
breach of international justice”.

ae KK

In conclusion, the test is an objective one: denial of justice requires a finding of an
improper and egregious procedural conduct by the local courts (whether intentional or
not), which does not meet the basic internationally accepted standards of administration
of justice and due process, and which shocks or surprises the sense of judicial propriety.

CLAIMANT’S POSITION

Lion says that Mexico breached its duty to treat it ina fair and equitable manner through
denying Lion justice in its pursuit of legal remedies against the Debtors: Claimant
argues that it was not accorded proper due process rights, since first, it was not granted
the opportunity to be heard and then, it was deprived of the legal means to defend its
rights (2.1.); Lion also maintains that it suffered undue delay in the local proceedings
(2.2.); finally, Lion argues that it complied with the exhaustion of local remedies rule
(2.3.).

CLAIMANT WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS
Claimant argues that it was denied justice through the violation of its due process rights

by being barred access to justice (A.) and being prevented from presenting its case
before local courts and marshalling evidence to support it (B.).

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

A. Lion was denied access to justice

Claimant was denied the chance to participate before the Juez de lo Mercantil because
it was never properly served.

Under Mexican law, proper notification by a Court is subject to making certain
(“cerciorarse’”) that the defendant indeed resides in the place where service is made;
the service confirmation should explain the reason that led the Court to be certain
(“convencimiento”)*?>. This obligation is enshrined in Arts. 111, 112 and 112 bis, of
the Civil Procedure Code of Jalisco [“CPC Jalisco”]”°°. Additionally, Art. 279 of CPC
Jalisco requires the Juez de lo Mercantil to “examine the legality of the service of
process” (“examinard la legalidad del emplazamiento”) before declaring Lion in
default?*”.

Lion argues that Mexico clearly failed to comply with these provisions.

First, the Court based the citation address solely on the domicile indicated by the
plaintiff, designated in the Forged Settlement Agreement — a document which was not
an original and bore no original signatures. This notwithstanding, the Court accepted
the false information without further research”*.

Second the Court’s actuario failed to “include particular reasons or objective proof”,
and to indicate the means upon which Lion’s domicile was corroborated; apparently,
the Court’s actuario only relied on the word of the person served, Lic. José Isaac Lopez
Medina, although he provided no indication or proof of his position at Lion nor any
evidence that he had representation powers*”’. According to Claimant, the Juez de lo
Mercantil acted erroneously and failed to exercise diligence to ensure that Lion was
properly served*”!.

Third, Lion avers that notification by cédula was inappropriate given the circumstances
of the case*?. According to Lion, notification by judicial bulletins or boards amounts
to fictitious service of process, which is clearly inconsistent with the treatment to be
given to a foreign company*°?. Service on Claimant by the Juez de lo Mercantil was

inconsistent with two international treaties to which Mexico is party — the Inter-
American Convention on Letters Rogatory (with its Additional Protocol) and the
Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and
Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters*™ — personal service to Lion
should have been made via an international cooperation mechanism*°>.

Furthermore, Claimant reinforces its argument by stating that a different standard for
service was employed by judicial personnel with regard to the Debtors. For example,
Claimant observes that while in average, it took a Court in Mexico 42 days to admit
and serve a lawsuit*’°, the Juez de lo Civil failed to serve the Juicio Hipotecario on
Inmobiliaria Bains for more than three years, and at the same time required only 22
days to serve the incorrect emplazamiento on Lion*®’.

Finally, Lion avers that it was limited in its pursuit of justice before local Courts,
because it was barred from bringing an ordinary appeal against the Cancellation
Judgment, due to an incorrect decision by the Juez de lo Mercantil granting said
Judgment res judicata effect in only 42 days, at the request of the Debtors*”*.

B. Claimant was deprived of its right to exercise means of defense

Claimant says that it was not allowed to properly defend itself. Respondent denied it
access to justice through its Courts’ continuous failure to scrutinize the authenticity of
the forged documents*”:

First, the Juez de lo Mercantil should have looked ex officio into the nature of the
Forged Settlement Agreement and the documentation indicating that Lion was a
foreign company*"” before declaring Lion in default*!!.

Second, Mexico’s Courts have denied Lion the opportunity to prove the forgery. Lion
submitted the ampliacién de demanda as soon as it gained knowledge of the facts
underlying the forgery and cannot be blamed for not having raised the issue ab initio®!.
In Claimant’s view, lack of service is a breach of such a magnitude under Mexican law
that the Juez de Distrito should have allowed all evidence and arguments that are
necessary to prove the circumstances of the allegedly illegal service*!, yet the Juez de

Distrito dismissed any evidence pointing to the falsehood of the emplazamiento*'+. And
then the Juez de Distrito’s decision in the remand Amparo refused to admit
Sr. Arechederra’s testimony, thereby depriving Lion of the principal evidence that
could prove that the person alleged to have signed the False Amparo did not do so*!>.

Third, none of Mexico’s Courts seized of Lion’s proceedings ruled on the authenticity
of the Forged Settlement Agreement. The Juez de Distrito refused to decide on the
issue*!®; the Tribunal de Queja refused as well*!’, ruling that the question should be
resolved after the False Amparo issue was decided in the Remand Amparo; and finally
the Juez de Distrito refused*'*, understanding that the Tribunal de Queja had excluded
from the admissible evidence the evidence concerning the falsehood of the Forged
Settlement Agreement*"”. Ultimately, Lion’s Amparo claim was thus frustrated.

MEXICO’S UNREASONABLE DELAY IN ADMINISTERING JUSTICE

According to Claimant, Mexico’s Courts failed to decide Lion’s Amparo claim within
a reasonable time.

Claimant avers that the time required for the resolution of the Amparo lawsuit was at
odds with the usual duration of such proceedings in Mexico. According to the statistics
from the Mexican Consejo de la Judicatura Federal, the Amparo lawsuit took almost
four times as long as the average for the same year?”°.

To determine if this delay is unreasonable and amounts to a denial of justice,
international tribunals consider three features*”!:

- The complexity of the matter: Claimant maintains that the claim submitted to the
Juez de Distrito and the Tribunal de Queja was not complex; given that the
service was performed at the address and to the person mentioned in the Forged
Settlement Agreement, there was only one issue to be decided by the Courts in
order to determine whether Lion was properly served — was the Forged
Settlement Agreement authentic?*?? Claimant states that under normal
circumstances, the authenticity of a document is a factual issue that is disposed
of preliminarily as a procedural incident*?’.

- The procedural diligence of the interested parties: Claimant did not cause any

as it learned of the existence of the Forged Settlement Agreement, it filed a

petition to challenge its authenticity**>.

- Whether celerity is especially warranted to avoid harm generated in the legal
situation of the person involved in the process: Lion submits that celerity was
essential because the Amparo claim, as a remedy to ultimately prevent the
cancellation of the Mortgages, would become ineffective as time went by>”°.

On a separate note, Claimant compares the delay in its claims with the unusual speed
of the Cancellation Judgment, which deprived it of its investment in Mexico*?’.

CLAIMANT COMPLIED WITH THE EXHAUSTION OF LOCAL REMEDIES RULE
Claimant begins by stating that under international law, the State arguing that a party
has failed to exhaust local remedies has the burden to prove the existence, availability

and adequacy of such remedies??8, and Mexico has failed to discharge this duty.

According to Lion, it fully complied with the exhaustion requirement as it did pursue
all adequate remedies available to it*?? (A.)

Notwithstanding, Lion was not required to exhaust all local remedies because:

- The remedies available were inadequate, ineffective and their exhaustion
unreasonable**” (B.), and

- A denial of justice for undue delay claim is not subject to the exhaustion
requirement**! (C.).

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

A. — Lion’s claims did not require further action before Mexico’s courts

Lion argues that the exhaustion of local remedies rule applies to those domestic
recourses that are likely to be successful. In the case at hand, the remedies to be
exhausted would be those which could reinstate the Mortgages to Lion; and Lion did
pursue them>*?, Lion was not required to initiate any proceedings other than the
Amparo as it was not feasible for it to launch the juicio de nulidad, which offered
inferior protection to the Amparo route. The criminal proceedings did not offer
appropriate protection either.

  

Claimant elaborates on the concept of ‘original judicial misconduct’>* and

distinguishes between the initial wrong, the denial of justice and the exhaustion of local
remedies, which requires the exhaustion of all adequate available remedies***.
Following this threefold concept, Claimant avers that in the present case:

- The initial wrong would be the Debtors’ fraudulent actions;

- The denial of justice would be the breach of Lion’s right to be heard by the Juez
de lo Mercantil and

- What followed after the Cancellation Proceeding (i.e., the Amparo Proceeding,
the Revision Appeal Proceeding and the Remanded Proceeding) is the exhaustion
of local remedies, where the “system” failed to correct the initial miscarriage of
justice**’.

Lion argues that, since all three elements were met, it did in fact exhaust the adequate
available local remedies, thus complying with the exhaustion rule under international
law>*°,

B. Lion was exempted from exhausting available local remedies

In any event, Claimant states that, under international law, it was exempted from the
exhaustion rule as the local remedies were inadequate, ineffective and their exhaustion
unreasonable**”.

Award

Lion uses the Loewen standard, stating that only “remedies which are effective and
adequate and are reasonably available to the complainant in the circumstances in which
it is situated” must be exhausted***.

According to Claimant, the rule provides that only effective remedies, i.e., those
providing a reasonable possibility of an effective remedy, must be exhausted and such
effectiveness is to be assessed in light of the circumstances in advance of resorting to
the remedy (ex ante), rather than in light of the actual outcome of the case and in light
of the nature of the violation the remedy is aimed at correcting**?.

Secondly, only those remedies which can reasonably be demanded from the investor
are to be exhausted. In the present arbitration, the remedies available to Lion were
neither effective nor reasonable**°:

- Lion’s secured returns on its investments were declining every day and Lion
would never be made whole because the Debtors’ indebtedness continued to
grow and exceeded the value of the collateral;

- Pursuing the Remand Amparo would have been unreasonably inefficient and
would likely have taken more than three additional years.

C. Denial of justice for undue delay does not require exhaustion

Claimant invokes the ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection to state that under
customary international law, local remedies do not need to be exhausted when there is
undue delay in obtaining justice and this delay may be attributed to the Host State**!.

Lion therefore submits that its denial of justice for undue delay claim is exempted from
the exhaustion requirement**”.

MEXICO’S POSITION

Mexico avers that Lion was not denied access to justice as it was given proper
opportunity to be heard and to exercise its right of defense (2.1.). Additionally, there
was no unreasonable delay in the Courts’ proceedings (2.2.). Even if the Tribunal finds
that Lion was denied justice, its claim should fail as it did not comply with the
exhaustion of local remedies requirement (2.3.). Finally, Mexico presents a list of
preliminary objections to Lion’s claims (2.4.).

ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

RESPONDENT FULLY ACCORDED CLAIMANT PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS

Respondent argues that Lion was neither denied access to justice (A.) nor barred from
defending its case and presenting documents to support it (B.).

A. Mexico’s judiciary did not deny Claimant the opportunity to be heard

According to Mexico, Claimant’s allegations that the Juez de lo Mercantil failed to
properly serve it are mistaken**:

First, Mexico is also a victim of the Forged Settlement Agreement™*. The actuario
had no reason to doubt the authenticity of the Forged Settlement Agreement. Under
Mexican law, a Judge has the obligation to verify that the document that serves as the
basis for the legal action is compliant, but the Judge lacks power to question its
authenticity***. According to Respondent, Claimant has provided no evidence to
suggest that the Juez knew or should have known that the contact information was
false*“°. Claimant also ignores the fact that the Juez had no prima facie reason not to
rely on the documentation before him**’.

Second, the actuario’s duty is limited to making sure “that service takes place at the
domicile provided by the claimant”***. In this case:

- The actuario performed service at the address identified by the plaintiff; this
service was directed at the legal representative of Lion, as confirmed by the
actuario*?,

- On the first attempt of service, dated 3 April, 2012, the actuario left a citation
with Lic. Lopez Medina ordering the legal representative to be present at a
specified date and time to facilitate service; given the legal representative’s
absence, the emplazamiento could be effectuated upon any individual present at
the time — in this case, it was Lic. Lopez Medina, who was also identified in the
Settlement Agreement as authorized to receive notification on behalf of
Claimant***

The emplazamiento was correct: according to the Supreme Court, the emplazamiento
has to be performed with the legal representative**! and, if this is not possible, the

actuario simply has to ask for the legal representative before performing service upon
any other person present at the moment**?.

B. Claimant was accorded the right to exercise means of defense

First, if anyone is to be blamed for the Forged Settlement Agreement never being
scrutinized by the judicial system in Mexico, it is Lion, whose negligence was the
reason why the Courts could not admit the additional evidence***: Claimant should
have included references to the alleged fraud in its original Amparo claim, rather than
seeking to introduce them through the ampliacién de demanda ***.

Having failed to include fraud issues, the Juez de Distrito followed the law when it
adjudicated a claim for improper notification (“falta de emplazamiento”) rather than a
claim for forgery***. Therefore, the Juez de Distrito was bound to deliver the judgment
that it did and Lion cannot claim a denial of justice due to its own negligence in
pursuing its claims.

In its decision to dismiss the ampliacion de demanda, the Secretario del Juzgado de
Distrito acted in accordance with local law, which did not require him to grant Lion an
opportunity to cure its procedural defects*°°. It was Lion who failed to demonstrate the
necessary link between its claim and the Forged Settlement Agreement*>’.

When Claimant disagreed with the Juez de Distrito’s decision, it exercised its right to
challenge it through a review proceeding, but lost*** due to one more failure to follow
procedural law: the ampliacién de demanda must be signed either by the aggrieved
party or by its legal representative**’. Lion does not appear to contest the fact that it
filed its ampliacién de demanda improperly*”. Therefore, it was not denied the right
to present evidence and defend its case.

Second, the Juez de Distrito in the Remand Amparo did not dismiss all of Lion’s
evidence, but rather explained that some of it was already on the Court’s record**!; in
any event, the Juez de Distrito was not empowered to admit new evidence in respect

of the authenticity of the Forged Settlement Agreement in the Remand Amparo and
acted in complete accordance with applicable procedural rules*™.

In conclusion, Claimant cannot claim that the decisions to dismiss the additional
evidence were the result of an idiosyncratic or arbitrary decision*®*. By failing to follow
the applicable procedural rules, Lion and not Mexico is responsible for Lion’s inability
to present evidence and defend its case before Mexico’s Courts.

MEXICO’S COURTS DECIDED LION’S CLAIMS WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME

Respondent claims that the duration of each of the stages of the Amparo Proceeding
was reasonable*™*;

- First, the Amparo Proceedings took one year to complete, which constitutes an
appropriate time given its multiple complexities*”;

- Second, the proceedings before the Tribunal de Queja took 16 months to
complete, which once again was a justifiable time given the extraordinary
complexities involved in it*°;

- Third, the Juez de Distrito had only started analysing the Remand Amparo and
cannot be blamed for not delivering a decision due to Claimant’s premature
withdrawal from the proceedings*”’.

Mexico avers that Claimant still had one or two years of litigation ahead had it chosen
to continue, which would not constitute an unusual time given the complexity of the
case**, Additionally, Lion is equally responsible for any delay as it waited for four

years to initiate the Juicio Hipotecario*™™.

There is nothing in the duration of the proceedings that amounts to a wilful disregard
of due process of law, which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.
Thus, the duration of the local proceedings does not meet the threshold of a denial of
justice through unreasonable delay*”.

Award

LION FAILED TO EXHAUST LOCAL REMEDIES

Mexico asserts that Lion did not comply with the requirement of the local remedies
tule as it did not exhaust all available remedies (A.) and no futility exception is
applicable (B.).

A. Claimant did not exhaust all available local remedies

Respondent says that Claimant is improperly using the current arbitration as an appeal
of the Amparo judgment in lieu of Mexico’s domestic legal system>”!.

According to Mexico, international law accords the judiciary a greater presumption of
regularity and requires a claimant to exhaust local remedies before initiating a denial
of justice claim. Otherwise, the host State’s judicial system would not have an
opportunity to correct itself?”.

Respondent avers that Claimant did not exhaust all available local remedies: it could
have and should have initiated a nulidad de juicio concluido proceeding and it has also
not exhausted the criminal proceedings*”*.

Additionally, Respondent emphasizes that a denial of justice may only occur with
regard to a State’s entire judicial system and not separate judicial acts*”*; a claim of
denial of justice can only be based on adjudicative measures that are final. Since
Claimant has not exhausted all available options of seeking recourse under Mexican

law, it is barred from pursuing a denial of justice claim*”.

B. The futility exceptions to the exhaustion rule does not find application in
the current case

According to Mexico, the futility standard is high and is not met here*”°. Instances of
ineffectiveness and futility include situations where*”’:

- the local Courts have no jurisdiction over the dispute;

- the local Courts are notoriously lacking in independence;

- the local Courts do not have the competence to grant an appropriate and adequate
remedy; and

- the absence of an adequate system of judicial protection.

351. There has been no suggestion by Claimant of a lack of jurisdiction or independence or
incompetence or inadequate judicial protection. In fact, Claimant was in the process of
seeking remedy through the Remand Amparo when it prematurely and unnecessarily
withdrew from the proceedings*”*.

352. Mexico argues that Lion failed to prove that there was an unavailability of obtaining
recourse pursuant to Apotex, and instead simply abandoned local proceedings based on
its perceived low likelihood of being granted its desired relief*”’.

3.4. LION IS BARRED FROM BRINGING ITS CLAIMS

353. Mexico additionally raises a number of preliminary objections to Lion’s claims. These
include:

- Lion is not protected under NAFTA Art. 1105, a rule which, according to
Mexico, applies only to investments but not to investors**°;

- Lion failed to exercise due diligence and made irrational business decisions when
it decided to grant the Loans to the Debtors, when it improvidently extended their
maturities and postponed the decision to foreclose, and when it took the
erroneous decision not to foreclose on the Guadalajara Mortgages**!; and

- Mexico’s Courts were confronted with a sophisticated fraud and acted
appropriately. Additionally, Mexico’s Courts should be excused because there is
no allegation that its Judges acted with an intention of malice, or that their
decisions were impaired by collusion or corruption**?.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

In the following section, the Tribunal will briefly analyse and dismiss Respondent’s
preliminary objections (4.1.); then it will establish that Lion was indeed denied justice
by Mexico’s judiciary, in breach of NAFTA Art. 1105 (4.2.), and thereafter dismiss
Mexico’s counterargument that Lion failed to exhaust available and reasonable local
remedies (4.3.).

RESPONDENT’S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION

The Tribunal will first address Mexico’s preliminary objections (summarized in section
3.4. supra):

NAFTA Art. 1105 protects investments and investors

Mexico’s first argument is based on a literal reading of Art. 1105 of NAFTA, which
provides that Mexico “shall accord to investments of investors” of the other treaty
Parties treatment in accordance with international law, including FET and FPS.
Respondent says that Art. 1105 only extends protection to investments, but not to
investors**>,

Contrary to Mexico’s submission, the Tribunal finds that NAFTA Art. 1105 does
indeed grant protection to Lion as an investor.

The FTC Interpretation Note equates the standard of protection to be applied under Art.
1105 of the NAFTA with the standard of “customary international law minimum
standard of treatment of aliens”. The reference to “aliens”, in a context of investment
protection, can only mean investors. A multitude of NAFTA Tribunals have also
construed Art. 1105 as a source of protection for investors rather than solely for their
investments**4.

Lack of due diligence and irrational business decisions

The Tribunal is also unconvinced by Respondent’s argument that Lion failed to
exercise due diligence and made irrational business decisions.

When Lion took the business decision to grant various short-term loans to bridge
finance the acquisition of certain real estate Claimant, it was already a seasoned
investor in Mexico. To secure its rights, Claimant engaged Mexican counsel and
formalized the transaction in the instruments which, under Mexican law, grant creditors
the maximum level of legal certainty: pagarés and hipotecas. Mexico has failed to draw
the Tribunal’s attention to any other action (bar abstaining from investing in Mexico)

which Claimant could have taken to improve its contractual rights and facilitate
enforcement through the Courts.

The business decisions impugned by the Respondent were largely prior to the
involvement of the Mexican courts. They form part of the factual and legal matrix
submitted to the jurisdiction of the Mexican courts, and irrespective of the wisdom of
these decisions (when viewed with hindsight) the Claimant was entitled to the
protection of its rights by the Mexican courts in accordance with Mexican law.

Claimant cannot be blamed for its decision to negotiate with Sr. Cardenas before
launching a Court action to enforce the Mortgages. It was within Lion’s discretion
either, to try to reach an amicable solution with Sr. Cardenas, or to seek foreclosure on
the Guadalajara Properties. The relevant issue in the present case is whether Lion could
effectively avail itself of the protection it was entitled to under Mexican law, if it opted
to enforce the Mortgages.

The case law invoked by Mexico is inapposite***.

Fraud as an excuse

Finally, Respondent invites the Tribunal to take into account the contextual factors of
the case which include**°

- the existence of an alleged multi-level sophisticated fraud, and

- the absence of allegation that the Mexican judiciary acted with an intention of
malice, collusion, corruption, or flagrant abuse of judicial procedure.

Respondent avers that its Courts acted appropriately in the circumstances they faced*®”

and that they (like Claimant) also fell victim to Sr. Cardenas’s fraudulent scheme.

The Tribunal concurs with Mexico that the evidence marshalled in this case supports
the conclusion that Sr. Cardenas and the Debtors engaged in a sophisticated fraud,
which resulted in the cancellation of the Mortgages in the Registro Ptblico. But the
existence of a fraud, however sophisticated, does not excuse the respondent State from
its duty to have a properly functioning judicial system:

- Any proper judicial system must have robust safeguards, which minimize the risk
that aliens are not properly notified of procedures filed against them, and that in

The MTD vy. Chile tribunal explicitly dealt with a situation where the claimants’ lack of diligence consisted

in that they failed to “protect themselves contractually”; in cases Churchill Mining and Renée Rose Levy the
tribunals decided that the BIT could not protect against usual business risks or their unwise business decisions.

Award

absentia judgements against aliens are only adopted, when the Court is satisfied
that the aliens have been properly notified and are aware that they are being sued;

- A properly functioning judicial system must avoid that false information
maliciously provided to the Courts is used, without proper review, to the
detriment of an unsuspecting third parties;

- Finally, the judicial system must offer effective solutions for situations when the
falsehood of the party-provided information is detected once a judgment to the
detriment of the alien has been rendered; in such cases, the system must facilitate
that the aggrieved third party can make allegations and present evidence to
overturn the wrongful judgement.

The Tribunal’s finding that Lion has indeed suffered a denial of justice is based on the
premise that the Mexican judicial system, in particular, the Courts of Jalisco, have
failed to function properly, to the detriment of Lion, a protected investor under NAFTA
(as will be further discussed in section 4.2. infra).

The Tribunal acknowledges that Lion is not alleging that Mexico’s Courts acted in bad
faith to the detriment of an alien, nor that they colluded with the fraudsters nor that the
judicial decisions were tainted by corruption. The Tribunal will consequently accept as
proven that the Mexican judicial system acted in good faith, without colluding with Sr.
Cardenas or the Debtors, and without any impairment by corruption. That said, the
Tribunal has already established that a finding of bad faith, is not required to make an
adjudication for denial of justice (see section 1.3D supra).

DENIAL OF JUSTICE

The starting point of any analysis of denial of justice must be an acknowledgement that
in this area the Tribunal’s powers are subject to strict limitations: the Tribunal is not a
municipal Court of appeal; it should pay deference to decisions as to the merits properly
adopted by municipal Courts, and should offer such Courts a wide margin of
appreciation before the threshold of denial of justice is trespassed. The Tribunal also
identifies with the presumption, set forth in Chevron, that municipal Courts have acted
properly unless Claimant proves otherwise***.

In sum, the Tribunal accepts and supports the finding that the standard for a finding of
denial of justice is high, and that Claimant must prove, to the Tribunal satisfaction, that
the municipal Courts incurred in an improper and egregious procedural conduct which
does not meet the basic internationally accepted standards of administration of justice
and due process, and which shocks or surprises the sense of judicial propriety**’.

ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

Applying this high standard, the Tribunal is persuaded that Lion was indeed denied
procedural justice in three respects:

- Lion was denied access to justice: Lion was, without its fault, never given the
opportunity to defend itself in the Cancellation Proceeding (A.);

- Lion was also denied the right to appeal the Cancellation Judgement: the Juez de
lo Mercantil, the same authority who had rendered the Cancellation Judgment,
adopted a subsequent decision, at the request of the Debtor, giving res iudicata
effect (causar estado) to the Cancellation Judgement and preclosing any
opportunity of appeal (B.);

- Lion was also denied the right to allege in the Amparo Proceeding that the Forged
Settlement Agreement had indeed been forged and to present evidence to prove
this claim: three years into the Amparo Proceeding the forgery claim had still not
been admitted within the Amparo Proceeding (C.).

A. Lion was denied access to justice

Lion, a Canadian corporation with corporate domicile in Dallas, Texas*”’, was never
properly notified that it was being sued in the Cancellation Proceeding, which the
Debtors had filed before the Juez de lo Mercantil in Jalisco, requesting the cancellation
of the Mortgages. Being unaware of these Proceedings, Lion failed to appear before
the Juez and failed to submit a defense. As a result, the Juez declared Lion en rebeldia,
and without any further effort to ascertain whether Lion was aware of the Proceedings,
issued the Cancellation Judgement in absentia, mandating that the Mortgages be
forthwith cancelled.

The Cancellation Proceeding was procedurally faulty — Lion was never properly
notified; and the consequences of the defective notification were devastating to its case.
The conduct of the Juez de lo Mercantil by itself does not amount to a denial of justice.
What is relevant, however, is that the Mexican judiciary never corrected this situation,
despite multiple opportunities to do so at Lion’s request.

The Tribunal will first summarize the Parties’ positions (a.), the proven facts (b.) and
the applicable law (c.) and then analyse why the conduct of the Juez de lo Mercantil is
the basis of the denial of justice (d.).

ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

a. Position of the Parties

Lion claims that it was denied access to justice by Mexico’s courts — it was never
notified of the Cancellation Lawsuit and thus never participated in it, and as a
consequence was declared en rebeldia without fault.

This was due to the actuario not performing basic diligence in the service*”! and the
Juez de lo Mercantil sanctioning the faulty emplazamiento despite the applicable law
requiring that he examine de oficio y de manera exhaustiva whether the defendant was
duly served**?.

Mexico responds by stating that nothing in the actuario’s service or the actions of the
Juez de lo Mercantil was irregular. Both adhered to the standards prescribed by the
applicable State and Federal Mexican law>®

Respondent says the actuario duly confirmed that the address indicated in the basis for
the service (cifatorio) was the same as the one in the notice of service**. The actuario
additionally relied on the representation of Mr. Lopez Medina that the address was
Lion’s actual place of business and that he was authorized to receive notice on Lion’s
behalf**>. These two elements of the actuario’s conduct satisfy the level of scrutiny
required by the applicable law*”°.

In any event, even if the Tribunal were to find irregularities in the emplazamiento or
declaracion en rebeldia, these would not be sufficient for a finding of denial of justice
as recourse from the decision of the Juez de lo Mercantil was available to Claimant,
which it did pursue*”

b. Facts

The Tribunal will summarize the facts that underlie the denial of access to justice to
Lion by Mexico’s Courts.

On April 3, 2012 the actuario (a court officer of the Juez de lo Mercantil) attempted a
first service of process [the “emplazamiento”] at the address identified in clause 7 of
the Forged Settlement Agreement. The service attempt was made on Lic. José Isaac
Lopez Medina*”’, one of the two lawyers identified in the Forged Agreement*”’, who

apparently had his office at that address. There is no evidence that Lion at any time had
an office or other type of establishment at that address, or that it had ever had any
business or professional relationship with Lic. Lopez Medina.

Confronted by the actuario, Lic. Lopez Medina formally declared that no legal
representative of Lion was present in his office in order to receive the emplazamiento
(a statement which evidently was true, Lic. Lopez Medina himself never having had
any power of attorney to represent Lion and no other director or representative of Lion
being present). Upon receipt of this representation, the actuario withdrew, announcing
that he would return the next day. There is no evidence that Lic. Lopez Medina ever
informed Lion of these facts.

At that second visit, which occurred next day, again no legal representative of Lion
was present, since Lion was totally unaware of these occurrences in Jalisco. This being
so, the actuario decided to make the emplazamiento against Lion through a notificacion
por cédula delivered to the person who was at the address, Lic. Lopez Medina*°.

Lic. Lopez Medina accepted the emplazamiento and received a copy of the judicial file
(“autos”). In the emplazamiento the actuario informed Lion that it had a 15-day period
to appear before the Juez de lo Mercantil and submit its defense, and that if it failed to
do so it would be held en rebeldia*”'.

There is no evidence that Lic. Lopez Medina, with whom Lion had no relationship*”,
ever informed Lion that he had accepted the emplazamiento. Lion never received the
emplazamiento*®?, and being unaware that a Court procedure against it was pending
before the Juez de lo Mercantil of Jalisco, it inevitably failed to appear within the
statutory time-limit.

The consequence of this failure was that six weeks thereafter, on May 22, 2012, Lion
was declared en rebeldia by the Juez de lo Mercantil through notification via boletin
judicial*™ (a judicial bulletin)’. Since Lion was not in the habit of reviewing the
boletines judiciales in Jalisco, nor required to do so, it was completely unaware that it
had been declared en rebeldia.

Two weeks after the declaration en rebeldia, on June 6, 2012 the Debtors submitted
their evidence before the Juez de lo Mercantil, including the Mortgage deeds and

Claimant’s expert explains that while the Commerce Code as well Mexico’s procedural codes and statutes

provide for different methods of emplazamiento, including through boletin judicial and estrados, for the initial
notification of a defendant, only personal service is legally accepted, see Zamora I, para. 142 and footnotes
therein. This is not disputed by Mexico.

Minutes of the General Shareholders Meeting of C&C Capital. All the evidence
marshalled by the Debtors was admitted six days later, on June 12, 2012*°°.

Although some of these documents mentioned that Lion was a foreign company
domiciled in the United States*°’, this information seems to have been overlooked or
disregarded by the Juez de lo Mercantil, because he never made any attempt to notify
Lion at any other address. All further communications of the Juez de lo Mercantil —
including the final judgment — were simply affixed to the estrados (notice board), and
Lion was presumed to have been properly notified*°*.

Just two weeks after the submission of evidence, on June 27, 2012 the Juez de lo
Mercantil, acting solely on the basis of the evidence marshalled by the Debtors, and
without any participation of Lion, declared the Loans totalling USD 32.85 M settled
and ordered Lion to cancel the Mortgages and return the Notes through the Cancellation
Judgment*”. From the filing of the Cancellation Lawsuit to the rendering of the
Cancellation Judgment, only 170 days had lapsed.

Both Parties’ legal experts agreed at the Hearing that this constituted an unusually short
duration*!?,

ce Law

The Tribunal has already made findings on the nature of denial of justice and the
standard that needs to be applied to the facts to decide whether a denial of justice
occurred.

First, the Tribunal reiterates its view that denial of justice is always procedural*!!.
Secondly, the Tribunal has also established that denial of access to justice is considered
denial of justice in its purest form and is a universally accepted type of this international
wrong*!?. The case law and scholarly writings acknowledge that access to justice is
impaired when a party is not notified of a proceeding that involves its rights and it is
prevented from being heard by the local Courts.

Paparinskis recalls that*!>

“[...] the absence of notification about proceedings that exclude the possibility to
challenge them could all result in denial of justice”.

395. The Ambatielos decision also recognizes this basic rule of administration of justice*'*
“[...] the foreigner shall enjoy full freedom to appear before the courts for the

protection or defence of his rights, whether as plaintiff or defendant; to bring any
action provided or authorized by law [.

 

396. Thirdly, based on the opinions of international scholars and the decisions of investment
tribunals, the Tribunal has adopted the prevailing test: a positive finding of denial of
justice requires an improper and egregious procedural conduct by the local courts
(whether intentional or not), which does not meet the basic international accepted
standards of administration of justice and due process, and which shocks or surprises
the sense of judicial propriety.

d. Discussion

397. Ina judicial proceeding, a basic principle of natural justice requires that the defendant,
who is being sued, is properly notified of the terms of the claims, and is afforded the
opportunity to appear before the Court, to rebut these claims, to make allegations and
to present evidence.

398. Lion never knew that the Debtors had filed the Cancellation Proceeding against it
before the Juez de lo Mercantil in Jalisco, and was denied the opportunity to make
allegations or present evidence in that Procedure. It was not the Court, but rather third
parties, which informed Lion about the existence of the Cancellation Proceeding, after
the Cancellation Judgement had been rendered and had become res iudicata.

A deeply flawed emplazamiento
399. The emplazamiento performed on behalf of the Juez de lo Mercantil was deeply flawed.

400. The actuario served Lion por cédula, i.e., via a notification which is not given directly
to the respondent, but which can simply be handed to a defendant’s relatives,
employees or domestic helper*!>.

401. Lion’s expert opines that such service requires a higher degree of certainty than
ordinary service, with the actuario having to ascertain that the person served is actually
at the defendant’s domicile, and that such person maintains one of the legally
established categories of relationship with the defendant*!®.

402. Mexico’s expert admits that according to the applicable law, confirmation of service
by the actuario should explain the reason that led the Juez to be certain that the
defendant factually resides in the place service is to be made*!’.

403. The rules to be applied to the emplazamiento of Lion were enshrined in Arts. 112*!®
and 112 bis*!? of the CPC Jalisco*”°,

404. The general rule is contained in Art. 112 CPC: The emplazamiento must be done
personally on the respondent (“se realiza personalmente con el demandado’”); if the
respondent is not present when the actuario arrives, a new visit is scheduled for the
next day, and if the respondent is still absent, a notificacion por cédula is admissible.

405. Art. 112 bis CPC the regulates the requirements for a valid notificacién por cédula.
The cédula can be delivered to a relative, an employee or to any person found at the
domicile, subject to a specific requirement: the actuario must verify that the defendant
has at such domicile its principal place of business (“después de que el notificador se
hubiere cerciorado [...] de que es el principal asiento de sus negocios”).

406. The emplazamiento performed on Lic. Lopez Medina by the actuario does not satisfy
this legal standard: it is clear from the minutes of service filed by the actuario that he
failed to obtain any evidence that could corroborate that the domicile set-forth in the
Forged Settlement Agreement (that is, that “‘nuimero 95, despacho 7, de la calle Tomas
V. Gomez, Colonia Ladron de Guevara (Guadalajara, Jalisco”) was indeed “e/
principal asiento de los negocios” of Lion LLC, a Canadian incorporated company). It
is specially telling that the actuario failed to challenge Lic. Lopez Medina’s authority,
and never requested that the lawyer present any evidence linking himself to Lion.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

Mexico’s experts argue that the actuario was not obliged to verify the authenticity of
the documents serving as the basis for service, and that he did not have the power to do
so*?!. However, another of Mexico’s experts accepted at the Hearing that the actuario
has authority to verify the address for the emplazamiento*. Thus, it is clear that the
mechanical checking of whether the address matches that in the citatorio is not
sufficient to meet the standard required of the actuario under the CPC Jalisco.

Moreover, the citatorio, which served as the basis for the address for notification,
contains a discrepancy in the office number, when compared with the address provided
in the Forged Settlement Agreement:

- The Forged Settlement Agreement stated that the address was “numero 95,
despacho 7, de la calle Tomas V. Gémez, Colonia Ladrén de Guevara
(Guadalajara, Jalisco)”*”.

- The citatorio indicated office (“despacho)” 5, rather than the despacho 7**.

A deeply flawed declaracion en rebeldia

But not only the actuario failed to fulfil its task to ascertain that the emplazamiento
was proper, so did also the Juez de lo Mercantil, who was required to scrutinize whether
the emplazamiento had been completed without irregularities, before declaring Lion en
rebeldia.

Under Mexican law, the effects of being en rebeldia are draconian: the procedure
continues, without the participation of the person declared in default; furthermore the
defendant is declared confeso; i.e. he/she is legally presumed to have accepted the facts
as averred in the counterparty’s claim*?>. Based on such presumption, the Juez de lo
Mercantil eventually would accept, without further inquiries, the truthfulness of the
Forged Settlement Agreement and order its specific performance, including the
cancellation of the Mortgages.

This is the reason why Art. 279 CPC requires the Juez de lo Mercantil to examine the
legality of the service of process before issuing the declaracién en rebeldia:

“Trascurrido el término del emplazamiento sin haber sido contestada la demanda,
se hard la declaracién de rebeldia y se observaran las prescripciones del capitulo
I del Titulo Décimo Segundo de este Codigo. Para hacer la declaracién de
rebeldia, el juez inara de oficio y de manera exhaustiva si las citaci

por este codigo caso contrario, debera reponer el imi sin
esperar al dictado de la sentencia.” [Emphasis added]

The rule could not be clearer: before declaring respondent en rebeldia, the Judge must
examine ex officio and exhaustively (“de manera exhaustiva”) whether the
emplazamiento has been properly performed.

There is no indication in the case file*”®, of the Juez de lo Mercantil having performed
any scrutiny with regard to the emplazamiento, let alone “examining [it] in an
exhaustive manner”. The Juez mechanically corroborated and accepted that the service
had been properly completed by his actuario, and did not take any additional measure
to verify that the respondent had been properly notified and was actually aware that it
was being sued in Jalisco.

The omission is especially shocking, because the Cancellation Proceeding was not a
minor case, but rather a complex procedure, which pitched a group of well-known local
companies against a US-based corporation, which affected well-known and highly
valuable pieces of real estate located within the State of Jalisco and which could result
(and indeed resulted) in the cancellation of multi-million USD Mortgages granted in
favour of the US creditor. Under these circumstances the Judge should have double-
checked “de manera exhaustiva” that the respondent had been properly notified.

With a minimum of diligence, the Juez de lo Mercantil could and should have realized
that Lion was a foreign company that needed to be served internationally. The
information available to the Juez de lo Mercantil included:

- Lion’s denomination, “LP”, which does not correspond to any incorporation
under Mexican law*?’;

- A certified copy of the Nayarit Mortgage, where the actual domicile of Lion was
specified to be in the US*8;

- Certified copies of the Guadalajara Mortgages, which state that Lion was a
company constituted in conformity with the laws of Quebec, Canada*”;

- The mortgages included as attachments to the Loans, which explicitly state that
Lion’s domicile is in the US*”.

- The Minutes of the Shareholders’ Meeting of C&C Capital and Inmobiliaria
Bains, which also stated that Lion was a legal entity constituted pursuant to the
laws of Quebec, Canada**!

The omission to verify whether the respondent had been properly notified was
exacerbated when subsequent procedural steps and decisions were simply notified by
means of a noticeboard in the courthouse. No additional effort was ever made, to
ascertain whether Lion was aware of the developments within the Cancellation
Proceeding***. Lion was kept completely in the dark.

The lack of any diligence reached its zenith, when the Juez de lo Mercantil issued a
default judgment, fully accepting the Debtors’ claims. No attempt was made to
ascertain that Claimant was duly informed of the decision, and of its right to lodge an
appeal.

Case law

The Tribunal observes the similarity of the current facts with those in Cotesworth &
Powell, where the tribunal decided that claimants had been denied justice because of
the failure of the judge to summon the absent creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding and
later also failing to notify them of the sentence of classification***. The net result was
the same: the creditors were unable to participate in a proceeding in the same way that
Lion was not given the opportunity to appear before the Juez de lo Mercantil.

Similarities may also be drawn between the situation in Jdler, where the US-Mexico
Claims Commission found a denial of the US plaintiffs access to justice, when he was
notified of the upcoming hearing in Venezuela with insufficient time left for him to
make the necessary travel to appear in court**4. Lion was likewise given a formalistic
notice to appear — on the estrados notice board in the State of Jalisco — which in fact
amounted to a lack of effective notification. The end result is the same: an impediment
to the aggrieved alien to appear before the local Court and defend its rights.

Finally, Lion’s exclusion from the proceedings was exacerbated by the unusual
swiftness of the Cancellation Proceeding. Both Parties’ legal experts agreed at the
Hearing that the 170 days that it took from the filing of the Cancellation Lawsuit to the
rendering of the Cancellation Judgment constituted an unusually short duration**.

Applying the established legal standard, the Tribunal finds that depriving Lion of its
right to appear before the Juez de lo Mercantil through a severely irregular

emplazamiento and declaracién en rebeldia amounts to an improper and egregious
procedural conduct by the local courts, which does not meet the basic international
accepted standards of administration of justice and due process, and which shocks or
surprises the sense of judicial propriety.

As will be analysed in the following sections, the Mexican judiciary never corrected
this wrong, despite Lion’s numerous requests to the judiciary to do so.

B. Lion was also denied the right to appeal the Cancellation Judgement

Once the Cancellation Judgement had been rendered, the Debtor approached the Juez
de lo Mercantil (the same who had rendered the Cancellation Judgment), and alleging
spurious arguments requested that the Juez give res iudicata effect (causar estado) to
the Cancellation Judgement. The Juez did so, and barred any possibility of Lion, once
it became aware of the Cancellation Judgement, to lodge an appeal.

The decision of the Juez de lo Mercantil, granting res iudicata status to the Cancellation
Judgement, also constitutes a denial of justice.

The Tribunal will again apply a fourfold discussion comprising the Party positions (a.),
the proven facts (b.) and the applicable law (c.) and an analysis of why the causar
estado ruling by the Juez de lo Mercantil is another component of Mexico’s Courts’
actions amounting to denial of justice (d.).

a. Position of the Parties

Claimant says that, as with the Cancellation Proceeding, it was not properly served
with the Cancellation Judgment*°. On August 8, 2012 the Juez de lo Mercantil
declared that Claimant had no right to appeal the Cancellation Judgment*” and, upon
the Debtors request, issued an order to the Public Registries of Nayarit and Jalisco to
cancel the Mortgages***.

Respondent does not offer any argumentation purporting to justify the Juez’s decision.
b. Facts

On June 27, 2012 the Juez de lo Mercantil, acting solely on the basis of the evidence
marshalled by the Debtors, and without any participation of Lion, issued the

Cancellation Judgement, declaring the Loans settled and ordering Lion to cancel the
Mortgages and return the Notes**?.

Award

A few weeks thereafter, on August 8, 2012, and at the request of the Debtors, the Juez
de lo Mercantil declared that the Cancellation Judgement “causa estado por ministerio
de la ley”, i.e. that it has become res iudicata, there being no possibility of submitting
a recurso de apelacion. The reason given by the Judge for his decision precluding any
further appeal was that the amount claimed in the procedure was less than MEX
500,000 (approximately USD 25,000)”.

  

On August 30, 2012 the Juez de lo Mercantil ordered specific performance of the
Cancellation Judgement, and instructed the Registro Ptiblico of Jalisco to cancel the
Guadalajara Mortgages“! and that of Nayarit to do the same with the Nayarit
Mortgage*”. The Registro Publico of Jalisco did so on September 7, 2012*. The
cancellation of the Nayarit Mortgage was recorded on October 19, 2012*4#. Upon these
registrations, all three Mortgages became extinct for all legal purposes.

ec. The law

The Tribunal reiterates that denial of justice is always procedural and the test for denial
of justice established by the Tribunal under Section VI.1.1.3D above, which remains
applicable for the second analysis of facts: improper and egregious procedural conduct
by the local courts (whether intentional or not), which does not meet the basic
international accepted standards of administration of justice and due process, and
which shocks or surprises the sense of judicial propriety.

Since the second denial of justice pondered by the Tribunal concerns the arbitrary
closing of an avenue of appeal that was otherwise guaranteed to it by the law, the
conduct of the Juez de lo Mercantil falls under the same type of wrong as the deeply
flawed emplazamiento: denying Lion access to justice.

The Hague Texts similarly remind that an international wrong occurs when***:

“the foreigner has been hindered by the judicial authorities in the exercise of his
right to pursue judicial remedies”.

In the same vein, the tribunal in Krederi observed that one of the serious defects in the
adjudicative process may take the form of a violation of

“[...] the right to be heard and to present evidence”

In analysing whether Lion was denied access to justice through the causar estado ruling
by the Juez de lo Mercantil, the same scholarly writing and case law find application
as those cited under Section VI.1.1.2A, supra.

d. Discussion

The decision of the Juez de lo Mercantil to grant estado to the Cancellation Judgment
was deeply flawed.

Under Mexican law, commercial cases of the first instance are subject to appeal. The
Commercial Code of Mexico states the following:

“Articulo 1336.- Se llama apelacion el recurso que se interpone para que el tribunal
superior confirme, reforme o revoque las resoluciones del inferior que puedan ser
impugnadas por la apelacidn, en los términos que se precisan en los articulos
siguientes.

Articulo 1337.- Pueden apelar de una sentencia:
I. El litigante condenado en el fallo, si creyere haber recibido algtin agravio [...]”

The Commercial Code of Mexico foresees an exception to the general rule, when the
value of the dispute is below the threshold of MEX 500,000, adjusted yearly for
inflation’:

“Articulo 1340. La apelacion no procede en juicios mercantiles cuando por su
monto se ventilen en los juzgados de paz o de cuantia menor, o cuando el monto
sea inferior a [MEX 500,000] por concepto de suerte principal, debiendo
actualizarse dicha cantidad en los términos previstos en el articulo 1339.”

The Juez de lo Mercantil offers no reasoning as to how he reached the conclusion that
the value of the Cancellation Proceeding equalled less than MEX 500,000.

Instead, he automatically accepted the Debtors’ request, despite two types of evidence
before him demonstrating the obviously superior value of the dispute: the Promissory
Notes and the Mortgage deeds. The decision is difficult to understand, because the
principal amount of the Loans settled and Mortgages terminated amounted to tens of
millions of USD.

 

“7 Exh, CLA- 336, Zamora I- 3, p. 136.

“8 Art, 1349 additionally ates: “Cor fala fa de I fa actualizar cada afio por

Even disregarding the value of the Notes (which do not constitute a protected
investment), the Judge had before him the Mortgage deeds, which also contain
references to the value of the Loans, each of which was made for millions of dollars.
The Guadalajara Mortgage 1 deed even contains an equivalent in Mexican pesos, which
amounts to MEX 131,197,200 — circa two hundred and fifty times as much as the
threshold for the possibility to bring appeal.

The Juez de lo Mercantil was well aware of this information. In its own Cancelation
Judgment, the Juez de lo Mercantil acknowledged that the Mortgages had been
established to secure the Loans for a total value of USD 32.8 M***.

The Juez de lo Mercantil thus blatantly failed to follow the procedure set out in the
Commercial Code of Mexico when it granted res iudicata effect to the Cancellation
Judgment. The decision was highly relevant, because Lion was denied the possibility
to appeal the Cancellation Judgment, once again being subjected to the closing of a
legal avenue before even realizing the existence of the Cancellation Proceeding. The
only remaining alternative within the civil Court system was to launch an Amparo.

Applying the relevant test, the Tribunal finds that the decision granting estado effect to
the Cancellation Judgment, patently disregarding the amount in dispute in the
Cancellation Proceeding, and closing one of Lion’s avenues of accessing justice before
local Courts through an otherwise available appeal mechanism, amounts to improper
and egregious procedural misconduct by the local courts, which does not meet the basic
internationally accepted standards of administration of justice and due process, and
which shocks or surprises the sense of judicial propriety.

C. Lion was denied the right to allege and prove the forgery of the Forged
Settlement Agreement

Lion was also denied justice through the local Courts’ consistent denial for Lion to
present material and relevant evidence to effectively defend its case.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

The Tribunal will re-apply the previous structure for its reasoning, beginning with the
Party positions (a.), moving on to the proven facts (b.) and the applicable law (c.) to
finish with an analysis of why Mexico’s Courts deprived Lion of its right to present
evidence and defend its case, thus constituting a denial of justice (d.).

a. Position of the Parties

Lion avers that despite its multiple attempts to do so, Mexican courts barred it from
presenting material and relevant evidence to defend its case in the local proceedings**>.

Lion argues that Mexico’s Courts have denied it the opportunity to prove the forgery.
In Claimant’s view, lack of service is a breach of such a magnitude under Mexican law
that the Juez de Distrito should have allowed all evidence and arguments that are
necessary to prove the circumstances of the allegedly illegal service**° under the
suplencia de la deficiencia de la queja (supplement of the deficiency of the
complaint)**”, yet the Juez de Distrito dismissed any evidence pointing to the falsehood
of the emplazamiento without granting Lion a chance to cure any formal
deficiencies***.

Additionally, none of Mexico’s Courts seized of Lion’s proceedings ruled on the
authenticity of the Forged Settlement Agreement. The Juez de Distrito refused to
decide on the issue**; the Tribunal de Queja also*, ruling that the question should be
resolved after the False Amparo issue was decided in the Remand Amparo; and the
Juez de Distrito*’', understanding that the Tribunal de Queja had excluded from the
admissible evidence the evidence concerning the falsehood of the Forged Settlement
Agreement*”. Ultimately, Lion’s Amparo claim was thus frustrated.

Mexico responds by arguing that Lion was not denied the right to present evidence and
that all prejudice it allegedly suffered is attributable to its own negligent actions.

If anyone is to be blamed for the Forged Settlement Agreement never being scrutinized
by the judicial system in Mexico, it is Lion, whose negligence was the reason why the
Courts could not admit the additional evidence*®: Claimant should have included

references to the alleged fraud in its original Amparo claim, rather than seeking to
introduce them through the ampliacion de demanda *.

456. As Lion failed to include allegations of fraud, the Juez de Distrito followed the law
when it adjudicated a claim for improper notification (“falta de emplazamiento”) rather
than a claim for forgery“. Therefore, the Juez de Distrito was bound to deliver the
judgment that it did and Lion cannot claim a denial of justice due to its own negligence
in pursuing its claims.

457. In its decision to dismiss the ampliacién de demanda, the Secretario del Juzgado de
Distrito acted in accordance with local law, which did not require him to grant Lion an
opportunity to cure its procedural defects**°. It was Lion who failed to demonstrate the
necessary link between its claim and the Forged Settlement Agreement**”.

458. When Claimant disagreed with the Juez de Distrito’s decision, it exercised its right to
challenge it through a review proceeding, but lost*** due to one more failure to follow
procedural law: an ampliacién de demanda must be signed either by the aggrieved
party or by its legal representative”. Lion does not appear to contest the fact that it
filed its ampliacién de demanda improperly*”’. Therefore, it was not denied the right
to present evidence.

459. Additionally, the Juez de Distrito in the Remand Amparo did not dismiss all of Lion’s
evidence, but rather explained that some of it was already on the Court’s record*”!; in
any event, the Juez de Distrito was not empowered to admit new evidence in respect
of the authenticity of the Forged Settlement Agreement in the Remand Amparo and
acted in complete accordance with applicable procedural rules*”*.

460. According to Mexico, Lion cannot claim that the decisions to dismiss the additional
evidence were the result of an idiosyncratic or arbitrary decision*”’. By failing to follow
the applicable procedural rules, Lion is responsible for barring itself from presenting
evidence to defend its case. Therefore, the claim that the Mexican judiciary failed to
grant Claimant the right to defend itself and to present evidence should be rejected.

b. Facts

In the course of the local proceedings, Lion tried on multiple occasions to bring relevant
evidence that could easily prove the illegality of service and justify the annulment of
the Cancellation Judgment. However, the municipal Courts repeatedly denied Lion the
possibility to do so.

Failed ampliacién de demanda

In the Cancellation Judgment of June 27, 2012, the Juez de lo Mercantil, without Lion’s
participation, declared the Loans settled and ordered Lion to cancel the Mortgages and
return the Notes*”. In mid-December 2012, Lion learned about the existence, but not
the details, of the Cancellation Judgment*”*.

Within the 15-day deadline to file an Amparo, the only available effective remedy, Lion
filed its Amparo Lawsuit on December 19, 20124”, to challenge the cancellation of the
Mortgages. Lion did not include any reference to the Forged Settlement Agreement,
because it did not know of its existence: the Forged Agreement was only made known
to Lion when the Juez de lo Mercantil filed an informe (report) in January 201347’.

Thus, Lion’s initial Amparo claim was for improper emplazamiento, a broad category
encompassing different causes, rather than the precise allegation of forgery.

Having obtained access to the Forged Settlement Agreement and the file of the
Cancellation Proceeding, on January 28, 2013478, Lion filed an ampliacién de la
demanda, alleging the illegality of the service performed by the actuario on the basis
of the newly acquired information on the Forged Settlement Agreement*”:

“La falta de emplazamiento legal a la hoy quejosa [i.e. Lion] [...] debido a que
el supuesto emplazamiento [...] se hizo en un domicilio que no es de la hoy
quejosa [...]. Amén de que el supuesto domicilio donde de practicé dicho

- a graphological expert report to prove that the signature in the Forged Agreement
did not belong to Mr. Hendricks, and

- emails between a broker retained by Lion and Sr. Cardenas to demonstrate that,
after the Forged Agreement was supposedly signed in November 2011, Lion and
Sr. Cardenas were still holding discussions on the terms of the repayment of the
Loans.

This procedural step of extending the initial claim to include the (highly relevant)
inauthenticity of the Forged Agreement, would become a stumbling block hindering
the progression of the Amparo Proceeding and leading to its eventual demise.

The first step occurred on January 30, 2013: in a proveido the Secretario del Juzgado
de Distrito in Jalisco dismissed the ampliacién of the Amparo submitted by Lion,
arguing that

“dichos actos ya fueron precisados desde el escrito inicial de demanda’**'
- a plainly wrong statement. The Secretario further admitted some (rather irrelevant)
evidence attached to Lion’s forgery claim, but postponed the decision on the
admissibility of the expert and witness evidence**.

Frustrated by this postponement, Lion brought, on February 6, 2013, an “incidente de

falsedad de documento” before the Juez de Distrito, claiming again that the Forged

Agreement was the result of fraud**?.

On April 10, 2013, the Juez de Distrito stated that he would decide in due course on
the admissibility of the proposed graphological expertise on the authenticity of the
Forged Settlement Agreement***, And on April 19, 2013 the Juez de Distrito once
again decided to postpone his decision on the admissibility of the evidence, because of
a queja proceeding which was subsequently initiated and which will be dealt with in
the next section**.

Dismissal by the Tribunal de Queja

While the decision on the admission of evidence was pending before the Juez de
Distrito, one of the Debtors, C&C Ingenieria, filed as a tercero perjudicado two

quejas**® before the Tribunal de Queja against the Dismissal Proveido issued by the
Secretary of the Court**’ and the April 10, 2013 decision of the Juez de Distrito. C&C
Ingenieria argued that Lion’s ampliacion de demanda was inadmissible, because it had
not been properly signed on Lion’s behalf.

Lion for its part also submitted a queja against the same decision, because it precluded
Lion from claiming that the Forged Settlement Agreement was a forgery and the origin
of the improper service***.

The Tribunal de Queja dismissed Lion’s queja and decided in favour of C&C
Ingenieria: the appeal court ruled that the ampliacion de la demanda, which Lion had
filed, was inadmissible, because it had not been properly signed on behalf of Lion: it
should have been signed by Lion’s legal representative and not by the attorney
empowered by Lion to act on its behalf in the Amparo proceedings**’.

Lion was not given an opportunity to cure the alleged procedural defect, although the
ampliacién de demanda aimed at proving that Lion, an alien company operating in
Mexico, had been the victim of an elaborate fraud to avoid its proper emplazamiento.
This stands in stark contrast with the treatment granted to the complainants when the
False Amparo was submitted without the requisite copies. In that instance, the Juez
accorded the complainants the chance to cure the formalistic deficiency.

Failure of incidente de falsedad de documento

Once the queja had been resolved, the Juez de Distrito resumed his work, and in
accordance with the decision of the Tribunal de Queja resolved that all evidence linked
to the forgery claim should be dismissed (both the evidence already admitted and the
evidence still pending admission)*””.

 

Thereafter the Juez de Distrito rendered a specific ruling on Lion’s separate motion
(“incidente de falsedad de documento”). The judge dismissed it on the grounds that the
allegedly false document (the Forged Settlement Agreement) was not related to the
subject-matter of the Amparo Proceeding*”'.

 

ed in Amparo proceedings are themselves subject to three different challenges:

revisién, queja and reclamacién. In an Amparo indirecto, such as the one file by Lion, the most common
challenges are queja against different procedural orders (specifically those that cause irreparable harm) and
revision against the Amparo court’s final judgment, both of which are decided by a Tribunal Colegiado de
Circuito (Federal Circuit Court), see Zamora I, para. 87.

In so deciding, the Juez de Distrito ignored the principle fraus omnia corrumpit: an

purports to provide the address for service of process and the name of the process agent,
is evidently unlawful, and can never constitute a proper emplazamiento.

Be that as it may, from that date on, the scope of the Amparo did not include any inquiry
into the issue whether the Settlement Agreement had been forged; it was assumed that
the Settlement Agreement was valid and binding, having been properly executed by
Lion. The scope of the Amparo was reduced to the question whether the emplazamiento
had or not been properly executed in accordance with Mexican law. And — congruently
with this reduced scope of investigation — all evidence in the file seeking to prove the
forgery of the Settlement Agreement was expurgated.

Failure to address forgery in Amparo Judgment

On December 4, 2013, the Juez de Distrito delivered the Amparo Judgment denying
Lion protection against the Cancellation Judgment*””.

“[...] RES UEL VE: UNICO. LA JUSTICIA DE LA UNION NO AMPARA
NI PROTEGE A LION MEXICO CONSOLIDATED, L.P., contra los actos que
reclama del JUEZ Y DEL SECRETARIO EJECUTOR, AMBOS ADSCRITOS
AL JUZGADO NOVENO DE LO MERCANTIL DEL PRIMER PARTIDO
JUDICIAL DEL ESTADO DE JALISCO. [...]” [Capitals in the original]

The Amparo Judgement is a 67-page document, which in its “Resu/tando” summarizes
the procedure, and which then reasons the decision in seven “Considerandos”.

As a preliminary question, the Juez de Distrito analyzes Lion’s allegation that on July
6, 2013 Sr. Arechederra’s signature had been forged in the false request for copy before
the Juzgado de lo Mercantil — see section 5.1 supra. (The issue was relevant, because
if it had been true that on July 6, 2013 Lion had been aware of the Cancellation
Judgement, the Amparo would have been inadmissible due to the statute of limitations).

The Amparo Judgement, after weighing the expert and other evidence marshalled by
the parties, concludes that Sr. Arechederra’s signature indeed had been forged, that the
request for copy had indeed been false, and that consequently Lion’s request for
Amparo was not time barred*”?.

The Amparo Judgement also acknowledges that Sr. Arechederra and Lion had filed a
criminal action against Sr. Cardenas, accusing him of having forged his signature on
various documents, and that on 26 September 2013 the criminal judge had ordered the

imprisonment of Sr. Cardenas for this crime. But the Amparo Judge accorded little
weight to this piece of evidence**:

“[EI auto de formal prisién] unicamente constituye un indicio que unido a otras
pruebas, puede coadyuvar a la formacién de prueba plena con las que se
acrediten, en un momento dado, hechos diversos a los aqui demostrados”

Notwithstanding the finding that at least on one occasion Sr. Arechederra’s signature
had been forged, and that Sr. Cardenas was in prison for alleged forgeries of
documents, the Amparo judgement does not even discuss Lion’s argument that the
Settlement Agreement was also forged: since the ampliacién de demanda had been
dismissed (because it had been signed by Lion’s attorney, but not by a legal
representative), any issue relating to the falsehood of the Settlement Agreement was
off limits in the Amparo procedure.

The Amparo Judgement consequently assumes that the Settlement Agreement was
validly executed on Lion’s behalf. There being a valid Settlement Agreement with a
designation of process agent and an address for service of process, the Juez de Distrito
dismisses Lion’s argument that the emplazamiento should have been made in Dallas,
Texas, USA, and in accordance with the applicable international treaties*”>.

Instead, the Juez de Distrito discusses at length a minor incident in the way the
fraudulent emplazamiento had taken place: in accordance with the Settlement
Agreement the notification should have been made at Calle Tomas V. Gomez 95,
despacho 7. But in reality, the actuario went to the same address, but to a different
office: despacho 5.

The Juez de Distrito finds that this “minor defect” does not invalidate the
emplazamiento, because the actuario was able to locate Lic. Lopez Medina, who, in
accordance with the Settlement Agreement, was the person designated by Lion as
process agent*”®. The Judge’s very words are the following*?”:

“De ahi que, aun y cuando aparece que el emplazamiento a juicio de la ahora
quejosa [Lion], se practicé en un domicilio diverso al pactado [...], ello de
ninguna manera acarrea la consecuencia que [Lion] no estuviera enterada [del

 

juicio], en_razén_que la diligencia de a_juicio_se_entendid
pe con_uno de sus autorizados para recibir ier_tipo de

 

comunicaci6n [...]”. [Emphasis added]

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

The argument is straightforward: since the Settlement Agreement must be deemed
valid and binding and Lic. Lopez Medina is Lion’s process agent, the emplazamiento
made to Lic. Lopez Medina, even if at the wrong address, is also valid and binding.

Failure to address forgery in recurso de revision

Lion was not satisfied with the Amparo Judgement. On December 19, 2013 Lion filed
the recurso de revisién, seeking its revocation, the granting of protection to Lion’s
constitutional rights and the finding that the Cancellation Lawsuit and related acts were
null and void*?*.

Among other reasons, Lion explicitly challenged the Amparo Judgment, arguing that
the Juez de Distrito had disregarded Lion’s claim that the Settlement Agreement had
been forged, with the erroneous argument that the falsehood was unrelated to the
dispute and that the defendants in the Amparo had not participated in the alleged
forgery. Lion explained that the falsehood of the Settlement Agreement was indeed
relevant for the Amparo, because Lion’s emplazamiento had been delivered to Lic.
Lopez Medina, Lion’s purported process agent designated in the Settlement
Agreement. If the Settlement Agreement was a forgery, the designation of Lic. Lopez
Medina was false, and the emplazamiento had not been properly made*”?.

Summary of Lion’s efforts to introduce evidence

As outlined above, Lion attempted on multiple occasions to present evidence regarding
the fraudulent character of the Forged Settlement Agreement and was denied at every
attempt.

Lion filed a total of four petitions to submit evidence on the forgery and was denied
the opportunity every single time. It did so in all possible instances:

- On January 28, 2013 Lion filed its ampliacién de la demanda, explaining that the
service made by the Juez de lo Mercantil was based on a forged document and
should thus be deemed inexistent*°°;

- On February 6, 2013, Lion brought an “incidente de falsedad de documento”
before the Juez de Distrito, claiming again that the Forged Agreement was the
result of fraud*"!;

118

Award

- Separately, on February 8, 2013, Lion also submitted a queja against Dismissal
Proveido as precluding it from claiming that the Forged Settlement Agreement
was a forgery*?, and

- On December 19, 2013 as part of its recurso de revision, Lion once again tried
to claim the forgery of the Términos document*®>. However, it was barred from
doing so by the express order of the Tribunal de Queja which forbade the Juez
de Distrito to look into the issue in the Remand Proceeding.

ec. The law

493. The Tribunal has already established that the third type of denial of justice occurs when
municipal Courts prevent an alien from producing evidence to support its case"*.

494. In Cotesworth & Powell the tribunal confirmed that

“[...] refusing to hear the party interested, or to allow him [an] opportunity to
produce proofs, amounts to the same thing as an absolute denial of justice”.
[Emphasis added]

495. The right to present relevant and material evidence in the context of denial of justice
has also been recognized by academia*”>:

“(When discussing procedural guarantees whose violation amounts to denial of
justice] One strand of procedural improprieties related to equality of arms, in
particular regarding the right of aliens to be notified about procedural
developments, the right to be heard, the right to counsel, the right to call and
confront witnesses, the right to produce evidence, and the right to public
proceedings in criminal cases. [...]

[Equality of arms] may also apply regarding matters such as attendance of
hearings, neutrality of the expert, the right to call witnesses, submit evidence, have
the evidence considered by the court, comment on observations, and be informed
about the reasons of challenged decisions.”

d. Discussion

496. The Juez de Distrito saw fit to decide on the correctness of the emplazamiento without
first addressing whether the Settlement Agreement was in fact a forgery, which led to

119

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

rulings that are, in the Tribunal’s view, contradictory***. On July 5, 2013 the Juez de
Distrito decided that the issue of the forgery of the Forged Settlement Agreement was
not related to the subject-matter of the Amparo Proceeding*” and on December 4, 2013
the same Juez de Distrito decided, based on the Forged Settlement Agreement, that the
emplazamiento was performed correctly. The Tribunal finds it logically apparent that
the correctness of the emplazamiento hinges upon the truthfulness of the Settlement
Agreement.

497. In Cotesworth & Powell the international tribunal found multiple denials of justice to

claimants, including an instance of contradictory rulings by the same tribunal:

“That between the sentence of the superior tribunal of March 8, 1861, and that of
April 2, 1862, by the same tribunal, there is a direct and irreconcilable
contradiction. One recognized the authority of the claimant’s attorney to bring
action; the other expressly denied it**”.

498. The Tribunal also finds it surprising that the Juez de Distrito, while explicitly

acknowledging that on September 26, 2013 a criminal judge had ordered the
imprisonment of Sr. Cardenas precisely for the alleged forgery, did not find sufficient
reason to scrutinize the veracity of the Forged Settlement Agreement’.

499. The reasoning behind the refusals to examine the Forged Settlement Agreement was

always purely procedural and concerned minor mistakes by Lion which were curable
— but Lion was never given the opportunity to correct them. The continuing rejections
of Lion’s motions to present evidence on the false character of the Forged Settlement
Agreement were based on dubious formalistic nuances of local procedural law.

500. Lion was blamed for not having alleged forgery in its initial Amparo claim, since

506

Mexico avers that Lion was aware, as of December 17, 2012, that “[a] lawsuit was
simulated, signatures were forged, et cetera*'®”. But it has been proven that Lion did
not have access to the relevant files, which included a copy of the Forged Settlement
Agreement, until mid-January 2013°!! and was pressured by the 15-day time limit to
bring an Amparo from the date of taking notice of the Cancellation Judgment, which
occurred on December 17, 2012°!”. At the moment of filing of the Amparo, Lion simply

The two rulings of the Juez de Distrito contradict each other: on July 5, 2013 the Juez de Distrito decided

that there was: No need to deal with forgery of the Alleged Hendricks Document and on December 4, 2013:
Proper service on the basis of the Alleged Hendricks Document (denying LMC’s Amparo Claim).

knew that a Cancellation Judgment had been rendered in a proceeding of which it was
not aware. The Tribunal finds no error on Claimant’s side.

The Tribunal is further persuaded by Lion’s supported arguments that any formalistic
errors in the filing of submissions were curable and that the Juez de Distrito should
have provided Lion the opportunity to amend them*!>. The failure to grant Lion a
period to cure the formal deficiency stands in stark contrast not only to basic principles
of due process under Mexican law>!*, but also the actions of the Juez del Primer
Distrito, who in the case of the False Amparo allowed a three-day period for the
plaintiff to provide the requires six additional copies of the False Amparo*!>.

Lion further avers that lack of service amounts to a fundamental breach under Mexican
law and that the Mexican Supreme Court has established that, in such cases, the amparo
court should offer protection to the aggrieved party, even if its arguments were
insufficient or incomplete, through the institution of the so-called suplencia de la
deficiencia de la queja (supplement of the deficiency of the complaint)>!®. According
to Lion’s expert, the suplencia de la deficiencia de la queja gives the Juez de amparo
the power to ex officio complement the amparo claim with any evidence that may be
relevant to the case in furtherance of an aggrieved party’s fundamental rights*!’. Thus,
the Juez de Distrito could have not only admitted the evidence proposed by Lion but
also requested any other relevant evidence, given the gravity of the claim of lack of
service. Respondent does not directly oppose Claimant’s analysis of the suplencia de
la deficiencia de la queja.

Case law

The Tribunal observes the similarity of the facts with those in Jdler, where the
respondent State invoked a seemingly valid legal basis (an ancient remedy inherited
from a codification by Spanish Kings) to circumvent granting the claimant the
execution of a judgment he should have been accorded under the law. Mexico was
using a similar formalistic excuse — procedural requirements that were very minor in
their nature and which did not apply in other circumstances — to bar Lion from
exercising its right to defense before a court.

The Tribunal also takes note of the similarities of the situation affecting Lion with that
of the French individual in the Fabiani arbitration, where a denial of justice was found
because Mr. Fabiani was unable to obtain a decision granting exequatur by Venezuelan
courts to a judgment in his favour against local defendants*'*. Similarly, Lion was

Award

unable to obtain a decision on the false character of the Forged Settlement Agreement
from the local Courts, despite multiple diligent attempts to obtain such a ruling.

Having been refused the opportunity to produce evidence of the forgery, Lion had no
means to prove that the emplazamiento was wrong. Lion was disarmed and unable to
properly exercise its right to defense. Like in Ballistini, where the French-Venezuelan
Commission made a finding of denial of justice

“Tb]ecause the local authorities deprived Ballistini of the legal means of instituting
before the competent tribunals the actions which the laws would authorize him” *””,

Lion was deprived by the local authorities of the legal means in the form of presenting
relevant and material evidence, to defend its case.

D. Conclusion

In conclusion, coming back to Paulsson’s definition that “[d]enial of justice arises when
proceedings are so faulty as to exclude all reasonable expectation of a fair decision
[...]”, the Tribunal finds that Lion, after three years of fighting within the municipal
judicial system, could not expect a fair decision within a reasonable timeframe.

Similarly, using the Mondev test proposed by Respondent, the Tribunal is convinced
that Claimant suffered “a wilful disregard of due process of law, ... which shocks, or
at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety”: first, when Lion was not properly
notified of the Cancellation Proceeding and was judged in absentia, and later when it
was barred from effectively making its case that it had been the victim of fraud and
from presenting relevant and material evidence, necessary to support its argument.

The Mexican Courts had four opportunities to address the question of the forgery of
the Settlement Agreement. They did not do so for reasons which were unclear,
contradictory within the same process, or purely formalistic. The Tribunal finds that
the decisions of the Mexican Courts repeatedly denying Lion the right to present
relevant and material evidence to defend its case, amount to an improper and egregious
procedural conduct, which does not meet the basic internationally accepted standard of
administration of justice and due process, and which shocks or surprises the sense of
judicial propriety.

Having established that Mexico’s Courts denied Lion justice by restricting its access
to justice and its right to defend itself and present evidence to support its case, the
Tribunal does not need to look into whether Lion also suffered undue delay.

V1.2. EXHAUSTION OF LOCAL REMEDIES

Mexico presents a major counterargument to refute Lion’s claim for denial of justice:
that Claimant decided to withdraw the Amparo claim, and that as a consequence of
such withdrawal, it failed to exhaust local remedies — a requirement for a finding of
denial of justice*”°.

Claimant does not deny that it withdrew the Amparo Proceeding, but argues that Lion
pursued all adequate and effective remedies available to it, within the limits of
reasonableness*”'.

The Tribunal will first summarize the Parties’ positions (1.), then the relevant facts (2.),
then the law regarding exhaustion of legal remedies, including its exceptions (3.), and
finally discuss and dismiss Mexico’s counterargument (4.).

POSITION OF THE PARTIES

A. Claimant’s position

Claimant acknowledges that under international law a finding of denial of justice is
premised on the claimant having exhausted local remedies, i.e. judicial measures which
could result in the Mortgages being reinstated**’. Claimant adds that the exhaustion
tule has to be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive
formalism*”,

Claimant explains that it pursued the Amparo proceedings, the only avenue which was
open to it: it was forced to choose between either filing an Amparo claim or a nulidad
de juicio concluido [also “nullity proceeding”) action. According to Lion, it was
impossible for it to bring both an Amparo claim and a nullity proceeding in the same
matter***. It further argues that the criminal proceedings are not adequate to deal with
contractual issues, and pursuing the case further in criminal courts would not have led
to binding findings for civil courts*>.

Claimant adds that it filed and pursued the Amparo Proceedings, until it became
obvious that continuation was futile, whereupon it decided to withdraw such
Proceedings.

519.

520.

521.

522.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

Claimant’s arguments are the following:
a. Undue delay

Claimant says that, as codified by the International Law Commission, local remedies
do not need to be exhausted when there is undue delay in the remedial process,
attributable to the State. And in this case, the Amparo Proceedings were excessively
and unreasonably long and continuation of the Amparo Proceeding would have
extended that unreasonable delay at least by 2.5 years*®.

b. Mexico’s lack of diligence

Claimant avers that the withdrawal of the Amparo Proceedings became necessary due
to Mexico’s own lack of diligence. The Amparo Courts could and should have raised
the existence of the False Amparo much earlier, in early 2013. If the Amparo Courts
would have been diligent, Lion would have had the opportunity to exhaust the Amparo
Proceedings within the three-year time limit provided for by NAFTA Article 1116°2’.

Lion did everything that was reasonable, but, despite its best efforts, Mexican Courts
did not provide effective means to reverse the cancellation of the Mortgages within a
reasonable period. Mexico cannot rely on the ineffectiveness of its own system to
prevent a finding of denial of justice***.

ec. Continuation of the Amparo Proceeding was not necessary

As a second argument, Claimant says it was not required to continue with the Amparo
Proceedings, because such proceedings did not meet the test (established in the Loewen
decision) of being adequate, effective and reasonably available:

First, as regards adequacy, Claimant says that the Amparo Proceedings were the only
adequate proceedings available to undo the cancellation of the Mortgages*”’.

Second, as regards the effectiveness criterion, Claimant adds that the most likely
outcome of the Remand Amparo would have been for the Juez de Distrito to decide
that the Amparo was inadmissible**’. But in the most optimistic scenario, assuming
that the Juez de Distrito had decided that the False Amparo indeed was a fraudulent
machination, Lion would then have to re-submit its initial appeal to the Tribunal de
Queja, requesting the opportunity to prove that the Forged Settlement Agreement had
been falsified. However, the same Tribunal de Queja had already ruled that no hearing

Award

would be allowed; there was no reason to assume that the Tribunal de Queja would
change its position, and there was no appeal to the Supreme Court*?!.

Claimant adds a second argument: even if the Juez de Distrito and then the Tribunal
de Queja had decided in its favour, the result would be a finding that Lion had not been
properly served in the Cancellation Lawsuit — but not the reestablishment of the
Mortgages. The Cancellation Lawsuit would be reopened before the Juez de lo
Mercantil, and a new series of proceedings, taking between 18 and 36 months, would
have to be started, to annul the Cancellation Judgement and reinstall the Mortgages***

Third, concerning reasonableness, Claimant avers that even under the most favourable
scenario, the exhaustion of the Amparo Proceedings would have lasted an additional
2.5 to 3.5 years as of December 2015, resulting in a delay of six years for a simple and
straightforward Amparo>*?.

Claimant adds that pursuing further Amparo Proceedings would have required Lion to
definitively waive its judicial expropriation claim before NAFTA tribunals, due to the
three-year time limits established in Art. 1116 and 1117 NAFTA — an unreasonable
requirement***.

B. Respondent’s position

As a starting point, Mexico asserts that under international law, exhaustion of local
remedies is a requirement for a finding of denial of justice, as acknowledged by
publicists, State practice, NAFTA jurisprudence and non-NAFTA jurisprudence*>.

The unavailability exception

Mexico acknowledges that exhaustion of local remedies knows one exception, which
is however subject to a high test: unavailability. An aggrieved alien does not have to
exhaust local remedies that are not available. Respondent says that the NAFTA
jurisprudence focuses on availability, not on futility. Provided that remedies are
available, Claimant is required to exhaust them**°. Mexico says that the threshold test
of unavailability was set in Loewen and Apotex**’.

Turning to the facts, Mexico says Claimant did not exhaust all proceedings which in
accordance with Mexican law were available:

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

First, Respondent says that Lion failed to exhaust other avenues under Mexican law to
avoiding the cancellation of the Mortgages, like a nulidad de juicio concluido action***
or the criminal proceedings already initiated by Lion*?.

Second, Mexico disagrees with Claimant’s argument that continuing with the Amparo
Proceedings would have been ineffective. In Respondent’s view, Claimant essentially
is arguing that the Tribunal de Queja and the Supreme Court were unlikely to render
any decision in its favour. However, as the Apotex tribunal announced, what matters is
not the likelihood that the higher judicial authority would have granted the relief the
Claimant sought, but simply the availability of further remedies. In this case a multitude
of remedies existed**°. Respondent also denies that the Mexican Courts incurred in
unreasonable delay, or that the expected duration of the remedy procedures would be
unreasonable**!.

Third, as regards Claimant’s argument that it was obliged to withdraw the Amparo
Proceedings, because the three-year limit established in Art. 1116 and 1117 NAFTA
was approaching, Respondent says that the time limitations imposed by these
provisions begins on the date on which there is “knowledge of the alleged breach”.
Since local remedies must be exhausted before it can be determined if justice has been
denied, the limitation period had not started to run at the time the Amparo Proceedings
were abandoned. Thus, the entire rationale for the Claimant abandoning the proceeding
was unfounded*?.

Finally, Mexico submits that the Claimant was not required to withdraw from the
Amparo Proceedings to comply with the waiver requirement established in NAFTA
Art. 1121, because the Amparo Proceedings fall within the exception of NAFTA Art.
1121(1)(b) (“except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary
relief, not involving payment of damages”)>**.

Facts

On December 18, 2012 Lion filed an Amparo indirecto lawsuit*** before the Juez de
Distrito in Jalisco. The Amparo was based on a breach of Art. 14 and 16 of Constitucién
Politica of Mexico, and the actos reclamados included the lack of proper
emplazamiento of Lion in the Cancellation Lawsuit.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

The development of the Amparo Proceedings has been described in section IV.7 above.
Suffice it to say here that more than two years after the initial filing of the Amparo, on
April 17, 2015, the Tribunal de Queja decided sua sponte to remand the case back to
the Juez de Distrito, with the limited purpose to determine whether Lion’s Amparo
proceeding was inadmissible, a different Amparo relating to the same facts having been
filed at an earlier date and thereafter abandoned.

When the Tribunal de Queja raised the issue of the False Amparo it came as a total
surprise:

- For the last 16 months of Amparo proceeding no party and no prior court had
ever referred to this admissibility issue**>;

- The same Tribunal de Queja had also failed to raise the issue when it first
intervened in these proceedings, to adjudicate an appeal against interlocutory
decisions of the Juez de Distrito;

- The Tribunal de Queja decided sua sponte, and over a year into the recurso de
revision, to raise the existence of the False Amparo; the only reason given by the
Tribunal de Queja to justify its decision was that an unidentified administrative
official had informed the Court of the existence of the previous Amparo™®.

As regards the remand procedure, the Tribunal de Queja ordered that it should be
restricted to adjudicating the admissibility issue, explicitly prohibiting the parties from
presenting new evidence regarding the falsehood of the Settlement Agreement**” and
instructing the Juez de Distrito not to analyze Lion’s allegation that such Agreement
had been forged***.

After three years of judicial battling, Lion still had no decision confirming the
falsehood of the Forged Settlement Agreement, and after the remand decision it was
fighting to prove that it should not be deprived of the Amparo recourse — the only way
to overturn the wrongful cancellation of the Mortgages.

The Remand Amparo

The fact that the Remand Amparo was being tried by the same judge who had already
dismissed evidence on the forgery, did not discourage Lion from bringing once more a
petition to admit evidence on the fraudulent nature of the Forged Settlement*’. And,

since Lion had only acquired knowledge of the False Amparo’s existence at this point, it
also provided evidence pointing to the inauthenticity of the False Amparo*™.

539. On September 23, 2015 the Juez de Distrito only accepted the graphology expert report
and a brief filing on the False Amparo as evidence**'. The Juez de Distrito used
formalistic reasoning to reject further evidence provided by Lion**.

Lion’s withdrawal

540. On December 11, 2015 Lion decided to withdraw the Amparo Proceedings in their
entirety.

3. THE LAW

541. Lion’s claim for denial of justice is based on Art. 1105 of NAFTA, which provides that
Mexico shall accord to investments of protected investors treatment in accordance with
international law, including FET. The FTC Interpretation Note equates the standard of
protection to be applied under Art. 1105 of the NAFTA with the standard of “customary
international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens”.

542. This “minimum standard of treatment” incorporates denial of justice, together with its
traditional requirement that the aggrieved investor, to be authorized to proceed against
the State, must first have exhausted all legal remedies available in the municipal Court
system and must have lodged appeals up to the highest instance (A.). The requirement
is, however, subject to an exception: exhaustion is unnecessary in situations where
lodging an appeal would be obviously futile (B.)

A. The requirement

543. The rule of exhaustion of local remedies derives from the customary international law
principle that, prior to bringing an international claim, the foreign national must have
first resorted to the host State’s legal remedies to obtain redress.

forbidden under the applicable law, see RR, para. 119 together with footnote within, invoking inadmissibility

This principle of customary international law was developed in the context of
diplomatic protection in the Interhandel and ELSI cases***. In Interhandel the ICJ
stated that®**:

“The rule that local remedies must be exhausted before international proceedings
may be instituted is a well-established rule of customary international law [...]
Before resort may be had to an international court ... it has been considered
necessary that the State where the violation occurred should have an opportunity
to redress it by its own means, within the framework of its own domestic legal
system”.

The ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection records this well-established principle
in Article 14.

Article 14. Exhaustion of local remedies
1. A State may not present an international claim in respect of an injury to a

national [...] before the injured person has, subject to draft article 15, exhausted
all local remedies”.

The exhaustion rule in investment protection cases

It is unanimously accepted that the exhaustion rule is a substantial element of denial of
justice and applies beyond diplomatic protection. Professor James Crawford,
rapporteur on State Responsibility of the ILC, said that**:

“the exhaustion of local remedies rule is not limited to diplomatic protection”.

The academic writings on investment protection support this view. Paulsson recalls
that:

“[flor a foreigner’s international grievance to proceed as a claim of denial of
justice, the national system must have been tested. Its perceived failings cannot
constitute an international wrong unless it has been given a chance to correct
itself,

“i]t is accepted that denial of justice becomes internationally wrongful only after
the whole system of administration of justice has been put to the test by exhaustion
of local remedies**””.

The Tribunal concurs: a claim for denial of justice only becomes ripe when the
remedies available in the legal system of the host State to impeach the decision have
been exhausted. The underlying reasons for this requirement are twofold:

- It guarantees that the host State’s judicial system is provided with an opportunity
to rectify errors in the decision of lower court instances, and

- It guarantees that international tribunals do not become appeal Courts for
dissatisfied investors.

Case law

Investment tribunals in the context of NAFTA have endorsed the same conclusion®**.
The Tribunal in Loewen specifically stated that a claim for denial of justice within
Article 1105 NAFTA, incorporated the exhaustion requirement>”’:

“The purpose of the requirement that a decision of a lower court be challenged
through the judicial process before the State is responsible for a breach of
international law constituted by judicial decision is to afford the State the
opportunity of redressing through its legal system the inchoate breach of
international law occasioned by the lower court decision. The requirement has
application to breaches of Articles 1102 and 1110 as well as Article 1105”.

The Waste Management II tribunal, for instance, stated in the context of assessing a
denial of justice claim that*°:

“The system must be tried and have failed, and thus in this context the notion of
exhaustion of local remedies is incorporated into the substantive standard and is
not only a procedural prerequisite to an international claim”.

Investment tribunals in non-NAFTA cases have come to the same conclusion. For
example, in OJ European Group B.V. the tribunal emphasized the need to give the host
State’s judicial system an opportunity to rectify its mistakes so as to avoid the use of
international law as a system of appeals against judgments unfavourable to investors:

“International Law cannot become a convenient system to appeal any domestic
court decision the investor disagrees with. Before it can be established under

Non-Disputing Parties

The United States*°? and Canada*® have defended the same position in their Non-
Disputing Party submissions:

- The USA says that the international responsibility of States may only be invoked
with respect to final judicial acts, unless recourse to further domestic remedies is
obviously futile or manifestly ineffective*; judicial acts only result in a breach
of Article 1105(1) if the justice system as a whole, as validated by a court of the
highest instance, produces a denial of justice*®;

- Canada also submits that a denial of justice claim must be preceded by the local
court decisions reaching finality at the court of last resort of the State’s
judiciary*®.

B. The exception of obvious futility

The requirement that local remedies be exhausted is subject to an exception: an alien
cannot be required to take a measure or lodge an appeal which will not remedy the
international wrong.

a. The position of the Parties and the Non-Disputing Parties

The precise scope of the exception to the rule of exhaustion of local remedies has been
much discussed by the Parties:

- Lion says that the claimant must only exhaust remedies which are adequate,
effective and reasonable*’, while

- Mexico submits that the only remedies which do not have to be exhausted are
those which are unavailable, adding that NAFTA jurisprudence (Loewen,
Apotex) focuses on availability, not on futility>®.

ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

The Non-Disputing Parties have also presented their views on the exception to the rule
of exhaustion:

- The USA recognizes that the exhaustion rule does not apply whenever further
recourse for a claimant is obviously futile or manifestly ineffective; further
remedies are obviously futile where there “was no justice to exhaust>”°”; but it is
not enough for a claimant to allege the “absence of a reasonable prospect of
success or the improbability of success, which are both less strict tests*””.

- Canada also acknowledges that the rule gives way whenever it would be
“demonstrably futile” to pursue local remedies*”?; whether recourse to further
appeals of a domestic court judgment is futile is “a fact-specific inquiry taking

into consideration the availability, adequacy and effectiveness of the remedy”*”>.
b. Position of the Tribunal

Mexico argues that under NAFTA the only remedies which do not have to be exhausted
are those which are “unavailable”, adding that NAFTA jurisprudence equates
unavailability with futility. Mexico seeks support in two NAFTA cases Loewen and
Apotex.

Mexico’s position is excessively restrictive. It implies that an investor is obliged to
pursue all available remedies, even if there is no reasonable prospect that the request
or appeal will effectively undo the international wrong.

Scholars in the realm of investment protection, such as Paulsson, suggest that the
appropriate test should be more flexible, and based on the formulation of Judge
Lauterpacht in his separate opinion the Norwegian Loans case: the remedies that ought
to be pursued are those which offer a “reasonable possibility of an effective remedy”>”*.
Paulsson explains that*”>:

“[t]he victim of a denial of justice is not required to pursue improbable remedies.
Nor is he required to contrive indirect or extravagant applications beyond the
ordinary path of a frontal attempt to have the judgment by which he was unjustly
treated set aside, or to be granted a trial he was denied”.

560. Prof. Amerasinghe describes the exception as follows*”*:

“The test of obvious futility clearly requires more than the probability of failure
or the improbability of success, but perhaps less than the absolute certainty of
failure. The test may be said to require evidence from which it could reasonably
be concluded that the remedy would be ineffective”.

561. The ILC has recorded this exception in its Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection:
“Article 15. Exceptions to the local remedies rule

Local remedies do not need to be exhausted where:

(a) There are no reasonably available local remedies to provide effective redress,
or the local remedies provide no reasonable possibility of such redress”.

562. In the Tribunal’s opinion, the exhaustion rule is subject to two categories of exceptions:
an aggrieved alien is only required to pursue remedies

- which are reasonably available (i), and

- which have an expectation that they will be effective, i.e. the measure or appeal
has a reasonable prospect of correcting the judicial wrong committed by the
lower courts (ii).

Reasonable availability

563. (i) The first facet of the exhaustion rule is that the aggrieved alien must launch all
remedies, which are not extravagant, and take them to the highest judicial instance in
the land.

564. The burden on Claimant is not to pursue all possible remedies, but only those which
are reasonably available. In the words of Paulsson*”’:

“[t]he victim of a denial of justice is not to pursue improbable remedies. Nor is he
required to contrive indirect or extravagant applications beyond the ordinary path
of a frontal attempt to have the judgment by which he was unjustly treated set
aside, or to be granted a trial he was denied”.

565. Prof. Amerasinghe supports the same conclusion*’*:

ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

“An aggrieved alien is bound only to exhaust those remedies that are available to
him. The requirement thus postulated has been described in terms of
accessibility”.

566. In its Commentary to the ILC Draft on Diplomatic Protection, the ILC recalls that the
“reasonable availability” test is supported by judicial decisions that considered that
remedies need not be exhausted when”:

“[...] the local court has no jurisdiction over the dispute in question; the national
legislation justifying the acts of which the alien complains will not be reviewed
by local courts; the local courts are notoriously lacking in independence; there is
a consistent and well-established line of precedents adverse to the alien; the local
courts do not have the competence to grant an appropriate an adequate remedy to
the alien; or the respondent State does not have an adequate system of judicial
protection”.

Effectiveness

567. (ii) The aggrieved alien is not under an obligation to resort to an appeal which, although
available, was obviously futile. As Prof. Amerasinghe explains, this exception®*°

“was a compromise between the interests of the respondent state in having a fair
opportunity of doing justice by its own means and those of the alien in having the
most efficient justice done at the lowest cost in the quickest way”.

568. The seminal case establishing this exception was the 1934 Finnish Vessels Arbitration,
which held that a claimant is not obliged to resort to an appeal, provided that such
remedy was “obviously futile”**'. In the specific case the arbitrator found that where
the finding of fact by a lower instance court was final, and the success of the claimant’s
case depended on a different finding of fact, an appeal to a higher Court was obviously
futile**?,

569. This initial threshold has been lowered by several decisions that followed. In the

Ambatielos Case, the Arbitration Commission said that***:

“Tt is the whole system of legal protection, as provided by municipal law, which
must have been put to the test [...]. It is clear, however, that [the exhaustion rule]
cannot be strained too far. Taken literally, it would imply that the fact of having

neglected to make use of some means of procedure — even one which is not
important to the defence of the action — would suffice to allow a defendant State
to claim that local remedies have not been exhausted, and that, therefore, an
international action cannot be brought. This would confer on the rule of the prior
exhaustion of local remedies a scope which is unacceptable”.

570. In the Norwegian Loans case, Judge Lauterpacht issued a separate opinion proposing
a lower threshold with regard to effectiveness, which has gathered support in the
writings of jurists***. He stated that:

“The requirement of exhaustion of local remedies is not a purely technical or rigid
tule. It is a rule which international tribunals have applied with a considerable
degree of elasticity [...]

571. Judge Lauterpacht suggested that the exhaustion rule should be put aside where there
was no “reasonable possibility” for the complainant to obtain “an effective remedy”>*>.

Case law

572. The tribunal in Apotex relied on the more rigid “obvious futility” test**°. Other
tribunals, such as Loewen, resorted to the standards of “effectiveness” and “reasonable
availability” of the remedies. The tribunal in ATA Construction considered that the
complainant has to exhaust those remedies that are “plausibly available”**’; and in Jan
de Nul, the tribunal said that the exception applied when “there is no effective remedy

or no reasonable prospect of success”>**.

573. A less rigid approach to the exceptions has been also applied in the non-NAFTA
investment cases. In Duke Energy:

“[t]he Claimants are right to point out that there is no obligation to pursue
‘improbable’ remedies.**””

574. The Ambiente Ufficio tribunal also qualified the rule as applicable only to reasonably
available remedies*””:

“Tt appears to be generally accepted in international law that obligations requiring an
individual to approach a State’s local courts before a claim may be taken to the
international plane do not apply unconditionally. [. “| ony those remedies must be used
which are available ‘as a matter of

ae KK

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that an investor who has suffered denial of justice is
only required to exhaust remedies:

- which are reasonably available, and

- which have an expectation that they will be effective, i.e. the measure or the
appeal have a reasonable prospect of correcting the judicial wrong suffered by
the alien.

DISCUSSION
Mexico argues that Claimant did not exhaust local remedies:

- Claimant should have pursued other adequate remedies (and specifically the
nulidad del juicio concluido), but failed to do;

- Claimant wrongly withdrew the Amparo Proceedings; Claimant’s argument is
simply an assumption that the Tribunal de Queja and the Supreme Court were
unlikely to render any decision in its favour.

Respondent also denies that the Mexican Courts incurred in unreasonable delay, or that
the expected duration of the remedy procedures would be unreasonable”!

Lion defends the contrary position: it avers that
- Mexico incurred in undue delay**”

- Mexico failed to provide effective means to reverse the cancellation of the
Mortgages*?,

- The Amparo Proceedings were the only adequate proceedings available*™*.

- Continuation of the Amparo Proceedings was obviously futile*”*,

The finalization of the Amparo Proceedings would only have resulted in a finding
that the emplazamiento in the Cancellation Lawsuit had been improperly made —
requiring a new procedure to reinstate the validity of the Mortgages;

Exhaustion of local remedies would in total have lasted six years — an
unreasonable period of time>”®.

Decision

579. The Tribunal decides in favour of Lion for three reasons:

A.

The Amparo was the only remedy, reasonably available to the Claimant, to undo
the cancellation of the Mortgages (A.);

Lion sought redress before the highest Court available within the Amparo
proceeding (B.);

Claimant unsuccessfully pursued the Amparo Proceedings for three years before
the two available instances, and withdrew such Proceedings at a time when
continuation would have been obviously futile and no effective redress would be
obtained (C.).

The Amparo was the appropriate remedy

580. In the present case, the international wrong committed by Mexico consists in a denial
of justice: Mexico’s judicial system has denied Lion access to justice by failing to
correct the Cancellation Lawsuit, by denying Lion the right to appeal the Cancellation
Judgement and finally has denied Lion the right to allege and prove the forgery of the
Forged Settlement Agreement. As a result of the denial of justice, the Mortgages,
Lion’s protected investments, have been cancelled and Claimant has lost the protection
afforded by these securities.

581. For Lion the detrimental effects of the Cancellation Proceeding were twofold:

First, the Judgement ordered the cancellation of the Mortgages — and this was
quickly accomplished, because the Judge ordered specific performance of the
decision and by October 2012 the Registros Publicos had cancelled the
Mortgages, which were extinguished for all legal purposes;

Second, the Juez de lo Mercantil also issued a decision, declaring that the
Cancellation Judgement had become res iudicata, and precluding the possibility
that Lion launch a recurso de apelacién.

this decision had already become res iudicata — the ordinary recurso de apelacion was
not any longer available. In the circumstances, Lion had, in principle, to choose
between two procedures:

- The recurso de Amparo; or
- The recurso de nulidad de juicio concluido.

Amparo proceedings are an established institution under State and Federal law of
Mexico, and represent the ordinary means to obtain protection from the Courts when
constitutional rights have been breached*?’. The recurso de nulidad de juicio concluido
is an institution developed by Mexican jurisprudence, which is not codified under the
law of Jalisco or at the Federal level, which can only be used in extraordinary
circumstances to request the annulment of certain civil judgments which are already
causa juzgada.

The Parties’ experts discussed whether Lion could have had access to a recurso de
nulidad de juicio concluido. Mexico’s legal expert — Dr. Ovalle — acknowledged that
this type of remedy was not available to Lion under Codes of Civil Procedure of Jalisco
and Nayarit®”*.

Recurso de nulidad de juicio concluido

Dr. Ovalle, however, suggests that Lion could have initiated a recurso de nulidad de
juicio concluido, based on a supplementary application of the Code for Civil Procedure
of the Federal District (which regulates the nulidad del juicio concluido) and applies to
supplement proceedings under the Commercial Code, pursuant to its Article 1054°°”.
Dr. Ovalle says that the Mexican Supreme Court has established jurisprudence
endorsing this possibility by allowing a party to initiate a juicio de nulidad in civil
proceedings under specific circumstances”. Dr. Ovalle refers to extracts of the
jurisprudence of the Mexican Supreme Court applying this doctrine, in a case of the
1960s regarding prescripcién adquisitiva de dominio (the doctrine of adverse

possession)!

status),

and a case of 2001, regarding a judgement of estado civil (marital

586. Dr. Zamora — Lion’s legal expert — does not agree: he acknowledges the general
jurisprudence of the Mexican Supreme Court that allows the supplementary application
of the Code for Civil Procedure of the Federal District to civil proceedings before the
civil Courts of the Mexican States only in certain cases. Dr. Zamora cites additional
jurisprudence that has clarified that the supplementary application of the Code for Civil
Procedure of the Federal District to commercial proceedings does not include access to
the remedies or appeals not governed in the Commercial Code°?:

“De conformidad con el articulo 1054 del Cédigo de Comercio, la aplicacion
supletoria de la legislacién local en los juicios mercantiles no debe entenderse de
un modo absoluto, sino con las restricciones que el propio numeral sefiala [...]
tratandose de recursos, mismos que se encuentran reglamentados adecuadamente
en ese cuerpo normativo, no existe la citada supletoriedad, en virtud de que tal
legislacion cuenta con un sistema propio y completo de recursos, razon por la cual
no puede sostenerse que deba aplicarse lo dispuesto por el referido articulo 1054
del Cédigo de Comercio”.

587. In particular, with respect to the suppletory application of the nulidad del juicio
concluido, the jurisprudence says that it is available in civil proceedings of “materia

civil”, however, it clarifies that:

“Ahora bien, esta figura juridica [nulidad de juicio concluido] es improcedente
contra juicios mercantiles tramitados conforme al Cédigo de Comercio, ello en
razon de que no prevé dicha nulidad, ni alguna similar mediante la cual pueda
dejarse insubsistente lo resuelto en un proceso anterior, aunado a que no cabe la
supletoriedad del codigo procesal civil citado, ya que no fue voluntad del
legislador hacer excepciones a la cosa juzgada en materia mercantil”.

588. Based on the above considerations, the Tribunal is not convinced that the recurso de
nulidad de juicio concluido was reasonable available to Lion in order to revert the
Cancellation Judgment, which is undisputedly, materia mercantil and not materia civil.

ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

But even if Claimant could, due to a favourable interpretation, overcome the limitation
that the scope of the nulidad de juicio concluido is restricted to judgments of materia
civil, it would encounter an additional hurdle: as pointed by Dr. Zamora, in a judgment
of 2008, the Mexican Supreme Court declared the unconstitutionality of a provision of
the nulidad de juicio concluido regulated in Code for Civil Procedure of the Federal
District®°, because it violated the principle of legal certainty®°. Since then, a party
seeking a nulidad de juicio concluido is required to provide evidence that the
judgement impugned was rendered on the basis of a document that has been declared
false. Lion would have to first file a criminal complaint seeking a declaration by the
criminal Courts, that the Settlement Agreement was a forged document. Only then,
could Lion try to initiate the nulidad de juicio concluido, with the hope that the Mexican
courts would create new jurisprudence and extend the scope of this extraordinary
remedy to a case of materia mercantil.

In any event, Claimant was also precluded from launching successively an Amparo and
a nulidad de juicio concluido. The filing of an Amparo precludes the subsequent
presentation of a recurso de nulidad de juicio concluido. Although Respondent’s expert
testified at the Hearing that the nulidad de juicio concluido and the Amparo are not
mutually exclusive”, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that they are, based on Art.
73 of the Amparo law°’*:

“CAPITULO VIII De los casos de improcedencia
Articulo 73.- El juicio de amparo es improcedente:

[...] XIV.- Cuando se esté tramitando ante los tribunales ordinarios algun recurso
o defensa legal propuesta por el quejoso que pueda tener por efecto modificar,
revocar o nulificar el acto reclamado”.

Claimant chose the Amparo route. That this decision was the reasonably available
remedy is proven by the Debtors foresight: anticipating that Lion would eventually
launch an Amparo (and not a recurso de nulidad de juicio concluido, which was not
reasonably available), the Debtors prepared the False Amparo Proceedings, a
machination intended to forestall (as it eventually did) Lion’s rightful Amparo.

Based on the above, the Tribunal believes that Claimant resorted to the reasonable
available remedy in the given circumstances.

Criminal proceedings

Claimant also launched criminal proceedings, which are still ongoing. The criminal
proceedings also did not constitute a viable alternative avenue for Lion to pursue its
economic claims, due to the vastly different character of criminal proceedings and the
impossibility of obtaining the reversal of the Cancellation Judgment and the
reinstatement of the Mortgages. Thus, Claimant is not required to first reach judicial
finality in their respect to bring its NAFTA Art. 1105 claim.

B. The Tribunal de Queja was the highest Court available within the Amparo
Proceeding

The rule of exhaustion requires that the aggrieved alien obtain a ruling rendered by
highest court in the host State. Claimant says that the Tribunal de Queja was acting
as the Court of highest instance in the Amparo Proceedings and that there was no
possibility for Claimant to bring its case to the Supreme Court of Mexico — an
allegation which has not been challenged by Mexico®!”.

It is, thus, undisputed that Lion had taken its case to the highest available authority: the
recurso de revision brought the Amparo before the Tribunal de Queja, which was the
highest authority available in the Amparo lawsuit.

C. Claimant was entitled to withdraw from the Amparo Proceeding
On December 11, 2015 Lion waived the Amparo lawsuit.

At that point Claimant had spent almost three years in Amparo lawsuits before Mexican
Courts, trying to undo the fraudulent cancellation of the Mortgages. It had achieved
very little:

- Lion had been deprived, by an idiosyncratic decision of the Juez de lo Mercantil,
of filing an ordinary appeal against the Cancellation Judgement (issued by the
same Juez de lo Mercantil);

- The only avenue open to Lion had been an Amparo, which it filed as soon as it
became aware of the Cancellation Judgement, but at a time when it still did not
know that the Debtors had based their case on the Forged Settlement Agreement;
Lion’s recurring attempts to extend the scope of the Amparo to cover the forgery
of the Settlement Agreement and to present evidence proving such forgery, had
been dismissed by the first instance Juez de Distrito and in second instance by
the Tribunal de Queja, for a purely formalistic reason: the ampliacion de la

demanda had been signed on behalf of Lion by its attorney and not by its legal
representative - a minor procedural defect Lion was never offered the opportunity
to remedy;

- Unable to submit that the Settlement Agreement had been forged, Lion’s Amparo
had been dismissed by the first instance Juez de Distrito; in the Amparo
Judgement the Juez de Distrito assumed the Settlement Agreement to be valid
and binding and concluded that Lion’s emplazamiento had been properly served
on Lic. Lopez Medina, Lion’s process agent as identified in the Forged
Settlement Agreement - an obscure attorney, with whom Lion had never had any
relationship and who failed to inform Lion;

- On appeal against the Amparo Judgement, the second instance Tribunal de
Queja, whom Lion had asked to review a further time the prohibition to argue
the forgery issue, did not take up this question; instead the Tribunal de Queja, in
an unexpected move, made sua sponte the decision to remand the procedure back
to the first instance Judge, with a strictly limited remit: to review whether the
Amparo had been properly admitted, in light of the existence of a previous
Amparo (the False Amparo — a decoy procedure filed fraudulently by the Debtors
to derail the admissibility of the real Amparo);

- Upon the instructions of the Tribunal de Queja, the Juez de Distrito again denied
Lion’s request to expand the scope of the remand, so that the Amparo could
encompass the forgery of the Settlement Agreement.

598. According to Claimant’s expert®!', the best-case scenario for the progression of the

Amparo would have required an additional period of between 18 to 30 months to
finalize; a positive outcome in favour of Lion would have resulted in the Cancellation
Proceeding being held anew, which would take one to two more years°!?.

599. But Claimant’s prospects for a best-case scenario were limited:

- First, the Tribunal de Queja remanded the case to the Juez de Distrito with a
strictly limited mandate: to only look into the admissibility of the Amparo
proceedings (in view of the False Amparo), explicitly prohibiting the Juez de
Distrito from discussing the issue of the forgery of the Settlement Agreement,
which constituted the cornerstone of Lion’s Amparo Lawsuit;

- Secondly, Lion’s case was going to be heard by the same Juez de Distrito who
had already dismissed the Amparo in the first instance, and

ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

- Thirdly, in this Remand Amparo, Lion filed a motion alleging the forgery of Mr.
Arechederra’s signature in the False Amparo and requested the Juez de Distrito
to hear the testimony of Mr. Arechederra. The Juez de Distrito rejected the
testimony and relied only on three expert reports to determine the authenticity of
signature stamped in the False Amparo. Lion and one of the Debtors (Bains)
appointed each an expert and the Juez de Distrito appointed a third expert. Lion’s
expert certified that the signature was not of Mr. Arechederra. However, the
Debtor and the Court appointed experts arrived to the opposite conclusion,
considering that the signature in the False Amparo was indeed of Mr.
Arechederra’s®!.

At this point, the fate of the Remand Amparo was in jeopardy: it is most likely that the
Juez de Distrito would have ruled that the False Amparo was authentic, thereby making
Lion’s real Amparo inadmissible and rendering any further legal actions obviously
futile.

[Pro memoria, Lion had lodged an incident at the outset of the Amparo proceeding
alleging that on July 6, 2012 Sr. Arechederra’s signature had been forged in the
false request for copy before the Juzgado de lo Mercantil. In that instance, two of
the three experts (Lion’s expert and the one appointed by the Juez de Distrito) had
concluded that the signature had been forged®!*. Based on the experts’ evidence,
the Juez de Distrito had accepted the falsehood of the signature stamped on the
July 6, 2012 request for copy before the Juzgado de lo Mercantil °'*. That the first
signature of Mr. Arechederra had been forged, would seem to support the
conclusion that his second signature had also been forged — the purpose of the
machination was to file the False Amparo, which required two signatures.]

Thus, Claimant was further away from annulling the cancellation of the Mortgages than
it was at the outset of the local proceedings. Moreover, it had little prospect of success,
since Lion was prohibited from presenting evidence to prove the forgery and the Juez
de Distrito had already once decided against its position. And even if Lion was
successful, the effect of the amparo would be limited to a declaration that the
emplazamiento in the Cancellation Judgement had been improperly made. A new
procedure before the Juez de lo Mercantil would be required, to annul the Cancellation
Judgement, which already had the status of cosa juzgada —a process that would at least
require three years for the Cancellation Judgment to be overturned.

It is at this point when Lion abandoned all hope to obtain redress from the Mexican
judiciary and waived the Amparo lawsuit.

In sum, Lion was put in a situation where three years into the Amparo Proceeding the
only point of discussion was whether such proceedings were admissible at all. In three

years of litigation, Lion was unable to obtain from the Mexican judiciary a recognition
that it had been subject to such a manifest fraud and identity theft, that would
effectively result in the reversal of the cancellation of the Mortgages. It is difficult to
accept that Lion did not exhaust all reasonable and available remedies with a reasonable
prospect of reversing the denial of justice it had suffered.

Case law
Case law supports the Tribunal’s finding.

In the historic Montano case between the US and Peru, the Umpire rejected the US
Government objection of non-exhaustion of local remedies and upheld Peru’s claim.
He wrote®!®:

“The obligation of a stranger to exhaust the remedies which nations have for
obtaining justice, before soliciting the protection of his government, ought to be
understood in a rational manner, that such obligation does not make delusive the
rights of the foreigner .

The Peruvian claimant, a Sr. Montano, had obtained a US Federal judgement in his
favour, but it remained unenforced due to the negligence of a US Marshal charged with
its execution. The US government considered that claimant should have lodged a
complaint against the Marshal, which led the Umpire to ironically reject the US
position saying that “what Montano gained by the sentence was the right to bring
forward another complaint”.

The situation is similar in the present case: even if Claimant were to succeed in the
Amparo Proceedings, what it would have gained is an acknowledgement that it had
been improperly notified in the Cancellation Proceeding, and that these Proceedings
should be repeated, upon proper notification of the American company.

Lion also finds itself in a similar position to the claimant in Saipem, who pursued local
remedies for two and a half years until it became evident that continuing to litigate in
local courts would have amounted to pursuing “improbable remedies” °'”:

“Tt is undisputed that Saipem had already litigated the issue of the arbitral
misconduct for more than two and a half years in front of different courts in
Bangladesh before being served with the decision revoking the power of the ICC
Tribunal. It can thus be held to have exerted reasonable local remedies, having
spent considerable time and money seeking to obtain redress without success

although the allegation of misconduct was clearly ill-founded. Requiring it to do
more and file appeals would amount to holding it to "improbable" remedies.”

eee
609. In sum, the Tribunal finds that Lion exhausted the reasonable available remedies that
could have reversed the cancellation of the Mortgages. Lion was excused from

continuing the Amparo proceeding in light of its obvious futility in the sense of its lack
of any reasonable prospect of reversing the cancellation of the Mortgages.

VI.3. CONCLUSION

The Tribunal’s assessment of the facts of the present case and its conclusions on Lion’s
denial of justice claim are restricted to the conduct of the Courts of Jalisco with respect
to the Cancellation and Amparo Proceedings. The Tribunal does not purport to pass
judgement on the propriety or efficiency of the entire Mexican judicial system, for
which this Tribunal has the utmost respect.

The Tribunal has held that Lion was wrongfully denied the right to appear before the
Juez de lo Mercantil in the Cancellation Proceeding that resulted in the cancellation of
the Mortgages. This was caused by a deeply flawed emplazamiento and declaracion en
rebeldia that the Mexican judicial system never corrected.

Lion was further deprived from the right to appeal the Cancellation Judgment, based
on an improper procedural decision that patently disregarded municipal law: the Juez
de lo Mercantil deemed that the value of the Cancellation Proceeding was less than
MEX 500,000 (circa USD 25,200). This decision was adopted despite the knowledge

- that the Cancellation Judgment had the effect of removing the security for the
Loans with a total value of USD 32.8 M; and

- that the creditor had been declared in rebeldia.

Finally, when Lion sought to remedy this situation through the Amparo proceeding, the
two instances available (Juez del Distrito and Tribunal de Queja) refused Lion’s
repeated requests to be authorized to present evidence and allegations that it had been
subject to a sophisticated fraud that had resulted in the loss of its investment.

The Tribunal has also concluded that Lion pursued the reasonably available remedies
within the Mexican judicial system that should have effectively restored its rights; and
that after several attempts to obtain redress, these remedies proved ineffective and
obviously futile.

In view of all of the above, the Tribunal concludes that Mexico incurred in denial of
justice and failed to provide Lion fair and equitable treatment under NAFTA Art. 1105.

V1.4. THE ALTERNATIVE CLAIMS

Claimant has formulated, in the alternative, two additional claims:

- For judicial and administrative expropriation of Lion’s investment under NAFTA
Art. 1110; and

- For failure to grant Lion’s investment full protection and security under NAFTA
Art. 1105.

Claimant says that Mexico would be liable to award the same compensation for a
breach of denial of justice or for any of the breaches alleged as alternative claims°!’.

The Tribunal has concluded that Mexico is responsible for a denial of justice in breach
of NAFTA Art. 1105, and consequently Lion is entitled to compensation (to be
established in the next section). Consequently, Lion’s alternative claims are moot.

VII. QUANTUM

NAFTA Art. 1135(1)(a) provides for the award of monetary damages and applicable
interest where a Party is found to have violated a Chapter Eleven provision. In the
previous sections the Tribunal determined that Mexico breached the FET standard
enshrined in NAFTA Art. 1105 through a denial of justice.

The NAFTA does not provide rules for the awarding of compensation in denial of
justice claims, in breach of Art. 1105 — unlike in expropriation claims under Art. 1110.
Consequently, the Tribunal must seek the appropriate standard in customary
international law.

Customary international law

The seminal case dealing with compensation under customary international law is the
PCIJ’s Chorzow Factory®'’, a decision from 1928 which, despite the passage of nearly
a century, remains a precedent which is extensively used by investment tribunals. It
established the principle of full reparation for the injury caused, even if the treaty
serving as the basis of the dispute does not contain a specific provision requiring full
indemnification of the wronged party.

The PCIJ found that:

“[...] reparation must, so far as possible wipe out all the consequences of the
illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have
existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not
possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind
would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not
be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it - such are the principles
which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act
contrary to international law”.

The customary international law principle of full reparation has been embodied in Art.
31(1) of the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility, which states that:

“1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the
injury caused by the internationally wrongful act”.

Customary international law thus mandates that breaches by the host State of the
obligations assumed under NAFTA Art. 1105, should be remedied by granting the
wronged investor full reparation for the injury caused.

629.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

Additional guidance is provided by Art. 34 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,
which states that:

“Full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act shall take
the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in
combination, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter”.

In the present case, Claimant seeks solely reparation in the form of compensation, and
Respondent has not proposed that instead it should grant restitution or satisfaction. The
Tribunal must consequently award a compensation sufficient to “wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed”.

Full reparation by compensation requires that the Claimant, as regards its investment,
be restored to the situation in which it would have been, had a breach not occurred. The
appropriate methodology to establish the impairment suffered by Claimant’s
investment requires a three-step approach®!:

- In a first step, the Tribunal must value Claimant’s investment (in this case the
Mortgages) on a certain valuation date, under the assumption that no international
wrong had occurred — the so called “But For Scenario”;

- Ina second step, the Tribunal must determine the actual value of the investment,
taking into consideration the effects of the breach — the so called “As Is
Scenario”;

- In a final step, the difference between the But For and As Is values of the
investment must be calculated, such difference representing the impairment

suffered by the investment due to the host State’s wrongful action.

Claimant is additionally entitled to any additional damages suffered as a consequence
of the breach, to the extent that such damages have been incurred and can be proven.

Valuation date

Determination of the impairment suffered by Claimant’s investment requires selecting
an appropriate valuation date. The Parties hold different positions:

- Claimant estimates that in the judicial foreclosure action it would have acquired
the Properties without an auction (since the debt exceeded the value of the

Award

collaterals) and that it would have re-sold the Properties by March 31, 2015; Lion
proposes that this date should act as valuation date for all Mortgages®?*;

- Respondent, on the other hand, says that the valuation dates should be separate
for each Mortgage, and proposes September 7 and October 16, 2012 — the dates
immediately before the cancellation of the Guadalajara and the Nayarit
Mortgages in the Registro Publico®?.

The Tribunal finds Claimant’s proposed valuation date to be purely hypothetical and
premised on a large number of uncertainties. The only certain date in Claimant’s But
For Scenario is the start of the Foreclosure Proceeding for the Nayarit Property; the rest
of the counter-factual milestones are purely hypothetical — including the
commencement of foreclosure proceedings regarding the Guadalajara Properties, the
ending of both foreclosure proceedings with a judgment ordering foreclosure and
assignment of the Properties to Lion, and ultimately, the possibility of selling these
Properties at arms’ length to third parties around March 2015. The Tribunal lacks
sufficient evidence to make a proper estimation as to when these events may have
happened.

In this situation, the Tribunal prefers the valuation date proposed by Respondent:
Mexico’s denial of justice occurred over several judicial instances and an extensive
period of time; but the origin of the denial of justice can be pinpointed to the
Cancellation Judgment issued by the Juez de lo Mercantil, and the subsequent
cancellation of the Mortgages by the Public Registries. There is also no doubt that such
cancellation was a harmful act: it caused the extinction of the Mortgages and stripped
Claimant’s Loans of the collateral which guaranteed repayment. It thus is appropriate
that the impairment of the investment be calculated as of the date of cancellation of
each Mortgage.

In conclusion, the valuation dates should be September 7, 2012 for the Guadalajara
Mortgages and October 16, 2012 for the Nayarit Mortgage.

KOK

Claimant specifically requests the following categories of compensation”*:

- The first category is the impairment suffered by the investment, to be calculated
as the value of the Mortgages in the But For Scenario (equal to the market value
of the Properties, minus transaction costs) minus the value in the As Is Scenario
(nil) (VIL1.);

The second category are certain Legal Fees which Claimant says could arise as a

local remedies (VII.3).

VII.1. IMPAIRMENT OF THE INVE

 

ENT

The first category of compensation requested by Claimant is the impairment allegedly
suffered by its investment, the three Mortgages, to be calculated as the value of the
Mortgages in the But For Scenario minus the value in the As Is Scenario.

But For Scenario

Claimant submits that the value of the Mortgages in the But For Scenario should be
equal to the market value of the Properties as of the valuation date, minus transaction
costs. In Lion’s opinion, had it not been for Mexico’s breach, it would have been able
to acquire the Nayarit and Guadalajara Properties in the Foreclosure Proceedings and
promptly re-sell them to a willing third party, using the sales price to set off (part of)
the amounts due under the Loans®.

This proposition has not been opposed by Mexico.

The Tribunal agrees: were it not for the Cancellation Judgment issued by the Juez de
lo Mercantil and the failure of Mexico’s judicial system to correct this Judgment, in
breach of the FET standard, the Mortgage registrations in the Nayarit and Guadalajara
Public Registries would never have been cancelled. Upon default of the secured Loans,
Lion would have instituted Foreclosure Proceedings, which would have resulted in the
judicial enforcement of the Mortgages and in the assignment of the Properties to Lion
— assignment of the mortgaged asset to the creditor (and not foreclosure by public
auction) is the rule provided for by Mexican Law when the secured debt exceeds the
market value of the mortgaged asset®®.

In the present case, the secured debt in fact exceeded the value of the Properties: the
Nayarit Mortgage was granted to secure the three Loans, and the two Guadalajara
Mortgages secured the Second Loan and Third Loan respectively. By October 2012 the
total debt under the three Loans amounted to approximately USD 104 M (USD 49,4 M
under the First Loan, USD 38,9 M under the Second Loan and USD 15,9 under the
Third Loan)’. As will be explained infra, the value of the Properties as of October
2012 was less than the debts secured by each of the Mortgages”*.

Zamora II, para. 201.

7 The last invoice that Lion sent to Sr. Cardenas for the payment of the debt is as of June 30, 2011 and it
records a total debt of USD 76 M (See para. 89 supra; CM, para. 27; Exh. C-42). With default interests running,
the debt increased by October 2012 to USD 104 M.

ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

It is also safe to assume that, upon assignment of the Properties, Lion would have
eventually sold them to a willing third party to recover its loans’.

Foreclosure costs

In the But For Scenario, the assignment and re-sale of the Properties would imply
certain foreclosure costs. Claimant agrees that such costs be deducted from the
compensation and avers that the costs include”:

- Public Registry and Notary fees, plus transfer taxes, which amount to 4.6% of
the Nayarit Property sales price and 0.7% of the sales price of the Guadalajara
Properties;

- plus an amount in MEX®*! and USD 50,000 in legal fees.

Respondent has not questioned these amounts, and instead has focused its disagreement
on the value of the Properties.

Valuation of the Properties

Both Parties have engaged valuation experts to determine the market value of the
Properties: Claimant presented the expert opinion of Mr. Marchitelli, who works for
Cushman & Wakefield, and Respondent relied on the valuation carried out by a team
from CBRE.

The valuation of an asset, whether an enterprise, or as in this case, real estate, is a
complex exercise, which requires the election of a certain methodology, the definition
of certain hypotheses, the calculation of certain variables and, at the end of the day, the
making by the valuer of certain estimations. Depending on these factors, different
valuers may reach materially different results.

In this case, Claimant seeks damages of USD 85.9M, based on its expert’s proposed
valuation of the Properties®*?. Respondent’s expert, on the other hand, arrives at a much
more conservative figure, proposing a valuation of USD 47M%?

Given the wide spectrum of results that different valuations may yield, tribunals need
to retain a certain margin of appreciation in determining the final compensation due.
This does not mean that the tribunal becomes an amiable compositeur, because the
tribunal’s margin of appreciation can only be exercised in a reasoned manner and

within the boundaries of the principles of international law for the calculation of
damages™*.

In determining Lion’s compensation for Mexico’s NAFTA breach the Tribunal will
take as its starting point the valuations of the Properties that each of the Parties’ experts
have presented. The Tribunal will thereafter make an adjustment, to reflect the actual
value of the Properties and the Mortgages, in the specific circumstances of this case.

The Tribunal will first assess the market values of the Nayarit Property (1.) and of the
Guadalajara Properties (2.), as calculated by the experts; it will then make certain
adjustments to reflect the proper calculation of the impairment suffered by the
investments (3.); and finally, will address and dismiss Respondent’s ancillary
arguments that purport to reduce the compensation due (4.).

THE MARKET VALUE OF THE NAYARIT PROPERTY

The Nayarit Property is located on Banderas Bay, in an area known as Distiladeras™>.
It is an unimproved, oceanfront tract that covers an area of approximately

373,558 m? °°:

 

Through the property runs an old double lane road, close to the beach, which links the
cities of Punta Mita and La Cruz [the “Old Road”).

The Collaboration Agreement

On July 30, 2008 the Nayarit State Government and Inmobiliaria Bains (one of
Sr. Cardenas’s companies) signed a collaboration agreement [the “Collaboration
Agreement”]°*’. The agreement acknowledged that Inmobiliaria Bains held the
Nayarit Property and that the Old Road ran across it®*’. The Old Road, however, did
not have its “derecho de via liberado” and this was both problematic and irregular™?.
To resolve that situation, the Nayarit State Government planned on building a new road
linking the same two cities (Punta de Mita and La Cruz) but farther away from the
coast? [the “New Highway”].

Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement:

- The Government undertook to give the possession of the Old Road to
Inmobiliaria Bains®!! as soon as the works of the New Highway were
completed®” (which were supposed to last eight months);

- Inmobiliaria Bains would transfer an area of land for the construction of the New
Highway and contribute to a portion of the building costs, estimated at MEX
23.5 M, by bank check issued at that moment in favour of the Government*°.

There is no dispute that the New Highway is presently in use, and so still is the Old
Road.

As will be seen further below, the implications of having the Old Road transverse the
Nayarit Property is one of the main points of departure between the experts.

The expert took the valuations of those seven properties and first, adjusted them for the
difference in time between the date of the conveyance of title for each sale and the most
recent comparable sale. Mr. Marchitelli increased the price for each comparable by the
increase in the Mexican National Consumer Price Index during the same period™®.
After this adjustment for market conditions, the prices ranged from USD 105.88/m? to
USD 232.26/m? %7.

Secondly, the expert adjusted the prices upward or downward depending on whether
the comparables’ location, size, ocean frontage and marketability were better or worse
than the Nayarit Property’s®**; and then weighted the prices according to his

expertise®”.

As a result, the expert believes USD 160 per m? (as of December 2017), in total, USD
59,769,280 to be a market value for the Nayarit Property. The expert suggests using
the Mexican National Consumer Price Index to convert that market value to terms of
the date of valuation®'. The value as of March 31, 2015 would be USD 53.3 M°.

 

Respondent’s criticism

CBRE does not accept USD 160/m? as a reasonable price for the Nayarit Property.
Especially, taking into consideration that the Nayarit Property was sold in July 2016
for MEX 803.69/m? — this means that, if Mr. Marchitelli was correct, the property
would have increased its value by almost 400%.

Additionally, Respondent makes the following comments on the comparables sales
chosen by Mr. Marchitelli:

- Sales 1, 2, 3 and 4 were adjusted upward artificially because of inflation®™; and,
if anything, inflation adjustments should be made taking the average of past five

years’ Mexican National Consumer Price Index;

Sale 1 was a plot sold in conjunction with a Four Seasons hotel; it is however
unclear how Mr. Marchitelli decided to allocate to the plot USD 30.46 M out of
the total sale price™;

Sale 2 (Playa Pontoque) is an inexistent closing: the alleged buyer has informed
CBRE that it never acquired the property®’;

Sale 4 (Rosewood) is part of a larger development, including infrastructure,
which added value to the plot, but no downward adjustment was made in
comparison to the Nayarit Property, which is not part of a master plan
development®*;

Sale 6 consists of two parcels with different uses each®® (a 20,000 m? parcel with
tourist zoning and USD 120/m?, and a second parcel of 54,500 m? with
residential zoning classification”) — a downward adjustment is necessary to
account for the fact that it is a listing price, not a sales price™';

Sale 7 should also be adjusted downward because it is a listing and has a better
location than the Nayarit Property*”.

RESPONDENT’S VALUATION

Respondent’s expert does not agree with Claimant’s special assumption that the Old
Road would become an integral part of the Nayarit Property; the property should be
valued as it is°”?. Hence, Respondent’s expert divides the 373,558 m° of the Nayarit

Property into three distinct areas

674,
Ocean frontage: 139,465 m? (A.);
View on the sea: 204,496 m?(B.);

Old Road and utility poles®”>: 29,596.9 m°.

The expert values the first two areas separately. The third area is disregarded, as it
would not be subject to development.

Claimant’s criticism

675. Mr. Marchitelli does not agree with CBRE’s report, which arrives at a value of the
Nayarit Property equivalent to USD 48.22/ m? °°. Claimant takes issue with a number
of premises assumed by CBRE:

- By dividing the Nayarit Property into two discrete geographical areas,
disregarding the Collaboration Agreement, its full development potential and true
highest and best use was not acknowledged”;

- Comparable 2 was sold on July 29, 2016 for USD 45.12/m”, as a distressed sale,
the seller being an entity controlled by Sr. Cardenas®* and Comparable 4 was
also a distressed sale’; but the very definition of market value used also by
CBRE, provides that transactions are made without duress and the seller is under
no compulsion to sell’;

- Offering 2 is a property more than 30 km away from the beach — it is not
acceptable as a comparable property for an ocean view property”®!;

- Adjustment factors based on whether there is access through fewer or more roads

only make sense when valuing urban property’;

- The land residual method is inherently unreliable because of the many
assumptions that need to be used”, which are totally unsupported”;

the valuation (A.); and which adjusted comparables should be used to determine the
value of the Nayarit Property (B.).

A. Impact of Old Road
It is undisputed that, at valuation date, an Old Road crossed the Nayarit Property.

Respondent’s expert suggests valuing the Nayarit Property as it is, with the Old Road
dividing the Property in two plots: one ocean frontage and one with view on the sea.
Claimant’s expert, on the other hand, puts emphasis on the existence of a Collaboration
Agreement by which the Government of Nayarit granted Inmobiliaria Bains full
possession over the Old Road in exchange of land and money to build the New
Highway; since the New Highway is already built, the expert believes that the Nayarit
Property should be valued under the special assumption that the Old Road would be an
integral part of the Property, and that it could be developed as a whole.

The Tribunal agrees with Claimant on this point.

The terms of the Collaboration Agreement are clear: upon completion of the New
Highway, Inmobiliaria Bains would have complete possession over the Old Road to
use it as it saw fit. Since there is no discussion that the Nayarit Property has more value
without the Old Road”, it seems reasonable to assume that a prospective buyer would
remove the Old Road and develop that strip of land together with the rest of the Nayarit
Property.

In view of the above, the Nayarit Property will be considered, for valuation purposes,
a single piece of land, apt for development as a whole, pursuant to its highest and best
use.

B. Adjusted comparables

Both experts have valued the Nayarit Property through sales comparisons.
Respondent’s expert has also applied a residual use method, as a secondary approach
for validation, a decision criticized by Claimant’s expert””*: the method allegedly is
fraught with unsupported hypotheses’” and a minor change in any of these could have
profound upward or downward effects on the value”*.

The Tribunal notes that both experts have expressed their preference for sales
comparison as the most appropriate method to estimate the value of the Nayarit
Property; thus, to the extent that the Tribunal is satisfied that this approach renders an

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

appropriate value, there will be no need to perform a validation through the residual
method.

Under the sales comparison approach the experts have each provided a list of
comparables which, duly adjusted, could serve to estimate the Nayarit Property’s value.
But both experts have raised a number of critiques regarding the comparables and the
adjustments proposed by the counter-expert. The Tribunal will analyse the suggested
comparables and adjustments, one by one, starting with Mr. Marchitelli’s (a.),
followed by CBRE’s (b.).

a. Claimant’s adjusted comparables

Claimant’s expert found seven comparables (five sales and two listings). Respondent’s
expert has taken issue with three of them:

- Sale 1 (La Solana): according to public information this plot together with a Four
Seasons Resort was sold for roughly USD 200 M™®, of which Mr. Marchitelli
has allocated USD 30.46 M to the land; CBRE questions how Mr. Marchitelli
decided which portion of the price related to the parcel and Mr. Marchitelli
responded that the developer, contacted by a local valuer, confirmed the prices’!°;
the Tribunal sees no reason to strike Sale 1 as comparable: Respondent’s expert
has not denied the sale, nor has it challenged the reasonableness of the price
allotted to the land, or suggested an alternative price — it simply questions Mr.
Marchitelli’s method, but the Tribunal notes that real estate transactions occur in
a closed market, with scarce public data, and in these circumstances it seems
reasonable to rely on local appraisers and on informal contacts with persons
directly involved in the transactions to obtain information which would otherwise
never reach the public.

- Sale 2 (Playa Pontoque): both experts agree that this sale was never
consummated7!'; however, Mr. Marchitelli believes that Sale 2 at least shows a
meeting of the minds’'?; the Tribunal considers that if Sale 2 never became a
closed deal, the proper way to proceed is to treat this sale as a listing and have its
price adjusted accordingly.

- Sale 6: Respondent’s expert avers that this plot actually consists of two parcels
with different uses — one with 20,000 m? and USD 120/m” has tourist zoning, and
the other of 54,500 m? has residential zoning classification’'*; the Tribunal sees
no cause to disregard Sale 6: in its residual approach, CBRE has acknowledged

Award

that the best development of the Nayarit Property would be as two distinct
facilities (a hotel and a residential area) — it seems that Sale 6, prima facie, could
similarly be developed separately as a hotel and as a residential area; and, since
Respondent’s expert has not disclosed the price of the residential zoning parcel
of Sale 6, the Tribunal cannot verify whether the average price provided by
Mr. Marchitelli for both parcels (USD 140/m7) requires a downward adjustment.

In summary, the Tribunal decides that Sales 1, 2 and 6 are proper comparables;
however, Sale 2 needs to be treated as a listing and thus adjusted accordingly. The
following paragraphs will address issues regarding appropriate adjustment and
weighting that need to be applied to all comparable sales.

Respondent’s expert

Respondent’s expert, in essence, took issue with two general adjustments undertaken
by Mr. Marchitelli (i. and ii.) and suggested further downward adjustment on two
comparables (iii.):

(i) Market conditions

Mr. Marchitelli valued the Nayarit Property as of December 2017, the date the
transaction of Sale 5 (Playa Amor) took place. This is the latest date of all transactions
used as comparables. The expert decided to bring the price of the other four previous
transactions to December 2017 using the Mexican National Consumer Price Index.

Respondent’s expert finds that this procedure raises comparable prices artificially’”'*.

And, if at all, inflation adjustments should be made using the average of the past five
years’ Mexican National Consumer Price Index’!>.

The Tribunal does not agree.

Claimant’s valuation relies on comparable sales which took place between December
2013 (Sale 1 — La Solana) and December 2017 (Sale 5 — Playa Amor). But a nominal
price of 2013, in times of inflation, is worth less in 2017 — therefore, it becomes
necessary to harmonise amounts set at different moments in time before performing a
comparison.

To bring forward past amounts and normalise them in terms of inflation, the expert
applies the Mexican National Consumer Price Index, an index which — in general terms
— measures the evolution of the cost of living.

78 CBRE Il, p. 16.

165

693.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

In contrast, CBRE has used unaltered nominal prices of transactions reaching back to
August 2012 and December 20117! to infer a value of the Nayarit Property as of 8
October 2018 — the expert has, thus, assumed that the value of MEX has not changed
between 2011/2012 and 2018; but the evolution of the Mexican National Consumer
Price Index seems to suggest the opposite, as the following graph shows”!’:

 

 

FIRED 2g — corer rice inde at tems or Mexico

 

 

 

 

694.

695.

696.

As to whether Mr. Marchitelli should have adjusted for inflation using the average
National Consumer Price Index of the past five years”'*, the Tribunal finds no support
for such proposition. Claimant’s expert adjusted the past nominal prices to account for
the increases in the National Consumer Price Index between transaction dates and
December 2017; and did the same when discounting the December 2017 value to the
valuation date’!?. Mr. Marchitelli’s use of the National Consumer Price Index to bring
amounts forward and backwards in time has been consistent.

Moreover, it seems that CBRE obviated the criticism just made, when it brought back
the value of the Nayarit Property from October 2018 to October 2012 using the
difference in the National Consumer Price Index between both dates (and not the
average of the past five years)’?°.

(ii) Subjective adjustments

CBRE characterises the adjustments on the sales prices performed by Mr. Marchitelli
as subjective and lacking explanations”!.

699.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

The Tribunal partially agrees with CBRE as all valuation procedures entail a degree of
subjectivity. The appraiser decides, based on his or her expertise, what adjustment
factors are relevant and how to weight the different comparables. But subjectivity does
not equal randomness. The Tribunal is satisfied with the explanations provided by Mr.
Marchitelli of the motivation underpinning the adjustment and weighting factors
used ’”? — this being said without prejudice to the Tribunal’s decision regarding further
adjustments.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that CBRE’s valuation, and more particularly, the choice of
normalisation’? and weighting’* factors is also premised on the subjectivity of the
appraisers who drafted the report.

(iii) Further downward adjustment

Respondent has suggested performing an additional downward adjustment to two
comparable sales:

- Sale 4 (Rosewood) is located in a large luxury development called La Mandarina,
the master plan development of which foresees the construction of certain
infrastructure which Mr. Marchitelli accepted would add value to the plot, yet no
downward adjustment was made to account for the fact that the Nayarit Property
has no master development plan”; the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that a
downward adjustment is warranted — the Tribunal notes, however, that Sale 4 has
been adjusted upward by Mr. Marchitelli because the Nayarit Property has,
generally, a better location”°; absent evidence on the specific weight to be
attributed to adjustment factors for infrastructure and for general location, the
Tribunal decides to weigh them equally, with the result that the new downward
adjustment and the existing upward adjustment for general location cancel each
other out.

- Sale 7 should be adjusted downward because it is a listing and has a better
location than the Nayarit Property’”’; the Tribunal notes that Sale 7 has already
been adjusted downwards to reflect that it is a listing’** — no further adjustments
seem necessary.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico

Award

700. In conclusion, the Tribunal decides to disregard the general location upward adjustment
performed on Sale 4 by Mr. Marchitelli, to compensate for the warranted infrastructure
downward adjustment which was lacking.

eR

701. Mr. Marchitelli relied upon five sales and two listings which in view of the above

decisions must be adjusted as follows

729.

Sale 3 (USD 105.88/m7) needs to be adjusted upwards for an inferior location
and larger size than the Nayarit Property; in order to quantify these two upward
adjustments, the Tribunal will rely on CBRE’s expert opinion, according to
which, the degree of desirability should translate into a 10% increase”*° — since
for Sale 3 two upward adjustments are warranted, the Tribunal will increase the
price by a 1.2 factor; this results in USD 127.06/m°.

Sale 4 (USD 116.08/m?) needs only be adjusted upwards for having less beach
area than the Nayarit Property — the other two proposed adjustments cancelled
each other out, pursuant to the Tribunal’s previous decision”*!; the Tribunal will
apply a 1.1 factor; this results in USD 127.69/m’.

Listing 6 (USD 140.87/m’) requires two downward adjustments for being larger
than the Nayarit Property and a listing rather than a sale, and two upward
adjustments for having less beach and an inferior configuration than the Nayarit
Property — positive and negative adjustments that cancel each other out.

Listing 7 (USD 168.31/m7) requires two downward adjustments for having a
worse location than the Nayarit Property and being a listing, and an upward
adjustment for having less beach — since a positive and a negative adjustment
cancel each other out, the Tribunal must only adjust the listing price by applying
a 0.9 factor (the factor used by CBRE to adjust listing prices’*”); the resulting
price is USD 151.48/m?;

Sale 5 (USD 187.36/m7) is adjusted downward for being larger than the Nayarit
Property and upward twice for having less beach area and a more complicated
shape — this means that the price needs to be increased by a factor of 1.1, USD
206. 1/m?.

704.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

- Sale 1 (USD 220.75/m?) is adjusted downward twice for being larger and in a
better location and upward once for having less beach — in sum, the price will be
adjusted by a factor of 0.9 to USD 198.67/m’;

- Sale 2 (USD 232.26/m7) is only adjusted upward once, to account for the fact
that it has less beach area than the Nayarit Property; thus, the price will be
augmented by a 1.1 factor, USD 255.5/m?.

b. Respondent’s adjusted comparables

Respondent’s expert divided the Nayarit Property in two, on account of the Old Road:
one parcel with ocean frontage and one with view over the sea; then the expert looked
for comparables for each plot.

The Tribunal, however, has accepted as a special assumption that the Old Road is an
integral part of the Nayarit Property and that it is subject to development together with
the rest of the land. Thus, the Nayarit Property is a 373,558 m? ocean frontage plot. It
follows that the comparables identified as sea view without ocean frontage are less
suitable for estimating the value of an ocean frontage property such as the Nayarit one.

But CBRE also located four sales and two listings of parcels with ocean frontage. These
transactions are prima facie eligible comparables. However, Claimant has made a
number of criticisms, which will be addressed by the Tribunal:

- Comparables 2 and 4 should be disregarded because they were distressed sales”,
sold at half the price commanded by properties without any sea frontage”**;
Respondent accepts that Comparable 2 was a distressed sale and should be
eliminated from the analysis’* and, as Claimant points out, Mexico has not
denied that Comparable 4 was a forced sale”**; the Tribunal agrees: both experts
were tasked with estimating the market value of the Nayarit Property’’ and a
distressed sale is outside the scope of market value.

- No inflation adjustment was applied to pre-2018 comparables’**: the Tribunal
notes that CBRE uses the Mexican National Consumer Price Index to bring an
October 2018 value back to an October 2012 value; however, when calculating
the 2018 value, the expert takes transactions which occurred over a period
covering from 2012 to 2017 at nominal value, without performing an inflation
adjustment — this approach artificially brings down the price as when moving

pre-2018 comparables must be subject to an inflation adjustment.

or for proximity to the
Nayarit Property™°: the Tribunal has already accepted that valuation is not an
exact science, but rather open to and dependent on the expertise and subjectivity
of the appraiser — the Tribunal accepts that CBRE, for good reason, favoured

other adjustment factors over those two.

- CBRE adjusted the prices taking into account the number of roads through which
the property is accessible, when in fact this would only be relevant for urban
properties and Respondent’s expert agreed that this adjustment is not relevant to
a beach property™'; the Tribunal will thus disregard this adjustment factor.

705. In summary, the Tribunal shall only consider comparables with ocean frontage and
within this group will disregard Comparables 2 and 4 which are distressed sales (i.),
apply an inflation adjustment (ii.), and not adjust any of the comparables in view of the
number of roads through which the property has access (iii.).

- In September 2016 the index was at 103.08389 whilst in December 2017 it was
at 112.11382 — this means an upward change of the Comparable 1 September
2016 price by 1.084: MEX 1,873.36/m? of September 2016 equal MEX
2,037.46/m? in December 2017;

- In August 2012 the index was at 90.2298, whilst in December 2017 it was at
112.11382 — this requires an upward adjustment of the Comparable 3 August
2012 price by 1.2475: MEX 1,450.3/m? of August 2012 become MEX
1,802.05/m? in December 2017.

Since the comparables provided by CBRE are in MEX, while Mr. Marchitelli’s are in
USD, the Tribunal will convert all amounts into USD. Mr. Marchitelli concluded that
the Nayarit Property was worth USD 160/m? ™#° or MEX 3,100/m? 4’ as of December
2017; this implies an exchange rate of 19.375 MEX/USD. Converted into USD at this
exchange rate, CBRE’s comparables look as follows:

- Comparable 1: MEX 2,037.46/m? in December 2017 is USD 105.16/m?;
- Comparable 3: MEX 1,802.05/m? in December 2017 equals USD 93/m?;
- Offerings 4 and 5: MEX 1,512/m? is 78.04 USD/m?.

(iii) Compared to the Nayarit Property, the only adjustments performed by CBRE for
normalisation purposes were”**:

- On Comparable 3, for surface area (factor 0.92) and equipment (factor 1.05); this
means, in average, a factor of 0.985 that applies to USD 93/m? and results in USD
91.61/m?.

- On Offerings 4 and 5 to account for the fact that their prices do not reflect a close
sale (factor 0.9); this implies that USD 78.04/m’ sales price be reduced to USD
70.2/m?.

The Tribunal has normalised all comparable transactions provided by both experts and

Instead of calculating the arithmetic mean, Respondent’s expert has proposed to use
the average of the quadratic mean and the harmonic mean”*°.

Quadratic mean is often used when the sample has both positive and negative figures,
which the arithmetic mean would cancel out — here, however, there are no negative
figures. The harmonic mean is ordinarily used to calculate the average of ratios and,
for positive data, the harmonic mean will always be the least of means — the Tribunal
is seeking the average of integers, it thus sees no good reason to choose a mean which
tends to minimise the average.

Since the different data have already been adjusted for purposes and weighted for
normalisation, the arithmetic mean seems the most appropriate average: it places equal
value on each element without additional distortions. The arithmetic mean of the prices
of the different comparables is USD 140.42/m?.

The above amount is set at December 2017; the valuation date of the Nayarit Property
is, however, October 16, 20127°!. The Mexican National Consumer Index was
112.11382 in December 2017 and 91.08599 in October 2012; USD 140.42/m? brought
back to October 2012 is USD 114.08/m?. Multiplied by 373,558 m7? it equals
USD 42,615, 497.

At valuation date the Nayarit Property is estimated at USD 42,615, 497.

As anticipated’**, the Tribunal must now deduct the costs related to the foreclosure
sale: 4.6% on the sales price plus USD 25,000; i.e. USD 1,985,3137°.

The net market value of the Nayarit Property, at valuation date, is thus,
USD 40,630,184.

THE MARKET VALUE OF THE GUADALAJARA PROPERTIES

The Guadalajara property consists of two adjacent plots of land which cover a total
area of 15,478 m? ”*. The two plots are also known as Las Américas A and Las
Américas B, with an area of 9,335 m? and 6,143 m’, respectively”.

Las Américas A and B, although adjacent, pertain to different zoning districts, which
impacts on the possible use of the land. Las Américas A is zoned for mixed use and

Las Américas B for residential use”*®.

Claimant’s expert estimated the fair market value of the Guadalajara Properties using
a sales comparison approach (1.), as did Respondent’s expert, but the latter also
performed a residual value approach (2.). Although the experts performed their
valuations under different premises, the results do not lie too far apart: there is a
difference of opinion among the experts of USD 1.5M7**. The Tribunal will determine
which valuation is preferable (3.).

CLAIMANT’S VALUATION

Mr. Marchitelli acknowledges that Las Américas A and Las Américas B each has a
different assigned use. However, he strongly believes that, when two adjacent plots are
held by the same owner and have different uses, the owner may choose the use that
renders the most value out of the two and develop the entire property for that use”. In
this case, Mr. Marchitelli determines that the highest and best use is for a mixed-use
development”.

The expert found six sales for analysis and one additional sale. Here is a summary of
the comparables’®! and their locations’:

758 Claimant proposes USD 29.6 M September 2012, opposed to Respondent’s suggested MEX 365,725,000 in
September 2012. According to Respondent’s Rejoinder, para. $42, Mexico values the Guadalajara Properties
at USD 27.87 M.

- Sale G is a sale that happened more than nine years ago and should, thus, be

they would be developed separately — each according to their highest and best use: Las

deducting costs and expenses and discounting the free cash flows at 16% annually, this
results in a value of MEX 131,960,7007.

Claimant’s criticism
Mr. Marchitelli does not agree with the CBRE, for the following reasons:

- The report concludes that the property would be developed as two distinct
parcels, but this does not maximise its value as required in the definition of
highest and best use”!; the highest and best is a mixed use and this was
acknowledged in an appraisal prepared on October 9, 20147;

- The valuation of Las Américas B does not rely on a single comparable sale, it
793.

only uses listings ””;
- The residual use method is not completely reliable: small changes in the variables
can have dramatic impacts on the value”*.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

The experts focus their disagreement on one main issue: whether the fact that Las
Américas A and Las Américas B have different zoning uses warrants that they be
valued separately.

It is undisputed that Las Américas A and Las Américas B are distinct plots, registered
separately. But it is equally undebated that they are adjacent and belong to the same
owner.

In essence, Mr. Marchitelli has valued the Guadalajara Properties as a single parcel
according to a special assumption: that it is permitted to develop them jointly as a
mixed-use property. The Tribunal, however, cannot accept the special assumption,
which goes against the principle of valuing the property as it is, without proper
evidence that would justify the assumption.

In the previous valuation of the Nayarit Property, Mr. Marchitelli brought evidence that
the Old Road should be deemed an integral part of the Nayarit Property and the
Tribunal, thus, validated that special assumption; but here, Mr. Marchitelli has failed
to refer to any planning legislation which permits adjacent lands, which belong to the

same owner, to be developed as one. Absent supporting evidence, the Tribunal cannot
accept the proposed special assumption. Las Américas A and Las Américas B will,
thus, be valued separately, each according to its own use.

The Tribunal will now estimate the value of Las Américas A (A.) and Las Américas B
(B.) through a sales comparison approach, based on the comparables found by both
experts. For reasons already anticipated”, the Tribunal, if satisfied with the resulting
value, will not perform a secondary valuation through a residual use method.

A. Las Américas A

Las Américas A is a mixed-use plot. The Tribunal will first analyse Claimant’s
comparables (a.) and then Respondent’s (b.).

a. Claimant’s comparables

The Tribunal notes that almost all comparables identified by Mr. Marchitelli are mixed-
use lands (Sales A — F); prima facie the Tribunal accepts this data as eligible
comparables, subject to the appropriate adjustment infra.

CBRE has only taken issue with Sale B because it, allegedly, contains erroneous
information (the surface was 7,580 m? and the sales price USD 12,282,076) — an
allegation which has not been disputed. The corrected price per m? is, thus, USD 1,620
(not USD 1,900 as proposed by Mr. Marchitelli”®), This price needs to be adjusted for
inflation and brought forward to July 2015, by a factor of 1.06897”; this results in an
actual (corrected) price of USD 1,732/m?.

Mr. Marchitelli’s sole additional adjustment is for size: smaller sites tend to sell for
more unit price. Since the Guadalajara Properties will be valued separately, the
Tribunal must determine whether the adjustments for size made by Mr. Marchitelli still
apply, now that the subject property (Las Américas A) is reduced from 15,478 m? to
only 9,335 m?. The Tribunal notes that Sale B is the only comparable similar in size to
Las Américas A (7,580 m? 78, as opposed to 9,335 m’); Sales C, D and E have each an
area of around 4,000 m? and thus need a downward adjustment; whilst Sales A and F
(14,000 m? and 18,200 m’, respectively) require an upward adjustment. Absent specific
evidence on the weight attributed by Mr. Marchitelli to the size adjustment, for
consistency reasons’? the Tribunal decides to apply a 0.1 factor upward or downward.
The sales adjusted sales prices per m? are as follows:

Respondent’s comparables

745. CBRE has identified five sales comparables for mixed use and three listings*’. The
Tribunal will adjust the sales price to account for inflation (i.) and then it will convert
all amounts into USD (ii.).

746. (i) As already seen in the valuation of the Nayarit Property, an adjustment of the
comparable prices for inflation becomes necessary. All values will be adjusted in time
to July 2015 — the date used by Mr. Marchitelli in his valuation — using the Mexican

National Consumer Price Index’

801.

Comparable | dates from July 2016; in July 2016 the consumer price index was
102.17028, whilst in July 2015 it was 99.53, thus a factor of 0.974°” needs to be
applied — the sale price of MEX 15,341/m? is brought down to MEX 14,944/m°.

Comparable 2 is from 2015; no month has been specified — absent this
information, the Tribunal assumes that the sale took place in the mid-year and
the sale price of MEX 46,442.7/m? need not be adjusted.

Comparable 3 is from 2014; lacking evidence on the month in which the
transaction happened, the Tribunal will assume it happened in the mid-year — in
July 2014 the consumer price index was 96.87454, whilst in July 2015 it was
99.53, thus a factor of 1.027% needs to be applied — the sale price of
MEX 34,786.64/m? is raised to MEX 35,739/m?.

Comparable 4 is from July 2013; in July 2013 the consumer price index was
93.08379, whilst in July 2015 it was 99.53, thus a factor of 1.069° needs to be
applied — the sale price of MEX 38,454.55/m? is increased to MEX 41,117/m?.

This amount is set at July 2015, whereas the valuation date of the Guadalajara
Properties is September 7, 2012%°’. The Mexican National Consumer Index was

of USD 19,051,406,

B. Las Américas B

For las Américas B, with residential use, CBRE found six listings: three for residential
use and another three for mixed use. Apparently, CBRE incorporated the mixed use
listings because the plots were planned to be developed as residential home
(construccion habitacional)*!, In view of a criticism made by CBRE, the Tribunal has
accepted that each of the Guadalajara Properties be valued separately, on account of
the different ground uses, and the Tribunal has disregarded the mixed used properties
identified by Mr. Marchitelli as comparables for Las Américas B; consequently, the
three mixed use listings relied upon by CBRE to value Las Américas B should equally
be disregarded.

The Tribunal will estimate Las Américas B’s values based on the other three listings
with residential use found by CBRE and one additional sale for residential use
identified by Mr. Marchitelli (Sale G). Mr. Marchitelli has questioned the relevance of
the comparables, since they do not represent closed sales — the Tribunal accepts the

critique and notes that CBRE has applied a 0.95 reducing factor to account for this
fact*!'. In turn, CBRE suggests that Sale G be stricken because the sale took place in
2009 and thus would lack relevance — the Tribunal notes that Sale G is the only closed
transaction and for this reason the Tribunal has decided not to disregard it.

Adjusted to July 2015, Sale G has a price of USD 2,168/m? *"; since the rest of the
comparables are listings, they need not be adjusted for inflation®'*, and just have to be
converted into USD at the 15.24 MEX/USD exchange rate*!*:

- Listing 5: MEX 29,215/m? is USD 1,917/m’;
- Listing 6: MEX 18,104/m? is USD 1,188/m’.
The arithmetic mean of the above data is USD 1,677/m?.

This amount is set at July 2015. Adjusted to the valuation date, the sale price is reduced
to USD 1,527.4/m’. Multiplied by 6,143 m7, it equals a total value of USD 9,382,669.

eR

At the valuation date, September 7, 2012, Las Américas A is worth USD 19,051,406
and Las Américas B is valued at USD 9,382,669; in total, the estimated value of the
Guadalajara Properties is USD 28,434,075.

The Tribunal needs now to deduct the foreclosure sales costs which are*'’: 0.7% of the
sales price, MEX 100,700.69 plus 3% on the balance price minus MEX 3,736,575, and
UD 25,000 in legal fees.

The sales price has to be converted into MEX. Up to this point, as the the exchange
rates were undisputed, the Tribunal has relied on the exchange rates used by Mr.
Marchitelli; however, September 2012 was not a relevant date in Mr. Marchitelli’s
expert reports and he does not provide this information. In the absence of this input
from the expert, the Tribunal has applied the exchange rate of September 7, 2012

1,345,9128!°. Now USD 25,000 needs to be added for legal fees, i.e. USD 1,370,912.

The sales price minus associated costs is, thus, USD 27,063,184.
CALCULATION OF THE IMPAIRMENT

The Tribunal has determined the market value of the Nayarit Property on October 16,
2012, to be USD 40,630,184; and that of the Guadalajara Properties on September 7,
2012 to be USD 27,063,184.

Lion avers that the impairment of its investment, as a consequence of the breach,
equates with the market value of the Properties: upon the Debtor’s default and the filing
of the Foreclosure Proceedings, Lion would have acquired ownership of the Properties
in lieu of payment, and would promptly have re-sold the Properties to third parties
through arms’ length transactions, thereby securing the full market value of the
Properties (i.e. approximately USD 67 M for all Properties, as established by the
Tribunal with the experts’ methodologies)*””.

The Tribunal finds Lion’s assumption far too optimistic.

Lion in essence assumes that in the But For Scenario, it would have succeeded in re-
selling the Properties at full market value. This assumption disregards the substantial
uncertainties and legal risks which Lion would have faced in its efforts to foreclose on
the Mortgages and to re-sell the Properties, uncertainties and risks which are unrelated
to Mexico’s breaches of its NAFTA obligations.

These risks arise from the very terms of the Loans (speculatively high interest rates of
18% and 25% when the Loans were in default, and short maturities), and the personal
characteristics of the Debtors selected by Claimant. These risks have been exacerbated
by Sr. Cardenas’ obstinate (and as the facts show highly effective) defense of his legal
rights, above and beyond the proper conduct required by Mexican law. The Tribunal
considers that a hostile reaction by Sr. Cardenas to the resale of valuable properties that
he had owned and for many years had sought to develop is not a mere possibility but

close to a certainty. His willingness to engage in administrative and legal frauds and
abuses to obtain his ends has been amply demonstrated in these proceedings as,
unfortunately, has his effectiveness with these abuses within his home state of Jalisco.

Any possible re-sale of the Properties to a willing buyer would have faced the risks of
obstructions and possible legal challenges by Sr. Cardenas and the Debtors, in
proceedings before the Courts of his home State, Jalisco. Most buyers would have shied
away from assuming these risks; the few prepared to accept the uncertainty would only
do so if offered a significant discount over market prices.

The necessity to offer discounts to prospective buyers has an important consequence:
awarding Claimant the full market price of the Properties, would not result in re-
establishing the situation which would have existed, absent Mexico’s breach, but in a
windfall profit. The proper compensation must be reduced by the probable discount a
willing buyer would have applied.

How to calculate the correct percentage of discount?

No formula exists, and there is no set of precedents, from which a precise number could
be induced. In situations like this, where the precise determination of damage is subject
to uncertainty, tribunals are authorized to apply a degree of discretion. As the
Annulment Committee in Rumeli said®*!:

“The estimation of damages [...] is not an exact science. It is of the essence of
such an exercise that the tribunal has a measure of discretion, since the final figure
must of its nature be an approximation of the claimant’s loss”.

In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that a discount of approximately 30% over the
preliminary market value appropriately reflects the risks faced by prospective buyers:
it is safe to assume that, upon foreclosure of the Mortgages, and delivery of ownership
of the Properties to Lion, willing buyers would only have been prepared to pay to Lion
approximately USD 47 M* (and not the full market value of USD 67 M) for the
purchase of the Nayarit and the Guadalajara Properties.

The Tribunal’s figure of USD 47 M is reinforced by the valuation provided by
Respondent’s expert, who used conservative parameters to establish the market price
of the Properties, and, applying a completely different methodology, arrived at a similar
figure®??,

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

Summing up, the Tribunal finds that in the But For Scenario the value of the Claimant’s
investment would have amounted to USD 47 M.

As regards the As Is Scenario, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the present value
of the investment is nil — upon cancellation in the Property Registry the Mortgages
have become extinguished and consequently worthless.

Therefore, the Tribunal determines that the compensation due to Lion, for the
impairment suffered by its protected investment — the Nayarit and Guadalajara
Mortgages — amounts to the difference in the values of the Mortgages in the But For
and the As Is valuation, i.e. USD 47,000,000 — and this is the sum awarded in
Claimant’s favour under this heading.

RESPONDENT’S ANCILLARY OBJECTIONS

Mexico submits two additional arguments to sustain that any compensation awarded to
Lion should be reduced:

SHARES IN DEBTOR COMPANIES

A. —Respondent’s position

Mexico argues that, if Lion is awarded damages in this arbitration, the Tribunal should
reduce the compensation in an amount equal to the value of the shares Lion owns in
the Debtor companies*”*.

To this date, under Mexican law, the forgery of the Settlement Agreement has not been
established and it remains legally effective. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement,
share certificates were issued in Lion’s name. Thus, Lion is the owner of these shares,
and therefore, their value must be subtracted from any compensation awarded by this
Tribunal®?>,

In the course of criminal proceeding 137/2004, Sr. Cardenas presented various expert
reports calculating the book value of Lion’s shares in order to sustain his allegation that
Lion had not suffered damages as a consequence of his criminal behaviour. Respondent
points out that, according to these reports, Lion’s shares in the Debtor companies have
a book value as of December 2012 of USD 81,8 M**°.

Respondent does not share Claimant’s position that Lion could assign its rights over
the shares to Mexico, in order to avoid double recovery. Mexico has not accepted
Claimant’s offer and this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to order that Lion’s shares be

transferred to Mexico; and even if it did, there is no assurance that this transaction could
legally take place under Mexican law*?’.

B. Claimant’s position

Claimant rejects Respondent’s proposition: Lion never acquired shares in the Debtor
companies because no legal effects arose from the Forged Settlement Agreement*”®.
The fact that the Debtors never recorded the increase of capital at the Commercial
Registry, reveals that the whole operation was a sham*”’.

In any case, the valuation of the shares proposed by Respondent has not been
established in a reliable manner. Claimant had no opportunity to rebut the reports
presented by Sr. Cardenas in the criminal proceedings, which were suspended by the
Federal Attorney-General**”.

Claimant says that, in order to avoid double recovery, it has offered to tender any rights
it may have over these shares to Mexico, upon receiving the compensation due in this
arbitration®!.

C. The Tribunal’s decision

Respondent argues that any compensation due to Lion must be reduced in an amount
equal to the value of the shares it owns in the Debtor companies. Claimant rejects this
proposition, alleging that it never acquired ownership of any such shares.

The Tribunal has already established that the Settlement Agreement, in which Lion
allegedly agreed to settle the debts owed by the Debtor companies and to cancel the
Mortgages, in exchange for shares in these companies, was a forgery**?. Quod nullum
est, nullum effectum producit. Furthermore, the increases of share capital in favour of
Lion were never recorded in the Commercial Registry, with the consequence that the
shares were never formally created**?.

Finally, Respondent has not marshalled any convincing evidence proving the value of
the shares in the Debtor companies allegedly owned by Lion. The valuation provided
by Sr. Cardenas himself, as defendant in a criminal case, is not persuasive.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

In sum, the Tribunal concludes that Mexico has failed to prove that Lion is the rightful
owner of any participation in the capital of the Debtor companies. And even if Lion
were to have validly acquired such shareholdings (quod non), the Respondent has not
marshalled convincing evidence establishing their proper value.

CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

A. The Parties’ positions

Respondent says that Lion has a chance to obtain double recovery, because it can
potentially claim reparation if Sr. Cardenas is found criminally liable for fraud in any
of the pending criminal proceedings***.

Claimant says that any hypothetical compensation that it may be awarded under the
criminal proceedings cannot prevent it from obtaining the full compensation that is due
under international law for Mexico’s breaches. In any case, Claimant argues, the issue
of double recovery in this case would be something to decide in the future by the
Mexican courts when awarding any compensation to Lion**>.

B. The Tribunal’s decision
a. Facts

On April 18, 2013 Claimant submitted its first criminal action, 463/2013, before the
criminal Court of Jalisco. The action was against Sr. Cardenas and was based on the
Forged Settlement Agreement and the request for certified copies of the Cancellation
Proceeding, through the impersonation of Mr. Arechederra. The criminal Court of
Jalisco dismissed the case for lack of sufficient evidence***.

On April 19, 2013 Lion filed a parallel action, this time before the criminal Courts of
Mexico City (137/2014). The Mexico City Court dismissed the action on the ground
that the facts were already being tried in Jalisco**’.

Lion made a third attempt, on June 19, 2015, filing another action before the Office of
the Attorney General of the State of Jalisco, which resulted in criminal proceedings
181/2016. The case was dismissed on the basis that the statute of limitations had
expired***.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

Respondent’s expert, Dr. Plascencia, declared with respect to the abovementioned
proceedings that**?:

“Del andlisis de los expedientes queda claro que Lion Mexico Consolidated,
ejercié las acciones, derecho y recursos correspondientes para tratar de
demostrar los hechos aparentemente delictivos que le atribuia a Héctor
Cardenas, sin embargo, de las resoluciones dictadas por tres diferentes jueces
penales en tres procedimientos distintos se desprende que no fue posible acreditar
de los hechos denunciados la comision de delito alguno”.

 

 

Lion was unable to obtain a criminal conviction of Sr. Cardenas, and consequently, no
reparation was granted.

Despite the above, Lion has persisted in its attempt to secure a criminal conviction
against Sr. Cardenas and has filed three additional criminal complaints that are
currently pending. At the end of the Hearing, the Tribunal requested the Parties to
inform the Tribunal on the status of these pending criminal proceedings:

- Criminal Action No. 4713/2016: in these proceedings Lion seeks a criminal
conviction of Sr. Cardenas with respect to the forgery of the Settlement
Agreement and the impersonation of Mr. Arechederra; the proceedings remain
suspended, pending two Amparos initiated by Sr. Cardenas**°;

- Criminal Action No. 121667/2017: these proceedings concern the forgery and
fraud in relation to the filing of the False Amparo; the last information available
is that the investigation phase is ongoing, and that no formal charges
(imputacion) have been issued against Sr. Cardenas**';

- Criminal Action No. 83426/2017: these proceedings concerning the sale by Sr.
Cardenas of the Nayarit Property, that was subject to a freeze order, is in the
investigation phase and no formal charges (imputacion) have been issued against
Sr. Cardenas*”.

b. Discussion
Respondent’s main argument is that Lion may obtain double recovery, since it still has

the potential right to be compensated if Sr. Cardenas is found guilty under any of the
criminal proceedings that are currently pending. Respondent says that the potential

compensation of Lion in these criminal proceedings is guaranteed by the “land freezes”
imposed by the Prosecutor on the Nayarit and Guadalajara Properties***.

To this date, however, no criminal conviction has been issued against Sr. Cardenas,
and no compensation has been awarded to Lion by any criminal Court. Respondent’s
expert acknowledges that in the current proceedings a criminal conviction of Sr.
Cardenas is unlikely*“4. The criminal Courts have already dismissed Lion’s allegations
for lack of evidence, and the statute of limitations and the principle non bis in idem
make it now highly unlikely that a criminal conviction against Sr. Cardenas be
rendered.

Since the Mexican criminal Courts have until now failed to render any decision
awarding compensation in favour of Lion, Respondent’s request that the compensation
granted in this arbitration be reduced is moot.

If in the future any Mexican criminal Court is to issue a decision in favour of Lion, and
by that time Lion has collected any of the amounts awarded in its favour in the present
arbitration, it is for the Mexican Court to adopt the appropriate measures to avoid
double recovery.

VII.2. LEGAL FEES ARISING FROM THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE

799.

800.

801.

FORECLOSURE PROCEEDING

Art. 1121(1)(b) of the NAFTA requires that, as a condition precedent to the submission
of a claim to arbitration, investors withdraw from any parallel local judicial
proceedings, except for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary proceedings not
involving the payment of damages:

“Article 1121: Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration

1. A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1116 to arbitration only
ift

L-]

(b) the investor [...] waive[s] [its] right to initiate or continue before any
administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute
settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the
disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116, except
for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not
involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court
under the law of the disputing Party.” [Emphasis added]

Lion argues that it should be compensated by Mexico for gastos, costas y perjuicios
[Legal Fees”] it may be ordered to pay to the Debtors as a result of its withdrawal
from the Foreclosure Proceeding***. Lion avers that it was required to abandon all local
proceedings to comply with the waiver requirement of NAFTA Art. 1121(1)(b), which
lists withdrawal from local proceedings as one of the conditions precedent to
submitting a NAFTA arbitration claim*°, and thus, such costs are ultimately a
consequence of Mexico’s breach.

As to the quantification of these Legal Fees, at the time of the Parties’ latest
submissions, a decision on the exact amount to be paid by Lion was pending before the
Juez de lo Civil**’, but according to an estimate by Lion, they could reach an amount
of up to USD 14 M*8,

Mexico in turn claims that Lion was not required to withdraw from the Foreclosure
Proceeding**”. In fact, the decision to withdraw was “ill-advised”, as the NAFTA Art.
1121(1)(b) withdrawal requirement did not apply to the Foreclosure Proceeding**°.

The Tribunal must, thus, analyse whether under NAFTA Art. 1121(1)(b) Lion was
required to withdraw from the Foreclosure Proceeding and whether Legal Fees ordered
by the local Courts as a consequence of such withdrawal, constitute part of the
compensation due.

To adjudicate this question, the Tribunal will first establish the proper interpretation of
Art. 1121(1)(b) of the NAFTA (1.), then it will analyse whether Lion was obliged to
withdraw the Foreclosure Proceeding (2.) and finally it will discuss whether Mexico
has to assume the Legal Fees which Claimant may eventually be forced to pay to the
Debtors (3.)

THE PROPER INTERPRETATION OF ART. 1121(1)(B) NAFTA

Art. 1121(1)(b) of the NAFTA requires that a protected investor, before accessing
international justice, must discontinue any existing parallel proceedings before the
municipal Courts, relating to the same dispute. The rationale of the rule is twofold: to
avoid contradicting decisions between the local Courts and international arbitration,
and to prevent double recovery.

The Non-Disputing Parties hold the same opinion:

US**!: “The purpose of the waiver provision is to avoid the need for a respondent
Party to litigate concurrent and overlapping proceedings in multiple forums, and
to minimize not only the risk of double recovery, but also the risk of ‘conflicting

outcomes (and thus legal uncertainty)””.
Canada***: “The purpose of this provision is to preclude parallel litigation
involving the payment of damages in order to avoid conflicting outcomes and
double redress with respect to the same measure”.

Thunderbird offers a similar, teleological clarification on how to approach Art. 1121
of the NAFTA®®:

“In construing Article 1121 of NAFTA, one must also take into account the
rationale and purpose of that article. The consent and waiver requirements set
forth in Article 1121 serve a specific purpose, namely to prevent _a party from

pursuing concurrent domestic and international remedies, which could either give
rise to conflicting outcomes (and thus legal uncertainty) or lead to double redress

for the same conduct or measure”. [Emphasis added]

In sum, under Art. 1121 NAFTA a prospective claimant is required to withdraw from
any municipal procedure, if such procedure:

- could give rise to an outcome which conflicts with the result of the investment
arbitration, or

- can result in claimant being compensated twice for the same loss or damage.

Exceptions

NAFTA Art. 1121(1)(b) contains exceptions to the general rule of withdrawal; there
are certain types of proceedings where the Treaty does not require a waiver as a
condition precedent to the investor filing an investment arbitration.

The NAFTA has been executed in English, French and Spanish, all three versions being
equally authentic**4. As regards the exceptions to the waiver requirement, there are
marked differences between the English and French texts, and the Spanish text of Art.
1121(1)(b).

In English, the exceptions to the general rule appear to concern three categories of
proceedings:

“[...] except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary
relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or
court under the law of the disputing Party”.

 

This is also the case in French:

“a l'exception d’une procedure d’injonction, d’une procédure déclaratoire ou
d'un autre recours extraordinaire, ne pas le pai de de
intéréts, entrepris devant une juridiction administrative ou judiciaire”.

 

While the Spanish version refers to one category (“medidas precautorias”, i.e.
injunctive measures) of threefold character:

“salvo los procedimientos en que se solicite la aplicacién de medidas
precautorias de cardcter_suspensivo, declaratorio_o extraordinario, que_no

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

Does a Juicio Hipotecario like the Foreclosure Proceeding fall within any of these
exceptions?

In the Tribunal’s opinion, the answer is in the negative, whatever the version of the
NAFTA Treaty is preferred (all being equally authentic).

The Juicio Hipotecario is an ordinary procedure, with the purpose of enforcing a
mortgage through the judicial sale of the property and the delivery of the price obtained
to the claimant, up to the amount and in payment of the secured debt. Consequently, a
Juicio Hipotecario is not a “medida precautoria”, as required in the Spanish version
of the rule.

If we turn to the English or French versions, the requirements for an exception are also
not met. In a Juicio Hipotecario the relief requested by claimant consists in the judicial
enforcement of the Mortgage, and the allocation of the price obtained to the payment
of the debt. The relief does not meet the requirement for the exception to apply
(“injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief”); the NAFTA rule additionally
requires that the relief does not “involv[e] the payment of damages” — a requirement
which the Juicio Hipotecario again does not meet, since foreclosure of a mortgage
involves the payment of a sum of money for the settlement of a debt.

In sum, the Foreclosure Proceeding is a Juicio Hipotecario, and as such is not included
in any of the exceptions to the general rule that parallel proceedings must be withdrawn

as a condition precedent for the filing of an investment arbitration.

LION WAS OBLIGED TO WITHDRAW THE FORECLOSURE PROCEEDIN

 

The general rule under Art. 1121(1)(b) of the NAFTA is that before bringing a NAFTA
claim, a claimant must withdraw any local proceedings “with respect” to the measure
adopted by the host State that allegedly constitutes an international wrong.
According to Lion, the wording “with respect to” should be interpreted broadly**.
Claimant argues that the Foreclosure Proceeding was intended to recover the value of
the Mortgage, i.e., the investment — the same value as the compensation it seeks to
recover in the current arbitration.

Respondent counters that the facts show that the Foreclosure Proceeding is not “with
respect to” any of the measures giving rise to Lion’s claims**°. Mexico’s argumentation

is summarized in its reiteration that “none of the measures at issue in this case have
anything to do with the Foreclosure Proceedings”*>’.

Discussion

Does the Foreclosure Proceeding meet the test of being “with respect to” the
international wrong committed by Mexico, and was Lion consequently obliged to
withdraw before commencing this investment arbitration?

Pro memoria: in April 2012 Lion filed the Foreclosure Proceeding, a Juicio
Hipotecario, before a Juez de lo Civil in Mexico D.F., seeking to enforce the Nayarit
Mortgage (but not the Guadalajara Mortgage). The purpose of the Procedure was to
realize the value of such security, by forcing its judicial sale and using the proceeds to
settle Lion’s secured and unpaid obligations. The Foreclosure Proceeding never
matured: Lion encountered numerous difficulties in the emplazamiento of the Debtors,
and the Juicio Hipotecario stalled for more than three years. Eventually, before
commencing this NAFTA arbitration, Claimant withdrew the Foreclosure Proceeding.

The international wrong committed by Mexico has been established in this Award:

- Lion was denied access to justice and was wrongfully prevented from
participating in the Cancellation Proceeding, which eventually led to the
cancellation of the Mortgages;

- Lion was also wrongfully denied the right to appeal the Cancellation Judgement;
and finally

- Lion was wrongfully denied the right to allege and prove the forgery of the
Forged Settlement Agreement,

all in breach of Art. 1105 of the NAFTA.

The Tribunal has already established that one situation where Art. 1121 NAFTA
requires a prospective claimant to withdraw a municipal procedure, is where such
procedure can result in multiple compensation for the same loss or damage.

Lion found itself precisely in that situation.
In this arbitration Lion is asking to be compensated for its total loss resulting from the

cancellation of the Nayarit Mortgage, and such loss is equal to the value of such
Mortgage.

Award

The continuation of the Foreclosure Proceeding would indeed have created a risk of
double recovery: if foreclosure of the Nayarit Mortgage had resulted in the recovery of
any amount of money, the total compensation received by Claimant would have
exceeded its total loss (equal to the value of the Mortgage and already compensated in
these proceedings).

It is precisely to minimize this risk that Art. 1121 NAFTA requires that local
proceedings be discontinued, as a condition precedent to the filing of a NAFTA
arbitration.

In_sum, the Tribunal concludes that Lion, to comply with the requirement of
Art. 1121(1)(b) and secure the admissibility of this arbitration, was obliged to withdraw
the Foreclosure Proceeding.

All that Lion did was to comply with this obligation.
DISCUSSION OF THE LEGAL FEES

An unintended consequence of the withdrawal of the Foreclosure Proceeding was the
decision of the Juez de lo Civil ordering Lion to pay the Legal Fees (“gastos, costas y
perjuicios”) suffered by the Debtor***. Despite Lion’s appeal in Amparo, Mexico’s
Supreme Court ultimately upheld the original decision***: the municipal rule which
requires that in foreclosure proceedings a withdrawing party assumes the Legal Fees
incurred by the counterparty does not contravene the NAFTA®.

At the time of the Parties’ latest submissions, a decision on the exact amount to be paid
by Lion was pending before the Juez de lo Civil**'. Lion says that the Debtor is claiming
more than USD 14M, avers that it has asserted meritorious defences to such claim, but
adds that there is a risk that the Mexican courts will mechanically apply Legal Fees in
the amount of 6% of the amount in controversy*™.

The question which the Tribunal must decide is whether these Legal Fees (in whichever
amount eventually established) have to be borne by Claimant or by Mexico.

Lion says that “but for Mexico’s breaches”, it would not have been required to waive
the Foreclosure Proceeding and would not have incurred these liabilities.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

The Tribunal has already established that the damages awarded must be sufficient (in
the words of Chorzéw) to “wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-
establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed” °°.

To do so, it is necessary to assume that Mexico had not committed any wrongful
conduct. In such case, the Nayarit Mortgage would not have been cancelled, the
Foreclosure Proceeding would eventually have been successful, the Nayarit Property
would have been foreclosed, and the price obtained would have been used to pay the
secured debts. In this scenario Lion would not have incurred any Legal Fees payable
to the Debtor.

In reality what has happened is that the Mexican Court system has incurred in a denial
of justice, which has resulted in the wrongful cancellation of the Nayarit Mortgage, and
has forced Lion to seek redress through international arbitration. This award has
already acknowledged that Lion is entitled to a compensation for the impairment of its
investment. But this compensation does not wipe out all the consequences of Mexico’s
wrongful act. As a requirement for the admissibility of this arbitration, Lion has been
forced to withdraw the Foreclosure Proceeding, and to incur certain, still to be
quantified, Legal Fees. Full reparation requires that Mexico assume the obligation of
reimbursing Lion for such Legal Fees, in the amount finally established by the Mexican
Courts and actually paid by Lion to the Debtor.

Lion, in turn, has a duty to mitigate its losses, and consequently must continue
defending the claim for Legal Fees filed by the Debtor, with the same diligence as it
would be defending its own interest, exhausting non-obviously futile local remedies.
(There is no suggestion by Mexico that Lion up to now has breached its duty to
mitigate).

3.EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE EXHAUSTION OF LOCAL

REMEDIES

 

840. Lion claims that, apart from the costs incurred in the arbitration®™, it is also entitled to

recover its legal fees and expenses incurred in the Mexican proceedings, which amount
to USD 2,212,004.53%°,

841.

Mexico disputes the number proposed by Lion. According to Mexico, Lion initially
averred that its attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in local proceedings amounted to
USD 1,262,650, to suddenly increase that number to USD 2,212,004.53 without
justification’.

842. Mexico additionally argues that the sole evidence supporting Lion’s claim, an affidavit
by Ms. Rodriguez, the Senior Vice President/Controller of Lion’s parent company,
providing that

“[t]o the best of [her] knowledge, the true and accurate amount of fees incurred
by L[ion] for these matters to date is US 2,2,12,004.53”*°”,

is insufficient. Mexico points out that the affidavit is not accompanied by any
explanation or supporting documentation, which confirms the accuracy of the proposed
number. Additionally, Ms. Rodriguez was not a witness in the arbitration and since she
was not cross-examined at the Hearing, Mexico would be severely prejudiced if the
Tribunal took her statement to be accurate.

843. Thus, Mexico requests that the Tribunal dismiss the claim for damages for the legal
fees and expenses incurred by Lion in the local proceedings*®*.

Decision of the Tribunal

844. Lion asks that Mexico reimbursed it an amount of USD 2,212,004.53, representing

only evidence marshalled is a two-paragraph affidavit, executed by Ms. Karen
Rodriguez, the Senior Vice President/Controller of Lion’s parent company, stating that

“to the best of my knowledge and belief, the true and accurate amount of fees
incurred by [Lion] for these matters [the Amparo Proceeding and the defense
against Sr. Cardenas’ claim for Legal Fees] is US$2,212,004.53” *”.

Ms. Rodriguez has not provided any further evidence or details. No invoices are
attached. The evidence was not submitted by means of a witness statement confirming
her calculations, nor has Ms. Rodriguez appeared before this Tribunal to aver her
declaration.

The Tribunal does not consider that the evidence submitted by Claimant is sufficient
to support a claim for legal fees of more than USD 2 M, allegedly incurred before the
Mexican Courts, in the course of defending its rights in the Amparo and in the
Foreclosure Proceeding.

In any case, even assuming arguendo that Lion would have satisfied its burden of
proving the legal fees incurred in the local proceedings, the Tribunal is not convinced
that Mexico should bear these costs. The Tribunal has already established that a claim
for denial of justice requires the aggrieved party to exhaust local remedies*’!. If the
exhaustion of local remedies had resulted in the Mexican judiciary correcting the
wrongful cancellation of the Mortgages, the denial of justice would have been
prevented — but Claimant would still have incurred local legal fees. Whether legal fees
incurred in municipal procedures filed by the investor can be recovered and from
whom, is a question to be settled by municipal law*””.

ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2

VII.4. CONCLUSION

Claimant is seeking three categories of compensation:

The first category is the impairment suffered by Lion’s investment (the Nayarit and the
Guadalajara Mortgages), caused by Mexico’s breach of the NAFTA obligations, such
impairment to be calculated as the difference in the value of the Mortgages in the But
For Scenario and in the As Is Scenario.

The Tribunal has concluded that in the But For Scenario the value of the Claimant’s
investment would have amounted to USD 47 M, while the value of the investment in
the As Is Scenario is nil, the Mortgages having become extinguished and worthless.
The compensation due to Lion, for the impairment suffered by its protected investment,
amounts to the difference between both values, i.e., USD 47,000,000 — and this is the
sum awarded in Claimant’s favour under this heading.

The second category are certain Legal Fees which Claimant says could arise as a
consequence of the withdrawal of the Foreclosure Proceeding.

In the Tribunal’s opinion, Lion was forced to withdraw the Foreclosure Proceeding in
order to commence this NAFTA arbitration and to incur certain, still to be quantified,
Legal Fees as a requirement for the admissibility of this arbitration under the NAFTA.
Full reparation requires that Mexico assume the obligation of reimbursing Lion for
such Legal Fees, in the amount finally established by the Mexican Courts and actually
paid by Lion to the Debtors.

Lion, in turn, has a duty to mitigate its losses, and consequently must continue
defending the claim for Legal Fees filed by the Debtors, with the same diligence as it
would be defending its own interest, exhausting non-obviously futile local remedies.

The third category are certain expenses and fees incurred in the exhaustion of local
remedies, which Claimant says amount to more than USD 2 M.

The Tribunal has dismissed this claim for lack of evidence and, subsidiarily, because
the question of whether legal fees incurred by the investor in pursuing municipal
procedures can be recovered, and from whom, is a question to be settled by municipal
law in the very proceedings where the legal fees arise.

VIII. INTEREST

The Parties agree that the Tribunal should award interest as part of the compensation,
if a breach is found to have occurred and the payment of compensation is ordered. They
disagree, however, on the applicable interest rate, and whether the interest should be
compounded.

CLAIMANT’S POSITION
Claimant seeks interest under the following conditions®*”*:

First, full reparation requires payment of appropriate interest on any amounts awarded,
in accordance with Art. 38(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. If the
Claimant is to be kept economically whole, the amount of the final damages awarded
must accrue interest*”:

Second, the Mexican legal rate for commercial debts in default provided by Art. 362 of
the Mexican Commercial Code (i.e., 6% per year) compounded on a monthly basis is
warranted. Alternatively, Lion’s interest should be that used by Mexican Amparo
courts when awarding damages, i.e., the 28-day Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate
(TITE)S75,

Third, interest should accrue from 31 March 2015 until the date of full and effective
payment*”®,

RESPONDENT’S POSITION

Mexico does not dispute that the Claimant would be entitled to interest on any amounts
awarded, should the Tribunal hold Mexico liable for a breach of its obligations under
the NAFTA. It also does not dispute that interest would be due from the date of the
breach until the date in which the award is paid. Yet Mexico disagrees about the
following aspects*”’:

First, the interest rate must be consistent with the currency in which the award is
granted. Thus, for an award denominated in U.S. dollars, a relatively low or risk-free
rate would be that of the U.S. Treasury Bills, and for an award denominated in Mexican
pesos, it should be the 28-day CETES rate — Certificados de la Tesoreria de la

Federecion*"*, In any case, it would be utterly inappropriate to apply a Mexican peso
rate to a U.S. denominated amount, as the Claimant proposes.

Second, on the issue of how pre- and post-award interest should be calculated, there is
no international consensus on whether interest should be calculated using simple or
compounded interest. In the circumstances of this case, the Claimant should not be
rewarded with compound interest*”’.

Third, there is no consensus among the tribunals that have ordered compound interest
as to the compounding period, although the vast majority have opted for annual
compounding. Thus, should the Tribunal opt for compounded interest, it should be
annual compounding and not monthly compounding**®.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION
Article 1135 NAFTA says that

“Where a Tribunal makes a final award against a Party, the Tribunal may award

(a) monetary damages and any applicable interest [...]”.

In line with this provision, prior NAFTA tribunals have recognized that interest forms
an essential limb of the compensation due for a breach of the Treaty. The tribunal in
Metalclad, for instance, stated that**!:

“interest becomes an integral part of the compensation itself, and should run
consequently from the date when the State’s international responsibility became
engaged”.

The Parties also agree that this Tribunal may award interest over the compensation
ordered. The Parties, however, disagree on the applicable rate and the method of
calculation of interest.

The Tribunal’s decision on interest, thus, must determine the applicable interest rate
and the methodology for their calculation. The Tribunal must also fix the dies a quo,
dies ad quem and the principal amount.

Since the Tribunal has determined that the compensation due to Lion is USD 47 M,
that is the “Principal Amount”.

INTEREST RATE

Claimant has requested that interest be granted over the Principal Amount at the
Mexican legal rate for commercial debts in default provided for by Art. 362 of the
Mexican Commercial Code (i.e., 6% per year); or alternatively, the 28-day Interbank
Equilibrium Interest Rate (TIIE), used by the Mexican Amparo courts when awarding
damages.

Respondent says that the Tribunal should grant the rate applicable to U.S. Treasury
Bills; and if the compensation is awarded in Mexican pesos, the rate should be the 28-
day CETES rate.

The NAFTA does not establish an applicable interest rate for the compensation
awarded by a tribunal for breaches of Article 1105 NAFTA. But Article 1110(4)
NAFTA, which governs the appropriate compensation in cases of expropriation,
provides that if payment is made in any G7 currency (and the USD forms part of this
group of currencies), interest is to accrue at a commercially reasonable rate:

“Tf payment is made in a G7 currency, compensation shall include interest at a
commercially reasonable rate for that currency [...]”. [Emphasis of the Tribunal]

In Archer Daniels the tribunal by analogy applied a “commercially reasonable rate” to
a compensation due for breach of Article 1102 NAFTA (national treatment) and 1106
NAFTA (performance requirement)***. In this case, the Tribunal shares the opinion
that Article 1110(4) NAFTA may serve as guidance in a case consisting in the breach
of the FET standard.

The rates proposed in this case by the Parties are not appropriate:

First, Claimant is claiming compensation denominated in USD, but it is requesting the
Tribunal to award interests at a rate intended to be applied to a much weaker currency,
the MEX, to debts denominated in MEX. This proposal is a non sequitur. The principle
that the interest rate must be consistent with the currency of the principal is
acknowledged in Article 1110(4) of the NAFTA, which states that “[i]f payment is
made in a G7 currency, compensation shall include interest at a commercially
reasonable rate for that currency ...”.

Second, Respondent does propose a rate applicable to debt in USD, such as the rate
applicable to U.S. Treasury Bills; however, this is not a “commercially reasonable rate”
— it is the rate accrued for financing the US Government, not for financing commercial
enterprises.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

The Tribunal is of the view that LIBOR is the most widely use “commercially
reasonable rate”, since it is universally accepted as a valid reference for the calculation
of variable interest rates. LIBOR is determined by the equilibrium between supply and
demand, representing the interest rate at which banks can borrow funds from other
banks in the London interbank market; it is fixed daily by the British Bankers’
Association for different maturities and for different currencies.

Since the compensation is expressed in USD, the appropriate rate of reference for the
calculation of interest should be LIBOR rates for six-month deposits denominated in
USD.

LIBOR reflects the interest rate at which banks lend to each other money. Loans to
customers invariably include a surcharge, and this surcharge must be inserted in the
calculation of interest to reflect the financial loss caused to Lion by the temporary
withholding of money. In the present market situation, the Tribunal finds that a margin
of 2% is an appropriate margin, reflecting the surcharge that an average borrower
would have to pay for obtaining financing based on LIBOR**.

CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

Lion has requested that interest should be compounded monthly, while Mexico
proposes that simple interest be applied. Alternatively, Mexico says that if the Tribunal
were to award compound interest, compounding ought to be carried out annually.

The question whether interest should be accumulated periodically to the principal has
been the subject of diverging decisions in international investment case law. Older case
law*** tended to repudiate this possibility, but more recent case law tends to accept
annual or semi-annual capitalisation of unpaid interest.**>

The Tribunal agrees with the more recent decisions. Loan agreements in which interest
is calculated on the basis of LIBOR plus a margin usually include a provision that
unpaid interest must be capitalized at the end of the interest period, and will thereafter
be considered as capital and accrue interest. The financial reason for this provision is
that an unpaid lender has to resort to the LIBOR market in order to fund the amounts
due but defaulted, and the lender’s additional funding costs have to be covered by the
defaulting borrower.

This principle implies that, if Claimant had taken out a LIBOR loan to anticipate the
amount to which it is entitled under this Award, the bank would have insisted that
unpaid interest be capitalised at the end of each interest period. Consequently, if

Claimant is to be kept fully indemnified for the harm suffered, interest owed under the
Award should be capitalised at the end of each 6-month interest period.

The Tribunal, thus, decides that due and unpaid interest shall be capitalized semi-
annually, from the dies a quo.

DIES A QUO AND DIES AD QUEM

The Parties agree that interest shall accrue from the date of the breach until the date in
which the award is paid®*®.

The Tribunal has already established that Mexico’s denial of justice occurred over
several instances, beginning with the Cancellation Judgment issued by the Juez de lo
Mercantil, which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of the Mortgages on September
7 and October 16, 2012. The Tribunal has taken these dates as the valuation dates for
establishing the value of the investments**’. These dates also represent the proper dies
a quo. To simplify calculation, the Tribunal decides that interest should start to accrue
on October 1, 2012.

In light of the above, the Tribunal determines that the dies a quo shall be October 1,
2012 and the dies ad quem the date of effective payment.

eR

In summary, the Tribunal decides that from October 1, 2012 until the date of payment,
the principal amount of USD 47 M shall accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR for 6-month
deposits denominated in USD, plus a 2% margin, compounded semi-annually, from
the dies a quo.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION
Art. 58 of the Arbitration Rules of Additional Facility establishes that

“(1) Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by
whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and
charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection
with the proceeding shall be borne [...].

CRITERIA FOR THE DECISION ON COSTS

Neither the Arbitration Rules of Additional Facility nor the NAFTA establish defined
criteria for the apportionment of costs. Art. 58 of the Arbitration Rules of Additional
Facility grant wide discretion to the Tribunal to decide how the costs of this arbitration
shall be allocated.

Both Parties have requested that the other bear the costs of the proceedings. Claimant
suggests that the Tribunal should apply the principle of “costs follow the event”*>.
Respondent has not opposed this proposition.

The Tribunal will adopt the principle that costs follows the event.

As regards the outcome of this procedure, each Party can legitimately claim that it has
succeeded in part:

- Claimant partially succeeded in the jurisdictional phase, because the Tribunal
accepted that the Mortgages qualified as a protected investment; however,
Respondent also partially prevailed, to the extent that the Tribunal accepted
Mexico’s objection that the Notes were not protected investments.

- On the merits of the case Lion succeeded in its claim that Mexico breached
Article 1105 NAFTA;

- On damages, Claimant requested compensation of USD 98.2 M*?°. Respondent
argued that, if any compensation was due, it could not be greater than
USD 47 M®**’; the Tribunal concluded, albeit with a different argumentation than
that defended by Mexico, that the proper amount of compensation was indeed
USD 47M.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

Taking into account that Lion has partially prevailed in its request for relief, the
Tribunal decides that Mexico shall bear part of Claimant’s costs.

APPLICATION OF THE “COST FOLLOW THE EVENT” PRINCIPLE

The Tribunal will apply the principle that costs follow the event to the two main
categories of Claimant’s costs: the Costs of the Proceedings and the Defence Expenses.

Costs of the Proceedings

The Costs of the Proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the
Tribunal’s Assistant, ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to:

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Prof. Juan Fernandez-Armesto USD 424,684.78
Prof. Laurence Boisson de Chazournes USD 132,136.64
Mr. David. J.A. Cairns USD 156,003.69
Mr. Ricardo Ramirez Hernandez USD 39,675.00
Mr. Luis Fernando Rodriguez (expenses) USD 12,777.47
ICSID’s administrative fees USD 242,000.00
Direct expenses (estimated) USD 159,920.24
Total USD 1,167,197.82

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal
parts**’. As a result, each Party’s share of the Costs of the Proceedings amounts to
USD 583,598.91.

Lion claims the Costs of the Proceedings, i.e., the advances made by the Parties to
cover the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and administrative fees of ICSID.

Claimant has succeeded in the overall outcome of the proceedings. The Tribunal, thus,
finds that these costs should be assumed by Respondent.

88 The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to
ICSID.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Award

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Mexico must reimburse Claimant the totality of
the Costs of the Proceeding paid by Claimant to ICSID (net of any final reimbursements
made by ICSID).

Defense Expenses

As a first step, the Tribunal must establish the amount of reasonable defense expenses
which a standard claimant has to incur, in order to properly present and defend its claim
[Reasonable Defense Expenses”]. Taking into consideration the complexity of the
case, the amount in dispute and the work legal counsel and experts, the Tribunal
considers that the Parties’ Reasonable Defense Expenses amount to USD 3M.

Mexico must only assume that part of Claimant’s Reasonable Defense Expenses that
results from applying the principle that costs follow the event. To determine such

amount, the Tribunal must:

- First, determine the main issues that have been decided;

 

- Second, give each legal issue a ponderation; and

 

- Third, determine the success rate of Claimant’s claims in each legal issue and
apply it to Claimant’s Reasonable Defense Expenses.

In this arbitration, the Tribunal has made two significant decisions:

- Whether it had jurisdiction over the Mortgages and the Notes;

- Whether Mexico breached the NAFTA and the consequences thereof.

Claimant declared to have dedicated approximately 25% of their costs to the

jurisdiction phase, while the remaining 75% to merits and quantum*”’. Thus, the

Tribunal will assign each of the legal issues the weight apportioned by Claimant:

- Jurisdiction: 25% of USD 3 M amounts to USD 750,000;

- Merits and quantum: 75% of USD 3M amounts to USD 2,250,000.

The Tribunal must now determine Claimant’s rate of success in each legal issue:

- Jurisdiction: Claimant was successful in 50% of the jurisdictional objections,
since the Tribunal accepted jurisdiction over the Mortgages, but rejected

jurisdiction over the Notes; the Tribunal considers Claimant’s success rate in the
jurisdiction phase of 50%.

Award

- Merits and quantum: Claimant was successful in its relief regarding Mexico’s
liability for denial of justice; with respect to the assessment of damages, the
Tribunal granted approximately half of the amount claimed; in light of the
foregoing, the Tribunal finds Claimant’s success rate in the merits and quantum
phase to be 60%.

The Tribunal will now apply the success rate to Claimant’s Reasonable Defense
Expenses for each legal issue:

- Jurisdiction: 50% of USD 750,000, which amounts to USD 375,000.

- Merits and Quantum: 60% of USD 2,250,000, which amounts to USD 1,350,000.
INTEREST

Claimant has requested that interest be granted over the amounts awarded as costs””°.

The Tribunal agrees.

The Tribunal has already decided that the compensation awarded to Lion shall accrue
interest at a rate of LIBOR for 6-month deposits denominated in USD plus a 2%
margin, compounded semi-annually.

The same shall apply to the amounts Mexico is ordered to reimburse as costs.
The dies a quo shall be the date of issuance of this Award.

The dies ad quem shall be the date of effective payment.

KOK

In summary, Mexico shall reimburse Claimant (i) the Costs of the Proceedings paid by
Claimant in the amount of USD 583,598.91 and (ii) USD 1,725,000 as Defense
Expenses, plus (iii) interest on both amounts at a rate of LIBOR for six-months deposits
denominated in USD, with a margin of 2%, compounded semi-annually from the date
of this Award until the date of payment.

Ii. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

THE REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION AND ACCESS TO ICSID ADDITIONAL FACILITY

 

On December 11, 2015, ICSID received Lion’s RfA against the United Mexican States,
together with 20 factual exhibits*.

The RfA was made pursuant to Arts. 1116, 1120, and 1122 NAFTA‘. It included a request
for approval of access to the Additional Facility of the Centre.

On December 23, 2015 the Secretary-General registered the RfA and approved access to
the Additional Facility pursuant to Art. 4 of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. In
accordance with Article 5(e) ICSID AF Rules, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to
proceed as soon as possible to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.

THE CONSTITUTION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

Article 1123 NAFTA specifies the number of arbitrators and the method of their
appointment to constitute a Tribunal: unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, the
Tribunal shall comprise three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party, and a
presiding arbitrator appointed by agreement of the parties.

On March 10, 2016 the Claimant appointed Mr. David J. A. Cairns, a national of the United
Kingdom and New Zealand, as an arbitrator in this case. Mr. Cairns accepted his
appointment and provided his curriculum vitae.

On May 10, 2016 the Respondent appointed Mr. Ricardo Ramirez Hernandez, a national of
Mexico, as an arbitrator in this case. Mr. Ramirez Hernandez accepted his appointment and
provided his curriculum vitae.

After the Parties failed to reach an agreement on the presiding arbitrator, in accordance with
Article 1124 NAFTA, the Secretary-General served as appointing authority. On July 20,
2016, the Secretary-General appointed Juan Fernandez-Armesto, a national of Spain, as
President of the Tribunal. Pursuant to Arts. 11(2) and 13 ICSID AF Rules, Mr. Fernandez-
Armesto accepted the appointment by letter of July 27, 2016, attaching his declaration of
independence and impartiality.

On July 27, 2016, the Secretary-General confirmed the Arbitral Tribunal had been
constituted and the proceedings were deemed to have begun. The Parties confirmed at the
first session—held on September 26, 2016—that the Tribunal had been properly constituted

submission of pleadings and evidence, that the place of the proceeding would be determined
in a separate order, and that Dr. Luis Fernando Rodriguez would serve as the Assistant to
the Tribunal. Annex A to the Order set out the Procedural Calendar for this arbitration.

Decision on Jurisdiction

 

Iv. SUMMARY OF THE RELEVANT FACTS

This section describes the factual background of the transactions carried out by Lion in
Mexico. The Tribunal has made no independent enquiry or investigation into the facts. The
summary is based on Claimant’s account, which Mexico does not dispute: “Los hechos en
si mismos”, Mexico points out in its last submission, “no se encuentran en disputa’*. It is
the legal assessment of these facts that is at issue.

LION MEETS MR. CARDENAS

Claimant, Lion Mexico Consolidated LP, is a limited partnership constituted under the laws
of Quebec (Canada), with its main place of business in Texas (USA). Lion was created and
is managed by Clarion Partners, L.P. [“Clarion”], a real estate investment management
company founded in New York in 1982, which manages real estate investments for
institutional investors”.

Lion has been making investments in Mexico for over ten years. Over that period, Lion has
provided more than US $800 million of capital to entities doing business in Mexico, to be
used in developing a wide array of real estate properties, such as hotels, office buildings,
residences, warehouses, and resorts”®.

Clarion engaged Real Capital Investment Management to identify and present investment
opportunities in Mexico’’, and through this channel Mr. Héctor Cardenas Curiel, a Mexican
businessman, was introduced to Lion and Clarion?*. Mr. Cardenas was presented as a
developer seeking funding for the development of two real estate development projects: the
Nayarit Project and the Guadalajara Project.

MR. CARDENAS’S PROJECTS

The Nayarit Project [“Nayarit Project”] included an ocean-front residential and resort
development in Bahia de Banderas, State of Nayarit?®. The development plan called for a
mixed-use high-end resort to be anchored by a Ritz Carlton hotel, 1,500 luxury residential
units, extensive amenities offerings, and two ocean-front golf courses, among other features
to be developed on 855 hectares (2,100 acres) with 2.8 miles of ocean frontage*’.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

The Guadalajara Project [Guadalajara Project”]*! consisted of two high-end mixed-use
skyscrapers [“Américas I” and “Américas II”’], which were to be built on approximately
15,000 m? (3.74 acres) in the city of Guadalajara, State of Jalisco*”.

Mr. Cardenas’s plans for the development of the Nayarit Project and the Guadalajara Project
were preliminary and incomplete at the time he requested capital from Lion to acquire land
and begin limited infrastructure development®’. Lion was willing to provide capital for the
development of these projects subject to requirements including the following:

- The granting of mortgages to Lion over the land acquired by Mr. Cardenas and on the
subsequent improvements made on that land*4; and

- The issue of promissory notes to Lion as unconditional commitments to repay the
money owed to Lion, with certain procedural privileges under Mexican law*>.

THE THREE SETS OF TRANSACTIONS

In February, June, and September 2007, Lion made three loans for financing the purchase
of the properties for the Nayarit Project and the Guadalajara Project [the Loans”], as well
as working capital. Lion provided the Loans to two Mexican companies owned or controlled
by Mr. Cardenas [“the Borrowers”):

- Inmobiliaria Bains, S.A. de C.V. [Inmobiliaria Bains”),
- C&C Capital, S.A. de C.V. [“C&C Capital”).

The three Loans, with a principal amount of approximately US $32.8 million, were secured
by three mortgages and the issue of three promissory notes.

The three promissory notes [the “Notes”] were all issued under Mexican law, drafted both
in English and Spanish (with the Spanish version governing) and submitted to the exclusive
and irrevocable jurisdiction of the courts of Mexico, D.F.

The three mortgages [the “Mortgages’”’] were signed before a notary public, in Spanish
language and subject to Mexican law, namely, the applicable laws of the States of Jalisco
[“Guadalajara Mortgages 1 and 2”] and Nayarit [“Nayarit Mortgage”]*°.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

The Guadalajara Mortgage 2 was recorded at that Property Public Registry on 6 December
2007.

THE DEFAULTS

The initial deadlines for repayment of all three Loans were not met. Mr. Cardenas requested
and obtained a series of time extensions: from March 2008 through July 2009, Lion signed
maturity date extensions on the First Loan four times*', on the Second Loans seven times”,
and on the Third Loan six times®.

The last payment date on the three transactions was, ultimately, September 30, 2009, and
the debtors failed to satisfy the outstanding amounts by that date. All three Loans were
declared in default and interest at the default rate began to accrue on October 1, 2009.

Lion sent its first invoice to Mr. Cardenas for the outstanding principal and interest
payments due on April 16, 2010°4. The amounts due on that invoice, calculated and dated
as of March 31, 2010, totaled US $26,618,972 for the Nayarit Project and US $29,649,835
for the Guadalajara Project.

Subsequent invoices were sent on July 14, 2010**; October 11, 2010°°; February 14, 2011°”;
April 12, 2011, and July 29, 2011°°.

The amounts due on the latest invoices sent, calculated and dated as of June 30, 2011, were
US $36,041,328.45 for the Nayarit Project and US $40,065,210.38 for the Guadalajara
Project.

According to Lion, no payments were ever made.

LATER DEVELOPMENTS

In view of the defaults, in February 2012 Lion sought to enforce its rights judicially. In the
following years Lion repeatedly filed legal actions before the Mexican courts. Lion submits
that the Mexican courts and public registries engaged in improper conduct, allowing a fraud
based upon a forged loan restructuring agreement, which resulted in the unlawful
cancellation of Lion’s Mortgages and Notes. In its words at the hearing™.

Decision on Jurisdiction

“Unfortunately, Cardenas failed to move forward with these Projects as planned and
didn’t repay the capital as required under the Contract with [Lion]. As you know, [Lion]
has alleged that it was wrongfully stripped off its Mortgages and Notes by the
fraudulent conduct of various Mexican courts and public registries over a period of
three years ...”

Lion has brought this arbitration against Mexico under NAFTA to address the unlawful
taking of its property (allegedly, a violation of Art. 1110 NAFTA) and Mexico’s failure to
provide fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security (Art. 1105 NAFTA).
Lion is asking the Tribunal to issue an award for damages representing the value of its
investment, lost as a result of Mexico’s breach of NAFTA.

Vv. RELIEF SOUGHT

93. In its Memorial, Lion submitted the following request for relief*':

“The Claimant respectfully request the Tribunal:

a) To declare that Mexico has breached its obligations under Articles 1110 and 1115 of
NAFTA and international law;

b) To order Mexico to pay the Claimant the loss caused by the cancellation of the
Mortgages in the amount of US $76,343,347.00 or, alternatively, US $74,706,873;

f) To order Mexico to reimburse Claimants all their reasonable legal costs and fees in
connection with this arbitration; and

g) Any other remedies that the Tribunal consider appropriate in the circumstances given
Mexico’s breaches”.

94. In its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Lion asked the Tribunal for the following relief**:

“140. For the reasons discussed above, the Claimant respectfully requests the Arbitral
Tribunal to issue a decision on jurisdiction rejecting Mexico’s Jurisdictional Objection
and declaring that the Mortgages and Notes are indeed investments under NAFTA
Article 1139; and, consequently that it has ratione materiae jurisdiction to adjudicate
the claims brought by the Claimant; thus ordering the proceedings to continue and the
Respondent to file the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial in the period remaining,
according with the Amended Timetable.

141. The Claimant also requests the Arbitral Tribunal to order the Respondent to pay
all of the costs of the arbitration including the costs of representation associated with
the Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation and with the jurisdictional phase”.

VI. POSITION OF THE PARTIES

97. Under Art. 45 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules “the Tribunal shall have the
power to rule on its competence”.

98. Mexico asks the Tribunal to rule that it lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae and ratione
personae, arguing that Lion never made an investment in Mexico within the terms required
by Art. 1139 NAFTA and consequently failed to qualify as a protected investor under the

Treaty.

100. It is undisputed that the three Loans that Lion made to Inmobiliaria Bains and to C&C
Capital, two companies not affiliated with the investor (Lion), do not qualify as investments
under the NAFTA: Art. 1139(d) requires that loans to unaffiliated enterprises have an

101.

original maturity of “at least three years”®°

. And none of the Loans meets this threshold.

Claimant’s argument is different. The Loans, documented in the Credit Agreements, were
additionally secured by the Mortgages and formalized in the Notes (pagarés no
negociables). Lion says that the Mortgages and the Notes by themselves qualify as protected

investments:

- the Mortgages under Art. 1139(g), as “intangible real estate”, and

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

- the Notes under Art. 1139(h), which extends coverage to “interests arising from the
commitment of capital”®’.

Mexico disagrees and avers that Lion only made three short-term Loans, which constitute a
single economic transaction that does not meet the three-year maturity threshold for the
inclusion of loans as an investment within the meaning of Art. 1139(d). The fact that Lion
chose to secure the Loans by the issue of the Notes, and the granting of the Mortgages does
not, in Mexico’s submission, change the conclusion: there is one single economic
transaction and one single investment.

The Tribunal will first summarize Respondent’s (1.) and Claimant’s (2.) positions, and then
briefly address the experts’ opinions (3.).

RESPONDENT’S POSITION

Mexico says that Claimant made no valid investment under Art. 1139 NAFTA and therefore
the Tribunal lacks ratione personae and ratione materiae jurisdiction to hear Lion’s claims.

Mexico’s position turns on the following arguments:
- Lion’s actual investment was to lend three short-term loans only (1.);
- The Notes, Mortgages, and Loans are part of a single legal transaction (2.);

- The Mortgages and Notes do not qualify as investments under Art. 1139 NAFTA (3.).

LION’S ACTUAL INVESTMENT WAS TO MAKE THREE SHORT-TERM LOANS ONLY

The sole economic operation carried out by Lion was to make three short-term loans to
Mexican entities, an operation that does not qualify as a protected investment under Art.
1139 NAFTA, as acknowledged by Claimant**. The three Loans were documented through
three instruments, with the sole purpose of securing payment of the debt — this is their raison
d’étre® —and they cannot be considered as separate investments”’. The definition of “loans”
in Art. 1139(d) NAFTA includes loans documented in notes and secured by mortgages.
Since the Loans in the present case have a maturity date of less than three years, they do not
constitute investments. This should be the end of the analysis”!.

The following facts and legal arguments support this conclusion:

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Ca jo. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

 

First, Lion did not intend to invest in promissory notes or mortgages. The language of the
Credit Agreements makes clear that the Notes and the Mortgages were an express condition
to grant each Loan”. In fact, each Loan was implemented through a Credit Agreement, a
Note, and one or more Mortgages”.

Second, the definition of “Credit Documents” under the Credit Agreements expressly
includes not only the Credit Agreements, but also the Mortgages and the Notes”. Each Loan
was subject to the conditions set out in the Credit Agreements, and “any other applicable
conditions ... under any other Credit Documents”, which include its respective Note and
Mortgage — Credit Agreements, Notes and Mortgage are therefore deemed to be part of the
same operation”.

 

Third, the terms of the Notes and of the Mortgages just mirror the terms of the Credit
Agreements as to their parties, date of execution, amount of principal, due date, ordinary
interest rate, default interest rate, etc. These Notes and Mortgages provide Lion with an
additional mechanism to recover the debt generated by the Loans. Accordingly, the Notes
cannot constitute a separate or independent debt”®.

The several extensions granted by Lion to their debtors confirm the fact that the Notes only
document the debt created by the Loans. Each extension was implemented through the
amendment of the Credit Agreements, which required the cancellation and delivery of the
Notes to the creditor and the execution of a new Note in the terms established in the relevant
Credit Agreement”’.

MORTGAGES, NOTES, AND LOANS: ONE SINGLE LEGAL TRANSACTION

 

If the Loans did not exist, the Notes and the Mortgages would not exist either, as their
existence and economic value depends on the Loans”*. The validity and enforceability of a
promissory note or a mortgage depends on the existence of the debt or obligation
guaranteed. Once the loans are paid back, the security right of mortgage and the promissory
note lose their purpose and become unenforceable”. In this case, the Mortgages were mere
accessory contracts”,

In fact, the subject matter of the debtor’s obligation is the same in the three legal acts:
formalizing or securing the repayment of the Loans. This confirms the link between the
three legal acts in such a way that it is not possible to talk about three independent

transactions or negotia with independent economic value. The fact that each legal act is
governed by a different legal regime does not change this conclusion. To find otherwise
would amount to conclude that three different debts exist*!.

Furthermore, the mortgage is a security right created in real property that is never delivered
to or owned by the creditor®, the only right conferred by the mortgage is a preferential right
to get paid from the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property**. This conclusion is not
different even if, as in this case, the Civil Codes of Nayarit and Jalisco consider the mortgage
as real property*4.

Finally, the fact that mortgages and promissory notes have each its own legal features is
irrelevant; it just means that payment of the one debt can be obtained through different
avenues before the courts in case of the debtor’s default**. But it does not turn the Notes,
the Mortgages, and the Loans into independent operations*®.

Consequently, as part of a single legal transaction, the Notes and the Mortgages are subject
to the same legal requirements as the Loans to become a protected investment under Art.
1139(d); hence, the requisite of the three-year duration also applies to the Notes and
Mortgages, as the instruments securing the Loans*’.

Correct interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA
A correct interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA further reinforces the above conclusion:

First, if the Notes and the Mortgages could be considered separately, that would allow
protection of any loans — regardless of their original maturity — by just adding a security or
an instrument. This was not the intention of NAFTA signatories**. The parties to NAFTA
sought to restrict the protection to those loans that fulfill the requirements of Art. 1139(d)
NAFTA®. Claimant’s interpretation would cause an absurd anomaly: unguaranteed loans
would be subject to the three-year requirement, while guaranteed loans would not; and it
would also allow the protection of loans to State enterprises (which are expressly excluded),
provided they are guaranteed by a mortgage or another security right”.

Second, a consistent, comprehensive interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA under the
principles of Art. 31.1 the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties [“WCLT”] demands
to read the provision and its paragraphs (d), (g) and (h) jointly and therefore, to link and
apply the three-year requirement to the Mortgages and the Notes as well®!. This
interpretation gives meaning collectively to the three paragraphs, whilst Lion’s
interpretation suggests that paragraph (d) only refers to non-guaranteed loans, which is
wrong as it adds language to the text”.

Summing up, a correct interpretation leads to the conclusion that the three-year restriction
of paragraph (d) of Art. 1139 NAFTA also applies to security rights and promissory notes
that guarantee loans. If a mortgage or promissory note is not linked to a loan, the three-year
requirement is not relevant; but if the guaranteed asset is a loan, the correct interpretation
requires that a consistent meaning is given to Art. 1139 NAFTA as a whole”™.

MORTGAGES AND NOTES ARE NOT INVESTMENTS UNDER ART. 1139 NAFTA

Even if the Mortgages and the Notes were considered as separate investments from the
Loans, neither of them fits within the definitions of Arts. 1139(g) and 1139(h) NAFTA:
the ordinary meaning of paragraphs (g) and (h) exclude the Mortgages and the Notes from
their scope”*.

As for the Mortgages, they are not property but rights in rem. Due to its own nature, a
mortgage cannot be considered “bienes raices u otra propiedad tangible o intangible” under
Art. 1139(g) NAFTA. Their purpose is to secure the payment of the loan up to the secured
amount, and they are activated after the debtor’s default only. They are thus contingent
rights”.

Lion wrongly argues that the definition of “property” must be established under Mexican
law’, Yet the local law of a signatory cannot be used to interpret the Treaty: the
interpretation must be carried out from the language itself of NAFTA, taking into account
the ordinary meaning of the text and taking into account the context, object, and purpose of
NAFTA and the principle of effet utile, as demanded by Art. 31 of VCLT’’.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

 

CLAIMANT’S POSITION

Lion contends that the Mortgages and the Notes constitute valid investments under Art.
1139(g) and Art. 1139(h) NAFTA, respectively. Therefore, the Tribunal has both ratione
materiae jurisdiction and ratione personae jurisdiction to adjudicate the present dispute.

Lion’s position can be summarized as follows: under Mexican law, the Loans, the Notes,
and the Mortgages constitute three different negotia (1.). It follows that Mortgages and
Notes are “investments” under Art. 1139(g) and 1139(h) NAFTA (2.).

LOANS, NOTES, AND MORTGAGES CONSTITUTE THREE DIFFERENT NEGOTIA

Three different negotia were concluded in this case: the Loans, the Notes, and the
Mortgages”®. The three negotia are related but still different and separate”. Mexico’s
reasoning is flawed for various reasons!”°:

First, independence does not mean that notes or mortgages must each create a new
obligation. The Notes and the Mortgages are separate negotia from the Loans, with different
objects and different parties (in the case of the Mortgages) and separate legal regimes'®!. In
fact, mortgages are a right in rem, effective erga omnes, which allows the creditor to follow
the asset even if owned by a third party; this entirely transcends the personal obligation of
the loans!™,

Claimant does not dispute the fact that whenever there is a mortgage there is a loan (or any
other underlying obligation), or that a guarantee is intended to secure a principal transaction.
Whenever there is accessoriness, there are two assets: the principal and the accessory! , as
acknowledged by the Supreme Court and the Mexican legal authorities!*, And these
interests require separate treatment for purposes of Art. 1139 NAFTA!.

Second, Loans, Mortgages, and Notes do not have the same object, even if they refer to the
same debt. A mortgage creates different property rights and economic interests compared
to a loan. While loans have as their object a payment obligation, mortgages provide the
possibility for the creditor to be paid from the sale of the mortgaged asset!°®. But mortgages
provide the creditor with much more than just a different procedural avenue to claim the
underlying debt: mortgages create substantive rights that go beyond the right under a loan,
because they allow the creditor to use a specific asset to obtain payment with full priority,

regardless of the solvency of the debtor; they also limit the powers of the owner over the
asset and they grant the creditor power to protect the value of the asset!®’.

Therefore, mortgages are autonomous and confer separate economic value!*. In contrast
with the value of the loan, the economic value of the mortgage is unaffected by the debtor’s
solvency and will remain equal to the value of the asset, as a consequence of the preference
granted over the asset!”

. Third, while the debtor under a loan undertakes a “debt”, the owner of a mortgaged asset

(which can be different from the debtor) assumes a “liability” under the mortgage: if the
debtor breaches the guaranteed obligation, the owner will suffer the sale of the asset for the
benefit of the creditor. No duplication or unjust enrichment takes place!!”.

MORTGAGES AND NOTES ARE “INVESTMENTS” UNDER ARTS. 1139 (G) AND 1139(H)

The Mortgages and the Notes can be characterized as “investments” under Art. 1139
NAFTA, separately and independently from the Loans!''. The Mortgages squarely fall
within the categories “real estate or other property” provided by Art. 1139(g) NAFTA!!?
(A.). The Notes fall within the category of “commitment of capital” under Art. 1139(h)
NAFTA! (B.). Furthermore, Mexico’s proposed interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA is
mistaken (C.).

The Mortgages are “real estate” and “property”

NAFTA does not define the terms “real estate” or “property”. Therefore, and unless Mexico
shows that the NAFTA State parties intended to refer to an autonomous understanding of
the terms “real estate” and “property”, it is necessary to refer to municipal law where the
property is located!!4,

Under Mexican law

Consistent with the above, NAFTA State parties and authors, opine that it is appropriate to
look at the law of the host State (in this case, Mexico) for a determination of the definition

and scope of “real estate” and “property”!'>. Other international tribunals have seconded
this view by holding as follows!!*:

“In order to determine whether an investor/claimant holds property or assets capable of
constituting an investment it is necessary in the first place to refer to host State law.
Public international law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords certain
protections to property rights created according to municipal law”.

135. Under the Mexican civil codes that govern the Mortgages, all rights in rem are considered
“real estate” (“bienes inmuebles”)''’. Thus under Mexican law, mortgages are considered
“real estate”, which is a protected category of “asset” under Art. 1139(g) NAFTA!''®. The
Claimant notes that even Mexico and its expert have acknowledged so!!”.

136. Mexico’s NAFTA-based treaty practice shows that, with only one exception, mortgages are
not considered as “related property rights”, but interchangeably as either “other tangible or
intangible property”, “other rights in rem”, “autres droits réels” or “derechos reales”, “other
rights”, “other property rights” or “otros derechos de propiedad” or, as in NAFTA, as an

example of “tangible or intangible property”!”°.

137. Twelve out of the twenty-one investment treaties concluded by Mexico with an express
mention of mortgages as investments characterize them as “rights in rem”'?!. Other treaties
refer to “property rights” (“derechos de propiedad”)'” when referring to rights in rem such
as usufructs and mortgages!?*. Conversely, the expression “related property rights” is found

primarily in the treaties concluded by the United States and only in one of the Mexican
bilateral investment treaties: the Mexico-Singapore BIT!™4.

Under international law

138. The term “property” has a broad meaning under international law and includes rights in and
over a property, i.e., in rem rights!”°.

139. International tribunals that adopt an autonomous understanding of the term “property” have
explained that!?°:

“[p]roperty can be defined as those material things which can be possessed, as well as
any right which may be part of a person’s patrimony; that concept includes all movable
and immovable, corporal and incorporeal elements and any other intangible object
capable of having value”.

140. Hence, the term “property” used in investment treaties may be understood to refer to both
things and rights over such things. “Property” refers to a bundle of in rem rights'?’. In
contrast, Mexico seems to understand “property” as limited to the right of full ownership,
implying that the words “related property rights” cover rights over things other than full
ownership!?°.

141.

However, the ordinary meaning of “property” in the international arena encompasses or is
inherently associated with the “rights” over a property, which includes mortgages!??:

“Property” may be broadly defined under international law as an entitlement of a person
that is related to a thing. It consists of certain rights with regard to the thing that are
usually effective against all other persons, that is, in rem rights”.

142. Therefore, “property” cannot reasonably mean just the thing, nor its full ownership. Full
ownership of a thing is one such legal interest. There are other in rem legal interests,
including mortgages!*°.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

 

The term “property” in Art. 1139(g) NAFTA was used generically by the NAFTA Parties.
It operates as an umbrella, covering, in addition to real estate, “other property” (tangible or
intangible) recognized as such in the respective domestic laws of the NAFTA Parties,
which, in the case of Mexico, include mortgages'*!.

ae ok ok

It follows from the above that the lack of reference to mortgages or “related property rights”
in Art. 1139(g) NAFTA does not prevent the Mortgages from been characterized as “real
estate or other property” pursuant to the international usus loquendi of the term
“property”!*?. Under such usus loquendi, the term “property” consists of certain rights with
regard to a thing, including those arising from mortgages. The terms “‘biens”/“bienes” used
in the French and Spanish versions of the NAFTA are understood as expropriable and
appropriable movable and immovable elements, including rights in rem'*?. Further evidence
of the international usus loquendi can be found in the treaty practice of the NAFTA State
parties, especially those treaties with a definition of “investment” based on Art. 1139
NAFTA. An examination of such treaties shows that, as per Mexico’s own usus loquendi:

- mortgages are treated within the paragraph defining property as an investment; and

- mortgages are treated separately from loans!*.

The Notes are a valid investment

The Notes are interests of economic nature arising as a result of the commitment of capital
of Lion in Mexico and used for an economic activity; as such, they are also a protected
investment under Art. 1139(h) NAFTA.

The Notes are “interests”:

- under Mexican law (“titulos de crédito”) containing a person’s (subscriber)

unconditional promise to pay to another person (holder) a determined sum of
money!5,

- following Canada’s understanding of the ordinary meaning of “interests”!>°.

Furthermore, the destination of the commitment was clearly an “economic activity” in
Mexico: the disbursements made by Lion were intended and used to provide Mexican

companies with the funds for the acquisition of land in Mexico and working capital to
develop them!*’.

C. Mexico’s interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA is ill-conceived

148. First, Art. 1139(d) NAFTA only refers to loans. There is no reference to mortgages,
promissory notes or, more broadly, guarantees securing a loan!**, The ordinary meaning of
the term “loan” in Art. 1139 does not include mortgages, something different and separate
from a loan. A mortgage may not exist without an obligation, but an obligation (e.g., a loan)
can certainly exist without a mortgage!*?.

149. The term “loan” is used in three other provisions in Chapter 11 in addition to Art. 1139
NAFTA (ie., Arts. 1108, 1109 and 1110). Under these provisions, loans are treated as
separate and distinct from guarantees, and only as credits and monetary obligations'*°, And
it is used in seven provisions outside Chapter 11, only three being relevant and in two of
them (Arts. 1001(5)(a) and 1201(2)(d)) loans are listed as separate assets from their
guarantees!4!,

150. Similarly, there is no reference in paragraphs (g) and (h) to loans, nor is there any reference
to a duration requirement of any sort. The fact that paragraphs (g) and (h) are self-standing
is furthermore confirmed by the lack of cross-references to paragraph (d), in contrast to
other categories listed as investment in Art. 1139 NAFTA'*. The drafters of the NAFTA
carefully'* identified the paragraphs that were intertwined or connected!“4; and yet nothing
in paragraphs (g) and (h), or in any other paragraph of Art. 1139, indicates or implies that
the qualification of a real-estate interest or interests arising from the commitment of capital
as an investment is subordinated to other paragraphs of Art. 1139!45.

151.

Second, the definition of “investment” under Art. 1139 NAFTA is constituted by eight
paragraphs, based upon categories of property rights and economic interests, not business
activities'*°, But this does not mean that all the requirements, conditions, and exceptions
included in each one of these eight paragraphs must be cumulatively complied with, under
the pretext that the ordinary meaning of one those paragraphs shall be read in context. On

the contrary, the fact that a condition is included in one of the paragraphs, and not in the
general heading that precedes the paragraphs, suggests that the condition in question is
applicable to that paragraph and not to the others!4”.

Since the language of paragraphs (g) and (h) of Art. 1139 NAFTA does not contain any
reference to the three-year requirement found in other paragraphs of Art. 1139 NAFTA'S,
as Mexico itself has noted, “seria una interpretacion inadmisible dado que implicaria
aiadir una palabra al Parrafo ... que no se encuentra ahi”.

Third, Art. 1139 NAFTA is a definition by enumeration of the economic interests that can
be considered to be a covered investment. Only three out of these eight categories include
restrictions such as the three-year initial maturity duration for loans (paragraphs (c), (d) and
(f))'°. The three-year requirement is thus an exception and must be interpreted restrictively,
pursuant to the general principle exceptiones sunt strictae interpretationis'*'. This principle
entails that a requirement such as the three-year original maturity cannot be applied to any
other hypothesis except those to which the text of Article 1139 NAFTA expressly provides
it applies'®*. In fact, the only limitation concerning “real estate” or “property” under
paragraph (g) is that they shall be acquired or used for an “economic benefit or other
business purpose”.

Fourth, given that the Mortgages qualify as an investment under paragraph (g) and the Notes
under paragraph (h) of Art. 1139 NAFTA, such characterization must produce an effet
utile!

The effet utile doctrine is generally understood as follows'**:

“This rule is sometimes invoked as a principle — according to which the interpreter has
sometimes to presume that the authors of a treaty, by adopting the wording of a
disposition, meant to give it a certain meaning in order for this disposition to receive
an effective application”.

The doctrine is not intended to give guidance in determining whether the asset under
consideration is a loan, real estate or property or a commitment of capital. The doctrine
simply states that the rules governing any of those categories shall be given their full effect

conducted in bad faith or that it strips a provision of its useful meaning'**. In this case,
nothing prevents an accessory right to be separately qualified as an investment, even when

In conclusion, the Loans, the Mortgages, and the Notes fall within three different paragraphs
under Article 1139 NAFTA, and shall be characterized separately, as acknowledged by

The Tribunal will first provide a summary of the expert opinion submitted by Respondent
(1.) and then of the one produced by Claimant (2.).

THE IRRA OPINIONS

Respondent retained Lic. René Irra Ibarra to serve as expert on Mexican law in this
arbitration. He submitted two reports with his opinions!®°.

Lic. Irra testified at the Hearing and ratified the main arguments established in his reports.
In particular, he developed the following arguments!*!:

- Lic. Irra identified as his main disagreement with Claimant’s expert that in his view
there are not three different negotia; there is just one negotium, evidenced by three
legal acts, which are separate, because a mortgage is not a promissory note, and
neither of them is a loan; but the existence of three legal acts does not imply that they
are different negotia'.

- The Loans are the underlying transaction that gave rise to the other legal acts: the
Notes and the Mortgages; Lic. Irra acknowledged that under Mexican law each of the
three acts is regulated by a different set of laws; but he rejected that the differences in
regulation imply the existence of different negotia; the differences are mainly

procedural: loans, notes, and mortgages empower the lender to use distinct court
actions to enforce its rights'®*, without creating separate transactions!.

- Mortgages and notes require the existence of a loan that is being secured or
formalized'®; the borrower assumes a single obligation, to repay the money lent, plus
interest, and this is the only obligation that the creditor can enforce, either through the
loans, the notes or the mortgage!®.

THE ZAMORA OPINIONS

Claimant retained Lic. Rodrigo Zamora Etcharren to serve as expert on Mexican law in this
arbitration. He submitted three reports on the matter!®”.

Lic. Zamora testified at the hearing and ratified the main arguments from his reports, in
particular!®:

- There are essential differences between the Loans, the Mortgages, and the Notes,
which go beyond furnishing three procedural actions: there are three negotia that
confer different rights, include different parties, and create different procedural
actions!

- Each negotium is a commercial asset that confers its own set of rights: creditors have
different rights under a loan agreement, under a note and under a mortgage!”°.

- The three negotia give rise to different procedural actions, which may be brought
simultaneously; a creditor can claim under the note, under the mortgage or under the
loan; this does not mean, however, that a creditor can recover the principal of the loan
three times; the principal is owed only once, and Mexican procedural law provides for
mechanisms to avoid such result!”!.

VII. DISCUSSION

163. The Tribunal is called to decide a discrete question: whether non-negotiable promissory
notes formalizing, or mortgages securing short-term loans, can still qualify as NAFTA
protected investments under Arts. 1139(h) or 1139(g), even if the loans fail the three-year
maturity test under Art. 1139(d).

164. In their submissions, the Parties have not referred to any previous decision by any court or
tribunal deciding on this very question!”*. The Tribunal is also unable to rely on the opinion
of the United States of America or Canada: although both States were entitled to submit
their opinion under Art. 1128 NAFTA, both decided not make use of such right. Nor has
the NAFTA Commission approved any binding interpretation (under Art. 1131(2) NAFTA)
shedding light on the issue.

165. In absence of any guidance, the Tribunal must apply the governing law mandated by Art.
1131(1) NAFTA: the Tribunal

“shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement [i.e. the NAFTA]
and applicable rules of international law”.

166. Applying such governing law, the Tribunal will in due course dismiss Claimant’s
submission that the Notes qualify as protected investments (1.), while finding that the
Mortgages do indeed qualify as “intangible real estate” for the purposes of Art. 1139(g)
NAFTA (2.).

1. THE NOTES DO NOT QUALIFY AS INVESTMENTS

167. Claimant’s case is that the Notes qualify as protected investments under Art. 1139(h)
NAFTA:

“(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory
of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under

(i) contracts involving the presence of an investor’s property in the territory of the
Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or

' Claimant has only drawn the attention of the Tribunal to one international law precedent where mortgages were

protected as separate investments. Many Americans had mortgages on property taken by Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav
Claims Agreement of 1948 did not include any provision concerning mortgages. Notwithstanding the above, the
Commission allowed claims for mortgages on the ground that the taking of the encumbered property effectively took
from the mortgagee the right to foreclose. Moreover, under the laws of Yugoslavia, a real property mortgage was
considered as real property — see “Foreign Claim Settlement Commission of the United States”, Decisions and
Annotations; CLA-511, p. 62; the best known decision is Erna Lina Klein, CLA-69.

(ii) contracts where remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenues
or profits of an enterprise”.

In Claimant’s view, the Notes constitute “interests arising from commitment of capital”.
Lion submits that the concept of “interests”, as used in this provision, includes titles, and
the Notes qualify as titles. “Interests” also cover “cosas mercantiles”, and under Mexican
law the Notes are “cosas mercantiles” . Finally, the other requirements are also met: the
source of the Notes is Lion’s “commitment of capital” and the destination of the capital is
an “economic activity” in Mexico!”.

Mexico disagrees. In its submission, the requirements of Art. 1139(h) are not met. Lion
made no contribution of capital under the Notes — the only contribution of capital was made
under the Loans. Notes are simply instruments which evidence the existence of a debt

created by the Loans and facilitate collection of the amounts due!”*.

The Tribunal — without hesitation — sides with Respondent.

The Notes clearly do not constitute protected investments under Art. 1139(g) NAFTA. To
support its conclusion, the Tribunal will briefly explain the nature of promissory notes under
Mexican law (A.), and then will reason why promissory notes do not meet the requirements
under Art. 1139(h) (B.).

Promissory notes under Mexican law

The three Credit Agreements entered into between Lion as Lender, and Inmobiliaria Bains
and C&C Capital as Borrowers, required that each “Credit Drawdown will be documented
in a non-negotiable Note”!’>. Complying with this contractual obligation:

- on February 28, 2007 Inmobiliaria Bains issued the First Note, undertaking to pay to
Lion US$15 million, plus interest, with final maturity date September 30, 2009!”°.

- on June 14, 2007 C&C Capital issued the Second Note in favor of Lion for US$12.45
million (plus interest), with final maturity date September 30, 2009!77; and

- on September 26, 2007 C&C Capital issued the Third Note, again in favor of Lion,
for US$5,355,479 (plus interest), with final maturity as of September 30, 2009!”*.

All three Notes share several characteristics:

- The Notes are defined as “pagarés” subject to Mexican law;

- The Notes incorporate the issuer’s unconditional promise to pay Lion the stated
amount, plus ordinary and penalty interest;

- The Notes are expressly stated to be “no negociable[s]”;

- Payments are to be made in Lion’s designated U.S. bank account, in freely available
funds;

- The issuer submits to the jurisdiction of the Courts of Mexico’s Distrito Federal.

Under Mexican Law pagarés are a special category of titulos de crédito'”. And titulos de
crédito (also known as ftitulos valor) are defined by the Ley General de Titulos y
Operaciones de Crédito [“LGTOC”] as'*°:

“documentos necesarios para ejercitar el derecho literal que en ellos se consigna”.

The legal definition underlines the basic trait of a titulo de crédito: a document signed by
the issuer, which grants its holder the rights literally mentioned (“incorporados”, to use the
technical expression) in the document.

Pagarés are one of the basic sub-groups of titulos de crédito: documents that formalize the
issuer’s unconditional promise to pay to the holder a certain amount of money on a certain
due date!*'. To be legally considered as a pagaré, the document must necessarily include
the word “pagaré”.

Pagarés are issued to formalize an underlying monetary obligation. Normally, this
obligation arises from a contract (contrato subyacente) entered into between issuer of the
pagaré and its first holder. In the present case, the contratos subyacentes are the three Credit
Agreements signed between Lion and Inmobiliaria Bains/C&C Capital. Under these
contracts the borrowers owe certain amounts of principal and interest to Lion, and these
obligations are “incorporated” into the three Notes, issued by the borrowers, designating
Lion as beneficiary, and which the borrowers delivered to Lion.

The relationship between a pagaré and its contrato subyacente can be “abstracto” or
“cqusal?!®2:

(i) In the first case, the law, seeking to protect third parties that acquire pagarés in good
faith by endorsement, creates a separation between the underlying contract and the payment
obligation incorporated in the pagaré. If the initial holder of the note endorses the pagaré

' Mexican law uses the concept titulos de crédito. Other Spanish-speaking jurisdictions use the equivalent
expression fitulos valor.

issuer pay the stated amount on maturity, while the issuer is prohibited from invoking
“excepciones personales”, i.e. defenses arising from the contrato subyacente between the
issuer and the first holder'*?. A pagaré that has been endorsed and against which
excepciones personales are not admitted is said to be “abstract”.

(ii) In the second case, the link between contrato subyacente and pagaré is not severable:
the issuer may deny payment invoking the same defenses that could have been used to reject
payment under the contrato subyacente. Pagarés that have not been endorsed, and
especially pagarés which are stated to be no negociables (i.e., where endorsement is
prohibited) are always considered titulos de crédito causales'**.

Pagarés no negociables, as are the Notes issued in the present case, do not provide the
holder with an abstract right to collect. The right incorporated into the note is identical to
the right arising from the underlying contract. The main advantage conferred by a pagaré
no negociable is procedural: the holder can enforce the right against the issuer through an
accion ejecutiva, an expedited procedure that permits the preliminary attachment of the
issuer’s assets'*®.

Pagarés no negociables do not meet the requirements of Art. 1139(h)

Art. 1139 NAFTA offers a sophisticated and precise definition of protected investments:
the provision lists eight categories of “interests” which are considered as investments, and
two categories which are excluded!*®.

The eight categories of interests that qualify as investment are in its turn divided into two
groups:

The first group comprises paragraphs (a) through (f) plus sub-paragraph (h.ii) of Art. 1139.
These six categories of interests all relate to situations where the foreign investor owns or
finances “enterprises” located in the host state.

The situations where the foreign investor finances an enterprise in the host state are
developed in paragraphs (c) and (d) and in sub-paragraph (h.ii):

- Paragraphs (c) and (d) cover “debt securities” bought or “loans” granted by the foreign
investor, and specifically require that the financing, if granted to an enterprise which
is not affiliated to the investor, has a maturity of at least three years;

83 See Art. 8 LGTOC; Irra I, para. 15.
'S4 Trra I, para. 28.
'85 Zamora II, para. 134.

186

The provision gives the overarching concept of “interests” to the ten categories to which it refers — see last line of

the definition.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

Sub-paragraph (h.ii) adds a different type of financing: contracts where the investor
commits capital (or other resources), and the remuneration depends “substantially on
the production, revenues or profits of an enterprise”; provided that this requirement is
met, NAFTA does not additionally require a minimum three-year maturity.

186. The second group of protected investments are those defined in paragraph (g) and sub-
paragraph (h.i). These provisions cover two distinct situations:

Paragraph (g) refers to “real estate or other property, tangible or intangible”, acquired
or used by the foreign investor for economic benefit or for business purposes; while

Sub-paragraph (h.i) extends the concept of investments to contracts in which the
investor commits capital (or other resources) to economic activity in the host state,
“including turnkey or construction contracts or concessions”.

a. The Tribunal’s decision

187. The b

188. In the

asic facts of the case are not in dispute:

The lender of the financing was Lion, a Canadian company;

The Borrowers were two unaffiliated enterprises located in Mexico;
The maturity was less than three years;

The contract was formalized in three Credit Agreements;

The Borrowers’ repayment obligations were additionally formalized in three non-
negotiable pagarés;

The remuneration for the Loans and the pagarés was a fixed-interest rate, without any
link to the revenues or profits of the Borrowers.

Tribunal’s opinion, Lion’s interest deriving from these financings — be it the Credit

Agreements or the Notes — does not meet the requirements to be considered as a protected
investment under any of the categories defined in Art. 1139 NAFTA:

189. (i) Art. 1139(d) NAFTA!*”:

'87 Exh. C-20.

“(d) a loan to an enterprise
(i) where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor, or

(ii) where the original maturity of the loan is at least three years,

but does not include a loan, regardless of original maturity, to a state enterprise”.

190. The Credit Agreements do not meet the requirements under Art. 1139(d).

191. Whilst it is true that the Credit Agreements qualify as “loans” to an unaffiliated enterprise,
as Claimant itself acknowledges, the Loans by themselves cannot constitute protected
investments, because they do not pass the three-year maturity test required by Art.
1139(d)(ii).

(ii) Art. 1139(c) NAFTA!:
“(c) a debt security of an enterprise
(i) where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor, or
(ii) where the original maturity of the debt security is at least three years,

but does not include a debt security, regardless of original maturity, of a state
enterprise”.

193. The Notes fail to qualify as “debt security” under Art. 1139(c).

194. The Tribunal shares the Claimant’s opinion that pagarés no negociables do not fit within
the definition of “debt security” set forth in paragraph (c)!*?: debt securities are tradeable,
while endorsement of pagarés no negociables is prohibited by law.

195. Be that as it may, even if it were accepted that the pagarés no negociables can be considered
as “debt securities”, the Notes would not qualify: having been issued by an unaffiliated
enterprise, they must pass, but fail, the three-year-maturity threshold.

196. (iii) Art. 1139(h.i) and (h.ii) NAFTA!®:

“(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory
of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under

(i) contracts involving the presence of an investor’s property in the territory of the
Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or

(ii) contracts where remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenues
or profits of an enterprise”.

197. The Notes also fail to meet the requirements under sub-paragraphs (h.i) and (h.ii).

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

Sub-paragraph (h.i) only covers contracts involving “the presence of an investor’s property
in the territory” of the host state; and to clarify its meaning, the provision provides three
examples (turnkey contracts, construction contracts and concessions). This category bears
no relationship with the case under discussion: pagarés no negociables, where the
underlying contract is a loan, do not imply the presence of an investor’s property in the host
state, and have no relationship with turnkey contracts, construction contracts, and
concessions.

Sub-paragraph (h.ii) also fails to grant protection to the Notes. It refers to contracts where
the investor commits capital, provided that the remuneration depends substantially on the
production, revenues or profits of an enterprise located in the host state — a requirement
which the fixed-interest Notes do not satisfy.

b. Claimant’s counter-arguments

Claimant argues that the Notes are protected, by referring simply to the chapeau of
paragraph (h), and excluding any reference to the examples provided in sub-paragraphs (i)
and (ii). In Claimant’s submission, the Notes qualify as “interests arising from the
commitment of capital [...] to economic activity” and consequently are protected'*!.

The argument is unconvincing — as Mexico has correctly argued'*?.

In the present case, Lion formalized the commitment of capital contractually — by signing
the Credit Agreements. Additionally, Claimant requested and obtained pagarés no
negociables issued by the Borrowers. The delivery of this causal (i.e., non-abstract) titulo
de crédito, intrinsically bound to the Credit Agreement, does not change the nature or the
scope of the legal relationship between Lender and Borrowers: their legal relationship
continues to be governed by the Credit Agreements, and — for the purposes of Art. 1139
NAFTA - such legal relationship continues to be a “loan” subject to paragraph (d); a loan
which does not meet the three-year maturity test. Contrary to Claimant’s view, the delivery
of this titulo de crédito does not constitute a separate and severable commitment of capital.

Claimant puts the focus of its analysis on the chapeau of paragraph (h) and submits that any
“interests arising from the commitment of capital” are protected.

This is not so.

The chapeau cannot be read by itself. The NAFTA does not extend protection to any
“commitments of capital”, but only to those which exhibit certain features so as to give rise
to “interests”. These features are defined through two illustrative examples in sub-
paragraphs (h.i) and (h.ii). Both sub-paragraphs share a common feature: both refer to
“contracts”. Thus, it is safe to conclude that a minimum requirement of “commitments of

Decision on Jurisdiction

capital” protected by paragraph (h) is to be formalized as contracts. The pagarés no
negociables do not meet this test: they are titulos de crédito, not contracts.

There is a further argument.

The contracts that underlie the pagarés no negociables — short-term, fixed-interest loans —
do not share any traits with the contracts described in sub-paragraphs (h.i) and (h.ii), which
serve as illustrative examples of protected “commitments of capital”. Sub-paragraph (h.i)
covers construction contracts and concessions, and sub-paragraph (h.ii) contracts with
variable remuneration. The ordinary meaning of a term in a treaty must be read in its context,
as Art. 31.1 VCLT mandates. And in this case the context provided by sub-paragraphs (h.i)
and (h.ii) shows that “commitments of capital” to be protected under paragraph (h) must
show some additional, defining feature, which simple short-term fixed-interest loans lack.
Loans are specifically governed by Art. 1139(d) NAFTA — and only protected provided that
the requirements set forth in that provision are met.

THE MORTGAGES QUALIFY AS INVESTMENTS

Having concluded that the Credit Agreements and the Notes do not qualify as NAFTA
protected investments, the Tribunal must now address Claimant’s final argument: that the
Mortgages qualify as “intangible real estate or other property” acquired by Lion “for the
purpose of economic benefit” under paragraph (g) of Art. 1139.

Claimant maintains that under Mexican law mortgages are considered “real estate” and
under international law, as “other property”!”?.

Claimant does not dispute that mortgages are accessory transactions, which secure rights
deriving from the Loans, but considers that the three-year minimum maturity required by
paragraphs (c) and (d) is inapposite!**, because the Loans and the Mortgages are separate
negotia, with different objects, different parties, and separate legal regimes. Mortgages are
rights in rem, effective erga omnes, allow the creditor to follow the asset even if owned by
a third party, and the value of the mortgage differs from the value of the loan: it is unaffected
by the debtor’s solvency and will remain equal to the value of the asset!®°.

Mexico disagrees. It says that mortgages are accessory, and that the only economically
relevant transaction was the granting of three short-term loans that did not qualify as an
investment. Claimant did not invest in mortgages. The definition of “loans” in paragraph
(d) includes loans secured by mortgages. Since the Loans in the present case have a maturity
date of less than three years, they do not constitute an investment!”®.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

Mexico adds that the mortgage is a security right created over real property, and the real
estate is never delivered to nor owned by the creditor; the only right conferred by the
mortgage is a preferential right to get paid from the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged
property, and this does not amount to “real estate or other property” under paragraph (g)!°”.

Finally, Mexico argues that if the Mortgages are considered separately, that would allow
protection of any loans — regardless of their original maturity — by just adding a security.
This was not the intention of NAFTA signatories!”*.

The Tribunal will analyze the nature of mortgages under Mexican law (1.), and then will
reason why the Mortgages in the present case constitute protected investments under Art.
1139(g) NAFTA, without such protection extending to the Loans or the Notes (2.).

MORTGAGES UNDER MEXICAN LAW
Lion obtained three mortgages as a security for the Loans:

- On June 13, 2007 Bansi S.A., as trustee, and as per the instruction of C&C Capital, as
founder and beneficiary of the trust, granted in favor of Lion the Guadalajara
Mortgage 1, which encumbered certain properties of the Guadalajara Project, and
secured the principal and interest owed under the Second Loan!””;

- On September 26, 2007, Bansi S.A, again acting as trustee, as per the instruction of
C&C Capital, granted in favor of Lion the Guadalajara Mortgage 2, which
encumbered certain properties of the Guadalajara Project”®’, and secured the principal
and interest owed under the Third Loan;

- On April 2, 2008 Inmobiliaria Bains granted the Nayarit Mortgage over the Nayarit
Project, located in Bahia de Banderas, securing the three Loans, including principal
and interest?°!.

Under Mexican law, mortgages are regulated by the Civil Code of the states where the real
estate is located, regardless of the nature of the obligation which is being secured. In the
present case, the Guadalajara Mortgages 1 and 2 are subject to the Civil Code of Jalisco
[CC Jalisco”], and the Nayarit Mortgage to the Civil Code of Nayarit [“CC Nayarit” ?.

Mortgages are derechos reales

217. Arts. 2517 CC Jalisco and 2264 CC Nayarit define mortgages in similar terms?°?:

219.

220.

221.

“Articulo 2517.- Es contrato de hipoteca aquél por virtud del cual se constituye un
derecho real sobre bienes inmuebles o derechos reales que no se entreguen al
acreedor, para garantizar el cumplimiento de una obligacion y su grado de preferencia
en el pago”?"

“Articulo 2264.- La hipoteca es una garantia real constituida sobre bienes que no se
entregan al acreedor, y que da derecho a éste, en caso de incumplimiento de la
obligacién garantizada, a ser pagado con el valor de los bienes, en el grado de
preferencia establecido por la Ley”””’.

Mortgages are defined as derechos reales that encumber real estate (or other derechos
reales), affording the mortgagee the right, if the guaranteed obligation is breached, to be
paid with the price resulting from the sale in public auction of the asset. The encumbrance
follows the asset: if the mortgagor transfers the asset to a third party, the beneficiary’s rights
over the real estate remain unaffected”.

Mortgages do not imply that the mortgagee acquires the possession or ownership over the
asset. The mortgagee does not enjoy the full set of traditional rights granted to the owner of
real estate (ius utendi, ius fruendi, ius abutendi), but only a right of preference: if the secured
obligation is not paid, the mortgagee can force the sale of the asset, and the price obtained
is used to satisfy the secured obligation?’ — provided that the mortgage has been
documented in a notarial deed and registered in the Public Registry?”*.

As derechos reales de garantia, mortgages always secure an underlying obligation, where
the mortgagee is the creditor and the mortgagor, the debtor (or a third party willing to
provide a guarantee). Although mortgage and underlying obligation are separate negocios
juridicos, created by declarations of intent of different persons, and formalized in separate
documents, mortgages are said to be “accessory”. Accessoriness implies that payment or
voidness of the underlying obligation provokes the extinction of the mortgage — but not that
both legal relationships are identical?!”

The value of the mortgage and that of the underlying obligation also do not have to coincide,
neither at the time of creation or thereafter: the value of the main obligation fluctuates with

the solvency of the debtor, while the value of the mortgage depends on the worth of the
mortgaged real estate (and the legal preference granted to mortgages)*"!.

Mortgages are bienes inmuebles

The CCs of Jalisco and of Nayarit distinguish between “bienes inmuebles” and “bienes
muebles”.

Under Art. 799 CC Jalisco and Art. 738 CC Nayarit, the definition of “bienes inmuebles”
extends not only to tangible assets but also to certain intangible rights:

- Tangible real estate is labelled as “inmuebles por naturaleza”’, and is defined by the
fact that such assets “no pueden trasladarse de un lugar a otro”;

- But both CCs, following a long tradition, also extend the concept of bienes inmuebles
to certain intangible rights over real estate (the so-called “bienes inmuebles
intangibles o incorporales”).

Picking up on this tradition, Art. 799 XII CC Jalisco and Art. 738 XII CC Nayarit provide
that “/os derechos reales sobre inmuebles” are also to be considered as bienes inmuebles.
The derechos reales sobre inmuebles are certain defined categories of rights in rem,
including but not limited to mortgages”".

The necessary corollary is that, under the relevant municipal law, the Mortgages constitute
bienes inmuebles (and more specifically bienes inmuebles incorporales o intangibles).

MORTGAGES MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF ART. 1139(G)

Under Art. 1139(g) NAFTA, protected investments include (inter alia) “intangible real
estate”, provided that the investor uses the asset for “economic benefit or other business
purpose”.

Claimant says that the definition of “intangible real estate” must be established applying the
lex situs, in this case the CCs Jalisco and Nayarit, and that under such rules mortgages
indeed qualify as intangible real estate. Lion adds that the second requirement is also met:
the Mortgages were granted for economic benefit.

The Tribunal concurs. It will first explain its reasoning (A.), and then will analyze Mexico’s
counter-arguments (B.)

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

The Tribunal’s reasoning

Under Art. 1139(g) NAFTA an asset, to be considered as a protected investment, must meet
two requirements: it must constitute “intangible real estate” and it must be used for
economic benefit or other business purpose.

The Mortgages satisfy both requirements.

(i) NAFTA does not offer a definition of the term “intangible real estate” used in its Art.
1139(g). Absent such definition, to determine whether an investor holds “intangible real
estate”, it is necessary to refer to the law of the host state. As the tribunal stated in Emmis??:

“Public international law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords certain
protections to property rights created according to municipal law”.

The municipal law in this case are the legal systems of the Mexican states of Nayarit and
Jalisco, since the encumbered real estate is located in these jurisdictions and both legal
systems embrace the /ex /oci rei sitae principle:

“Articulo 14.- Los bienes inmuebles ubicados en el Estado y los bienes muebles que en
él se encuentren, se regiran por las disposiciones de este Codigo” *"*.

“Articulo 15.- La determinacion del derecho aplicable se hard conforme a las
siguientes reglas: .. .

V. Los bienes inmuebles ubicados en el Estado de Jalisco y los bienes muebles que en
él se encuentren, se regiran por las disposiciones de este Cédigo”*'*.

Applying the CCs of Nayarit and Jalisco, the Tribunal has already concluded that both civil
law systems explicitly and unequivocally include mortgages within the legal category of
derechos reales, which in their turn constitute bienes inmuebles, and more specifically
bienes inmuebles intangibles or intangible real estate.

The Mortgages thus constitute intangible real estate, and meet the first requirement under
Art. 1139(g) NAFTA.

There is a small discrepancy between the terminology used in the Civil Codes of Nayarit
and Jalisco, and the one used in the Spanish version of the NAFTA: while the Civil Codes
refer to bienes inmuebles, the Spanish version of the NAFTA refers to bienes raices. Both
expressions are synonyms in Spanish?!°. The same conclusion, that there is no difference
between bienes inmuebles and bienes raices, is reached by comparing the terminology used

in the three equally authentic texts of the Treaty”'’: the French text uses the expression
“biens immobiliers” as equivalent to “real estate” in English and “bienes raices” in Spanish.

(ii) The second requirement established by Art. 1139(g) is also met: Lion acquired the
Mortgages for economic benefit and with a business purpose. Lion is an investment
company, and the purpose of the Mortgages was to secure commercial loans, granted to two
Mexican enterprises, with the purpose of earning interest (and eventually to invest in certain
real estate projects situated in Mexico).

For these reasons, the Tribunal is satisfied that the ordinary meaning of “real estate or other
property, tangible or intangible” in Art. 1139(g) includes the Mortgages.

Consistent treaty practice

The conclusion that the Mortgages constitute protected investments is confirmed by
Mexico’s treaty practice. Investment treaties signed by Mexico frequently include derechos
reales as a category of protected investments, and refer to mortgages as specific derechos
reales which are contained within the scope of protection.

The treaty practice starts with Mexico’s proprietary Model of Investment Promotion and
Protection Agreement, which in its Art. 2 provides a list of investments, and specifically
extends protection to “any other right in rem, such as mortgages” ?!*:

“[...] immovable property, acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of
economic benefit or business purposes, as well as any other right in rem, such as
mortgages, liens, pledges, usufructs and similar rights”.

There are at least 22 BITs signed by Mexico, which follow the same structure, and confirm
that in Mexico’s understanding hipotecas (mortgages) fall within the category of bienes
inmuebles intangibles". The first was the BIT between Mexico and Spain, executed back
in 1995, whose Art. 1 (4) (e) extended protection to

“la propiedad de bienes muebles o inmuebles, asi como hipotecas, derechos de prenda,
usufructos u otra propiedad tangible o intangible [...] adquiridos para actividades
economicas u otros fines empresariales”.

The language of the Treaty shows that, in Mexico’s understanding, hipotecas form part of
the general category of “propiedad intangible” and, more specifically, of “propiedad
intangible de bienes inmuebles”.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

There are good reasons why mortgages should constitute a category of protected investment
of their own. Mortgages are also inextricably linked with the piece of real estate that they
burden. And the value of this right in rem can be affected by measures adopted by the host
state, targeted at such piece of real estate (e.g., expropriation) or specifically at the mortgage
(e.g., dilution of preference). The purpose of treaties, when they include mortgages among
the protected assets, is to extend the scope of protection to this type of situations.

Summing up: the Mortgages — i.e. the derechos reales de garantia — granted to Lion, meet
the two conditions required by Art. 1139(g) to qualify as investments protected by the
NAFTA.

Mexico’s counter-arguments considered
Mexico raises several counter-arguments.

First, Mexico says that Claimant did not invest in mortgages; the only economically relevant
transaction was the granting of three short-term Loans””’. The Mortgages in this case are
accessory to and form an integral part of the Loans, and the definition of “loans” in
paragraph (d) including loans secured by mortgages. Since the Loans have a maturity date
of less than three years, they do not constitute investments””!.

The Tribunal is not convinced.

Lion provided funds to Inmobiliaria Bains/C&C Capital, and in exchange obtained two sets
of rights:

- personal rights against the borrowers deriving from the Credit Agreements (and the
Notes), plus

- rights in rem (derechos reales) over certain real estate assets located in Jalisco and
Nayarit.

Art. 1139 NAFTA does not define “investment” as an abstract notion. It simply states that
“investment means” one of eight categories of assets or “interests”, each defined in a
separate paragraph, and each subject to specific requirements. The technique followed by
Art. 1139 has an important implication: to be considered as a protected investment, an asset
or interest must meet the requirements of one of the eight categories. If an investor holds
several interests, and all qualify under different paragraphs of Art. 1139, each interest will
be protected. And if some of these interests meet the requirements, and others do not, those
compliant will still enjoy protection: an investor cannot be denied protection for compliant
interests simply because he or she also holds non-compliant assets.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

In the present case, Lion holds three interests that fall into two categories:

- Credit Agreements and Notes: these interests are not protected, because the Notes do
not fall under paragraph (h) (as already explained) and under paragraph (d) loans to
unaffiliated borrowers require a minimum maturity of three years — a condition which
is not met;

- Mortgages: in accordance with municipal law, mortgages constitute “intangible real
estate”; under paragraph (g), “intangible real estate” is protected, provided that the
asset was acquired for economic benefit or business purposes — a requirement that
Lion does comply with.

Art. 1139 NAFTA does not provide that an investor holding distinct interests, some of which
individually qualify as a protected investment while others fail, should be denied protection,
simply because one or more assets fail the test. Consequently, the Tribunal sees no reason
to deny protection to the Mortgages under paragraph (g), simply because its Credit
Agreements and Notes fall short of the standards under paragraphs (d) and (h).

Mexico has tried to circumvent this conclusion, arguing that the Mortgages are ancillary
transactions, and that Loans and Mortgages must be considered as one and the same
transaction.

Contrary to Mexico’s submission, the Mortgages, albeit ancillary, are not and never were
integral parts of the Loans. Loans and Mortgages resulted from separate declarations of
consent, made by different persons, at different times, and in different documents:

- The Loans were formalized in the Credit Agreements, the contracts in which Lion
consented to lend and the Borrowers undertook to repay principal and interest; while

- The Mortgages were created thereafter, in three separate notarial deeds, in which the
mortgagors unilaterally consented to the encumbrance of their property as a security
for the Loans.

From an economics point of view, there is also no identity between Loans and Mortgages:
the value of the Loans is the dependent on the borrowers’ solvency and capacity to pay,
while the value of the Mortgages hinges on the price which the encumbered real estate will
attain in a public auction and on the legal preference afforded to the mortgagee.

Second, Mexico adds that a mortgage is a security right created in real property that is never
delivered to or owned by the creditor; the mortgage only confers a preferential right to the
proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property. Mexico concludes that mortgages are not
“real estate or other property” under paragraph (g)°””.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

The Tribunal concurs with Mexico that mortgages are indeed security rights in real estate,
and that possession of the asset does not pass to the mortgagee. But Mexico’s suggested
consequence is a non sequitur.

As the Tribunal has already explained, under municipal law mortgages are considered
derechos reales, which by law constitute bienes inmuebles intangibles, and Art. 1139(g)
expressly extends protection to this category of assets. The ordinary meaning of “intangible
real estate” in paragraph (g), which the Tribunal has established by applying Mexico’s own
municipal law, does not support, but rather contradicts, Mexico’s argument that mortgages
are to be excluded.

Finally, Mexico argues that if the Mortgages are considered separately, that would allow
protection of any loan (regardless of its maturity) by just adding a security —a result said to
be contrary to the intention of the NAFTA signatories”.

Mexico’s counter-argument is based on a misconception: the Respondent assumes that, if
the mortgage constitutes a protected investment, the protection is automatically extended to
the loan. This is not so.

Loan and mortgage constitute separate categories of interests, with separate sets of
requirements to become protected investments. This implies that in certain situations the
mortgage may constitute a protected investment, while the underlying loan will not. In those
cases, the Treaty protection afforded to the mortgage is not extended to the loan. The scope
of protection which the investor enjoys, will depend on the measures adopted by the host
state in breach of the Treaty. If such measures affect the mortgage or the encumbered real
estate asset, the investor will be entitled to invoke NAFTA protection. If the measures target
the loan, no such protection will be forthcoming. To provide a simple example: an investor
holding a mortgage, which secures an underlying loan that does not meet the three-year
maturity requirement, is protected against an improper expropriation of the real estate,
which destroys the value of the mortgage’*4 — but not for a measure which specifically
targets the transfer of funds deriving from loans”*>.

CONCLUSION

In its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Lion asked the Tribunal for the following relief?”°:

“140. For the reasons discussed above, the Claimant respectfully requests the Arbitral
Tribunal to issue a decision on jurisdiction rejecting Mexico’s Jurisdictional Objection
and declaring that the Mortgages and Notes are indeed investments under NAFTA
Article 1139; and, consequently that it has ratione materiae jurisdiction to adjudicate
the claims brought by the Claimant; thus ordering the proceedings to continue and the

Respondent to file the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial in the period remaining,
according with the Amended Timetable.”
261. Mexico ended its Reply on Jurisdiction with the following request?”’:
“152. La Demandada solicita al Tribunal desechar la reclamacién de conformidad
con el Articulo 45(2) de las Reglas de Arbitraje del Mecanismo Complementario del
CIADI sobre la base de que la Demandante no ha establecido haber hecho una
inversion en México conforme a la definicién del Articulo 1139 del TLCAN y, por lo
tanto, que este Tribunal carece de jurisdiccion ratione personae y ratione materiae”.

262. The Tribunal has come to the following conclusions:

- The Notes do not qualify as investments under Art. 1139 NAFTA, for the reasons
established in Section VII.1 above;

- The Mortgages do qualify as investments under Art. 1139(g) NAFTA and the
Tribunal has ratione materiae and ratione personae jurisdiction to adjudicate the
claims brought by Lion based on measures adopted by Mexico that affect the
Mortgages, for the reasons set forth in Section VII.2.

263. Inaccordance with section 16 and the latest version of the Amended Timetable (Annex A)
of the Procedural Order No. 1, as well as para. 13 of the Decision on Bifurcation, the suspension
of the proceedings is hereby lifted. Respondent still has 78 days from the date of the issue of this
Award to the Parties to file its Counter-Memorial in the period remaining””*.

264. The Tribunal will shortly convene the Parties to discuss the continued progression of the
arbitration.

265. The decision on costs is reserved.
