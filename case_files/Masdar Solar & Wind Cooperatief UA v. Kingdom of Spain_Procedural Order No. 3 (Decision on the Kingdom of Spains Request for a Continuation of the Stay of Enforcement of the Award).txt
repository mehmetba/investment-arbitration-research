PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

On March 28, 2019, Spain filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (“ICSID”) an Application for Annulment (the “Annulment Application”) of the
Award.

In that application, pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID
Arbitration Rule 54(1), Spain also requested the ICSID Secretary-General (the “Secretary-

General”) to stay provisionally the enforcement of the Award.”

On April 4, 2019, the Acting Secretary-General registered the Annulment Application, and
notified Masdar that the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed pursuant to

ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2).

On May 23, 2019, the Secretary-General notified the Parties of the constitution of the

Committee in accordance with Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee was

Fernando Piérola Castro, a national of Peru and Switzerland; and Ms. Carita Wallgren-
Lindholm, a national of Finland. The Chairman of the Administrative Council appointed
the three members. The Secretary-General also informed the Parties that the annulment

Arbitration Rules. They were also informed that Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu, Team

Leader/Legal Counsel, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.

7. By letter of May 28, 2019, the Committee, through its Secretary, informed the Parties that
it had “decided to extend pro tem the provisional stay of enforcement until it has heard
both Parties and has reached a decision on the continuation of the stay.” To address the

Request for Stay, the Committee established the following schedule:

On July 17, 2019, the European Union filed an Application for Leave to Intervene as a
Non-Disputing Party (the “NDP Application for Leave”). The Parties’ submitted their
comments on the NDP Application for Leave on July 29, 2019.

On August 6, 2019, based on the Parties’ comments during the first session, the Committee

issued Procedural Order No. 1.

On October 9, 2019, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that on that date
Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan had resigned from his position as President of the Committee in
accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 8(2) and 53. Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules
10(2) and 53, the Secretary-General deemed the proceeding suspended until the vacancy

was filled.

On November 11, 2019, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that Mr. Kap-You
(Kevin) Kim had accepted his appointment as President of the Committee.* The annulment

proceeding resumed from the point it had reached at the time the vacancy occurred.

By email of November 13, 2019, Spain asked the Committee whether it could specify the

deadlines for its next submissions.

On November 15, 2019, Masdar wrote to the Committee regarding the procedural
timetable, the Request for Stay, and a request for leave to introduce into the record in the
Annulment Proceeding the Decision on the Continuation of the Provisional Stay of
Enforcement of the Award rendered in Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.a.r.l. and
Energia Termosolar B.V. (formerly Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.a.r.l. and
Antin Energia Termosolar B.V.) v. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31) on
October 21, 2019 (the “Antin Decision”). On November 18, 2019, Spain commented on

By letter of November 20, 2019, the Committee through its Secretary invited the Parties to
seek an agreement by November 22, 2019, on the necessary adjustments to all pre-hearing
deadlines in the existing procedural calendar so as to preserve the hearing dates. Having
noted that both Parties would be willing to participate in a further hearing to address the
Request for Stay, the Committee further invited the Parties to hold the proposed hearing
by telephone on December 4, 2019.

On November 22, 2019, the Parties submitted an agreed procedural timetable to the

Committee.

On December 3, 2019, the Committee through its Secretary informed the Parties that it
adopted the Parties’ agreed revisions to the procedural timetable. The Committee also

circulated a list of questions for the Parties to address at the December 4 hearing.

On December 4, 2019, Spain requested that the Committee provide a Spanish translation

of the December 3 list of questions, invoking Section 11 of Procedural Order No. 1.

On the same day, the Committee held a conference call with the Parties during which the
Parties addressed (i) the Request for Stay, including the December 3 list of questions, (ii)
Masdar’s November 15, 2019 request for leave to submit the Antin Decision, and (iii) the
European Commission’s Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party.
Spain reiterated that the December 3 list of questions should have been sent in both English

and Spanish, as required by Section 11 of PO1°, a position with which Masdar disagreed.'°

On December 16, 2019, Spain submitted the electronic version of its Memorial in support
of the Annulment Application, along with lists of exhibits and legal authorities, and the
Expert Report of Professor Ricardo Gonsalbo Bono dated December 15, 2019. On January

By letter of December 17, 2019, the Committee through its Secretary recalled that the
Applicant had indicated in the December 4 conference call that it would like to request
leave to submit additional legal authorities. The Committee invited the Applicant to do so
by December 23, 2019, following which the Respondent (Masdar) would be afforded an
opportunity to comment on the Applicant’s (Spain’s) request. The Committee would then
issue its ruling on this request and Masdar’s November 15, 2019 request. The Committee
also invited Masdar to comment on the Applicant’s request at paragraphs 276 and 281 of

the Memorial in Support of Application for Annulment by December 23, 2019.

On the same date, the Committee through its Secretary circulated the Spanish version of

POI and the revised English version of PO1.

On December 19, 2019, Masdar submitted comments in response to the Committee’s
invitation to comment on the Applicant’s request at paragraphs 276 and 281 of the
Memorial in Support of Application for Annulment. On December 23, 2019, the
Committee through its Secretary invited Masdar to file its comments on the Applicant’s
request in its Counter-Memorial on Annulment, which was scheduled to be filed on April

1, 2020.

On the same date, Spain informed the Committee that it opposed Masdar’s request to
introduce the Antin Decision into the record and that it sought leave to introduce three

additional legal authorities. '' Further to the Committee’s invitation, Masdar submitted on

11 Ex, RL-168, Stadtwerke Miinchen GmbH, RWE Innogy GmbH, and others v. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No.

legal authorities and factual exhibits, the Committee, through its Secretary, invited the
Parties to confer and inform the Committee by January 14, 2020 whether they were able to

submitted electronically the Spanish version of the Memorial in support of the Annulment
Application, along with lists of exhibits and legal authorities, and the Expert Report of

2020.

Case 1:18-cv-02254-JEB Document 38-1 Filed 05/26/20 Page 14 of 48

35. On January 23, 2020, the Parties simultaneously submitted the following documents:

. Spain’s Observations regarding the New Legal Authorities dated January 23, 2020
(the “Spain January 23, 2020 Comments”);

. Masdar’s Comments on New Legal Authorities Submitted by the Parties in relation
to Spain’s Application for the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement, of the same

date (the “Masdar January 23, 2020 Comments”);
. The Consolidated Index of Masdar’s Legal Authorities; and
. The Consolidated Index of Masdar’s Factual Exhibits.

36. On January 27, 2020, Spain sought leave to file two additional legal authorities pursuant
to Section 15.6 of PO1. Further to the Committee’s invitation, Masdar submitted comments
on this request on February 3, 2020 and sought permission to file comments on certain
“misrepresentations” it identified in Spain’s January 23, 2020 Comments, following which

Spain indicated it had contacted Masdar to discuss the matter.

37. On February 12, 2020, Spain informed the Committee that, following consultations with
counsel for Masdar, a paragraph of its January 23, 2020 Comments was to be replaced with

anew text.!?

38. | On February 14, 2020, the Committee conveyed the following message to the Parties

through its Secretary:

The Committee recalls that Masdar had expressed concerns
regarding certain comments made in Spain’s January 23, 2020
submission. The Committee understands from Spain’s email of
February 12, 2020 that Masdar’s concerns have been addressed by
the changes proposed by Spain to its January 23, 2020 submission.
For the sake of good order, the Committee invites Masdar to confirm
that the Committee’s understanding is correct and that Masdar’s
request in paragraph 6 of its February 3, 2020 letter is now moot.

2 In this paragraph, Spain discussed the “Order of the Federal Court of Australia dated 25 October 2019 concerning
enforcement of the Antin Award.”

39.

40.

Case 1:18-cv-02254-JEB Document 38-1 Filed 05/26/20 Page 15 of 48

The Committee further understands that Spain’s January 27, 2020
request under Section 15.6 of Procedural Order No. 1 is still
pending. Unless otherwise advised by the Parties, the Committee
will take the matter under advisement and issue its decision on the
request in the coming days.

On February 15, 2020, Masdar confirmed that “it no longer pursue[d] the request in
paragraph 6 of its 3 February 2020 letter, as Masdar’s concern arose out of Spain’s
misrepresentation of the Australian Order, which, as Spain now concedes, lifted the stay
on enforcement of the Antin award in Australia.” Further to Spain’s request for leave to
respond to Masdar’s communication, the Committee invited Spain to submit its comments
on the understanding that (i) Spain’s response should be limited to addressing Masdar’s
characterization that Spain has purportedly conceded that the Australian Order lifted the
stay on enforcement, and (ii) there was no need for Spain to revisit earlier allegations of
misrepresentation or inaccuracy regarding the third paragraph on page 3 of Spain’s

comments of January 23, 2020. Spain submitted its comments on March 6, 2020.

On March 13, 2020, the Committee conveyed the following message to the Parties through

its Secretary:

The Committee refers to Spain’s request pursuant to Section 15.6 of
Procedural Order No. 1 dated January 27, 2020 (“Spain’s request for
leave”) and Masdar's February 3, 2020 comments on Spain’s request
for leave.

Spain requests leave to submit the Order of the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia in Novenergia II - Energy &
Environment (SCA) v. The Kingdom of Spain, Civil Action No. 18-
cv-01148, January 27, 2020, and the accompanying Memorandum
Opinion.

The Committee notes that the Parties do not agree that these
documents should be allowed to be submitted to the Committee. The
Committee further notes that Spain's request for leave is based on
the argument that the documents were recently published (27
January 2020) and contain principles to be followed by the
Committee and factual context indicating that no ICSID ad hoc
committee should deny the stay of enforcement of an award whose
enforcement is being stayed by domestic courts.

44,

Case 1:18-cv-02254-JEB Document 38-1 Filed 05/26/20 Page 16 of 48

In the Committee’s view, Spain’s written request has failed to
provide a reasoned explanation showing how the above-referred
circumstances qualify as “exceptional” and justify granting leave to
file the proposed documents, within the meaning of Section 15.6 of
Procedural Order No. 1. Therefore, Spain's request for leave is
dismissed.

The Committee finally refers to the Parties’ communications of

February 15 and March 6, 2020. The Parties are invited to continue

to work in the spirit of cooperation that has been conducive to the

efficient conduct of these proceedings to date.
By email dated May 9, 2020, the Committee clarified to the Parties that the list of questions
referred to above at paragraphs 23-25 fell within the ambit of correspondence of an
“administrative or procedural” nature within the meaning of Paragraph 1 1(2) of Procedural
Order No. 1. Thus, the list of questions was not required to be sent in both English and

Spanish.

Having carefully reviewed the Parties’ submissions, the Committee hereby issues this
Decision on the stay of enforcement of the Award, pursuant to Rule 54 of the ICSID

Arbitration Rules.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

The Parties’ main positions are summarized below. The arguments are further elaborated
in the relevant section of the Committee’s analysis in Section IV. The Committee has

considered all other arguments raised by the parties, even if not expressly addressed herein.

APPLICANT’S POSITION

Case 1:18-cv-02254-JEB Document 38-1 Filed 05/26/20 Page 17 of 48

Spain’s Request for a Stay is based on the following main grounds:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

Granting stays of enforcement is the prevailing practice in ICSID annulment
proceedings, and there are no circumstances in this case that would warrant a

departure from that standard practice. !°

Unless faced with an obviously frivolous or dilatory annulment application, the
Committee should grant a stay of enforcement. As Spain’s Annulment Application
is based on serious grounds, made in good faith, and not dilatory, the continuation

of the stay is “compelling.”

Ifthe stay of enforcement is continued, Masdar will not be prejudiced: any delay in
payment of the Award will be compensated by the accrual of interest. However, if
the stay is discontinued, Spain will incur additional burdens and expenses. Among
other things, Spain will incur expenses for the recovery of funds if the Award is
ultimately annulled.'’ Moreover, there is a risk that such a recovery might not even
happen as Masdar might transfer its interest in the Award to third parties or

distribute the funds to its shareholders. !*

While the risk of non-compliance may be a relevant circumstance to consider in the
context of whether the stay of enforcement is required, it is not determinative. '? In
this case, if the Award is not annulled, there is no risk that Spain will not have the
financial resources to comply with the Award, “if and when the time comes that
such payment may be appropriate.”?° In addition, Spain intends to honor its
international obligations, both under the ICSID Convention as well as the law of

the European Union (“EU law”).”!

(v)

Spain has the obligation to submit the Award to the European Commission (“EC”)
for a determination on whether it constitutes State Aid that is compatible with EU
law. If the stay is lifted and the Award is ultimately annulled, the EC’s review of
the Award (and related determination) would be unnecessary.”? Furthermore, if the
stay is lifted, Spain will be forced to face a conflict between its obligations under
the ICSID Convention and those under EU law.” Nonetheless, Spain has already

initiated the process for seeking authorization by notifying the Award to the EC.*+

Spain requested that the stay of enforcement be granted without requiring the submission

of any type of security.”>

MASDAR’S POSITION

Masdar requested the Committee to dismiss Spain’s Request for Stay in its entirety?°, based

on the following grounds:

(i)

(ii)

There is no basis in the ICSID Convention or ICSID Arbitration Rules for a
presumption in favor of the granting of a stay of enforcement.’ The fact that most
requests for a stay have been granted in the past is neither dispositive nor indicative
- each annulment committee has decided by considering the specific circumstances

of the case before it.?*

The merit of an annulment application is not a valid ground for staying
enforcement. First, the Committee cannot decide at such an early stage of the
proceedings whether the application is well founded, as this would raise due process

issues. Second, an application based on “serious” grounds is the least that could be

expected in an annulment proceeding. Compliance with such a minimum duty does

not result in the grant of a stay.°

(iii) | The fact that Masdar might not suffer harm if the stay is continued is not a
circumstance that requires a stay. *° In any case, if the stay is continued, Masdar
actually does face the risk of not being able to recover the compensation granted in
the Award in light of the increasing number of creditors of Spain as a result of

awards in other investor-State arbitrations.*!

(iv) _ The potential risk of Spain having to recoup payments from Masdar if the Award
is annulled is not a circumstance that justifies a stay. It is a natural consequence of
the ICSID enforcement regime.*If there were a risk that such recoupment would
not be possible, that may constitute a relevant circumstance that requires a stay.
However, Spain in this case has presented no evidence that such a risk exists.*? In
any event, Masdar is willing to provide a written undertaking that if the Award is
annulled, Masdar will repay Spain all proceeds obtained through the enforcement

of the Award.*4

(v) The absence of a risk of non-compliance by Spain if the Award is not annulled
cannot be a circumstance justifying the stay of enforcement.* In this case,
however, the risk of non-compliance is high. Spain’s ability to pay the Award
depends on authorization from the EC, and the outcome of that process cannot be
known.*° Furthermore, Spain’s behavior since the Award was issued confirms that

Spain does not intend to comply with the Award.*”

(vi) | The fact that Spain is obliged to seek authorization from the EC and that the
enforcement might give rise to an unnecessary burden for Spain and the EC cannot
bea relevant circumstance that requires a stay.**First, the EC is not a party to these
proceedings and therefore whether or not it faces a burden should have no bearing
on the Committee’s decision.*? Second, since Spain has now notified the Award to
the EC, denying the Request for Stay would not occasion any additional burden on
Spain.*° In any case, imposing a stay would not solve Spain’s problems, it would
only postpone them.*! The fact that Spain might face a conflict between its
obligations under the ICSID Convention and EU law is not a “circumstance” that
requires a stay, as it is not the Committee’s role to resolve legal issues faced by
Spain. In any event, the obligations in the ICSID Convention should prevail over

those in EU law. *

48. Alternatively, Masdar requested that, if the Committee were to accept Spain’s request, it
should condition the stay of enforcement on the provision of a security in one of the
following three forms: (i) the payment of the sum under the Award and interest accrued
into an escrow account; (ii) the posting of a bank guarantee; or (iii) a written undertaking
by Spain’s Secretary of State for Energy that the Award will be paid if the Annulment

Application is rejected.

49. Finally, Masdar also requested the Committee to “order the Applicant to bear all fees and

costs associated with the Request [for Stay].”**

Case 1:18-cv-02254-JEB Document 38-1 Filed 05/26/20 Page 21 of 48

THE COMMITTEE’S ANALYSIS

In this Section, the Committee sets out the relevant legal standard under the ICSID
Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and proceeds to consider the individual

circumstances specified by the Parties in their submissions.

LEGAL STANDARD

Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules govern
the stay of enforcement of an award. For the interpretation of treaty text, the Committee is
guided by the customary rules of interpretation of public international law, as reflected in
Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. (the “Vienna

Convention”) *
Article 52(5) provides as follows:

Section 5

Interpretation, Revision and Annulment of the Award

[..]
Article 52
[..]

(5) The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so
require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the

45 Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention state as follows:
Article 31, GENERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the
treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its
preamble and annexes:

(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of
the treaty;

(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted
by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

16

Case 1:18-cv-02254-JEB Document 38-1 Filed 05/26/20 Page 22 of 48

applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his
application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the
Committee rules on such request.

53. In turn, Rule 54 states as follows:

Rule 54
Stay of Enforcement of the Award

(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment
of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time
before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the
enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application
relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the
consideration of such a request.

(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award
contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-
General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both
parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal
or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule
within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it
decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.

(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph
(1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or
Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the
request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the
date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except
that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may
order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion
in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new

(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its
provisions;

(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding
its interpretation;

(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.

Article 32. SUPPLEMENTARY MEANS OF INTERPRETATION

Recourse may be had to suppl means of i ion, including the -y work of the treaty and the

circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to
determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:

(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

17

Case 1:18-cv-02254-JEB Document 38-1 Filed 05/26/20 Page 23 of 48

Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to
grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).

(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3)
shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its
modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after
the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of
presenting its observations.

(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the
stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or
termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date
on which he dispatches such notification.

54. Article 53 of the ICSID Convention provides that the parties to a dispute shall abide by and
comply with the terms of the award “except to the extent that enforcement shall have been
stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.” Article 52(5) is the relevant
provision that authorizes an annulment committee to stay the enforcement of an award
while its decision on annulment is pending. In this respect, the stay of enforcement may be

deemed as an exception to the general enforceability of ICSID awards.*°

55. Article 52(5) is based on the premise that the stay of enforcement is a temporary measure
that ends with the decision on the request for annulment. It provides that the committee

“may” grant a stay pending a decision on annulment. The committee is thus accorded a

46 See Ex. CL-0290, Quiborax S.A. and Non-Metallic Minerals S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia (ICSID Case No.
ARB/06/2), Decision on the Application to Terminate the Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award, February
21, 2017 (“Quiborax v. Bolivia”), § 37; Caratube v. Kazakhstan, §{| 68-69.

certain level of discretion*’: it “may” decide to grant a stay, but “may” also decide not to

do so according to the circumstances.**

56. A committee’s prerogative to stay enforcement is contingent upon the fulfilment of a

condition, i.e., “if [the Committee] considers that the circumstances so require.”

57. The standard to assess whether circumstances “require” a stay is not stated in Article 52(5)
or Rule 54. In the absence of a specific standard, the Committee is of the view that
considering whether the circumstances require a stay is ultimately a discretionary
assessment to be made by the Committee based on the facts, conditions and/or events of

the case.

58. Article 52(5) does not identify the types of circumstances that may require a stay.” In
practice, however, some circumstances have been regularly considered by other
Committees as factors either for the granting of a stay or for its discontinuance. For
instance, the question of whether the applicant faces the risk of non-recoupment of funds,
should the Award be enforced and later annulled, is a circumstance that has been
considered by various annulment committees in determining whether the granting of a stay
was required.* Conversely, the fact that there is some indication that an annulment

application was made without basis in the ICSID Convention or with a dilatory intent is a

47 Some committees have also held that the term “may” contained in Article 52(5) provides a range of discretion. See
for instance Ex. RL-0111, Victor Pey Casado and Fondation “Presidente Allende” v, Republic of Chile (ICSID Case
No. ARB/98/2), Decision on the Republic of Chile’s Application for a Stay of Enforcement of the Award, May 5,
2010 (“Victor Pey Casado v. Chile”), 425; Ex. RL-0116, Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine

is open-ended” (Border Timbers v. Zimbabwe, § 78).

circumstance that has been considered as a factor weighing in favor of the discontinuance

of a stay.*!

Before the Committee addresses the circumstances specified in these proceedings, there
are two legal questions in dispute between the Parties that the Committee needs to address

at this stage:

° first, whether there is a “presumption” in favor of granting a stay of enforcement;
and

e second, whether there is a specific burden of proof requirement imposed on either
party.

a. Does Article 52(5) contain a “presumption” in favor of granting a stay

One of the questions in dispute before the Committee is whether there is a general rule in
the ICSID Convention in favor of granting a stay of enforcement. According to Spain, “it
is the prevailing practice for ICSID ad hoc annulment committees to stay enforcement of
an award during the pendency of the annulment proceeding. Absent exceptional
circumstances that require a departure from this standard practice, such stays have been
considered the norm.”* In support of its argument, Spain observed that stay has been
granted in 39 out of 55 cases in which a stay was requested.** For Spain, “[tJhere are no
circumstances presented in this case that would warrant a departure from this standard

practice.”*4 Spain also submitted that the plain language of Article 52(5) and Rule 54(2)

Case 1:18-cv-02254-JEB Document 38-1 Filed 05/26/20 Page 26 of 48

does not support Masdar’s argument that stays could only be granted in “exceptional

circumstances.”* Finally, in its Reply, Spain formulated its argument as follows:

The well-established arbitral precedents show that stays of

enforcement during annulment proceedings are commonplace,

routinely granted upon request, and that the Committees have “wide

discretion” to grant the stay, taking into account the circumstances

presented in each case.*°
For Masdar, “[tJhere is [...] no textual support in the ICSID Convention or in the ICSID
Arbitration Rules for the notion that there is a presumption in favor of granting a request
for a continued stay. On the contrary, staying enforcement is an exceptional measure.”*”
According to Masdar, “[a] stay should be granted only where an ad hoc committee
considers that the circumstances render it necessary.”** The only guidance provided by
Article 52(5) and Rule 54(4) is that the circumstances at issue must “require” a stay; they

must be compelling.*?

Furthermore, Masdar noted that while practice may show that in the majority of cases stays
of enforcement were granted, the committees in each case considered the “specific
circumstances” of the case concerned. Therefore, the fact that the stay has been granted in
most of the cases is neither dispositive nor indicative.©° Masdar argued that the stay

mechanism is exceptional in nature.*!

In the Committee’s view, the language of Article 52(5) is neutral. It does not contain a
rule in favor of, or against, the granting of a stay of enforcement. The provision authorizes
the Committee to grant a stay only “if it considers that the circumstances so require.” If

this condition is not fulfilled, the Committee has no authority to grant a stay.

Case 1:18-cv-02254-JEB Document 38-1 Filed 05/26/20 Page 27 of 48

The Committee acknowledges that in practice, the stay of enforcement has been granted in
most cases in which it has been sought. It also notes that some committees have relied on
this frequency of granting stays to rule in favor of a stay in the case before them.
However, as stated in Libananco v. Turkey, such an approach “does not follow from the

ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules.”

In the Committee’s view, the decisions of other annulment committees are binding on the
parties to those proceedings, but are not binding on other committees or on the parties to
other disputes. Moreover, for the purpose of interpreting Article 52(5), these decisions do
not constitute “subsequent practice” within the meaning of Article 31(3)(b) of the Vienna
Convention.°* The Applicant also acknowledges that, for purposes of a discussion on the
relevance of the Antin Decision, “the sources of public international law are those
enumerated in the article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice [...] judicial
decisions are an ancillary mechanism to help to determine which the sources of

international law are.”°°

At the same time, the Committee does not find in Article 52(5) or in Rule 54 an indication
that the circumstances that require a stay must be “exceptional”; as noted in Burlington

Resources v. Ecuador, the nature of these circumstances is unspecified.”

While stays of enforcement may be considered an exception to the general enforceability
of ICSID awards, it does not follow that the relevant circumstances required to grant a stay

should also be exceptional.

The Committee therefore reads Article 52(5) as requiring it to conduct an unbiased and
neutral assessment of the circumstances specified in the submissions of the Parties, without

assuming a priori that a stay of enforcement should, or should not, be granted.

b. Which party bears the burden of proof

The second legal issue that arises in these proceedings is the question of whether Article

52(5) and Rule 54 establish a particular burden of proof on either party.

According to Masdar, “Spain has the burden to demonstrate that there are circumstances
requiring the continuation of the stay that it requests.”®* It further submitted that Rule 54(4)
of the ICSID Arbitration Rules supports this interpretation by establishing that the request
for a stay shall specify the relevant circumstances justifying the stay. It added that “ICSID
ad hoc committees have consistently held that the party requesting a stay bears the burden
of proving that there are circumstances justifying their request.”© Masdar invoked the
general principle of burden of proof, according to which the burden of proof lies on the
party asserting an affirmative claim or defense.” It claimed that “it is for Spain to prove
the circumstances required for the stay [...] [and o]nly if Masdar raises a positive defence

does it have a burden of proof, and it does so only with respect to that defence.””!

On the other hand, Spain stated that it “has presented the Committee with an array of
circumstances that justify stay of enforcement. Hence Spain’s burden of proof has been

”? Tt also noted that “ad hoc annulment committees have held that, rather than

met.
requiring a strict ‘burden of proof’ approach, it is the committee’s task to exercise its
discretionary power to evaluate all relevant circumstances in determining whether a stay
of enforcement is to be continued.””* In particular, Spain submitted that in view of the

circumstances presented by it, Masdar had to give proof that it would suffer a prejudice as

a result of the stay.”* According to Spain, the stay should be granted “unless it is going to

cause irreparable harm to the one who requests enforcement.””°

The Committee recalls that Rule 54(4) provides that the request for a stay “shall specify
the circumstances that require the stay, its modification or its termination.” The ordinary
meaning of the term to “specify” is “to name or state explicitly or in detail.””° However,
specifying, naming or stating explicitly certain circumstances does not need to go as far as
demonstrating or proving the existence of those circumstances. In the Committee’s view,
the act of naming a particular fact may satisfy the requirement of specifying a circumstance
while the act of demonstrating or proving a circumstance seems to require more than a
mere assertion. It requires the submission of evidence or of an adequate explanation. Rule
54(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules in the Committee’s view only requires the applicant

to specify the circumstances, not to prove them.””

That said, the Committee acknowledges that the general notion that the burden of proof
rests on the party that makes an affirmative assertion, whether as a claim or as a defense,

should apply in the present case as a starting point.

Therefore, it is the Committee’s view that where Spain seeks a stay on the basis that
circumstances exist that require a stay, the burden will be on Spain to prove the existence
of such circumstances. At the same time, where Masdar makes a positive assertion, such
as the assertion that Masdar will be harmed by the stay, the burden will be on Masdar to

prove that it will be so harmed.

The Committee notes that the fact that the stay mechanism is “exceptional” under the

or a qualified burden of proof.

CIRCUMSTANCES SPECIFIED IN FAVOR OF, AND AGAINST, STAY OF ENFORCEMENT

Rule 54(4) provides that, “[a] request [for stay] shall specify the circumstances that require

the stay or its modification or termination.”

In its Submission, Spain specified certain circumstances that in its view justify the

continuation of the present stay of enforcement:
(ji that the Annulment Application has been made in good faith”®;
(ii) that continuing the stay would not harm Masdar”; and

(iii) that Spain will abide by its international obligations (i.e. there is no risk of non-

compliance with the Award if it is not annulled).*°

In addition to these circumstances, Spain argued that if the Award is enforced and later

annulled:
(iv) Spain would face the risk of non-recoupment of the funds from Masdar*!; and

(v) Spain and the EC would suffer a real prejudice in terms of unnecessary procedural
activity and burdens, and Spain would face a conflict of obligations under the

ICSID Convention and EU law*?;

On the other hand, in its submissions, Masdar opposed the relevance of these factors as

 

“circumstances” that “require” a continued stay of enforcement. *? In rebutting the

argument that continuing the stay would not harm Masdar, Masdar alleged that if the stay
of enforcement is continued, Masdar faces the risk of never being able to recover the sums

under the Award.**

80. Asa result of these submissions, the consideration of whether the stay of enforcement is

required is based on the following circumstances:

 

Circumstance Raised by

 

1. The Annulment Application has been made in good faith, is | Spain

2. Continuation of the stay would not cause adverse | Spain

Case 1:18-cv-02254-JEB Document 38-1 Filed 05/26/20 Page 32 of 48

a. Annulment Application made in good faith, well grounded and not dilatory
[Circumstance 1]
Spain argued that, in light of the case law, a stay of enforcement should be granted unless
the Annulment Application is without legal basis or is dilatory in nature.** Spain stated that
its Annulment Application is based on serious grounds, was made in good faith, and is not
dilatory.*° Therefore, there are no circumstances to cause the Committee to depart from the
standard practice of staying enforcement.*’ Spain stated that, if the frivolousness of an
application may lead to the rejection of a request for a stay, “then the seriousness of the

annulment application must necessarily be considered.”**

While Spain does not ask the Committee to make its ultimate determination on the merits
of the Annulment Application, it noted that a cursory analysis of the Annulment
Application would show the good faith and seriousness of the grounds for annulment raised
by Spain. Hence “premature” enforcement of the Award would be “manifestly

imprudent.”*?

Spain also argued that, in the light of awards rendered in other investment arbitrations, the
Masdar Award is unfounded or not properly reasoned, so that the “prudence principle and
the balance of interests” require maintaining the stay of enforcement.* Spain referred
particularly to the awards rendered in BayWa v. Spain, Stadtwerke v. Spain, and RWE v.
Spain.°' While Spain’s argument does not refer directly to the grounds for annulment
raised in its Annulment Application, it relies on alleged deficiencies of the merits of the

Award in order to request that the stay be maintained.

Case 1:18-cv-02254-JEB Document 38-1 Filed 05/26/20 Page 33 of 48

Masdar argued that the merits of an annulment application are not a valid circumstance
requiring a stay unless the application is manifestly dilatory.” At this stage, it is not

claiming that Spain’s Annulment Application is dilatory.”

The fact that an annulment application is not “manifestly dilatory” is not a circumstance

requiring stay, since that is the least that can be expected from any annulment application.”

In any event, Masdar argues that Spain has submitted no evidence of the strength of the

grounds of its Annulment Application other than self-serving statements.°

The Committee notes that the assessment of the merits or “seriousness” of an annulment
application in the context of a request for a stay has been addressed in various cases. This
Committee agrees with the committees in MTD v. Chile and CMS v. Argentina, which
explained that, “unless there is some indication that the annulment application is brought
without any basis under the Convention, i.e., that it is dilatory, it is not for the Committee

to assess as a preliminary matter whether or not it is likely to succeed.”°°

In the case at hand, the Committee finds that there is no indication that Spain’s Annulment
Application was brought without any basis in the ICSID Convention and that it is dilatory.
Masdar also has not made that claim.*’ Therefore, in light of the approach taken by the
other committees cited above, the Committee finds no reason to conduct a preliminary

assessment of whether or not the Annulment Application is likely to succeed.

The Committee notes that recourse to annulment, including the entitlement to request a
stay of enforcement, is a legitimate right provided for in Article 52 of the ICSID
Convention. It is assumed that this right is exercised in good faith.** This implies that any

application for annulment should be based on grounds that are considered by the applicant,

Spain in this case, to be serious enough for the applicant to initiate the annulment process.
It also means that, absent any indication to the contrary, an application must be deemed to
have been submitted in good faith, without the intent of delaying the enforcement of the

Award.

The Committee now examines whether a presumption of good faith of an annulment
application could be considered a circumstance that requires the stay of enforcement of the
award. If this presumption were to be so considered, all requests for a stay should be
accepted automatically. The Committee notes that this argument in effect can be seen as
amounting to the same argument as that of the presumption in favor of a stay. As noted
above, however, Article 52(5) contemplates that the granting of a stay shall not be an
automatic process. The stay depends on the discretion of each annulment committee,
which, based on the case-specific circumstances, may or may not grant it. For this reason,
the Committee considers that a presumption of good faith of the annulment application
cannot be a sufficient ground for granting a stay. In other words, that presumption cannot

qualify as a circumstance that “requires” a stay within the meaning of Article 52(5).

In this conclusion, the Committee agrees with the statements of the committees in Total v.
Argentina and OI European Group v. Venezuela. As they stated, “the mere fact that the

application is not dilatory is not sufficient to grant the extension of the stay.”””

The Committee has also considered the legal authorities that Spain submitted on January
15, 2020 and its comments on these authorities. The comments challenge the reasoning of
the Masdar Award in the light of the awards and decisions rendered in BayWa v. Spain,
Stadtwerke v. Spain, and RWE vy. Spain.'® For the Committee, these comments are legal
arguments, consideration of which presupposes some assessment of the Award, which in
this proceeding can only be made through a preliminary assessment of the merits of the

Annulment Application. However, as reasoned above, it is not for the Committee to

conduct any preliminary assessment of this application unless there is some indication that
it was brought without any basis in the Convention. Thus, the Committee considers that
Spain’s comments on certain features of the Award, as evaluated in the light of other

awards, do not constitute a circumstance that requires a stay of enforcement.

b. No harm to Masdar if the stay of enforcement continues [Circumstance 2]

Spain argued that Masdar would face no harm if the stay of enforcement is continued. If
the Annulment Application is ultimately rejected, Masdar would be fully compensated by

the interest accrued on the amounts under the Award. !°!

Masdar argued that the absence of harm arising from a stay of enforcement is not a
circumstance “justifying a stay that is required by Spain.”!°? In its view, Masdar “has no
burden to prove that the stay should be lifted”; rather, the burden is on Spain to demonstrate
that the stay should remain in place.'° Furthermore, contrary to Spain’s argument, the fact
that the interest accruing under the Award will be paid is not a “circumstance” warranting
the continuation of a stay, as a number of annulment committees have previously

confirmed. !°*

The Committee starts its analysis by recalling that according to the ordinary meaning of
the terms of Article 52(5), the circumstances that require a stay refer to “the material,

”°105 that demand or make the

logical, or other environmental conditions of an act or event
stay necessary.!°° The Committee notes that the relevant question is then whether the
absence of harm to Masdar ,since interest is accruing under the Award, is a circumstance

that renders the stay necessary.

Based on its submissions, Masdar does not dispute the fact that, if the stay is continued,

the interest accrued under the Award would compensate the opportunity cost to Masdar of

Case 1:18-cv-02254-JEB Document 38-1 Filed 05/26/20 Page 36 of 48

the sums under the Award.!°’ The question that remains, however, is whether the absence

of such harm to Masdar is a circumstance that requires enforcement to be stayed.

Even if Masdar is suitably compensated for the opportunity cost of the awarded sums, that
would leave Masdar in the same position as it would have been had the stay not been
granted. This may show that the stay is less (or not at all) burdensome, but it does not speak
to whether the circumstances require a stay. Since it is the latter that needs to be satisfied
pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee is of the view that the

lack of harm to Masdar is not itself a circumstance that justifies a stay.

ce. Masdar’s risk of not being able to recover the damages granted in the Award

if the stay is continued [Circumstance 3]
In contesting Spain’s argument that a continuation of the stay would not harm Masdar,
Masdar submitted that delaying enforcement would actually give rise to a “real risk” that
Masdar “would never be able to recover the damages to which it is entitled.”!°* Masdar
argued that Spain is the State against whom the second largest number of investment-treaty

claims have been made!”

, and its liability resulting from arbitration awards “‘is likely to
increase significantly in the weeks and months ahead.”'!° Maintaining the stay “would
force Masdar into a queue of potentially around 40 creditors”, and every day of delay in
enforcement “will directly reduce the likelihood of Masdar being able to enforce the Award
altogether.”!''! Masdar states that the committee in OJ European Group B.V. v. Venezuela
had denied a stay of enforcement in similar circumstances. !!? Masdar notes that Spain has

failed to address the analogy with this case.''!> For Masdar, the only manner in which this

prejudice can be prevented is “by dismissing the Request [for a Stay] and lifting the stay,

or alternatively, by ordering Spain to provide adequate security.”!!4

In its Rejoinder, Masdar argued that Spain has shown that it does not intend to honor the
Award, and this adds to the alleged risk that Masdar may be unable to recover the

compensation it is owed under the Award.!'>

Masdar also submitted awards rendered in other investment arbitrations to show that
Spain’s liability to award-creditors is allegedly increasing, and that Masdar’s risk of being
relegated among them is already materializing.'!® Masdar referred particularly to the
awards rendered in Antin v. Spain, OperaFund v. Spain, InfraRed v. Spain, SolEs v. Spain
and Cube v. Spain.''7

For Spain, Masdar’s argument that there is a real risk of facing a queue of around 40
creditors should the stay be granted is pure speculation. Rather, Masdar should prove that
Masdar’s viability depends on the payment of the Award.!!® The stay cannot be lifted based

on only speculation of harm.!!°

With respect to the argument that Spain had shown no intent to honor the Award, Spain
noted that it has opposed enforcement based on justified grounds and in accordance with
its rights. This cannot be taken to indicate that Spain does not intend to comply with the

award, !2°

The Committee notes that Masdar has presented decisions rendered in other arbitrations
to show that Spain’s liability to award-creditors is increasing and that Masdar faces a real
risk of being relegated among those creditors. However, the Committee also considers that

the risk being referred to by Masdar would largely depend on whether Spain’s financial

capacity is insufficient to cover the liability that it may face under this and other possible
awards. Spain has submitted that it is “the fifth-largest economy in the European Union,
and it is ranked 13th among all countries in the world in terms of GDP [...] [and that] there
is no danger that Spain would not have the financial resources to pay the Award in this
case.” 7! Masdar has not disputed these facts. '?? The Committee finds no reason to

question Spain’s economic capacity to deal with this liability, including that of the Award.

With respect to Masdar’s argument that in similar circumstances, in OJ European Group
BV. v. Venezuela, the committee found that the growing list of payment orders against the
Applicant “[put] the Respondent on Annulment in a long line of creditors undertaking
efforts to collect award amounts against the Applicant”!”, the Committee has not been
presented with further details on the similarities between that case and this case. For
example, the Committee has no information on the level of liability or the financial capacity
of the debtor in that case. In any event, the Committee understands that such a case was

decided on the basis of its own circumstances.

Accordingly, the Committee considers that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that,
if the stay is continued, Masdar will face the risk of non-enforcement of the Award as a

result of an increase in the number of Spain’s creditors.

Regarding the claim by Masdar that being able to recover the amount in the Award will be
all the more unlikely because, according to Masdar, Spain has so far resisted attempts by
Masdar to enforce the award, Spain’s exercise of its rights pursuant to the ICSID
Convention and other relevant laws to seek annulment of the Award and stay its
enforcement do not by themselves, in the Committee’s view, amount to an intent to escape

any obligations that properly fall due.

Based on the foregoing, the Committee finds that Masdar has failed to demonstrate that it

will suffer prejudice if the enforcement of the Award continues to be stayed.

d. No risk of non-compliance with the Award considering Spain’s compliance
with its international obligations [Circumstance 4]
Spain also submitted that if the stay is continued and the Award is not annulled, there is
no risk of non-compliance with the Award by Spain.'?4+ Given its economic capacity as a
country, “there is no danger that Spain would not have the financial resources to pay the
Award in this case.” '?5 It added that “[t]here is also no history of non-compliance”: “Spain
takes its international commitments seriously, and it intends to honor them”, and that if the
Award is not annulled, “it will seek the authorization of the EC to pay the Award in
accordance with the decision of the ad hoc annulment Committee in this proceeding, and
it will pay Masdar promptly upon receiving such authorization.” !2° This commitment

should be considered sufficient and should weigh in favor of continuing the stay.!?’

Masdar argued that the absence of a risk of non-compliance is usually a rebuttal to the
argument that there is a risk of non-compliance by the debtor. However, in Masdar’s view,
it is not a circumstance that would itself lead to the conclusion that a stay of enforcement
is required. !78 Even if it were a relevant circumstance, the risk of non-compliance by Spain
is high. To comply, Spain needs to apply for clearance from the EC, and it cannot be known
what the outcome of that process will be.'? Furthermore, Spain’s reliance on EU law to
avoid the payment of the Award is not a valid defense: if EU law is considered to be
national law, it cannot take precedence over Spain’s international obligations; and if EU
law is considered international law, Spain’s obligations under the ICSID Convention would
still take precedence over its obligations under EU law because of the principle of lex
posterior.'*° Moreover, the EU law instrument under which Spain allegedly has no choice

but to seek authorization from the EC is not binding, and it is questionable whether the

Award confers any “state aid” at all for purposes of EU law.'*! Finally, Masdar argued that
the Applicant’s behavior in this dispute confirms that it does not intend to comply with the

Award. !*

The Committee understands that under certain circumstances, the absence of risk of non-
compliance with the Award (if not annulled) is a factor that might be relevant to
considering a stay of enforcement. The Committee, however, does not find this to be a
relevant factor in the present case. Spain’s commitment to comply with the Award (if not
annulled) does not put Masdar in any better a position than it would have been if the Award
were immediately enforced. Therefore, any likelihood that Spain will comply with the
Award can at best be relied upon only to argue that a potential stay will not have a negative
effect. But by itself, it cannot be a circumstance that requires or calls for a stay, because
the same outcome is achieved even if no stay is granted. Therefore, it is the Committee’s
view that the likelihood of compliance is not, in itself, a circumstance that “requires” a stay

pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention.

To address this issue, the Committee considers that it need not make a ruling on whether
the risk of non-compliance is indeed high, as Masdar claims. The Committee’s finding with

respect to the relevance of this factor makes such an assessment moot.

e. Risk of non-recoupment of funds [Circumstance 5]

Spain argued that if the stay is lifted and the Award is enforced before being ultimately
annulled, it would face the prospect of trying to recoup amounts improperly obtained by
Masdar through enforcement.'*? In contrast to how Masdar will be suitably compensated

by interest if the enforcement of the Award is stayed, Spain’s difficulties in recouping from

Masdar any amounts recovered by it and the loss of interest that Spain will face cannot be

cured.'*4

In Spain’s view, it does not make sense to adopt an approach that will risk passing money
back and forth between the parties in this manner. Accordingly, in no case in which
annulment was granted has there been a situation where previously recovered sums have
to be recouped after the annulment,.!'*> In any event, Spain’s entitlement to seek annulment
and a stay of enforcement is not subordinate to Masdar’s right to obtain the enforcement

of the award.'°

Furthermore, there is a risk that recovered amounts cannot even be recouped from Masdar
in the first place if Masdar transfers its interest in the Award or the amounts payable
thereunder to third parties or its shareholders.'*” In the hearing on the stay of enforcement
dated July 15, 2019, upon a question from the Committee, Spain added that “Masdar is a
sort of instrumentality of the United Arab Emirates, and the United Arab Emirates are
buying, selling, and changing their corporations and their equity shareholdings constantly.
You can go to their website of IPIC or Mubadala, and you will see the very substantive

changes taking place in the portfolio.” !**

Masdar noted that potentially incurring recoupment expenses is not a circumstance that
requires a stay of enforcement. In its view, any such expenses is a natural consequence of
the ICSID enforcement regime. '? Spain is a Party to the ICSID Convention, and is
therefore bound by all its obligations, including those relating to the voluntary compliance

with Awards. '4°

117. While the risk of being unable to recoup sums that were previously recovered under a
subsequently annulled award appears to be a relevant factor for deciding whether a stay
should be granted, Spain has presented no evidence showing the existence of such risk in

this case.'4! According to Masdar, Spain’s allegation just relies on speculation. !47

118. In any event, to address any doubt concerning the recoupment of funds, Masdar is willing

to provide a written undertaking to repay any amounts due to Spain.'*

119. The Committee notes that the ICSID enforcement regime contemplates the immediate
enforcement of an award following its issuance (Article 53 of the ICSID Convention) and
the possibility of a subsequent annulment (Article 52 of the same). Thus, any risk of
recouping amounts recovered under awards that are later annulled is a normal consequence
of the design and structure of the ICSID Convention. If such a risk constituted a
justification for granting a stay, stays would be granted almost automatically in all but the
rarest of annulment proceedings. That would be contrary to the discretionary and

exceptional nature of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention. '+

120. Accordingly, the Committee considers that the risk of having to recoup previously

recovered funds is not a factor in deciding whether the circumstances require a stay.

121. On the other hand the risk of being unable to recoup such sums because they have been
depleted or transferred can be a relevant factor to deciding a stay.'*5 However, the cases in
which a real risk of non-recoupment was found were cases in which “the risk of bankruptcy

was shown to be a legitimate concern.”!¥° In addition to the risk of insolvency, it has been

noted that the original creditor’s failure to comply regularly with payment obligations!*”
or to return voluntarily the sums of the award!** could also be considered as circumstances

indicating a risk of non-recoupment.

122. It seems that both Parties agree that the risk of non-recoupment of funds may be a relevant
circumstance in favor of the granting of a stay.'4? They disagree whether there is a real risk

of non-recoupment in the present case, if the Award was enforced but then annulled. !°°

123. In the Committee’s view, it seems that the risk of non-recoupment in this case is based on
general assumptions. Spain has referred to some potential scenarios. The Committee notes,
however, that the transfer of interest in an award, the distribution of proceeds to
shareholders or the transfer of shares of a company to third parties are possible scenarios
that may occur in all cases in which the proceeds of an award are obtained by an original

creditor.

124. The Committee has seen no arguments or evidence in this case that would render any of
the abovementioned scenarios more or less likely to occur. There is no objective evidence
on the record pointing to specific facts that would support the existence of a risk of non-
recoupment. Moreover, there is no evidence on the record showing that Masdar faces the

risk of bankruptcy or that it fails regularly to comply with its payment obligations. !*!

125. The Committee understands that concerns relating to non-recoupment have been addressed

in other cases through the provision of appropriate assurances by the enforcing party to

'S! The committee in Total v. Argentina took a similar approach, in the sense that there was nothing in the record
suggesting that the investor would refuse payment in the event the award was annulled, nor was there any persuasive
evidence that an attachment of assets of the investor might affect the company to such an extent as to prevent payment
to the State if the award was annulled (Total v. Argentina, 4 103).

return the proceeds if the award is annulled.'*? In this case, Masdar is willing to provide a
firm commitment to return any proceeds obtained through the enforcement of the Award,

including any interest accrued on those proceeds.

126. In the light of the circumstances noted above, the Committee considers that this
undertaking would be a sufficient assurance to address any concern relating to non-

recoupment if the Award is later annulled.

f. Spain’s compliance with EU law requirements and procedures
[Circumstance 6]

127. In its Reply, Spain submitted that there is a real prejudice that could be caused to Spain
and to third parties if the Award is enforced and ultimately annulled. The EC has to
undertake a review of the Award under EU law — i.e. to assess “whether the prospective
payment by Spain to Masdar has the potential to distort competition in the EU internal
market and affect trade between member states.” '°? This review would have been
unnecessary if the Award is ultimately annulled.'** If the Award is enforced and the EC
determines that it is illegal under EU law, both parties will incur expenses and burdens:
Spain would have to start recoupment proceedings against Masdar, and Masdar could start
proceedings to challenge the EC decision.'** In addition, it seems that Masdar will actively
seek the enforcement of the Award in foreign courts.'°° All these burdens and expenses

could be avoided by staying enforcement. '*’ Considerations of efficiency, judicial

economy, the burden on the Parties and the need to streamline the process of satisfying the

Award demonstrate that a stay of enforcement is prudent and fair. !°*

128. Spain also argued that if the award is enforced, Spain will be forced to face an international
law conflict between its ICSID obligations and EU law obligations. '*? As noted in its
Reply, “[rJequiring Spain to comply with the Award, pursuant to Article 53 of the ICSID
Convention, without authorization of the EC, would breach Articles 107 and 108 of the
TFEU. [the “Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union”].”!® Spain also noted that
it has notified the Award to the EC.'"

129. For Masdar, the situation does not constitute a circumstance that requires the stay to be

 

maintained.!© First, any burden that lifting the stay would occasion on the EC is irrelevant
as the EC is not a party to the dispute. '©* Second, as the Award has been notified to the EC
and the Parties will have to make submissions before the EC regardless, lifting the stay
would not result in any additional burden for Spain, Masdar or the EC.'™ The fact that
Spain could face conflicting legal obligations in paying the Award is not a circumstance
requiring a stay. It is not for the Committee to resolve these legal problems.'® In any event,
the stay would not resolve them, but would just postpone them. If the Award is not
annulled, Spain will in any event face the same consequences. !®° Third, Masdar does not
accept that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the ICSID Convention and EU law.
The ICSID Convention should prevail over EU law.!©’ Lastly, Masdar denied that Spain

was under an obligation of EU law to notify the Award to the EC for authorization. In its

view, the EC Decision on which Spain relied for the notification of the Award to the EC is

not binding. '°*

The Committee notes that pursuant to the language of Article 52(5), it is not precluded
from examining any type of circumstances that may “require” the stay of enforcement. The
Committee therefore does not exclude the possibility that, in making its decision, it could
take into consideration the potential prejudice that an immediate enforcement of the Award
could cause not only to the Parties, but also to non-disputing third parties to the dispute. In
this vein, the Committee does not exclude a priori the allegation that a relatively premature
enforcement of the Award could cause certain prejudice to a non-disputing party such as

the EC.

The Committee notes that the procedural hardships identified by Spain — the avoidance of
which would allegedly justify the stay of enforcement — relate to the submission of the
Award to the EC and the EC’s authorization process under its own regulations. It also notes
that Spain has submitted the Award to the EC and that the process before the EC is currently
underway. The Committee thus understands that the procedural activity and any associated
additional burden that Spain is concerned about will take place regardless, now that the
Award has been notified to the EC. Therefore, a stay would do nothing to prevent the
circumstance in question. Accordingly, the procedural hardships claimed by Spain seem
not to be circumstances that “require” the stay of enforcement of the Award within the

meaning of Article 52(5).

With respect to the alleged conflict of laws that Spain would face in view of its obligations
under the ICSID Convention and EU law, the Committee acknowledges that the concurrent
application of the attendant obligations may be avoided for now through the stay of
enforcement of the Award. However, given the explanations provided by Spain, there is no
indication that the circumstances underlying the alleged conflict of laws would change. In
fact, if the Award is not annulled, the alleged conflict between Spain’s international
obligations under the ICSID Convention and EU law would remain in place. In any case,

the Committee is unconvinced that the mere existence of constraints imposed by legal

regimes other than that of the ICSID Convention — whether national or international — may

be a valid “circumstance” that “requires” the stay of enforcement of the Award.

For the reasons stated above, the Committee considers that the procedural burdens and the
alleged conflict of laws between the ICSID Convention and EU law are not circumstances

that require the stay of enforcement within the meaning of Article 52(5).

CONCLUSION

The Committee considers that the circumstances invoked by Spain in these proceedings
are not circumstances that require a stay of enforcement within the meaning of Article

52(5).
The Committee considers that Masdar should provide the written undertaking referred to
in paragraphs 125-126 of this Decision.

REQUEST FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SECURITY IF THE STAY WAS
GRANTED

Based on the foregoing, the Committee does not see a need to examine Masdar’s request
for the establishment of a security in case the enforcement of the Award is stayed.
COSTS AND FEES

In its Response, Masdar requested the Committee to order the Applicant to bear all fees
and costs associated with the Request for Stay. ' The Committee reserves the

determination of these costs and fees to the final decision on the Annulment Application.
