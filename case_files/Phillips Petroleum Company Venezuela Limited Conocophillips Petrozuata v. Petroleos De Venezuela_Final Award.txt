B. SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FACTS

9. The present dispute arises from the Respondents’ alleged unlawful confiscation of the
the Claimants’ interests in two extra-heavy crude oil (‘EHCO”) joint ventures in
Venezuela: the Petrozuata Project? and the Hamaca Project? (together, the
“Projects”), and from the Respondents’ alleged breaches of their contractual
undertakings and guarantees in relation to these Projects.

10. | The below summary gives an overview of the present dispute. It does not include all
facts which may be of relevance, particularly as they emerged from the extensive
evidence gathered at the hearing. Where necessary, the relevant factual aspects will
be discussed in the context of the Tribunal’s analysis of the disputed issues.

11. To provide some historical context, the discovery of Venezuela’s oil reserves and
their extraction by foreign oil companies commenced in and around the 1920s. In light
of these developments, Venezuela enacted certain measures, such as the 1943
Hydrocarbons Law, with the alleged objective of providing investors with a stable
legal framework in order to incentivize investments.4 However, it appears that
although the EHCO reserves had been discovered by this point in time, they
“remained untapped, partly due to the expense and technological difficulty of
extracting, transporting, and processing the EHCO into a marketable commodity”.®

12. A policy shift from the late 1950s resulted in Venezuela gradually reverting the oil
assets to its own patrimony, until finally in 1975, Venezuela enacted the 1975
Nationalization Law. Pursuant to this law all existing oil concessions in favour of
foreign oil companies were cancelled and all activities related to the exploration,
exploitation, manufacturing, refining and marketing of oil were “reserved to the
State”.° The 1975 Nationalization Law also provided for the creation of Petrdleos de

2 Project underlying the Association Agreement between Maraven S.A. and Conoco Orinoco Inc., originally dated
10 November 1995, and modified 18 June 1997 (“Petrozuata AA”).

3 Project underlying the Association Agreement between Corpoguanipa, Arco Orinoco Development Inc. (ARCO),
CPH and Texaco Orinoco Resources Company (“Texaco”), dated 9 July 1997, as amended (“Hamaca AA”).

® Organic Law that Reserves to the State the Industry and the Trade of Hydrocarbons, Extraordinary Official
Gazette No. 1,769, published on 29 August 1975 (“1975 Nationalization Law’), C-7/R-278, Article 1 (“Due to
reasons of national convenience, activities related with explorations carried out in the national territory to find oil,
asphalt and other with itatic of oil fields, the ‘ing or refining, transportation by
special means and storage; with the trade at local and foreign level of substances exploited and refined, and with
works required in connection therewith, under the terms provided for herein, shall be reserved to the State. In
consequence, based upon the provisions provided for in this Article, the concessions granted by the National

22

Venezuela, S.A. (“PDVSA”), a new State-owned and controlled national oil company
which would be responsible for the development and management of all oil activities
going forward.” The only limited concession for private participation in the
hydrocarbons industry was made in Article 5 of the 1975 Nationalization Law. This
provision allowed for the participation of private entities in the oil industry through the
route of association agreements between PDVSA and its subsidiaries on the one
hand and the private entities on the other, provided the associations had received the
prior authorization of the Venezuelan Congress.’ PDVSA was thus responsible for the
exploration and development of the untapped EHCO reserves. However, it seems
that the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (“Government” or
“Venezuela”) and PDVSA were unsuccessful in fully exploiting these vast reserves,
presumably because they lacked the financial and technical resources to do so on
their own.

Thus, in the 1990s, in the face of declining oil production, Venezuela once again
invited the Claimants and other foreign oil companies to enter into joint ventures for
developing the EHCO reserves located in Venezuela’s Orinoco Oil Belt. Attracting
foreign investment to the Orinoco Oil Belt was not without its difficulties, particularly
because of the nationalization in 1975. Foreign investors had concerns about another
nationalization, expropriation or capricious State conduct more broadly, as well as the
magnitude of the technical and commercial risks posed by the Projects.°

In order to allay the foreign investors’ concerns, the different constituencies of the
Government, including the Ministry’®, provided investors with financial incentives to
make their investments more attractive commercially. These incentives included a
reduced income-tax rate and a reduced royalty, along with other legal protections
against Government measures that might harm the investments. This became known
as the “Oil Opening” (or “Apertura Petrolera’) in Venezuela. The legal basis of the

Apertura Petrolera was Article 5 of the 1975 Nationalization Law, as mentioned

above."

The Venezuelan Congress formed a Bicameral Commission’? to define the structure
and fiscal incentives for all foreign investment in the Orinoco Oil Belt. In 1993, the
Bicameral Commission issued a report making a number of recommendations for
attracting foreign investment to the Orinoco Oil Belt.1? In a nutshell, the 1993
Bicameral Commission PDVSA Report identified three elements necessary to induce
foreign private investment for the development of the Orinoco Oil Belt: (a) lower
taxes, and in particular exempting the Orinoco Oil Belt associations from the 67.7%
income tax rate that applied to PDVSA and instead applying the much lower
corporate income tax rate; (b) lower royalty rates for the early years of the
associations’ operations; and (c) foreign majority ownership of the associations.

Over the following years, the Venezuelan Congress implemented the
recommendations of the Bicameral Commission. The key fiscal measures enacted
and implemented by the Congress were as follows:

(i) Revision of the income tax law whereby the associations in the Orinoco Oil
Belt were subjected to a 34% corporate income tax rate that was applicable
generally to any other industry and commercial activity in Venezuela, as
opposed to the income tax rate of 67.66% that was otherwise applied to
companies engaged in the hydrocarbons industry.'4

(ii) | Revision of the royalty rates, whereby associations would now pay the
Government a reduced royalty of 1% from the commencement of commercial
production until the earlier of: (a) 9 years from such commencement; or (b)
the time when the project had accrued sales income three times in excess of
the total investment made in development of the project. Upon expiration of

™ Supra, § 12.

‘2 The full title of the Bicameral Commission was the “Bicameral Commission for the Study of the Strategic
Associations of PDVSA concerning the Projects Maraven-Conoco and Maraven-Total-Itochu-Marubeni for the
Exploitation and Upgrading of Extra-Heavy Petroleum of the Orinoco Oil Belt” (“Bicameral Commission”).

the 1% royalty holiday, royalties were to be paid at the generally applicable
rate of 16.66%.'5

17. Moreover, in accordance with the requirements of Article 5 of the 1975
Nationalization Law, the Venezuelan Congress also authorized the Petrozuata
Project'® and the Hamaca Project.!” The Congressional Authorizations stipulated the
conditions based on which the Parties would negotiate the terms of the association
agreements for the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects. Pertinently, these conditions
recognized that the Government would retain the power to enact measures in respect
of the Projects as it thought fit, and the Government's power in this regard would not
be limited in any manner. However, in order to safeguard the foreign investors’
interests, these conditions provided for indemnification by the concerned PDVSA
Subsidiary against such measures/actions adopted by the Government which had an
unjust and discriminatory effect on the Projects’ cash flows and for the submission of
all disputes arising out of the association agreements to arbitration."®

18. It was against this backdrop that the Parties negotiated the association agreements
for the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects. The Claimants assert that the aforesaid
fiscal incentives i.e., the income tax and royalty reductions, were instrumental in
inducing their investment and in enabling them to secure financing for the Projects.

19. On 10 November 1995, the Petrozuata Association Agreement (“Petrozuata AA”) was
concluded between PDVSA Petrdleo (a subsidiary of PDVSA) and CPZ, establishing
the corporate structure for the Petrozuata Project.'? On the same date, PDVSA
executed the Petrozuata Guaranty”? in favor of CPZ, essentially guaranteeing
observance of the obligations assumed by PDVSA Petrdleo in the Petrozuata AA.

20. In the Claimants’ words, the objective of the Petrozuata Project was:

‘5 Royalty Agreement of the Strategic Associations of the Orinoco Oil Belt between the Ministry of Energy and
Mines and PDVSA Petrdleo of 29 May 1998 (“Royalty Reduction Agreement”), C-67, Clause 5.

‘6 Petrozuata Congressional Authorization, R-10/C-25.

‘7 First Hamaca Cogressional Authorization, R-11/C-59. The Petrozuata Congressional Authorization and the First
Hamaca Congressional Authorization are jointly referred to as “the Congressional Authorizations”.

‘8 Petrozuata Congressional Authorization, C-25, Sixteenth Condition and Twenty Third Condition; First Hamaca
Congressional Authorization, C-59, Twenty First Condition and Twenty Second Condition.

‘9 The Claimants describe the Project structure as follows: “The Project was structured through an incorporated
joint venture, Petrozuata C.A., formed by CPZ and PDVSA Petréleo. CPZ owned 50.1 percent of Petrozuata C.A.
in the form of “Class B Shares,” and PDVSA Petrdleo owned the remaining 49.9 percent in the form of “Class A
Privileged Shares.” Each shareholder appointed two directors to the Board of Directors, PDVSA Petréleo
appointed the President of Petrozuata C.A., while the General Manager was appointed by CPZ” (Request, § 44).

[T]o produce, transport and upgrade extra-heavy crude oil, and to market and sell
the resulting syncrude as well as other by-products. Under a separate Offtake
Agreement between ConocoPhillips and Petrozuata C.A., the majority of the
syncrude produced and upgraded by the Petrozuata Project would be refined at
ConocoPhillips’s Lake Charles Refinery in Louisiana. Billions of dollars were
invested into the venture in Venezuela, including construction of upgrader facilities
and pipeline infrastructure beginning in 1997. In 1998, ConocoPhillips invested an
additional several hundred million dollars to modify its Lake Charles Refinery to
enable it to process the Petrozuata syncrude.”'

   

21. It seems that the start of the Petrozuata Project was very successful and full syncrude
production started in April 2001, thereby triggering the initiation of the 35-year
production life of the Petrozuata AA and commencing the nine-year period during
which the 1% royalty rate would apply under the Royalty Reduction Agreement.22

22. Similar to the Petrozuata Project, the Hamaca Association Agreement was concluded
on 9 July 1997 (“Hamaca AA”)*> between CPH and Corpoguanipa, in addition to two
other foreign investors.2 The Hamaca Guarantee was concluded on the same
date.2° The commercial production of syncrude from the Hamaca Project began 7
years later, in October 2004.

23. Pertinently, the final text of the Hamaca AA was also approved by the Venezuelan
Congress by way of another Congressional Authorization on 11 June 1997.76 Both the
Petrozuata AA and the Hamaca AA incorporated provisions which obligated the
concerned PDVSA Subsidiary to indemnify the concerned Claimant against any
“Discriminatory Actions” by the Government, as defined in the AAs.2’ In a nutshell,
these provisions stipulate that in the event a particular measure/action by the
Government is unjust and discriminatory (as these terms have been defined in the
AAs) and adversely affects the cash flows of the Project, the Claimants will be entitled
to receive compensation from the Respondents for the effects of such

measures/actions.

In December 1998, Hugo Chavez was elected President of Venezuela. As part of his
so-called “Bolivarian Revolution’, he immediately expressed his dislike for the
Apertura Petrolera. Therefore one of Chavez's main goals became the reform of the
oil industry and the securing of this resource for the benefit of Venezuela and its

people.

As a first step, in 2001 President Chavez enacted the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law which
made certain changes to the regime that had previously existed under the 1943
Hydrocarbons Law and the 1975 Nationalization Law.”° This law purportedly provided
the substratum on which several measures came to be passed in later years, all of
which altered the fiscal incentives that had been extended to the EHCO projects. At
the same time, it appears that the Chavez Administration also started taking steps to
increase their control over PDVSA.

Opposition to this and other proposed reforms lead to political strife, including a failed
coup d’état against President Chavez in April 2002 and a PDVSA strike in December
2002,29 which was brought to an end in February 2003 with the removal of over
18,000 PDVSA employees (about 1/3 of PDVSA’s workforce). Subsequently, in
2004, in an unprecedented move, President Chavez appointed Mr. Ramirez as the
President of PDVSA as well as the Minister of Energy and Mines.°°

The Government subsequently adopted a series of measures which culminated in the
nationalization of the Claimants’ investment in May 2007, following the passing of the

2007 Nationalization Decree a few months earlier. In particular:

(i) In October 2004, the Government abrogated the Royalty Reduction
Agreement, which resulted in an increase of the royalty rate applicable to the
Projects from 1% to 16.66% (“Royalty Measure”);3"

30 In order to achieve this dual appointment, the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of PDVSA were amended
by a Presidential Decree. See Partial Amendment of Decree No. 2184 of 10 December 2002, containing the By-
laws of Petréleos de Venezuela, S.A., Official Gazette No. 38,081, published on 7 December 2004, C-112, Article

In May 2006, the Government introduced a tax which had the effect of further
increasing the royalty rate applicable to the Projects to 33.33% (“Extraction
Tax”);32

In October 2006, the Government enacted a law, pursuant to which the
income tax rate for EHCO projects was increased from 34% to 50% (“2006
Income Tax Law’);33

In February 2007, the Government enacted a decree, which nullified the rights
of all existing associations and required their migration to empresas mixtas or
mixed enterprises which were at least 60% owned by PDVSA or any other
affiliate designated by PDVSA (“2007 Nationalization Decree”).54

In May 2007, in light of the Claimants’ inability to reach a consensus with the
Respondents on the migration of the Projects to mixed enterprises, the
Claimants were dispossessed of their full interest in the Projects pursuant to
the 2007 Nationalization Decree.

The Claimants consider that the aforesaid measures were a series of co-ordinated

steps formulated jointly by the Respondents and the Government with the express

objective of taking the Projects and burying the Apertura Petrolera, which was

described by President Chavez in a speech given in 2007 (“Chavez's 2007 speech”)

as “

‘nothing other than a great project for giving the country away, for giving away this

gigantic resource”.*5 The abovementioned qualified measures were in turn described

in Chavez's 2007 speech in the following terms:

[I]In 2004, within this process of progressive recovery of oil sovereignty, on 11
October 2004, we restored the amount of the royalty for the hydrocarbons in the
Belt, that is, to what they paid in other areas, 16.66%. [...] This was the first
measure that we took, in the Belt [...] This measure of taking the royalty from 1% to
16.66%, [...] meant, every year, an additional collection of US$1.9 billion, take note
so that we are adding this all up here, US$1.9 billion, which before, they were
taking away, not anymore, now that the Taxman has come. Step one.

Republic of Venezuela, 29 July 2007 (transcript available from Servicio TvPrensa) (“Chavez 2007 Speech”), C-

197.

28

Step two: on June 24 of the next year, 2005, we set the royalty at 30% on excess
production here in the Belt, because they were producing above what had been
established, so we said, well, 16.6 for the production established in the agreements,
in the old agreements. But since the new petroleum Law that we passed in 2001
established an oil Royalty not of 16.6 but 30%, which is a fair royalty, so then we
said, you pay me the excess at 30% according to the new Law. Well, do you know
how much this is equivalent to in royalty income, income in addition to the previous
income, the US$1.9 billion? Add it to the US$1.9 billion, an additional US$1.6
billion, every year. [...]

Step three: in May 2006, one year later, we imposed the extraction tax to take the
royalty and make it equal to thirty-three and one third percent, that is, 33.3%, to
equal the royalty, level it out for all of the oil projects in the country, that they would
pay so that we would do away with these differences, where one might pay 16.6,
others 30, no 33.3%. The extraction tax, this increased tax collection by an
additional $400 million a year. How much is that? $3.5 billion+ $400 million, $3.9
billion a year. [...]

Step four: October 2006, it was established[,] because this is something else, the
Income Tax, which is another tax on profits, on income, they paid tax on non-
petroleum income, although they were taking oil[,] they paid the tax that everybody
pays who works with rocks, who works with paper, the normal tax[,] when we know
that the Oil Income Tax is a special tax because oil yields a lot of income, even
more in the last few years with the recovery of oil prices. Well, we took the oil tax to
what [the] Law says, 50%, they were paying 34[,] [...] Do you know how much that
represented in additional annual revenues? US$1.1 billion more. How much are we
up to [now]? Five billion dollars from only four legislative measures. [...]

Well, we're up to five [billion], and, step five, on February 26, 2007, the
nationalization of these companies was established by Decree [5.200], in the
Orinoco [Oil] Belt, the old companies that were in the hands of the [multinational
companies], and PDVSA had an interest, but a minority interest, PDVSA, we have
recovered or have gone into these four companies, Petroanzoategui,
Petromonagas, Petropiar, and Petrocedefio, the former Sincor, Ameriven
[Hamaca], Petrozuata, and Cerro Negro, PDVSA held an average 40% of the stock,
we received the profits in proportion to or the profits in proportion to that 40%.
NowJ[,] we’ve gone from 40 to 78%, almost double, therefore, almost 80%, that
represents more income for the country. Collection of revenues by this measure
increased US$800 million a year in addition in the revenue collection, in total,
because of these five measures for recovering sovereignty, we've recovered public
revenues of US$5.8 billion. That's equivalent, at the current exchange rate, to
12.18 trillion bolivars.°°

29. According to the Claimants, these qualified measures attract, first of all, the
Respondents’ obligation to compensate them under the Discriminatory Action
provisions of the AAs; and, second and independently, the Respondents’ civil liability
under Venezuelan law for willful breach of the AAs, as a result of their active
participation in formulating and procuring the measures that resulted in the Claimants’
ultimate dispossession.°”

30. It is thus these qualified measures and in particular the nationalization of the

Claimants’ interests in the Projects that lies at the heart of the present dispute.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Initiation of the Arbitration, constitution of the Tribunal and the appointment of

the Secretary

On 10 October 2014, the Claimants submitted the Requests for Arbitration

(“Requests”) against the Respondents.
On 5 February 2015, the Respondents submitted their Answer (“Answer").

The co-arbitrators nominated by the Parties were confirmed on 6 February 2015 by
the Secretary General pursuant to Article 13(2) of the ICC Rules:

. Laurent Aynés, as co-arbitrator upon the Claimants’ joint nomination.
. Andrea Giardina, as co-arbitrator upon the Respondents’ joint nomination.

On 27 March 2015, pursuant to Article 13(2) of the ICC Rules, the Secretary General
confirmed Dr. Laurent Lévy as President of the Arbitral Tribunal upon the joint
nomination of the co-arbitrators.

On 1 April 2015, the President of the Tribunal confirmed to the Parties that the
Tribunal was duly constituted and issued some initial procedural directions in this
arbitration.

On 9 April 2015, the President of the Tribunal circulated for the Parties’ comments the
draft Terms of Reference (“ToR”) and a draft Procedural Order No.1 (“PO 1”). The
President further informed the Parties of the Tribunal’s intention to appoint Ms. Eva
Kalnina as the Secretary of the Tribunal and also indicated the scope of her duties in

this capacity.

In their respective communications of 14 and 17 April 2015, the Claimants and the
Respondents provided their observations on the draft ToR and PO1. They also
consented to the Tribunal’s proposal to appoint Ms. Eva Kalnina as the Secretary of
the Tribunal.

On 20 April 2015, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties of its proposal to
hold an in-person first procedural meeting on 12 June 2015 in New York, subject to
substitution by a telephone conference, if the outstanding issues did not justify the
expenses involved for an in-person meeting. The Parties confirmed their availability to
attend the meeting by their emails of 20 and 21 April 2015.

On 21 May 2015, the ICC Court extended the time limit for establishing the ToR until
31 July 2015 (Article 23(2)).

On 12 June 2015, the Tribunal and the Parties signed the ToR during the first
procedural meeting which took place in person in New York.

The Written phase

In the course of this arbitration, the Parties filed several written submissions as well
as exhibits, witness statements and expert reports. On its part, the Tribunal issued a
number of procedural rulings. Some of these submissions and rulings are

summarized below:

e On 10 October 2014, the Claimants submitted their Requests.

e On65 February 2015, the Respondents submitted their Answer.

e On 12 June 2015, an in-person case management conference was held in New
York (USA) during which the Parties and the Tribunal signed the ToR.

e On 15 June 2015, the Tribunal issued PO 1.

e On 17 July 2015, pursuant to the directions in PO 1, the Claimants filed the
Statement of Claim along with accompanying exhibits, witness statements, expert
reports and legal authorities (“SoC”).

e On 12 February 2016, pursuant to the directions in PO 1, the Respondents filed
their Statement of Defense, along with accompanying exhibits, witness
statements, expert reports and legal authorities (“SoD”).

e In their communications of 23 February 2016, pursuant to the directions of the
Tribunal, the Parties set out their respective positions regarding possible
bifurcation of the proceedings, prior to the case management conference (the
“CMC”) scheduled for 24 March 2016.

e Between 3 and 17 March 2016, parties exchanged their submissions/observations
regarding bifurcation and document production.

e On 24 March 2016, at 4 pm CET, the Tribunal and the Parties held the CMC to
discuss the outstanding issues pertaining to bifurcation and document production.
At the CMC, after considering the Parties’ submissions in that regard, the Tribunal

31

denied the Respondents’ request for bifurcation. The Tribunal also heard the
Parties’ submissions on document production, but reserved its decision on the
disputed issues.

On 8 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (“PO 2”), setting out
its decision on Parties’ request for production of documents.

On 4 May 2016, the Respondents complained of purported deficiencies in the
Claimants’ document production and requested the Tribunal to order the
Claimants to complete their production of documents. On 6 May 2016, the
Tribunal granted the Claimants time until 20 May 2016 to comment on the
Respondents’ allegations.

On 20 May 2016, the Claimants provided their reply to the Respondents’
application of 4 May 2016, denying that their document production had been
deficient in any respect and requesting that the Tribunal deny the Respondents’

request.

On 27 May 2016, the Tribunal issued certain directions regarding the
Respondents’ application of 4 May 2016.

On 27 May 2016, pursuant to PO 1, the Claimants filed their Reply and Defense
to Counterclaim, along with accompanying witness statements, expert reports,
exhibits and legal authorities (“Reply”).

May 2016, the Parties made additional submissions concerning document
production.

On 14 June 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to hold the
full merits hearing in Washington D.C. as opposed to New York. The Tribunal
accepted the Parties’ proposal.

On 1 July 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (“PO 3”), deciding the
Respondents’ application of 4 May 2016 concerning the Claimants’ document
production.

On 9 September 2016, the Respondents submitted their Rejoinder, along with
accompanying witness statements, expert reports, exhibits and legal authorities
(‘Rejoinder’).

32

42.

On 4 October 2016, following a pre-hearing telephone conference held on 3
October 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.4 (“PO 4”), which
contained its decision and instructions on various issues relevant to the upcoming
hearing in the matter.

On 7 October 2016, pursuant to the directions in PO 4, the Claimants submitted
certain additional exhibits on which they intended to rely at the hearing. On 13
October 2016, the Respondents objected to the production of two of the additional
documents, i.e. two presentations regarding the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects
prepared by the Respondents, which had been previously produced in the ICSID
proceedings. Accordingly, on 17 October 2016, the Claimants applied to the
Tribunal for leave to introduce these contested documents into the record.

On 1 November 2016, having gone through the Parties’ submissions on the
Claimants’ application, the Tribunal decided to allow the Claimants to introduce
the contested documents into the record.

On 2 November 2016, pursuant to PO 4 and the Tribunal’s correspondence of 1
November 2016, the Parties filed their additional exhibits.

On 23 November 2016, the Claimants sought the Tribunal’s permission to
introduce three additional exhibits, which had become publicly available only after
the previous deadline stipulated by the Tribunal. On 25 November 2016, the
Respondents objected to the Claimants request. On the first day of the evidentiary
hearing (“Hearing”) on 28 November 2016, the Tribunal allowed the Claimants to
refer to the new documents during the course of their opening submissions, but
otherwise reserved its decision on admitting these three documents into the
record.

52.

53.

On 20 March 2017, the Parties filed their respective PHBs (“C-PHB” and “R-PHB”
respectively).

On 17 April 2017, both Parties filed their respective Statements of Costs. On 27 April
2017, the Respondents submitted an updated/amended Statement of Costs and also
provided their responses to certain clarification sought by the Claimants. On 16 June
2017 and 28 June 2017, the Claimants filed an updated Statement of Costs.

In accordance with Article 36 of the ICC Rules, on 12 March 2015, the ICC Court had
fixed the advance on costs at USD 650,000. On 3 September 2015, the ICC Court
readjusted and increased the advance on costs to USD 1,350,000. On 8 September
2016, the ICC Court readjusted and increased the advance on costs to USD
2,060,000. On 11 May 2017, the ICC Court once again readjusted and increased the
advance on costs to USD 2,620,000. On 5 January 2018, pursuant to Prof. Giardina’s
request for such payment of 29 December 2017, the ICC Secretariat requested the
Parties to pay further advances of USD 290,710 (to be shared equally) towards the
“Mandatory Contribution to the Lawyers Fund” (“MCLF Advance”) payable to Prof.
Giardina. As discussed in more detail in Section V below, not all of the aforesaid
amounts have been paid by the Parties in equal shares. Finally, on 16 February
2018, the ICC Court increased the advance on costs from USD 2,620,000 to USD
3,150,000.

Further, in accordance with Article 30(1) of the ICC Rules, the time limit for rendering
the final award was 6 months from the date of the last signature of the ToR, namely,
at 12 December 2015. Since then, and in accordance with Article 30(2) of the ICC
Rules, the ICC Court extended this time limit as follows:

. At its session of 2 July 2015, to 28 February 2017 (the Secretariat's letter of 2
July 2015);

. At its session of 16 February 2017, to 30 June 2017 (the Secretariat's letter of
24 February 2017);

. At its session of 22 June 2017, to 31 January 2018 (the Secretariat's letter of
29 June 2017);

. At its session of 18 January 2018, to 30 March 2018 (the Secretariat's letter of
29 January 2018);

April 2018).

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND RELIEF REQUESTED

The Parties’ arguments in so far as they are relevant and necessary to resolve the
issues in dispute have been reproduced prior to the Tribunal’s analysis of each
disputed issue. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal emphasizes that it has not
provided a summary of each specific argument raised by the Parties in their
submissions, as it would be both repetitive and unnecessary. The Tribunal has
reproduced only what it views as the most important arguments for its decision. Even

if not explicitly reproduced, the Tribunal has considered all of the Parties’ arguments.
THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF
In the ToR, the Claimants summarized their position as follows:

Under the Association Agreements, the Claimants performed their part of the
bargain: their large investments of money, technology and know-how
succeeded in creating highly profitable joint ventures, which in 2007 still had
approximately 30 years to run. By contrast, once the Projects were constructed
and online as a result of the Claimants’ performance, Respondents in bad faith
breached their commitments in the Association Agreements and the
Guarantees. They worked with the Government systematically to dismantle the
financial, contractual, and legal protections of the Projects, resulting finally in the
expropriations of 2007. This arbitration is thus brought to recover the amounts
due to the Claimants arising from Respondents’ breaches of their obligations
under the AAs (including the duty of good faith and fair dealing), the
Guarantees, and Venezuelan law, and alternatively to determine the amounts
due to the Claimants under the indemnification formulae in the AAs.°°

The Claimants first submit that, as part of the Government's attempt to attract foreign
investment in the framework of the Apertura Petrolera, it sought to come up with a
number of incentives and protections, all of which were documented through different
instruments, including in the form of reductions to the applicable income tax and

royalty rates.99

They note that it was PDVSA that directly encouraged and coordinated with the
Government a “suite of fiscal incentives”*° to encourage CPZ and CPH to invest in the
Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects respectively. It was PDVSA’s efforts that ultimately
led to four critical elements of the Projects being adopted: (a) the income tax
reduction; (b) the royalty reduction; (c) contract protections; and (d) legislative
approval of the framework of conditions for the Projects.‘'

The Claimants also emphasize that, for example, the income tax reduction was
guaranteed by the framework of conditions approved by the Venezuelan Congress‘?
whilst the royalty reduction was granted by a formal Royalty Reduction Agreement
between the Ministry and PDVSA Petrdleo.** The same incentives and protections
were also embodied in the AAs executed between the Claimants and the PDVSA

Subsidiaries, which were also endorsed by the Venezuelan Congress.*4

The Claimants further point out that both AAs establish similar rights and obligations
for the contracting parties, one of the key contractual protections being the
commitment by the PDVSA Subsidiaries — guaranteed by PDVSA in independent
agreements accompanying each of the AAs — to indemnify the Claimants against
any “Discriminatory Action” as defined in the AAs.45 Thus, where there are adverse
effects on the Projects’ cash flows as specified in the AAs (namely, “Significant
Economic Damage” for the Petrozuata Project and “Material Adverse Effect” for the
Hamaca Project), the Claimants are entitled to indemnification according to the
formulae prescribed in each AA. The Claimants underline that such indemnification is
supplemental to any other recourse available to the Claimants.*¢

According to the Claimants, the Respondents were initially aligned with them at the
time of signing of the AAs and Guarantees and the Claimants expected that they
would work in good faith to promote the Claimants’ rights and interests in the
Associations. All this changed upon President Chavez's rise to power which brought
significant transformation to PDVSA and its affiliates and included a political upheaval

as well as a termination of 18,000 managers, engineers and other essential
employees of PDVSA in 2003. The Claimants explain that, as part of his Bolivarian
Revolution, President Chavez promised to remake a “new PDVSA,” and in 2004, Mr.
Rafael Ramirez was given the unprecedented role of simultaneously serving as both
Minister of Energy and President of PDVSA.‘” The “new PDVSA"” soon turned on the
Claimants and — in willful breach of their contractual and legal obligations — the
Respondents played an instrumental role in devising and implementing a series of
measures that first reduced the value of the Claimants’ interests in the Projects and

ultimately confiscated them altogether.*®

The Claimants argue that PDVSA and its subsidiaries are the direct beneficiaries of
the expropriation and have enjoyed billions of dollars in revenues from the full (in the
case of Petrozuata) and majority (in the case of Hamaca) interests in the Projects that
they illicitly obtained.*? The Claimants also emphasize that they are yet to receive any
compensation for the nationalization of their property from either the Government or
the Respondents.*%°

More specifically, the Claimants note that, as stated by President Chavez in his 2007
Speech,*" the “steps” by the Government and PDVSA that led to the dismantling of
the Apertura Petrolera and their interests in the Projects included the following

measures:

i. First, starting in October 2004, the Government, working in coordination with
the Respondents, implemented the Royalty Measure, which unilaterally
abrogated the Royalty Reduction Agreement and imposed instead a 16.66 %
royalty rate — a dramatic increase from the 1% royalty rate that had been
promised at the outset of the Projects. Then in May 2006, the Government,
again alongside the Respondents, introduced the Extraction Tax which had
the equivalent effect of further increasing the royalty rate to 33.33%.

ii. Second, effective 1 January 2007, the Government, with the support of the
Respondents, eliminated the income tax regime enacted to induce investment

in the EHCO projects, raising the applicable income tax rate from 34% to 50%
(the “Income Tax Increase”).

iii. Third and finally, in February 2007, despite having appropriated a substantial
amount of the value of the Claimants’ interests in the Projects through the
abovementioned qualified measures, the Government and the Respondents
proceeded with implementation of the ultimate step: seizing control of the
operations and assets of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects pursuant to the
2007 Nationalization Decree. The Claimants submit that, on 1 May 2007,
Respondents, with troops standing by, assumed control over the Projects’
operations and that subsequently the Government and Respondents
announced to the world that they had expropriated the Claimants’ interests in
the Projects.

As a direct result of these qualified measures, the Claimants claim to have lost the
entire value of their investment in the Projects.

The Claimants contend that the Respondents took these adverse actions in utter
disregard of their legal and contractual obligations to the Claimants under the AAs
and the Guarantees. In other words, they played a critical role in bringing about the
measures that stripped the Claimants of their rights under the AAs, and effectively
appropriated the Claimants’ interests in the Projects for themselves.

In the Claimants’ view, the Respondents’ conduct in “procuring and implementing” the
qualified measures constitutes a willful breach of their obligations under the AAs,
including the duty of good faith and fair dealing. In the alternative, the Claimants
argue that interference by the Respondents in the performance of the AAs constitutes
a hecho ilicito (or tortious interference) under Venezuelan law. In either case, the
Respondents must compensate the Claimants for all damages suffered as a result of
these breaches, based on the full value of the Claimants’ expropriated interests in the
Projects.5?

Separately, and in all events, the Claimants contend that the qualified measures give
rise to liability on the part of the Respondents under the Discriminatory Action
provisions of the AAs which impose an obligation upon the Respondents to
indemnify/compensate the Claimants for the effects of any unjust and discriminatory

52 C-PHB, §§ 287-290; SoC, § 15(c).
5° C-PHB, §§ 2(b), 12(b), 22-25.

42

67.

68.

measures adopted by the Government. The Claimants argue that the very purpose
of these provisions is to guarantee that they receive contractual indemnification
against losses caused by the actions of the Government in accordance with the
provisions set forth in the AAs. According to the Claimants, the Respondents are
effectively required to act as partial insurers of the Claimants’ damages incurred as a
result of the Discriminatory Actions.5> Further, as a guarantor for the PDVSA
Subsidiaries under the Guarantees, PDVSA is obliged to ensure payment of
compensation by the PDVSA Subsidiaries to the Claimants under the AAs and

Venezuelan law.

As to the amount of damages, the Claimants allege that under the contractual
formulae for Discriminatory Actions, the cumulative damages exceed many billions of
US Dollars. In relation to the Respondents’ contractual breaches or alternatively
hecho ilicito, the Claimants claim to have suffered damages in a significantly greater

amount.

The Claimants also note that, in response to the measures enacted by the
Government, they repeatedly communicated their complaints to the Respondents and
then pursued the only other practical remedy, ICSID arbitration, against Venezuela
for more than seven years. The Claimants underline that Venezuela is not a signatory
to the AAs or Guarantees, nor is it a named party to these ICC proceedings, whilst it
is the sole respondent in the ICSID Arbitration where its obligations arise under the
Dutch-Venezuelan bilateral investment treaty and international law.5° The Claimants
emphasize that as a result of a ruling in the ICSID Arbitration, these ICC proceedings
are the only practicable legal recourse for the Claimants’ injuries flowing from the
Royalty Measure, the Extraction Tax and the Income Tax Increase. In other words,
the DA provisions of the AAs provide the Claimants with a further remedy against the
actions of the Government, whereby they can seek compensation/indemnity from the
Respondents for the effects of DAs adopted by the Government. Relying on these
provisions, the Claimants present claims under the DA provisions on the basis of the
Income Tax Increase, the Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax as well as the
Expropriation — the latter also being a discriminatory measure adopted by the
Government against the Projects — alongside their other claims flowing from the
Respondents’ breach of their obligations under the AAs.

4 The Discriminatory Action provisions. The relevant provisions of both AAs concerning Discriminatory Actions
are set out infra, §§ 100-109.

55 C-PHB, §§ 13-15.
58 C-PHB, § 11(I)-(n).

43

69. Finally, the Claimants have clarified that they do not seek double recovery for the
damage suffered. To the extent that they (or related entities) are awarded damages
for the same injuries in the ICSID Arbitration and receive payment of such an award,
the Claimants affirm that the Respondents will receive an appropriate set-off from
their obligations arising from an award in these proceedings, and vice versa.5’ The
Claimants’ submissions on this issue are as follows:

Accordingly, any monetary reparation (after deduction of legal and expert costs
incurred in connection therewith) that the claimants in the ICSID Arbitration may
actually recover (i.e., awarded and paid by Venezuela) in that case before
recovery in this ICC proceeding will reduce Respondents’ liability in respect of
the claims asserted in this ICC proceeding (to the extent that such reparation is
based on the same actions by the Government and/or PDVSA). The converse
is true as well. If Claimants receive payment for damages or in connection with
this ICC proceeding and are later awarded monetary reparation in connection
with the ICSID Arbitration (to the extent that such damages are based on the
same actions by the Government and/or PDVSA), Claimants will reimburse
Respondents for the amount that Respondents have paid in this ICC
Arbitration, after deduction of Claimants’ legal and expert costs, to the extent
necessary to prevent double recovery.5®

70. In their Reply, the Claimants sought the following relief:

568. As a consequence of the foregoing, the Claimants respectfully request that the
Arbitral Tribunal render an Award:

(a) Declaring that PDVSA Petrdleo willfully breached its contractual obligations and
duty of good faith owed to CPZ under the Petrozuata Association Agreement,
and that PDVSA Petrdleo is liable fully to compensate CPZ accordingly, for
losses currently estimated to be US$7.02 billion;

(b) Declaring that Corpoguanipa willfully breached its contractual obligations and
duty of good faith owed to CPH under the Hamaca Association Agreement, and

B. THE RESPONDENTS’ POSITION AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF
72. In the ToR, the Respondents summarized the Claimants’ case as follows®®:

The claims asserted by the Claimants can be divided into two categories: (i) the
Claimants seek to hold Respondents responsible for the actions of the
Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the “Government” or
“Venezuela”) in increasing royalties and taxes and nationalizing their interests
in two oil projects in the Orinoco Oil Belt known as the “Petrozuata Project” and
the “Hamaca Project”; and (ii) if they cannot get what they want in the first
category, then the Claimants seek compensation for those governmental
actions under the indemnity provisions of the Association Agreements relating
to those projects, which were specifically designed to compensate the
Claimants for governmental acts affecting their interests in the projects.

73. As to the first category of claims, the Respondents observe that it seeks to hold them
liable for allegedly collaborating, participating or assisting in, or implementing, the
Royalty Measure, the Extraction Tax, the Income Tax Increase, and the 2007

5° TOR, § 35.

47

77.

Nationalization Decree. They argue that these claims are not only unsustainable as a
matter of law, but are also non-arbitrable and beyond the jurisdiction of this Tribunal,
particularly as the Venezuelan Congress never authorized arbitration of such claims,
whether against the parties to the Association Agreements or PDVSA as guarantor,

and the scope of the guarantees does not cover such claims.

They further submit that what makes the first category of claims — namely, the claims
pertaining to willful breach — “truly incomprehensible” is that all parties to the AAs
understood very well when they entered into the Projects that the Government may
take action adversely affecting the Projects, including fiscal measures and even
outright seizure of assets or expropriation. The Respondents emphasize that this
was the focal point of the negotiation for the Projects in the 1990s: while the investors
were seeking “full compensation” for any adverse governmental action and “fiscal
stability’, such requests were “flatly rejected” by the Government.*"

As to the second category of the Claimants’ claims, the Respondents argue that no
compensation is due for acts that do not fall within the definition of Discriminatory
Action, as the term is narrowly defined under the AAs. The Respondents point out
that according to the Claimants’ own characterization of the Royalty Measure and the
Extraction Tax as non-Discriminatory Actions, any compensation claim based on
those measures should be dismissed. Likewise, compensation should be excluded
for the Income Tax Increase, as this too is not a Discriminatory Action.®

Furthermore, the Respondents also argue that the Claimants have failed to meet the
notice requirements of the AAs®, as well as the requirement to exhaust legal and
administrative remedies.

Lastly, the Respondents also raise a counterclaim and request a declaration that
Corpoguanipa will have the option to purchase Phillips Venezuela’s interest in the
Hamaca Project in the event of any award of compensation to Phillips Venezuela. In
other words, the Respondents are seeking a declaration of the right to exercise the

buy-out option enshrined in Articles 14.4 and 14.5 of the Hamaca AA, which would
render moot the claims asserted with respect to that Project.®

78. In the Rejoinder and R-PHB, the Respondents provided the following summary of
their position and requested the following relief:

VII. Conclusion
A. First Category of Claims

618. As demonstrated in the Statement of Defense and herein, the first category of
claims should be dismissed for all of the following reasons: (i) any claim based
upon implementation of the concededly sovereign act of nationalization in
accordance with Decree-Law 5.200 is non-arbitrable under Venezuelan law and
beyond the jurisdiction of this Tribunal; (ii) the “express contractual obligations”
now invoked by the Claimants to support their willful breach claim provide no
basis for any claim of breach; (iii) the concept of good faith under the
Venezuelan Civil Code does not form the basis of any claim under the facts of
this case; (iv) compliance with law does not constitute actionable conduct, and
a claim for hecho ilicito in any event could not be asserted with a contract claim
under the circumstances of this case; (v) the Claimants cannot meet the
element of causation essential to any claim for damages for either willful breach
of contract or hecho ilicito; and (vi) the Claimants’ own conduct leaves no doubt
that not even they ever thought that Respondents breached any obligation to
the Claimants and precludes the assertion of the claims herein. Each of the
foregoing independently warrants dismissal of the first category of claims.

619. Although it should not be necessary to enter into a quantum analysis for the first
category of claims, that analysis would yield the conclusion that compensation
in any event would be no greater than the amount shown in the table in
paragraph 614 above.®

B. Second Category of Claims

620. The second category of claims should also be dismissed because they are
based on the Compensation Provisions and the Claimants have not complied
with the requirements for compensation expressly set forth in those provisions.
If such requirements were to be disregarded, the compensation calculation
under the Compensation Provisions for the maximum period prescribed in the
Petrozuata Association Agreement would be as set forth in the tables in
paragraphs 615 and 616 above’, depending upon whether the maximum
period is applied to both Projects or only to the Petrozuata Project. Finally, even
if the relevant period for both Projects were to be the entire period from June
26, 2007 to the end of the original terms of the Association Agreements,
compensation would not exceed [USD 470.6 million].

C. Counterclaim

® SoD, §§ 325-334; Rejoinder, §§ 364-371.

®6 For the referenced table, see Rejoinder, § 614, where the Respondents calculate the maximum compensation
due to the Claimants with respect to both Projects in the amount of USD 489 million (without interest).

87 For the referenced table, see Rejoinder, § 615, where the Respondents calculate the maximum compensation
due to the Claimants with respect to both Projects in the amount of USD 153.1 million (without interest).

621.

The Tribunal should grant the declaratory relief requested in the counterclaim,
namely, that Corpoguanipa will have the option to purchase all “rights, titles and
interests” of Phillips Venezuela relating to the Hamaca Project at the “Buy-Out
Price” defined in the Hamaca Association Agreement, in the event of any award
of compensation to Phillips Venezuela.

D. Costs

622.

Given (i) the extraordinary delay of the Claimants in bringing these claims after
never mentioning them for a decade, (ii) the claims’ total lack of merit, including
the fact that the Claimants themselves, despite all their bluster about royalty
and tax measures, assert no claims of the first category for those measures
and, with respect to the second category of claims, actually concede that the
first two measures do not constitute “Discriminatory Actions,” and (iii) the
Claimants’ strategy of grossly exaggerating virtually all elements of quantum,
while at the same time pretending to be “conservative,” all costs of this
Arbitration should be assessed against the Claimants (Footnotes omitted).®*

ANALYSIS

In this section the Tribunal will assess the Parties’ positions and submissions on
liability. The positions and arguments of each Party, insofar as they are necessary to
resolve the relevant liability issues in dispute, have been reproduced prior to the
Tribunal’s analysis of each issue. The Tribunal has not provided a summary of each
and every submission, argument or objection raised by the Parties. Instead, it has
reproduced only what it views as the most important arguments determinant for its
decision. However, even if not expressly reproduced, the Tribunal has of course

considered and carefully examined all of the Parties’ arguments.

PRELIMINARY MATTERS

Arbitration agreement

The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is based on the arbitration agreements contained in
the Petrozuata AA, Hamaca AA, the Petrozuata Guaranty and the Hamaca

Guarantee.

Article 13.16 of the Petrozuata AA provides as follows:

All disputes arising in connection with the present Agreement shall be finally
settled by arbitration under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce in accordance with the said Rules. Each
side will appoint one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so appointed will appoint
the third arbitrator. If the two arbitrators fail to appoint the third arbitrator within
30 days of their appointment, upon the written request by any Party, the
Chairman of the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce
will appoint such third arbitrator. The place of arbitration shall be New York,

8 These conclusions were confirmed by the Respondents in their PHB. See R-PHB, §§ 898-902.

50

New York, United States of America. The arbitrators shall apply the law of
Venezuela to any such controversy or claim. The language of the arbitration
shall be English. Any decision or award of the arbitral tribunal (which shall be in
writing and contain an explanation as to how it arrived at its decision and award)
shall be final and binding on the parties to the arbitration proceeding.

82. Section 4 of the Petrozuata Guaranty provides as follows:
Section 4. Governing Law and Arbitration.

This Guaranty shall be governed by the laws of Venezuela and by generally
accepted principles of international law to the extent that such principles do not
contradict such laws.

All disputes arising in connection with this Guaranty, or the breach, termination,
interpretation, enforceability or validity thereof, shall be finally settled by binding
arbitration in New York, New York, USA, under the Rules of Conciliation and
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by three (3) arbitrators
appointed in accordance with said Rules. This agreement to arbitrate and any
resulting award shall be enforceable in any court with competent jurisdiction.

In accordance with the requirement of the Venezuelan Congress in its approval
of the AA, this is a Guaranty in support of commercial activities (to be performed
by a mercantile enterprise created pursuant to a Strategic Association between
CONOCO and PDVSA’S affiliate MARAVEN) which in no way grants to
CONOCO recourse to the full faith and credit of the Republic of Venezuela.
Consistent with this principle, PDVSA agrees that it shall only raise or claim or
cause to be pleaded defenses available to it as a government owned
commercial entity under the applicable law as opposed to those as may be
available to the Republic of Venezuela (and its government) as a sovereign
state.

83. Article 17 of the Hamaca AA provides as follows:

ARTICLE XVII
GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION; SOVEREIGN RIGHTS

17.1. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the Republic of Venezuela.

17.2. Arbitration

(a) Any dispute arising out of, or relating in any way to this Agreement shall
be settled exclusively and finally by arbitration. The arbitration shall be
conducted and finally settled in accordance with the ICC Rules.

i. If there are only two (2) parties to a dispute, then each party shall
appoint one arbitrator within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the
commencement of the arbitration, and the two (2) arbitrators so
appointed shall appoint the third (3rd), and presiding, arbitrator within
thirty (30) days after the later of the two (2) arbitrators is appointed by
the parties. If the two (2) arbitrators so appointed cannot agree within
thirty (30) days of their appointment on a third (3rd) arbitrator to serve
as presiding arbitrator and such time is not extended, then the

51

(b)

presiding arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICA as quickly as
practicable.

If there are more than two (2) parties to a dispute, such parties shall
attempt to agree, within fifteen (15) days after delivery of notice of the
commencement of the arbitration to all of them, to divide themselves
into two (2) groups for purposes of appointing arbitrators. If they so
agree within such fifteen (15) day period, then each group shall within a
further thirty (30) days appoint one (1) arbitrator, and the two (2)
arbitrators so appointed shall appoint the third (3rd), and presiding,
arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the later of the two (2) arbitrators
is appointed by the two (2) groups. If the two (2) arbitrators so
appointed cannot agree within such thirty (30) day period on a third
(3rd) arbitrator to serve as presiding arbitrator and such time is not
extended, then the presiding arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICA as
quickly as practicable.

If there are more than two (2) parties to a dispute and they cannot
agree within the above-mentioned fifteen (15) day period as to how
they should be grouped for purposes of appointing arbitrators, then the
ICA shall attempt, as quickly as practicable, to group the parties into
two (2) groups based on the parties' common interests and common
positions. If the ICA determines such grouping, each group so
determined shall attempt to appoint one (1) arbitrator within thirty (30)
days after such determination. The two (2) arbitrators so appointed
shall appoint the third (3rd), and presiding arbitrator, within thirty (30)
days after their appointment. If either group fails to appoint an arbitrator
within such thirty (30) day period, such arbitrator shall be appointed by
the ICA as quickly as practicable. If the two (2) arbitrators so appointed
cannot agree within thirty (30) days after the later of the two (2)
arbitrators is appointed by or for the parties, on a third (3rd) arbitrator to
serve as presiding arbitrator and such time is not extended, then the
presiding arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICA as quickly as
practicable. In the event the ICA determines that it cannot in fairness
group the parties into two (2) groups based upon common interests and
positions, all three (3) arbitrators shall be appointed by the ICA as
quickly as practicable.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) disputes submitted to arbitration
pursuant to Section 7.4, 11.9 or 15.4 shall be resolved by a single (1)
arbitrator agreed by the parties to the dispute; provided that if such
parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator within sixty (60) days of the
submission of the claim to arbitrate (or, in the case of arbitration
pursuant to Section 7.4, within the period set out in Section 7.4(d)), the
arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICA, and (y) disputes submitted to
an expert pursuant to Section 9.3, 12.2 or 14.2(g) shall be resolved as
specified in Section 17.3. In the case of an arbitration pursuant to
Section 7.4, such arbitration shall be conducted on an expedited basis
and otherwise in conformity with the requirements of Section 7.4 and,
to the extent not inconsistent therewith, this Section 17.2.

No arbitrator shall have any financial interest, direct or indirect, in the

dispute or any financial dependence, direct or indirect, upon any of the parties
to the dispute. All arbitrators shall be impartial and shall abide by the
International Bar Association's Rules of Ethics for International Arbitrators. In an
arbitration panel composed of three (3) arbitrators, the presiding arbitrator shall
not be of the same nationality as the parties to the dispute. In the event of an
arbitration before a single arbitrator, the sole arbitrator may be of the same
nationality as a party to the dispute. All arbitrators shall be knowledgeable of

52

the international petroleum business. All arbitrators appointed pursuant to this
Agreement shall have the power to issue orders for interim measures.

(c) Unless otherwise agreed by all parties to the arbitration, all arbitration
proceedings under this Agreement shall be conducted in New York City, United
States of America. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in the
English language with appropriate arrangements for the translation of any
testimony and documents, with the costs of such arrangements to be shared
equally by the parties.

(d) Each Party agrees that it will provide discovery in any arbitration
proceedings involving alleged environmental damage. Each Party agrees to
produce documents related to any and all of its activities in the Project Area.
Such documents shall include, but shall not be limited to, contracts, books,
records, internal documents, notes and memoranda, of any and all kinds or
types, to the extent they relate to such activities. It shall not be objectionable
that documents are requested by general category. Each Party also agrees to
provide oral depositions of its employees, officers and directors, and to fully,
accurately and timely answer written interrogatories submitted to it. Each Party
further agrees to permit environmental audits of the Project Area and audits of
such Party's contracts, books, records, internal documents, notes and
memoranda, and interviews of such Party's employees, for the purpose of
determining compliance with applicable law and environmental damage in the
Project Area and the cause thereof. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power,
upon the application of any party, to make all appropriate orders for the
discovery described above. The Parties further agree to use their best efforts to
cause third parties that they grant the right to conduct activities in the Project
Area to produce documents and make available employees for the purpose of
determining environmental compliance and damage in the Project Area and the
cause thereof.

(e) The award, decision or determination of the arbitral tribunal, which shall
be reduced to writing with the reasons therefor set forth therein, shall be final
and binding upon the Parties. Recognition and enforcement of any award,
decision or determination rendered by the arbitral tribunal may be had in any
court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by law, any rights to
appeal from or to cause a review of any such award by any court or tribunal are
hereby waived by the Parties. In any proceedings in the courts of the United
States of America in respect of this agreement to arbitrate, the arbitration
proceedings or the arbitral award, decision or determination shall be governed
exclusively by the United States Arbitration Act to the exclusion of the law of
any state. The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement and any arbitral award,
decision or determination rendered under it are international in nature and that
the enforcement of this Agreement or any arbitral award, decision or
determination rendered pursuant hereto shall be governed by the 1958 United
Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral
Awards.

17.3. Expert Determinations

(a) Disputes submitted to an expert pursuant to Sections 9.3, 12.2 and
14.2(g) shall be resolved as specified in such Sections and, to the extent not
inconsistent therewith, as set out in this Section. If the Parties are unable to
agree upon the identity of the expert within ten (10) days after the date of a
letter from one party giving notice that it seeks an expert determination, then
the Parties hereby agree that the ICE shall appoint such an expert, and shall
administer such expert determination on an expedited basis through the ICC's
Rules for Expertise.

53

(b) Any expert appointed hereunder shall be a reputable individual
possessing expert qualifications and knowledge and experience in the subject
matter of the dispute sufficient to resolve the dispute competently. Such expert
shall also be impartial and independent of the Parties. Within three (3) Business
Days of receipt of notice from any Party requesting the ICE to appoint an
expert, the Parties may notify the ICE of the professional qualifications and
experience they believe are required of the expert to be appointed for the
resolution of the particular dispute in issue, provided, they are not inconsistent
with Sections 9.3, 12.2 or 14.2(g), as applicable.

(c) All Parties agree to cooperate fully in the expeditious conduct of such
expert determination and, subject to the provisions of Section 9.3(f), to provide
the expert with access to all facilities, books, records, documents, and
information as the expert may request in order to make such decision on a fully
informed basis in an expeditious manner. The expert shall endeavor to resolve
the dispute in question within thirty (30) days, and in any event no later than
sixty (60) days, after his appointment, taking into account the circumstances
requiring an expeditious resolution of the matter in dispute; provided that no
failure to make a decision within such period shall invalidate the expert's
determination. Upon the request of any Party, the expert shall hold an
expedited, one-day hearing with each Party having equal time to be heard. All
communications between the Parties and the expert shall be conducted in
writing with copies sent simultaneously and by the same means to all Parties. If
any meetings take place with the expert, such as during an inspection of
facilities or the explanation of any documents or records, then all Parties shall
receive reasonable advance notice and be entitled to attend.

(d) The costs and expenses of the expert shall be borne by the Parties in
proportion to their interests in the Project.

17.4. Pre-Judgment Attachment

Except as otherwise specified in Article XI, each Party agrees that it shall not,
and waives any right it might have to, seek to attach assets of any other Party
prior to issuance of a final arbitral decision pursuant to this Article XVII.

17.5. Consolidation; Joinder

If any Party or any party to any Related Agreement or any other Person who is
bound to this or another similar arbitration agreement in connection with the
Project or activities conducted in the Project Area initiates multiple arbitration
proceedings, the subject matters of which are related by common questions of
law or fact and which could result in conflicting awards or obligations, the
Parties hereby agree that all such proceedings may be consolidated into a
single arbitral proceeding at the request of any Party. Without prejudice to the
above, the Parties also agree that any guarantor of a Party's obligations under
this Agreement or any Related Agreement may be joined or consolidated into
any arbitration that results under this Agreement. The Parties agree that any
party to a Related Agreement may be joined as a party in any arbitration
proceeding.

If any party to a Related Agreement is joined in an arbitration hereunder, any
provisions of such Related Agreement regarding the disclosure of information
shall apply. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 17.2(a), in the event that
in any arbitration proceeding to which Corpoven Sub and Corpoven are both
parties, the interests and positions of Corpoven Sub and Corpoven are not the
same, the ICA shall appoint all arbitrators in the arbitration proceeding.

17.6. Costs

84.

The costs of the arbitration proceedings (other than costs of arrangements for
translations), including attorneys’ fees and costs, shall be borne in the manner
determined by the arbitral tribunal.

17.7. Waiver of immunity

The Parties agree that the activities contemplated by this Agreement and the
Related Agreements are commercial in nature. To the extent that any Party has.
or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court, or from
attachment in aid of execution or any other legal process (other than pre-
judgment attachment) in any action or proceeding in any manner arising out of
this Agreement or any Related Agreement with respect to itself or its assets,
such Party hereby irrevocably agrees not to invoke such immunity as a defense
and irrevocably waives such immunity.

17.8. Alternative Resolution of Disputes

In the event that any arbitration or award pursuant to an arbitration conducted
according to the provision of this Article XVII is found invalid or unenforceable in
Venezuela for any reason, the Parties agree, at the election of any Party, to
submit any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement to
binding arbitration before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes ("ICSID") in accordance with its arbitration rules as in effect at the time
of such dispute. The Parties agree that for purposes of ICSID arbitration, the
activities contemplated by this Agreement will constitute an investment. Should
ICSID be unwilling or unable to hear a dispute for any reason, the Parties shall
select an alternate arbitration forum to determine the dispute. Subject to the
requirements of any such forum, all other provisions of this Article XVII shall
remain in effect with respect to any such arbitration.

Article 13 of the Hamaca Guarantee provides as follows:

13. Any disputes resulting from or related to this Guarantee or its performance
will be resolved exclusively by arbitration and any arbitration ruling will be
binding. The arbitration will be governed and conducted in accordance with the
Mediation and Arbitration Rules of the International Arbitration Court
(hereinafter referred to as the "ICA") of the International Chamber of Commerce
(hereinafter referred to as the "ICC Rules"). The Guarantor will appoint one (1 )
arbitrator and the Foreign Parties (or if more than one Foreign Party is involved
in the dispute, collectively, the Foreign Parties) will appoint one (1) arbitrator,
and if the Guarantor or the Foreign Party (or the Foreign Parties collectively) fail
to appoint their arbitrators within a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of
the notice of the initiation of the arbitration process, the ICA will appoint an
arbitrator to represent the party in question.

The two (2) arbitrators thus appointed, either by the parties or in representation
of the parties, will appoint the third arbitrator, who will preside over the
arbitration court, with a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the
last of the two arbitrators is appointed by or in representation of the Guarantor
and the Foreign Party (or the Foreign Parties collectively). If the two (2)
arbitrators thus appointed are unable to reach an agreement regarding the
appointment of the third arbitrator to preside over the arbitration court within a
period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the last of the two
arbitrators is appointed by or in representation of the Guarantor or the Foreign
Party (or the Foreign Parties collectively), and if the deadline is not extended,
then the arbitrator who will preside of the arbitration court will be appointed by
the ICA as soon as possible.

55

No arbitrator may have any direct or indirect financial interest in the dispute, nor
may any arbitrator be a direct or indirect financial dependent of any of the
parties to the dispute. All arbitrators will be impartial and will be subject to the
Rules of Ethics for International Arbitrators issued by the International Bar
Association. The arbitrator presiding over the court may not be of the same
nationality as any of the parties to the dispute. All arbitrators must be
knowledgeable in matters related to the international petroleum sector. The
arbitration court established in the manner specified in this Guarantee will have
the authority to issue orders imposing interim relief measures.

All arbitration procedures described in this Guarantee will be conducted in the
city of New York, United States of America, unless all parties to the arbitration
agree otherwise. The arbitration procedures will be conducted in English, with
the corresponding arrangements for translation of any testimony and
documents, and the cost of these arrangements will be shared equally by the
parties to the arbitration.

The ruling, decision or determination of the arbitration court, which must be in
writing and must be based on the corresponding facts and legal principles, will
be final and binding for the Guarantor and each of the Foreign Parties.
Recognition and enforcement of any ruling, decision or determination issued by
the arbitration court may be obtained from any court or tribunal having
jurisdiction. To the extent allowed by law, the Guarantor and each of the
Foreign Parties hereby waive any right of appeal or review of any arbitration
ruling by any court or tribunal. Any process before the courts of the United
States of America related to the arbitration commitment, the arbitration process
or the arbitration ruling, decision or determination will be exclusively subject to
the Arbitration Law of the United States of America to the exclusion of any law
of any State of the United States of America. The Guarantor and each of the
Foreign Parties acknowledge that this Guarantee and any arbitration ruling,
decision or determination issued under the terms of this Guarantee are
international in nature, and that enforcement of this Guarantee or any ruling,
decision or determination issued under the terms of this Guarantee, will be
governed by the 1958 United Nations Convention on Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitration Rulings.

The cost of the arbitration (other than costs related to translation
arrangements), including attorneys' fees and costs, will be assumed in the
manner specified by the arbitration court.

Without limiting or restricting the above provisions, the Guarantor hereby
agrees that, at the request of any Foreign Party, it will be joined as a party to
any arbitration process initiated under the terms of the Agreement or any
Related Agreement related to compliance by the Corpoven Affiliate with its
obligations under the terms of the Agreement or any Related Agreement. The
Guarantor and each of the Foreign Parties agree that any arbitration process
initiated under the terms and conditions of this Guarantee, may be joined to any
arbitration process initiated under the terms of the Agreement or any Related
Agreement, if the subject matter of the processes is related due to common
legal or factual issues which could result in contradictory rulings or obligations.

The Guarantor and each of the Foreign Parties agree that any ruling issued by
an arbitration court in any of the arbitration processes to which the Guarantor is
a party, will be final and binding upon the Guarantor and each Foreign Party.
The Guarantor and each of the Foreign Parties also agree that any of the
aforementioned arbitration processes (and, as mentioned below, the
appointment of arbitrators) to which they are party, will be substantiated in
accordance with the provisions of the Agreement and the corresponding
Related Agreements. The Guarantor agrees that, for purposes of appointment
of arbitrators and grouping of the parties for the corresponding appointments,

56

the interests and positions of the Guarantor will be understood to be identical to
those of the Corpoven Affiliate (including any Affiliate considered to be a
Corpoven Affiliate pursuant to the provisions of Section 8 of this Guarantee)
and of Corpoven S. A., a business corporation incorporated in accordance with
the laws of the Republic of Venezuela (Corpoven, S. A. and its successors and
any Affiliate of the Corpoven Affiliate to which the rights and obligations of
Corpoven are transferred under the terms of the Development Production
Supply Agreement or the Acknowledgement Agreement, hereinafter referred to
as "Corpoven"); with the understanding that, if the interests and positions of the
Corpoven Affiliate and Corpoven are not identical, the ICA will appoint all of the
arbitrators in the arbitration process.

If any arbitration or ruling issued under the terms of an arbitration conducted in
accordance with the provisions of Section 13 is declared to be invalid and
unenforceable in Venezuela for any reason, at the request of the Guarantor or
any Foreign Party, the Guarantor and each of the Foreign Parties agree to
submit any dispute resulting from or related in any way to this Guarantee or its
enforcement, to binding arbitration conducted by the International Center for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to as "ICSID"), subject
to the arbitration regulations in effect at the Center at the time of the dispute.
The Guarantor and the Foreign Parties agree that, for purposes of the ICSID
arbitration, the activities described in the Agreement and the Related
Agreements will constitute an investment. If the ICSID is unwilling or incapable
of hearing the dispute for any reason, the Guarantor and the Foreign Parties
who are parties to the dispute will select an alternate arbitration venue to
resolve the dispute. Subject to the requirements of the venue in question, all
other provisions included in this Section 13 will remain in full force and effect in
any other arbitration process.

The Respondents’ objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the grounds of the
alleged lack of arbitrability of the Willful Breach Claims is addressed in more detail at
Section IIl.C.3.a below. Their objections to the admissibility of the Discriminatory
Action Claims are addressed at Sections III.B.4.d and III.B.4.e below.

THE DISCRIMINATORY ACTION CLAIM

The Claimants’ position

The Claimants argue that, under Section 9.07 of the Petrozuata AA and Article 14.2
of the Hamaca AA, the Respondents assumed the obligation to indemnify the
Claimants in accordance with the formulae stipulated therein in the event of: (i) the

58

occurrence of a DA;®? and (ii) such DA being deemed compensable for causing either
Significant Economic Damage (under the Petrozuata AA)”° or Material Adverse Effect
(under the Hamaca AA)’' to the Projects. The Claimants submit that the following
measures by the Government constitute DAs for which compensation is due:

i. The income tax increase enacted by the Government in October 2006 with
effect from 1 January 2007, pursuant to which the income tax rate for the
EHCO projects was increased from 34% to 50% (“Income Tax Increase”).’2

ii. The dispossession of the Claimants’ full interests in the Projects in mid-2007
pursuant to the 2007 Nationalization Decree, whereby the Government seized
control of the operations and assets of the Projects (the “Expropriation”).”°
According to the Claimants, the Expropriation “was not limited to a single
confiscatory act, but instead comprised a campaign of coordinated measures
designed to depress the value of, and then to take, the [AAs]”.’4 In this
context, the Claimants refer to: (i) the abrogation of the Royalty Agreement’®
in October 2004, which resulted in an increase in applicable royalty rates from
1% to 16.66% (“Royalty Measure”); and (ii) the introduction of an additional
tax in May 2006, which had the equivalent effect of further increasing the
royalty rate to 33.33% (“Extraction Tax’). For the Claimants, “each of these
coordinated steps [...] must be considered as a constituent part of the
Expropriation, thus rendering the entirety of the Expropriation—and not just
the Projects’ physical confiscation—a [DA] under both AAs”’® (the “Overall
Expropriation”, which thus encompasses the Expropriation, the Royalty

® Discriminatory Action is defined at Section 1.01 of the Petrozuata AA (infra, § 100) and at Article 14.1(b) of the
Hamaca AA (infra, § 106).

70 Significant Economic Damage is defined at Section 1.01 of the Petrozuata AA (infra, § 101).
7 Material Adverse Effect is defined at Article 14.2(a) of the Hamaca AA (infra, §§ 107-108).

72 For the purposes of clarity, the Tribunal has once again elaborated upon the measures/actions of the
Government that the Claimants challenge. However, these qualified measures are as defined in the “Summary of
the Main Facts” (supra, § 27).

73 C-PHB, § 54.
74 C-PHB, § 85.

75 One among the various fiscal measures adopted to incentivize investment into the EHCO projects, was the
reduction of the royalty rate to 1%. This was captured by way of the Royalty Reduction Agreement between
PDVSA Petrdleo, the Ministry, and the concerned EHCO project (C-67).

Measure and the Extraction Tax).’” This is so given that the “AAs expressly

require that the damaging actions be analyzed ‘globally””.”°

95. Contrary to the Respondents’ position,”® the Claimants also emphasize that they have
(i) provided adequate and timely notice for their DA claims; as well as (ii) sufficiently
pursued alternate remedies. Therefore, they cannot be considered to have either
forfeited or waived their rights under the AAs to bring the DA claims.®°

2. The Respondents’ position

96. While the Respondents concede that the Expropriation constitutes a DA,®' they
contest the Overall Expropriation argument raised by the Claimants. In the
Respondents’ view, neither the Royalty Measure nor the Extraction Tax can be
characterized as a DA.®* The Respondents submit that the “global” or “cumulative”
view purported by the Claimants finds no basis in the text of the AAs® or their
negotiation history.64 By the same token, such “cumulative” view disregards the
understanding of “expropriation” under both Venezuelan and international law.®®
Indeed, the Claimants themselves have conceded that the Royalty Measure and the
Extraction Tax do not constitute DAs on a stand-alone basis.® It follows that no

77 The Claimants initially argued that all the “value-reducing measures that preceded the nationalization, i.e. the
Royalty [Measure], the Extraction Tax, and the Income Tax [...] must be considered a constituent part of the
Expropriation, thus rendering the entirety of the Expropriation—and not just the Projects’ physical confiscation—a
Discriminatory Action under both AAs” (Reply, § 170). In other words, the Claimants seemed to characterize the
Income Tax Increase as part of the Overall Expropriation, i.e., as one of the qualified measures to be analyzed
globally or in combination with the Expropriation. Subsequently, however, the Claimants were emphatic that there
are only two DA Claims at issue: the Income Tax Increase, on the one hand, and the Expropriation, on the other
(Tr. (Day 12), 2977:9-19 (Claimants’ Closing Statement)).

Accordingly, the Tribunal understands that: (i) the Income Tax Increase is not part of the Overall Expropriation, as
it constitutes, according to the Claimants, a DA on a stand-alone basis; (ii) only the Royalty Measure and the
Extraction Tax ought to be cumulatively assessed together with the Expropriation in order to ascertain whether
the Overall Expropriation constitutes a DA under each AA; and (iii) the Expropriation and the Overall Expropriation
are not to be deemed as two separate claims, but rather that the Expropriation serves as the main basis for the
Claimants’ Overall Expropriation argument.

compensation or indemnity can be deemed payable to the Claimants for either of

these two measures.®”

97. The Respondents also negate the characterization of the Income Tax Increase as a
DA. They submit that the Income Tax Increase applied to “all Venezuelan taxpayers
deriving income from the production of hydrocarbons, including the mixed companies
emerging from the 2005 migration process for the operating services agreements and
the 2007 migration process for the associations”.®* This being the correct comparator,
the Income Tax Increase cannot be considered as a discriminatory measure. Hence,
it does not constitute a DA.

98. Moreover, the Respondents submit that the Claimants have forfeited their right to
pursue the DA Claim as a result of their failure to (i) notify the Respondents of the
occurrence of a DA in accordance with the specific notice requirements under each
AA;°*9 and (ii) exhaust all local and administrative remedies, as stipulated by the
AAs.°°

3. Relevant contractual provisions

99. Before addressing the Parties’ arguments, the Tribunal first sets out the relevant
provisions in both AAs dealing with DAs.°' Because of their complexity, the Tribunal
transcribes the aforementioned provisions in their entirety.

i. The Petrozuata AA
100. Section 1.01 of the Petrozuata AA defines DAs as follows:

‘Discriminatory Actions’ means any actions, decisions, or changes in law,
adopted by national, state, or municipal, administrative, or legislative
authorities, after a Development Decision has been made, which singly or in
combination, result in unjust discriminatory treatment to [Petrozuata C.A_],
any of its Shareholders (in their capacity as Shareholders), the associations
created under Article 5 of the Organic Law or any of them, or any of their
Shareholders (in their capacity as Shareholders), which are not applicable to
all enterprises in Venezuela and which produce Significant Economic
Damage to the Shareholders of [Petrozuata C.A.] other than [PDVSA Petrdéleo];
provided that:

(a) treatment shall not be considered discriminatory if it equally applies to the
enterprises (empresas) within the oil industry in Venezuela, except that:

(1) with respect to the application of income taxes and any valuations as a
basis for income taxes (e.g. the Fiscal Export Value), treatment shall
be considered discriminatory i is not generally applicable to
most enterprises in Venezuela;

  

(2) with respect to limitations on:
(i) the ability to declare or repatriate dividends outside Venezuela;

(ii) the right to hold abroad the proceeds of the sale of Upgraded
Crude Oil in non-Venezuelan currency; and

(iii) the unencumbered convertibility of non-Venezuelan currency
into Venezuelan currency (and vice versa) at a free, universal
market rate;

treatment shall be considered discriminatory if it is not generally
applicable to most enterprises in Venezuela;

(3) even if treatment equally applies to the enterprises within the oil
industry in Venezuela, treatment may nevertheless be
discriminatory if after analyzing globally all actions, decisions, or,
changes in law that have been adopted in parallel or within a
reasonable period of time, such actions, decisions, or changes in law
resulted in economic damage to the shareholders of [Petrozuata C.A.],
that was not actually suffered by government owned companies
within the oil industry, or, if suffered by government owned
companies within the oil industry, the negative impact on [Petrozuata
C.A. is disproportionately onerous as compared to the
government owned companies within the oil industry, it being
understood, however, that if special favorable treatment applicable only
to the government owned companies is adopted, such treatment shall
not be considered per se discriminatory.

 

 

(b) with respect to municipal taxes, if applicable to any of [Petrozuata C.A.’s]
activities, treatment shall be considered discriminatory if the tariff rate
applicable is higher than the highest tariff rate applicable to the industrial
activity classification(s), as agreed by the Parties and attached hereto as
Exhibit “Q,” which have enterprises in actual operation in the corresponding
municipality; and

(c) treatment adopted for the purpose of implementing technical or operational
regulations relating to safety or the protection of the environment shall not be
considered discriminatory:

For the purpose of this definition, treatment shall be considered unjust if
it results in Significant Economic Damage (as defined below) and such
Damage is subject to compensation under the terms of Section 9.07 of
this Agreement.°2

 

101. In turn, Significant Economic Damage (“SED”) is defined under the Petrozuata AA as:

[E]lconomic damage arising as a result of Discriminatory Actions during any
fiscal year, which amounts to at least US $6.5 million (inflated from 1994 Dollars

°2 Petrozuata AA, C-1, Section 1.01 (emphasis added).

62

to the then current time by the US Inflation Index) for all Class B Shareholders
[i.e., CPZ]. Such economic damage shall be determined by calculating any loan
repayments or dividends that [CPZ] would have otherwise received and could
otherwise have repatriated in a given fiscal year had no Discriminatory Actions
occurred and subtracting therefrom the dividends, Advances thereon and loan
repayments, that were actually received and repatriated in that fiscal year by
[cPz].23

102. With due regard to the above provisions, Section 9.07 of the Petrozuata AA further
stipulates that PDVSA Petrdleo (and PDVSA, as Guarantor under the Guaranty) is
obligated to indemnify the Claimants for the SED suffered by virtue of DAs taken by
Venezuela. In particular, Section 9.07 provides that:

[I]n the event that a Class B Shareholder [i.e., CPZ] suffers in any fiscal year
Significant Economic Damage as a result of any Discriminatory Actions
(‘Injured Shareholder”), such Injured Shareholder shall be compensated by the
Class A Privileged Shareholder [i. PDVSA Petréleo] for the economic
damage suffered by virtue of the Discriminatory Actions.

 

103. Sections 9.07(a) to (c) then proceed to set out the modalities and formula based on
which compensation payable to the Injured Shareholder shall be calculated and paid.
These are not relevant in the present analysis on liability. Hence, to the extent
necessary, they will only be referred to in the Quantum section below.%

104. Subsequently, Section 9.07(d) deals with the purported exhaustion of legal remedies.
It provides as follows:

(d) [CPZ] shall, to the fullest extent practicable, commence and exhaust all
available legal and administrative actions which may provide a remedy
from the application of such Discriminatory Actions. If any such actions are
available, [PDVSA Petrdleo] may retain any amounts due under this Section
9.07 (which shall accrue interest at the Base Rate) until the earlier of: (i) the
third anniversary date of the commencement of legal and administrative
actions, provided they have been diligently pursued; (ii) the exhaustion of
available legal and administrative actions; or (iii) [CPZ]’s success in obtaining a
remedy from the application of the corresponding Discriminatory Actions; at
which time [PDVSA Petrdéleo] shall pay to [CPZ] any amount owed (with interest
at the Base Rate) which has not been compensated for with a remedy and shall
thereafter make any additional payments required hereunder when due. If there
is compensation under (i) above, [CPZ] shall diligently continue to pursue and
exhaust any available remedies, or [CPZ] otherwise obtains economic relief
intended to offset the Discriminatory Action, directly or indirectly, as a result of
another legislative or administrative action which was not generally applicable
to most enterprises in Venezuela, then: (1) [CPZ] shall refund to [PDVSA
Petrdleo] any discrimination compensation already paid which corresponds to
the remedy or relief which has been obtained by [CPZ] (plus interest at the

105.

106.

Base Rate); and/or (2) the damages shall be recalculated to take into
consideration the remedy or economic relief obtained, as the case may be.%

Finally, Section 9.07(e) addresses the purported notice requirements as follows:

(e) The right to compensation of [CPZ] under this Section 9.07 shall be
limited to those damages actually suffered by such Shareholder beginning
with the fiscal year previous to the year in which a written notice is sent to
[PDVSA Petrdleo], indicating that the notifying Shareholder considers that a
Discriminatory Action has taken place.°”

The Hamaca AA

Article 14.1(b) of the Hamaca AA defines a DA as:

[A]ny change of Venezuelan national, state or municipal law, or any act or
action with force of law, act of government (actos de gobierno), or action or
decision of any Venezuelan national, state or municipal legislative or
administrative authority (including any such action or decision resulting in a
change in interpretation or application of Venezuelan law), which is (i)
applicable to the Association, the Association Entities or a Party in its capacity
as a participant in the Association or an Association Entity, (ii) unjust and (iii)
not generally applicable to entities (both public and private) engaged on their
own behalf (e.g., excluding service contract providers in the performance of
such service activities) in the hydrocarbon industry in Venezuela; provided that:

(1) any change of Venezuelan national, state or municipal law, or any
act or action with force of law, act of government, or action or
decision of any Venezuelan national, state or municipal legislative
or administrative authority (including any such action or decision
resulting in a change in interpretation or application of Venezuelan law)
in respect of tax rates (including value added taxes, such as
impuestos a las ventas al mayor, and the legal procedure established
for its recovery), new taxes, financial burdens or charges for goods and
services provided by governmental entities which are the equivalent of a
tax (i.e., financial burdens or charges on goods or services imposed by
a governmental entity acting as the sole provider of such goods or
services or in regulating an activity conducted under monopoly
conditions), foreign exchange controls or the expropriation of the
assets of, or a Party's interest in, the Association or Association
Entities, will be considered Discriminatory Actions if they are not
generally applicable to corporations and other legal entities that
are taxable in the same manner as corporations in Venezuela;

 

 

 

 

(2) the application of methods to determine transfer pricing for the purpose
of taxes payable in respect of Extra-Heavy Oil (as recovered or
industrialized) or Commercial Production produced by the Parties in
their capacity as participants in the Association or goods and services
provided in connection with the Project activities shall be considered
Discriminatory Actions if such methods are not generally consistent with
internationally recognized transfer pricing principles for taxation;

(3) a binding determination by any competent Venezuelan authority that the
Association Entities or the Parties in their capacity as participants in the

Association or in the Association Entities, are subject to taxation under
a regime less favorable to the Parties than paragraph unique of Article 9
of the Venezuelan Income Tax Law (i.e., a regime less favorable to the
Parties than that generally applicable to corporations and other legal
entities that are taxable in the same manner as corporations in
Venezuela) shall be considered a Discriminatory Action;

(4) reductions or increases in the royalty rate applicable to the crude
oil produced by the Parties in their capacity as participants in the
Association, will not be considered Discriminatory Actions under
this provision unless such changes result in a royalty rate for the
Parties in their capacity as participants in the Association, in
excess of the maximum rate specified by law for the hydrocarbon
industry in general; and

 

  

 

(5) the imposition of municipal taxes (patente de industria y comercio) on
the Parties in their capacity as participants in the Association or on the
Association Entities, in spite of the provisions of the Conditions, will be
considered a Discriminatory Action only if the aggregate municipal tax
burden on the Affected Party's gross revenue from Project activities
exceeds four percent (4%) of the Affected Party's gross revenue from
Project activities in the relevant Fiscal Year, in which event the full
amount of all municipal taxes will be taken into account in computing
decreased Reference Net Cash Flow (calculated in accordance with
Section 14.2(f)) for purposes of ascertaining whether the Affected Party
has suffered a Material Adverse Effect (although the Affected Party will
be compensated only for the decrease in Reference Net Cash Flow
attributable to municipal taxes over four percent (4%)).

For the purposes of this Article XIV, “act of government” (actos de gobierno)
shall mean any act of the higher bodies of the executive power directly based
on the constitution of the Republic of Venezuela not related to formal law, but
similarly enforceable.%*

107. Under the Hamaca AA, the Claimants’ entitlement to receive compensation due to the
enactment of a DA does not arise out of the causation of SED. Rather, the Hamaca
AA refers to the equivalent notion of Material Adverse Effect (“MAE”). In particular,
Article 14.2(a) states the following:

Corpoven Sub shall be required to compensate any Foreign Party, in the
manner described in this Article XIV, to the extent that the Party suffers a
reduction of more than five percent (5%) in any Fiscal Year in its
Reference Net Cash Flow as the result of one or more Discriminatory
Actions (including Discriminatory Actions occurring after, but having an
effect on the Reference Net Cash Flow from, such year) (any such Party,
an “Affected Party”), with such reduction being determined by comparing, with
respect to any Party in any Fiscal Year, such Party's Reference Net Cash Flow
for such year, including the effect of all uncompensated Discriminatory Actions,
with the Party's Reference Net Cash Flow for such year excluding the effect of
the uncompensated Discriminatory Actions (such reduction, a “Material Adverse
Effect’), it being understood that any Discriminatory Actions would be
considered unjust if they resulted, individually or in the aggregate, in a
Material Adverse Effect.

has occurred, it promptly shall give notice thereof (a “Notice of
Discriminatory Act") to Corpoven Sub and shall indicate whether it
believe[s] that such Discriminatory Action will result in Material Adverse
Effect. Promptly following receipt of such a notice, Corpoven Sub shall
inform the notifying Party of whether or not Corpoven Sub agrees that
the notified action is a Discriminatory Action which may lead to a
Material Adverse Effect. Following Corpoven Sub’s response, the
claiming Party (the “Claiming Party”) [i.e. CPH] and Corpoven Sub shall
promptly meet to discuss the formal legal remedies, such as court or
administrative proceedings, that may be appropriate to reverse or
obtain relief from the alleged Discriminatory Action, and [CPH] shall
commence independently (or if Corpoven Sub so requests, together
with Corpoven Sub) and pursue such remedies. [CPH] shall diligently
pursue any such proceedings commenced and any net proceeds
received by [CPH] as a result of such pursuit, net of legal fees and
costs, shall be applied against any amounts ultimately determined to be
owing by Corporven Sub to [CPH] or reimbursed to Corpoven Sub if
Corpoven Sub has previously made payments to [CPH] in respect of
such Discriminatory Action.

Notwithstanding the pendency of formal legal proceedings, if any, in the
event that any Foreign Party believes that it has suffered a Material
Adverse Effect in any Fiscal Year as the result of actions in respect of
which it had delivered Notices of Discriminatory Action, such Party shall
be entitled to give notice to that effect (a “Notice of Triggering Event”) to
Corpoven Sub; provided that each Party will be entitled to deliver only
one Notice of Triggering Event during each Fiscal Year of the
Association.

Upon delivery of a Notice of Triggering Event, Corpoven Sub and the
Claiming Party shall enter into good faith negotiations regarding
whether each of the actions in respect of which a Notice of
Discriminatory Action had been delivered was, in fact, a Discriminatory
Action (to the extent such issue had not been previously agreed upon
by Corpoven Sub and the Claiming Party or determined by arbitration in
prior years) and whether the Claiming Party had suffered a Material
Adverse Effect. If Corpoven Sub and the Claiming Party agree that a
Discriminatory Action resulting in a Material Adverse Effect has
occurred, and that the Claiming Party is thus an Affected Party, the
Parties shall enter into good faith negotiations regarding the

Amendments; provided that the Amendments shall not result in a cost
to Corpoven Sub exceeding the Damages actually suffered by the
Affected Party (or, if more than one Party is an Affected Party, the
Affected Parties).1°?

Analysis

In light of the relevant contractual provisions of both AAs cited above, and subject to
the further analysis on liability that follows, it is the Tribunal’s understanding that,

broadly speaking, a DA exists where a given measure(s) is/are: (i) “discriminatory”;
and (ii) “unjust” as a result of causing either SED or MAE."

In this context, the Tribunal first notes that the Parties agree that the Income Tax
Increase, the Royalty Measure, the Extraction Tax and the Expropriation all represent
either: (i) “actions, decisions, or changes in law, adopted by [Venezuelan] national,
state, or municipal, administrative, or legislative authorities”;'° or (ii) “change[s] of
Venezuelan national, state or municipal law, or [acts] or action[s] with force of law,
act[s] of government (actos de gobierno), or action[{s] or decision[s] of any
Venezuelan national, state or municipal legislative or administrative authority
(including any such action or decision resulting in a change in interpretation or
application of Venezuelan law)”.'° Accordingly, all of the foregoing qualified
measures fall under the purview of the relevant DA provisions of both AAs.1°°

The Claimants put forward two sets of qualified measures that, in their view,
constitute DAs: the Income Tax Increase and the Overall Expropriation, the latter

being comprised of the Royalty Measure, the Extraction Tax and the Expropriation.

As to the Respondents, they dispute the Claimants’ position. Overall, it is the
Respondents’ contention that the Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax cannot be
cumulatively assessed with the Expropriation.” That said, the Respondents
acknowledge that the Expropriation in and of itself constitutes a discriminatory and
unjust measure (i.e. an independent DA).1°

Thus, based on the Parties’ outstanding submissions and contentions, the Tribunal
must answer the following questions in connection with the DA claims:

a. Does the Overall Expropriation comply with the first prong for a qualified
measure to be deemed a DA? Accordingly, is the Overall Expropriation (or its
constitutive measures in dispute, namely, the Royalty Measure and/or the
Extraction Tax) “discriminatory’?'°

b. Does the Income Tax Increase comply with the first prong for a qualified
measure to be deemed a DA? Accordingly, is the Income Tax Increase
“discriminatory’?""°

c. Does the Income Tax Increase and/or the Overall Expopriation (or its constitutive
measures in dispute) comply with the second prong for a qualified measure to be
deemed a DA? Accordingly, are the Income Tax Increase and/or the Overall
Expropriation (or its constitutive measures in dispute) “unjust” for causing SED or
MAE?

d. Were the Claimants required to notify the Respondents that, in their view, the
Overall Expropriation (or its constitutive measures) and the Income Tax Increase
constituted DAs? If so, have the Claimants complied with the notification
requirement? If not, what are the consequences of such non-compliance?

e. Were the Claimants required to exhaust local and administrative remedies? If so,
have the Claimants complied with this requirement? If not, what are the
consequences of such non-compliance?

The Tribunal now turns to the discussion of each of these issues.

First prong for a qualified measure to be deemed a DA: the alleged
discriminatory nature of the Overall Expropriation

The Respondents concede that the Expropriation, effected by means of the 2007
Nationalization Decree, constitutes a DA under both AAs.'' The issue in dispute
between the Parties is thus whether the Overall Expropriation (i.e. the Royalty

120.

Measure, the Extraction Tax and the Expropriation taken together) should also be
characterized as such.

For the Claimants the issue is clear: the Overall Expropriation constitutes a
compensable DA pursuant to which the Respondents are required to indemnify the
Claimants for the losses suffered.1'2 However, the Tribunal observes that the
arguments raised by the Claimants in this context vary considerably depending on
whether the Overall Expropriation issue is to be assessed under the Petrozuata AA or
the Hamaca AA. For the sake of consistency, the Tribunal will follow the Claimants’
underlying structure with respect to this argument. Hence, it will assess the alleged
discriminatory nature of the Overall Expropriation under each AA separately.1'>

i. Under the Petrozuata AA

The Claimants allege that they were subjected to “one deliberate, coordinated
campaign [...] designed [...] to lead to the burial of the AAs [...]”.1"4 In support of this
assertion, the Claimants refer to Chavez's 2007 Speech equating the Royalty
Measure and the Extraction Tax with progressive “steps” leading-up to the
Expropriation." The Claimants also refer to the academic opinion of Ms. Rondén de
Sas6 (former judge of the Venezuelan Supreme Court and legal adviser to PDVSA),
describing the abovementioned succession of qualified measures as, inter alia,
“intended” and “established” to “eliminate the [AAs]”.""¢

With this factual matrix in mind, the Claimants submit that “each of these coordinated
steps (the successive fiscal measures, and the final dispossession) must be
considered a constituent part of the Expropriation, thus rendering the [Overall
Expropriation] — and not just the Projects’ physical confiscation — a Discriminatory
Action [...]".117

In the Claimants’ view, the characterization of the Overall Expropriation as a DA is
recognized in “express terms” by the Petrozuata AA‘'® due to the following two

reasons. First, the chapeau of Section 1.01 of the AA allows the consideration of
qualified measures “in combination” for the purposes of assessing whether they can
be defined as a DA.'° Second, and contributing to the definition of DA, the Claimants
emphasize that Section 1.01(a)(3) of the AA reads as follows:

[T]reatment may nevertheless be discriminatory, if, after analysing globally all
actions, decisions and changes in law that have been adopted in parallel or
within a reasonable period of time, such actions, decisions and changes in law
resulted in economic damage to the shareholders of the Company [...].12°
Relying on Mr. van Wageningen’s testimony, the Claimants explain that the aforesaid
definition was designed to protect them from “death by a thousand cuts”.'2’ As stated
by Mr. van Wageningen at the Hearing, the Claimants:

[W]anted to make sure that the concept was that you might have an individual

Discriminatory Action, but you could also amalgamate several circumstances

and events which, together or globally, would create a Discriminatory Action.

That was our intent when we drafted it.122
The Claimants thus explain that the Royalty Measure, the Extraction Tax, and the
Expropriation, jointly, constitute an Overall Expropriation falling under the definition of
DA because: (i) each of these measures were intended to progressively affect the
value of the Projects, paving the way for the Expropriation to take place (a qualified
measure that the Respondents concede constitutes a DA); and (ii) the terms “in
combination” and “analysing globally” contained in Section 1.01 of the Petrozuata AA
explicitly permit such a cumulative approach.

The Respondents, on the other hand, stress that, in line with the Claimants’ own
concessions, neither the Royalty Measure nor the Extraction Tax can be categorized
as DAs on a stand-alone basis.'?? Consequently, the aggregation of non-DAs (and
presumably, the aggregation of non-DAs with a DA such as the Expropriation) cannot
create a distinct DA. In the Respondents’ words, “one apple and one orange do not
equal two apples”.124

According to the Respondents, the Claimants have misconstrued the way qualified
measures can be aggregated for the purposes of obtaining compensation for the

harm caused by a DA. In support of their argument, the Respondents rely in particular
on the definition of SED set forth in Sections 9.07 and 1.01 of the Petrozuata AA.

As to Section 9.07 of the Petrozuata AA, the Respondents recall that only if Conoco
suffers SED “as a result of any Discriminatory Action” could it be compensated “for
the economic damage suffered as_a result of the Discriminatory Actions”.17° Thus
“there can be no genuine dispute that compensation under the Compensation
Provisions is payable only for ‘Discriminatory Actions’ [...]. [A contrario] no
compensation of any kind is provided for governmental measures that are not
‘Discriminatory Actions’”.126

With the foregoing in mind, the Respondents point next to Section 1.01 of the
Petrozuata AA, which defines SED as “economic damage arising as_a_result of
Discriminatory Actions during any fiscal year, which amounts to at least USD $6.5
million [...] for all Class B Shareholders”.'27 In light of this provision, they argue that
both AAs contain “de minimis exceptions to the State company’s obligation to
compensate the private party for governmental actions, meaning that if the impact of
‘Discriminatory Actions’ is below the threshold, no compensation is granted”.'78 Thus,
again referring to an a contrario argument, the Respondents explain that
compensation is not payable unless the “total” economic damage arising as a result
of a DA causes harm above USD 6.5 million.'29 In other words, the Petrozuata AA
does allow for accumulation, but only with respect to damages resulting from qualified
measures previously characterized as DAs—‘it does not allow for the accumulation of
economic damage resulting from non-Discriminatory Actions”, such as the Royalty
Measure and the Extraction Tax.'®° Any other conclusion would uphold the absurd

proposition that non-DAs can also be compensable.*3*

In support of their argument, the Respondents also rely on Mr. Wageningen’s
testimony. Putting the Claimants’ allegory of “death by a thousand cuts” in context,'9?

the Respondents refer to Mr. van Wageningen’s witness statement recounting the
negotiation of Petrozuata’s DA provisions:

In negotiating the DA provisions, Conoco was careful to ensure that both
individual and cumulative harm from Government actions would be covered. In
light of my experience with other projects in many different countries, | was
concerned about the risk of “death by a thousand cuts”, meaning a number of
individual acts by the Government (at whatever level), which when taken
together had a significant adverse effect on Conoco’s investments in the
Project. As | wrote to Dr. Carrillo during the negotiations: “we want to
make sure that Signifi ic Damage be i
[Conoco] can be damaged bit by bit by events, circumstances or legal
legislative actions each of which by itself would not consist of Significant
Economic Damage, but cumulatively would make our continued
involvement untenable. ‘°°
On the basis of the above testimony, the Respondents conclude that, in accordance
with both the text and negotiating history of the Petrozuata AA, the cumulative
approach suggested by the Claimants is only germane to facilitate surpassing the de
minimis threshold required for establishing SED. Hence, while the aggregation of
damages from qualified measures is permitted, the said measures must first and
foremost satisfy the conditions to constitute a DA. The Petrozuata AA does not
contemplate or permit the aggregation of damages resulting from non-DAs.
Therefore, the characterization of the Overall Expropriation as a compensable DA

must be rejected.

As discussed further below, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondents’ general
conclusion that the notion of DA under the Petrouzuata AA does not allow for the
aggregation of non-DAs in a way that would render these separate measures a
compensable DA. That said, and as also observed by the Claimants, the
Respondents’ position chiefly focuses on the definition of SED. Therefore it does not
directly engage with the Claimants’ main argument which is based on the definiton of
Discriminatory Action and which focuses on the meaning of the terms “in
combination” and “analysing globally”.4

183 van Wageningen WS |, CWS-1, § 22 (emphasis added). The Respondents further refer to the letter quoted
therein, sent by Mr. van Wageningen to Mr. Tomas Carrillo (Maraven’s Manager of International Legal Affairs).
The relevant full paragraph of that letter (and not only the excerpt quoted in Mr. van Wageningen’s witness
statement), reads as follows: “Finally, we want to make sure that Significant Economic Damage be cumulative
because Conven can be damaged bit by bit by events, circumstances or legal legislative actions each of which by
itself would not consist of Significant Economic Damage, but cumulatively would make our continued involvement
untenable. The benchmark for such cumulative damages should be the economic and legal conditions at the
Effective Date of the HOP with all subsequent economic damage accumulated until it meets the threshold of
Significant Economic Damage” (C-27/12; R-PHB, § 516).

134 C-PHB, § 92.

130.

133.

On the other hand, however, the Tribunal also observes that the Claimants’ main
argument does not analyze these two key terms of Section 1.01 in their proper
context: the Claimants pay insufficient regard to the fact that the term “in combination”
finds itself in the chapeau of Section 1.01, while the term “analyzing globally” only
appears in Section 1.01(a)(3). For the reasons given in the analysis below, the
Claimants’ cumulative approach is therefore unpersuasive.

The chapeau of Section 1.01 of the Petrozuata AA states that, for DAs to exist,
qualified measures, “singly or in combination, [must] result in unjust discriminatory
treatment”.'°5 In other words, qualified measures must be both “unjust” and
“discriminatory” in order to be considered as DAs, this being the core of the
definition of DA set forth in Section 1.01, particularly considering that the terms
“unjust” and “discriminatory” are both given content in the remainder of the

provision.196

As to the term “unjust”, the Petrozuata AA expressly links it to the notion of SED. The
last paragraph of Section 1.01 explicitly states that, “for the purpose of [the definition
of DAs], treatment shall be considered unjust if it results in [SED] and such [SED] is
subject to compensation under the terms of Section 9.07 of this Agreement”.*5”
Indeed, throughout the entire Petrozuata AA, the term “unjust” is only defined by way
of what amounts to SED, nothing else.'°*

As to the issue of what comprises “discriminatory” treatment, it is considerably less
straightforward, as it appears to be contingent on the type and scope of the qualified
measure in question. If the qualified measure is general and does not fall within any
of the categories below,'®® then treatment shall be considered discriminatory only if
the measure is not “applicable to all enterprises in Venezuela”.4° In turn, if the
qualified measure:

185 Petrozuata AA, C-1, Section 1.01 (emphasis added); supra, § 100.

186 As explained in further detail below when addressing the Hamaca AA (infra, §§ 162.i-162.ii), it is worth noting
that if the terms “unjust” and “discriminatory” of Section 1.01 of the Petrozuata AA are read as constituting the
basis of what can be deemed a DA under the Petrozuata AA, then there are no significant differences between
the AAs in terms of their definition of DA.

‘87 Petrozuata AA, C-1, Section 1.01 (emphasis added); supra, § 102.

138 The Claimants themselves identify the same connection between the “unjust” criteria and SED, when they
state that a measure is unjust if it results in SED (C-PHB, §§ 65-67).

approach to DAs."4° The Tribunal first observes that the chapeau of Section 1.01 of
the Petrozuata AA does envision that qualified measures may, “singly or in
combination”, result in “unjust” discriminatory treatment. Given the explicit link
between the term “unjust” and the notion of SED, the same logic should extend to the
latter, namely, a series of qualified measures can be considered in the aggregate to
determine whether SED has taken place, and thus whether the de minimis threshold
of USD 6.5 million has been surpassed. In light of the Respondents’ position that
SED can arise cumulatively, it appears that this is a minimum common
denominator between the Parties."5"

The key issue is hence whether the chapeau of Section 1.01 of the Petrozuata AA
also permits that a series of qualified measures may, “in combination”, result in
“discriminatory” treatment. For the Tribunal, the answer is yes, although this finding
does not necessarily support the Claimants’ Overall Expropriation DA claim.

The cumulative approach to discriminatory treatment foreshadowed in the chapeau of
Section 1.01 is only further endorsed by the term “analyzing globally” in Section
1.01(a)(3) of the Petrozuata AA. No other part of Section 1.01 contains language
enabling either the Parties (under Section 9.07(e)) or a decision-maker (under
Section 13.16) to globally consider a series of qualified measures for the purposes of
concluding whether they constitute DAs on the grounds of being discriminatory. The
Claimants themselves admit that their argument is mostly based on the reference to
“in combination” in the chapeau and the reference to “analyzing globally” in Section
1.01 (a)(3).1%

It follows that, while the chapeau indeed suggests that all qualified measures can be
considered “in combination”, Section 1.01(a)(3) circumscribes that prerogative to
those measures that, ab initio, “equally appl[y] to the enterprises within the oil
industry”, but that, in effect, do not. In other words, as discussed further below,
Section 1.01(a)(3) focuses on the cumulative effect of formally non-discriminatory
qualified measures in order to asses whether, analyzed together, the accorded final
treatment is discriminatory. Such a construction is in line with the overall structure of
Section 1.01 of the Petrozuata AA.

Generally speaking, all other categories of qualified measures are either: (i) not
discriminatory;'* (ii) discriminatory if not generally applicable to all/most enterprises
in Venezuela;"® or (iii) discriminatory if at odds with a technically defined standard."5°
Against either of these explicit benchmarks, it would have been unnecessary for the
Parties to agree to a cumulative approach. In turn, if the purpose is to draw a
distinction between those qualified measures that, on their face, “equally appl[y] to
the enterprises within the oil industry” (which, in principle, “shall not be considered
discriminatory”),'*” from those measures that do not entail equal treatment even
within the Venezuelan oil industry, then taking all the relevant qualified measures in
the aggregate is entirely sensible.

It is in light of the above that the Claimants’ reliance on Section 1.01(a)(3) of the
Petrozuata AA lacks context. The Claimants argue that “[uJnder the Petrozuata AA,
the definition of ‘Discriminatory Actions’ states how measures qualify as
Discriminatory Actions, before addressing the second question of whether they meet
the separate qualification of crossing over the value threshold of Significant Economic
Damage”.'®® Then, referring to Section 1.01(a)(3), the Claimants contend that the
“definition of [DAs] provides: [T]reatment may nevertheless be discriminatory, if, after
analyzing globally all [qualified measures] that have been adopted in parallel or within
a reasonable period of time, such [qualified measures] resulted in economic damage
to the shareholders of the Company [...]”.1°

Nevertheless, it is not accurate to say that a qualified measure must first be deemed
a DA before assessing whether it has caused a SED. As already established, a
qualified measure may constitute a DA precisely because it is “unjust” and, as such,
entails SED." Further, as seen, Section 1.01(a)(3) does not define what is
understood as a DA under the Petrozuata AA."*' It only deals with one of the two
requirements thereof, namely, discriminatory treatment. It limits itself to cater for what

can constitute discriminatory treatment in cases where the qualified measures at

stake are applicable to the Venezuelan oil industry. Moreover, Section 1.01(a)(3) is
rather specific as to the categories of qualified measures to which it applies to. In
other words, while it allows for taking qualified measures in the aggregate for
discrimination purposes, Section 1.01(a)(3) clearly specifies the way in which a global

analysis is to take place.

As the Claimants point out, Section 1.01(a)(3) treatment may nevertheless be
discriminatory if, after “analyzing globally”, a series of qualified measures “adopted in
parallel or within a reasonable period of time” result in “economic damage to the
shareholders of the Company”.'®? The Claimants’ analysis stops here; however,
Section 1.01(a)(3) does not.

Section 1.01(a)(3) goes on to distinguish two categories of “economic damage”
(which is a concept different to that of SED) against which the qualified measures in
question can be “analyz[ed] globally’. The first category consists of “economic
damage” that “was not actually suffered by government owned companies within the
oil industry’.‘*° The second category contemplates “economic damage” which might
have also been “suffered by government owned companies within the oil industry,
[but where] the negative impact on [Petrozuata C.A. was] disproportionately
onerous as compared to the government owned companies within the oil industry”.
Thus, if either of these “economic damage[s]” is ascertained as a result of a
cumulative/global analysis of the relevant qualified measures in question (i.e., those
“adopted in parallel or within a reasonable period of time”), they could be deemed
discriminatory despite being, facially, “equally applicable to enterprises within the oil

industry in Venezuela’.

As explained below,'® it is therefore clear that the Claimants’ Overall Expropriation
DA claim is at odds with the standards set out in Section 1.01(a)(3) of the Petrozuata
AA.

The text of Section 1.01(a)(3) only allows to controvert non-discriminatory qualified
measures (i.e. that at the outset accord treatment equally applicable to enterprises
within the oil industry in Venezuela) by way of their cumulative effect. Put differently, it
is the effect of a series of qualified measures that renders them discriminatory. It is for

this reason that Section 1.01(a)(3) provides two categories of “economic damages”.
In essence, the only relevant criteria to second-guess the non-discriminatory nature
of a series of qualified measures is if their global analysis leads to the conclusion that
the resulting “economic damage” (as defined in Section 1.01(a)(3)) is discriminatory.
In fact, such an effects-based lodestar is not only incidental to Section 1.01(a)(3), but
also to the entire Section 1.01 in the sense that regardless of the public qualified
measures in question (income tax increase, repatriation of dividends, municipal taxes,
etc.), it is the treatment (i.e. the effect) of that measure that makes it discriminatory.

As far as the possibility of aggregating qualified measures is concerned, the intent
behind the issuance of the said measures therefore seems irrelevant. To some
extent, such understanding is consistent with Mr. van Wageningen’s testimony. As
highlighted by the Respondents,'®” Mr. van Wageningen’s concern over the risk of
“death by a thousand cuts” was mainly (if not exclusively) associated with the notion
of SED. In particular, one of Mr. van Wageningen’s concerns while negotiating the
Petrozuata AA was to “make sure that Significant Economic Damage be
cumulative because [Conoco] can be damaged bit by bit by events, circumstances
or legal legislative actions each of which by itself would not consist of Significant
Economic Damage, but cumulatively would make our continued involvement
untenable”.'®° While the foregoing only concerns the “unjust” requirement of DAs (i.e.
the causation of SED), it caters to the finding that the cumulative analysis of qualified
measures was not meant to be subjective.

Overall, the Claimants have failed to establish any textual basis or otherwise
convincing argument with respect to the the Petrozuata AA, whereby the intention
behind the adoption of a series of qualified measures should be considered to
categorize them as DAs (be it for being discriminatory or unjust). Consequently, the
Tribunal considers that the Claimants’ reliance on President Chavez's 2007 Speech

witness statement is considerably more exhaustive than his oral testimony; (ii) when asked at the Hearing
whether he wanted make any corrections to his witness statements, Mr. van Wageningen answered in the
negative (Tr. (Day 3), 706:16-22); and (iii) in any event, the link between the risk of “death by a thousand cuts”
and that of SED made in his witness statement is not flat out contrary to Mr. van Wageningen’s understanding at
the Hearing (Tr. (Day 3), 714: 10-15).

and Ms. Rondon de Sasé6 opinion is, in the context of the Petrozuata AA and its DA

provisions, entirely inapposite.'®°

It follows that, considering the exclusive effects-based criteria in Section 1.01(a)(3),
neither the Royalty Measure nor the Extraction Tax can be deemed discriminatory.
“Analyz[ed] globally”, both of these qualified measures were equally applicable to the
enterprises within the Venezuelan oil industry. Moreover:

i. The Claimants have not argued, let alone demonstrated that the “economic
damage” resulting from their cumulative application was “not actually suffered”
by government owned companies within the oil industry. In fact, it appears
undisputed that both the Claimants and all other private hydrocarbon
operators, on the one hand, and PDVSA and its affiliates, on the other, were
formally and materially subject to: (i) a 16.66% extraction tax from 2004 to
2006 (as a result of the Royalty Measure); and (ii) a 33.33% extraction tax
from 2006 onwards (as a result of the Extraction Tax).17°

ii. Likewise, the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the “economic
damage” resulting from their cumulative application was “disproportionately
onerous” as compared to the one suffered by PDVSA, its affiliates, or any

other government owned oil company.

The pivotal issue is then whether, in light of the Expropriation, the Royalty Measure
and the Extraction Tax can nonetheless be deemed discriminatory. In the Tribunal’s

view, this question must be answered in the negative.

Section 1.01(a)(3) certainly permits assessing whether a series of ab initio non-
discriminatory qualified measures generate discriminatory treatment as defined
therein. However, such assessment must not be mistaken with an endorsement to
aggregate non-discriminatory qualified measures with those that are discriminatory
and, in fact, unquestionably so. There is nothing in the language of Section
1.01(a)(3), or in the entire Section 1.01 for that matter, that would permit the
accumulation of non-discriminatory and discriminatory qualified measures: (i) to
render non-discriminatory qualified measures discriminatory; or (ii) conversely, to

extend the treatment of measures qualified as discriminatory to non-discriminatory

measures.

Turning to the facts of the present case, it is evident that the effect of the
Expropriation was distinct from the treatment accorded by the Royalty Measure
and/or the Extraction Tax. It cannot be seriously argued that, because of the 2007
Expropriation, the “economic damage” caused by the Royalty Measure and/or the
Extraction was not “actually suffered” by government owned companies.'”' It would
be equally contrived to argue that, because of the Expropriation, the “economic
damage” caused to the Claimants by the Royalty Measure and/or the Extraction Tax
was, suddenly, “disproportionately onerous” as compared to the damage suffered by
government owned companies.*72

The crux of the Claimants’ Overall Expropriation DA Claim is that the alleged
coordinated intent behind the Royalty Measure, the Extraction Tax and the
Expropriation is material for their cumulative analysis.'7? However, as seen, Section
1.01(a)(3) only allows for a cumulative assessment of qualified measures in light of
an effects-based criterion.'4 On that footing, the Claimants’ proposition is untenable:
if non-discriminatory measures could be cumulatively assessed without paying due
regard to their individual effect (as the Claimants seemingly suggest), then it would
only take one measure clearly according discriminatory treatment to carry forward all
damages caused by an undetermined number of preceding non-discriminatory
measures. Such a counterintuitive interpretation would entirely circumvent the whole
purpose of Section 1.01 of the Petrozuata AA. As the Respondents submit,'’° such a
view leads to the absurd result that non-DAs could be deemed compensable: a
position that the Tribunal cannot uphold.

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal determines that the Royalty Measure and
the Extraction Tax are not, individually, discriminatory under the Petrozuata AA,
something that is not disputed by the Claimants.'”® The same conclusion stands even
if these two measures are being “analyz[ed] globally” along with the Expropriation.

Consequently, the Overall Expropriation cannot be qualified as a discriminatory
measure under the Petrozuata AA.

ji. Under the Hamaca AA

153. Building on the same factual premises laid out in the context of the Petrozuata AA,'7”
the Claimants argue that the Overall Expropriation is a DA under the Hamaca AA.
The textual base for the Claimants’ claim is Article 14.1(b)(1) of the Hamaca AA.
Rather than referring to criteria catering to a cumulative analysis of qualified
measures (like under Section 1.01(a)(3) of the Petrozuata AA), Article 14.1(b)(1) of
the Hamaca AA incorporates the concept of “expropriation” in its definition of DAs."7®

154. In this regard, the Claimants refer to Mr. Manning's testimony, explaining that “Phillips
wanted contractual indemnification from harmful effects of Government measures
considered separately or all together”.”? The Claimants also stress that the AAs are
governed by Venezuelan law, “which recognizes that expropriation can constitute a
series of regulatory acts that together have the cumulative effect of depriving an
investor of the use and enjoyment of her investment, even in the absence of a
physical taking”."®° According to the Claimants, this “tracks international law
jurisprudence, which confirms the concepts of ‘creeping’ and ‘indirect’ ‘expropriation,’
prohibiting constituent elements with the cumulative effect of expropriation, even if a
single individual element may not alone rise to the level of being expropriatory”.'8"

155. With reference to President Chavez's 2007 Speech and Ms. Rondon de Sasd’'s
opinion, '®* the Claimants submit that the Royalty Measure, the Extraction Tax and the

Expropriation were all part of a “deliberate [and] coordinated [expropriation]

legislative [...] in respect of [...] the expropriation of the assets of, or a Party's interest in, the Association
[..-] will be considered Discriminatory Actions [...]") (emphasis added).

179 C-PHB, § 90; Manning WS I, CWS-2, § 19.
180 C-PHB, § 91.

181 C-PHB, § 91. The Tribunal notes that, unlike the Petrozuata AA, the Hamaca AA does not incorporate specific
language allowing for a cumulative analysis in order to assess the possible discriminatory nature of qualified
measures (see infra, § 162.v). Conversely, unlike the Hamaca AA, the Petrozuata AA does not explicitly define an
expropriation as a discriminatory qualified measure. In this context, the Tribunal understands that: (i) the
Claimants’ recourse to the term “expropriation” in Article 14.1(b)(1) of the Hamaca AA responds to the assumption
that it permits undertaking a similar global analyisis as Section 1.01 of the Petrozuata AA; and (ii) the international
and domestic law arguments regarding the notion of expropriation are mostly germane to the characterization of a
series of qualified measures as discriminatory under the Hamaca AA, not under the Petrozuata AA.

campaign’”."®° As such, the first two measures “must be considered a constituent part
of the Expropriation”,"®4 and, pursuant to Article 14.1(b)(1), the Overall Expropriation

must be deemed a DA under the Hamaca AA.

156. The Respondents argue in response that the text of the Hamaca AA does not support
the Claimants’ “bizarre interpretation” that Article 14.1(b)(1) allows to characterize the
Overall Expropriation as a DA. First, while Article 14.1(b)(1) lists an “expropriation of
[...] assets [...] or [...] interests” as a potential DA, royalties and taxes are treated
separately.’ Second, construing the term “expropriation” in Article 14.1(b)(1) so as
to include the concepts of indirect and creeping expropriation is incorrect as a matter
of Venezuelan and international law."®°

157. With respect to Venezuelan law, the Respondents first draw a distinction between
“expropriation”, on the one hand, and “contributions, restrictions and obligations”, on
the other.'8” Against this framework, they highlight that, under Article 2 of the 2002
Expropriation Law,'® and pursuant to the approach taken by the Venezuelan
Supreme Court,'89 for an act to be considered expropriatory, it must involve: (i) the
compulsory transfer of ownership or of any other right to the State’s patrimony; (ii) a
final judgment to that effect; and (iii) timely payment of just compensation.

158. The Respondents then argue that measures that do not imply such compulsory
transfer of title, but only specify the scope and duration of such title, are “‘limitations’,
‘contributions’, ‘obligations’ and ‘restrictions’, not expropriations”.'°' On this basis,
alluding to the Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax, they submit that “not every
diminution of property rights, abstractly considered, constitutes an expropriation”.'92

The Respondents concede that measures may be considered “equivalent” in effect to
expropriation. However, referring to the Claimants’ own submissions, the
Respondents emphasize that such equivalence can only be found if the measures at
hand “have the cumulative effect of depriving an investor of the use and enjoyment of
its investment, even in the absence of a physical taking”.°? By contrast, in the
present case “there is no issue of ‘creeping’ or ‘indirect’ expropriation, as the Projects
were formally and directly expropriated; nor is there any argument that the fiscal
measures, either individually or in the aggregate, deprived the investor of the use and
enjoyment of its investment”.194

With reference to Venezuelan Supreme Court decisions,'® the Respondents thus
submit that fiscal measures (such as the Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax)
can only be deemed expropriatory if they constitute a “complete or unreasonable
impairment” that “extinguishes” the taxpayer's patrimony.'°° Accordingly, given that
despite each of the aforesaid qualified measures, the Projects were nonetheless
much more profitable than had been anticipated at their inception,’*” the Claimants’
creeping or indirect expropriation argument (i.e. the Overall Expropriation) is
“laughable”.198

Turning to international law, the Respondents rely on the award rendered in the Mobil
case which, “considering the same fiscal measures that are at issue here”, stated

as follows:

[U]nder international law, a measure which does not have all the features of a
formal expropriation may be equivalent to an expropriation if it gives rise to an
effective deprivation of the investment as a whole. Such a deprivation requires
either a total loss of the investment’s value or a total loss of control by the
investor of its investment, both of a permanent nature.

It is undisputed that those conditions are not fulfilled in the present case with
respect to either [of the Projects]. Accordingly, the pre-migration measures

enumerated by the Claimants cannot be characterized as equivalent to an
expropriation of the Claimants’ investments.2°°

162. Before venturing into the analysis of the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal deems it

important to first make the following preliminary observations:

Similar to the Petrozuata AA,2°' the Hamaca AA defines DA as a qualified
measure which is both: “(ii) unjust and (iii) [as a default comparator] not
generally applicable to entities (both public and private) [...] in the
hydrocarbon industry in Venezuela [(i.e. discriminatory)]”.2°?

Like in the Petrozuata AA,?°> the term “unjust” in Article 14.1(b) of the Hamaca
AA is given content by reference to the definition of MAE (which is equivalent
to SED). Article 14.2(a) thus states that a qualified measure (or a series
thereof) shall be considered “unjust” if it results, “individually or in the
aggregate”, in MAE.?°% No other provision in the Hamaca AA further develops
the “unjust” requirement of Article 14.1(b). Hence, the notion of MAE is not a
distinct component added to the general notion of DA as defined in the
Hamaca AA. Rather, in order to potentially constitute a DA, the qualified

measure in question must be deemed “unjust” as a result of causing MAE.

Also in line with the Petrozuata AA,?°> the comparator for a qualified measure
to be deemed discriminatory varies depending on the type of qualified
measure in question. Article 14.1(b) establishes as its default comparator for
discrimination purposes measures that are “not generally applicable to entities
(both public and private) [...] in the hydrocarbon industry”.2°° Subject to the
specific nature of a given measure, other relevant comparators include
measures that are (i) not “generally applicable to corporations and other legal
entities that are taxable in the same manner as corporations in Venezuela”;?”
(ii) “not generally consistent with internationally recognized transfer pricing

principles for taxation”;2°° and (iii) “in excess of the maximum rate specified by
law for the hydrocarbon industry in general”.2°°

iv. The adequate comparator to assess whether an “expropriation” is
discriminatory is whether it is not “generally applicable to corporations and
other legal entities that are taxable in the same manner as corporations in
Venezuela”.2"° Article 14.1(b)(1) of the Hamaca AA appears to establish this
comparator not only in order to determine if an “expropriation” is
discriminatory, but, more broadly, to determine if a qualified measure is a
DA.2"' Nonetheless, because Article 14.1(b)(1) conditions the characterization
of an “expropriation” as a DA to a particular discriminatory comparator without
excusing an “expropriation” from nonetheless being “unjust” (as defined in
Article 14.2(a)),212 the Tribunal finds that, essentially, Article 14.1(b)(1) only
deals with a potential DA’s discriminatory element.

v. Unlike the Petrozuata AA, the Hamaca AA does not have any explicit
language catering for a cumulative or global analysis at the moment of
assessing the discriminatory nature of a series of qualified measures. Indeed,
it is only Article 14.2(a), dealing with the concept of MAE, which states that for
the effects of discriminatory qualified measures to be unjust, they must
(“individually or in the aggregate”) cause a MAE.?"° For the Tribunal, the
foregoing accommodates the argument that, in the negotiation of the AAs, the
Claimants also wanted to avoid “death by a thousand cuts”.2"4 As seen with
respect to the notion of SED in the Petrozuata AA (and having no reason to
believe that the issue should be any different with respect to the notion of
MAE in the Hamaca AA),?'5 the Claimants’ concern of “death by a thousand
cuts” pertained to the economic consequences of qualified measures—not to
their discriminatory nature. In this context, the Tribunal agrees with the

action with force of law, act of government, or action or decision of any Venezuelan national, state or municipal
legislative [...] in respect of [...] the expropriation of the assets of, or a Party's interest in, the Association or
Association Entities, will be considered Discriminatory Actions if they are not generally applicable to
corporations and other legal entities that are taxable in the same manner as corporations in Venezuela”).

Respondents’ position that, in the event certain qualified measures are
deemed non-discriminatory, they cannot be aggregated in order to prompt the
Respondents to accord compensation for the resulting MAE.2'®

vi. Again similarly to the Petrozuata AA, nothing in the Hamaca AA suggests that
the intent behind a series of qualified measures is relevant for the purposes of
determining whether said measures are either discriminatory or unjust. Thus,
the Tribunal reiterates its view that the Claimants’ reliance on the Chavez's
2007 Speech and Ms. Rondon de Sas6 opinion is, under the Hamaca AA and

its provision on DAs, inapposite.?'”

With the foregoing in mind, the Tribunal notes that the term “expropriation” in Article
14.1(b)(1) is not defined elsewhere in the Hamaca AA. Neither Party has submitted
any evidence as to whether and, if so, why “expropriation” ought to be understood
with due regard to the development of this concept under international (investment)
law. In turn, Article 17.1 explicitly states that the Hamaca AA “shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the law of the Republic of Venezuela”.28 In view of this,
the Tribunal will leave open the relevance of the Parties’ arguments on international
investment law in the present context. Accordingly, insofar as the concept of
“expropriation” is concerned, the Tribunal will primarily consider Venezuelan law. In
any event, as developed further below,?'° the application of international law in the
present context would not lead to a different result.

Precisely because the term “expropriation” is not defined in the Hamaca AA,7”° there
is no contractual basis for construing it (without further reasons) as a taking which
comprises multiple consecutive measures. The Tribunal has considered the
Claimants’ argument that nothing in the negotiating history of the Hamaca AA
precludes that possibility either.2?1 However, such an argument is self-serving. If the
negotiating history is to be considered, the point is not whether it excluded the
Claimants’ purported understanding, but rather whether it can be said to include it. It
is the Claimants that have the burden of proof in substantiating their assertion and
they have failed to do so.

More specifically, the Claimants have not supported their contention that under
Venezuelan law: (i) the Claimants are entitled to compensation for “value-depressing
measures” such as the Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax;?? or that (ii) an
“expropriation can constitute a series of regulatory acts that together have the
cumulative effect of depriving an investor of the use and enjoyment of her investment,
even in the absence of a physical taking”.2°

The Tribunal also finds it telling that the Claimants have not referred to any
Venezuelan statutory provisions or judicial decisions in support of their position.
Instead, the authorities relied upon by the Claimants are all doctrinal writings, which

in any event merely suggest that:

i. Under Venezuelan law, temporary or permanent occupation of residential or
corporative property may amount to expropriation of that property if the
proprietors are precluded from the “use, enjoy[ment] or convey[ance]” of their
property.274 Yet, such a view, closely related to the notion of indirect
expropriation, is irrelevant to the case at hand. As is indeed evident, the
Expropriation in the present case constitutes a classic example of direct
expropriation. Moreover, it cannot be seriously suggested that the Royalty
Measure and the Extraction Tax (individually or in the aggregate) could be
equated with either a temporal or permanent: (i) occupation of the Projects;
and/or (ii) deprivation of the Claimants’ shareholder rights in the Projects.

ii. Depending on the circumstances, regulatory acts adopted by Venezuela could
potentially be tantamount to expropriation in the context of international
investment law, such as under Bilateral Investment Treaties concluded by
Venezuela.”*5 While this is generally uncontroversial, it is not clear how it is

relevant to the present case.

Overall, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have not rebutted the Respondents’
arguments that: (i) the Projects were formally and directly expropriated by way of the
Expropriation, rather than through a series of qualified measures whose cumulative
effects were equivalent to a physical taking (i.e. indirect or creeping expropriation);

169.

and (ii) neither the Royalty Measure nor the Extraction Tax, individually or in the
aggregate, precluded the Claimants from operating the Projects pursuant to the
AAs.226

In other words, the Claimants have failed to justify the proposition that, under
Venezuelan law: (i) an uncontested direct “expropriation” (such as the Expropriation)
should somehow account for preceding non-expropriatory qualified measures; (ii) the
Expropriation ex post facto transforms the Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax
into constitutive elements of a progressive “expropriation” culminating with the
Expropriation (i.e. the Claimants’ Overall Expropriation DA claim); or (iii) conversely,
that the Expropriation, despite being an outright “expropriation”, should be deemed
nothing more than one constitutive element of the Overall Expropriation.

Indeed, it appears that the Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax are nothing more
than “limitations”, “contributions”, “obligations”, and/or “restrictions” in relation to
property.22” As explained by the Respondents’ legal expert, Prof. Garcia Montoya,
these concepts are well established in Venezuelan law and suggest that the very
notion of property rights presupposes the imposition of certain burdens on the title
holder.228 In fact, in a publication pre-dating the current Venezuelan Constitution,
Prof. Brewer-Carias, one of the Claimants’ legal experts, had also adopted the view
that property rights are not unfettered under Venezuelan law.?29 According to Prof.
Garcia Montoya, this is particularly the case when the impact on the property right
stems from the State’s prerogative to adopt fiscal measures, as long as the exercise
of such power does not result in the confiscation of the right in question.?°° In this
context, the Tribunal notes in passing that the safeguard against confiscatory taxation
is to be found in Article 317 of the Venezuelan Constitution,2°' not in Article 115,

which grants the right to property and conditions expropriation to “reasons of public

utility or social interest, by final judgment and timely payment of just

compensation”.252

The Claimants do not openly contest the Respondents’ characterization of the
Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax as ab initio limitations on property rights.
Indeed, given the concession made by Mr. Heinrich that, before the Expropriation, the
Claimants’ profits had exceeded their initial expectations despite the adoption of the
Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax, an argument to the contrary would be
unfathomable.2° Instead, the Claimants briefly argue that the Respondents’
distinction between “expropriation”, on the one hand, and “contributions, restrictions
and obligations”, on the other, “miss[es] the point”.2°4 According to the Claimants, this
is so because they “do not and have never argued that the individual fiscal measures
were expropriatory by themselves [but] that the measures together formed part of one
campaign of expropriation. And [...] Venezuelan law [...] recognize[s] that the
concept of expropriation may take such connected measures into account”.235

However, as already explained above, the Claimants have not demonstrated that
Venezuelan law lends support to their position. In particular, the Claimants have not
demonstrated: (i) why, under Venezuelan law, the Royalty Measure and the
Extraction Tax should loose their status as mere limitations to property with the
issuance of the Expropriation; and (ii) why, in light of the Expropriation, the Royalty
Measure and the Extraction Tax should be deemed an “expropriation” under
Venezuelan law despite the fact that the protection against confiscatory taxation has
a distinct legal basis.?5° Put simply, the Claimants have failed to establish that the
Overall Expropriation constitutes an “expropriation” in accordance with Article

14.1(b)(1) of the Hamaca AA or, more generally, under Venezuelan law.

The Tribunal’s conclusion is no different even after considering the Parties’
arguments on international (investment) law. With reference to Crystallex®°” and

expropriation, “international law jurisprudence” prohibits “constituent elements with
the cumulative effect of expropriation, even if a single individual element may not
alone rise to the level of being expropriatory”.*°9 The Claimants are right. In both
Crystallex and Phillips it was held that expropriation may be attained through the
adoption of a series of non-expropriatory measures whose effect is, retrospectively
and in the aggregate, expropriatory.4° However, despite putting forward a legally
correct conclusion, the precedential value that the Claimants seek to derive from
these two cases is besides the point.

Creeping and indirect expropriation are well established concepts in international
(investment) law. Further one may leave aside for the sake of reasoning whether
these concepts would apply (and under what kind of adjustments) in a contractual
context. However, neither Crystallex nor Phillips dealt with a series of non-
expropriatory measures culminating with one clear and outright formal direct
expropriation, as in the case at hand. As argued by the Respondents, “there is no
issue of ‘creeping’ or ‘indirect’ expropriation [in the present case], as the Projects
were formally and directly expropriated; nor is there any argument that the fiscal
measures, either individually or in the aggregate, deprived the investor of the use and
enjoyment of its investment”.2*' Differently stated, it was the Expropriation, not the
Royalty Increase or the Extraction Tax, which deprived the Claimants of their
investment in Venezuela. As such, only the Expropriation could ultimately be deemed
contrary to international law under the generally recognized standard protecting
foreign investors against unlawful expropriation. Because the Expropriation can be
characterized as an independent wrongful act, the Royalty Increase and the
Extraction Tax, together with the Expropriation, are precluded from giving rise to one
composite wrongful act under the same standard.

In any event, as argued by the Respondents, “it is actually quite elementary under
international law that a fiscal measure or even a series of fiscal measures cannot be

considered expropriatory unless they virtually bankrupt the company, and it is

239 Reply, § 276; C-PHB, § 91. The Claimants also refer to the writings of Reisman and Sloane to support their
conclusion. See W. Michael Reisman and Robert D. Sloane, INDIRECT EXPROPRIATION AND ITS VALUATION IN THE BIT
GENERATION, FACULTY SCHOLARSHIP SERIES (2004), CLA-88, pp. 123-124 (“Discrete acts, analyzed in isolation
rather than in the context of the overall flow of events, may, whether legal or not in themselves, seem innocuous
vis-a-vis a potential expropriation. Some may not be expropriatory in themselves. Only in retrospect will it become
evident that those acts comprised part of an accretion of deleterious acts and omissions, which in the aggregate
expropriated the foreign investor's property rights.”).

undisputed that the 2004 Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax did not come close
to that”.242

In sum, the Claimants’ argument that the Overall Expropriation ought to be
considered as an “expropriation” pursuant to Article 14.1(b)(1) of the Hamaca AA,
fails both under Venezuelan and international law.

The foregoing is dispositive of the issue in favor of the Respondents. Nevertheless,
for the sake of completeness the Tribunal will also address the Respondents’
argument that the Hamaca AA deals separately with the notions of “expropriation”
and “royalties”; an argument which further reinforces the Tribunal’s decision on this
point.243

Despite being labelled an Extraction Tax, it is common ground between the Parties
that the Extraction Tax increased the royalty rate on crude oil to 33.33% (which had
already been increased by the Royalty Measure from 1% to the 16.66% contemplated
in Article 41 of the 1943 Hydrocarbons Law).?“ In fact, the Tribunal notes that, rather
than using the term “royalty” per se, Article 41 of the 1943 Hydrocarbons Law has all
along referred to an “exploitation tax”. Further, as recognized by Mr. Heinrich at the
Hearing, the Extraction Tax was calculated in the same way as the royalty and could
be even understood as a “Royalty Tax Number 2”.245 Moreover, the Parties’ counsel
have both referred to the Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax, jointly, as “royalty

Measures”.46

With this in mind, it is important to recall that Article 14.1(b)(4) of the Hamaca AA
states that “increases in the royalty rate applicable to the crude oil produced by the
Parties” will not be considered discriminatory “unless such changes result in a royalty
rate [...] in excess of the maximum rate specified by law for the hydrocarbon industry
in general”.247 It is also noteworthy that the material royalty increase to 33.33%

(resulting from the cumulative application of the Royalty Measure and the Extraction
Tax) was assumed by all private hydrocarbon operators, PDVSA, and all other
government owned oil companies.”* Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot accept the
proposition that the Overall Expropriation constitutes a discriminatory qualified
measure under the Hamaca AA, when two of its constituent elements (i.e. the Royalty
Measure and the Extraction Tax) cannot be qualified as discriminatory in the first
place.

In general, the Claimants have been unable to overcome the hurdle that their Overall
Expropriation DA claim comprises a Royalty Measure and an Extraction Tax which: (i)
the Claimants themselves admit do not constitute DAs on a stand alone-basis;249 and
(ii) the effects of which, if assessed against the default comparator in the Hamaca AA
for discrimination purposes,?°° rather than against the standard set out in Article
14.1(b)(4) excluding royalty increases from being deemed discriminatory,7°' would be
“generally applicable to entities (both public and private) [...] in the hydrocarbon
industry” .252

Therefore, the Tribunal finds it incoherent to argue that, because of the Expropriation,
the comparator for assessing the discriminatory nature of either the Royalty Measure
and/or the Extraction Tax should vary. The DA provisions of the Hamaca AA do not
withstand such an interpretation.

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal determines that the Overall Expropriation
does not constitute an “expropriation” pursuant to Article 14.1(b)(1) of the Hamaca
AA. As such, the Overall Expropriation is not discriminatory under the Hamaca AA. By
the same token, the Royalty Measure and/or the Extraction Tax are not discriminatory
under the Hamaca AA either.

In light of all of the above analysis of each AA, the Tribunal concludes that only the
Expropriation constitutes a discriminatory measure under both the Petrozuata and
Hamaca AAs. Conversely, the remaining constitutive elements of the Overall
Expropriation, namely, the Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax, cannot be
deemed discriminatory under either the Petrozuata or the Hamaca AAs. Therefore,

given that the discriminatory nature of a qualified measure is essential in order for it to
be characterized as a DA, the Royalty Measure, the Extraction Tax and the Overall
Expropriation do not constitute DAs under either AA.

First prong for a qualified measure to be deemed a DA: the alleged
discriminatory nature of the Income Tax Increase

The Claimants submit that, in order to determine whether the Income Tax Increase
was discriminatory under the Petrozuata AA, the standard or comparator to be
applied is whether this qualified measure was “generally applicable to most
enterprises in Venezuela”.25° With respect to the Hamaca AA, the Claimants submit
that the adequate comparator must be whether the Income Tax Increase was
“generally applicable to corporations and other legal entities that are taxable in the
same manner as corporations in Venezuela”. In essence, the Claimants argue that
“both AAs provide that a tax measure is discriminatory if it is not generally applicable

to all corporations in Venezuela”.255

On this basis, the Claimants stress that, due to the Income Tax Increase, the income
tax payable by corporations pertaining to the hydrocarbon industry or related ventures
(including the EHCO projects) was raised from 34% to 50%. In contrast, all other
corporations in Venezuela continued to pay income tax at the rate of 34%.75°
Therefore, the Income Tax Increase must be deemed discriminatory.

It has been the Respondents’ position throughout the proceedings that the alleged
discriminatory nature of the Income Tax Increase hinges on what institutes a
“generally applicable” tax.25’ In the Respondents’ own terms, the issue to be
considered by the Tribunal runs as follows:

If the [Income Tax Increase was] generally applicable because [it] applied to

any taxpayer engaging in the oil business, then [it] cannot be [discriminatory]. If

“generally applicable” means that the 50% rate had to apply to all enterprises,

regardless of whether they were engaged in the oil business, then the [Income
Tax Increase] would fall within the definition [of discriminatory].25*

186. In this regard, the Respondents argue that the first of the previous two possible
interpretations is to be preferred.”°° Bearing in mind that the Income Tax Increase
was indeed applicable to all enterprises engaged in the oil business, in the
Respondents’ view it follows that it was not discriminatory and thus cannot be
characterized as a DA.

187. The Tribunal finds the Respondents’ conclusion unsubstantiated. Overall, the DA
provisions of both AAs are complicated and heavily conditioned upon multiple layers
of carve-outs, exceptions, and counter-exceptions. That being said, in the context of
income tax, the specific passages of the DA provisions invoked by the Claimants (the
relevance of which has not been contested by the Respondents) are clear. Thus, the
interpretation offered by the Respondents simply does not play out against the text of
either AA.

188. In the Petrozuata AA, the default comparator to assess discrimination is established
in the chapeau of the definition of DAs. It refers to qualified measures whose
“treatment” is “not applicable to all enterprises in Venezuela’.2©° Then, the same
provision lays out a first carve-out to the foregoing default comparator. In particular, it
stipulates that “treatment shall not be considered discriminatory if it equally applies to
the enterprises (empresas) within the oil industry in Venezuela”.*°' Subsequently, a
first exception to the preceding carve-out is provided. In unmistakably clear terms, the
said exception clarifies that, “with respect to the application of income taxes and any
valuations as a basis for income taxes (e.g. the Fiscal Export Value), treatment shall
be considered discriminatory if it is not generally applicable to most enterprises
in Venezuela”.*? Put simply, by way of the income-tax-exception to the carve-out,
the default comparator established in the chapeau is, in essence, again rendered
applicable.

282 Petrozuata AA, C-1, Section 1.01(a)(1) (emphasis added).

263 As seen supra at § IlI.B..4.a.i, Sein 1.01(a)(3) of the Petrozuata AA states that, under certain
circ Ices, qualified may be y despite being equally applicable to
enterprises within the Venezuelan oil industry, This is so if, “analyz[ed] globally”, it can be ascertained that the
measures result in an “economic damage’ that: (i) was not “actually suffered” by government owned companies in
the oil sector; or (ii) was “disproportionally onerous” to the private party “as compared” to government owned
companies in the oil sector (supra, §§ 141-142). As such, Section 1.01(a)(3) of the Petrozuata AA provides for
two different comparators that serve as a second exception to the carve-out in Section 1.01(a), according to which
“treatment shall not be considered discriminatory if it equally applies to the enterprises (empresas) within the oil
industry in Venezuela” (supra, fn. 261). That being said, the Tribunal notes that the Parties have not advanced
their arguments with respect to the Income Tax Increase on the basis of Section 1.01(a)(3) of the Petrozuata AA,

94

189.

190.

191.

The Hamaca AA follows a similar structure. The relevant provision therein fixes as a

default comparator for discrimination purposes those qualified measures “not
generally applicable to entities (both public and private) [...] in the hydrocarbon
industry in Venezuela”.2* Subsequently, the same provision caters for multiple
exceptions, the first of which, as the Claimants point out, refers to “tax rates”. More
specifically, the exception determines that qualified measures “in respect of tax rates”
will not be considered discriminatory if “generally applicable to corporations and other
legal entities that are taxable in the same manner as corporations in Venezuela”.2°
For the Tribunal, it is evident that the reference to “tax rates” in the Hamaca AA

covers, inter alia, income tax variations such as the Income Tax Increase.?6

Two related aspects follow. First, the AAs share common ground: the possible
discriminatory effects of changes to the income tax are addressed by way of an
exception. The Tribunal deems this to be dispositive of the issue in favor of the
Claimants. Had the Parties intended to agree on the interpretation offered by the
Respondents, it is hard to conceive the reasons behind the introduction of such
express exceptions. In the Claimants’ words, the Respondents’ argument regarding
the non-discriminatory nature of the Income Tax Increase “makes no sense, because
if [it] were true, [there] would not be an [income tax] exception” in each AA to begin
with.267 The Tribunal agrees.

Second, in order to accept the Respondents’ interpretation, the Tribunal would
essentially be required to give effect to distinct contractual provisions. Indeed,
understanding the term “generally applicable” as meaning “[applicable] to any
taxpayer engaging in the oil business”,26® suggests that the content of “generally
applicable” would be undistinguishable from: (i) “[applicable] to the enterprises
(empresas) within the oil industry in Venezuela”, as in Section 1.01(a) of the
Petrozuata AA (i.e. the first carve-out to the default comparator);?°° and (ii) “applicable

 

and rightly so: Section 1.01(a)(1) of the Petrozuata AA establishes a specific comparator in order to assess
whether a taxation measure such as the Income Tax Increase is discriminatory or not (supra, fn. 262). Therefore,
it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to assess the alleged discriminatory nature of the Income Tax Increase against
Section 1.01(a)(3).

264 Hamaca AA, C-3, Article 14.1(b).
265 Hamaca AA, C-3, Article 14.1(b)(1).

266 Although not alluded to by the Claimants, the Tribunal cannot help but note that a second exception to the
general comparator in Article 14.1(b) expressly refers to income taxes. Indeed, Article 14.1(b)(3) fixes the same
comparator as Article 14.1(b)(1) with respect to income tax regimes (Hamaca AA, C-3, Article 14.1(b)(3)).

to entities (both public and private) [...] in the hydrocarbon industry in Venezuela’, as
in Article 14.1(b) of the Hamaca AA (i.e. the exception to the default comparator).2”°

Such a construction, however, does not withstand scrutiny. Being an essential part of
the income-tax-exception found in both AAs, it cannot be that the term “generally
applicable” is construed in the same fashion as the comparator from which the said
exception seeks to depart from. Put differently, it would be absurd and nonsensical to
accept that a rule and its exception have the same effect.

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal determines that the Income Tax Increase
is discriminatory both under the Petrozuata and the Hamaca AAs.

Second prong for a qualified measure to be deemed a DA: the alleged unjust
character of the Income Tax Increase and/or of the Expropriation

The Petrozuata AA states that, for the purpose of the definition of DAs, treatment
accorded by a qualified measure shall be considered “unjust” if it results in SED.27' In
tandem, the Hamaca AA states that a qualified measure shall be deemed “unjust” if it
results in MAE.272

The Tribunal has found that neither the Royalty Measure nor the Extraction Tax (and
therefore, the Overall Expropriation as advanced by the Claimants to the extent that it
represents the amalgation of these measures) can be deemed discriminatory under
either the Petrozuata or the Hamaca AAs. Because DAs under each AA must be both
“discriminatory” and “unjust”, the Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax cannot be
characterized as DAs. Hence, the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to assess whether
they are “unjust” as defined in each AA. Accordingly, the Tribunal will only ascertain
whether the Income Tax Increase and the Expropriation are “unjust” for causing SED
and/or MAE. In doing so, the Tribunal bears in mind that the Respondents admit that

the Expropriation constitutes a DA.2”3

Transcript, R-186, Day 2, 457: 20-21.

96

196. The Tribunal first recalls that the harm resulting from measures that qualify as
discriminatory can be cumulatively assessed in order to determine whether SED or
MAE has been caused. This is not controversial between the Parties.274

197. In accordance with Section 1.01 of the Petrozuata AA, SED is caused when, as a
result of discriminatory measures, the Claimants suffer in any given fiscal year a
minimum damage of USD 6.5 million.2’”5 In turn, pursuant to Article 14.2(a) of the
Hamaca AA, MAE exists when discriminatory measures cause a reduction of at least
5% in the Claimants’ net cash flow in any given year.276

198. In light of the foregoing, the Respondents’ own quantum scenarios suggest that,
should the Claimants prevail on the merits of their DA claim, the potential damage
suffered by the Claimants has exceeded the thresholds necessary to establish SED
or MAE.

199. Indeed, according to one of the valuation scenarios put forward by the
Respondents,?”’ the Claimants would be due USD 47.8 million under the Petrozuata
AA and USD 59.5 million under the Hamaca AA for their DA claims.2’6 It is worth
noting that the foregoing scenario assumes that the Expropriation is the only
discriminatory qualified measure at issue. It thus shows that the effects of the
Expropriation alone were deemed sufficient to surpass the de minimis threshold
required to cause both SED and MAE.?79

200. It follows that factoring-in the effects of the Income Tax Increase can only further raise
the margin between the de minimis threshold and the actual harm suffered. Indeed,

with the same assumptions of the Respondents’ second most favorable valuation

274 Reply, §§ 176-177; Rejoinder, §§ 303, 316-321; supra, §§ 126, 145, 162.ii, 162.v.
278 Supra, § 101.
276 Supra, § 107.

277 The Respondents essentially advance two valuation scenarios. The first one assumes the dismissal of the
Claimants’ DA claims in their entirety due to the latter’s alleged non-compliance with the requirements of notice
and exhaustion of local remedies of each AA. The second one (referenced herein) regards the Expropriation to be
the only DA in place (i.e. it does not account for the Income Tax Increase) and rejects all of the Claimants’
additional quantum assumptions (R-PHB, §§ 895-897). Yet it accepts to different degrees the Claimants’ position
on the notification and exhaustion of local remedies. The Respondents’ position on the alleged notification and
exhaustion of local remedies will be examined further below (infra, §§ 202 ss, 259 ss). These arguments,
however, pertain solely to the issue of whether there is a duty to compensate for the SED/MAE suffered by the
Claimants. It is not germane to the question of whether SED/MAE has been caused as a result of discriminatory
qualified actions. Therefore, the Respondents’ position regarding notice and exhaustion of local remedies is not
relevant for assesing whether DAs exist or not.

278 R-PHB, § 895.

279 In any event, the amount awarded to the Claimants in consideration of the position of both Parties clearly
demonstrates that the threshold required by both AA for the existence of SED or MAE has been satisfafied (infra,
§§ 543, 1127, 1163).

scenario (yet accounting for the Income Tax Increase as an additional discriminatory
measure),”°° in principle the Claimants would be owed USD 68.6 million under the
Petrozuata AA and USD 76 million under the Hamaca AA.751

For these reasons, the Expropriation and the Income Tax Increase both constitute
discriminatory qualified measures that give rise to SED and MAE. Put simply, both the
Expropriation and the Income Tax Increase are DAs under the Petrozuata and the
Hamaca AAs.

The alleged notification requirements

The Respondents argue that the AAs contain notice requirements applicable to all
claims for compensation based on the occurrence of a DA. In this regard, the
Respondents point to Section 9.07(e) of the Petrozuata AA, which states:

The right to compensation of [CPZ] under this Section 9.07 shall be limited to
those damages actually suffered by such Shareholder beginning with the fiscal
year previous to the year in which a written notice is sent to [PDVSA Petrdleo],
indicating that the notifying Shareholder considers that a Discriminatory Action
has taken place.782
By the same token, the Respondents refer to Articles 14.3(a) and 14.3(b) of the
Hamaca AA which, in their view, requires the following two separate notices as

“preconditions to obtaining” compensation for the harm caused by a DA:

[Flirst, a “Notice of Discriminatory Action,” set forth in Section 14.3(a), to be

given “promptly” after the injured party “considers that a Discriminatory Action

has occurred”; and second, a “Notice of Triggering Event,” set forth in Section

14.3(b), to be sent in the event that the party determines that the Discriminatory

Action caused a “Significant Adverse Effect.285
The Respondents argue that the Claimants have not met any of the requirements
contained in these two provisions. The Respondents are “fully aware” that the
Claimants indeed objected to the application of the Royalty Measure, the Extraction
Tax, the Income Increase and the Expropriation.284 However, according to the
Respondents, both the Petrozuata and Hamaca AAs specifically required notice to
PDVSA’s subsi

“nowhere in any of the Claimants’ ‘numerous letters’ do the words ‘Discriminatory
Action’ ever appear”.285 Hence, the Claimants’ general objections say “nothing about
whether the Claimants provided the requisite notices of “Discriminatory Actions”. [...]
The requirements of the Associations Agreements are not satisfied by either
awareness of objections to a governmental measure or by documents that are plainly
not notices of the occurrence of a ‘Discriminatory Action’, and combining both does
not change that fact”.26°

The Respondents describe the consequences of the Claimants’ omission as follows:

In the case of the Petrozuata Association Agreement, the legal consequences
are spelled out in the Compensation Provisions themselves — no compensation
is payable in respect of any fiscal year prior to the year in which notice of a
Discriminatory Petrozuata Action is given. In the case of the Hamaca
Association Agreement, the legal consequence of a failure to give the required
notices is provided by the applicable law — forfeiture (or caducidad) of the right
to obtain compensation.?8”
The Respondents therefore submit that, since no “notice of Discriminatory Action”
was ever provided by the Claimants to any of PDVSA’s subsidiaries, the Claimants

“are prevented from [receiving compensation for] their untimely [DA] claims”.28°

The Claimants submit, on the other hand, that the Respondents’ position is “purely
formal in nature”.28° According to the Claimants, “nothing in the AAs or in Venezuelan
law requires the recitation of talismanic words”.2°° Rather, the underlying purpose of
the notification requirement in the AAs was to “alert” Respondents to the complained-
of actions taken by the Government.?9' In this regard, the Claimants note that the
Respondents acknowledge the Claimants’ objections to the various qualified
measures adopted by Venezuela.” Therefore, “there can be no question that the
Respondents were fairly put on notice of their obligations under AAs, including their
indemnity obligations under the DA provisions”. Put simply, the Respondents and
the Venezuelan Government were “fully aware” of the qualified measures questioned

by the Claimants and their effect on the AAs.7°4 Consequently, it must be understood
that the Claimants properly discharged any notice requirement in the AAs.2°>

In any event, the Claimants argue that any additional or more specific notifications by
the Claimants would have been futile — futility being a principle recognized by
Venezuelan law.?° This is so because the notification requirements in the AAs were
not only intended to inform the Respondents of the existence of a contested qualified
measure, but they also sought to “ensure” that the Respondents had the “opportunity
to act to remedy them”.2°” However, the Claimants had no reason to believe that the
Respondents could or would act independently to assist in opposing the qualified
measures objected by the Claimants. In this context, “issuing further notices under
the AAs using different formulations would have served no purpose”.2%® This is
particularly the case given that PDVSA was aware of its obligation under the AAs “to
pay compensation” to the Claimants pursuant to the “contractual indemnities”
contained therein.299

The issue therefore boils down to three issues. First, whether the AAs required the
Claimants to provide notice to the Respondents should the former consider that a DA
had taken place. Second, whether such a requirement (if extant) was complied with
by the Claimants. Third, in case of non-compliance, whether the Claimants are now
precluded from seeking compensation for any SED or MAE caused by a qualified
measure deemed a DA.

i. Did the AAs require the Claimants to provide notice to the Respondents?

Before venturing into the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal recalls that only the Income
Tax Increase and the Expropriation have been deemed DAs. Consequently, the
Tribunal will only assess whether the Claimants discharged any alleged notice
requirement vis-a-vis these two measures. Conversely, the Royalty Increase and/or
the Extraction Tax will not be part of the Tribunal’s analysis.

With this in mind, the Tribunal considers that the first issue, namely, whether the AAs
required the Claimants to notify the Respondents should they consider that a DA had

taken place, must be resolved in the affirmative. The AAs are clear. In accordance
with Section 9.07(e) of the Petrozuata AA, the Claimants were expected to “indicat[e]”
that a “Discriminatory Action [had] taken place”. In turn, further to Article 14.3(a) of
the Hamaca AA, Claimants were to give a “Notice of Discriminatory Action”
“indicat[ing]’ whether they “believ[ed] that such a Discriminatory Action will result in a
Material Adverse Effect”.°°' Moreover, pursuant to Article 14.3(b) of the Hamaca AA,
the Claimants were “entitled to give a [...] Notice of Triggering Event” in case they
believed that they “[had already] suffered a Material Adverse Effect [...] as a result of
actions in respect of which [they] had delivered Notices of Discriminatory Action” .°°?

Indeed, the existence as such of the notice requirement does not appear to be
contentious. Rather, the Claimants submit that they discharged any notice
requirement under the AA.°° Alternatively, they argue that strict compliance with such
a requirement would have been futile.°°* However, as far as the text of the AAs is
concerned, at no point have the Claimants argued that the AAs did not contain a
notice requirement and rightfully so.

ji. Have the Claimants complied with the notice requirement?

The second issue, namely, whether the Claimants complied with the AAs’ notice
requirement, is less straightforward. It is common ground between the Parties that the
Claimants issued several communications objecting to the applicability of the Income
Tax Increase and the Expropriation.° The pivotal question is therefore whether such
objections are sufficient to satisfy the notice requirement under the AAs by alerting
the Respondents to the Claimants’ belief that the qualified measures at issue
constituted DAs. The Tribunal will discuss the said objections in turn.

With respect to the Income Tax Increase, the Tribunal has found the following facts to
be of particular relevance:

i. On 29 November 2006, the Claimants sent a letter to Mr. Mommer and the
representatives of all three Respondents. In this correspondence, the
Claimants “protest[ed]” about the “recent changes made to the fiscal regime

216.

applicable to the investments made by [the Claimants] within the territory of
[Venezuela]’. The letter makes reference to, inter alia, the “increased income
tax from 34% to 50%”, and “reserved all of its rights under Venezuelan and
International Law with respect to such changes”.2°6

ii. On 31 January 2007, copying Dr. Mommer (in his capacity of Vice Minister of
Hydrocarbons), the Claimants sent a letter to Mr. Ramirez (in his capacity of
Minister of Energy), President Maduro (in his then capacity of Minister of
Foreign Affairs), and Ms. Gladis Gutiérrez (in her capacity of Attorney
General). In their letter the Claimants refer to, inter alia, the Income Tax
Increase, deeming it “without basis and inconsistent with the Association
Agreements”. The letter goes on to question President Chavez's
announcement of his intention to expropriate the Claimants’ investments in
Venezuela. The letter concludes by considering “Venezuela’s actions” as
“contrary to the protections afforded to ConocoPhillips under the [Venezuela-
Netherlands BIT], as well as the Foreign Investment Law”, and therefore
“notifies Venezuela in writing of the existence of a dispute in accordance with
the provisions of the [latter two instruments]”.5°”

As far as the Expropriation is concerned, the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to refer to
each communication in detail. Suffice it to note that in practically all the objections
raised from 26 February 2007 to 30 April 2007, the Claimants referred to the
Expropriation and reserved their rights to take legal action pursuant to the AAs,
Venezuela's Investment Law, the Venezuela-Netherlands BIT and/or international

law.308

Having reviewed the record, the Tribunal finds truth in the Respondents’ observation
that none of the communications relied upon by the Claimants explicitly referred to
the occurrence of a DA.°° Indeed, the term Discriminatory Action, or for that matter,
the notions of “discriminatory” or “unjust”, are conspicuously absent in any such
communication. Nonetheless, it would be excessively formalistic for the foregoing to
be dispositive of the issue in favor of the Respondents.

The Respondents refer to Article 1264 VCC in order to argue that, as far as the notice
requirement is concerned, the Parties cannot be allowed to depart from the literal
tenor of the AAs.3"° The Tribunal is aware that, in accordance with Article 1264 of the
VCC, “[o]bligations must be complied with exactly as they have been prescribed”.31"
Nevertheless, immediately thereafter Article 1264 of the VCC states that “[t]he debtor
is liable for damages, in case of breach”.°? This last tranche of Article 1264 VCC
leads the Tribunal to believe that its content is applicable to obligations of a
substantive nature (as opposed to a mere duty or an “obligation” of a different
nature). Indeed, the lack of strict compliance with substantive contractual obligations
should usually result in damages to the creditor of the obligation at issue. Evidently,
however, Section 9.07(e) of the Petrozuata AA and Articles 14.3(a) and 14.3(b) of the
Hamaca AA cannot be characterized as encompassing substantial obligations.

First, in and of themselves these provisions do not establish a relationship between
creditor and debtor. Second, their non-compliance by the Claimants cannot cause
harm to the Respondents for which they could seek compensation. Put differently,
non-compliance with the notice provisions in the AAs do not amount to a
compensable breach of contract: the Respondents seek a different remedy, namely,
the non-applicability of contractual rights—not a breach of the AAs.

The notice provisions in the AAs simply cater to a procedural requirement for the
Claimants to secure an entitlement granted by contract: indemnity for the issuance of
qualified measures constituting DAs. Accordingly, the Tribunal is of the view that the
stringent standard put forward by Article 1264 VCC is non-controlling. Rather, the
Tribunal considers that the issue of whether the Claimants have met the notice
requirements of the AAs must be assessed in light of the purpose of agreeing to such

provisions.

In this respect, the Claimants submit that the purpose underlying the notice
requirements was twofold. First, to “alert Respondents to the complained-of actions
by the Government”.°'? Second, “ensure that Respondents had the opportunity to act
to remedy [the said complained-of actions]”.*‘* These explanations are unpersuasive.

Both Mr. van Wageningen and Mr. Manning, the Claimants’ witnesses, have offered
testimony to the effect that the notice requirements were incorporated into the AAs in

order to “cure” the Respondents’ “ignorance, if any”, vis-a-vis the existence of
qualified measures contested by the Claimants.*"® However, as defined in Section
1.01 of the Petrozuata AA and Article 14.1(b) of the Hamaca AA, measures prima
facie falling under the purview of the relevant DA provision of both AAs included:
“actions”, “decisions”, or “changes in law’, adopted by “any Venezuelan national,
state or municipal legislative or administrative authority (including any such action or
decision resulting in a change in interpretation or application of Venezuelan law)”.2'¢

By definition, these measures are public.

Presumably then, sophisticated as they are, the Parties would (or should) be aware of
the passage of a law, of landmark changes in the interpretation or application of the
law, or of the taking of other governmental or administrative actions akin to the
Projects. Mr. van Wageningen himself recognized this point at the Hearing.°"” It is
therefore unlikely that the notice requirements sought to inform the Respondents of
the existence of already evident and public qualified measures—all of which,
arguably, “would affect [the Parties’] interests in the Project[s]”.5'® Overall, the
Tribunal doubts the notice requirements were intended to serve what otherwise
seems to be a self-fulfilling purpose.

The argument that the notice requirements sought to prompt the Respondents into
“remedyling]” the “complained-of actions by the Government” fares no differently.5"9
Having established that the Parties were expected to be aware of the existence of all
qualified measures affecting the Projects, it is a non sequitur to submit that the notice
requirements were adopted for the Respondents to assume a determined course of
action with respect to the said measures. In any event, such an alleged purpose
would be at odds with the text of the AAs.

Section 9.07(e) of the Petrozuata AA is silent as to the events preceding and
following a notice by the Claimants that a DA has taken place. Article 14.3(a) of the
Hamaca AA does state that, further to a Notice of Discriminatory Action, the Parties

were expected to “meet [and] discuss the formal legal remedies [...] appropriate to
reverse or obtain relief from the [...] Discriminatory Action” at issue.52° Nevertheless, it
was the Claimants, “independently”, that were required to “commence” and “pursue
such remedies”.**' The Respondents’ participation in this undertaking was
conditioned to Corpoven Sub’s express “request”.52? Put simply, it was on the
Claimants, not the Respondents, to seek remedy for any harm resulting from a
qualified measure deemed a DA. Moreover, as established elsewhere in this Award,
the Respondents were under no particular obligation to initiate proceedings against
qualified measures affecting the Projects, to oppose them, or to lobby for their non-

adoption, removal or modification.525

The Tribunal is of the view that the issue regarding the purpose of the notice
requirements is simpler. It is reasonable to assume that every governmental or
legislative measure regarding the oil industry would somehow impact the Parties’
interests in each AA. Yet, not every qualified measure germane to the Venezuelan oil
sector brought about the Respondents’ compliance with their contractual indemnity
obligations. Accordingly, the Claimants’ general objections to the applicability of the
Income Tax Increase and the Expropriation are, to some extent, irrelevant in the

present context.

When it comes to the scope of the Respondents’ obligations, they contractually
assumed the commitment to compensate the Claimants for the harm arising out of
DAs, as defined in each AA. As already established, DAs are configured by way of
the effects caused to the Claimants.°”4 It follows that the Claimants were in the better
position to assess whether the harm suffered from a qualified measure amounted to
discriminatory and unjust treatment (i.e. the two constitute elements of DAs).
Accordingly, the information provided by the Claimants to the Respondents was in
principle necessary for the Respondents to be mindful, not of the existence of a
determined qualified measure, but of how the impact of the said measure triggered
their contractual obligations under the DA provisions of each AA. In this context, the

Claimants’ duty (by way of a specific notice) to “indicate” their “believe” that a DA had
taken place,° gains significance.

The obvious flip-side is the following: were it to be established that the Respondents
were cognizant that a particular qualified measure triggered their indemnity
obligations, then any information that the Claimants may have provided (by way of
notice or otherwise) would have been unnecessary.

The Tribunal’s view does not build-up on the notion of futility. As discussed below, the
Claimants’ arguments on futility are immaterial.5° Rather, the Tribunal is of the
opinion that, upon the Respondents’ awareness to discharge their indemnity
obligations, the purpose of the notice requirements must be deemed fulfilled.

Indeed, it may be the case that the Respondents’ awareness of a DA would have
been primarily prompted by a notice served by the Claimants. However, that should
not be taken as precluding the possibility that the necessary information to that effect
could have also been attained by other means. In fact, the content of a particular
qualified measure in question could be sufficient: for instance, the treatment accorded
by a measure could be so blatantly discriminatory and unjust (as defined in each AA),
that its characterization as a DA would be a foregone conclusion.

This appears to be the case of the Expropriation. By and large, the Expropriation is
the quintessential DA under either AA. It was only applicable to private corporations
in the oil industry. Further, given the magnitude and expected duration of the
Projects, it is evident that its application caused SED/MAE to the Claimants. It is thus
unsurprising that the Respondents were fully aware, not only of the Expropriation’s
existence as a qualified measure, but of their indemnity obligations with regards to it
pursuant to the DA provisions. As explained by Mr. Mommer during the Hearing:

Q. Now, you've testified in the ICSID proceedings that your role in administering
the migration process involved participating in meetings with the Claimants
relation to compensation for the forced nationalization; yes?

A. For forced migration, yes. | participated in quite a few meetings, but not in all
of them; but in important meetings | participated at that time.

Q. And you may recall, Dr. Mommer, that, when you testified here in August,
you testified that Mr. Del Pino of PdVSA also participated actively in those
meetings; yes?

28 Supra, § 211.
326 Infra, §§ 238-241.

106

231.

232.

233.

A. Of course. It was to them to take over the operations so they had to be there,
and it was--yes. Yes. That was it, yes.

Q. And you remember describing yourself and Mr. Del Pino working as a team
in these discussions?

A. We worked as a team, indeed. He had his role to play, and | had my role to
play.

Q. And you described him having a particular role in the compensation
calculations that were being developed in relation to the nationalization;
yes?

A. Given the Association Agreements, PdV was heavily involved in the
compensation discussion. They were obliged by the Agreements to pay
compensation in the first place, so logically they were not out of this
discussion. They were part of it.

Q. They were aware that they had this obligation, and, therefore, they
participated in the discussions?

A. They were aware that there were contractual indemnities programmed

up to a certain Threshold Price and so on.52”
In light of the above, the Tribunal has no hesitation to hold that: (i) the purpose of the
notice requirements with respect to the Expropriation was fulfilled; and/or (ii) the
Claimants’ objection to the Expropriation, and the reservations of their right to take
legal action pursuant to, inter alia, the AAs, could hardly acquire another meaning,
exclusively or not, than a reference to the DA provisions.°” Accordingly, the Tribunal
determines that, as far as the Expropriation is concerned, the notice requirements of
the AAs were discharged since the very outset (i.e. the year 2007).

A finding to the contrary would require the Claimants to unreasonably comply with a
formality devoid of all effect. It would counterintuitively call for the Claimants to notify
the Respondents of something that, as the evidence shows, they already knew.
Pretending otherwise is spurious.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the same conclusion cannot be extended to the
Income Tax Increase. First, there is no evidence on the record clearly accounting for
the Respondents’ awareness of the discriminatory and unjust treatment resulting from
the Income Tax Increase. Similarly, there is no document clearly evidencing the
Claimants’ own awareness or belief that the Income Tax Increase constituted a DA.

328 Supra, § 215.

107

234.

235.

236.

This is so despite the Claimants’ general awareness since the very outset that
expropriatory or similar public measures endangering their interest were plausible.57°

Second and more specifically, the Claimants’ letter of 29 November 2006 (a
document analyzed by both Parties) made no reference to the AAs.*°° This letter only
contends that the Income Tax Increase (and the Extraction Tax) negatively affected
their “investments” and “legitimate expectations’. Subsequently, the letter reserves all
rights under “Venezuelan and International law’. These statements are overly broad
and can imply a variety of courses of action, the main one being, as it came to pass,
recourse to investment treaty arbitration.

Third, while the Claimants rightly point out that their letter of 31 January 2007 did
consider the Income Tax Increase to be “without basis and inconsistent with the
[AAs]”,55' such statement was not made in a vacuum. The letter was copied to Mr.
Mommer, and addressed to Mr. Ramirez, President Maduro (in his then capacity of
Minister of Foreign Affairs), and Ms. Gutiérrez, all acting in their capacity as public
Officials to the Venezuelan Government. Further, also referring to the Expropriation,
the letter expressly puts Venezuela on notice of the existence of a dispute in
accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Investment Law and the Venezuela-
Netherlands BIT.332

In this respect, the Tribunal finds it telling that, in their submissions, the Claimants
omitted giving context to their own evidence and, in particular, to their letter of 31
January 2007. It is clear that the aim of this communication was the notification of an
investment treaty dispute between the Claimants and Venezuela. It certainly does not
appear that it intended to notify, indicate, or otherwise inform the Respondents that
the Income Tax Increase was, in the Claimants’ view, a DA. The supervening events,
namely, the filing of the ICSID request for arbitration without resort to the contractual
remedies, are also indices of what the Claimants intended with that communication,
and how the Respondents were to understand it. In light of this context, the fact that
in their communication the Claimants also mentioned, in passing, inconsistency
between the Income Tax Increase and the AAs is therefore of limited relevance for

29 Confidential Offering Circular, 17 June 1997, C-61, p. 38 (“[...] the Project is subject to political, economic and
other uncertainties, including the risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation or nullification of
existing contracts [...] There can be no assurance that future developments in Venezuela will not have a material
adverse effect on the Project's operations and the Company's revenues”)

determining the issues presently at stake. Indeed, as evidenced by the so-called two
categories of claims advanced by the Claimants in this arbitration, on the Claimants’
own case there are various types of conduct that would allegedly be “inconsistent”
with the AAs.There is thus no basis for the Tribunal to construe the statement in the
Claimants’ letter of 31 January 2007 as constituting a notification of the Claimants’
belief that a DA claim has arisen.

Besides the letters of 29 November 2006 and 31 January 2007, the Claimants have
not pointed to any other attempt to inform the Respondents of the discriminatory and
unjust character of the Income Tax Increase. Hence, the Tribunal has come to the
conclusion that it was only with the commencement of this arbitration that the
Respondents gained (in accordance with the purpose of the contractual provisions)
cognizance of the potential characterization of the Income Tax Increase as a DA. In
sum, the notice requirement in the AAs in relation to the Income Tax Increase was
fulfilled in 2014.

The Claimants’ arguments on futility are of no avail to their position on this matter.
The Claimants’ main contention is that the “new PDVSA” showed no reason “to
expect that the Respondents could or would [remedy the situation or] act
independently to assist in opposing [either the Expropriation or the Income Tax
Increase]’.*°3 However, as established: (i) the Respondents were under no particular
obligation to take any steps to that effect;3*4 and (ii) the purpose behind the notice
requirements appears to be informing the Respondents of the possible
characterization of a qualified measure as a DA,**° not curing their ignorance as to
the existence of a qualified measure, or having the Respondents remedy the
complained-of actions by the Government.%3°

Moreover, futility is frequently argued in the commercial context to avoid compliance
with certain procedural requirements intended to amicably settle a dispute before
resolving it through arbitration (i.e. multi-tiered proceedings beginning with
negotiation, mediation, and/or conciliation). If successful, this allows for the dispute to
be resolved or settled at the outset. Save perhaps for a requirement to exhaust local
remedies (discussed below),°°’ it follows that procedural requirements sometimes

334 Supra, fn. 323.

336 Supra, §§ 221-224.
337 Infra, § 259 ss.

241.

242.

serve as a platform for disposing of the issue by way of the parties’ agreement.
Hence, if evident that no such agreement could be attained, then bypassing
procedural requirements precisely aimed at securing said agreement is sensible. In
the present case, however, whether or not a DA is adopted and continues to generate
effects has never been contingent on the Parties’ actions or agreement. This is so
because, strictly speaking, neither Party can issue or adopt a qualified measure as
defined in the Petrozuata and Hamaca AAs.°°8

Once the Claimants had informed the Respondents that a DA may have taken place,
the Parties could have certainly disagreed on whether the qualified measure in
question should be deemed a DA.*°° Nevertheless, unless one assumes that the
Respondents already knew of the discriminatory and unjust nature of a measure, an
appropriate notice is the only means of informing the Respondents of the same (be it
through a separate letter or a RfA). Therefore there is nothing “futile” about issuing
the required notice in the first place.

In any event, the Claimants have failed to establish that “Venezuelan law recognizes
the principle of futility [excusing them] from otherwise applicable contract
provisions”.*#° The only authority invoked by the Claimants to ground their contention
is the ICC Mobil Award.*4' This can hardly be considered sufficient to assert that a

principle of law is extant in a determined domestic jurisdiction.

iii. What are the consequences of the Claimants’ non-compliance with the notice
requirement?

 

The Tribunal turns next to the discussion of the legal consequences, if any, of the
Claimants’ belated compliance with the notice requirement vis-a-vis the Income Tax
Increase. The Respondents’ position on this point varies considerably depending on
whether the issue falls under the Petrozuata AA or the Hamaca AA. For the sake of
consistency, the Tribunal will once more undertake its analysis under each AA

separately.

246.

Section 9.07(e) of the Petrozuata AA clearly states that the Claimants’ “right to
compensation” in a DA claim “shall be limited to those damages actually suffered [...]
beginning with the fiscal year previous to the year in which [the notice requirement is

satisfied]” 342

The Claimants argue that Section 9.07(e) does not “purport to impose a notification
pre-condition for pursuit of a DA indemnification claim”.54* However, the issue is not
whether the Claimants are outright barred from raising a DA claim: they are not.
Section 9.07(e) does not cater to standing or to the possibility of seeking
compensation for the harm suffered as a result of a discriminatory and unjust
qualified measure. That being said, it does limit and/or condition the right to the
compensation sought. In the Respondents’ words, Section 9.07(e) “excludes
compensation for all cash flows lost [as a result of a DA] prior to the year [...] in which
[the AA’s notice requirements are deemed satisfied]’.*44 The Parties’ experts agree
on this point.245

In light of the above, the Tribunal determines that, in accordance with Section 9.07(e),
the Claimants are only entitled to receive compensation under the Petrozuata AA for
the harm caused by: (i) the Expropriation, as from 2007;%° and (ii) the Income Tax
Increase, as from 2013 (i.e. the fiscal year before the initiation of this arbitration).

e Under the Hamaca AA

The Hamaca AA lacks a provision akin to Section 9.07(e) of the Petrozuata AA. Yet,
the Hamaca AA does state that, “[iJn the event that a Foreign Party considers that a
Discriminatory Action has occurred, it promptly shall give notice thereof (a “Notice of
Discriminatory Action”).*4” The Respondents primarily rely on the term “promptly” in
Article 14.3 of the Hamaca AA to argue that, in accordance with Venezuelan law, the
legal consequence for failing to meet the notice requirement is caducidad (forfeiture)
of the entire DA claim.°4®

247. In turn, the Claimants argue that caducidad entails “the entire loss of a right when that
right has not been claimed within a predetermined period of time established by law
or by the parties in their contract.”*4° Thus, the purported failure to comply with the
notice requirements does not result in a forfeiture of their right to assert the DA Claim.
Caducidad is to be “interpreted restrictively and cannot be applied unless the parties
clearly intended this result”. In particular, “parties must clearly define the specific
right that is to be forfeited, the specific conduct whose absence would result in the
forfeiture, and the relevant time period beginning with a specified start time” before
caducidad can occur.**! According to the Claimants, none of these criteria are
satisfied in the instant case. The Tribunal agrees.

248. The Respondents’ legal expert, Prof. Garcia Montoya, states that “Venezuelan
doctrine confirms that it is not necessary to refer specifically to caducidad in a
contract in order for that result to arise”.°52 However, that is not the issue at hand. The
Claimants’ contention is not that caducidad must explicitly appear in the text of a
contract for it to take place. Rather, it is that (in the absence of an express reference
to caducidad) a contract must leave no room for interpretation that the parties
intended for the non-compliance with a requirement to result in the forfeiture of a
right.55 It is in this context that the Claimants submit that a clear indication of the right
to be forfeited, the conduct necessary to avoid forfeiture, and the timeframe to
undertake the necessary conduct, are optimal proxies to assess the parties’
intentions regarding caducidad.** In fact, the doctrinal authorities referred to by Prof.
Garcia Montoya himself appear to generally support the Claimants’ position. For
instance, one recognized authority states:

Caducidad (from the Latin: caducus: that has fallen) means: the forfeiture of an
active subjective situation (of a right, in a broad sense) that occurs due to the
failure to comply with a certain conduct imposed by a norm for the
conservation of that situation when one already enjoys it... . [and that]

Control Estimate exceed the costs and expenses set forth in the Definitive Cost Estimate by more than 8% or, if
mutually acceptable financing is not available, then each Shareholder shall have the option to proceed or
terminate its participation in the Project. Within 40 Business Days after receipt of the Control Estimate, each
Shareholder shail notify the company in writing, with a copy to the other Shareholder, of its decision to proceed
with the Project or to terminate its participation in the Project, unless the Shareholders agree to do otherwise
within this period of time. Failure to so notify shall be deemed an election not to proceed...”) (emphasis added by
the Claimants)

presupposes the non-compliance with a specific conduct provided for
during the precise term fixed by a norm.*°>

[el

As a result, the holder of the right (in the broad sense), whose specified
inactivity in such lapse produces the loss of the enjoyment or the expectation
to take advantage of the established active subjective situation, has an interest .
. . . [not a duty] to comply with the act or to exercise the contemplated act
within the established peremptory term, but merely has the burden (carga) to
do so, but even though he is free to execute such act or exercise such action; if
he does not do so, he will not avoid the caducidad.3°>

249. Another one explains:

Caducidad means the irreparable loss of the right that one had to exercise
an action, or to effectuate any other legal act, because the time available
within which that action could have been brought or that act performed expired
....[C]aducidad . . . may be established not only by law, but also by contract . .
. . Thus, there is caducidad when the exercise of a right or the performance of
an act is dependent on the fact that it be done within a fixed period, in such a
way that, as very well expressed by Count Mirabelli, “the term is so identified
with the right that, the expiration [of the term] produces the extinction of
[the right].°5”

250. A third one states:

5.4.2 Contractually established forfeiture of the action. All of the general terms
of guaranties (fianzas) establish in two (2) different articles the caducidad of the
action:

a) “The creditor must notify the company in writing of the occurrence of any fact
which may give rise to a claim covered by this guaranty, within fifteen (15)
business days after acquiring knowledge of such occurrence.” This provision
does not address the caducidad, but it is obvious that if the creditor, who is
aware of the act that may give rise to a claim, does not notify the insurer
within the set term, it would forfeit the right to indemnification, given its
noncompliance with the foregoing clause.°*8

251. It is therefore clear that, under Venezuelan law, forfeiture of an identified right can
indeed be the contractually agreed effect for not performing a determined action
within the pre-established timeframe to do so. The same view has been upheld by
Venezuelan courts. It is thus evident that Article 14.3 of the Hamaca AA does not

encompass a concession by the Claimants to forfeit their right to seek compensation

for the damages caused by a DA.

First, unlike Section 9.07(e) of the Petrozuata AA for instance,>® nowhere does the
Hamaca AA refer to the Claimants’ right or entitlement to receive compensation for
the harm caused by a DA. Article 14.3(a) of the Hamaca AA simply states that the
Claimants were to “promptly [...] give notice” to the Respondents in the event the
Claimants considered that a DA had occurred.°°"

Second (even accepting that the right at stake is the one underlying a particular
notice requirement, in this case, the right to compensation),°©* the term “promptly” in
Article 14.3(a) is insufficient to constitute a peremptory interval further to which the
right in question must be deemed forfeited. The Tribunal is aware that, relying on the
opinion of Prof. Garcia Montoya, the Respondents argue that, “according to the
Supreme Tribunal of Justice, this type of timing requirement could not mean a delay
of nearly ten years”.%°> Still, the Tribunal notes that the only decision by the
Venezuelan Supreme Court invoked by Prof. Garcia Montoya does not fully support
his assertion.

In the TICAPSA case the Supreme Court held as follows:

In this regard, the Chamber notes that the word ‘immediately’ in the context
used by the rule and according to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of the
Spanish Language, is a synonym of ‘without delay, so the expression
‘immediately,’ is understood as something that had to be done directly
thereafter, without any type of delay.

[Ll
Therefore, the interpretation by the petitioning company, according to which this
provision meant that the registration of the debt could be sought “at any time,” is

erroneous.

Therefore, given that the credit contract at stake was executed on December
17, 1982, it is evident that the application for registration on February 23, 1983,

ie., more than two months later, is untimely according to Article 62 of Decree
No. 2.442 published in the Official Gazette No. 2.100, Extraordinary, of
November 15, 1977 [sic], because it was not carried out “immediately” after the
contract was executed.564

255. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Supreme Court's rationale in TICAPSA contains a

series of caveats that questions its direct applicability to the case at hand:

i. When promulgated (i.e. before the currency exchange control implemented in
Venezuela in 1983), article 62 of Decree No. 2.442 of 1977 (‘Article 62”)
allowed domestic corporations to conclude foreign contracts and lines of credit
for a period of 180 days (automatically renewable until revoked).

ii. The authorization of Article 62 was subject to the “immediat[e]” registration of
the foreign contracts or lines of credit after their conclusion.5®

The 180-day authorization granted by Article 62 was revoked by Resolution
No. 1.610 of 1983 (“Resolution 1610”). In turn, Resolution 1610 provided that
the unregistered foreign contracts and lines of credit that had been concluded
within last 180 days (under Article 62) had to be registered within the 5 days
following to the promulgation of Resolution 1610.5

iv. By the time Resolution 1610 was promulgated, the plaintiffs foreign contract
had not been certified as registered. Accordingly, the onus was on the plaintiff
to make sure that its foreign contract was properly registered before the
expiration of the 5-day peremptory term accorded by Resolution 1610.
Nonetheless, the plaintiff failed to act accordingly.*°”

celebrado las empresas dentro de los ciento ochenta (180) dias continuos anteriores a la presente fecha y que

259.

Thus the Supreme Court's ratio decidendi in TICAPSA was permeated by factual
considerations not present in the current dispute between the Parties. On the one
hand, the term “immediately” of Article 62 is distinct from the term “promptly” in Article
14.3(a) of the Hamaca AA. On the other hand, and more importantly, Resolution 1610
imposed a clear peremptory term that, in contrast, is lacking in the Hamaca AA. In
addition, principles of efficiency and speed innate to the proper discharge of
administrative functions also played an important role in the way the Supreme Court
approached the case.*® It is not clear whether these principles, however, ought not
be given nearly the same weight in a contractual setting.

The Tribunal therefore determines that the Claimants’ belated compliance with the
notice requirement vis-a-vis the Income Tax Increase does not entail, under
Venezuelan law, the caducidad of their right to seek compensation for the harm
caused by said DA. The Claimants’ notice by way of their RfA is sufficient to comply
with Article 14.3 of the Hamaca AA.

Accordingly, the Claimants are entitled to obtain compensation under the Hamaca AA
for the harm caused both by the Expropriation and the Income Tax Increase as
incurred, namely, from the year 2007 onwards.

The alleged obligation to exhaust alternative remedies and the consequences
thereof

The Respondents argue that the AAs expressly obligated the Claimants to exhaust all
domestic legal and administrative remedies as a pre-condition for obtaining
compensation.*®° To that effect, they rely on the Congressional Authorizations of the
AA's, their negotiation history, the text of the AAs themselves, as well as on witness
evidence. In short, the Respondents submit that such exhaustion requirement
extended to remedies available to obtain “revocation”, “reversal” or “relief [or remedy]
from the application of’ DAs, or actions that would “eliminate or lessen the impact” of
the said DAs. In the Respondents’ view, the Claimants’ pursuit of ICSID proceedings

does not fulfil this requirement under the AAs, as it will not result in such a remedy.2”°
Accordingly, the Claimants’ failure to comply with the “express” exhaustion
requirement of both AAs “provides an additional ground for dismissal” of the DA
claims in their entirety.9”"

The Claimants do not regard the AAs as mandating exhaustion of alternate remedies.
According to the Claimants, the pursuit of alternative remedies when faced with DAs
“is not a pre-condition to bringing a claim for indemnification under the DA
provisions”.°”? In any event, the Claimants submit that ICSID arbitration was the only
viable, practical and appropriate recourse available to them—a remedy that has been
diligently pursued and must therefore be deemed exhausted.°”°

In this context, the Claimants stress that attempting to pursue local proceedings
would have been futile.5’* Relying on allegedly well documented deficiencies in the
Venezuelan judicial system (burdened with systemic problems concerning the rule of
law, separation of powers, and corruption), the Claimants submit that the “notion that
[they], in 2007, could have achieved justice against the Chavez Administration in
Venezuelan courts is absurd.”3’5 On this basis, the Claimants argue that ICSID
arbitration offered the only realistic chance of obtaining relief from the DAs at issue.3’°
In turn, the Respondents submit that “futility” is not a recognized defense under
domestic law and further point to various remedies that the Claimants could have
pursued to obtain remedies against the DAs.°’”

By and large, the Respondents’ overall contention is premised on the following two
assumptions:

i. Before obtaining compensation for the damages caused by a DA, the
Claimants were required to first exhaust local remedies intended to revoke or
reverse the qualified measure at issue. In turn, this presupposes that the

terms “revocation”, “reversal”, “relief from the application”, “eliminate or lessen
the impact”, and “remedy from the application” (used either in the AAs and/or

their negotiating history), are all synonymous and distinct from legal actions
claiming for damages (such as resorting to ICSID arbitration).5’°

ii. Any remedy seeking to revoke, reverse, or obtain relief from the application of
a DA was to be sought through domestic judicial and/or administrative
proceedings. As such, ICSID arbitration was not the appropriate forum for the
Claimants to have pursued compensation for any harm caused by DAs.°7°

As discussed further under each AA separately, the Respondents’ position is
untenable.

i. Under the Hamaca AA

Article 14.3(a) of the Hamaca AA states that, “[i]n the event that a Foreign Party
considers that a Discriminatory Action has occurred, it promptly shall give notice
thereof (a “Notice of Discriminatory Act”) to Corpoven Sub and shall indicate whether
it believe[s] that such Discriminatory Action will result in Material Adverse Effect.
Promptly following receipt of such a notice, Corpoven Sub shall inform the notifying
Party of whether or not Corpoven Sub agrees that the notified action is a
Discriminatory Action which may lead to a Material Adverse Effect. Following
Corpoven Sub’s response, the claiming Party (the “Claiming Party”) [i.e. CPH] and
Corpoven Sub shall promptly meet to discuss any available legal remedies, such
as court or administrative proceedings, that may be appropriate to reverse or
obtain relief from the alleged Discriminatory Action”.5©°

The Hamaca Congresional Authorization (“HCA”) established that the Claimants were
to “exhaus[t] all remedies conferred upon [them] by the law to obtain the revocation
of the discriminatory measures [in question]’ before obtaining some form of
compensation.**! Materially identical language was suggested by the National
Executive in the draft of the Conditions for the Hamaca Project,°*? and by the
Congressional Bicameral Commission of Energy and Mines.*®° That being said, the
wording finally incorporated into the Hamaca AA is different. Article 14.3(a) of the
Hamaca AA disposes of the “all remedies” requirement in the HCA. Instead it refers to

268.

“any available legal remedies”.**4 From the term “cualesquiera’” in the original Spanish
version of the Hamaca AA,°°5 “any” is tantamount to “either” or even “whichever”.

The Hamaca AA also broadens the scope of the HCA by including other legal
remedies that can be pursued in the interest of redressing the harm caused by a DA.
Rather than limiting itself to remedies attaining the “revocation” of the DA,°®° Article
14.3(a) of the Hamaca AA refers to legal remedies that “may be appropriate to
reverse or obtain relief from the [application of the] alleged [DA]”.5°” Contrary to the
Respondents’ main assumption,®* it cannot be that the terms “revocation”,
“rever[sal]” and “obtain relief from the [application]’ are indistinguishable (i.e. all
requiring to “annul[l]” the “administrative act or the law that created the specific
Discriminatory Actions”).5°9

First, failure to differentiate between the aforementioned terms would lead to the
conclusion that the Parties sought to accord the same significance and meaning to
different terms. This is even more so considering that Article 14.3(a) itself refers to the
term “reverse” alternatively to the term “obtain relief’ — the provision does not require
a legal remedy to obtain both “revers[al]” of a DA and “relief” from the application of a
DA.5® Conversely, had the Parties intended to exclude legal remedies whose primary
objective is to secure the payment of compensation (such as ICSID arbitration), the
“revocation” standard contained in the HCA would have been maintained.

Second, while Article 14.3(a) of the Hamaca AA somewhat departs from the Twenty-
First Condition of the HCA,*°" it does not mean that both instruments are in conflict.

384 The Tribunal notes that, in its relevant part, the Spanish version of Article 14.3(a) of the Hamaca AA, reads as
follows: “[...] cualesquiera recursos legales disponibles [...!" (Hamaca AA, C-3 (original in Spanish), Article
14.3(a), p. 542). In this regard, the Tribunal is aware that the official English translation of the Hamaca AA
translates the terms “cualesquiera recursos legales disponibles” as “formal legal remedies” (Hamaca AA, C-3,
Article 14.3(a)). Nevertheless, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondents’ submission that, in this part, the original
Spanish version of the Hamaca AA is better translated as “any available legal remedies” (Rejoinder, fn. 678; R-
PHB, fn. 382). In this context, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that the Hamaca AA was originally executed in
Spanish and that, “[iJn the event of any conflict between the Spanish language document and its respective
translation, the executed document shall prevail for all purposes” (Hamaca AA, C-3, p. 99). Incidentally, the
Tribunal notes that the Petrozuata AA was also executed in a “single original in the Spanish language”
(Petrozuata AA, C-1, Section 13.17).

The Twenty-Seventh Condition of the HCA provides that the Hamaca AA, “in its final
version, before it is signed, shall be sent to the Ministry of Energy and Mines so that,
prior to its approval by the President of the Republic in Council of the Ministers, it can
be sent to the Legislative Chambers of Congress, so that they, by agreement, may
verify that it meets these conditions”.°%? It is common ground that the process in the
Twenty-Seventh Condition of the HCA was carried out.*°? Consequently, the final
version of the Hamaca AA was deemed HCA-compliant.2% The same _ is
acknowledged by the Hamaca AA itself.39° As such, it is reasonable to accept that, in
the event of “any inconsistencies between [the Congressional Authorization of April
1997] and the [Authorization of the final Hamaca AA of June 1997], which is the
[Hamaca AA] itself, the [Hamaca AA] controls”.3%

269. Third, the record allows distinctions to be drawn between “revocation”, “rever[sal]”,
and “obtain relief from the [application]” of a DA. “Revocation” is generally carried out
by the same institution vested with the authority to issue the disputed measure in the
first place. This coincides with the understanding of Prof. Garcia Montoya that,
pursuant to a “recurso de reconsideracién”, the entity issuing a measure may be
called upon to modify or revoke it.3°’ In turn, “rever[sal]” is arguably similar to a

Agreement and agreements in the forms attached as Exhibits hereto pursuant to Congressional Resolution
(Acuerdo) of the Congress of the Republic of Venezuela, dated June 11, 1997, published in the Official Gazette of
the Republic ofVenezuela No. 36,235 dated June 26, 1997”) (emphasis added). Evidently then, the Preamble of
the Hamaca AA was concluded in accordance with the Congresional Authorization of 24 April 1997 and, in
particular, pursuant to the Authorization of the final Hamaca AA of 11 June 1997. The Tribunal is aware that the
Respondents also refer to Article 2.1(c) of the Hamaca AA in order to argue that the Hamaca Project was to be
“carried out in accordance with the requirements set forth...in the Conditions” (Rejoinder, fn. 678; R-PHB, fn.
1114). With this the Respondents seem to suggest that the Congressional Authorization should somehow prevail
over the text of the Hamaca AA. However, the Tribunal notes that Article 2.1(c) refers to the “activities
contemplated in [the Hamaca AA]" (Hamaca AA, C-3, Article 2.1(c)). To wit, “all the vertically integrated activities
necessary for the exploration, development, i itatic blending, i ializatic i
refining, upgrading, and commercialization of Extra-Heavy Oil [...] and the transportation and use or disposal of

396 Tr. (Day 2), 295:7-14 (Mr. Manning). The Tribunal is aware that the Respondents refer to the May 1996
Hamaca Preliminary Term Sheet (C-41, p. 21; Rejoinder, § 352; R-PHB, §§ 186, 553). The Preliminary Term
Sheet contains wording similar to both the draft (infra, fn. 399) and final HCA (supra, § 264). However, given the
difference in drafting between the Preliminary Term Sheet and the final text of the Hamaca AA, the Tribunal
considers that the former is of no real assistance to interpret the latter.

disposicion el recurso de reconsideracién administrativa para obtener la modificacién 0 revocacién de cualquier

Prof. Garcia Montoya’s First Legal Expert Report employs the term “withdrawal” rather than “revocation” (Garcia
Montoya ER |, RER-1, § 137), but considers that such a variation has no impact on the Tribunal’s view; Organic

revocation in that it may cause the challenged measure to cease to exist and
generate effects. However, generally speaking, a measure tends to be reversed by
an entity (judicial or administrative) different from the one issuing it in the first place.
Regardless, it is not a foregone conclusion that one can exclusively “obtain relief from
the [application]’ of a DA by way of legal actions formally invalidating/terminating the
DA at issue. First, ICSID arbitration would be an example in point whether it qualifies
in the present context as one of the available remedies under Article 14.3(a) of the
Hamaca AA. Second, in fact, nothing prevents “obtain[ing] relief from the
[application]’ of a DA through the payment of monetary compensation. Indeed, the
Tribunal notes that the original Spanish version of the Hamaca AA does not even
allude to “relief’. Rather it speaks in terms of “eliminating the effects of the [alleged
DA]’.2°8 Naturally, such drafting is not necessarily concerned with the formal
existence or nullity of the disputed DA. It mostly caters to redressing the harm
suffered as a result of a discriminatory and unjust qualified measure. In this context, a
decision awarding damages is apposite. Overall, the Respondents appear to confuse
the phrase “obtain[ing] relief from the [application]’ in the official translation of Article
14.3(a), with the phrase “released [or exempted] from the application” in the draft
HCA.°°9 When contrasted, the latter may, to some extent, support the Respondents’
position. However, the wording of current Article 14.3(a) of the Hamaca AA does not.

Fourth, construing the terms “revocation”, “rever[sal]” and “relief from the
[application]’ as synonyms is problematic in light of the remainder of Article 14.3(a) of
the Hamaca AA. In its relevant part, Article 14.3(a) states:

[Alny net proceeds received by [CPH] as a result of [legal remedies appropriate
to reverse or obtain relief from the alleged DAs], net of legal fees and costs,
shall be applied against any amounts ultimately determined to be owing by
Corporven Sub to [CPH] or reimbursed to Corpoven Sub if Corpoven Sub has
previously made payments to [CPH] in respect of such DA.4°°

actuaciones”. In view of this, the Tribunal considers that the term “/iberar’ is better translated as “relieved” or even
“exempted”. In any event, “relieve” (as translated by the Respondents) and “relief” (as in the official translation of
Article 14.3(a) of the Hamaca AA) are not necessarily equivalent.

271. As argued by the Claimants, the foregoing envisages the eventuality “to offset” two
different amounts.*°' On the one hand, any amounts received by the Claimants
directly from the Respondents in accordance with the indemnity granted by the DA
provisions. On the other hand, any amounts received by the Claimants from, in
principle, the Government, as the result of a legal remedy obtaining relief from the
application of a particular DA.4°? If the Hamaca AA is interpreted to preclude the
Claimants from directly seeking an award on damages, then the right to offset would
therefore be essentially devoid of meaning. The Tribunal cannot uphold such a
construction.

272. In light of the above, the Tribunal determines that Article 14.3(a) of the Hamaca AA
allowed the Claimants to make direct recourse to any legal remedy “appropriate to
[L..] obtain relief from the alleged [DA]’—including by way of seeking monetary
compensation for the harm caused. The Tribunal’s conclusion is consistent with the
relevant witness evidence relied upon by the Respondents. Contrary to the
Respondents’ rather misleading portrayal of Mr. Manning’s testimony,4°3 Mr. Manning
confirmed at the Hearing that Article 14.3(a) gave the Claimants two options when
faced with a DA. On the one hand, seeking either the reversal (or the revocation) of
the DA. On the other hand, attempting to obtain monetary relief directly from the
Government.*°5

273. The issue now turns to whether ICSID arbitration was an appropriate forum for the
Claimants to obtain the aforesaid compensation or monetary relief. In this regard, the
Respondents submit:

[Elven if the claim for damages asserted in the ICSID Arbitration could
somehow be characterized as a remedy to obtain the “revocation,” “reversal” or
“relief from” Discriminatory Actions, the Hamaca Congressional Authorization

403 R-PHB, § 556. The Tribunal notes that the Respondents also refer to Mr. Appel's testimony at the ICSID
Hearing (R-PHB, § 555). Nevertheless, Mr. Appel simply confirmed that the Twenty-First Condition of the
Congressional Authorization required the revocation of the DA at issue before the Claimants could obtain
compensation. The Tribunal has already dealt with the differences between the Congressional Authorization and
the Hamaca AA (supra, §§ 264-268).

laws,” clearly referring to Venezuelan laws. Hamaca Association Agreement

also required the foreign party to “diligently pursue” “any available legal

remedies, such as administrative or judicial proceedings,” which again is not a

reference to ICSID arbitration. 4°

274. The Tribunal notes that there is no material disagreement between the Parties as to

arbitration being a valid legal remedy under Venezuelan law.4°” Indeed, it would be
difficult to argue otherwise. The 1999 Venezuelan Constitution expressly recognizes
“alternative means of justice”, such as arbitration, as part of the Venezuelan justice
system.*°8 Moreover, the Venezuelan Supreme Court has openly recognized the
“historical [...] constitutionalization of arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution
method, [...] this principle has been included in a number of legislative texts.
[Accordingly, the Venezuelan Constitution] broadened the justice system to include
alternative dispute resolution methods, including arbitration, adding these
mechanisms to the regular jurisdictional authority exercised by the Judicial
Branch [...]".4°9

275. Against this backdrop there is no hesitation in finding that arbitration, and
presumably, ICSID arbitration, can be considered either: (i) as a remedy conferred
upon the Claimants “by the laws” of Venezuela, in accordance with the HCA;41°
and/or (ii) as an “available legal remed[y]”, in accordance with the Hamaca AA.‘""

276. Admittedly, the Hamaca AA speaks of “any available legal remedies, such as
administrative and judicial proceedings’.*’? As the Respondents argue, a
reference to “administrative and judicial proceedings” is not a reference to ICSID
arbitration.‘ However, it is not a definitive exclusion of ICSID arbitration either.

406 R-PHB, § 555.

407 C-PHB, § 23 (“Respondents do not deny that international arbitration is a valid remedy under Venezuelan
law’); R-PHB, fn. 112 (“Professor Mata Borjas’ only comment on this point was his statement that “arbitration is a
valid remedy under Venezuelan law.’ [...] But the issue is not whether Venezuelan law permits the arbitration of
disputes; it is whether Claimants have met the requirements of exhaustion of “all” available remedies to
obtain the “revocation,” “reversal” or “relief from” Discriminatory Actions by seeking a monetary award in
the ICSID Arbitration. As Professor Garcia Montoya confirmed both in his Second Report and at the Hearing,
the answer is clearly no”) (emphasis added). The Tribunal has already established that an award on damages
(such as the one obtainable through ICSID proceedings) falls within the purview of Article 14.3(a) of the Hamaca
AA (supra, §§ 264-272). Hence, all that remains standing in the Respondents’ contention is not taking issue with
how arbitration (presumably including ICSID arbitration) is indeed a valid remedy under Venezuelan law.

Article 14.3(a) of the Hamaca AA is drafted in a non-exhaustive fashion. The term
“such as” leads the Tribunal to believe that the reference to “administrative and
judicial proceedings” constitutes an indication or suggestion — certainly not a
limitation. Further, the term “any available legal remedies” certainly does not exclude
ICSID arbitration either. Put simply, the Hamaca AA does not “anticipatorily define or
delimit the alternative remedies that might be available or that the Claimants might
choose to pursue”.4"4 If it did, however, it would be questionable whether the Parties
could be deemed to have waived “available legal remedies” (such as recourse to
ICSID arbitration) before the existence of a dispute. Thus, Article 14.3(a) of the
Hamaca, even more so than the HCA,‘*® accommodates the possibility to resort to
ICSID arbitration for the purposes of obtaining relief from the application of a
particular DA. The Respondents’ argument that the Parties did not contemplate the
possibility of ICSID arbitration when entering into the AAs changes nothing.4*® The
caveated text of the Hamaca AA left the window open.*"” For the Tribunal this is
sufficiently dispositive of the issue in favor of the Claimants.

277. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal determines that, by resorting to ICSID
arbitration, the Claimants have adequately discharged the requirement to pursue
alternative legal remedies in accordance with Article 14.3(a) of the Hamaca AA.
Consequently, the Tribunal need not address the Parties’ remaining arguments on
the matter.

ji. Under the Petrozuata AA

278. Unlike with the Hamaca AA and the HCA,‘® the Petrozuata Congressional
Authorization (“PCA”) contains no requirement of the exhaustion of alternative
remedies with respect to DAs. The PCA’s Sixteenth Condition simply authorized the
inclusion of provisions enabling the Respondents to compensate the Claimants when
harmed by a DA.*1° The Petrozuata Bicameral Commission Report did contemplate

414 C-PHB, § 167; Reply, § 227.

418 In this context the Tribunal recalls its determination that, in the event of inconsistencies between the
Congressional Authorization and the Hamaca AA, the latter must be deemed controlling (Supra, § 268).

418 SoD, § 319; R-PHB, fn. 1121.

417 Furthermore, the Tribunal notes that, albeit in a different context, the possibility of ICSID arbitration was
contemplated in Article 17.8 of the Hamaca AA (C-3).

418 Supra, §§ 259-264.

419 Petrozuata Congressional Authorization, C-25, Sixteenth Condition (“Provisions shall be included in the
Association Agreement that enable Maraven to compensate the other parties, on equitable terms, for significant
adverse economic consequences directly resulting from decisions made by national, state or municipal
administrative agencies or any changes in the law that, because of their content or purpose, result in an unjust
discriminatory treatment of the Company or such other parties, always understood in their Capacity as such and

280.

that, “in the event [a discriminatory and unjust qualified measure] takes place, the
affected partner must exhaust the legal remedies that are available to it to eliminate
or lessen the impact of such measures”.4° However, there is no mention of any
exhaustion requirement in the actual draft Sixteenth Condition proposed by the
Bicameral Commission for Congress’ consideration.421 This explains why the PCA
fails to require the exhaustion of alternative remedies in order for the Claimants to
obtain indemnity against the Respondents.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 9.07(d) of the Petrozuata AA does state that,
“to the fullest extent practicable, [the Claimants were required to] commence and
exhaust all available legal and administrative actions which may provide a
remedy from the application of such [DAs]”.‘2? In view of Section 9.07(d), the
Respondents raise two main arguments. First, they argue that the requirement to
pursue a “remedy from the application” of a DA in Section 9.07(d) concerns the
standard set forth in the Petrozuata Bicameral Commission Report, namely, to pursue
actions that would “eliminate or lessen the impact” of that DA. Accordingly, a claim for
damages (as could be obtained by the Claimants in the ICSID Arbitration) does not
meet that requirement—the requirement can only be satisfied by seeking the nullity of
the DA. 47° Second, the Respondents contend that, in any event, the Petrozuata AA
requires the Claimants to exhaust “all” remedies, not just the one deemed
“appropriate” by the Claimants. 424

The Respondents’ first argument is tantamount to a non-sequitur. The requirement to
seek a “remedy from the application” of a DA is akin to taking legal action to
“eliminate or lessen the impact” of the said DA. Nevertheless, this does not mean that
either standard precludes pursuing monetary compensation. Quite to the contrary,
nothing points to the conclusion that one can only obtain “remedy from the
application” of a DA through its invalidation or nullity. It is perfectly feasible to obtain
such remedy through an award on damages (as through ICSID arbitration). It is telling

 

as parties to the Association Agreement, all without prejudice to the sovereign right to legislate inherent in the
very existence of the national, state and municipal legislative branches”).

422 Petrozuata AA, C-1, Section 9.07(d) (emphasis added). Despite the disconnect between the PCA and the
Petrozuata AA, the latter states that “The transactions contemplated in this Agreement have been approved by
the Venezuelan Congress in accordance with Article 5 of the Organic Law as set forth in the Official Gazette
Number 35.293 dated 9 September, 1993” (Petrozuata AA, C-1, Antecedents, § 11).

that the Respondents are unable to advance any substantive convincing argument to
the contrary and basically only rely on the text of Section 9.07(d) to support their
defense.

The Tribunal’s view is further confirmed by the “offset” provision in Section 9.07(d).
Similarly to the Hamaca AA,‘ Section 9.07(d) of the Petrozuata AA contemplates
that, should the Claimants be “ultimately successful in obtaining a remedy, or
[otherwise obtain] economic relief intended to offset the [DA] as a result of another
legislative or administrative action which was not generally applicable to most
enterprises in Venezuela, then: (i) the [Claimants] shall refund [the Respondents] any
discrimination compensation already payed which corresponds to the remedy or relief
which has been obtained by the [Claimants]; and/or (ii) the damages shall be
recalculated to take into consideration the remedy or economic relief obtained, as
the case may be”.47° Again,4?” should it be understood that the Petrozuata AA
precludes seeking remedy from the application of DAs through monetary
compensation, then the “offset” provision of Section 9.07(d) would essentially be
rendered without effect. Indeed, the explicit reference to “economic relief’ by way of a
distinct qualified measure suggests that, broadly, Section 9.07(d) is primarily
concerned with the monetary consequence of a DA and not so much, if at all, with the
formal validity of a DA within the Venezuelan legal system.

Overall, Article 14.3(a) of the Hamaca AA and Section 9.07(d) of the Petrozuata AA
describe in similar terms the legal actions available to the Claimants to counter a DA.
Accordingly, the considerations made by the Tribunal above with respect to the
former are applicable, mutatis mutandis, to the latter.4?® Nevertheless, Section 9.07(d)
encompasses two particular elements distinguishing it from Article 14.3(a). First,
Section 9.07(d) does not make any reference to remedies appropriate to “reverse” a
DA.*?9 Second, lacking a requirement to exhaust alternative remedies before claiming
indemnity from the Respondents, the PCA (as opposed to the HCA) does not call for
the “revocation” of DAs.**° In fact, neither does the Bicameral Commission Report.4"
Put simply, nothing in the text of Section 9.07(d) or its negotiating history suggests

284.

that the Claimants were expected to seek the annulment or invalidation of the DAs at
issue. Therefore, taken as a whole, Section 9.07(d) appears to incentivize securing
monetary compensation as an appropriate remedy from the application of a DA.
Consequently, the Tribunal determines that any legal remedy resulting in an award on
damages complies with the requirements set forth in Section 9.07(d) of the
Petrozuata AA.

In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Respondents have not explicitly raised the
alternative argument regarding appropriate forum as in relation to the Hamaca AA.432
For the sake of clarity and completeness, however, the Tribunal is of the view that
such an argument would have in any event failed. In the context of the Petrozuata
AA, the argument would hypothetically run as follows: assuming that an award on
damages could somehow be characterized as a “remedy from the application” of a
DA under Section 9.07(d), the Petrozuata AA required the Claimants to pursue such
remedy in domestic proceedings—not in international investment arbitration. Yet, as
already established, arbitration is a valid legal remedy under Venezuelan law.4%3 In
turn, Section 9.07(d) of the Petrozuata AA requires the Claimants to pursue, inter alia,
“legal [...] actions”. Notably, and contrary to the Hamaca AA,‘ Article 9.07(d) does
not even attempt indicating or suggesting, in a non-exhaustive fashion, which “legal
actions” those might be.‘ It follows that ICSID arbitration can be considered an
appropriate forum to pursue compensation in accordance with 9.07(d) of the
Petrozuata AA.

The Tribunal now turns to the Respondents’ second argument, namely, that recourse
to ICSID arbitration would in any event be insufficient to satisfy the exhaustion
requirement of Section 9.07(d), as Claimants were to exhaust “all” remedies — not
just one.*%® It is the Respondents’ contention that Venezuelan law accorded the
Claimants three avenues to address each of the DAs at issue, namely: “(i) a petition
for reconsideration (recurso de reconsideraci6n), an administrative remedy to seek
the modification or withdrawal of an administrative measure; (ii) an autonomous
summary proceeding to guarantee constitutional rights (accién de amparo
constitucional auténomo), an action to challenge the constitutionality of legislative,

286.

administrative or judicial acts; and (iii) a petition for annulment (recurso de nulidad) to
have declared null any act of the Government in conflict with the Constitution or
laws”.48” Given that the claimants did not pursue any of these remedies, “[flailure to
do so is failure to comply with the express requirements for obtaining compensation
under the [DA] provisions of the [Petrozuata AA]. That failure precludes the assertion
of [the Claimants’ DA claims]”.43°

The Respondents’ position is unpersuasive. First, the Tribunal finds the Respondents’
emphasis on the literal meaning of the Petrozuata AA to be somewhat inconsistent.
When making its argument on the matter in the context of the Hamaca AA, the
Respondents heavily relied on the HCA to bring the “revocation” standard therein into
the Hamaca AA.“°° This, despite the fact that the Hamaca AA makes no reference to
the “revocation” of a DA.“4° Nevertheless, the Respondents have conveniently
ignored that, as seen, the PCA contains no exhaustion requirement whatsoever.*4! To
the same extent, the Bicameral Commission Report that the Respondents rely
upon“? simply states the following: “the affected partner shall exhaust the legal
remedies within its reach to eliminate or lessen the impact of the [DAs]”.443 Once
more, there is no indication that the Claimants were expected to exhaust each and
every relevant remedy under Venezuelan law. Hence, if the Bicameral Commission
Report (or any other pre-contractual document) is to be given interpretative value, as
the Respondents submit should be the case,‘44 then the term “all” in Section 9.07(d)
should be construed as equivalent to “any” (as in the Hamaca AA).445

Second, the term “all” in Section 9.07(d) is qualified by the term “to the fullest
practicable” in the same provision.4#6 It may be the case that “practicable” constitutes

a higher threshold than, for instance, “reasonable under the circumstances”.“47
Notwithstanding the foregoing, “practicable” does suggest that the term “all” cannot
be construed as an unfettered reference to “every” available legal remedy against the
application of a DA. In the Tribunal’s view, context matters.

The Tribunal has already established that Section 9.07(d) primarily endorses the
Claimants’ view on exhaustion of remedies whereby the Claimants could obtain
monetary compensation for the harm caused by a DA (such as through ICSID
arbitration).448 This is consistent with the Bicameral Commission Report. The Report
contemplated that, should the Claimants fail to succeed in their legal remedies to
“eliminate or lessen the impact” of a DA, they could: “request a renegotiation of the
terms of the AA and/or of its complementary agreements with the aim of
compensating the economic damage caused by the discriminatory measure, in the
sense that [they] would be placed in a position that, from an economic point of view,
would be equivalent to the one [they] would find [themselves] under had the measure
not taken place”.*49 Evidently, legal remedies only attaining the invalidity of a DA
would have resulted in the Claimants (always) being unsuccessful in obtaining
redress for the economic damage caused by the DA. In other words, the mere
invalidity of a DA (i.e. its exclusion as an existant qualified measure generating
effects) would have (always) required either the renegotiation of the Petrozuata AA or
further proceedings.

In turn, the Tribunal notes that, according to the Claimants, neither the “recurso de
reconsideraci6n”,“° the “accién de amparo”, the “recurso constitucional auténomo’”,
nor the “recurso de nulidad”*5' “would have resulted in compensation to the
Claimants”.45? The Respondents indeed submit that the foregoing actions should
have been nonetheless initiated.*°° Yet, they do not seem to contest the Claimants’

447 Letter from Mr. van Wagenigen to Mr. Carillo, 16 September 1993, § 58:14-16 (‘[...] we nevertheless note that
mitigating actions should be actions that are ‘reasonable under the circumstances’ not those that are ‘practicable’,
which is a higher standard”).

Tribunal).

450 The Tribunal notes that the Parties’ experts agree that the recurso de reconsideraci6n is only applicable to
administrative acts, strictly speaking. Therefore, it is not at all relevant in the context of either the Expropriation or
the Income Tax Increase (Brewer-Carias ER, CER-5, § 81; Garcia Montoya ER II, RER-5 § 127).

assertion that, had they done so, compensation would not have been obtained.45* As
argued by the Claimants, ICSID proceedings appear to have constituted the only
“viable alternative available”#°> potentially resulting in actual compensation.*°°

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal determines that, by resorting to ICSID
arbitration, the Claimants have adequately discharged the requirement to pursue
“practicable” alternative legal remedies in accordance with Section 9.07(d) of the
Petrozuata AA. Consequently, the Tribunal need not address the Parties’ remaining
arguments on the matter, including the Claimants’ position on the futility of any local
remedies.

The Congressional Authorizations
The Tribunal notes that the Twenty-First Condition of the HCA states as follows:

In no case will it be understood that the application of [the DA provisions in the
Hamaca AA] affects or restricts in any way the power of the governmental
bodies (“Organos del Poder Publico”) to adopt measures pursuant to the
Constitution and applicable Laws.*5”

In turn, the Sixteenth Condition of the PCA reads as follows:

[The DA provisions in the Petrozuata AA shall be included] without prejudice to

the sovereign right to legislate inherent in the very existence of the national,

state and municipal legislative branches.4°°
It is clear to the Tribunal that, in principle, the exercise of sovereign power cannot be
limited by way of private agreement. That being said, nothing prevents contractual
parties from envisaging the possible impact of State action in their undertaking and
therefore providing for the contractual consequences in case of such eventuality.

Accordingly, Venezuela’s legislative, governmental, and regulatory power is by no
means hindered by the AAs in general, and by the DA provisions therein in particular,
nor by the Tribunal’s determinations pursuant to the latter. The Tribunal’s conclusions
(summarized below)*® should not be construed as questioning the validity or the
legitimacy of the Royalty Measure, the Extraction Tax, the Income Tax Increase, or

the Expropriation. Indeed, the Tribunal makes no pronouncement on Venezuela's

sovereign prerogative to adopt these measures. Rather, the Tribunal’s findings simply

ascertain whether the aforementioned measures qualify as DAs in accordance with

the corresponding definition provided in the AAs and, if so, whether and to what

extent the Respondents (not Venezuela) must indemnify the Claimants pursuant to

the said mutually agreed contractual mechanisms: in line with the HCA and the PCA,

Venezuela's sovereign rights remain intact.

Conclusion

In light of the above analysis, the Tribunal finds that:

vi.

For a qualified measure to be characterized as a DA under the Petrozuata or
the Hamaca AA, the said measure must be both: (i) “discriminatory”; and (ii)
“unjust” as a result of causing SED or MAE.

The Expropriation constitutes a “discriminatory” qualified measure under both
AAs. Therefore, it meets the first prong for being deemed a DA.

The Royalty Measure and/or the Extraction Tax cannot be considered
“discriminatory” under either AA. Therefore, they do not meet the first prong
for being deemed DAs.

. The Claimants have failed to substantiate why the Royalty Measure, the

Extraction Tax, and the Expropriation, are - when assessed cumulatively (i.e.
the Overall Expropriation) - “discriminatory” pursuant to the DA provisions of
either AA. Consequently, the Overall Expropriation cannot be considered
“discriminatory”. As such, it fails to meet the first prong for being deemed a
DA.

The Income Tax Increase constitutes a “discriminatory” measure under both
AAs. Therefore, it meets the first prong for being deemed a DA.

Both the Expropriation and the Income Tax Increase are “unjust” for having
caused either SED or MAE to the Claimants. Therefore, they both meet the
second prong for being deemed DAs.

i. Thus the Expropriation and the Income Tax Increase meet both prongs for

being deemed DAs. As such, the Expropriation and the Income Tax are the

131

only qualified measures at issue that can be characterized as DAs under
either the Petrozuata AA or the Hamaca AA.

viii. The AAs contain provisions requiring the Claimants to notify the Respondents
should they consider that a DA has taken place. This requirement must be
assessed in light of its object and purpose, namely, to inform the Respondents
of how a particular qualified measure could trigger their contractual obligations
under the DA provisions of each AA.

ix. The record shows that, upon the occurrence of the Expropriation in 2007, the
Respondents were aware of their indemnity obligations towards the Claimants
in accordance with the DA provisions of the AAs. Accordingly, as far as the
Expropriation is concerned, the notice requirements of the AAs were
discharged in 2007.

x. There is no evidence on the record clearly accounting for the Respondents’
awareness of the “discriminatory” and “unjust” treatment resulting from the
Income Tax Increase. None of the communications sent by the Claimants
after the adoption of the Income Tax Increase can be considered as an
attempt to inform the Respondents of how, in the Claimants’ view, the Income
Tax Increase constituted a DA. It was with the commencement of this
arbitration that the Respondents gained (in accordance with the AA’s
provisions) cognizance of the potential characterization of the Income Tax
Increase as a DA. Accordingly, the notice requirements in the AAs in relation
to the Income Tax Increase were only discharged in 2014.

xi. Section 9.07(e) of the Petrozuata AA precludes the Claimants from seeking
compensation for all cash flows lost as a result of DAs prior to the year in
which the AA’s notice requirements are deemed satisfied. The Claimants are
only entitled to receive compensation under the Petrozuata AA for the harm
caused by: (i) the Expropriation, as from 2007; and (ii) the Income Tax
Increase, as from 2013 (i.e. the fiscal year before the initiation of this

arbitration).

x.

ii. The Hamaca AA lacks a provision akin to Section 9.07(e) of the Petrozuata
AA. Further, the Respondents have failed to demonstrate that the Claimants’
belated compliance with the notice requirement vis-a-vis the Income Tax
Increase entafils forfeiture of their right under the Hamaca AA to seek
compensation for the harm caused by the said DA. The Claimants are

132

therefore entitled to obtain compensation under the Hamaca AA for the harm
caused both by the Expropriation and the Income Tax Increase as incurred,
namely, from the year 2007 onwards.

xiii. By resorting to ICSID arbitration, the Claimants have adequately discharged
the requirement to pursue alternative legal remedies in accordance with
Article 14.3(a) of the Hamaca AA and Section 9.07(d) of the Petrozuata AA.

c. THE WILLFUL BREACH CLAIMS
1. The Claimants’ position

295. The Claimants submit that Articles 1264 and 1271 of the VCC‘ impose an obligation
to perform contracts, such that the “total non-performance of [the] contract” and/or the
“intentional destruction of a contract” constitutes a “willful breach”, giving rise to an
entitlement to damages.**' The Claimants allege that the following two broad sets of
actions constitute a “willful breach” of the Respondents’ contractual obligations, and
engage their civil liability under Venezuelan law:

(i) Failure _to use “reasonable commercial efforts”: According to the
Claimants, the Respondents were obligated to exercise “reasonable
commercial efforts” with a view to ensuring the success of the Projects.
They contend that the Respondents’ “reasonable commercial efforts”
obligation arises from express provisions of the AAs,*® and is informed by
the context in which these contracts were entered into; as well as the duty
of good faith set forth in Article 1160 of the VCC.‘® In this context, the
Claimants argue that the Respondents’ allegedly active role in

489 VCC, CLA-2, Article 1264 (“Obligations shall be performed exactly as they were undertaken. The debtor is
liable for damages in the event of breach.”); Article 1271 (“The debtor shall be ordered to pay damages, both for
the non-performance of the obligation as well as for the delay in the performance thereof, unless he proves that
the non-performance or delay arises from an external cause not attributable to him, even though there has been
no bad faith on his part.”)

481 C-PHB, §§ 2, 26, 179; SoC, §§ 164-213; Tr. (Day 1), 69-91 (Claimant's Opening Statement) (Counsel: “[...] A
Party to a contract who acts in such a way as to disable itself from living up to its promises breaches that contract
[...] and if such actions are carried out intentionally, the willfulness of the breach makes it indispensable, as a
matter of principle, to have aggravated sanctions in order to discourage intentional conscious breach.”)

482 The relevant provisions relied upon by the Claimants are Sections 2.04(a), 9.01(b) and Preambular Clauses 6
and 10 of the Petrozuata AA along with Articles 2.1(b), 10.4(a) and 10.5(a) of the Hamaca AA, which are set out
in relevant part at §§ 335-337, infra.

463 C-PHB, §§ 187, 198-206; VCC, CLA-2, Article 1160 (“Contracts must be performed in good faith, and are
binding not only with respect to what is expressed therein, but also with regard to all the consequences arising
therefrom, according to equity, custom, or the Law.”).

133

collaborating with the Government and bringing about the destruction of
the AAs constitutes a breach of this particular contractual obligation;4

(ii) The _non-performance of the AAs and the Guarantees: The Claimants
submit that under the above provisions of the VCC, the Respondents were
obligated to perform the AAs and the Guarantees. They argue that the
Respondents’ total non-performance of these contracts “from 2007
onwards” constitutes “the most fundamental breach” under Venezuelan

law.466

296. Turning to the facts, the Claimants allege that the following acts/omissions by the
Respondents constitute willful breaches of the above two broad obligations identified
in the preceding paragraph:

(a) public statements by Messers. Ramirez and Del Pino, and Dr. Mommer, and

others, in 2005, 2006, and 2007 calling for “nationalization”, “migration”, the
dismantling of the Apertura, and the subjugation of PDVSA to the State;

(b) the roles played by Messers. Ramirez and Del Pino and Dr. Mommer from
2002 onwards regarding the transformation of the technocratic “old PDVSA”
into the politicized “new PDVSA”;

(c) the dual roles of Mr. Ramirez and Dr. Mommer at the Ministry and PDVSA
from 2004/2005 onwards;

(d) PDVSA’s desperate need for additional funds to meet its new social
spending obligations in the lead-up to the final dispossession;

(e) PDVSA’s genesis and development of Plan Siembra Petrolera...from 2005
onwards...[and the] confirmation that ‘[t]his plan came out of the PDVSA, the
plan was developed in PDVSA.’

[el

(h) Dr. Mommer’s admitted role as the architect of the fiscal measures
preceeding the final taking (the Royalty Measure, the Extraction Tax, and the
Income Tax Increase), including at times when he was employed solely by
PDVSA;

464 The Tribunal also notes that the Willful Breach Claim has evolved since the beginning of this arbitration. In the
Request, the Claimants alleged that the Respondents had willfully breached the AAs and the duty of good faith
under Article 1160 of the VCC without any further substantiation. In their SoC and their Opening Statement during
the Hearing, the Claimants appear to have clarified the Willful Breach Claims as a breach of various provisions of
the AAs (as will be elaborated upon infra, §§ 335-337) which obligated the Respondents to exercise “reasonable
commercial efforts” vis-a-vis the Projects. The final phase of this evolution was achieved in the C-PHB, where in
addition to maintaining their argument regarding breach of various contractual provisions and the duty of good
faith, the Claimants argued for the first time that the very non-performance of the AAs also constituted “the most
fundamental of breaches” (C-PHB, § 26).

465 C-PHB, § 2(b).

486 The above two acts collectively constitute the Claimants’ “Willful Breach Claims” and are respectively referred
to as the “First Willful Breach Claim” and the “Second Willful Breach Claim.”.

(k) PDVSA’s role in implementing the Nationalization Decree, and the fiscal
benefits it reaped therefrom; and

(l) PDVSA and its subsidiaries’ total non-performance of the AAs and the
Guarantees during the course of 2007 and thereafter.4®”

In opposition to the Respondents’ arguments, the Claimants submit that (i) the Willful
Breach Claims are arbitrable as they arise out of a series of contractual breaches and
do not seek to challenge the validity of a sovereign act by the Government, namely
the promulgation of the 2007 Nationalization Decree;** (ii) the Respondents cannot
escape liability for their breaches by arguing that their actions/omissions were “in
compliance with law” (i.e. the 2007 Nationalization Decree) because although this
ground may be validly invoked in the event the law is external to the Respondents,
the same does not hold true in the present case, where the Respondents were
instrumental in both “securing and implementing the Nationalization Decree”;*® (iii) in
any event, the Respondents’ active role in securing and implementing the 2007
Nationalization Decree also means that this Decree was attributable to the
Respondents and they are therefore the “cause” of the Claimants’ loss;4”° and, finally,
(iv) the Respondents’ argument that the 10 year delay in asserting the Willful Breach
Claims constitutes a “disloyal delay” under Venezuelan law is untenable, as the
claims have been brought within the applicable statutory limitation period (i.e., 10
years) and, in any event, there was no obligation upon the Claimants to provide any
notice of their Willful Breach Claims.”

The Respondents’ position

First and foremost, the Respondents challenge the foundation of the Willful Breach
Claims on the ground that they are not arbitrable. The Respondents submit that “the
only identifiable conduct of Respondents alleged by Claimants [as constituting willful

breach,] consists of compliance with law in implementing the concededly sovereign

487 C-PHB, § 23. The Tribunal notes right from the start that out of the above statements, only the latter relates to
the Respondents’ alleged non-performance obligation, while the Claimants’ focus is clearly on the Respondents’
alleged breach of its “best efforts” obligation.

acts of the Government”, which is not arbitrable under Venezuelan law, as it is

equivalent to challenging the validity of the sovereign act itself.472

Turning to the substance of the claims, the Respondents take the position that the
Willful Breach Claims are “facially absurd” because none of the conditions for
establishing civil liability (i.e., existence of an obligation, breach of the obligation,
fault, damages and causal link) have been met.4”? In that regard, they emphasize that
throughout the proceedings the Claimants have struggled, and ultimately failed, to
identify any express contractual obligations that would have been breached by the
Respondents. At best, the Claimants have come up with an assorted cluster of
provisions to support their theory of the existence of “best efforts” obligations.
However, these arguments are unsustainable, as they have the effect of requiring the
Respondents to defy the law and the Government. The Respondents thus emphasize
that there are no express contractual obligations at the heart of the Claimants’ claim,
and that, in any event, the Respondents have not breached any such purported
contractual obligations.

The Respondents further submit that (i) the actions and omissions relied upon by the
Claimants in support of the Willful Breach Claims were undertaken in compliance with
the 2007 Nationalization Decree, and this precludes any fault and/or ensuing liability
(i.e., the “compliance with law” defense);4” (ii) the Claimants have failed to establish
a causal link between the purported breaches and their loss, which is indispensable
for proving civil liability under Venezuelan law;4”° and (iii) the fact that the Claimants
failed to assert the Willful Breach Claims for a period of 10 years until the initiation of
the present arbitration, constitutes a “disloyal delay” under Venezuelan law which
precludes their right to assert such claims.476

Analysis

In light of the Parties’ positions set out above, the Tribunal considers the following
issues to be the most essential for its decision on the Willful Breach Claims:

472 R-PHB, § 353.
473 R-PHB, § 336.
474 SoD, §§ 250-259; R-PHB, §§ 427-460.

478 SoD, §§ 260-271; R-PHB, §§ 461-474. The Tribunal notes that while the Respondents have treated the
question of their alleged fault and the requirement of a causal link as two separate elements/arguments
concerning civil liabiliy, the Claimants appear to have merged the two elements. The Tribunal's treatment of these
issues is elaborated upon at infra, §§ 443-487.

a. Are the Willful Breach Claims arbitrable?

b. Have the Respondents breached their contractual obligations under the AAs and
the Guarantees? If so, have they done this willfully?

i. Do the Respondents have an obligation to exercise “reasonable commercial
efforts” under the specific provisions of the AAs relied upon by the Claimants?
Has this obligation been breached?

ii. Do the Respondents have an obligation to perform the contracts, and has this
obligation been breached?

c. Is the Respondents’ liability precluded on account of their acts/omissions being “in
compliance with law’?

d. Is the Respondents’ liability precluded due to the absence of a causal link
between the Claimants’ losses and the conduct purportedly constituting a breach
of any obligation?

e. Does the Claimants alleged failure to assert the Willful Breach Claims for a period
of around 10 years preclude them from bringing the claims by reason of their
“disloyal delay”?

The Tribunal now turns to the discussion of each of these issues in turn.
Are the Willful Breach Claims arbitrable?

As a threshold issue, the Respondents have challenged the arbitrability of the Willful
Breach Claims.

The Respondents submit that the Willful Breach Claims at their core only challenge
the implementation of the 2007 Nationalization Decree by virtue of the fact that the
Claimants have only sought damages for the implementation of the 2007
Nationalization Decree and have specifically resisted claiming damages for the
impact of any of the other qualified measures, such as the Royalty Measure, the
Extraction Tax and the Income Tax Increase.47”7 In the Respondents’ view,

477 SoD, §§ 203-204; SoC, fn 467 (“Claimants have adopted a conservative position on damages in relation to the
Willful Breach Claim. In particular, Claimants in this ICC arbitration limit damages for Willful Breach to losses
arising from Respondents’ role in the 2007 dispossession, and do not claim damages for willful breach in relation
to the fiscal measures that preceded the Respondents’ role in the dispossession.”); SoC, fn 616 (“Although it is
likely that Respondents were directly involved in the implementation of those fiscal measures, Claimants are not
pressing those damages under the Willful Breach Claim.”). The Tribunal also notes that according to the
Respondents, the failure to claim damages for the other qualified measures in and of itself demonstrates the

137

305.

306.

challenging the “implementation” of the 2007 Nationalization Decree is effectively the
same as challenging the Decree itself. Considering that the latter is an exercise of
“sovereign authority”, any related claim falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Venezuelan courts and is therefore not arbitrable.

Placing the above facts within legal context, the Respondents rely on Article 151 of
the Venezuelan Constitution, which stipulates that public interest contracts (such as
the AAs) cannot contain clauses providing for the resolution of disputes in foreign
jurisdictions (such as international arbitration) unless this is necessary due to the
nature of the contract.4”® The Respondents’ expert, Prof. Garcia Montoya, explains
that the question of arbitrability of a dispute arising out a public interest contract rests
on the nature of actions underlying the claim being asserted, namely, it is only if the
actions forming the basis of the claim are iure gestionis (as opposed to iure imperii),
that the claim will be arbitrable.*”°

The Respondents also submit that in line with Article 151, the Venezuelan Congress
approved the arbitration clause in the AAs for the purpose of enforcing claims brought
on the basis of the contractual obligations arising pursuant to the DA provisions and
only pursuant to the DA provisions. The arbitration clause was never intended to, nor
could it, cover resolution of any and all claims, including those based on “the
implementation of the very laws that Congress reserved the right to enact’®° as this
would amount to challenging an actum iure imperil. According to the Respondents,
such prohibition against arbitration also extends to the actions of a State company
which is charged with implementing specific acts of the State. The Respondents thus
contend that, as the only actions for which the Willful Breach Claims seek relief is the
implemetation of the 2007 Nationalization Decree, it is squarely based on an actum
iure imperii, and is therefore not arbitrable.4®"

 

Claimants’ own lack of conviction in the merits of their Willful Breach Claims and should lead to their automatic
dismissal (SoD, §§ 203-204; Rejoinder, §§ 214).

For this reason, although the Respondents accept that the Venezuelan Congress
may have authorized the arbitration clauses in the AAs and the Venezuelan Supreme
Court may have affirmed their constitutional validity, they maintain that it is wrong for
the Claimants to interpret these decisions to the effect that they end up “constitut[ing]
a blank check to arbitrate non-commercial disputes and effectively write the
prohibition [against arbitrating claims pertaining to acts jure imperil] [...] out of the
Constitution.”482

In support of their argument, the Respondents also rely on the jurisprudence of the
Venezuelan Supreme Court which has consistently held that arbitration clauses in
public interest contracts must be narrowly construed.*®? On this basis, they submit
that regardless of the broad terms in which the arbitration clauses in the AAs have
been drafted, they must be read narrowly so as to exclude the Willful Breach
Claims.*84

In response to the Respondents’ arguments, the Claimants submit that the
Respondents’ position lacks any merit and that they merely seek to distort the Willful
Breach Claims in order to escape liability. The Claimants oppose the Respondents’
characterization of both the factual basis of the Willful Breach Claims as well as their
interpretation of Article 151 of the Venezuelan Constitution pertaining to arbitrability of
disputes arising out of public interest contracts.

Negating the allegation that the only action forming the basis of the Willful Breach
Claims is the “implementation of the Nationalization Decree”,“®> the Claimants first
clarify that:

[The] Willful Breach Claim is based on Respondents’ failure to perform their
commercial obligations under the AAs and to promote the joint venture.
Chief among the breaches was Respondents’ involvement in procuring the
Nationalization Decree, but what is at issue in these proceedings is not the

validity of that government act, but rather Respondents’ liability for their
own unlawful conduct.

[el

[They] do not ask the Tribunal to evaluate the consititutionality or validity of

sovereign powers of the Venezuelan State, nor to opine on the “implementation

of sovereing decisions”.48°
As regards the Respondents’ interpretation of Article 151, the Claimants contend that
instead of focusing on the actions underlying individual claims and characterizing
these as jure gestionis or iure imperii as the Respondents have done, regard must be
had to the commercial nature of the contract as a whole. Should this interpretation
hold true, then disputes arising out of public interest contracts can be submitted to

arbitration as long as such public interest contracts are commercial in nature.*8”

Tying together the aforementioned factual premise and legal interpretation, the
Claimants’ expert Prof. Brewer Carias explained during his cross-examination that,
while “arbitration cannot refer to matters that are related to the possibility of the State
to adopt imperii acts’, such as imposing a tax or enacting a law, a party can “make a
claim...for damages based on an act iure imperii’. This is because the subject matter
of the challenge is not “the act of the State [or] the power of the State to adopt the
decision”.*8® Rather what is sought to be challenged are the actions undertaken by
the Respondents in a separate and independent commercial capacity (as the
Claimants contractual partner under the AAs), even if these actions are based on or
arise out of the exercise by the State of its separate sovereign power to enact laws.
Accordingly, the Claimants conclude that they seek to challenge PDVSA’s violations
of its own contractual obligations under the AAs — which are commercial in nature —
and therefore the Willful Breach Claims are clearly arbitrable.

To add weight to this interpretation, the Claimants underline that the arbitration
clauses in the AAs were expressly authorized by the Venezuelan Congress*®° for
resolving “[a]ny dispute or claim arising in connection with, [or] relating in any
way to [...] the Association Agreement and/or the Project activity”.4°° Accordingly,
they argue that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the Willful Breach Claims is properly

founded upon the very terms of the arbitration clauses, which are capacious, and
therefore should be interpreted as such.4%"

314. In view of the above, it appears to the Tribunal that the arbitrability of the Willful
Breach Claims hinges on the resolution of the following two issues, to which the
Tribunal turns next: (i) what is the correct legal test for determining arbitrability of
disputes arising out of public interest contracts such as the AAs; and (ii) do the claims
that allegedly give rise to a willful breach in this case satisfy such legal test.

i. What is the legal test for determining arbitrability of disputes arising out of public
interest contracts?

315. In light of the submissions traversed above, it seems to the Tribunal that the Parties
agree that the AAs are public interest contracts and that the issue of arbitrability has
to be decided in light of Article 151 of the Venezuelan Constitution,49? which provides

as follows:

In public interest contracts, unless inapplicable by reason of the nature of such
contracts, a clause shall be deemed included even if not expressed, whereby any
doubts and controversies which may arise concerning such contracts and which
cannot be resolved amicably by the contracting parties, shall be decided by the
competent courts of the Republic, in accordance with its laws and shall not on any

grounds or for any reason give rise to foreign claims.49°
316. Thus, the general rule under Article 151 appears to be that all disputes arising out of
public interest contracts are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the local courts.
However — and as both Parties seem to agree — where the contract is commercial or
industrial in nature, the Congress can grant its authorization for disputes arising out of

such a contract to be submitted to arbitration.4%

317. In a nutshell, the disagreement between the Parties boils down to the legal test that
needs to be applied in order to determine the arbitrability of a particular claim that has
been raised under the AAs, which are admittedly public interest contracts. As
opposed to the Claimants which rely on the nature of the contract as a whole as
being determinative of the arbitrability of the claim, the Respondents focus instead on
the nature of the actions underlying each claim and assert that if the claim challenges
actions undertaken in sovereign as opposed to commercial capacity, it is not

arbitrable. The Respondents maintain that the Willful Breach Claims do not assert any
actions apart from the “implementation of the Nationalization Decree”, which, being
an act jure imperii, is not arbitrable. The Claimants, on the other hand, dispute such
characterization of their claims and underline that they have challenged several
breaches by the Respondents of their own contractual obligations, the
implementation of the 2007 Nationalization Decree being only one of such breaches.

318. The Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondents’ interpretation of arbitrability under
Article 151 of the Venezuelan Constitution. As the Claimants have rightly pointed out,
arbitrability under Article 151 relates to the nature of the contract as a whole. The
Tribunal notes that an exception to the default rule of exclusive jurisdiction over public
interest contracts vesting in the domestic courts is made when the nature of the
contract is commercial. Nothing in the language of Article 151 suggests that regard
must be had to the nature of the actions that underlie the specific claim. For that
matter, by the Respondents’ own admission, Article 151 captures the well known
distinction between acts iure imperii and acts iure gestionis that exists in the law of
sovereign immunity and the resultant principle of restricted jurisdictional immunity.4%
Under this principle, when States behave as commercial actors and enter into
contracts with private entities, they are not entitled to jurisdictional immunity for
disputes arising out of such contracts if the nature of the underlying contract is

commercial.49°

319. Accordingly, in the Tribunal’s view, in order to establish the arbitrability of the Willful
Breach Claims it is sufficient that first, the contract is commercial in nature; and
second, that the disputes giving rise to a willful breach arise out of such commercial
contractual obligations, regardless of the nature of actions that underlie each claim.

modalities of restrictive immunity as follows: “In any event the courts and governments of a number of states
apply the principle of restrictive immunity and therefore it is necessary to examine the modalities of its application.
The method most commonly referred to is the distinction between acts jure imperii (acts of sovereign authority)

The Tribunal thus proceeds to assess whether the facts alleged to give rise to the
Willful Breach Claims satisfy the test set out herein.

ji. Do the Willful Breach Claims satisfy the legal test?

In making this assessment, the Tribunal needs to consider (i) the nature of the
contract and (ii) the facts giving rise to the Willful Breach Claims.

First prong of the legal test: the nature of the contract

Turning to the first requirement of arbitrability of the contract, it is undisputed that the
AAs are commercial in nature.49” In this context, the Tribunal attaches particular
weight to the fact that the Venezuelan Congress specifically authorized the AAs for
both projects — along with the ICC arbitration clauses contained therein — on three
separate occasions:

o On 10 August 1993, the Venezuelan Congress approved the conditions for the
Petrozuata Project, including the ICC arbitration clause by way of the Petrozuata
Congressional Authorization;4%

o On 8 April 1997, the Venezuelan Congress similarly approved the conditions for
the Hamaca Project, including the arbitration clause by way of the First Hamaca
Congressional Authorization; and499

o On 11 June 1997, the Venezuelan Congress approved the final text of the
Hamaca AA itself including the ICC arbitration clause in its present form.5°°

Moreover, in each case, the approved arbitration clauses were worded in the widest
possible terms, covering the resolution of “[a]ny dispute or claim arising in connection
with,” or “relating to,” the Association Agreement and/or the Project activity.°°' The
text of these arbitration clauses attests to the fact that any commercial dispute
anchored in AAs and the Guarantees is arbitrable. The Tribunal has noted the
Respondents’ argument — and the Supreme Court's jurisprudence — that disputes
pertaining to sovereign actions and decisions should not be rendered arbitrable and
pulled into the ambit of the arbitration clause even if the arbitration clause uses broad

324,

language.5°? But this argument is contingent on the Tribunal making a finding that the
Claimants are in fact challenging a sovereign decision as opposed to breaches of
various provisions of the AAs. Therefore this argument relates to the factual scope of
the Willful Breach Claims, namely, the second prong of the test set forth by the
Tribunal above, and will be examined subsequently.®°? The argument does not, in
abstracto, limit the scope of application of an arbitration clause, devoid of the factual
context.

Furthermore, the Tribunal has also noted the Respondents’ argument that the
Congress’ approvals were limited to disputes pertaining to the DA provisions alone
and were intended for enforcing the commercial remedies that were expressly made
available under the AAs against the Governments’ DAs. However, such interpretation
is not borne out by the language of the arbitration clause or that of the HCA or PCA.
Nor can it be reconciled with the Respondents’ position on the criteria to determine
arbitrability, which contradicts their own admission of arbitrability of the DA Claims.
Like the Willful Breach Claims, the DA Claims are also based on the Respondents’
contractual obligations arising pursuant to purported discriminatory actions by the
Government in relation to the Projects. Therefore, both the DA Claims and the Willful
Breach Claims seek damages for the after-effects of a sovereign decision — in this
case the qualified measures and the Expropriation — without challenging the validity
of the Governments’ decisions. Thus, to use the Claimants’ words, which the Tribunal
finds relevant, “[i]f the DA Claim is arbitrable, as Respondents concede, then so too
must be the Willful Breach Claim, for the latter claim is no more ‘sovereign’ in nature
than the former.”

In sum, the Tribunal concludes that the AAs and Guarantees are commercial
contracts and that commercial disputes which may arise in connection with or relating
to contractual obligations under the AAs and the Guarantees are arbitrable. The
Tribunal’s conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the Venezuelan Supreme Court
has also upheld the constitutional validity of analogous arbitration clauses in other
association agreements on the premise that the underlying contract (and not the
claim) was commercial in nature. Once again, the Tribunal has noted the
Respondents’ caveat that the Supreme Court's decision cannot be treated as a blank

check to arbitrate non-commercial disputes. However, this argument too implicates
the second prong of the test set out by the Tribunal, ie. the factual scope of the
Willful Breach Claims, to which the Tribunal turns next.

Second prong of the legal test: facts giving rise to the Willful Breach Claims

325. The Tribunal needs to determine which actions form the basis of the Willful Breach
Claims and whether they give ground to breaches of contractual obligations under the
AAs, or as the Respondents seem to believe, actually constitute a veiled challenge to
a sovereign decision. The Tribunal recalls that the Respondents’ key argument in this
respect is that the only identifiable conduct (of the Respondents) forming the basis of
the Willful Breach Claims is their action of implementing the Government's sovereign
decisions, namely the 2007 Nationalization Decree, and this renders the claims non-
arbitrable.

326. Contrary to the Respondents’ position, the Tribunal finds that the Willful Breach Claim
is more broadly based. The factual premise of the Willful Breach Claims comprises a
chain of inter-connected events that led to the ultimate Expropriation.5° The
implementation of the 2007 Nationalization Decree by the Respondents is but one act
that the Claimants complain about.

327. Thus, as will be elaborated in greater detail below,°°’ the Claimants have argued that
the Respondents were obligated under the AAs and the Guarantees to exercise
reasonable commercial efforts to ensure the success of the Projects and to not act in
a manner that would jeopardize the Claimants’ interest therein as their joint venture
partner. These obligations, according to the Claimants, included the duty to lobby the
Government to ensure that the most favorable tax and royalty regime applied to the
Parties and the Projects and to take decisions that would further the business of the
Project and ensure its continuity. Instead, in the Claimants view, the Respondents
actively collaborated with the Government of Venezuela, they became its
“mouthpiece” and assisted in the development and implementation of the various
steps that brought about the destruction of the AAs and the ultimate expropriation of
the Claimants’ interest in the Projects. According to the Claimants, such active

330.

involvement on the part of the Respondents constitutes a direct violation of their best
efforts obligations under the AAs and their general obligation to act in good faith.5°°

In the circumstances, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Willful Breach Claims comprise
allegations of multiple breaches of the Respondents’ obligations under the AAs and
the Guarantees (and not merely the implementation of the 2007 Nationalization
Decree) and are thus squarely arbitrable. Article 151 of the Venezuelan Constitution

does not limit the arbitrability of claims like the one in the case at hand in any way.

The legal test for establishing the Respondent’s alleged liability as a result of
the Claimants’ Willful Breach Claims

In order to establish the Respondents’ contractual liability for which compensation is
payable, pursuant to Articles 1264 and 1271 of the VCC, the Claimants need to show
that all of the following elements for establishing civil liability are satisfied: (i)
existence of a contractual obligation; (ii) breach of the obligation; (iii) culpable
character of the breach or fault, which is not excused by the intervention of a “non-
attributable external cause”; (iv) resulting damages and (v) a causal link between
the breach and the damages.*’° The Parties appear to agree on the legal test for
establishing civil liability and have addressed each of these elements in their
submissions at length.

With due regard to the legal test for civil liability set out above, the Tribunal will begin
its analysis by first assessing the Parties’ positions with respect to the existence and
the breach of any obligation, i.e., elements (i) and (ii) of the civil liability test
mentioned above. These two elements will first be assessed in the context of the
Claimants’ First Willful Breach Claim, which is based on the Respondents’ alleged
breach of the “reasonable commercial efforts” obligation (Section III.C.3.c of the
Award) and subsequently in the context of the Claimants’ Second Willful Breach
Claim, which is based on the Respondents’ alleged non-performance of the AAs
(Section III.C.3.d of the Award). Thereafter, Section III.C.3.e will address the
defenses raised by the Respondents to preclude their liability for any purported
breaches, which are based on elements (iii) and (v) of the civil liability test. In this

508 Supra, §§ 296.

509 The Tribunal notes that the Parties have taken different positions on which aspect of the civil liability test “non-
attributable external cause” relates to. For the Claimants, it relates to the element of fault (i.e., element (iii) of the
test). For the Respondents, it relates to the element of causation (i.e., element (v) of the test). The Tribunal
addresses these arguments at infra, §§ 443-454.

regard, the Tribunal will address the Parties’ arguments as to whether the
Respondents are exonerated from liability due to the 2007 Nationalization Decree —
on the basis of which the Expropriation took place —being external to the
Respondents and therefore not constituting either the factually or the legally sufficient
cause for the Claimants’ loss. Lastly, in light of the Tribunal’s assessment of the
above four elements, the Tribunal will make its determination on damages, if any
(element (iv) of the civil liability test).

First Willful Breach Claim: the existence and breach, if any, of the

Re cial efforts” igation (i.e., (i) and

(ii) of the civil liability test)
i. _The Claimants’ Position

The relevant contractual provisions

As to the first two elements of civil liability, ie. the existence of an obligation and its
breach, the Claimants argue that the Respondents were expressly obligated to use
“all reasonable commercial efforts” to “assure the success of the Projects” pursuant to
Sections 2.04(a), 9.01(b) and Preambular clauses 6 and 10 of the Petrozuata AA, as
well as Articles 2.1(a), 10.4(a) and 10.5(a) of the Hamaca AA. As will be elaborated in
greater detail below, the Claimants contend that the Respondents have breached this
contractual obligation because the “Respondents themselves played a key role in the
campaign of destruction of the Association Agreements from which they — above all —
benefitted”.5""

The Tribunal recalls that according to the Claimants the scope of the Respondents’
“reasonable commercial efforts” obligation is informed by (i) the text of the AAs and
the Guarantees; (ii) the context in which these contracts were entered into; and (iii)
the duty of good faith set forth in Article 1160 of the VCC.5'2

The Tribunal will examine each of the Claimants’ above assertions in more detail.

First, the Claimants submit that the plain text of the AAs and Guarantees obligated
the Respondents to promote the success of the Projects through the use of “best
efforts” or “reasonable commercial efforts”.

335. With respect to the Petrozuata AA, they rely on Sections 2 and 9, which state in the
relevant parts as follows:

Section 2.04(a)

In order to accomplish and give effect to this Agreement, each Party covenants and
agrees to vote, or cause to be voted, the Shares owned by it in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement. Each Party also covenants and agrees that
it will at all times act, take all such steps as may be reasonably within its power
and use reasonable commercial efforts to cause [Petrozuata C.A.] to act in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the other Business
Contracts. Accordingly, the Parties hereby commit themselves to contribute their
Ownership Percentage shares of the investments necessary to construct the
upgrading facility and to produce and transport the Extra-Heavy Oil needed to supply
said upgrading facility as set forth in the description of the Project attached as Exhibit
“F” and made a part hereof, and any modification thereto duly agreed by the
Parties.5S

Section 9.01(b)

The Parties will cause [Petrozuata C.A.] to conduct its operations in accordance
with its Charter, in order to implement the Business Contracts, the Investment
and Business Plan and the Annual Work Program and Budget for [Petrozuata C.A.]
as in effect from time to time. Each of the Parties also agrees that at all times it will
vote, act, take all steps reasonably necessary and use all reasonable
commercial efforts to carry out and assure the success of the Project. The
operations of [Petrozuata C.A.] shall be carried out in accordance with, and subject to
all laws applicable thereto and be so conducted as to avoid the application of any
penalty, sanction or loss thereunder to [Petrozuata C.A.]. None of the Parties will
take any action not contemplated herein that may adversely affect the
performance by [Petrozuata C.A.] of its obligations under its Charter or under
any Business Contract.54

 

336. The Claimants submit that these obligations are reinforced by the covenants in the
Preamble of the Petrozuata AA, which reads in the relevant parts as follows:

Clause 6

The Parties wish to enter into this Association Agreement for the purpose of (i)
establishing, operating and owning [Petrozuata C.A.] in Venezuela, (ii) carrying
out the transactions contemplated in the Business Contracts and (iii) [taking all
other steps] [carrying out all other activities}>'* reasonably necessary to
implement and develop the Project.

Upgraded Crude Oil and by-products, in accordance with the said Investment
and Business Plan.5"°

337. Turning to the Hamaca AA, the Claimants rely on the following provisions:

Article 2.1(b)

It is the intention and plan of the Parties to this Agreement that all Project
activities be conducted in a safe manner preserving the environment in
accordance with applicable law and so as to make the best economic
utilization of Project resources and assets to achieve the maximum
benefit for the Project and the Parties in their capacity as participants in
the Association.*"”

Article 10.4(a)

The Parties shall use their best efforts, in accordance with Venezuelan law, to
obtain, within sixty (60) days of the date of this Agreement, a favorable royalty
regime for the Project and to have such regime, including (i) the Fiscalization
Point, (ii) a mechanism for determining the royalty rate payable on Extra-Heavy
Oil produced by the Parties in their capacity as participants in the Association
and (iii) a mechanism for determining the value of Extra-Heavy Oil at the
Fiscalization Point, evidenced in an agreement with the relevant governmental
authorities. The Parties shall use their best efforts to maintain at all times
application to the Parties, in their capacity as pai pants in the
Association, of the most favorable royalty regime permitted by law, taking
into account the existing legal regime and the economics of the Project, as such
factors may change from time to time. All formal approaches to, and
meetings with, Venezuelan governmental authorities to establish such
items shall be directed by the [Corpoguanipal], provided that [Corpoguanipa]
shall provide timely prior notice of each such approach or meeting to each
Foreign Party and any Foreign Party, upon its request, may participate in such
approach or meeting.°"®

 

Article 10.5(a)

The Parties are undertaking the Project on the basis that, in accordance with
the Conditions, (i) all activities conducted by the Parties in their capacity as
participants in the Association, and all Project activities conducted by the
Association Entities, shall receive the treatment provided for in the sole
paragraph of Article 9 of the Venezuelan Income Tax Law and (ii) the Project
activities, as conducted by the Parties and the Association Entities, shall not be
subject to taxation by municipalities (patente de industria y comercio) or states.
The Parties shall use their best efforts such that there will be applicable to
the Parties at all times, in their capacity as participants in the Association,
the most favorable tax regime permitted by law, taking into account the
existing legal regime and the economics of the Project, as such factors may
change from time to time.5"9

338. Similarly under the Guarantees, the Claimants submit that PDVSA unconditionally
guaranteed that it will “perform, or cause to be performed, each and every one of”,

the obligations and duties of the PDVSA Subsidiaries under the AAs.5*° Therefore,
according to the Claimants, PDVSA was equally obligated to ensure performance of

the aforementioned obligations under the AAs.

339. Second, the Claimants submit that the abovementioned contractual obligations must
be understood in light of the long term commitments made by the Respondents as
part of the Apertura Petrolera. |n particular, the Apertura Petrolera sought to attract
foreign investment in the EHCO projects, first by reassuring investors that their
investments would not be subjected to sudden nationalization as had occurred in
1975, pursuant to the 1975 Nationalization Law;521 and second, by providing key
incentives and protections against technical and commercial risks. Given this
backdrop, the Claimants emphasize that it was incumbent upon the Respondents to
act as “any co-venturers would have...in an undertaking of the size, risk, and length
of the Associations”? and to protect the Projects against detrimental Government

measures.°23

340. The Claimants thus submit that the cumulative effect of the above express
contractual obligations, along with the context in which the AAs and Guarantees were
entered into, is to impose upon the Respondents an obligation “to promote and
protect these long-term Projects, as well as [a] duty of performance under Articles
1264 and 1271 of the VCC."54

341. Third, the Claimants submit that the contours of the Respondents’ obligations are
clarified by Article 1160 of the VCC which stipulates that “[c]ontracts must be
performed in good faith, and are binding [on the parties] not only with respect to what
is expressed therein, but also with regard to all the consequences arising therefrom,

21 The 1975 Nationalization Law was enacted on 29 August 1975 under a constitutional mandate which permitted
the State to reserve certain industries, exploitations for reasons of national interest. Pursuant thereto, all activities
related to the exploration and exploitation of oil were “reserved to the State’. PDVSA was created pursuant to this
law. Article 5 provided for limited private participation in the oil industry through association agreements between
PDVSA and private entities. The Claimants contend that the 1975 Nationalization Law immediately cancelled all
existing oil concessions in Venezuela and reserved to the State all activities relating to exploration, exploitation,
manufacturing, refining, and marketing of petroleum and petroleum by-products. Moreover the Government
provided only partial compensation to the private international oil companies whose projects and rights were
expropriated. According to the Claimants, this reduced faith amongst investors. Consequently, when Venezuela
sought to attract investors to invest in the EHCO projects, PDVSA allegedly provided reassurances against the
possibility of sudden and under-compensated nationalization. See SoC, pp 15 — 38; Organic Law that Reserves to
the State the Industry and Trade of Hydrocarbons, Extraordinary Official Gazette No.1.769, published on 29
August 1975, R-278.

according to equity, custom, or the Law.” The Claimants’ expert, Prof. Mata Borjas
explained during the Hearing that “the commitments and the duty of good faith [in the
context of] a [long-term and collaborative] joint venture between two Parties for a very
specific purpose [such as the Projects] [...] is differentS?® in that it “entails loyalty,
cooperation and an honest behaviour that ensures that the other party’s legitimate
expectations will be satisfied”.5?’ It also implies a duty to refrain from conduct that
impedes or frustrates the contractual interest of and/or results in a disadvantage or
detriment to the counter-party.5?° On this basis, the Claimants submit that:

The obligation of good faith under Venezuelan law requir[ed] Respondents to
honor the objective expectations of Claimants as their contracting partners and
to cooperate with Claimants to accomplish the long-term purposes of the AAs
and Guarantees [...] Indeed, various provisions of the AAs expressly refer to
“good faith,” and this basic principle of Venezuelan law served as the backdrop
against which Claimants and Respondents made the agreements that they
did.529

The Respondents’ actions that allegedly breach the “reasonable commercial
efforts” obligation under the AAs and the Guarantees

Turning to the facts, the Claimants submit that through the following actions and/or
chain of events, the Respondents played a key role in the destruction of the AAs and
the Projects, thereby breaching their contractual obligation to exercise “reasonable
commercial efforts”:

The transformation of the “old PDVSA” into the “new PDVSA’” and the role
played by key officials of the PDVSA in the Overall Expropriation;

2) The Respondents’ failure to object to the qualified public measures i.e. the
Royalty Increase, the Extraction Tax and the Income Tax Increase;

2

The Respondents’ role in confiscating the Claimants’ Project interests; and

2

Links between the Respondents and the Government.

(1) The transformation of the “old PDVSA” into the “new PDVSA” and the role
played by key PDVSA officials
According to the Claimants, the first step in the Respondents’ campaign of
destruction was the transformation of Respondent PDVSA. As noted by the
Claimants’ expert, Prof. Mares, in 2003 the technocratic and autonomous “old
PDVSA’ underwent a fundamental transformation. Around 18,000 PDVSA employees
were removed and replaced with managers and directors that sympathized and
complied with the policies and programs of the Chavez administration. Thus, a
political and subservient “new PDVSA” emerged, which functioned simultaneously “as
an operating company, development agency, political tool and government cash

cow” 530

The Claimants allege that the new PDVSA not only complied with the State
measures/policy that led to the Expropriation, but played a critical role in creating
such policy. The focus of this ‘new PDVSA’ was to “get working...as an operating,
auxiliary arm of... the Ministry”,5°' dismantling the Apertura Petrolera and restoring
“Full Oil Sovereignty”.552

The complicity of the “new PDVSA’ was allegedly channeled through PDVSA officials
such as Messrs. Ramirez, Rodriguez and Del Pino and Dr. Mommer. According to
the Claimants, by virtue of their roles as President and/or Directors of PDVSA these
individuals were legally bound to promote and protect the Projects. However, the
Claimants submit that

All of these individuals, who led the Respondents during the relevant period
(2004 to 2007), were ideologically opposed to the Apertura, the AAs and the
Guarantees, and they set about — and indeed succeeded in — destroying them.
These individuals refused to protect the Projects from the measures that
deprived Claimants of the royalty and tax regime that had been adopted to
induce their vast investment in the Orinoco Oil Belt. And once the Projects were
at a stage where PDVSA was theoretically able to take over operations on its
own, Respondents, for reasons of politics and money, actively promoted their
nationalization.593

Turning to the role played by each of the above named officials, the Claimants make
the following allegations:

e Mr. Ramirez was the personification of the “new PDVSA”. From November 2004,
he acted as both President of PDVSA as well as Minister of Energy and Mines.
Crucially, the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of PDVSA — which had
previously stipulated a separation between the Government and the management
of PDVSA - were specially amended to allow Mr. Ramirez to serve in both of
these capacities.5°4 This unique “dual role” allowed Mr. Ramirez to implement the
objective of giving PDVSA control over the AAs: He “[...] (as PDVSA President)
submit[ted] decisions to himself (as energy minister) for shareholder approval”
and was heavily relied on by President Chavez to both formulate and carry out oil
policy.§*° According to the Claimants it is inconceivable that Mr. Ramirez would
have been able to maintain the division in his mind between the “dual hats” he

wore.

e In addition, Mr. Ramirez was personally involved in the drafting and promulgation
of the 2007 Nationalization Decree. The Claimants’ expert, Prof. Brewer Carias,
attested to the fact that “as a matter of Venezuelan law and practice, Mr. Ramirez
would have been legally obligated to present, endorse, and promote the
Nationalization Decree to secure its enactment."53° Moreover, the Respondents’
expert, Prof. Garcia Montoya, also confirmed that “the one that formulates the
policy in a given field is the Ministry, in this case Minister Ramirez — [which] he
has to provide to the President in the Council of Ministers, and there is where it is

of law they exercise authority.” | must say that the word in Spanish is—they exercise “rectoria,” the fut
authority on the matters of their own at

the National Executive in the definition of the policies and the execution of the p s of he
Government. They have to present the matters before the President. They have to present the matters
before the Council of Ministers, and ... according to Article 86 of the Law, the procedure for preparing this
draft legislation, as it’s said in this Article, “will begin in the competent Ministry or Ministries preparing
the corresponding draft.” The Ministers are the ones, therefore, that have to draft the draft legislation.
They have to propose it before the Council of Ministers. “The Head of the Ministry proposing the draft,”
as it says in the Article, “must submit to the Council of Ministers the matter,” and then, according to what
the Council of Ministers could decide, they have to follow up the decisions and resubmit the matter to the
Council of Ministers in order for it to be adopted as a Decree-Law if it is the case of the legislation or be sent
to the National Assembly for the sanctioning by the National Assembly. So, the Ministers are the key persons
responsible of the drafting and the defending these acts before the Council of Ministers.) (emphasis added)

approved.”5°” Thus, according to the Claimants, the Government could not have
issued the 2007 Nationalization Decree without Mr. Ramirez’s active participation.

Mr. Rodriguez, Mr. Ramirez's predecessor as PDVSA’s president, co-authored
the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law which formed the basis of the qualified public
measures that were enacted against the Projects. The Claimants’ expert, Prof.
Mares, notes that the decision to abrogate the Royalty Reduction Agreement
(pursuant to which the royalty rate applicable to the EHCO Projects had been
reduced from the ordinarily applicable 16.66% to 1%) was linked to Mr.
Rodriguez's criticisms of the Apertura Petrolera and his staunch support for “full

oil sovereignty”.

Mr. Del Pino played an instrumental role in the forced “migration” of the Projects
from private ownership to PDVSA pursuant to the 2007 Nationalization Decree.
He subsequently represented PDVSA in the negotiations between Conoco and
the Government in 2007 in relation to the Expropriation. He eventually succeeded
Mr. Ramirez in the dual role of PDVSA President and the Minister of Energy and
Mines.5°9

Dr. Mommer was another oil nationalist who worked closely with Mr. Ramirez and
Mr. Rodriguez, and also held dual positions — as Vice Minister of Hydrocarbons
and as a Director on the Board of PDVSA. Moreover, as he confirmed at the
Hearing, he was an outspoken critic of the Apertura Petrolera and the Association
Agreements,*° and played a personal role in “conceptualiz[ing] and promotfing]
each of the fiscal measures preceeding the final dispossession of the Claimants’

interests in the Projects” namely, the qualified measures.*41

The Respondents’ failure to use “best efforts” to resist the qualified measures

The Claimants submit that the Respondents breached their contractual obligations by
failing to resist the changes being made by the Government to the fiscal regime
applicable to the Projects. The Claimants maintain that the Respondents had

assumed the obligation to use “reasonable commercial efforts” to ensure that the

most favorable fiscal regimes applied to the Projects, only because they were
purportedly in a position to influence the Government in relation to its policies.54?
Consequently, it fell upon the Respondents to act in good faith and protest and/or
lobby against measures such as the Income Tax Increase, the Royalty Measure and
the Extraction Tax. Instead, the PDVSA officials not only eschewed any attempts to
engage with the Government, but they in fact “played a significant role in developing
and promoting these measures.”543

349. For instance, the Claimants draw attention to Dr. Mommer’s affirmation during the
Hearing that he “conceptualized and promoted” each of the qualified measures;544
and that he did so when he was not even part of the Government, but employed
solely as a Managing Director of a PDVSA subsidiary. Moreover, during the Hearing,
Dr. Mommer went so far as to say that “it would be absolutely absurd [for the
Claimants] to go to PdV” to seek protection from the qualified measures or the
Expropriation.*° This, they say, goes to show that Dr. Mommer was acting in clear
breach of his duty of good faith and loyalty towards PDVSA’s joint venture partners
under the AAs.*4° Similarly, Mr. Ramirez, acting in his capacity as the Minister, was
responsible for imposing the Royalty Measure upon the AAs.” Finally, the Claimants
also contend that the same PDVSA officials were equally responsible for getting the
Board of Directors of the Projects to approve each of the qualified measures when
they were enacted.54*

(3) The Respondents’ role in the confiscation of the Claimants’ interest in the
Projects

350. The Claimants assert that the Respondents played an active and integral role in the
destruction of the Projects and a decisive role in the Expropriation.

They submit that contrary to the Respondents’ insistence that the Expropriation was
solely President Chavez’s “brainchild”, public speeches by PDVSA officials in 2005
and 2006 clearly show that the Respondents were equally responsible for its
conceptualization. The Claimants cite the following instances, among others:

e In May 2005, Mr. Ramirez presented a complaint against purported irregularities
in the various association agreements that had been concluded with foreign
investors pursuant to the Apertura Petrolera, to the relevant Government
authorities established for this purpose. Therein he described the policy of Full Oil

Sovereignty which included “the nationalization of the oil industry”.549

e Around the same time, Mr. Ramirez delivered a speech before the Venezuelan
National Assembly wherein he severely criticized the Apertura Petrolera as a
“veritable assault on Venezuelan oil” and the ‘old PDVSA’ as “quintessentially
anti-national”.55° Importantly, these ideas were being articulated at a time when
Mr. Ramirez had taken up his role as President of the “new PDVSA’”.

e On 18 August 2005, in a speech “to the nation and [...] the world”, President
Chavez announced that the Government and PDVSA were “reversing the
[Apertura Petrolera] through the Plan Siembra Petrolera’' namely, the plan to
recover control over oil through the nationalization of the association agreements.
In the same speech, President Chavez attested to the fact that this Plan “came
out of PDVSA [and] was developed in PDVSA."552

e On 19 August 2005, Mr. Ramirez delivered his own speech regarding the Plan
Siembra Petrolera, affirming that its objective was to “recover and renationalize
the oil production.”

e On 20 October 2005, in a public statement at an OPEC conference, Mr. Ramirez
stated that “[Wle are willing to use all the strength of the new PDVSA and the
Venezuelan State to capture the oil rent for the benefit of our people [...] Our task

to [...] place [oil] in the hands of the Venezuelan State.”554

e In March 2006, in a televised interview, Mr. Ramirez declared that “[T]he defeat of
the oil sabotage [...] has allowed us to control [PDVSA]. Now, it is directed by the
Venezuelan State and now, it will allow us to dismantle the [Apertura
Petrolera]’ >

e In August 2006, Dr. Mommer informed the Claimants that they would have to
accept the conversion/migration of the associations into empresas mixtas (mixed
companies) with the Government's participation at 51% .55°

In sum, the Claimants maintain that the above evidence unequivocally attests to the
Respondents’ integral involvement in the process leading up to the promulgation of
the 2007 Nationalization Decree, their role in the development of the Plan Siembra
Petrolera and their open hostility to the Apertura Petrolera and the AAs.5°”

Furthermore, the Claimants submit that in the aftermath of the 2007 Nationalization
Decree, the Respondents played a key role in ensuring that the Claimants were
dispossessed of their interest in the Projects. PDVSA officials, specifically Mr. Del
Pino, allegedly “threatened” the Claimants to accept migration to the mixed
enterprises regime (empresas mixtas), failing which full operation and control over the
Projects would be transferred to PDVSA. Consistent with these threats, at midnight
on 1 May 2007, PDVSA took control of the Projects. Following such dispossession,
throughout June — July 2007, Mr. Ramirez and President Chavez publicly
acknowledged the role that PDVSA had played in the migration process and in
acquiring control over the hydrocarbon production business in the Orinoco Oil Belt.55°
Pertinently, Mr. Ramirez acknowledged that “only by getting PDVSA to work as a

subordinate to the State and for the State, [did] the Bolivarian Government manage
[...] to dismantle the Apertura Petrolera’>®® of which the AAs were a part.

According to the Claimants, the Respondents’ actions were motivated by pure
profiteering considerations as they derived extraordinary benefits from destroying the
AAs. The revenues that the Respondents derived from the qualified measures helped
PDVSA to defray its financial obligations towards the Government's new
political/social programs. After the Respondents acquired the Projects in 2007, all of
the revenues from the Projects were deployed to discharge their financial obligations

towards Government spending.
(4) Additional links between the Ministry and the ‘new PDVSA’

Lastly, the Claimants mention four additional links between the Ministry and the ‘new
PDVSA’, which they submit show the ‘new PDVSA’s’ involvement in procuring the
Expropriation: first, as admitted by Dr. Mommer during the Hearing, the salaries of “all
directors of the Ministry were paid by PdVSA”®' implying that both entities had
access to the same pool of resources; second, again as Dr. Mommer confirmed
during the Hearing, the Respondents and the Government (namely, the Ministry)
were being advised by the same legal counsel in relation to the Expropriation;®® third,
PDVSA and the Government worked together to value the Projects both before and
after the Expropriation. In fact, Mr. Del Pino was heavily involved in the post-
Expropriation compensation negotiations with the Claimants even though at the time,
he had no ministerial role; and fourth, at the time of the Expropriation, the Ministry

and PDVSA occupied the same office complex.5®

The Claimants consider it rather surprising that there are next to no records
documenting the above interactions between the Respondents and the Government.
They conclude that this can only mean that the documents are missing or that the
Respondents are refusing to produce them. Accordingly, they have also asked the

Tribunal to draw adverse inferences against the Respondents.5**

ji. The Respondents’ Position

357. The Respondents consider the claims asserted on the basis of the above express
contractual provisions®®> “difficult to decipher” and “a collosal waste of everyone's
time”.5®° They point out that the “Claimants have been making [up the Willful Breach
Claims] on the fly’.°°” Insofar as the Claimants now allege a willful breach of the
abovementioned “potpourri” of contractual provisions, they point out that the
Claimants invented these claims for the first time in their SoC.5®° Up until that point,
the Claimants were only asserting a rather nebulous and grossly exaggerated claim
for “violation of the general [contractual] obligation of good faith” and for “tortious
interference” with the AAs.5*° The Respondents take this “confusion in Claimants’
case” as proof of the fact that the contractual provisions relied upon are completely
irrelevant and consequently that the Willful Breach Claims are entirely devoid of any
substance.” As far as the duty to act in good faith under Article 1160 of the VCC is
concerned, the Respondents contend that the Claimants misapply the principle and
attempt to create new contractual obligations that do not exist under the AAs.

358. Thus, the Respondents first argue that the contractual provisions relied upon by the
Claimants are incapable of giving rise to any obligations at all, such that the question
of breach does not even arise. Second, in the event any obligations do arise, the
Respondents refute the Claimants’ factual allegations in order to establish that there
is no breach.

normally think that, if the Parties to an agreement anticipate the possibility of certain events occurring and
carefully negotiate what is to happen, exactly what is to happen when those events occurred, there is no reason
or room for resorting to creative theories such as good faith or tortious interference. In other words, the very
existence of this second category of claims is a good indication of how silly the first category is. So, the question
is--and I'm sure you must be asking yourself this question--why did it take them seven years to claim
compensation [for willful breach]? By seven years now, I'm measuring from the nationalization in 2007, not from
the first event, which was 2004. That's over ten years. Why did it take them so long to claim compensation of the
compensation provisions of the Association Agreements?”); Tr. (First Session), 15:17-16:7 (Claimants’ Statement)
(Claimants’ Counsel: “But the role of the Respondents themselves in the Measures takes us beyond the passive
no-fault partial indemnification mechanism of the Discriminatory Action Provisions. We thus focus on the active
conduct of the its in ing in the ion of the A: and we see two
things: First, a willful breach of their obligations under the Association ‘Agreements, which include the duty of good
faith and fair dealing; or putting it in the alternative way, (2) interference by the Respondents in the performance
of the Association Agreements, interference that, under Venezuelan law, constitutes an “hecho ilicito,” which in
French might be rendered as “délits” or in English, perhaps, as “tortious interference.” These breaches entitled the
Claimants to compensation for their actual damages suffered amounting to tens of billions of dollars.”)

The Respondents’ position on whether the provisions of the AAs entail an an
obligation to exercise “reasonable commercial efforts”

The Respondents start by pointing out that throughout these proceedings, neither the
Claimants nor their experts have had a clear idea as to the specific contractual
obligations that have been breached. They state that it was only in the SoC that the
Claimants first identified an “odd assortment of irrelevant recitals and clauses of the
[AAs]” which they claimed were purportedly breached.5”'

Turning to this “odd assortment of [...] recitals and clauses”, the Respondents argue
that under Articles 1264 and 1271 of the VCC, a fundamental requirement for civil
liability to arise is the existence of an “obligation” which has been breached.‘’? Their
expert, Prof. Garcia Montoya, explained during the Hearing that under Venezuelan
law in order to support a claim for breach of contract it was necessary to prove
specific acts, demonstrate how these acts violated contractual obligations and
establish the causal link between the said acts and any incurred damage. In his view,
the “type of general allegations made by Claimants” and the “odd assortment of [...]

recitals and clauses” did not meet these requirements.5”>

The Respondents then proceed to analyze each provision of the AAs relied upon by
the Claimants>’4 and demonstrate how these do not give rise to any specific
obligations that can support the Willful Breach Claims:

e With regard to Clauses 6 and 10 of the Preamble to the Petrozuata AA®”®, the
Respondents contend that the Claimants have not “explained what obligation they
thought was created by the[se] preambular clause[s]...nor explain[ed] how such a

purported obligation could have been breached.”5’6

e With regard to Clause 2.04(a) of the Petrozuata AA®”’, the Respondents contend
that the clause is irrelevant, first because the voting patterns it seeks to regulate is

971 See R-PHB, §§ 354-362.

872 VCC, RLA-148, Article 1264 (“Obligations must be complied with exactly as they have been subscribed. The
debtor is liable for damages in case of breach.” (emphasis added by Respondents)); Article 1271 (“The debtor
shall be ordered to pay damages for non-performance of the obligation or for delay in performance, unless he
proves that the non-performance or the delay arises from a non-imputable external cause, even if he did not act in
bad faith.” (emphasis added)).

not under dispute and second because in line with the clause, the Respondents
have never caused the Petrozuata C.A. to not act in accordance with the

provisions of the Petrozuata AA or other contracts.

e With regard to Clause 9.01(b) of the Petrozuata AA®’®, the Respondents argue
that while this clause undoubtedly calls upon both shareholders to “take all steps
necessary and use all reasonable commercial efforts to carry out and assure the
success of the Project”, it does not imply that the Respondents may violate the
law or overthrow the Government in the process. To further support their
argument they point to the fact that Clause 9.01(b) itself stipulates that the
“operations of the [Petrozuata C.A.] shall be carried out in accordance with, and

subject to all laws applicable.”579

e With regard to Article 2.1(b) of the Hamaca AA®®°, the Respondents point out that
this clause is entirely irrelevant and does not translate into the sweeping
obligations the Claimants posit as the basis for their claims. In particular, the
dispute does not concern the Parties’ intention to conduct the Project activities “in
a safe manner preserving the environment” or “[ensuring] best economic
utilisation of Project resources and assets.”5*'

e With regard to Article 10.4(a) and 10.5(a) of the Hamaca AA®®?, which require the
use of best efforts to maintain the application of the most favorable royalty and tax
regimes respectively, the Respondents argue that to start with, the Claimants
have disavowed making any claim for willful breach on the basis of the Royalty
Measure or the Extraction Tax, and that in any event, both clauses subjected the
use of “best efforts” to the existing legal regime which would undoubtedly change
from time to time.5®

In sum, the Respondents conclude that the specific clauses of the AAs relied upon by
the Claimants are not in the nature of stabilization clauses and most certainly do not
and could not guarantee that the Apertura Petrolera would last forever. By the same
token, these clauses do not curb the Government's abilities to enact measures that

will affect the Projects or require the Respondents to disregard such measures. As
such, in the Respondents’ view, the Claimants have failed to discharge their burden
to prove the existence of any express contractual obligations under the AAs and

Venezuelan law.5&4

363. The Respondents further contend that, in any event, Venezuelan law does not
sustain the conclusions that the Claimants seek to posit because all of the so-called
obligations cited by the Claimants are at best “obligations of means” and not
“obligations of result’. The Respondents’ expert, Prof. Garcia Montoya, explains that
“[o]bligations of result are those where the performance promised by the debtor is a
specific, precise and concrete effect of the obligor’s activity; the performance is an
end in itself, since the debtor agrees to obtain a specific result.’5°° On the other hand,
due to the non-predictable nature of the desired result, obligations of means involve
at best a promise to act with diligence and to behave prudently so as to try to achieve
the desired result.5°

364. The Respondents emphasize that the above distinction is significant from the point of
view of Venezuelan law, inasmuch as Article 1271 of the VCC — which has been
relied upon by the Claimants as giving rise to the Respondents’ liability — only applies
to an obligation of result and raises a presumption of breach. However, in case of
obligations of means, there is no such presumption and the Claimants have the
burden to establish the Respondents’ breach.®8” In this respect, the Respondents
underline that all the obligations cited by the Claimants are “best efforts” obligations
and thus clearly obligations of means; that it is thus for the Claimants to prove that
the Respondents have failed to discharge their obligations; and that the Claimants
have failed to discharge this burden.

promises to transport something from one place to another, to deliver something, to perform a work contract,

of the desired result, the debtor promises only his diligence, a vigorous, attentive conduct to anticipate possible
obstacles and to try to overcome them, but there the only thing that the debtor can really promise is this prudent
and careful behavior. This is the case of the obligation of a doctor to cure the patient, or the lawyer to assist his

365. Regarding the Claimants’ allegations on the context in which the AAs were executed,
the Respondents’ counterargument is that the Claimants fully understood at the time
of making the investment that Government policies were subject to change and that
the Government was free to enact measures that would affect the economics of the
Projects. In fact, far from expecting a stable legal and political environment, the
Claimants fully foresaw, understood and expected changes, especially in the event of
exceptionally high oil prices. It is for this reason, the Respondents assert, that the
Claimants insisted on negotiating very precise remedies — the indemnity against DAs
— to mitigate these risks.5** In the Respondents’ view, this is the true context in which
the AAs were negotiated and not under some false belief that the Apertura Petrolera

would be resistant to any change.

366. As to the Claimants’ reliance on good faith under Article 1160 of the VCC, the
Respondents first submit that the contours of the duty to perform contracts in good
faith under Venezuelan law clearly indicate that this duty is of very limited scope: it
only allows the judge to sanction the disloyal use of a contractual prerogative and not
to impair the very substance of the rights and obligations agreed upon by the
parties.5°° Relying on legal scholarship, the Respondents explain that while an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is recognized in most contracts, “the
principle of sanctity of contracts means that the parties cannot avoid their duty to
perform the contract exactly as it was subscribed.”5°° Put differently, any purported
duty of good faith cannot be used like a “magic wand”5%' to conjure contractual

obligations where none previously existed, in an attempt to re-write a contract.5%

367. In light of the above, the Respondents submit that the Willful Breach Claims are
without basis, because (i) the Claimants have not identified any relevant express
contractual obligations that the Respondents have breached, much less performed in
bad faith; and (ii) Respondents do not have an obligation to prevent the Government

from rightfully exercising sovereign powers. Instead, turning the Claimants’ argument
against them, the Respondents argue that the Claimants’ Willful Breach Claims are
an exercise of bad faith as they circumvent the compensation provisions of the AAs
which were specifically negotiated to provide relief against acts like the
Expropriation.5%

368. Turning to the Claimants’ factual allegations, the Respondents dismiss these as

“unfocused and inaccurate”.5%

369. The Respondents state that the Claimants’ attempts to distinguish between so called
“old” and “new” PDVSA and their allegation that it functioned as a political tool and
government cash cow, disregards reality. From its very formation in 1975, PDVSA
was “obligated to comply with and implement policy in matters of hydrocarbons that
the National Executive establish[ed] through the Ministry of Energy and Mines”;5° it
was governed by the provisions adopted by the National Executive;5°° and in carrying
out its corporate functions, PDVSA was required to abide by the guidelines and
policies established by the National Executive and the Ministry of Energy and
Mines.597

370. The Respondents further submit that although the Claimants have emphasized the
alleged “dual hat” worn by key PDVSA officials and the implications this has for the
Respondents’ purported role in the Claimants’ dispossession, the fact remains that
such allegations have no legal basis. The Respondents emphasize that (i) each of
PDVSA and the PDVSA Subsidiaries are separate legal entities from the

Government; and (ii) there is no legal principle that allows the Claimants to attribute to
the Respondents (State-entities), liability for the actions of the Government merely
because one or more government officials also serve as an officer or director of the
State entity.5%° They argue that in fact the presence of government officials on the
board of national oil companies (“NOC”) is far from unusual and there is no reason to
single out PDVSA.5% More importantly, merely because a State official also sits on
the board of a NOC does not mean that his actions in State capacity are transformed
into those of the NOC. To this the Respondents add that the “entire story of the dual
roles of Mr. Ramirez and Dr. Mommer is nothing more than an_ irrelevant
distraction”,®°° because the course of events would have remained the same (i.e. the
Overall Expropriation would have occurred and PDVSA would have to implement the
decisions of the Government) even if other individuals — and completely independent
individuals — had been at the helm of PDVSA.

Next, as regards the allegation that they played a key role in the campaign that
destroyed the AAs through the development of the Plan Siembra Petrolera, the
Respondents deem these statements “ridiculous”.®°' The Respondents contend that
the Plan Siembra Petrolera is not a “timeline expressly referring to the qualified
measures and the migration as integrated steps” for the ultimate objective of
destroying the AAs.°? Much to the contrary, this Plan had nothing to do with the AAs
and is an actual corporate plan to contribute to national socio-economic development,
to leverage the Government's social policies, develop the Orinoco Oil Belt, and
achieve other objectives that will contribute to the integrated development of oil
production and the Venezuelan society.°° Thus, while the Plan is undoubtedly
aligned with national policy, it is otherwise entirely unrelated to the AAs and therefore
not a subject matter in dispute in the current proceedings.

Having thus elaborated the Parties’ positions on law and facts, the Tribunal
commences its analysis of these submissions below.

3.1. Do the express contractual provisions relied upon by the Claimants
give rise to any obligations and what is the nature of such obligations
(element (i) of the civil liability test)?
In light of the Parties’ submissions, the starting point of the Tribunal’s analysis is to
determine whether the express contractual provisions cited by the Claimants indeed

give rise to any obligations, and if so, to determine the nature of such obligations.
Provisions under the Petrozuata AA

With respect to the Petrozuata AA, the Claimants rely on certain clauses of the
Preamble and two provisions i.e. Section 2.04(a) and 9.01(b).

Preambular Clauses: |n the Tribunal’s view, these clauses are merely descriptive of
the reasons why the Parties have entered into the Petrozuata AA and reflect their
general commitment to develop the Project. The Tribunal agrees with the
Respondents that the Claimants have provided insufficient explanation as to the
content of the obligations that these clauses purportedly generate. Merely stringing
together various tranches of the provisions and stating that the provisions “speak for
themselves” is not enough.®™ At best, as the Claimants themselves acknowledge, the
language of these Preambular clauses can inform the content of the obligations under
Section 2.04(a) and 9.01(b), if any.6°5 Accordingly the Preambular clauses of the
Petrozuata AA are of no assistance to the Claimants’ case insofar as they do not give
rise to any independent contractual obligations.

Section 2.04(a): The Claimants emphasize that this provision obligates the
Respondents to ‘act or to take all steps, as may be reasonably within its power and
use reasonable commercial efforts to cause the [Petrozuata C.A.] to act in
accordance with the provisions of the [Petrozuata AA].” The Tribunal is equally at a
loss as to the relevance of this provision. The Claimants cannot pick and choose
parts of the provision that suit their needs: the provision must be read as a whole.
Doing so reveals that this provision addresses how each Party — in their capacity as
shareholders and “co venturers” in Petrozuata C.A. — will vote to ensure that
Petrozuata C.A. acts in accordance with the Petrozuata AA. The Claimants’ witness,
Mr. van Wageningen admitted as much at the Hearing. He described the
abovementioned provision as “[His] Governance Provisions” through which he
wanted to make sure that [PDVSA Petroleo] would “behave as a partner within the

604 C-PHB, §§ 192-194.

378.

joint venture and not just simply a representative of the State oil company.®® The
Respondents have rightly pointed out that the dispute in this case does not concern
the manner in which Parties exercise their voting rights vis-a-vis Petrozuata C.A.
Moreover, nothing in the Claimants’ allegations suggests that the Respondents have
caused Petrozuata C.A. to act contrary to the Petrozuata AA, much less that they
would have used their voting rights in a contrary manner. In the circumstances, the
Tribunal remains unconvinced that this provision creates the broad obligations that
the Claimants attribute to it.

Section 9.01(b): The Claimants submit that pursuant to this provision, the
Respondents are required to “vote, act, take all steps reasonably necessary and use
all reasonable commercial efforts to carry out and assure the success of the Projects”
and to refrain from “tak[ing] any action not contemplated [in the Petrozuata AA] that
may adversely affect the performance by [Petrozuata C.A.] of its obligations under its
Charter or under any Business Contract.” These prescriptions are contained in the set
of provisions that address the manner in which the business and operations of
Petrozuata C.A. are to be undertaken.®” Within that context, the Tribunal considers
that these prescriptions do indeed obligate the Respondent to use all reasonable
commercial efforts to carry out and assure the success of the Project, and to refrain
from taking any actions that will adversely affect the performance of Petrozuata C.A.’s

obligations.

Arguably, this provision generates mirror obligations, first, that the Respondents shall
use “all reasonable commercial efforts” to ensure the success of the Project; and,
second, that the Respondents should not act in a manner that will impede or place
obstacles in the performance of the Project or prevent Petrozuata C.A. from carrying
out its operations.6°° The Respondents’ expert, Prof. Garcia Montoya, conceded at
the Hearing that a unilateral taking of the Projects by the Respondents (without

authority of law) would be sufficient to breach this provision:

Q. [...] [T]his is the Petrozuata Association Agreement, and | want to direct your
attention to 9.01(b). In this situation--in this situation would Respondents have
breached their obligation to “take all steps reasonably necessary and use all

607 Petrozuata AA, C-1, Section IX. For the sake of good order, the Tribunal notes that here and elsewhere
whenever reference is made to the Claimant/s and/or Respondent/s, it should be construed as reference to the
relevant Claimant and/or Respondent in the given circumstances.

reasonable commercial efforts to carry out and assure the success of the
Project’?

A. | think | would make reference to the other section that you've
highlighted at the end here, and it says, “None of the Parties will take any
action not contemplated herein that may adversely affect the performance
by the Company of its obligations under its Charter or any Business
Contract.”

And it is more important impeding the performance of the Contract, in and
of itself, so this would impair the operation of the company if this were
done unilaterally and not backed by a law that would support the actions
by Respondents.

Q. And would there be a breach of the duty of good faith in this situation?

A. Yes, assuming that the actions were carried out without a legal power

established for PdVSA, and that there was no decree-law or another act similar

to [the 2007 Nationalization Decree].6°?
The Tribunal notes the Respondents’ contention that Section 9.01(b) requires the
operations of Petrozuata C.A. to be conducted in accordance with all applicable laws,
and that this would militate against any allegation that the qualified measures should
not have been applied to Petrozuata C.A. However, the Claimants do not appear to
challenge the measures themselves or that Petrozuata C.A. had to comply with them.
Rather, they complain against the Respondents’ purportedly active role in procuring
the qualified measures.

Provisions under the Hamaca AA

With respect to the Hamaca AA, the Claimants rely on Articles 2.1(b), 10.4(a) and
10.5(a).

Article 2.1(b): According to the Claimants, Article 2.1(b) obligates the Respondents to
conduct the Project activities “so as to make the best economic utilization of Project
resources and assets to achieve the maximum benefit for the Project and the Parties
in their capacity as participants in the Association.” Article 2.1(b) is a part of the
provisions that deal with the “Object of the Association”. It states in relevant part
that “the intention and plan of the Parties [is] that all Project activities be conducted
in a safe manner preserving the environment in accordance with applicable law and

383.

so as to make the best economic utilization of Project resources and assets to
achieve the maximum benefit for the Project and the Parties in their capacity as
participants in the Association.”*"' At best (for the Claimants’ case), it can be said that
this provision contains a statement of the Parties’ intention or is descriptive of the
motivations that shall inform the Parties’ conduct. In the Tribunal’s view, the
Respondents are correct in asserting that the aforesaid statement “does not translate
into the sweeping obligation Claimants posit as the basis for their [Willful Breach
Claim]’.°"? Put differently, this provision does not generate any specific “best efforts”

obligations.

Articles _10.4(a) and _10.5(a): These provisions allegedly impose upon the
Respondents an obligation to use their “best efforts to maintain at all times [the]
application [...] of the most favorable royalty [and tax] regime permitted by law” to the
Parties in their capacity as participants in the AAs.°"S According to the Claimants the
maintenance of the most favorable royalty and tax regime was to be achieved
through “formal approaches to, and meetings with, Venezuelan governmental
authorities”.°4 On this basis, the Claimants have argued that the Respondents had
an obligation to “resist changes to the fiscal regime for the Projects” and to “lobby” the

Government against the qualified measures.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants’ reading of the provision is not commensurate
with its text. First, the Tribunal disagrees that the Respondents had an unqualified
obligation to ensure the application of the most favorable fiscal regime to the Projects.
As the Respondents rightly point out, the obligation to ensure that the “most
favourable” royalty or tax regime applies to the Parties is not in abstracto. It is
conditional upon “taking into account the existing legal regime and the economics of
the Project, as such factors may change from time to time”.®® Accordingly, the
Tribunal considers that any potential obligation would only arise in the event that the
qualified measures were not imposed by the prevailing legal regime and did not
suitably reflect the attendant economic realities of the Projects. The Claimants have
not contested or been able to explain that the qualified measures were contrary to the
conditions indicated above.*'® The Respondents, on the other hand, have submitted

that the qualified measures were indeed applied keeping in mind Project economics,
in particular the rise in oil prices since the investment was made.®’” In the
circumstances, the Tribunal finds it difficult to accept that the mere alteration of the
royalty and tax rates resulted in a non-favorable fiscal regime, which in turn gave rise
to a best efforts obligation.

Second, the Tribunal is unconvinced that the Respondents had an obligation to
“lobby” the Government, as proposed by the Claimants. Contrary to how the
Claimants phrase it, Articles 10.4(a) and 10.5(a) merely state that “[a]ll formal
approaches to, and meetings with, Venezuelan governmental authorities to establish
such items shall be directed by [Corpoguanipa]”.*'® The Tribunal reads this as a
statement of who has the obligation to set up meetings with the Government, in the
event both Parties decide to approach the Government. The language does not
generate a unilateral duty on the part of the Respondents to “lobby” the Government
against any and every fiscal measures that altered the previously applicable royalty
and tax regime. Therefore, at best, the Respondents’ obligation to “formally
approach” the Government would only materialize if a decision was made to

approach the Government.

The Tribunal also notes that, in the context of the Hamaca AA, the Claimants did not
inform the Respondents that they considered the qualified measures or the effects
thereof to also constitute a violation of the Respondents’ contractual obligations. Nor
for that matter did they ask the Respondents to formally approach the Government in
connection with the qualified measures. This has been confirmed by the testimony of
the Claimants’ own witness at the Hearing:*"9

PRESIDENT LEVY: [...] [D]id you ever personally make it known that you were

dissatisfied with the conduct of your partner or your two partners? I'm talking

about the Venezuelan partners. Did you ever tell them, “No, you're not
conducting the way | expect you to do”?

THE WITNESS: No, not personally.
PRESIDENT LEVY: Okay. Not personally.
THE WITNESS: Yes.

PRESIDENT LEVY: Are you aware that someone did?

THE WITNESS: I'm not aware that there were direct communications that
we were dissatisfied with the partner, but our partners were very much
aware of our dissatisfaction with all of the activities and measures that were
happening [...] With each measure. We it very made clear, our dissatisfaction.

[el

PRESIDENT LEVY: Very well. Incidentally, you were dissatisfied--again, I'm
not talking about the Government. I'm talking strictly about your partners
and, in fact, the Parties to this arbitration now. What was the subject of
dissatisfaction, your subject of dissatisfaction? You said they were very much
aware that you were dissatisfied. I'm not going to ask you to give all your
subjects of dissatisfaction, but what was--what did they know that you
were dissatisfied with? Measure by measure. 2004, you had the 1 percent
royalty tax which went up. Then you had the Extraction Tax. Then you had the--
| never remember, it's not Income Tax, it's not corporate tax--sorry?--Income
Tax. So, thank you. Income Tax, et cetera. So, you were always dissatisfied,
and | can understand why. But there was clarity with your partners why
you were dissatisfied with them? I'm not talking about the Measure. I'm not
talking about the Government. | ask you if your partners were aware that
you were dissatisfied with them, not with the Government.

THE WITNESS: Yeah. It--well, primarily, it's around the cash flow impact. [...]

PRESIDENT LEVY: [...] Of course, the cash flow would be affected [...] But do
you say that it's because of them that the cash flow would be affected, or
because of the Government measures?

THE WITNESS: Well, as we got further into the measures, it was--we didn't
really differentiate them versus the Government.

PRESIDENT LEVY: Why?

THE WITNESS: Because the--we expected they were involved with the
policies that were coming out in the public statements. The oversight of the
entity had changed. The new PdVSA was a different entity than the entity we
had negotiated our Agreements with, and they acted that way [...] So, there
was--we fully assumed that they were working in the process, and none of this
was going to be a surprise.62°
386. From the above testimony, the Tribunal understands that the Respondents may
indeed have been aware that the Claimants had objections to the qualified measures.
However, apart from this general awareness, it appears that the Claimants at no point
expressly indicated to the Respondents that they had acted in breach of their
contractual obligations, especially not with specific reference to what contractual
obligations were breached and by which company. As already noted above,®' the
Claimants’ objections pertained to the Government's obligations under international
law and the Respondents’ alleged breaches under the AAs find no mention therein.
Moreover, the Claimants evidently never approached the Respondents to undertake
their alleged contractual obligation to set up formal meetings with the Government.

620 Tr. (Day 3), 699:15-702:13 (Mr Heinrich).
821 Supra, §§ 214-216.

171

Given these circumstances, it is inapposite for the Claimants to contend that an
obligation to “lobby” the Government ever materialized, much less that it has been
breached.

387. Be that as it may, to the Tribunal’s mind, there is another considerable flaw in the
Claimants’ arguments regarding these provisions. In response to the Tribunal’s
questions as to why they did not inform the Respondents of their grievances, the

Claimants’ witness had the following to say:

PRESIDENT LEVY: [...] What practically could [the Respondents] have done to
support you after 2004? Practical terms. What could they have done?

THE WITNESS: They could have worked with us to help convince the Ministry
of the importance of a stable fiscal environment and the benefits that brings to
investment.

PRESIDENT LEVY: But do | understand correctly from what you told me
earlier that you never practically requested anyone--not you personally
this time, I'm talking about your team--you never requested any practical
measure? You never told them, why don't you go meet Mr. X at the
Ministry and discuss that point? Did you?

THE WITNESS: No.
PRESIDENT LEVY: No. Okay.

THE WITNESS: Because, again, the environment felt so different then that we
didn't expect any results would come.®22

388. When the Claimants themselves did not expect any results from “lobbying” the
Government, their entire allegation that this obligation has been breached rings very
hollow indeed.®°

622 Tr. (Day 3), 702:14-703:7 (Mr Heinrich).

23 For completeness, the Tribunal notes that the Respondents’ witness, Dr. Mommer, also testified that lobbying
would have been futile as the decision to impose these measures has been made. See Tr. (Day 6), 1550:3-
1552:18 (Dr. Mommer) (Q. Now, let's imagine a situation here. Let's imagine if, as Director of PdVSA, Mr.
Ramirez is approached by ConocoPhillips, and he and you and PdVSA is asked to lobby to protect this Project
from the nationalization. What do you think would have happened? A. Again, it is a hypothetical question,
ConocoPhillips would not have talked to President of PdV to talk about that. It would have talked to the Minister,
and they may have asked, well, if there is a definitive word, last word, well, it came from President Chavez. Hard
to argue it was not a definitive word. Q. So, what is the reaction you think ConocoPhillips would have got if they
had asked PdVSA, led by Mr. Ramirez, to lobby on its behalf at this time? A. It seems to me absurd to even
hypothetically suggest that they would talk to the President of PdV regarding forced migration. They had
to talk to the Government. It was a Measure announced by the Government, by the highest level of
Government. So, you had to talk to the highest level of Government and to see what you can do about it.
PRESIDENT LEVY: It's also hypothetical, but imagine for a second that it would have been important for Conoco
to discuss that with PdVSA; that is, the possibility of lobbying. Who would have been available at PdVSA to
discuss that? You tell me Mr. Ramirez would have been the Minister, so it's absurd to think that you can approach
him as PdVSA representative. Who would have been available for Conoco to discuss with at PdVSA? THE
WITNESS: Its Parties, the Association. It was the Association that would migrate, so it would affect CVP--the
Subsidiary of PdV. They're partners in the joint venture. That was the logical contact. PRESIDENT LEVY: So, it
would have had to discuss with CVP. THE WITNESS: Yes, with Eulogio Del Pino, if you want, who was the head
of CVP. That was it. They had Parties. PdV was part of the Association that forced to migrate. PdV was forced to

172

389. Finally, regarding the relevance of the duty of good faith, both Parties appear to agree
that the duty of good faith under Article 1160 of the VCC does not generate new
contractual obligations, but only determines the contours of existing contractual
obligations.®*4 Thus, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants’ invocation of the
duty of good faith would be relevant to the extent that the Respondents have
performed their contractual obligations in bad faith, or that their actions suggest an
improper use of their contractual prerogative — to use the Claimants’ words “as a
gauge of Respondents’ performance of their express contractual obligations”.6%

390. As the Tribunal has concluded that only Section 9.01(b) of the Petrozuata AA gives
rise to a “reasonable commercial efforts” obligation, the duty of good faith may inform

the scope of this provision only.

391. Finally, the Tribunal must also assess the nature of the obligations flowing from
Section 9.01(b) and the implications thereof, in view of the Respondents’ argument

that this provision only generates an “obligation of means”.

392. The Respondents have invoked the writings of various authors to explain the scope of
in “obligation of means” as understood under Venezuelan law. According to their
writings — with which the Claimants agree in principle — in case of an obligation of
means, “given the randomness of the desired result, the debtor promises only his
diligence, a vigorous, attentive conduct to anticipate possible obstacles and to try to
overcome them, but there the only thing that the debtor can really promise is this

prudent and careful behaviour.”626

393. The Respondents have also referred to French legal authorities on this issue, to show
the similarity in understanding of this concept in the two jurisdictions. As the concept

 

migrate, not only Conoco, not only ARCO, not only Chevron. PRESIDENT LEVY: And do you know who the head
of CVP was at the time? THE WITNESS: Yes. Eulogio Del Pino. PRESIDENT LEVY: Mr. Del Pino. And if Mr. Del
Pino had requested a meeting with the Ministry, whether you, Mr. Ramirez, whoever would be in charge, what
would have happened? You said it's absurd, so | would like to make sure that | understand exactly your position.
THE WITNESS: For sure, they would not talk to me. At that level and given this situation, they would have to talk
to the Minister at the very least. [...] The Minister upwards. Not to me. | was out of this decision, and so they
would have to talk to the Minister and to make the argument, but the decision was taken. PRESIDENT LEVY:
Yes. And putting two--exactly. And putting two and two together, even talking with the Ministry would not have
had much logic, given what you said earlier. You don't even know what Minister Ramirez had as a
personal view on the nationalization or forced migration or whatever. THE WITNESS: He had personal
views, but he had also no doubt that he would go with the decision of the Government. That was his role
as a Minister. (emphasis added)).

is indeed similarly understood, the Tribunal considers it sufficient to note the position
under French law without opining on whether or not recourse can be had thereto:

[t]he obligation is of means when the debtor has committed to doing what is
possible to achieve a result contemplated by the parties, but of which the debtor
cannot or does not want to guarantee the achievement. The obligation requires
him to adopt a reasonable and diligent behaviour, the non-performance will
then be characterized by a mistake in conduct, namely by a deviation from
what the creditor was entitled to expect from a reasonable and diligent
debtor placed in the same circumstances.®””

 

As to the implications of an obligation being one of “means”, the Respondents
contend that “merely showing that the goal was not obtained does not prove the
existence of non-performance”.®*8 The debtor of an obligation of means will only be
considered responsible for breach if the creditor can show that “the activity or the
conduct performed by the debtor is less than what is due; [that] it is defective. In other
words [the creditor] must show the fault of the debtor”.®9

The Claimants do not dispute the classification of the aforementioned contractual
provision as an obligation of means. Nor do they contest that the burden is upon them
to prove that the Respondents’ actions violate the expectation of diligent conduct.®°
In the circumstances, it is for the Claimants to show whether the Respondents’
actions and omissions (that have been elaborated at paragraphs 342 — 354 above)
constitute a failure to exercise the requisite level of due diligence in discharging their
obligations under this provision of the Petrozuata AA.

3.2. Do the Respondents’ actions breach the “reasonable commercial
efforts” obligation (element (ii) of the civil liability test)?

Having concluded that the Respondents are contractually obligated to exercise
reasonable commercial efforts pursuant to Section 9.01(b) of the Petrozuata AA, the
next question for the Tribunal to determine is whether the specific actions and
omissions complained of at paragraphs 342 — 354 above, constitute breaches of such
obligation.

By and large the conduct complained of relates to the purported transformation of the
“old PDVSA” into the “new PDVSA” and the alleged role played by key PDVSA
Officials by virtue of their dual positions in the Government and PDVSA. According to
the Claimants these “dual hats” enabled PDVSA to be transformed into a mouthpiece
of the Chavez Administration and implement its policies in complete disregard of their

obligations as contractual partners.

To begin with, it is difficult to comprehend the underlying rationale of the Claimants’
“old PDVSA’ vs. ‘new PDVSA” argument. Even assuming that the “old PDVSA” was
purportedly independent from the Government, it was not a State within a State, left
entirely to its own devices. Quite to the contrary, PDVSA was and at all times
remained indisputably a State entity required to act in accordance with its governing
documents. It is also indisputable that pursuant to the provisions of its Articles of
Association and By-laws, PDVSA is required to implement the policies as determined
by the Government." Some of the relevant provisions are set out below:

Article 1 — There shall be created a state company, under the form of a
Sociedad Anonima, which shall comply with and implement policy in
matters of hy bons that the i i i through
the Ministry of Energy and Mines in the activities that are entrusted to it.®°?

 

 

 

[Ll
Title 1
General Provisions
Clause 2: The carrying out of the corporate purpose shall be done by the
company under the guidelines and policies that the National Executive,

through the Ministry of Energy and Mines, establishes or decides in
accordance with the powers conferred upon it by law.

 

The activities that the State company carries out to that end shall be subject
to the norms of control that said Ministry establishes in the exercise of the
competence conferred to it by Article 7 of the Organic Law that Reserves to the
State the Industry and Trade of Hydrocarbons.*3 (emphasis added)
In these circumstances, regardless of whether it was “old” or “new”, PDVSA was
bound to comply with and implement the policies of the prevailing Government and it

was not at liberty to pursue its own agenda in that regard. As discussed in more detail

631 See Allan R. Brewer-Carias, The Nature of Petrdleos de Venezuela, S.A., as an Instrument of the State in the
Oil Industry, 23 Revista de Derecho Publico, July-September 1985, Garcia Montoya ER |, RER-1 App. GM-54, pp

State are not extraneous to the Respondent. See infra, §§ 462, 473 - 474.

below®* the Claimants would have difficulty contradicting this trite fact and
acknowledge it in the process of trying to establish that PDVSA and the Government
were organically linked. It is therefore contradictory for the Claimants to allege, on the
one hand, that PDVSA’s organic link to the Government is demonstrated by their
obligation to comply with Government guidelines and policies, and, on the other hand,
contend that this allegedly “organically linked” PDVSA should have acted contrary to
these very policies in discharging its contractual obligations. It is not sufficient in this
regard to advance that PDVSA itself prompted or prepared such guidelines and
policies and this reinforces the point. Thus, in the Tribunal’s view, the distinction
between the “old” and the “new” PDVSA does not advance the Claimants’ case in any

manner.

The next set of allegations pertain to the consequences that flow from the alleged
“dual hat[s]” worn by two PDVSA officials, namely, Mr. Ramirez, (who was
simultaneously the Minister of Energy and the President of PDVSA) and Dr. Mommer
(who was simultaneously the Vice Minister of Hydrocarbons and a non-executive
Director on the Board of PDVSA). The Tribunal notes that although allegations have
been made against four officials (i.e. including Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Del Pino), the
Claimants have concentrated largely on Mr. Ramirez and Dr. Mommer to support
their “dual hat” theory. Hence, the Tribunal’s analysis will concentrate on the
allegations about these two individuals.

The core of the Claimants’ allegations appear to be that (i) Mr. Ramirez and Dr.
Mommer were responsible for formulating the various qualified measures®> as well
as conceptualizing the Expropriation; (ii) it is impossible that these individuals would
have been able to maintain a difference in their own minds as to what capacity they
were acting in at the relevant point of time; and therefore (iii) it should be presumed
that all actions performed by these individuals in their capacity as Ministers are
equally the actions of PDVSA and vice-versa.

Keeping in mind the burden and standard of proof that the Claimants have to
discharge, the Claimants must be able to show that while undertaking the allegedly
breaching conduct, these individuals represented themselves as PDVSA. They have
to show that the course of events leading up to the Expropriation would not have
occurred without the contributions of these officials acting as PDVSA. Alternatively,

Extraction Tax on the Projects; and the Income Tax Increase in 2006.

176

the Claimants need to show that when Mr. Ramirez and Dr. Mommer were
discharging their functions as PDVSA President and Director respectively, they were
actually acting as the “State”, that they were disregarding PDVSA’s interests
altogether, and that their conduct surpassed their obligation to act in accordance with
State policy pursuant to the PDVSA By-laws.

403. The single element on which the Claimants’ entire argument appears to be
constructed is the allegation that it is impossible to distinguish who these individuals
were acting for at a given point of time; that merely the wearing of “dual hats”
constituted a breach as everything they did on behalf of the Ministry would equally be
an act of PDVSA. The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument.

404. With respect to Mr. Ramirez, the fact that he was simultaneously PDVSA President
and the Minister of Energy does not automatically imply that all actions taken in his
capacity as the Minister were equally those of PDVSA, even if they did relate to the
oil industry or even to PDVSA itself. The Tribunal notes that the Claimants have relied
upon the fact that Mr. Ramirez was involved in the formulation of the oil policy for the
Chavez Administration, i.e. the policy of “Full Oil Sovereignty”. But that was indeed
part of his functions as the Minister. Also, regardless of any actual inputs that he may
have made in his capacity as PDVSA President, it is ultimately for the Government to
formulate and enact the laws that reflect this purported policy of “Full Oil
Sovereignty”.® The Tribunal notes that the Claimants cite numerous public speeches
and interviews given by Mr. Ramirez denouncing the Apertura Petrolera and the AAs
and rely on the same as indicative of Mr. Ramirez active role in bringing about the
destruction of the AAs.®°” However, apart from the fact that Mr. Ramirez held dual
positions while giving these speeches, there is nothing in the record to sufficiently
indicate that in each of these instances Mr Ramirez was not only expressing his
views as the Minister but also acting in his capacity as PDVSA President. Absent
such additional substantiation, the Tribunal cannot accept the Claimants’ contention
that Mr. Ramirez was equally representing PDVSA.

405. Similarly, although the Claimants have challenged the actions of Dr. Mommer, the
record shows that at all times he was acting in his capacity as the Vice Minister of
Hydrocarbons and that he never interacted with the Claimants as a representative of
PDVSA.®8 This is also the case with Mr. Ramirez. Moreover, the record also shows
that the Claimants understood this fact, because all communications to Mr. Ramirez
and Dr. Mommer have been addressed to them in their governmental capacity.69 As
the Respondents have repeated time and again:

[throughout the so-called dismantling of the Apertura Petrolera, which
Claimants argue commenced with the 2004 Royalty Measure, up to the filing of
the Requests for Arbitration in this case in 2014, i.e., for an entire decade,
ConocoPhillips recognized that the actions that caused Claimants’ losses were
all actions of the Government, not these Respondents.®4°

406. Some of the correspondence between the Claimants and Mr. Ramirez or Dr.
Mommer as the case may be, is set out below:

i. On 22 November 2004, the Claimants addressed a letter to Mr. Ramirez in

his capacity as the Minister of Energy, objecting to the Royalty Measure;®41

ii. On 14 January 2005, the Claimants addressed a letter to Mr. Ramirez in his
capacity as the Minister of Energy and agreed to pay the Royalty

Measure;&2

On 26 April 2005, Dr. Mommer in his capacity as the Vice Minister of
Hydrocarbons addressed a letter to the Claimants regarding the potential
problems with the Petrozuata AA and Project;64?

iv. On 18 October 2006, the Claimants addressed a letter to Dr. Mommer in his
capacity as the Vice Minister of Hydrocarbons in respect of the
restructuring of the Hamaca Project;544

On 29 November 2006, the Claimants addressed a letter to Dr. Mommer in
his capacity as the Vice Minister of Hydrocarbons objecting to the
imposition of the qualified measures by the Government;®5

On 31 January 2007, the Claimants addressed a letter to Mr. Ramirez (in his
capacity of Minister of Energy), President Maduro (in his then capacity of
Minister of Foreign Affairs), and Ms. Gladis Gutiérrez (in her capacity of
Attorney General) and copying Dr. Mommer (in his capacity of Vice
Minister of Hydrocarbons), stating that Venezuela’s actions were contrary to
the Venezuela-Netherlands BIT as well as the Foreign Investment Law, and
therefore providing notice of the existence of a dispute under these

instruments;&46

. On 12 April 2007 the Claimants addressed a letter to both Mr. Ramirez (in his

capacity of Minister of Energy) and Dr. Mommer (in his capacity of Vice
Minister of Hydrocarbons) in connection with the migration of the Projects
into mixed enterprises.”

viii. Numerous emails were addressed by Dr. Mommer to the Claimants, all in his

capacity as the Vice Minister of Hydrocarbons.®48

In any event, at the time Dr. Mommer presumably conceptualized the qualified public
measures, he was a Managing Director of an entirely different PDVSA subsidiary®?
which was not even a party to the AAs. Insofar as his role as a member of the Board
of Directors of PDVSA is concerned, this in and of itself generates no consequences
especially in light of the fact that Dr. Mommer was an external director of PDVSA and
had no executive functions or authority to represent PDVSA before third parties.°°
Therefore, the Claimants’ attempt to bring him within the purview of the reasonable
commercial efforts obligation under the Petrozuata AA is far-fetched and does not
withstand scrutiny.

Additionally, the Tribunal accords weight to the Respondents’ contention that the
appointments of Mr. Ramirez and Dr. Mommer to PDVSA were entirely incidental to
their role in the Ministry. According to this argument, the Tribunal merely needs to ask
itself whether anything that transpired from 2003 (the “transformation of the PDVSA”)
to the Expropriation in 2007 would have changed if PDVSA itself had remained
neutral and independent from the Chavez Administration.®5' For the Tribunal, the
answer is evidently “no”. Even if the Respondents had remained purportedly neutral
and independent of the Government and even if Mr. Ramirez and Dr. Mommer had
only held positions in the Ministry, they could have nonetheless devised and executed
the Government's plan to nationalize the Projects. Their simultaneous role as PDVSA
officials did not give them any special powers to assist the Government and
participate in the Overall Expropriation. The same would have been put into motion in
2007 in any event. Similarly, regardless of its neutrality and independence, PDVSA,
being required by its constitutive documents to adhere to the Government's policies
and the law, would have no other recourse but to comply with each of the qualified
measures. When viewed in this manner, the Claimants’ allegations regarding the
alleged implications of the “dual hats” worn by these officials are quite a leap in logic.

The Tribunal also finds it rather curious that despite their vehement objections to Mr.
Ramirez and Dr. Mommer’s “dual hatting” today, the Claimants do not appear to have
contemporaneously challenged such appointments or the actions of the Government
that made them possible. The Tribunal recollects that initially, the Articles of
Association of PDVSA did not permit the Minister of Energy to simultaneously hold
the post of PDVSA President.®? This was presumably done to ensure a separation
between PDVSA and the Government. However, in order to allow Mr. Ramirez to
simultaneously act as PDVSA President, in 2004, the Government (and specifically
President Chavez) amended the By-laws of PDVSA through a legislative act such
that the Minister of Energy and Mines became eligible to be appointed as PDVSA
President from that time onwards.®? On the same day, by another legislative act, the
Government also proceeded to appoint Mr. Ramirez as PDVSA's President.
Arguably, if the Claimants perceived these actions as “dual hatting” and contrary to
their interests, they could have objected to the same and/or challenged the laws at

the relevant time. There is nothing on record to show that the Claimants in fact did so.
Thus, having accepted this state of affairs, it is unconvincing for the Claimants to now
cry foul. By the same token, it is also arguable that the “dual hatting” was engendered
and maintained by the Government, for it was the Government's legislative acts that
bestowed a dual hat on Mr. Ramirez and Dr. Mommer. It has not been argued that
PDVSA was responsible for electing Mr. Ramirez as the President. Thus, given the
Government's role, it is questionable to what extent PDVSA can be held “responsible”
for breaching contractual obligations in the instant case.

In any event, to the extent that the “dual hats” worn by these two officials may
implicate the Tribunal’s assessment of the alleged breach of the reasonable
commercial efforts obligation, the Tribunal considers that the Respondents would
nevertheless be exonerated of liability due to the absence of a legally sufficient
causal link between their alleged breaches and the loss caused to the Claimants.®°

The Claimants have further alleged that PDVSA, and Mr. Ramirez personally,
procured the 2007 Nationalization Decree pursuant to which they confiscated the
Projects. According to the Claimants, the Respondents’ “common enterprise” with the
Government in getting the 2007 Nationalization Decree enacted is evidenced by (i)
the speeches of key PDVSA officials denouncing the AAs and the Apertura Petrolera;
(ii) Mr. Ramirez’s role in drafting the 2007 Nationalization Decree, as he was the
concerned Minister in the Government; and (iii) the Respondents’ role and
contribution in developing the Plan Siembra Petrolera or the “Full Oil Sovereignty”
Plan. In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants’ position once again suffers from the same
wrong assumption that everything done by one entity, i.e. the Government, is equally
attributable to PDVSA. Pertinently, the Tribunal observes that this appears to be an
assumption that the Claimants have made very early on.

As elaborated above, at the Hearing, Claimants’ witness Mr Heinrich stated that
“[they] didn't really differentiate [PDVSA] versus the Government [and...] expected
[that PDVSA] were involved with the policies that were coming out in the public
statements. [...] [The Claimants] fully assumed that [PDVSA] were working in the
process, and none of [the qualified measures] was going to be a surprise.” It
appears to the Tribunal that while the Claimants have built most of their case around
this assumption, they have failed to show that the numerous speeches they rely on

658 Infra, §§ 455-490.
656 Supra, § 385 (emphasis added).

181

415.

were in fact given by the Respondents, and not by Government officials or even both
at the same time.

The same can be said of Mr Ramirez's role in procuring the 2007 Nationalization
Decree. The Parties agree that the power to enact laws derives from the Venezuelan
Constitution.” Article 236 thereof delineates the powers and obligations of the
President of Venezuela which includes “the power to enact, with the previous
authorization of an enabling law, decrees with the force of law”.®5* This power is to be
exercised by the President “in the Council of Ministers” and the “acts of the President
of [Venezuela] [...] shall be countersigned to be valid by the [...] respective Minister
or Ministers.”65°

In light of this provision, the Respondents have argued that the entire policy of
nationalization and the steps that were taken to dismantle the Apertura, were
President Chavez's “brainchild” and are thus attributable to him alone. The
Respondents seem to suggest that Mr. Ramirez, despite being the Minister of Energy
and Petroleum, had nothing to do with formulating hydrocarbon policy or drafting the
2007 Nationalization Decree. The Claimants, of course, argue at the other extreme
that Mr. Ramirez's contribution to the policy of nationalization was made in his
capacity as PDVSA President. The truth, in the Tribunal’s view, lies somewhere in
between the Parties’ diametrically opposed positions.

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants to the extent that as a matter of Venezuelan
law, the concerned Minister would ordinarily be responsible for preparing drafts of
legislations and proposing them before the President and the Council of Ministers.
However, in this instance, it is also true that the Claimants have not proved, either
through documentary or other evidence, that Mr. Ramirez in fact drafted the 2007
Nationalization Decree and secured its enactment.®*' As the Respondents point out,
the Claimants’ entire argument appears to be based once again on the presumption
that this would have been the normal course of events under Venezuelan law. There
is some force in the Respondents’ argument that the Claimants have not produced

any witnesses who would have had personal knowledge of Mr. Ramirez’s
involvement in drafting the 2007 Nationalization Decree or any documents that attest
to the same. Consequently, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Claimants’
conclusion that Mr. Ramirez was acting pursuant to his powers as PDVSA President

at the relevant time.

As regards the Plan Siembra Petrolera, the Claimants’ allegations appear to hinge on
a “timeline” or presentation that is available on the PDVSA’s website®*4 and on
President Chavez's declaration that “[t]his Plan came out of PDVSA, [...] was
developed in PDVSA”.®° According to the Tribunal, aside from possibly being political
posturing, the latter does not prove anything. In particular, it certainly does not prove
that the Plan Siembra Petrolera was conceived by PDVSA to destroy the AA and
retain all the profits. As for the presentation on the PDVSA website, it merely records
events across a timeline. The Tribunal cannot agree that this presentation is
representative of a detailed plan of action to destroy the AAs and take control over
the Orinoco Oil Belt, much less that it would have been formulated by Mr. Ramirez or
Dr. Mommer acting as PDVSA.

Conclusion

In sum, the Tribunal concludes that (i) only Section 9.01(b) of the Petrozuata AA
gives rise to a “reasonable commercial efforts” obligation; (ii) none of the provisions of
the Hamaca AA invoked by the Claimants give rise to a “best efforts” obligation; (iii)
the obligation under the Petrozuata AA is an obligation of means and it is therefore
the Claimants’ burden to prove that the said obligation has been breached; and (iv)
the Claimants have failed to discharge this burden and to prove that the
Respondents’ actions constitute a breach of Section 9.01(b) of the Petrozuata AA.

d. Second Willful Breach Claim: the existence and breach, if any, of the
Respondents’ duty to perform the AAs (i.e., elements (i) and (ii) of the civil
liability test)

418. The Claimants contend that the Respondents’ failure to perform their contractual
obligations under the AAs and the Guarantees “during the course of 2007" is a
clear breach of their fundamental duty of performance pursuant to Articles 1264 and
1271 of the VCC. At the outset, the Tribunal deems it important to note that, whilst the
Claimants have placed great emphasis on this argument — and it would now appear
to be perhaps even the key prong of the two Willful Breach Claims — it was articulated
for the first time in the Claimants’ PHB on the basis of their experts’ testimony at the
Hearing.%°”

419. At the Hearing, in response to the Tribunal’s questions, the Claimants’ experts
clarified that under Venezuelan law, the non-performance of a contract in and of itself
is a prima facie breach of such contract:

ARBITRATOR AYNES: [...] The starting point, of course, is because we have
to decide on a claim for liability in contract, of course, the starting point is to find
a breach, and Mr. Kahale repeatedly pointed out rightly that the first point is to
have a breach. Is it right that, under your law, a breach of a contract—the
nonperformance of a contract, in itself, is prima facie a breach of the
contract?

THE WITNESS [Prof. Brewer-Carias]: Yes, it is like that.

ARBITRATOR AYNES: So, here it seemed that it is not disputable that, at a
certain point in time PdVSA ceased to perform the Association
Agreement; is that right?

THE WITNESS: Yes.

ARBITRATOR AYNES: So, can we take it as a legal consequence that that
is prima facie a breach of the Contract? Is that right, under your law?

THE WITNESS: Correct.

ARBITRATOR AYNES: Or do we have to find other type of breach, specific
violation of a specific clause, or something like that, or can we take it as a
starting point that the nonperformance of the Contract is the breach.

THE WITNESS: Is a breach. That's correct.°©°

ARBITRATOR AYNES: So, you--normally, you have not to find a specific
provision which is breached in cases where the Contract has been given up,
you know? When, at a certain point in time, the Contract is no more performed.

THE WITNESS: Yes, | agree.
[Ll

THE WITNESS: If you have a contract, and you do everything not to
accomplish with the contract, you don't have to identify one word or
phrase in the text of the contract. It's the will not to comply with the
obligation of the contract. That's the basic breach.°”°

420. Prof. Mata Borjas corroborated Prof Brewer-Carias’ testimony:

ARBITRATOR AYNES: [...] [I]s there any difference between a breach in the
course of performing of a contract, that means you are badly performing, or you
are--and then you have to appreciate whether it is serious, not serious and so
on, and a breach which consists in nonperforming at all a contract at a
certain point in time?

THE WITNESS: I'm not sure | understand, but, in any case, the
nonperformance--you might not perform a trivial or a minor obligation under
Venezuelan law, according to Professor Mélich. That should not trigger the
consequence, which is the option for the innocent Party to request
performance, to request the termination of the agreement, and in any case to
request compensation for damages.

ARBITRATOR AYNES: Yes, but if it is nonperformance of the contract as a
whole?

THE WITNESS: Well, then, you have a very serious breach, and there is no
doubt that damages would be the consequence unless a “causa extrafia
no imputable”, non-imputable element, interrupts the chain of
causation.°”!

421. The Claimants also refer to the testimony of the Respondents’ expert, Prof. Garcia
Montoya, who conceded during the Hearing that the Respondents’ takeover of the
Projects “would have impeded the performance of the Agreements [and] the
continuity of the Project... [which] in and of itself, constitutes a breach [and]
entails a violation of the obligation not to place obstacles and not to frustrate the
expectations of the other Party.”6”

422. The Respondents have addressed the Claimants’ allegations regarding breaches of
the contractual provisions in great detail. However, they have not commented, either
during the Hearing or in their PHB, on whether or not their non-performance of the
AAs and the Guarantees constitutes a breach under Article 1271 VCC. In particular,

the Respondents’ legal experts were not taken to that issue during their examination.
Instead, the Respondents proceed straight to arguing that their liability is precluded
due to the fact that, first, they were acting in compliance with the law (i.e. the 2007
Nationalization Decree) and, second, the Claimants have failed to establish the
causal link between their non-performance and the loss suffered. Going into the
elements of contractual liability, “compliance with the law” and “causation” are
“downstream” elements, namely, flowing from the Respondents to the Claimants; as
compared to the elements of existence of an obligation and its breach, which flow
“upstream” from the Claimants to the Respondents.

In any event, as with its discussion regarding the breach of the “reasonable
commercial efforts” obligation, the Tribunal considers it prudent to conduct the
present analysis by examining whether the first two elements of civil liability, namely,
(i) the existence of an obligation; and (ii) breach of that obligation, have been
satisfied.

i. Are the Respondents obligated to perform the AAs and the Guarantees?

As regards the existence of an obligation to perform the AAs and the Guarantees, in
light of the testimony of the Parties’ legal expert witnesses set out above, both Parties
appear to agree that such an obligation indeed exists. They also appear to agree that
pursuant to Article 1271 of the VCC, the total non-performance of a contract is a
prima facie breach which raises a presumption of liability.°7

The Tribunal is convinced and notes that such a conclusion is also consistent with the
nature of the obligation to perform a contract. To recapitulate, the Respondents have
characterized the obligation of “best efforts” invoked by the Claimants as obligations
of means and on this basis argued that it was the Claimants burden to prove
breach.°”4

However, this would not be the case with the obligation to perform the contract. As
conceded by the Respondents’ expert Prof. Garcia Montoya at the Hearing, with

873 Supra, §§ 419-421; Tr. (Day 8), 2114:23 — 2115:12 (Prof. Garcia Montoya).

874 As a matter of legal principle, there appears to be no controversy between the Parties as to the difference
between an obligation of means and an obligation of result (For the Respondents’ position see §§ 363-364 supra.
For the Claimants position, see C-PHB, §§ 339-341). As set out in the various authorities cited by the
Respondents, an obligation of result is one where the debtor promises to achieve a specific result, such that the
achievement of such a result is itself part of the obligation. In contrast, the debtor does not guarantee a result
when he undertakes an obligation of means. See, supra, fn. 587.

186

427.

428.

respect to an obligation of result, ‘performance is an end in itself’,8’5 and non-
performance of an obligation of result raises a presumption of liability:

Q. [...] Suppose that, in January 2007, the Respondents led by Mr. Ramirez as
President of PdVSA, unilaterally took over operations of the Projects. [...] They
have security prevent Claimants from entering the site. They stopped payment
to Claimants. Would that be a breach of the Association Agreements?

 

A. If the taking was unilateral, if there was no motivation or justification
under the Decree-Law, this would be a deviation of power, and this would
bring about liability, and Respondents would be acting against the principle of
legality, and this would bring about personal liability.

 

Q. What provision or provisions of the Association Agreements would
Respondents have breached in this situation?

A. In this case, they would have impeded the performance of the
Agreements, and they would have acted against the duties of respect to
freedom, and this is something that the authority needs to respect and public
entities also need to respect. They would have impeded the performance of the
Project.

Q. Are you referring to a specific provision when you referred to duties with
respect to freedom? Are there particular express provisions of the Association
Agreements to which you are pointing?

A. Well, in this case they would have impeded the continuity of the

Project. This, in and of itself, constitutes a breach. They are preventing

the Project from being performed, and this entails a violation of the

obligation not to place obstacles and not to frustrate the expectations of

the other Party, and this would be proceeding against good faith.”
Arguably, performing the AAs is indeed an end in itself. When parties enter into a
contract, the least that is expected in terms of the result sought to be achieved, is that
the contract will be performed per se; and failure to perform or obstructing
performance would hinder the achievement of this result. The Tribunal therefore
considers that performance of the AAs, more exactly of some of the obligations under
the AAs, and the Guarantees is an obligation of result. Accordingly, the
consequences of non-performance of such an obligation of result will have to be
considered in light of Article 1271 of the VCC, as conceded by the Respondents.®””

Having concluded that the Respondents were indeed obligated to perform the AAs
and that failure to do so would constitute a prima facie breach, the Tribunal shall now
proceed to assess whether or not the Respondents acted in breach of their obligation.

ji. Did the Respondents breach their obligation to perform the AAs and the

 

Guarantees?

Even though the Respondents have not engaged with the Claimants’ argument,
raised for the first time during the Hearing, regarding the existence and breach of a
general obligation to perform the AAs and the Guarantees, the burden still lies on the
Claimants to prove that the Respondents have committed a breach of their obligation
to perform these contracts.

The Tribunal finds that the Claimants’ case pertaining to the Second Willful Breach
Claim is rather nebulous inasmuch as the Claimants merely allege that the
Respondents failed to perform the AAs “during the course of 2007”.°”8 The Claimants
have not clearly set out (i) when this purported “non-performance” began or (ii) what
actions constituted such non-performance.

Thus, with a view to bringing some clarity to the Claimants’ case and also in order to
account for the Respondents’ counterarguments, to the extent that any such
arguments have been made, the Tribunal considers it prudent to examine the Second
Willful Breach Claim in the context of three distinct time periods:

1) Prior to February 2007, this being the period prior to the enactment of the
2007 Nationalization Decree;

2) February to 30 April 2007, this being the period from the enactment of the
2007 Nationalization Decree until the day prior to the Expropriation; and

3) 1 May 2007 onwards, this being the period from the date of the Expropriation
and afterwards.

The Tribunal deems these particular time periods to be relevant with a view to
effectively analyzing both Parties’ submissions. In this respect, while the Claimants
argue that the “non-performance” took place “during the course of 2007”, the
Respondents’ counterargument is that their actions were in compliance with the law.
Put differently, the Respondents contend that they were complying with the mandate
of the 2007 Nationalization Decree and thus their liability is precluded. With due
regard to these submissions, the Tribunal notes that the 2007 Nationalization Decree
was enacted in February 2007. Thus, from this period onwards, the Tribunal will have

678 C-PHB, §§ 329, 23(|), 27; The Tribunal notes that there appears to be only one occasion where the Claimants
suggest that the Respondents’ failure to perform the AAs and the Guarantees commenced from the date of the
Expropriation i.e. 1 May 2007. See C-PHB, § 179 (“From [1 May 2007] onwards, the Respondent's completely
failed to perform their obligations under the AAs and Guarantees’).

188

to assess the Claimants’ allegations having regard to the implications, if any, of the
Respondents’ defenses. In the period prior thereto, it follows that the Respondents’
defenses resting on the 2007 Nationalization Decree will not apply. With these
considerations in mind, the Tribunal will now assess whether the Respondents are in
breach of their obligation of performance in the context of the aforesaid three periods.

With respect to the first period, i.e. prior to February 2007, the Tribunal finds that the
Claimants have not articulated in any of their pleadings what actions they consider
constitute non-performance by the Respondents. Therefore, given the insufficiency of
the Claimants’ allegations and in the absence of any proof to the contrary, the
Tribunal considers that non-performance of the AAs by the Respondents during this
period cannot be said to have occurred.

With respect to the second period, i.e. February to 30 April 2007, the Tribunal is, once
again, not convinced that any non-performance of the AAs occurred during this
period. The Tribunal reiterates that in none of their pleadings have the Claimants
made allegations regarding which particular actions by the Respondents constituted
“non-performance” during this period. To borrow the words of the Respondents’
expert witness, Prof. Garcia Montoya, the Claimants have not shown that the
Respondents “unilaterally took over operations of the Projects. [...] They ha[d]
security prevent Claimants from entering the site [or that] [t]hey stopped payment to
Claimants”®”? or that they “impeded the continuity of the Projects” or “prevented the
Projects from being performed” in any way. The Tribunal further notes that significant
contemporaneous correspondence was addressed by the Claimants to the
Respondents during this period.®° However, in none of these letters did the
Claimants make a single allegation that the Respondents had ceased to perform or
were preventing the Claimants’ performance of the AAs.

Rather, it appears that the only actions which according to the Claimants, constituted
breaching conduct during this period, is the Respondents’ participation in the

migration negotiations pursuant to the 2007 Nationalization Decree. The Tribunal
recalls that the 2007 Nationalization Decree:

provided for the transformation of all oil associations, including the [Projects],

into mixed companies [...]. Article 3 [...] required the associations to transfer

operational control of the projects to PDVSA by April 30, 2007. Article 4 granted

the parties to the associations a period of four months from the date of

publication of [the 2007 Nationalization Decree] to reach agreement on the

other terms and conditions of the migration, [...]. In case no agreement was

reached within the initial four-month period, Article 5 required PDVSA

subsidiaries to assume the activities carried out by the associations to ensure

the continuity of the operations.®*1
In the instant case, it appears that upon the enactment of the 2007 Nationalization
Decree, the Claimants and the Respondents entered into negotiations with the
Government for the migration of the Project companies, i.e. Petrozuata C.A. and
Hamaca JVC, into empresas mixtas (mixed enterprises). However, since no
agreement was reached with the Claimants on the migration within the four-month
period provided for under the Decree, PDVSA’s subsidiaries took over the Projects on
1 May 2007. The Claimants contend that the Respondents allegedly threatened and
forced them to accept the migration on terms which were entirely biased in the
Respondents’ favor and under threat of expropriation. However - and this, in the
Tribunal’s view, is crucial - the Claimants submit that these very same threats
constitute a breach of the “reasonable commercial efforts” obligation by the

Respondents.

Given the tenor of the Claimants’ submissions, the Tribunal is of the view that either
one of two conclusions follows. First, that there is no factual allegation of “non-
performance” of the AAs and the Guarantees between February — 30 April 2007. As a
consequence, the Claimants have once again failed to prove breach of the AAs
through such non-performance. Second, and in the alternative, that the breach of the
“reasonable commercial efforts” obligation between February — 30 April 2007 due to
the Respondents’ participation in the migration negotiation also constitutes “non-
performance” of the “reasonable commercial efforts” obligation. However, this would
be fallacious. Assuming this is indeed the Claimants’ argument, it is clear that they
are not alleging any new breach, but only re-characterizing the breach of the
“reasonable commercial efforts” obligation. It cannot be that breach of the
“reasonable commercial efforts obligation” can be equally read as “non-performance
of the reasonable commercial efforts obligation”. In any event, this is not what the
Claimants have demonstrated.

190

438.

439.

440.

441.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants have failed to prove
that the Respondents had ceased to perform their obligations under the AAs between
February and 30 April 2007. Accordingly, there is no basis for the Respondents’
liability under Articles 1264 and 1271 of the VCC.

The Tribunal acknowledges that it may also need to address the question of whether
the Respondents’ participation in the migration negotiations constituted a breach of
their “reasonable commercial efforts” obligation. However, in the Tribunal’s view, it is
clear that any migration, forced or otherwise, would only have taken place pursuant to
the 2007 Nationalization Decree.®* Therefore, even assuming, for the sake of
argument, that the Respondents did “force” the Claimants to migrate, answering this
question is not crucial or in any event sufficient, as the Respondents’ liability will turn
on their “compliance with law” and/or “causation” defense. Therefore, the Tribunal
considers that rather than opining on this allegation at the present juncture, it is
apposite to consider the Parties’ arguments in the context of the Respondents’
defense of “compliance with law”.®3

Lastly, with respect to the third time period, i.e. 1 May 2007 onwards, the Tribunal
notes that it is not disputed that the AAs were not performed on and from the date of
the Expropriation on 1 May 2007. Thus, it follows that as from the Expropriation on 1
May 2007, the Respondents have arguably breached their obligation to perform the
AAs under Venezuelan law.®4 Be that as it may, the views recorded above regarding
the implications of the Respondents’ compliance with law and causation defenses
would be equally applicable to the Respondents’ liability for non-performance in the
third period. In the circumstances, the Tribunal must determine whether the
Respondents are precluded from liability for any reason, a question which the
Tribunal shall turn to next.

Conclusion

In sum, the Tribunal concludes with respect to the Second Willful Breach Claim that:
(i) the Respondents were obligated to perform the AAs and the Guarantees under
Venezuelan law; (ii) there is no question of non-performance of the AAs and the

°82 2007 Nationalization Decree, C-166, Articles 1, 3 and 5.
683 Infra, §§ 443-474.

684 The Tribunal notes that the AAs were purportedly terminated and all rights and assets in the Projects formally
transferred to PDVSA on 8 October 2007, pursuant to the “Law on the Effects of the Process of Migration to
Mixed Companies of the Agreements of the Orinoco Oil Belt” (See SoC, § 141; Law on the Effects of the Process
of Migration into Mixed Companies of the Association Agreements of the Orinoco Oil Belt, as well as the
Exploration at Risk and Profit Sharing Agreements, Official Gazette No. 38,785, published on 8 October 2007, C-
198). Therefore between May 2007 and October 2007, neither Party can be said to have performed the AAs.

444,

Guarantees in the period prior to February 2007 as nothing to this effect has been
alleged by the Claimants; (iii) there is no non-performance by the Respondents
between February and 30 April 2007 as the Claimants have failed to prove any
actions by the Respondents that amount to “non-performance”; (iv) the only non-
performance is as of 1 May 2007. However, this conclusion is not in any way
dispositive of the Respondents’ liability, which rather turns on them successfully
demonstrating that their liability is rightfully precluded.

Accordingly, the Tribunal now turns to the next issue, namely, whether the
Respondents’ purported liability for participating in the migration negotiations from
February 2007 and their liability for non-performance of the AAs and the Guarantees
from 1 May 2007 is precluded on any grounds.

Is the Respondents’ liability precluded on any grounds?

Having studied the Parties’ submissions on the potential preclusion of the
Respondents’ liability, the Tribunal found them rather convoluted. In a nutshell, the
Respondents raise two grounds on the basis of which they claim that their liability for
any breach must be precluded: (i) the lack of any fault as they were acting in
compliance with the law (i.e., element (iii) of the civil liability test); and (ii) the absence
of a causal link between their purported breaches and the Claimants’ loss (i.e.,
element (v) of the civil liability test). It is in the context of the second ground (i.e. the
element of causation) that the Respondents contend that the law, namely the 2007
Nationalization Decree, was a non-attributable external cause as it was passed by the
Government and therefore acts as a break in the causal link between the
Respondents’ actions and the Claimants’ loss. The Claimants, on the other hand,
take a completely different track. In their view, “non-attributable external cause”
implicates the element of “fault”, inasmuch as the 2007 Nationalization Decree will
only spare the Respondents of liability if it was external and not attributable to them.
In light of what appear to be arguments that are somewhat intertwined, the Tribunal
considers it prudent to first clarify the Parties’ positions and the issues they raise,

before proceeding to its assessment of such issues.

The main thrust of the Respondents’ defense against the Willful Breach Claims is that
their liability under Venezuelan law, if any, is precluded because all of their actions
were undertaken in compliance with law, i.e. the 2007 Nationalization Decree. Thus

192

the Respondents argue that their liability is precluded due to the absence of fault, i.e.,
the third element of civil liability test.°°°

445. The Respondents cite numerous authorities to the effect that, “whoever causes
damage to another through an act that in other circumstances would have every
appearance of fault, would not be liable if he acted under a legal mandate [...] since
the action he has performed is not unlawful but, on the contrary, perfectly legal.”
Thus, the Respondents argue that they had no other option but to carry out the
migration and consequent Expropriation of the Projects as this was mandated by the
2007 Nationalization Decree.®” In their view, one of the essential elements of civil
liability i.e. ‘fault’ on their part, is absent in this case. To buttress this argument, they
add that in any event, they are required to act in accordance with the directions and
policies of the Government — a fact which the Claimants were well aware of when
they invested in the Projects.%®°

446. The Claimants reply that the Respondents’ above attempt to cast itself in the role of
an “innocent bystander” is surreal.

447. First, they re-characterize the Respondents’ “compliance with law” defense as an
hecho del principe. Claimants’ expert, Prof. Brewer-Carias, explains the concept of
hecho del principe and why it is the same as “compliance with law’, as follows:

[W]hen one party allege[s] that [it] is complying with a law in order to not comply
with contractual obligation, this is an excuse of noncompliance, and [...] it is in
relation to an act of Government, it is exactly the same as the theory of fait du
prince as an extraneous non-attributable cause that can excuse the compliance
of contractual obligations. So, [hecho del principe] is the same [as compliance
with law, but] with another name.®89

448. In light of the above, the Claimants interpret the Respondents’ defense as seeking to
escape liability on the basis that there is no breach. According to the Claimants, the

Respondents’ approach is therefore misguided, as the compliance with law defense

cannot under any circumstances undo the existence of the breach itself. Rather, the
compliance with law defense excuses fault.69°

On this basis, the Claimants argue that in order to escape liability on the strength of a
hecho del principe or a fait du prince, the Respondents must establish that such
hecho del principe/ fait du prince was “an extraneous non-attributable cause that can
excuse the compliance of contractual obligations”. Put differently, according to the
Claimants, in order to escape liability it is not enough for the Respondents to merely
establish that they were acting “in compliance with the law’, they must also show that

such law was a non-attributable extraneous cause.°°"

According to the Respondents however, ‘hecho del principe’ or “non-attributable
extraneous cause” goes to the element of “causation” (i.e. the final element of the civil
liability test). The Respondents contend that “the debtor may have committed a
breach, but no liability arises from that breach because the hecho del principe breaks
the chain of causation between the breach and the damage.”®°? On this premise, the
Respondents’ purportedly use hecho del principe as an additional defense to show
the absence of causation, namely that the 2007 Nationalization Decree being an act
of the Government, broke the causal link to the damages suffered. They argue that
even assuming their role in procuring the 2007 Nationalization Decree were to be
considered a cause in fact, their actions do not satisfy the legal standard/test of

causation under Venezuelan law.

Having studied the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal considers that regardless of the
terminology employed by the Parties, in order for the Respondents’ liability for non-
performance of the AAs and the Guarantees to be precluded, the Respondents have
to establish that any fault on their part was the result of a ‘non-attributable external
cause’, both in fact and in law.®% This conclusion results from Article 1271 of the

690 C-PHB, § 350. There had been some debate on the effect of the compliance with law defense, which led the
Tribunal to seek a clarification from the Parties as to the differences between ‘compliance with law’ and ‘hecho del
principe’ in so far as their effect on contractual liability is concerned. Although it appears at first blush that there is
some divergence in views, upon closer examination of the Parties’ responses, both Parties appear to agree in
principle on the effect of a ‘compliance with law’ defense. The Respondents’ answer to the Tribunal’s question in
this regard was that the “defense of compliance with law relates to the element of fault [and that i]f compliance
with law is established, it precludes a finding of contractual [...] liability.” Along the same lines, the Claimants
respond that the “[c]ompliance with law’ defense [...] excuses fault (culpa) and thus liability for breach”. Thus the
divergence, if there should be one, appears to be with regard to the correct place in the civil liability test to assess
the relevance of “non-attributable external cause”. See R-PHB, § 440; Claimants’ Responses to Tribunals
Questions, C-PHB, Appendix A, p. 3 Question 2(b), para 7.

VCC, which provides that a debtor shall be required to pay damages for non-
performance of an obligation, “unless he proves that the non-performance [...] arises
from an external cause not attributable to him”.°*

In sum, even if the Tribunal accepts that the Respondents’ actions after the 2007
Nationalization Decree were taken pursuant to the provisions of this Decree — and
this fact does not appear to be disputed by the Parties®5 — the only way for the
Respondents to avoid liability is by establishing that the 2007 Nationalization Decree
was non-attributable and external to them.

As far as the burden of proof is concerned, the Parties do not dispute that the burden
of proving that the 2007 Nationalization Decree is a non-attributable external cause,
rests with the Respondents, who seek to invoke this defense.®°

The Parties’ submissions having been thus clarified, the issues that the Tribunal shall
proceed to examine in the context of the Respondents’ defenses to liability are, (i)
whether the 2007 Nationalization Decree, is as a matter of fact, not-attributable and
external to the Respondents; and (ii) assuming that the 2007 Nationalization Decree
is not external and attributable to the Respondents, is it the “cause in law” or the
legally sufficient cause of the Claimants’ losses.

i Is the 2007 Nationalization Decree_not_attributable_and_external_to_the
Respondents, as a matter of fact?

In order to establish that the 2007 Nationalization Decree is a non-attributable
external cause (or causa extrafia no imputable) as a matter of fact, the following
elements must be satisfied, namely, (i) the act occurs after the parties enter into the
contract; (ii) it is unavoidable, unforeseeable, and irresistible; (iii) it occurs in the total
absence of fault of the defendant; and (iv) it renders performance absolutely
impossible.*9”

The Claimants’ expert, Prof. Brewer-Carias, stated during the Hearing that:

[The 2007 Nationalization Decree] couldn't be extraneous to PdVSA, first, due
to the organic link between the controller of the public enterprises and the
controlled public enterprise, particularly in the oil sector. And, second, due to

the fact that the Minister acting defining these policies and proposing the
Decree-Law was at the same time the President of PAVSA.59°
457. Elaborating on this idea further, the Claimants submit three independent grounds as
to why the 2007 Nationalization Decree cannot be extraneous to PDVSA: either (i) it
was for the specific purpose of conferring a financial benefit on the State-entity i.e.
PDVSA, in which case, there is a presumption of non-extraneousness; or (ii) the
Government and the State-entity have become organically linked; or (iii) the state-
owned entity, PDVSA, contributed to the issuance of the 2007 Nationalization

Decree.

458. In light of the Tribunal’s finding that the Respondents did not procure the 2007
Nationalization Decree, the examination of the third ground mentioned above can be
dispensed with. In any event, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants’ arguments once
again rely on the “dual hats” worn by Mr. Ramirez and Dr. Mommer. As already
determined above, in the Tribunal’s view the Claimants’ “dual hat” theory does not
withstand scrutiny. Accordingly, the Tribunal will only assess the arguments made on
the first two grounds.

459. As regards the first ground (that the 2007 Nationalization Decree was for the specific
purpose of conferring a financial benefit on the Respondents), the Claimants rely on
the Béckstiegel Guidelines’ to determine whether the hecho del principe defense is
available in this case.”°' Pursuant to these Guidelines, the distinction between a State
and a state-enterprise can be ignored and the hecho del principe defense discarded if
it is obvious that the State exercises its sovereign powers with the clear aim of
modifying contractual obligations and/or extricating the state-entity from liability.”°2

460. The Claimants submit that the Béckstiegel Guidelines’ approach of focusing on the
nature and the purpose of the State act has been widely applied and accordingly
anydefenses have been rejected when the sovereign act was for the benefit of the

State-entity.”° In a similar vein, given that the purpose of the 2007 Nationalization
Decree was to ensure that the entire financial benefit of the AAs flowed only to the
Respondents and could then be applied towards Government spending, the
Claimants conclude that the Respondents cannot invoke compliance with law or
hecho del principe.

As to the second ground (that the Respondents and the Government are organically
linked), the Claimants rely on the decision in Air France’ to argue that the
Government and PDVSA had become organically linked, such that the 2007
Nationalization Decree was not extraneous to the Respondents. According to the
Claimants’ expert, Prof. Brewer-Carias, “it is impossible to say that an act of the
Minister of Energy and Mines would be extraneous to the main company that acts in
the oil sector in Venezuela, and even less if the President of the company is at the
same time the minister.””°5

Pertinently, this organic link is not merely anchored on the Claimants’ “dual hat”
theory. The Claimants’ expert, Prof. Brewer-Carias, has also pointed to other criteria
which, in his view, lead to the undeniable conclusion that PDVSA was inextricably
linked with the State:

i. PDVSA and its subsidiaries became “integrated into the national Public
Administration” and “subject to [...] political and administrative control by the
National Executive.”

ii. PDVSA’s By-laws are themselves an act of Presidential authority, and state
that the National Executive Power, through the Ministry of Energy and Mines,
will set policies, guidelines, and other provisions for PDVSA.

iii. All capital stock of PDVSA is provided by the “Republic of Venezuela,” and all
the shares of PDVSA, according to Article 303 of the Constitution, are and

must remain the ownership of the Republic.

iv. The By-laws provide that the “Ministry of Energy and Mines and other
Ministries that may be appointed from time to time by the President of the
Republic shall exercise the representation of the Republic in the Shareholders’
Meeting, which shall be presided over by the Ministry of Energy and Mines.”

v. PDVSA’s board of directors comprises government officials and appointees.

vi. PDVSA and the Government cooperated to use oil revenues to support the

Government and further PDVSA’s activities.’°

In light of the above, the Claimants submit that the relationship of ownership and
control after 2003 clearly constitutes an organic link between the Government and
PDVSA, which precludes a finding that the 2007 Nationalization Decree was

extraneous.

The Respondents reply that each of the three elements necessary to ascertain that
the 2007 Nationalization Decree was non-attributable and external to the
Respondents “are all present [in this case]”.”°” Regarding the Claimants’ reliance on
the Béckstiegel Guidelines and the Air France decision, the Respondents submit as
follows:

o The Béckstiegel Guidelines have been misapplied in the instant case. Quoting the
Guidelines in full,’°° the Respondents point out that the Claimants rely on the
wrong rule therein. In their view, the rule cited by the Claimants — to argue that the
acts of the Government are not extraneous if they are for the benefit of the state-
entity — is only applicable to administrative acts of the State’s executive organs.
Where the State act is a ‘law of general application’ the Guidelines provide that by
definition this law will be recognized as a force majeure, unless the private
enterprise supplies prima facie evidence that the State passed such a law so that
it could escape fulfilling its contractual obligations.”

o The Air France decision is not applicable in the instant case. That case did not
involve a State act, but the decision of a supervising authority which was in fact
“organically related with the normal operations” of the State-entity, which is why
the decision of such an authority was not considered external to the State-entity

ie. Air France. The Respondents further contend that the reliance on the hecho
del principe or fait du prince is misplaced because these doctrines permit the
private contracting party to seek damages from its co-contracting State party,
when the latter makes the performance of the contract more burdensome
pursuant to its own actions. A contrario, it cannot apply when the measure at
issue emanates from a public entity which is not a party to the contract.’!° Thus,
given that the present case involves “an act by the National Government via the
Legislative Branch” and not by “PDVSA” the latter is released from any

responsibility.”""

To begin with, the Tribunal is not convinced that any of the legal principles cited by
the Claimants apply to the determination of the present question. The Claimants’
expert, Prof. Brewer-Carias seeks to import the Béckstiegel Guidelines and French
jurisprudence on the grounds that they are general principles of law, considering that
Article 4 of the VCC allows recourse to general principles of law. However, such
reliance on Article 4 is questionable at best. Article 4 of the VCC insofar as it is

relevant provides that:

[...] When there is no specific provision in the Law to apply, the provisions that

regulate similar cases or analogous subject matters shall be considered; and, if

there were still any doubt, the general principles of the law will apply.”'2
It appears evident to the Tribunal that one cannot simply rely on ‘general principles of
law’ at will. Such recourse is only permitted if there is no specific provision of law to
apply, nor any provisions that can be applied by analogy. The Claimants have not
shown this to be the case. Equally, the Claimants have not shown that either the
Bockstiegel Guidelines or the Air France principles have been accepted in
Venezuelan law, i.e. the applicable law in the present arbitration; as a matter of fact,
relying on French doctrine, as persuasive as it may be, is almost an admission that
there would not be any Venezuelan authorities to the same effect. In the
circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants have sought to paint Article
4 of the VCC with a very broad brush, and the relevance of the authorities they cite is
simply not tenable. Having said that, the Tribunal in any event agrees with the

Respondents that both of these authorities are misapplied.

The Béckstiegel Guidelines, insofar as they are relevant, provide as follows:

A. Acts of state in the form of administrative acts

1. Due to the presumption that a state will not have its executive organs
act to the detriment of its own foreign trade organs, including state enterprises,
administrative acts of state should in principle not be considered as force
majeure.

2. This presumption is not applied, however, if it can be seen prima facie
or can be proved by the state enterprise that the administrative act was caused
by general considerations not connected with this contract or this sort of

contract.

3. In spite of rule 2 the presumption under 1 is applicable again, if the
private party proves that in its specific case the general considerations did not
apply.

B. Acts of state in the form of law

1. If it is not a general law but a law for an individual case, the same rules

apply as under A.

2. A general law, due to its per definitionem general character, will in
principle have to be recognized as force majeure.

3. Rule B2 does not apply, however, if the private enterprise supplies at

least prima facie evidence that it was in the interest of the state not to fulfil its

contractual obligations which was the motivation of the law.”13
Evidently, the Claimants are mistaken in their reliance on Part A of the Guidelines
which pertains to the treatment of the administrative acts of one state organ
(executive organs) vis-a-vis another (trade organs including state-entities). As
admitted by the Claimants’ expert Prof. Brewer-Carias, none of the laws at issue in
the present case were administrative acts.’”'* They were all “acts of the State in the
form of law’ which are clearly governed by Part B of the Guidelines and are thus
subject to force majeure or analogous defenses, if they are of general application.’
The Claimants’ obvious reliance on the wrong guideline brings their argument
regarding the relevance and applicability of the Bockstiegel Guidelines up short.

In any event, the exception under rule B3 would also not come to the Claimants’
assistance as the purpose of the 2007 Nationalization Decree was not to renege from
the Respondents’ contractual obligations. The 2007 Nationalization Decree first and

foremost envisaged continued participation of foreign oil companies, but subject to an
altered shareholding and company structure. It was only in the event that the Parties
were unable to agree on the migration of the association to mixed enterprises that the
2007 Nationalization Decree envisaged the taking of the Project.’'®

As regards the Claimants’ reliance on the Air France decision, the Tribunal agrees
with the Respondents that the decision therein is distinguishable from the present
case. In that case, the obligation to pay Air France personnel was assumed by
Compagnie Air-France itself, albeit with the assent of its regulatory authority, pursuant
to an approval granted by the same regulatory authority.’7 Subsequently, the same
regulatory authority hindered performance of the contract. It is in this context, that the
Cour de Cassation held that:

[As the] modalities of determination of the salaries of [flight personnel] have

been validly fixed by Compagnie Air-France with the approval of the Regulatory

Authority [...] the subsequent irregular intervention of this authority in an

attempt, as such, to hinder the performance of the obligation [...] cannot be

opposed by [Air-France] subject to such regulation [being] an unforeseeable

and insurmountable act of a third party external to it.”
As Respondents’ expert, Prof. Garcia Montoya rightly pointed out during the Hearing,
the implication of this distinction is that the administrative act in question, which
hindered performance of the contract, was enacted by the same entity which was a
party to the contract. In the present case however, the act in question i.e. the 2007
Nationalization Decree, is an act of the Government and moreover, the Government
is not a party to the AAs and the Guarantees.

Further, much ado has been made about the criteria developed in the Air France
decision to indicate the existence of an organic link between the State and the state-
entity. Although it may appear at first blush, that the facts in this case fit neatly within
this criteria, the Tribunal is unable to accede to this checklist approach. The
generality of the conditions elaborated in the Air France case would result in a
situation where every state-entity would be equivalent to the State. As a result, any
and every act of the State would without exception be treated as an act of the state-
entity and the compliance with law defense would be rendered a virtual dead letter. In

the Tribunal’s view, such a position cannot be countenanced in the facts of the
present case.

The Tribunal has already previously confirmed that the Respondents were not
involved in procuring the 2007 Nationalization Decree. Additionally, the Tribunal notes
that in their reliance on Air France, the Claimants appear to accept that the
Respondents are mandated to follow the dictats of the Chavez Administration
pursuant to PDVSA’s Articles of Association and By-laws.7'9 It would therefore follow
that the consequences of the 2007 Nationalization Decree were “unavoidable,
irresistible and rendered performance of the AAs and the Guarantees impossible”. In
the circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the 2007 Nationalization Decree was
indeed external and not attributable to the Respondents. Accordingly, at the very
least, the Respondents are not at fault, which consequently precludes their liability for
non-performance of the AAs and the Guarantees.

The Tribunal is of the view that the above determination is dispositive of the
remaining case on willful breach. As the Tribunal has concluded that the
Respondents’ actions were not in any way the factual cause of the Claimants’ losses
it is not necessary for the Tribunal to examine the Parties’ remaining arguments on
causation. However, for the sake of completeness, the Tribunal proposes to address
the Respondents’ argument that they are in any event, not liable due to the absence
of a causal link between their purported breaching conduct and the damages suffered
by the Claimants.

ji. Is the 2007 Nationalization Decree the “cause in law” of the Claimants’ loss?

The nub of the Respondents’ argument on this issue is that regardless of any
purported involvement in procuring the 2007 Nationalization Decree, they remain free
from liability, as their alleged breaching conduct is not the /egally sufficient cause of
the Claimants’ loss. Accordingly, this issue requires the Tribunal to assess whether
any purported breach by the Respondents satisfies the legal standard of causation
under Venezuelan law. Both Parties disagree on the legal standard of causation that
is applicable under Venezuelan law.

The Respondents submit that the standard of causation prevalent under Venezuelan
law, is that of “adequate causation” or “efficient/preponderant causation’. Relying on

719 Supra, § 462.

202

477.

478.

479.

480.

various authorities on Venezuelan law, the Respondents explain this standard as
follows:

Among the theories that try to explain the scope of the [...] causal link [...] the
theory of adequate causation [...] states that among the chain of events that
determine the damage it is not correct to follow the standard of culpable act or
the proximate act, nor that of the triggering event. But it must be determined
which of the events of the chain is legally adequate to cause the
damage.’2°

As to the test for determining the legally adequate cause, the Respondents submit

that:

[tlo identify the cause of the damage [...] [t]he following question must be

answered: is the action or omission of the allegedly liable party in and of itself

capable of normally producing such damage? [I]f the answer is affirmative,

it must be concluded that such condition is adequate and thus the cause of the

damage; if the answer is negative, then we are dealing with a simple concurrent

condition and not with the cause.’21
Applying this test to the facts of the present case, the Respondents submit that the
legally adequate cause of the Claimants’ loss was evidently the 2007 Nationalization
Decree which was, and could only, have been enacted by the Government. Even
assuming the Respondents had any purported role to play in procuring the enactment
of the Decree, the fact remains that such action was not in and of itself normally
capable of causing the Claimants any loss and the Respondents are consequently
absolved of liability.’22

In contrast, the Claimants submit that the test for causation is set out in Article 1275
of the VCC which provides that:

Even if failure to comply with the obligation is a result of willful misconduct,
damages related to the loss suffered by the creditor and the profits of which he
has been deprived, shall not exceed those that are the immediate and direct
consequence of the failure to perform the obligation.’23
Accordingly, they contend that the test to be applied is ‘did Respondent’s non-
performance of the AAs and Guarantees directly cause to [sic] the Claimants’

loss?’74 The Claimants then go on to contend that causation under Article 1275 is not

restricted to any particular theory of causation.’?5 Their expert, Prof. Brewer-Carias,
explains that “the [VCC] does not impose the need to identify one specific cause. If it
is a chain of acts that are the cause of the willful breach, then all are part of the
cause.” Next, the Claimants’ other expert Prof. Mata Borjas states that “the discretion
of the judge is paramount’ to any theory [of causation] and that ‘the purpose of the
causation analysis...is not to apply a rigid formula...but rather to arrive at an
appropriate outcome that reflects reality.” Thus, the Claimants essentially argue for

a “case-by-case” analysis of causation.

In light of this standard of causation, the Claimants’ case against the Respondents

appears to be that:

[T]he Government could not have nationalized the petroleum industry,
expropriated the Projects, and destroyed the AAs without PDVSA’s willing
involvement. Had the Chavez Government been able to nationalize and operate
the entire petroleum industry in Venezuela with “old” PDVSA still in place, it
would have done so. But it could not. PDVSA’s clashes with the Government
from 1998 to 2001, and its labour strike in opposition to the Government's initial
efforts to politicize the company in 2002, demonstrated that the Government
could not accomplish its objectives without a “new” PDVSA. [And i]t was only
with the willful and active participation of “new PDVSA” that Claimants’
dispossessions were possible.’2”
The Claimants’ thus conclude that the Respondents cannot now argue that the 2007
Nationalization Decree is only attributable to the Government and is a supervening

act that breaks the chain of causation of the Claimants’ losses.

Against this backdrop, the Tribunal will first determine the applicable standard of
causation under Venezuelan law and second determine if the Respondents’ actions

satisfy this legal standard.

The Tribunal is unable to follow the Claimants’ interpretation of Article 1275 of the
VCC and their “case-by-case” or “discretionary” theory of causation. The Claimants
make a rather expansive claim that “all commentators agree [that Article 1275] is not
restricted by any particular theory of causation”. However, they provide little basis for
this statement.’8 Moreover, the strength of the Claimants’ submission on the
standard of causation is belied by the testimony of their own expert witness. When
questioned on causation during the Hearing, Prof. Mata Borjas admitted that although

different commentators from different jurisdictions used different terminology, by and
large, Venezuelan Courts and commentators have adopted the “adequate causation”
test. It also appears to the Tribunal from this testimony, that the “discretion” the
Claimants speak of, does not pertain to which theory of causation is applicable, but
rather to the manner in which the Tribunal applies this theory to the facts of a specific

case.729

Q. But, Professor, did you adopt the adequate causation?
A. | used that word in my First Report, yes.
Q. So, did that mean that you were adopting the adequate causation test?

A. | used the word, and for the purpose of my conclusions, | used the standard

standards of ordinary causation because--

[el

A. Let me put it in very simple words. Number 1, there is a touchstone under
Venezuelan law. The rule of law at play here is the application or it's for this
Tribunal to apply or not to apply Article 1275. That's Number 1. Now, Article
1275 [...] it's the notion that the damage must be the direct and immediate
consequence of the alleged conduct. Having said that, it is for the Tribunal
or for any court handling a "responsibilidad civil" claim to analyze and to
interpret that rule of law. In doing so, according to Venezuelan law, the
rule of interpretation is stated under Article 4 of the Venezuelan Civil
Code, which states that the interpreter of a rule of law in Venezuela have
to first go to the words chosen by the lawmaker, but not stay with the
words alone because, again, as it is the case with contracts, the purpose
of the Interpreter is to determine the intent of the lawmaker, of the
legislator. In this case, it is for this Tribunal to determine whether the
damages is to direct an immediate sequence. That has to be made with
discretion. It has to be made on a case by case basis. The circumstances,
the specific circumstances are for the Tribunal, not for me, to determine. In so
doing, the Tribunal may choose between different theories. Secondly, that is to
be done on a case by case basis, and then you have several decisions and
several Italian authors making an identity between the theory of adequate
causation with the theory of regular causation.

 

Q. I'm sorry to interrupt. | just want to ask you a very simple question: Isn't
adequate causation the theory of causality mostly adopted by Venezuelan
authors?

A. It has been adopted repeatedly by Venezuelan courts.

Q. By courts and authors; right?

A. It has been accepted by Venezuelan courts and Venezuelan authors,

such as probably the two most recognized, Professor Mélich-Orsini and
Professor Gert Kummerow used the expression. Professor Kummerow uses.

expressions such as “the necessary premise.” They use different expressions.
One of them is “adequate causation.””°°
In light of the above, the Tribunal is satisfied that the standard of causation under

Venezuelan law is, as argued by the Respondents, that of adequate causation.

Applying this standard to the facts of the present case, the Tribunal is of the view that
even assuming the Respondents had played any role in procuring the 2007
Nationalization Decree (which the Tribunal has already concluded they did not), their
purported actions were not the adequate, direct or immediate cause of the Claimants’
loss. This is because the ultimate power to enact the 2007 Nationalization Decree
could only have been exercised by the Government. The Respondents’ conduct
would in and of itself not have been sufficient to cause the Claimants any loss. This
has been acknowledged by the Claimants’ expert Prof. Mata Borjas, who confirmed
that the Expropriation could only have taken place through the intervention and
supervening acts of the Government:

Q. [...] My question is: Absent the actions of the President and the National
Assembly, could the interests of Claimants have been nationalized?

A. No, you needed a specific governmental formality, yes.

Q. The actions of the Respondents on their own would have been sufficient to
cause the damages claimed by Claimants?

A.| would have to--need to think about it, but, in this particular case, it's a joint
conduct of Respondents and the Government what was alleged to be the cause

Q. No, but I'm asking you to assume on their own, the actions by the
Respondents on their own, would that have been sufficient to cause the
damage?

A. Based on the Expropriation?

Q. Yes. We're talking about the Expropriation.

A. No, you would need a formality for the Expropriation, you would need a
governmental act. That is correct.”5"
In the circumstances, even assuming that the Claimants had established all other
elements of civil responsibility, the Willful Breach Claims would have failed, as the
Respondents have successfully proved that their purported actions were not the
legally sufficient cause of the Claimants’ losses.

490.

As the remaining arguments (on “disloyal delay”) will not materially alter the Tribunal’s
conclusions, these will not be addressed. The Tribunal does note however, that its
conclusions in respect of the Willful Breach Claims are fortified by the Claimants’
conduct from the date of the first alleged breach in 2004 (the Royalty Measure) till the
actual commencement of the arbitration in 2014. As the Claimants have admitted,
through an entire decade — from 2004 to 2014 — they simply assumed that the
Respondents were aware of the fact that contractual obligations had been breached.
No doubt the Respondents were aware that the Claimants objected to the qualified
measures and the Expropriation. However, complaining about these measures does
not automatically indicate that there have also been contractual breaches, much less
of the specific provisions that the Claimants ultimately came to rely on in their SoC.

This is compounded by the fact that the scope of the Willful Breach Claims has been
constantly changing. In their Request for Arbitration, the Willful Breach Claims were
only based on the “duty of good faith” under Venezuelan law. Then in the SoC, the
Claimants put together some provisions of the AAs which could support their claim.
Importantly though, they did not claim damages for the effects of the Royalty Measure
and the Extraction Tax. Nor did they argue that non-performance of the AAs was itself
a breach. This last argument only took shape at the Hearing and was finally made in
their post-hearing submissions. The Tribunal can only infer from the growth story of
the Willful Breach Claims, that the Claimants themselves were not confident of its
persuasiveness and were building on it as the proceedings progressed. For these
additional reasons, the Tribunal finds little difficulty in dismissing the Willful Breach
Claims in their entirety.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that (i) regardless of whether this relates to the
element of fault or to the element of causation in the civil liability test, in order to
escape liability, the burden lies with the Respondents to prove that the 2007
Nationalization Decree is a “non-attributable external cause”; (ii) the Respondents
have proved that the 2007 Nationalization Decree is not attributable and is external to
them as a matter of fact; and (iii) even assuming that the Respondents played a role
in procuring the 2007 Nationalization Decree, it would not satisfy the test for
causation under Venezuelan law and thus not be the legally sufficient cause of the
Claimants’ alleged losses.

207

4. Conclusion

491. In light of the aforementioned analysis, the Tribunal has come to the following

conclusions regarding the Willful Breach Claims:

The Willful Breach Claims are arbitrable in light of the fact that they are
pertaining to purported breaches of the Respondents’ contractual obligations
arising out of the AAs which are commercial contracts, as opposed to the

mere implementation of the 2007 Nationalization Decree.

In order to establish the Respondents’ liability for willful breach, the following
elements of the civil liability test under Venezuelan law must be satisfied,
namely (i) the existence of an obligation; (ii) breach of the obligation; (iii) fault
and its non-preclusion by an external non-attributable cause; (iv) damages;
and (v) existence of a causal link between the purported breaches and the

resulting damage.

As regards the First Willful Breach Claim concerning the Respondents’
obligation to exercise “reasonable commercial efforts”, the Tribunal finds that
such an obligation exists under the Petrozuata AA. In that regard, Section
9.01(b) of the Petrozuata AA obligated the Respondents to exercise
“reasonable commercial efforts” in order to ensure the success of the
Petrozuata Project and to refrain from any conduct that would hinder the
functioning of the Petrozuata Project. Under Venezuelan law, such an
obligation is classified as an “obligation of means”, meaning that it does not
require the achievement of a specific result, but rather an exercise of due
diligence and care in an effort to achieve the desired result. Furthermore, it is
for the Claimants to prove that such due diligence and care has not been
exercised by the Respondents, thus constituting a breach of their obligation.

iv. Correspondingly, the Tribunal finds that no “reasonable commercial efforts”

obligation exists under the Hamaca AA. In particular, the Tribunal concludes
that the language of Articles 10.4(a) and 10.5(a) of the Hamaca AA is not
broad enough to include an obligation on the part of the Respondents to
“lobby” the Government in order to retain the application of the most favorable

fiscal regime for the Parties and the Projects.

The Tribunal further concludes that the Claimants have failed to prove that the
Respondents did not exercise “reasonable commercial efforts” as required

208

under the Petrozuata AA. In this respect, the Tribunal considers that the “dual
hats” worn by Mr. Ramirez and Dr. Mommer do not automatically result in a
situation where their acts as Ministers of the Government also constituted
actions of PDVSA. Moreover, the position of these individuals in PDVSA did
not give them any special powers to bring about the Overall Expropriation.
Even if Mr. Ramirez and Dr. Mommer had not held such positions in PDVSA,
the Government would have nevertheless remained empowered to enact the
various qualified measures and PDVSA would have remained obligated to
implement such measures pursuant to its Articles of Incorporation and By-

laws.

Accordingly, in relation to the First Willful Breach Claim the Tribunal concludes
that an obligation to exercise reasonable commercial efforts exists under the
Petrozuata AA, but not under the Hamaca AA. However, the Tribunal also
finds that the Claimants have failed to prove the breach of this reasonable
commercial efforts obligation.

ii. As regards the Second Willful Breach Claim — alleging that the Respondents

failed to perform the AAs “during 2007” — the Tribunal finds that an obligation
of performance of contractual obligation per se exists under Article 1271 of the
VCC, such that non-performance amounts to a breach. Moreover, under
Venezuelan law, an obligation of performance is characterized as an
“obligation of result’, such that non-performance creates a presumption of
liability (in contrast to an obligation of means, where liability needs to be
proved).

However, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants fall short of proving the entire
extent of their Second Willful Breach Claim, in that the Claimants have only
successfully proven non-performance of the AAs from the date of the
Expropriation i.e. from 1 May 2007, and not any period prior thereto. In other
words, the Claimants’ allegation that the Respondents stopped performing the
AA's “during 2007” is too broad.

ix. Accordingly, in relation to the Second Willful Breach Claim, the Tribunal

concludes that an obligation to perform the AAs exists under Venezuelan law
(i.e. element (i) of the civil liability test), and the Claimants have proven the
breach of such obligation by the Respondents, but only from the date of the
Expropriation (element (ii) of the civil liability test).

209

493.

494.

x. Furthermore, even though the Respondents have breached their obligation to
perform the AAs, the Tribunal finds that their liability is precluded for the
following reasons. First, the Respondents were acting pursuant to the 2007
Nationalization Decree. This Decree is a non-attributable external cause.
Accordingly, the Respondents were acting in compliance with the law and
their fault is precluded. Second, even assuming the Respondents were
involved in “procuring” the 2007 Nationalization Decree, the Respondents’
actions do not satisfy the legal standard for causation under Venezuelan law
which requires the Claimants to show that the Respondents’ actions were the
“adequate cause” of the losses sustained. Under Venezuelan law it is the
enactment of the various qualified measures by the Government that
constitutes the legally sufficient cause of the Claimants’ loss.

xi. In sum the Tribunal concludes that the Respondents are not liable for willfully
breaching the AAs and the Willful Breach Claims are accordingly dismissed.
HECHO ILicITo

In the alternative, the Claimants argue that the Respondents’ willful destruction of the
AAs also attracts liability under the principle of hecho ilicito enshrined in Article 1185
of the VCC. Article 1185 of the VCC reads:

Whoever intentionally, negligently or recklessly, has caused damage to another

has the obligation to repair it. Similarly, a party who has caused someone else

damage, surpassing in the exercise of his rights the limits established by good

faith, or by the object in light of which that right has been granted, is equally

bound to repair it.”52
In light of the above, the Claimants reiterate the sequence of events leading up to
their dispossession and to the destruction of the AAs. Accordingly, they argue that all
four elements constitutive of an hecho ilicito requiring reparation (i.e. existence of
fault, damage, liability to indemnify, and causation) have been satisfied in the case at
hand.”

The Respondents’ response is three-fold and runs as follows: (i) as a matter of
Venezuelan law, the Claimants cannot assert hecho ilicito alongside their contractual

722 VCC, CER-1, Article 1185.

498.

claim for Willful Breach; (ii) compliance with law cannot constitute tortious conduct;
and (iii) the Claimants do not satisfy the element of causation for hecho ilicito.”34

The Tribunal considers that the Parties’ submissions regarding the Respondents’ first
contention (i.e. that in the present case the AAs preclude a finding of extra-
contractual responsibility) are entirely dispositive of the issue in favor of the
Respondents. Therefore, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to assess the Parties’
remaining submissions on the Respondents’ second and third contentions.

According to the Claimants’ legal expert, Prof. Mata Borjas, there is no rule under
Venezuelan Law preventing a plaintiff from making a claim on grounds of contractual
liability and, in the alternative, on grounds of extra-contractual liability. This is so
given that Article 1185 VCC “establishes the recognized right of the victim to attain
relief from the tortfeasor, without any qualification. There is no restriction that the
victim cannot be a party to a breached contract or that the wrongdoing must differ
from the violation of an agreement”.’*5 In view of this, the Claimants argue that extra-
contractual responsibility for an hecho ilicito can arise despite the existence of a
contractual relationship between a plaintiff and a defendant. For the purposes of both
contractual and extra contractual responsibility, this remains the case irrespective of
whether the questionable “conduct” is the “same” in both scenarios.”°6

The Claimants refer to a number of decisions rendered by Venezuelan courts in
support of their position.’*” Indeed, this case law suggests that, under Venezuelan
law, a claim for extra-contractual responsibility can be admissible despite the
existence of a contractual relationship between the disputing parties. However, this
aspect is not controversial.

It is not the Respondent's position that the mere existence of a contract between two
parties de jure precludes either of them from advancing an extra-contractual claim
(either directly or alternatively) against the other. Rather, in the Respondents’
submission, the issue is whether, despite the existence of a contract binding both
parties, the specific elements of extra-contractual responsibility for an hecho ilicito are
properly ascertained. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondents that

this can only occur if the following two requirements are met: (i) the action taken by
one of the parties involves a violation of a “legal duty independent” from the contract
at hand; and (ii) the damage caused by said action results in the loss of a “patrimonial
or moral benefit distinct from those guaranteed by the contract”.’28

As explained by the Respondents’ legal expert,”°° Prof. Garcia Montoya, in recent
cases the Venezuelan Supreme Court has consistently found the two above criteria
to be decisive in assessing whether a claim for extra-contractual responsibility may
arise in spite of the existence of a contract between the disputing parties.’4° In fact, as
will be further discussed below, the judicial decisions referred to by the Claimants

follow the same view.”4"

As argued by the Claimants, in Petra Pefia the Supreme Court held that, in instances
of a “wrongful act’, there is “a possibility for the claim of both types of contractual and
non-contractual liability” to be “borne of the same legal relationship of the parties [i.e.
a contract]”.”2 However, the Claimants appear to have disregarded the Supreme
Court's eventual finding, by which the identified “wrongful act” stemmed from a
distinct and “demonstrated” case of “fraud”.”4

Similarly, the Supreme Court in Palazzi allowed for both contractual and extra-
contractual claims pursuant to allegations of contractual willful misconduct.”44 In
particular, the Supreme Court affirmed that, when the harmful act results from
criminal behavior or from intentional misconduct, negligence or recklessness, a victim
has the possibility of opting between a contractual and a tortious cause of action.’45
That being said, the Supreme Court conditioned its finding by stating that a party is
entitled to such choice only when the harmful act pertains to “circumstances of
extraordinary occurrence” and not from the “mere breach of contractual provisions”,
concluding that, “in principle, the scopes of contractual and criminal responsibility are

mutually exclusive”.”° In this regard, it should be underlined that Palazzi concerned
moral damages suffered by the plaintiff as a result of admitted gross negligence:
negligence that was deemed sufficient to support criminal liability for manslaughter.’4”

The remaining court rulings referenced by the Claimants fare no differently. First, as
explained by Prof. Garcia Montoya (and in line with the Supreme Court's findings in
Pallazi), the discussion on tortious claims vis-a-vis contractual responsibility in both
Prato and Parra took place in the context of moral damages due to non-contractual
breaches.”48

Second, while in Kassen the High Court of Miranda determined that a contractual
relationship between the parties could not prevent the occurrence of an hecho ilicito,
such statement was not made in a void.”9 In that case, the High Court clarified that:
(i) an “hecho ilicito may well be borne collaterally out of the abusive application of a
specific clause”; and (ii) in order to conclude that a contractual provision had been
abusively applied, its application was required to fall “outside of the limits imposed by
the peaceful contractual good faith, meaning, outside the terms established by Article
1160 of the Venezuelan Civil Code”.’5°

It is noteworthy that the threshold determined in Kassen had already been adopted by
the Supreme Court in Prato years before.’5" Still, the High Court went on to elaborate
that, under Venezuelan law, the abuse of rights is “typically” a “non-contractual
conduct that gives rise to a compensation different from the compensation foreseen
in or foreseeable under the contract”.’52

Overall, the legal authorities relied upon by the Claimants militate against their
position. In all cases, the possibility of bringing an extra-contractual claim, either in
tandem or alternatively to a contractual claim, was essentially assessed against the
two criteria already identified above: (i) whether the breached obligation or implied

términos previstos por el articulo 1.160 del Codigo Civil’).

duty (including contractual good faith, as both authors referred to above say) was
independent from or in excess of the scope of the contract concluded between the
disputing parties; or (ii) whether the damage caused by such breach resulted in a loss
not guaranteed by the contract in question.

In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that, pursuant to Venezuelan law, the
Claimants must cumulatively satisfy both of the foregoing requirements in order to
succeed on their Hecho Ilicito claim. In the Tribunal’s view the Claimants have failed
to meet such a standard.

The Claimants’ positions for Willful Breach and Hecho Ilicito are, for all material and
legally relevant purposes, identical. No substantive differentiation is made in terms of
the circumstances that, according to the Claimants, arguably give rise to the
Respondents’ contractual responsibility under their Willful Breach Claims, or to extra-
contractual responsibility under their Hecho Ilicito claim.

Indeed, the Claimants submit that the elements necessary to establish liability under
Article 1185 of the VCC are comprised of factual, legal, or quantum considerations to
some extent shared with their Willful Breach Claims. For instance, with regard to the
element of fault (which both Party experts agree implies a “wrongdoing” or an action
“contrary to the law),’§* the Claimants specifically refer to their arguments on the
Respondents’ alleged willful breaches of the AAs.” With respect to the element of
causation, the Claimants argue that it is complied with for the same reasons as in the
context of their Willful Breach claim.’55 As to damages, the Claimants once more deal

with the losses allegedly suffered either contractually or extra-contractually, jointly.”°

Put simply, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants have failed to ascertain a
duty allegedly breached by the Respondents which would be different from the
obligations required by the AAs. The Claimants submit that the Respondents
breached their obligation to perform the AAs in good faith in accordance with Article
1160 of the VCC.75” However, as seen, in both Kassen and Prato it was required that,
for a parallel or alternative extra-contractual claim to succeed, the victim must identify
a wrongful act exceeding the scope of implied contractual obligations (i.e. the

contractual good faith mandated by Article 1160 of the VCC).’* The Claimants have

not met such requirement.

Assuming arguendo that the Claimants did point to a legal duty breached by the
Respondents concomitant to or preceding the Expropriation, the Claimants have
nevertheless failed to prove that the alleged damage resulting thereof is not
guaranteed by the AAs. In other words, all of the Claimants’ alleged damages are
limited to the loss of rights or advantages arising under the AAs. In fact, the

Claimants request that the Tribunal declare the Respondents’ “integral role in
destroying the Claimant's contractual rights” capable of constituting an hecho ilicito,
warranting full reparation under Venezuelan law.”° No moral or distinct harm is
claimed for what, in abstracto, could be sought by way of the Respondents’ alleged
contractual liability under the AAs. Thus, in line with Kassen,’®° the compensation
requested by the Claimants for their Hecho Ilicito claim is no different from the

compensation foreseen under the AAs pursuant to their Willful Breach claim.

Lastly, the Tribunal is aware that, according to the Claimants’ expert, Prof. Mata
Borjas, “a claimant may indeed concurrently assert contractual and extra-contractual
liability where the respondent has engaged in, for example, an ‘abuse of rights’ [...].”
The Claimants’ legal expert goes on to affirm that, “on the Claimants’ case,
Respondents’ willful destruction of the Claimants’ Project Interests would satisfy the
standard of ‘abuse of rights’ under Venezuelan law”.’6' Nonetheless, Prof. Mata
Borjas’ observation is untenable for the following reasons.

First, the Claimants have not made such an explicit submission on ‘abuse of rights’ in
either their oral or written pleadings in the context of their Willful Breach claim.
Second, the opinion of Prof. Mata Borjas is unsubstantiated. The expert fails to make
any references to Venezuelan law equating the notion of willful breach with the
‘abuse of rights’ doctrine. Third, neither Prof. Mata Borjas nor the Claimants have
identified a legal right held by the Respondents whose exercise must be deemed an
abuse. Fourth, the Claimants have in any event failed to substantiate how the
damages resulting from such an alleged ‘abuse of rights’ (assuming it were to exist)
could give rise to losses not guaranteed or recoverable through the AAs themselves.

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimants’ claim for the
Respondents’ extra-contractual responsibility for the occurrence of an hecho ilicito, in
its entirety.

THE COUNTERCLAIM

Respondent Corpoguanipa’® has raised a counterclaim under the Hamaca AA for a
declaration that, in the event it is found liable for DAs under the Hamaca AA it will be
entitled to exercise the option provided under the Hamaca AA, to purchase Claimant
Phillips’ rights and interests in the Hamaca Project. The Claimants dispute both the
legality of the counterclaim and the method adopted by the Respondents for its
valuation. The Tribunal therefore proposes to first examine Parties’ arguments on the
legality of the counterclaim, and only in the event it is upheld, will the Tribunal

examine the arguments on valuation.
The Respondents’ position

The Respondents contend that pursuant to Articles 14.4 and 14.5 of the Hamaca AA,
they are entitled to purchase or “buy-out” the Claimants’ “Project Interests”’® in the
Hamaca Project as an alternative to paying compensation for DAs pursuant to an
award made in the Claimants’ favour’ (Articles 14.4 and 14.5 are hereinafter
collectively referred to as the “Buy-Out Provisions” and the option to purchase the
Claimants’ interest is hereinafter referred to as the “Buy Out Option’.). The
Respondents submit that “Project Interest” as defined in the Hamaca AA is not
restricted to the Claimants’ shareholding in the Hamaca Project, but extends to all
“rights, titles, interests and obligations” relating thereto. As such, they contend that
the definition is broad enough to permit them to acquire the Claimants’ “claim for
compensation” made in the present arbitration.”

In support of the above interpretation, the Respondents rely on the negotiating history
of the Hamaca AA’® and more particularly the HCA which stipulates that remedies

understood to mean Respondent Corpoguanipa. Similarly, all references to “Claimants” shall be

764 See SoD, §§ 325-334; Rejoinder, §§ 364-371. See also Terms of Reference, § 40 (Respondents’ arguments).
Articles 14.4 and 14.5 of the Hamaca AA are set out at §§ 525-529 infra. There is no buy-out or related provision
in the Petrozuata AA, and thus this issue relates only to the Hamaca AA.

for DAs in the form of either compensation or amendments to the provisions of the
Hamaca AA would be “without prejudice to the option for [Respondents], according to
the provisions of the Association Agreement, to purchase such participation of the
[Claimants] on equitable conditions”.”°”

Countering the Claimants’ contentions that the Buy-Out Option apply only in case of
DAs pursuant to which the Hamaca Project remains a going concern (and not a case
like the present, where the Hamaca Project has been expropriated and there is
nothing left to “buy-out”), the Respondents submit that there is no basis for drawing
such a distinction in the text of the Buy-Out Provisions. Given that the definition of a
DA in the Hamaca AA expressly includes “expropriation of the assets of, or a Party’s
interest in, the Association or Association Entities’, in the Respondents’ view the
Claimants’ argument is unsustainable.”°° Accordingly, the Respondents submit that
they are entitled to buy out the Claimants’ interests in the Hamaca Project — i.e. any
potential award of compensation obtained in this arbitration — in the event an award of
compensation is made in the Claimants’ favour.

The Claimants’ position

In response, the Claimants argue that “[t}he Counter-Claim is no more than an
opportunistic afterthought by the Respondents, and should be dismissed as such.””6°
They submit first that the Buy-Out Provisions are not relevant to the Willful Breach
Claims because the Respondents’ liability for willful breach is governed by
Venezuelan contract law and not Article 14 of the Hamaca AA; and second, that it
cannot be invoked in respect of the DA Claims because there is nothing left to “buy-
out”. As the Tribunal has dismissed the Willful Breach Claims and upheld the DA
Claims, only the arguments pertaining to the latter will be considered.

The Claimants argue that the text and structure of the Buy-Out Provisions leaves no
doubt that the Buy-Out Option was intended to apply only in a situation where the
Hamaca Project remained a going concern and not, as is the instant case, where the
Claimants’ interest in the Project has been expropriated over 10 years ago and there
is nothing left to “buy out”.

520. Drawing the Tribunal’s attention to various clauses in Article 14.4 and 14.57”, the
Claimants submit that these provisions were structured in a specific way. First they
envisaged multiple opportunities for the Parties to agree upon amendments to the
terms of the Hamaca AA in the event of a DA. Secondly, they contemplated the
possibility for the Claimants to maintain the AAs and their interests therein, by
relinquishing their DA claim before the Buy-Out Provisions were triggered. According
to the Claimants all of these provisions would be rendered meaningless if, as the

Respondents claim, the Buy-Out Option could also operate after an Expropriation.””'

521. The Claimants also argue that the Respondents’ attempt to buy out the Claimants’
claim for compensation contradicts the framework and structure of the Buy-Out
Provisions, which envisage the option to either pay damages or to purchase the
Claimants’ Project Interest and not both. According to the Claimants, the
Respondents are attempting to “compel a forced sale of [Claimants’] interest in the
Hamaca Project years after the expropriation of that interest [...] and [to permit the
Respondents to do so] would produce an absurd and highly inequitable result that

ignores the plain terms of the AA”.’72
3. Relevant provisions of the Hamaca AA

522. In their submissions, both Parties have emphasized the text of the Buy-Out
Provisions.’”3 Accordingly, the Tribunal shall first set out the relevant provisions which
are at issue in the counterclaim, namely Articles 14.4 and 14.5 of the Hamaca AA.

523. As elaborated above,’” in the event the Parties agree that a DA resulting in MAE has
occurred, then pursuant to Articles 14.1(a) and 14.3(c), the Parties are required to
enter into good faith negotiations regarding suitable amendments to the terms of the
Hamaca AA, that would compensate the Claimants for the damages they have

suffered as a result of the DAs.’

524. The Buy-Out Provisions come into play in the event the Parties are unable to agree
that a DA resulting in MAE has occurred or in the event that they are unable to agree
upon amendments to the Hamaca AA. In such a situation, Articles 14.4(a) and (b)
enable the Parties to enter into a two phased arbitration, wherein in the first phase,
the arbitral tribunal will determine if a DA resulting in a MAE has occurred, and if so,
the consequent damages suffered by the Claimants.’’° If a DA resulting in MAE has
occurred, then in the second phase, the Parties can also seek the determination of a
“Buy-Out Price” for purchasing the Claimants’ “Project Interest”. The provisions to the

extent relevant, are set out below:

(a) In the event that [Corpoguanipa] and the [Claimants] do not come to full
agreement on whether Discriminatory Actions resulting in a Material Adverse
Effect have occurred, or the Parties do not come to full agreement on the
Amendments, within six (6) months of delivery of a Notice of Triggering Event,
[Corpoguanipa], or the [Claimants] shall be entitled to commence arbitration
proceedings in accordance with Section 17.2. The arbitration proceedings shall
be bifurcated, with the panel first considering whether the [Claimants] had
suffered a Material Adverse Effect as a result of one or more Discriminatory
Actions in the relevant fiscal years, and, if the answer is affirmative, determining
the [...] Damages [...].

(b) In the event that it is agreed or determined that one or more
Discriminatory Actions resulting in a Material Adverse Effect have occurred and
that the [Claimants] [are] thus an Affected Party, in a second stage of the same
proceedings the arbitral panel shall determine the “Buy-Out Price” [...]. During
the second stage of the arbitration proceedings, the Parties shall continue (or
commence) negotiations regarding the Amendments.”””

525. Article 14.4(c) defines what the “By-Out Price” shall be depending upon the stage of
development of the Hamaca Project. In the instant case, the Parties agree that the
definition of “Buy-Out Price” in Article 14.4(c)(B)’”* is applicable, which states in

relevant part that:

 

they agree that a DA resulting in MAE has occurred. “If [Corpoguanipa] and the [Claimants] agree that a
Discriminatory Action resulting in a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and that the [Claimants are] thus an
Affected Party, the Parties shall enter into good faith negotiations regarding the Amendments; provided that the
Amendments shall not result in a cost to Corpoven Sub exceeding the Damages actually suffered by the
[Claimants]...”).

Flow that the Affected Party would have attained in the relevant Fiscal Years has the Discriminatory Action not
occurred, plus interest thereon at LIBOR from the date Damages are incurred until the date the Damages are
determined in accordance with Section 14.4(a). The calculation of such amount shall be increased to take into

a DA. The Tribunal will address that issue, if necessary, once it has concluded whether the Counterclaim stands
or falls.

[...] the Buy-Out Price shall be equal to the commercial value (without taking
into account the effect of the Discriminatory Actions but taking into account the
provisions of this Article XIV in respect of the Threshold Cash Flow) of the

526. The term “Project Interest” is defined as follows:

“Project Interest” shall mean, (i) [...] in respect of Phillips, 20%, or; (ii) with
respect to any Party, such Party’s undivided direct or indirect percentage
interest in the Association, the direct or indirect interest held by such Party in
each Association Entity (as defined in Section 4.10), and all rights, title,
interests and obligations ing thereto, including, without limitation, the
Party's rights under this Agreement and all rights and interests in the Initial
Upgrader, the Second Upgrader and all other assets jointly owned by two or
more of the Parties and all contracts and leases jointly entered into by or on
behalf of the Parties in connection with the Project activities, in each case as
the same may vary from time to time.78°

 

527. Article 14.4(b) finally stipulates that “the Parties shall continue (or commence)
negotiations regarding the Amendments”’*' even during the second phase of the
arbitration.

528. Article 14.5 then addresses the consequences of the Parties not reaching an
agreement regarding potential amendments to the Hamaca AA and the arbitral panel
delivering its decision on the “Buy-Out Price” in the meantime, providing in relevant
part as follows:

(a) In the event that the Parties have not previously agreed on the
Amendments, upon receipt of an arbitral award relating to the Buy-Out Price,
the [Claimants], within thirty (30) days, shall notify [Corpoguanipa] of whether it
elects to withdraw or maintain its claim for compensation. If [it] does not
withdraw its claim, [Corpoguanipa], within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
Affected Party's notice, shall either.

(1) pay the Affected Party’s Damages [...] for the relevant Fiscal Years
out of [Corpoguanipa]’s net cash flow from the Project (with interest
accruing on any amount of Damages determined to be owing, but not
paid, in any year at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2%); provided that in the
event any Affected Party accumulates unpaid Damages in excess of the
Affected Party's Project Interest of $75,000,000, or in the event that
such Affected Party has accrued Damages outstanding for a period in
excess of three hundred and sixty-five (365) days, all accrued but
unpaid Damages of such Affected Party shall be promptly paid by
[Corpoguanipa] or PDVSA in its capacity as guarantor, in each case out
of their general corporate funds or otherwise; or

(3) have the Parties continue to negotiate the Amendments, in which event,
if the Parties have not agreed upon the necessary Amendments within

Out Price, on the terms set forth in (1) or (2) above, as applicable.”82
Article 14.5(b) to (d) addresses aspects of interest payment, tax benefits and the
implications of the Respondents’ participation in the Hamaca Project reducing below
25%. As such, the Tribunal does not consider them germane to the discussion on the

legality of exercising the Buy-Out Option.
Analysis

In light of the Parties’ arguments the crux of the dispute is whether the Buy-Out
Provisions are compatible with and can be invoked in case of an Expropriation.

At first blush, the Tribunal notes that the definition of DA in the Hamaca AA7® — which
expressly includes expropriation — and the text of the Buy-Out Provisions read
together, appear to suggest that the Buy-Out Option can be invoked in case of
Expropriation. However, the Tribunal finds merit in the Claimants’ argument that
reading the Buy-Out Provisions in this manner would render parts of these Provisions
dead letter or self-contradictory. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that in order to
determine the true scope of application of these Provisions they must be construed
as a whole.

In that regard, as the Claimants rightly point out, the primary (and preferred) solution
envisaged in the event a DA results in MAE, is amendments to the Hamaca AA in lieu
of the damages suffered by the Claimants. Moreover, the Buy-Out Provisions
repeatedly envisage opportunities for the Parties to agree on such amendments. In
particular:

o Article 14.3(c) provides that if the Claimants consider that they have suffered MAE
pursuant to the DA and the Respondents agree with such characterization, the
Parties are required to enter into good faith negotiations with the objective of

reaching an agreement on the amendments that can be made to the Hamaca
AA;784

o Article 14.4(b) provides that the Parties can continue their negotiations or even
commence fresh negotiations regarding the Amendments, regardless of having
commenced arbitration to determine the Buy-Out Price;

o Article 14.5(a) restricts payment of damages or the Buy-Out Option to cases

where the Parties have not previously agreed on Amendments; and

o Article 14.5(a)(3) provides that even after the Buy-Out Price has been determined
and the Claimants have decided not to withdraw their claim for compensation, the
Parties may make one last attempt to negotiate amendments to the Hamaca
AA. 785

In the Tribunal’s opinion, it stands to reason that the foremost objective of the above
provisions was to keep the Hamaca AA and the Parties’ relationship alive to the
extent possible, or as the Claimants eloquently describe:
while the Contracting Parties [were] negotiating a revision to their ongoing
Association Agreement to compensate for the effect of a Discriminatory Action
and save their commercial marriage, if they can, a Buy-Out Price [was to be]
identified that could lead to a future amicable divorce.76°
In the circumstances, it is inconceivable that the Buy-Out Option could also be
applicable in a situation where the Claimants had been dispossessed of the Hamaca
Project and the Hamaca AA terminated, leaving no contractual relationship to salvage
through suitable amendments.”*” Given the tenor of the above requirements, the
Tribunal finds that there is a significant chink in the Respondents’ counterclaim.

The Tribunal notes that the Respondents give some importance to the fact that two of
the Claimants’ witnesses, Mr. Manning and Mr. Heinrich, appeared to accept that the
Buy-Out Option could be triggered by any DA during the Hearing.’”®° However, the

784 As argued elsewhere, the Claimants are required to inform the Respondents that they consider themselves to
have been affected by a DA resulting in MAE by issuing a Notice of Triggering Event (Supra, §§ 238-240). It is if
the Respondents’ agree to such characterization that the obligation to enter into good faith negotiations regarding
amendments to the Hamaca AA kicks in. However, in the instant case, the objective of issuing such a Notice was
rendered nugatory by virtue of the fact that the Hamaca AA had been terminated and no “amendments” to the
same could be negotiated.

Tribunal is far from convinced by the spin that the Respondents seek to put on their
testimony. Mr. Manning expressed his hesitation to apply the Buy-Out Provisions in
an expropriation scenario’®® and in response to questions from the Tribunal, Mr.
Heinrich clarified that he only referred to the Hamaca AA in his capacity and to the
extent necessary as a member of the Board of Directors of the Hamaca JVC.7%°

536. That apart, the Respondents’ counterclaim would contradict the framework and

mechansim of the Buy-Out Option, as more particularly discussed below.

537. Article 14.5(a) contemplates that once the Claimants have decided not to withdraw
their claim for compensation, the Respondents can do one of two things: either “pay
the Affected Party's [i.e. the Claimants] damages”; or, “purchase the Affected Party's
[i.e. the Claimants] Project Interest at the Buy-Out Price”. It is clear from the use of
“either [...] or” in this provision that these two options must be exercised in the
alternative and not in conjunction. That is to say, the Respondents may only exercise
the right to buy-out or purchase the Claimants’ Project Interest, if they have elected to
not pay compensation for losses caused due to a DA. Either the Respondents can
compensate the Claimants for the losses sufferred (i.e. a one way transaction from
the Respondents to the Claimants) or, the Respondents can retain the damages and
instead purchase the Claimants’ Project Interests at the Buy-Out Price (i.e. a two way
transaction involving an “exchange of property”).

538. The Respondents seek to conflate both of these options in their Counterclaim. Their
claim is that they are “entitled to acquire [the Claimants’ claim for compensation] at
the buy-out price.”’°' In support of this argument, they rely on the allegedly broad
definition of “Project Interests” in the Hamaca AA, which covers “all rights, titles,

interests, and obligations associated with” the Claimants percentage interests in the

Hamaca JVC.’ The Tribunal sees two related problems with this argument. First, as
the Claimants rightly assert, to accept such a reading would bely the very notion of
“acquisition” or “exchange of property” that is inherent in a “purchase”.’> Second,
going by their present argument, the Respondents appear to be exercising the option
to pay as well as to purchase. Rather, they appear to be “purchasing” the very same
“compensation” that they are electing not to pay. Thus, the Tribunal is unable to
agree with the Respondents’ reading of and reliance on the definition of “Project
Interests” to support its argument.

In fact, the Respondents’ argument is contradicted by the HCA — a document to
which they have attached great importance. The Twenty First Condition of the
Hamaca Congressional Authorization provides that:

The Association Agreement will include provisions that allow for the
compensation of the Participants, through amendments to the provisions of the
Association Agreement or through the payment of damages, in the event that
the Net Cash Flow of a Participant of the Association's activities is substantially
and adversely affected as a direct, necessary and demonstrable consequence
of discriminatory and unjust measures, without prejudice to the option for
Corpoven, according to the provisions of the Association Agreement, to
purchase such participation of the Affected Party on equitable conditions, if the
effect of such amendments or the payment of such damages results in a
change of conditions unacceptable for Corpoven. It is understood that the
Affected Party must have exhausted all remedies conferred upon it by the laws
to obtain the revocation of the discriminatory measures. In no case will it be
understood that the application of these mechanisms limits, affects or restricts
in any way the power of the governmental bodies (“Organos del Poder Puiblico”)
to adopt measures pursuant to the Constitution and applicable Laws.”

The Tribunal notes that this provision first and foremost confirms that the method of
compensating the Claimants for a DA resulting in MAE is either through amendments
to the provisions of the Association Agreement or through the payment of damages.
Second, this provision clearly requires the Respondents to exercise their much
emphasized “without prejudice” Buy-Out Option “according to the provisions of the
Association Agreement.” This in itself is sufficient for the Tribunal to conclude that the
Hamaca AA prevails over anything that the HCA may stipulate, at least insofar as the
Buy-Out Provisions are concerned. In any event, as concluded elsewhere, in case of
inconsistencies between the Hamaca AA and the HCA, the former will control.795

543.

In the alternative, even if the HCA were applied, it does not alter the Tribunal’s
conclusions. The Twenty First Condition stipulates that the Respondents can
purchase the “participation” of the Claimants in the event they find the payment of
damages or the amendments unacceptable. A reading of other conditions of the
Hamaca Congressional Authorization clearly demonstrates that participation is
understood in the same sense as “shareholding” and not “damages payable due to
Expropriation” as any right or interest attached to such shareholding. For instance,
the Second Condition stipulates that “For the purposes of complying with tax
obligations and other general responsibilities, each of the parties will be
independently responsible, according to its share of participation in the Association,
since the Association is formed without legal personality.””°° The Third Condition
stipulates that “[t]he Association Agreement shall specify the initial share of
participation of each Party in the Association, establishing that ARCO and Corpoven
shall each have an initial interest of 30%, and that Phillips and Texaco shall each
have an initial interest of 20% in the Association.””%” Thus, if the Tribunal were to
interpret “Project Interest” in light of the above conditions, the meaning of “Project
Interest” has to be limited. The Respondents’ attempt to “purchase” the Claimants’

“claim for compensation” and consequently this Counterclaim is still bound to fail.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal is of the view that a harmonious reading of the
Buy-Out Provisions must necessarily lead to the conclusion that they are incompatible
with a situation where the Hamaca Project has been completely expropriated.
Accordingly, the Respondents’ Counterclaim is dismissed.

QUANTUM

The positions and arguments of each Party, insofar as they are necessary to resolve
the relevant quantum issues in dispute, have been reproduced prior to the Tribunal’s
analysis of each issue. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal emphasizes that it has not
provided a summary of each and every specific objection and argument raised by the
Parties in their quantum submissions, as it would be both repetitive and unnecessary.
Thus the Tribunal has reproduced only what it views as the most important arguments

796 Hamaca Congressional Authorization, C-59, Second Condition (emphasis added).

797 Hamaca Congressional Authorization, C-59, Third Condition (emphasis added). See also Fourth Condition
(‘The Parties may participate in Phase Ill according to the proportion of their interest in the Association at the time
the decision to participate in Phase III is made and shall have the privileged right to acquire the interest not taken
by other Parties in said proportion.”), Eighth Condition (“The initial participation by the Parties (and the inclusion
of any third party) in the Association, including but not limited to, the participation of the Parties in Phase III, can
be modified pursuant to the provisions set forth in the Association Agreement, subject to what was established in
the Third Condition. Under no circumstances shall the said modifications affect Corpoven’s control rights that are
hereby established.”).

for its decision. That being said, even if not expressly reproduced, the Tribunal has
considered and carefully examined all of the Parties’ arguments and corresponding
facts.

544. The Tribunal notes that, since the very outset, the Claimants have argued that,
“[u]nder the AAs, the Guarantees, and Venezuelan law, [the] Respondents are jointly
and severally liable to [...] indemnify [the] Claimants pursuant to the DA Claim”.’°
As pointed out by the Claimants, the Tribunal further notes that the “Respondents
also appear not to contest that they are jointly and severally liable to pay damages
for the Willful Breach Claim, and to indemnify Claimants pursuant to the DA Claim”.7°°
Given the Respondents’ silence, the Tribunal has no reason to depart from the
Claimants’ submission. In this regard, as set out in infra Section VI, the Tribunal’s
findings must be deemed as holding the Respondents jointly and severally liable to
indemnify the Claimants under the DA provisions of each AA.

A. PRELIMINARY MATTERS
1. The DA formulae
a. The Petrozuata AA

545. Sections 9.07(a) to (c) of the Petrozuata AA set out the formula for the payment of
compensation by the Respondents following the issuance of a “discriminatory” and
“unjust” qualified measure affecting the Claimants (i.e. a measure that can be
characterized as a DA).®°° These provisions state as follows:

(a) Subject to paragraph (d) below, the Injured Shareholder shall be
compensated from cash available to the Company for the payment of dividends
to the Class A Privileged Shareholder and the repayment of Cash Call Loans
(both principal and interest) to the Class A Privileged Shareholder, starting with
the next declaration of dividends or Cash Call Loan repayment installment, until
full compensation has been made of the amounts calculated in accordance with
subparagraph (b) below. The Company will be deemed to have paid the
dividend or Cash Call Loan (both principal and interest) repayment, as the case
may be, to the Class A Privileged Shareholder which corresponds to any
compensation made hereunder. Any compensation payment due which cannot
be paid because the Company has insufficient cash in any given Fiscal Year
from which to declare dividends or make payments on cash call Loans (both
principal and interest) shall be deferred and accumulated until the next fiscal
year(s) until finally paid, unless the accumulated amount reaches US $ 200
million (Two Hundred Million Dollars) in which case the Class A Privileged
Shareholder shall, out of its own general funds, pay this accumulated amount to

the Injured Shareholder. Any accumulated amount existing at the Termination
Date shall be paid by the Class A Shareholder out of its own general funds. The
Class A Privileged Shareholder may remedy the damage or settle the obligation
through alternative means if the terms and conditions of such alternative
remedy are acceptable to the Injured Shareholder.

(b) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (c) below, the amount to be
compensated shall be calculated by determining the Price of Brent Crude Oil
deflated annually to the year 1994 by the US Inflation Index for each applicable
year. If the result yields a price of Brent crude oil of $18.00 per barrel or less,
100% of the damages suffered by an Injured Shareholder shall be
compensated, including the threshold amount for purposes of calculating
Significant Economic Damage. If the result yields a price of Brent crude oil of
$25.00 per barrel or more, then 0% of the damages suffered by an Injured
Shareholder shall be compensated. If the result yields a price of Brent crude oil
of between $18.00 and $25.00 per barrel, the percentage of damages to be
compensated shall be determined by the following formula:

100% less [100% times (Price of Brent Blend Crude Oil less $18.00) divided by

$7.00)]

as illustrated by the graph attached hereto and made a part hereof as
Exhibit "S".

(c) In the event that in any given Fiscal Year the economic damage

suffered by virtue of Discriminatory Actions is greater than $75 million (in 1994
Dollars inflated by the US Inflation Index) the amount to be compensated for
that Fiscal Year shall be the greater of 25% of the actual economic damage or
the amount resulting from the calculation according to subparagraph (b)
above.®1

227

547. On the basis of Sections 9.07(a) to (c) and Exhibit S, the Parties and their quantum
experts essentially agree that the DA compensation mechanism in the Petrozuata AA

operates as follows:8°3

Qualified measures must have caused the Claimants economic harm in any
given fiscal year greater than USD 6.5 million in Yr. 1994 USD®% (i.e. SED). If
not, then no compensation is owed by the Respondents. As established
elsewhere,®°> the harm suffered by the Claimants as a result of the Income
Tax Increase and the Expropriation has crossed the aforementioned de
minimis threshold.

If the economic harm for a given fiscal year is between the minimum of USD
6.5 million and USD 75 million in Yr. 1994 USD, then compensation is set
pursuant to a sliding scale determined by a range of average Brent crude oil
(‘Brent’) prices.°° Accordingly, the indemnity by the Respondents will be 0%
of the damages suffered by the Claimants (or nil indemnity) when the average
Brent price for the given fiscal year (deflated to Yr. 1994 USD) is greater than
or equal to USD 25 per barrel. In turn, the indemnity by the Respondents will
be 100% of the damages suffered by the Claimants when the average Brent
price for the given fiscal year (again deflated to Yr. 1994 USD) is less than or
equal to USD 18 per barrel. In between these Brent prices (i.e. USD 18 and
USD 25 per barrel), the percentage of the Respondents’ indemnity obligation
will decrease by approximately 14% for every USD 1 increase in the Brent

price.

If the economic harm suffered by the Claimants for a given fiscal year is
greater than USD 75 million in Yr. 1994 USD, then the compensation
obligation by the Respondents is equal to the greater of: (i) 25% of the
economic damages suffered by the Claimants; or (ii) the amount determined
in accordance with the Brent price sliding scale.

. If the harm is greater than USD 75 million in Yr. 1994 USD, and for the

relevant time period the Brent price has been greater than USD 25 per barrel
in yr. 1994 USD, then establishing the Respondents’ indemnity obligation

803 C-PHB, § 985; R-PHB, §§ 142-144; Abdala ER I, CER-3, § 55; Brailovsky & Flores ER I, RER-3, §§ 86-87.

does not require the use of the Brent price sliding formula: compensation to
the Claimants is set at 25% of the harm suffered by the Claimants as a result

of the discriminatory qualified measures at issue.

In light of the above, it is common ground that, since the adoption of the Income Tax
Increase and the Expropriation in 2007, the annual average Brent price has always
been greater than USD 25 per barrel in Yr. 1994 USD.®” The Parties’ quantum
experts further agree that the same can be expected and therefore safely projected
for the remainder of the original term of the Petrozuata AA, i.e., until 2036.8°°

It follows that the Respondents’ indemnity obligation under the Petrozuata AA for the
harm caused by the Income Tax Increase and the Expropriation is equivalent to
either: (i) 25% of the corresponding harm as long as the said harm for any given year
exceeds USD 75 million in Yr. 1994 USD; or (ii) 0% of the corresponding harm if said
harm for any given year fails to exceed USD 75 million in Yr. 1994 USD.®°°

The Claimants’ quantum expert, Mr. Abdala, alleges that because the Petrozuata AA
does not provide for a complete and specific formula to determine the Claimant's
yearly harm (as does the Hamaca AA),°"° it is more appropriate to adopt a “standard
economic approach” computing the Project's “Revenues”, “Costs”, “Taxes”, “Change
in Working Capital”, and “Debt Payments”.8"7

To some extent, a similar approach is taken by the Respondents’ quantum experts.
Indeed, Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores do not openly contest either Mr. Abdala’s
assertion that the Petrozuata AA lacks a clear formula for the calculation of the
Claimants’ yearly harm, or the actual formula proposed by Mr. Abdala. Rather, in
order to carry out the DA provisions of the Petrozuata AA, Mr. Brailovsky and Mr.
Flores essentially consider the same inputs as Mr. Abdala: they also account for, inter
alia, the Project's production volumes and sales (i.e. revenue),®'? the Projects’
costs,®"3 the applicable fiscal regime,°"* working capital,‘ and debt services.°'° The

main difference between the Parties’ experts thus lies in the methodology adopted to
arrive at the actual values of these inputs.

552. The Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the Petrozuata AA lacks a contractually
defined exact formula to establish the harm against which the Claimants can claim
compensation under the DA provisions. The Tribunal nevertheless has noted the
Parties’ implicit agreement as to the general mechanics and quantum inputs to that
effect.

b. The Hamaca AA

553. Articles 14.2(a) and 14.2(b) to (i) of the Hamaca AA set out the formula for the
computation of damages payable to the Claimants by the Respondents in the event
of harm caused by DAs.®1” In their relevant part, they provide as follows:

(a) Corpoven Sub shall be required to compensate any Foreign Party, in
the manner described in this Article XIV, to the extent that the Party suffers a
reduction of more than five percent (5%) in any Fiscal Year in its
Reference Net Cash Flow as the result of one or more Discriminatory
Actions (including Discriminatory Actions occurring after, but having an effect
on the Reference Net Cash Flow from, such year) (any such Party, an "Affected
Party"), with such reduction being determined by comparing, with respect
to any Party in any Fiscal Year, such Party's Reference Net Cash Flow for
such year, including the effect of all uncompensated Discriminatory
Actions, with the Party's Reference Net Cash Flow for such year
excluding the effect of the uncompensated Discriminatory Actions (such
reduction, a "Material Adverse Effect"), it being understood that any
Discriminatory Actions would be considered unjust if they resulted, individually
or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The obligation described in (a) shall be modified following the first
period (the "Initial Period") of three (3) consecutive Fiscal Years after the
Date of First Commercial Shipment in which:

(i) the Affected Party's average Reference Net Cash Flow is equal
to or greater than the average Threshold Cash Flow (as defined
in Section 14.2(g)); and

(ii) the Price of Brent Crude Oil (as defined below), averaged over
such three-year period, is equal to or greater than $27.00.

For the purposes of this Section, the "Price of Brent Crude Oil" shall mean the
average, over a specified period of time, of the daily high and low quotes per
barrel for dated Brent, FOB Sullom Voe, published in Platt's Oilgram Price
Report (International Spot Crude Price Assessments for Brent (DTD)) published
daily by the Commodities Division of Standard & Poor's, deflated to average
1996 Dollars using the US Inflation Index (as defined below); provided that in
the event that Brent Crude Oil shall cease to be representative of world crude
oil prices or Platt's Oilgram Price Report ceases to be published, the Parties

 

816 Brailovsky & Flores ER I, RER-3, p. 103.
817 Supra, § 108.

230

shall unanimously agree on a substitute marker crude oil or reference
publication and amend this definition accordingly. For the purposes of the
definition of Brent Crude Oil, the "US Inflation Index" shall mean the annual
percentage increase or decrease, if any, in the "Implicit Price Deflators for
Gross Domestic Product" as published by the United States Department of
Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (or a substitute source unanimously
agreed by the Parties if such index shall cease to be published).

(c) In the years immediately following the Initial Period, Corpoven Sub's
compensation obligation shall be as follows:

(i) In any Fiscal Year in which a Party suffers a Material Adverse
Effect as the result of one or more Discriminatory Actions, the
Parties shall determine whether the Affected Party's Reference
Net Cash Flow for that Fiscal Year averaged with the two (2)
immediately preceding Fiscal Years was equal to or greater
than the Affected Party's Threshold Cash Flow for that Fiscal
Year averaged with such Party's Threshold Cash Flow for the
two (2) immediately preceding fiscal years. -

(ii) If the answer to (i) above is negative, Corpoven Sub shall be
required to compensate the Affected Party in accordance with
Sections 14.2(d) and (e).

(iii) If the answer to (i) above is affirmative, Corpoven Sub shall not
be required to compensate the Affected Party for any Material
Adverse Effect suffered by the Affected Party as a result of any
one or more Discriminatory Actions that were generally
applicable to extra heavy crude oil projects subject to taxation
under paragraph unique of Article 9 of the Income Tax Law
(such actions "Generally Applicable Discriminatory Actions").
Corpoven Sub's relief from the obligation to compensate shall
terminate at the end of the first Fiscal Year during which the
Affected Party's Reference Net Cash Flow for that Fiscal Year
averaged with the two (2) immediately preceding Fiscal Years is
less than the Affected Party's Threshold Cash Flow for that year
averaged with the Affected Party's Threshold Cash Flow for two
(2) immediately preceding Fiscal Years.

(d) In all Fiscal Years after the termination of relief from compensation
described in (c)(iii), Corpoven Sub shall not be obligated to compensate the
Affected Party for any Material Adverse Effect suffered by it in such Fiscal
Years, to the extent that:

(i) the Material Adverse Effect is attributable to the application of
one or more Generally Applicable Discriminatory Actions;

(ii) the Affected Party's Reference Net Cash Flow is equal to or
greater than the Affected Party's Threshold Cash Flow; and

(iii) the Price of Brent Crude Oil is equal to or greater than $27.00.

(e) In all years following the Initial Period, in any Fiscal Year when the Price
of Brent Crude Oil averages $27.00 or more, any compensation payable by
Corpoven Sub to any Affected Party shall be limited to the lesser of: (a) the
Affected Party's Damages or (b) the difference between the Affected Party's
Reference Net Cash Flow and the Affected Party's Threshold Cash Flow.

(f) For the purposes hereof, the "Reference Net Cash Flow" of a Party in
respect of any Fiscal Year shall equal:

231

[(SR - DP - EX - ROY - OT) x (1 -ITR)] - SC + DP

Where: SR = (the Party's Project Interest of Commercial
Production or Development Production as
applicable, multiplied by the applicable Reference Price)
plus any compensation received from Corpoven Sub in
respect of prior Discriminatory Actions

DP = depreciation calculated on the basis of a 10-year
depreciation schedule or, if different, the schedule
required by law

EX = the Party's pro rata share of actual expenses of
the Association

ROY = the actual royalty rate applicable to the Party's
Project Interest of Extra Heavy Oil multiplied by the
royalty base

OT= actual Venezuelan taxes paid that are deductible
for income tax purposes

ITR = the actual Venezuelan income tax rate applicable
to the Party in connection with the Association's
activities; and

SC = Venezuelan taxes paid that are not deductible for
income tax purposes.

(g) For purposes hereof, "Threshold Cash Flow" shall be calculated in the
same manner as Reference Net Cash Flow, except that for the purpose of
determining Threshold Cash Flow: (i) SR will be calculated by replacing the
Reference Price with the Adjusted Price [...]. For the purposes hereof,
“Adjusted Price" shall mean that price for Commercial Production determined
in accordance with a formula established by the Board from time to time
pursuant to Section 4.8(a)(xxvii) that reflects the market price for Commercial
Production which would exist if the Price for Brent Crude Oil were $27.00,
taking into account the quality differential between Commercial Production and
Brent crude. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board has not established the
formula for determining the Adjusted Price on the date that is ninety (90) days
prior to the anticipated start-up date of the Initial Upgrader, as set forth in the
Phase II Business Plan, or at any time thereafter within ninety (90) days of the
request of any Party, any Party may request that such formula be determined
by an expert who is a reputable individual possessing expert knowledge and
experience with respect to the pricing of crude oil. All calculations will be based
on FOB prices for each crude at the point of origin.

(h) For the purposes hereof, the "Reference Price" shall mean (x) for
Commercial Production, the Formula Price or, if applicable, the Bid Price for
such Commercial Production or (y) for Development Production, the price
calculated for such Development Production at the wellhead, based on the
value received for blended crude less the cost of diluent oil and all other costs,
as provided in the Authorization and Accounting Policies.

(i) Calculations of Reference Net Cash Flow and Threshold Cash Flow
shall be made in Dollars to the exclusion of any other currency.818

554. According to the Claimants, the “cornerstone of the indemnification calculation” under
the Hamaca AA is the Reference Net Cash Flow (“RNCF”) as defined in Article
14.2(f).5"9 This is so, the Claimants submit, given that the RNCF is used in deciding
whether the MAE “threshold” has been met, and then in determining the amount
owed by the Respondents.®?? The Claimants therefore argue that the DA
compensation provisions of the Hamaca AA respond to the following two-step inquiry:

Step 1: has the Material Adverse Effect threshold been met? Like the
Petrozuata AA, the Hamaca AA requires that the Discriminatory Action or
Actions have a minimum economic impact before Respondent Corpoguanipa
(and Respondent PDVSA under the Guarantee) are required to indemnify.
Rather than the monetary amount used in the Petrozuata AA, however, the
threshold under the Hamaca AA is defined as a percentage reduction in the
Reference NCF. Specifically, a Discriminatory Action will have caused a
Material Adverse Effect if there is a five percent or greater difference between:
(i) cash flows to Claimant CPH in the but-for scenario, assuming no
Discriminatory Measures; and (ii) actual cash flows to Claimant CPH (as
reduced by the Measures). [...]

 

Step 2: determining the amount of indemnification. The second step of the
Hamaca indemnification analysis is to:

(a) calculate the Reference NCF without the effect of the
Discriminatory Action or Actions (i.e., the but-for scenario) for
each year from 2007 through the expiration of the Hamaca AA
in 2037;

(b) subtract the actual cash flows received by Claimant CPH in
each of those years; and

(c) determine the present value of the lost cash flows by updating
past losses and discounting future losses.

However, for purposes of calculating item (i) above, the DA provisions in the
Hamaca AA limit oil prices to US$27 per barrel (in 1996 dollars), for purposes of
determining the but-for revenues that would have been obtained (the variable
“SR” in the Reference NCF formula set out above). Because Brent prices have
exceeded US$27 per barrel since 2008 (and are expected to do so in future),
this results in a substantial reduction in damages over the life of the Hamaca
AA, compared to actual losses.®"

555. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the RNCF is of fundamental importance
for the Respondents’ indemnity obligations under the Hamaca AA. Indeed, the RNCF
is required to determine the existence of MAE. In turn, it is undisputed that the
Claimants must demonstrate the existence of MAE in order to be entitled to
compensation under the Hamaca AA. Accordingly, “Step 1” of the Claimants’

proposed inquiry corresponds to the text of the Hamaca DA provisions. In this regard,

819 C-PHB, § 991.
820 C-PHB, § 991.
821 C-PHB, §§ 994-995.

233

the Tribunal recalls that, as established elsewhere,®22 the Income Tax Increase and
the Expropriation have indeed caused MAE to the Claimants.

556. That being said, the Tribunal shares the Respondents’ indication that “Step 2” of the
Claimants’ suggested inquiry is incomplete: while the RNCF is an essential
benchmark in order to carry out the Respondents’ indemnity obligation, it is alone
insufficient after the expiration of what Article 14.2(b) of the Hamaca AA denominates
as the Initial Period (i.e. the three consecutive fiscal years after the date of first
commercial shipment).8?3 Subsequent to the Initial Period, Articles 14.2 (c) to (e)
become controlling and a second benchmark must be taken into account in addition
to the RNCF,°% namely, the Threshold Cash Flow (“TCF”) as defined in Article
14.2(g).825

557. The TCF is calculated in the same way as the RNCF,®”¢ albeit with the following input
adjustment:

(i) SR will be calculated by replacing the Reference Price with the Adjusted
Price [...]. For the purposes hereof, "Adjusted Price" shall mean that price for
Commercial Production determined in accordance with a formula established
by the Board from time to time pursuant to Section 4.8(a)(xxvii) that reflects
the market price for Commercial Production which would exist if the Price
for Brent Crude Oil were $27.00, taking into account the quality differential
between Commercial Production and Brent crude. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Board has not established the formula for determining the
Adjusted Price [...] any Party may request that such formula be determined by
an expert [...].827

 

558. In this context, the Tribunal notes that the Parties’ quantum experts agree that the
first commercial shipment took place in October 2004.88 Hence, the Initial Period
elapsed at the end of 2007.®9 As such, harm exceeding the minimum MAE will not be
compensated if the average RNCF for any given year and the two prior years is
greater than the average TCF for the same three-year period.®°° If the average RNCF

is lower than the average TCF, however, “then compensation to the Claimants is
calculated as the lesser of: (i) the actual damages suffered; and (ii) the difference
between the [TCF] and the [RNCF]”.®*"

559. It is thus clear to the Tribunal that, contrary to the Claimants’ position,®°? the
calculation of the RNCF is not limited to prices for Brent at USD 27 per barrel. Rather,
it is the Adjusted Price pertaining to the TCF which is to be calculated proportionally
to the said fixed Brent price. The fact that the RNCF and the TCF share almost the
same quantum inputs to establish the Respondents’ compensation obligations does
not mean that both cash flows are indistinguishable.®°> The RNCF must first be used
in order to identify the MAE suffered by the Claimants as a result of DAs. After the
Initial Period, which is the case at hand, the identified harm must then be contrasted
with the TCF in order to calculate the indemnity owed to the Claimants.®*

560. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is undisputed that, since the Expropriation, the
Claimants’ RNCF is nil.8%5 This translates into a reduction in the Claimants’ cash flow
of a 100%.®°6 Further, as already mentioned above, Brent has been trading upwards
of USD 27 per barrel since 2007 and is expected to continue doing so.®7 It follows
that the actual harm suffered by the Claimants due to the Income Tax Increase and
the Expropriation has most certainly exceeded the average TCF for the relevant
period (in accordance with Articles 14.2(c)(i)-(ii) of the Hamaca AA). Therefore,

®31 Brailovsky & Flores ER |, RER-3, § 99; Hamaca AA, C-3, Article 14.2(e).
832 Supra, § 554.

833 The Tribunal notes that, in addition to the calculation of the “SR” input based on the Adjusted Price (as
opposed to the Reference Price), the TCF also differs with respect to the RNCF on a few other inputs. To wit, the
“DP” (depreciation), “EX” (expenses), “ROY” (royalty rate), “OT” (taxes deductible for income tax purposes), “ITR”
(income tax) and “SC” (taxes not deductible for income tax purposes) inputs set out at Article 14.2(g) of the
Hamaca AA. However, there appears to be a common understanding as to how the driving distinction between
the RNCF and the TCF is the latter’s calculation of the “SR” input pursuant to the Adjusted Price. Indeed, during
the Hearing, the Claimants’ quantum expert, Mr. Abdala, accepted that the TCF is calculated by taking the RNCF’
inputs and “basically” replacing the RNCF’s Reference Price with the TCF’s Adjusted Price (Tr. (Day 10), 2691:4-
10). The Respondents’ quantum expert, Mr. Flores, expressed the same view (Tr. (Day 10), 2749:25 — 2750:4).

RNCF/TCF formula are not in dispute.

Net Cash Flow became equal to zero after the nationalization [...]").

836 Abdala ER |, CER-3, § 48. It is noteworthy to recall that MAE is caused by only a 5% reduction of the
Claimants’ RNCF as a result of a discriminatory qualified measure.

pursuant to Article 14.2(e) of the Hamaca AA, the compensation owed to the
Claimants as a result of the DAs at issue is “simply equal to the [TCF]”.®°

In light of the above, the Tribunal notes that the Parties ultimately adopt the same
approach in terms of how to implement the DA provisions in the Hamaca AA: the “SR”
input in the RNCF must reflect a Brent price benchmark fixed at USD 27 per barrel
(i.e. the “SR” as defined in the TCF).®° Further, in determining the Respondents’
indemnity obligation pursuant to the Hamaca DA provisions, the calculations of Mr.
Abdala, Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores all account for, inter alia, the Claimants’
revenues, costs and corresponding fiscal regime.®° Therefore, despite the Parties’
differences with respect to each individual quantum input, which will be discussed in
detail below,®" the Parties appear to agree on the mechanics and methodology of the
Hamaca DA provisions.

In sum, as pointed out by the Claimants, the overall exercise required to calculate the
compensation owed by the Respondents under the Hamaca AA (and, indeed, also
under the Petrozuata AA) entails “determ[ining] the present value of lost past and
future cash flows [...]”.842

Ex post v. ex ante quantum assessment

It is common ground between the Parties and their experts that, subject to the limits
set forth in the DA provisions, Venezuelan law requires compensation in accordance
with the full reparation (restitution in integrum) principle. In this context, since the
very outset both Parties have argued in favor of an ex post date-of-award valuation
as the most appropriate standard for the calculation of damages under Venezuelan

law.844

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties dispute the inter-temporal principle
applicable to the historical data of the said ex post valuation. In other words, while the
Parties do not disagree on the key inputs necessary to determine the compensation

owed under the DA provisions (i.e. the Projects’ production volumes, oil prices, costs,
and applicable fiscal regime),®4° they are not in agreement when it comes to
determining the relevant historical data comprising the same key inputs.

The Claimants submit that “the Tribunal’s award of damages must return Claimants to
the position they would have enjoyed if Respondents’ wrongful acts had not occurred.
This is referred to as the ‘but-for’ scenario. In that scenario, Claimants would have
maintained their ownership interests (and management role) in the Projects, and
would have continued to receive cash flows (dividends) from the Projects’ operations
through the end of their contractual terms”.®° In this regard, the Claimants contend
that both the “agreed pre-expropropriation production profiles” and the “agreed cost
projections in the pre-expropriation business planning documents” constitute the best
evidence of what the Projects could have reasonably be expected to achieve applying
the but-for test.*4” According to the Claimants, international tribunals have frequently
relied on such pre-expropriation projections, and with good reason: “they reflect what
the disputing parties agreed was likely to be achieved, at a nonsuspect time prior to
the dispute arising”.*4 As such, the valuation’s historical period (i.e. the data up to the
date of valuation) must be circumscribed to the Projects’ projections (particularly on
production volumes and costs) prior to the Expropriation. Conversely, pre-
Expropriation data must be carried forward into the remainder of the historical period,
namely, from 2007 all through the date of valuation (i.e. the date of the Award).

The Respondents in turn argue that the Claimants’ alleged but-for application
impermissibly places them in a better position than they would be, had they remained
in the Projects.*° This is so because the Claimants: (i) take advantage of any post-
Expropriation development, such as capturing the benefit of the increase in oil prices;
and (ii) at the same time ignore any increase in the Projects’ actual costs and their
decline in production by defaulting into pre-Expropriation projections (i.e. as
envisaged in the 2006 ConocoPhillips Composite Economic Model and the 2006
Petrolera Ameriven Economic Model).®°°

In the Respondents’ view, the Claimants’ approach is incorrect: “it is part of the ABCs
of any ex post quantum analysis that what happens over time in a project must be
taken into consideration[;] actual experience trumps projections [...]”.°5' Thus, in order
to adequately reflect the actual development of the Projects since the Expropriation,
the data pertaining to the historical period must account for all information available at
the date of valuation, “not just the benefits of value-enhancing factors”.°° Differently
stated, a proper ex post date-of-award valuation cannot ignore the negative
development of the Projects subsequent to the Expropriation .8°

According to the Respondents, the Claimants’ reliance on pre-Expropriation
projections is only germane to ex ante date-of-breach valuations. However, “if ex ante
production and costs are to be used instead of actual figures, as Claimants suggest
with their reliance upon the 2006 ConocoPhillips Composite Economic Model and the
2006 Petrolera Ameriven Economic Model, then [an ex ante valuation] should be
applied in its entirety, without mixing and matching ex ante and ex post data”.®54 This
would require also assuming oil prices as of 2007, given that the oil price surge that
occurred thereafter was not in either Party's contemplation at that time. In
particular, the Respondents submit as follows:

Claimants insist that they can ignore any negative development that occurred in
the Projects post-nationalization, whether on the cost side or relating to
production and revenues, and calculate compensation as if the pre-
dispossession plans of over a decade ago were immutable and the Projects
were insulated from any negative developments. Their theory is that the 2006
models they rely on constitute the best evidence of what the parties hoped for
at the time and that such predispossession plans have been accepted as such
by other tribunals, including the ICC tribunal in the Mobil case. But both the ICC
Mobil and the ICSID Mobil tribunals calculated compensation on an ex ante
basis, not an ex post basis.°°°

[el

Claimants point to the Mobil |CC case as a model for calculating compensation
based on ex ante business plans and other information, but they forget that the
Mobil tribunal did that only because it was calculating compensation as of June
26, 2007. In this Arbitration, they want the Tribunal to use pre-nationalization
data, but in the context of an ex post analysis that avoids the impact of
discounting from the present to 2007, when the loss was actually incurred,
inflating compensation to astronomical heights which increase daily. In other
words, they want to mix and match facts, data and concepts to achieve a

windfall. Claimants’ compensation demand [in] applying the [DA] formula[e] is

many times what it would be if the Mobil ICC tribunal’s approach were adopted.

That result would be a scandal. As explained at the Hearing, a proper ex post

analysis would lead to much the same result as the Mobil ICC case, but if the

Tribunal were to avoid entering into the morass of the ex post analysis, the

amount determined by applying the Mobil |CC methodology should effectively

be the maximum of any rational compensation in this case.®°”
In this regard, the Respondents submit that applying the DA compensation provisions
to a full expropriation scenario is “somewhat artificial’.°° For instance, the “EX”
variable in the RNCF set out in the Hamaca AA requires the consideration of “actual
expenses”, not “but-for expenses”.®° Further, the Petrozuata AA contains provisions
contemplating the payment of compensation out of dividends from ongoing
operations, while the Hamaca AA calls for the application of the TCF formula “on a
fiscal year-by-fiscal year basis”.®©° In the circumstances, the Respondents submit that
this Tribunal can join the [CC Mobil tribunal in “appreciat[ing] the difficulties inherent
in applying the [DA] formula[e] on an ongoing basis when the [P]roject[s] no longer
exis[t] and solv[e] the dilemma by considering that the loss resulting from the
[E]xpropriation [...] was incurred in the fiscal year 2007 (i.e. adopting an ex ante date-
of-breach quantum valuation in toto).°*'

The Claimants vehemently oppose the Respondents’ proposition to undertake an ex
ante valuation. They deem it an “11'-hour reversal” raised for the first time at the
Hearing, for which there is no legitimate explanation or justification in either the
Respondents’ pre-Hearing submissions, pleadings, expert reports, or under

Venezuelan law. ®%

The Tribunal finds merit in the position of both Parties. On the one hand, the Tribunal
agrees with the Claimants that the Respondents’ suggested ex ante valuation
constitutes a “volte-face’ with respect to the approach assumed prior to the
Hearing.** Indeed, as already noted, the Respondents (along with the Claimants)

consistently argued in favor of adopting an ex post date-of-award quantum valuation

in their SoD and Rejoinder.®* It was only at the commencement of the Hearing that
the Respondents for the first time articulated the pertinence of undertaking an ex ante
valuation in the present case.® In view of this, and for the reasons explained further
below, the Tribunal finds no reason to depart from the underlying agreement existing

between the Parties up to the Hearing.

First, the voluminous quantum submissions by the Parties advocating for an ex post
valuation could hardly justify a last minute decision opting for an ex ante valuation.
Given that the case has been pleaded by both Parties based on an ex post valuation,
there is insufficient evidence for the Tribunal to confidently opt for an ex ante
approach. The Respondents refer to the Parties’ valuation models adduced in the
ICSID proceedings (which do put forward both ex ante and ex post valuations).
Nonetheless, the fact remains that the materials prepared and submitted for the
present arbitration, including those by the Respondents, have by and large dealt with
an ex post date-of-award valuation of the compensation owed pursuant to the DA
provisions.®6 Indeed, both of the Respondents’ quantum expert reports are premised

on ex post valuation.®®”

Second, the Respondents’ proposed ex ante valuation has been argued as a viable
yet not a mandatory alternative. Indeed, the Respondents do not seem to argue that
an ex post valuation is in and of itself unwarranted. Rather, the Respondents posit
that an ex ante valuation would avoid the “morass” of undertaking an ex post
valuation.®® |t follows that the convenience of favoring an ex ante valuation assumes
that the difficulties of carrying out an ex post date-of-award valuation are

insurmountable. However, they are not.

The Parties’ quantum experts are not at odds on the mechanics and arithmetic of
applying (in different ways) the disputed valuation inputs in relation to the DA
compensation provisions. To that effect, both Parties have provided ex post, date-of-
award, valuation models allowing to change and toggle the various quantum inputs in
dispute. In all valuation models, the final compensation owed to the Claimants varies
in accordance with the way each input is toggled, in favor of either the Claimants or
the Respondents. The Tribunal can therefore decide which Party should prevail on

each issue and toggle the respective input accordingly. Put simply, an ex post (as
opposed to an ex ante) valuation is feasible.

575. In any event, the Tribunal disagrees with the Respondents’ argument that applying
the DA provisions in the context of a full expropriation is artificial. As argued by the
Claimants, and “contrary to Respondents’ suggestion,® the phrase ‘actual
expenses’ in the [RNCF] formula does not alter the fact that in [a] but-for scenario, the
expenses that would have been incurred, in the absence of the Measures, must be

used”.870

576. As rightly explained by the Claimants’ quantum expert at the Hearing, this is so
because Article 14.2(a) of the Hamaca AA requires the definition of two scenarios,
“one with the effects of the [DA at issue] and one without [said] effect. In the scenario
with the effect, [one must] use the actual cash flows so as to base [the] analysis of
the [RNCF]. Of course, in the scenario without the impact of the [respective DA], [one
must] necessarily [...] create a but-for world in which the actual cash flows would no
longer be used, but rather [...] the cash flows that would have taken place if the [DA]
would not have taken place”.®”! This scenario accommodates the fact that, as pointed
out by the Respondents,®”* the Hamaca AA calls for compensation on a year-by-fiscal
year basis.

577. As to the Respondents’ argument in relation to the Petrozuata AA, it is not accurate to
claim that the DA provisions therein only provide for compensation “out of dividends
from ongoing operations”.®’3 In the right circumstances, Section 9.07(a) of the
Petrozuata AA also allows for the payment of compensation directly out of the

Respondents’ “general funds”.®”4

For the above reasons, the Tribunal cannot accept the Respondents’ proposition to
undertake an ex ante date-of-breach valuation in toto. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Tribunal agrees with the Respodents that, in principle, an ex post date of award
valuation requires considering the totality of the actual historical data preceding the
date of valuation. Indeed, the use of projections contemporaneous to a determined
date of breach is mostly apposite in the context of an ex ante date-of-breach

valuation.

That being said, the Tribunal considers that the use of both ex ante and ex post data
is not necessarily unwarranted. First, the Tribunal notes that the Respondents
themselves occasionally rely on pre-Expropriation (ex ante) calculations.”° Second, it
would be unreasonable to uphold allegedly actual post-Expropriation (ex post) data
should the Tribunal deem said data either unsubstantiated or unreliable. In those
circumstances, the Tribunal finds that reverting to ex ante projections is appropriate.
After all, as rightly pointed out by the Claimants, both the ConocoPhillips Composite
Economic Model and the Petrolera Ameriven Economic Model at some point
constituted the shared view of all Project participants, including the Respondents.®”°
Still, the decision to consider ex ante over ex post data must be assessed on a case-

by-case.

In light of these considerations, the Tribunal shall undertake an ex post date-of-award
valuation. Accordingly, as a general rule, quantum items will be assessed against
actual historical data, as opposed to pre-Expropriation projections. Nevertheless,
should the ex post data with respect to a particular quantum issue prove to be
questionable (i.e. as a result of being, inter alia, unsubstantiated or unreliable), the
Tribunal shall consider and apply ex ante projections instead.

Preferred valuation model and valuation date

In their PHB, the Respondents rely on the valuation model elaborated by Mr. Vladimir
Brailovsky and Mr. Daniel Flores for the ICSID Arbitration.®”” The Brailovsky/Flores
ICSID 2016 Valuation Model (“BFVM”) offers an ex post quantum assessment as of
31 December 2016 (as a proxy to the date of the Award).®” In turn, the Claimants

rely on the updated valuation model elaborated by Mr. Abdala and attached to their
PHB.°”9 The Abdala Updated Valuation Model (“AUVM”) also offers an ex post
calculation of the Claimants’ incurred damages, yet it does so as of 27 May 2016 (as

a proxy to the date of the Award).®°

Given BFVWM's later valuation date vis-a-vis the AUVM’'s (by 7 months), the former in

principle seems preferable in the context of an ex post date-of-award valuation: it has

a closer proximity to the actual date of the present Award. However:

The AUVM better differentiates between the various quantum aspects of the
Willful Breach Claim and those of the DA Claim. In particular, it allows
independently verifying the impact that the DA Claim has in function of the
relative success (or lack thereof) of the Willful Breach Claim.®*"

The AUVM allows toggling the disputed quantum inputs at issue in a way that
better represents the Parties’ argumentative structure on the relevant issues.
This is only natural. After all, albeit part of the record, the BFVM was prepared
and submitted for the purposes of the ICSID Arbitration. As such, it accounts
for issues not in dispute between the Parties. For instance, the BFVM
calculates damages for the Corocoro project, which is not at issue in the
present dispute.

The AUVM is consistent with pre-Hearing valuation models. Prior to the
Hearing, each Party introduced two ex post date-of-award valuation models.
The Claimants’ first valuation model for their DA Claim had a valuation date of
30 June 2015.8°2 The second one had a valuation date of 27 May 2016.®°
Correspondingly, the Respondents’ first ex post date-of-award had a valuation
date of 30 June 2015,°*4 while the second one of 27 May 2016.8 Up to the
Hearing, the Parties’ ex post valuation models were thus aligned in terms of
the date serving as proxy for the date of the Award. Notably, 27 May 2016
constituted the last common date for quantifing the indemnity owed to the

Claimants pursuant to the DA provisions of each AA. It follows that, both
before and during the Hearing, the Parties have had the opportunity of
thoroughly reviewing and commenting on the valuation of the Claimants’ DA
Claim as of 27 May 2016. In the circumstances, it seems contrary to due
process and good practice considerations to opt for a different valuation date
post-Hearing.

583. Further, the Claimants’ request for relief is made in function of damages calculations
as of 27 May 2016, namely, the same valuation date as in the AUVM.®° In other
words, AUVM's date of valuation coincides with the benchmark date pursuant to
which the Claimants claim for damages. Given the consistency between the valuation
date in the Claimants’ submissions and AUVM, the Tribunal is therefore well
positioned to assess whether the Claimants’ quantum submissions are indeed
supported by their expert evidence.

584. The Tribunal notes that, had the Claimants adopted a valuation date as of 31
December 2016 as opposed to one set at 27 May 2016, their DA Claim may have
increased.®®” However, as confirmed by their PHB, the Claimants’ prayer for relief for
their DA Claim in full amounts to USD 7.31 billion as of 27 May 2016, not 31
December 2016.® In this regard, the Tribunal is of the view that, both valuation dates
being apposite for an ex post valuation, it is within the Claimants’ prerogative to
condition and limit their request for relief as they deem it necessary.

585. In light of the above, the Tribunal considers that the AUVM constitutes the most
appropriate valuation model for the Tribunal to establish the indemnity owed to the
Claimants under the DA provisions. Accordingly, the Tribunal’s determination of the
various quantum issues in dispute shall be implemented by subsequently toggling the
different options provided in the AUVM.*®®9 It follows that, pursuant to the Claimants’

887 Mr. Abdala clarified that the DA Claim would amount to 7.91 billion if valued as of 31 December 2016 (Abdala
Hearing Presentation, 8 December 2016, slide 27). The latter figure is corroborated by the ex post valuation
model prepared by Mr. Abdala and Mr. Pablo Spiller (of Compass Lexecon and submitted to the ICSID
Arbitration), with a valuation date of 31 December 2016 (See, Abdala/Spiller ICSID Consolidated Valuation Model,
CLEX-086). Similar to the BFVM (supra, § 582.ii), the valuation model prepared by Mr. Abdala and Mr. Spiller for
the ICSID Arbitration fails to properly accommodate Parties’ position as argued in the present proceedings. In
particular, it lacks detail and is more restrictive than the AUVM. For instance, unlike the AUVM, the Abdala/Spiller
ICSID Consolidated Valuation Model does not allow the Control Panel's user to: (i) adopt custom interest and
discount rates; or (ii) independently toggle the price applicable to the Projects’ by-products.

888 C-PHB, § 1027(0).
889 This notwithstanding, the Tribunal notes that despite the already considerable detail of the AUVM’s Control
Panel, certain of the Tribunal’s determinations could not be implemented by toggling the available options.

Accordingly, as seen below, and when necessary and appropriate, the Tribunal has edited the AUVM's underlying
data in order to adequately reflect its findings (infra §§ 1128.i.b), 1128.iii). For the sake of clarity, the case would

request for relief, the amount awarded to the Claimants for the harm suffered as a
result of the Income Tax Increase and the Expropriation is calculated as of 27 May
2016.

Having set out its conclusions in respect of the above preliminary issues pertaining to
DA compensation, the Tribunal will now proceed to address the Parties’ arguments
regarding the various inputs based on which the DA compensation is to be
calculated. As noted above, both Parties generally agree on the inputs that are
applicable for calculating the indemnity payable under the DA provisions of the
AAs.®° In essence, it is common ground that the indemnity is calculated on the basis
of the Projects’ lost cash flows, which in turn are obtained by “multiplying the Projects’
production volumes by the prices at which the resulting products are sold; and
costs and taxes are then subtracted, yielding net cash flows”.6%

In the following sections, the Tribunal shall therefore assess the Parties’ positions on
each of these inputs, namely, production volumes (Section B), Oil Prices (Section C),
Costs (Section D), and the applicable fiscal regime i.e. taxes (Section E). The
Tribunal shall also determine the adequate interest rate to bring the lost historical
cash flows forward to present value (Section F), as well as the reasonable discount
rate to bring future cash flows back to present value (Section G). Finally, the Tribunal
will decide upon some other issues that, while having certain impact on quantum,
have not been subject to major contention between the Parties (Section H).

PRODUCTION VOLUMES
The Claimants’ position

The first step in the Claimants’ assessment of its damages is to determine the volume
of oil that both Projects would have produced had the Claimants remained in
possession of their investments, namely “but-for” the Expropriation. In predicting the
EHCO production profiles for each of the Projects, the Claimants’ valuation expert,
Mr. Abdala, claims to have adopted the “most conservative of the pre-expropriation

 

have been no different had the Tribunal opted to rely on the BFVM or any other of the valuation models submitted
by the Parties. In this respect the Tribunal notes that, by opting for an all-or-nothing approach, coupled with a lack
of customization and the absence of a clear issue-by-issue quantification, the Parties’ valuation models were
somewhat restrictive.

profiles produced by the Projects and their shareholders prior to the
[E]xpropriation”.892

According to Mr. Abdala, the pre-Expropriation (and consequently pre-dispute)
production figures reflect the shared expectations of the Project participants, including
PDVSA, about the probable level of oil production and therefore constitute the best
evidence of expected oil production volumes to assist in the application of a but-for
analysis.®°5 He is of the view that it would be misleading to rely on actual production
data available for the Projects because in his view, the actual performance of the
Projects in the post-Expropriation period reflects the incentives of the Respondents, a
state-owned entity, and such incentives would have differed from those of a private
commercial entity like the Claimants. As such, he opines that the Projects’ actual
performance after June 2007 is not representative of how the Projects would have
performed in the absence of the Expropriation.®%

In light of the above, Mr. Abdala makes the following forecasts regarding the
expected production levels at the Projects applying the but-for test:

a. for the Petrozuata Project, he projects the remaining EHCO recovery between
June 2007 and 2036 to be 913.5 million barrels; and

b. for the Hamaca Project, he projects the remaining EHCO recovery between
June 2007 and 2037 to be 1.864 billion barrels.

The Claimants submit that various contemporaneous business-planning documents,
and more importantly, the post-Expropriation Proved Reserves figures for the
Petrozuata and Huyapari fields published by the Ministry,®°* confirm the reliability of
Mr. Abdala’s production forecasts.°9”

896 Both Projects were provided with a designated production field from which to produce the EHCO. The
designated field of the Petrozuata Project comprised a Base Area and a Reserves Area both of which were
ultimately exploited for EHCO. The Hamaca Project's field comprised of a main area, known as “H” (short for
Huyapari) Block, and a reserve area known as “M” (short for Maquiritare) Block. It appears that the M Block was
relinquished by the Hamaca Project prior to the Expropriation. (Figuera, WS |, RWS-2, § 33) Hence, while
referring to the Hamaca Project, the Tribunal shall use the phrase “Hamaca field” or “Huyapari field”
interchangeably.

Turning to the Respondents’ case on production volumes, the Claimants submit that
the Tribunal must reject the Respondents’ production forecasts on a number of
grounds. First, the Claimants argue that as a matter of principle, the Respondents’
production forecast is not reliable because (i) the Respondents have failed to produce
any post-Expropriation figures/documents that contradict the Claimants’ case;®° (ii)
the decline in production alluded to by the Respondents is not reconcilable with their
own Proved Reserves figures; and (iii) any actual decline in production volumes post-
Expropriation is attributable to the Respondents’ mismanagement of the Projects and
cannot be taken into account when applyling a “but-for” analysis.

The Claimants also call into question the methodology followed by the Respondents’
experts to arrive at the production figures for the Projects on various grounds.

Finally, the Claimants also address certain Project specific issues that according to

the Respondents affect production volumes.

In sum, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal should reject the Respondents’
“made-for-arbitration” production forecasts and should instead adopt the production
forecasts presented by Mr. Abdala — these being a reasonable and conservative
estimate of expected oil production volumes — for quantifying damages.

The Respondents’ position

In contrast to the Claimants, the Respondents base their production profile on “what
[actually] transpired in the historical period through 2015, as well as the assessment
of the EHCO production capacity at the [Petrozuata and Huyapari fields] by their
expert [for the future period]”.®°° In particular, their production profile is developed as
follows:

i. For the historical period i.e. 2007-2015, the Respondents rely on the “actual

performance” of the Projects, namely:

a) for the period June 2007 to 31 December 2008, the Respondents
rely on actual EHCO and Commercial Crude Oil (“CCO”)9° produced
by the Projects, as reported by their witness Mr. Figuera;"'

898 C-PHB, §§ 607-611.
899 R-PHB, § 668; Brailovsky & Flores ER |, RER-3, § 27.

900 CCO is also referred to as “synthetic crude oil” or “SCO” (i.e. the upgraded EHCO that is ultimately sold in the
market). For the purposes of its Award, the Tribunal will employ CCO to refer to the upgraded product.

247

b) for the years 2009 through 2015, the Respondents rely on actual
CCO volumes as presented by Mr. Figuera and on this basis, their
expert Mr. Patifio estimates the EHCO volumes that would have
been associated with such CCO volumes.

ii. For the projection period (i.e. 1 January 2016 till the expiry of the terms of the
AAs), the Respondents rely on the EHCO production profiles forecasted for
each Project by their expert, Mr. Patifio, by taking into account the factors
affecting production specific to each Project.

597. On the Respondents’ experts’ analysis applying the but-for test, the following
production volumes at the Projects are predicted:

c. for the Petrozuata Project, they project that from 26 June 2007 through the
end of the original term of the Petrozuata AA, the Petrozuata Project would
produce 522 million barrels of EHCO and sell 449 million barrels of CCO;9°?
and

d. for the Hamaca Project, they project that from 26 June 2007 through the end
of the original term of the Hamaca AA, the Hamaca Project would produce
1.051 billion barrels of EHCO and sell 990 million barrels of CCO.9°

598. The Respondents contest the Claimants’ reliance on pre-Expropriation production
profiles. The Respondents submit that an ex post or date of Award quantum analysis
— as undertaken by Mr. Abdala — must take into account “all of the information
available at the date of analysis [...] and therefore [attempt] to reflect the actual
development of events, rather than [...] forecasts made at the date of breach”.°%4 On
this basis, the Respondents argue that the Claimants cannot act as if the decades old
business plans on which their production forecasts were based, were “immutable”
and insulated from the negative developments that took place in the post-
Expropriation Projects. On the contrary, the Respondents assert that the 2006

models on which the Claimants rely were “overly optimistic [even] when they were

prepared.”9°5

Further, the Respondents dispute the Claimants’ reliance on the Ministry's and
PDVSA’s Proved Reserves figures as a basis for corroborating the reliability of the
pre-Expropriation forecasts. They contend that these figures are not comparable with

the figures used by the Claimants for their production forecast.

Finally, the Respondents also raise specific upstream (relating to oil production) and
downstream (relating to upgrading of EHCO into CCO and other by-products) issues
with respect to each of the two Projects, which in their view undermine the Claimants’

production forecast.

More specifically, in relation to the Petrozuata Project, the Respondents assert that
the Petrozuata Project was already experiencing a downward trend pre-Expropriation
and this was likely to have continued even after June 2007. As regards downstream
issues, the Respondents assert that the Petrozuata upgrader faced several technical
problems that reduced its performance.

In relation to the Hamaca Project, the Respondents primarily assert the existence of
operational difficulties with the Hamaca upgrader and its coker unit. According to the
Respondents, such problems would have arisen regardless of who was managing the
Projects, resulting in reduced production and consequently reduced earnings for the
Claimants.

In sum, the Respondents conclude that in carrying out their analysis on production,
the Claimants have created a “make-believe world that never would have existed no
matter who participated in the Projects”.°°° Accordingly, the Respondents assert that
the Tribunal should reject the “utopian environment” assumed by the Claimants in

favor of the realistic analysis presented by the Respondents.
Analysis

Having studied the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal finds that the disputed issues
fall into two broad categories: (i) issues common to both Projects; and (ii) issues
specific to each Project. With respect to issues common to both Projects, these
concern the methodology adopted for arriving at the production volumes i.e. pre-

905 SoD, §§ 347-348; R-PHB, § 539.

Expropriation figures relied on by the Claimants or the methodology adopted by the
Respondents based on Mr. Figuera’s and Mr. Patifio’s analysis. One aspect of this
issue is the Claimants’ reliance on Proved Reserves figures for corroborating its
proposed production forecast. As regards issues specific to each Project, the Tribunal
has highlighted them at Sections IV.B.3.c and IV.B.3.d below.

The Tribunal will first address the common issues and then proceed to the issues that
are specific to each Project. To the extent necessary, the Tribunal will highlight the
specific questions that arise for its decision prior to commencing its analysis on the
two broad categories of issues.

What methodology should be adopted for determining the production volumes
for the Projects?

i. The Claimants’ position

While setting out the Claimants’ position on production volumes, the Tribunal will first
elaborate upon the Claimants’ own position (1) and subsequently set out the
Claimants’ responses to the production forecast proposed by the Respondents (2).

(1) The Claimants’ production forecast

As discussed above, the Claimants’ approach to establishing oil production applying
the but-for test is to rely on the pre-Expropriation forecasts and project this into the ex
post period. The Claimants submit that pre-Expropriation forecasts are regularly relied
upon by international tribunals to determine expected production levels in the but-for
application as they constitute the best evidence of the parties’ expectations during a

“business as usual” period.”

Accordingly, Mr. Abdala relies on the ConocoPhillips Composite Economic Model, as
updated in late 2006 (“Composite Economic Model’), as the basis for forecasting
production at the Petrozuata Project between June 2007 and 2036.° For the
Hamaca Project, Mr. Abdala relies on the Petrolera Ameriven Economic Model

907 Reply, § 313; C-PHB, §§ 617-620; ADC v. Hungary, Award, CLA-13, §§ 506-507 (“One of the Respondent's
main criticisms concerns [the] reliance on the 2002 Business Plan of the Project Company [...] as a basis for the
DCF calculations, [...] because it would not provide a reliable basis on which to base projections as to the future
performance of the Project Company for the purposes of assessing damages [...]. The Tribunal disagrees since
the 2002 Business Plan was approved by ATAA [...] a few days before the Decree was issued that led to the
expropriation and after five drafts had been discussed between the Quota Shareholders. The 2002 Business
Plan, therefore, constitutes the best evidence before the Tribunal of the expectations of the parties at the time of
expropriation for the expected stream of cash flows”); Mobil ICC Award, CLA-16, § 771.

(‘Ameriven Model”) prepared by the operating company of the Hamaca Project and
updated as of October 2006.9 The Claimants submit that Mr. Abdala’s production
forecast of 913.5 million barrels of oil for the Petrozuata Project and 1.864 billion
barrels for the Hamaca Project based on the above Models is consistent with the
contemporaneous pre-Expropriation business planning documents. In fact, the
Claimants assert that Mr. Abdala’s figures are more conservative than the projections
in any of these documents, and should therefore be adopted.

As regards the Petrozuata Project, Mr. Abdala compares the Composite Economic
Model to the following: (i) the 2006 Petrozuata Economic Model maintained by the
Petrozuata Project itself, which predicted the Petrozuata Project's Proved Reserves
at 1.192 billion barrels of EHCO;9"° (ii) the 2006 Petrozuata Business Plan, which
forecasted total production of 1.235 billion barrels of EHCO from 2006 to 2036;9"t and
(iii) the Petrozuata_2005 Annual Report, which projected that the Project would
produce more than 1.6 billion barrels of EHCO over its operating life.’ Mr. Abdala
submits that the figures in the Composite Economic Model represent the most up-to-
date information regarding production prior to the Expropriation. Moreover, the figures
are compatible with those indicated in all of the above-mentioned business
documents. Accordingly, Mr. Abdala asserts that his figures correctly estimate
production volumes of the Petrozuata Project.°1>

With respect to the Hamaca Project, Mr. Abdala states that the production forecast in
the Ameriven Model is consistent with the production forecast in (i) the 2005 Hamaca
Business Plan, which was the last business plan approved by all Project participants,
including the Respondents, before the Expropriation;9"4 (ii) the 2006 Hamaca Draft
Business Plan, which projects the figures for 2007 to 2016 and was prepared while
Mr. Figuera was still the President of Ameriven;®'° and (iii) the 2006 ConocoPhillips

Economic Model, which projects recovery of 1.894 billion barrels of EHCO over the
life of the Hamaca Project.27°

The Claimants further assert that the Respondents themselves endorsed the above
documents. For instance, they point to the fact that the Respondents’ witness, Mr.
Figuera, signed the Petrozuata 2005 Annual Report in his capacity as the President
of Petrozuata C.A., approving the expected production of 1.6 billion barrels of EHCO
over the life of the Project, as of 2005.%"” Similarly, in respect of the Hamaca Project,
the Claimants contend that the Hamaca JVC itself prepared the Ameriven Model.°"8
Thus, the Claimants submit that the Respondents’ proposition that the pre-
Expropriation production profile was “overly optimistic’®'® and “utopian”®?° (and thus
unreliable) is untenable.

In any event, the Claimants submit that for all their reliance on post-Expropriation
developments, the Respondents have failed to produce any evidence in support of
their assertion that after the Expropriation the “Projects promptly fell to pieces”. For
instance, despite the Tribunal’s directions; the Respondents have allegedly not
produced any current business plans or post-Expropriation production forecasts that
contradict the Claimants’ position.°21 Moreover, the Claimants also emphasize that
the Respondents’ witness on production volumes, Mr. Figuera, was not involved in
the Projects since the Expropriation and thus does not have personal knowledge of
their post-Expropriation production potential.°22

(2) The Clai ’ position on the | prod

 

The Claimants and their experts, Mr. Abdala and Mr. Strickland, challenge the
competing production forecast advanced by the Respondents on various grounds.
First, the Claimants assert that as a matter of principle, post-expropriation
performance data cannot be taken as reflective of the Projects’ performance in the
but-for application as the Projects were under PDVSA's control (2.1).92 Second, the

Claimants’ experts assert that there are numerous flaws in the methodology followed
by Mr. Patifio to forecast production, which thoroughly undermine its reliability (2.2).
Third, and in any event, the Claimants’ experts also submit that there are errors in the
principle components that Mr. Patifio uses for his analysis (2.3). Each of these are
addressed in turn.

2.1. The Respondents’ production forecasts cannot be used in application of
the but-for test

As noted above, the Respondents rely on actual figures for the post-Expropriation
performance of the Projects. The Claimants submit that these figures cannot be
accepted as accurate and reflective of what could have been achieved by the
Projects but for the Expropriation for the following reasons.

First, the Claimants submit that since the Expropriation, the Projects have been
majority owned and controlled by PDVSA, which has entirely different priorities and
capabilities from a private commercial entity such as the Claimants. In particular, the
Claimants reiterate that PDVSA has become the Government's “cash cow” and most
of its revenues are diverted to fund the “obscure” social programs and activities of the
Government. The Claimants conclude that as a result, PDVSA's “priorities have
shifted — and its performance [at the Projects] has suffered.”925

Second, the Claimants submit that under the Chavez administration, PDVSA suffered
from a “brain-drain”, inasmuch as in 2003 the Chavez administration dismissed over
18,000 PDVSA employees, several of which were their most experienced engineers,
and replaced them with “hired flunkies willing to toe the regime line.”°° Moreover, “a
further exodus of experienced employees commenced in 2007, with the
[Elxpropriation of the [...] [P]rojects”.92” According to the Claimants, this loss of its “oil
intelligentsia” (comprising experienced Venezuelan personnel as well as personnel
brought in by the foreign oil companies) was a “blow from which PDVSA has never
recovered” and has left a permanent negative impact on oil exploration and project
management.98

620.

Third, the Claimants emphasize that there have been repeated and widespread
reports of mismanagement and corruption by PDVSA. In particular, the Claimants
point to a 2015 Government report based on an inspection of PDVSA-operated
facilities, including Petrozuata, which found inter alia “[gleneral deterioration of the
upgraders’ physical structure due to deficient maintenance.”**9 Moreover, this report
also noted that there were “[h]igh rates of insecurity and cases of extortion [in the
Orinoco Oil Belt] [...] as shown by payments charged by organized mafias to allow
the performance of daily duties of productive activities [...]”.°°° Further, a 2016 report
by the Permanent Auditing Committee of Venezuela’s National Assembly concluded
that senior members of PDVSA’s management, including former President Rafael
Ramirez and current President Eulogio Del Pino, were allegedly guilty of
“administrative irregularities”.°°' This included allegations of bribery and the
mismanagement of PDVSA funds that reportedly cost the company more than USD
11 billion between 2004 and 2014.

Overall, the Claimants assert that post-Expropriation, the “new PDVSA” was a
substantially different entity in terms of its practices and competencies and this is
precisely why the post-Expropriation performance of the Projects cannot be used to
compute damages in a but-for test application.

2.2. _ There are fundamental flaws in the Respondents’ methodology

Next, the Claimants call into question the competing production forecasts advanced
by the Respondents based on Mr. Figuera’s testimony and Mr. Patifio’s analysis. In
this respect the Claimants’ submissions are two-fold: first, that the Respondents’
production profile for the historical period is “anti-historical” and ignores actual EHCO
production without any basis; and second, that Mr. Patifio’s methodology for
calculating the Projects’ production profiles for the future period is “demonstrably
wrong” and is not confirmed by any “reality checks”.

As regards the production figures for the historical period (i.e. 2009 — 2015), the
Claimants note that Mr. Patifio does not base his case on the volumes of EHCO
actually extracted from the Petrozuata and Hamaca fields. Rather, he estimates the
EHCO volumes that would be needed to produce the amounts of CCO actually sold

by the Projects.%°? In doing so, the Claimants assert that the Respondents omit from
their production profile for this period approximately 97 million barrels of EHCO. The
“lost oil” can be illustrated as follows:9%3

Production of ECHO (Bimal par Oy)

621. According to the Claimants, the reasons cited by the Respondents to justify their
calculation is entirely without basis. The Claimants submit that, as admitted by Mr.
Figuera during the Hearing, the pre-Expropriation Projects routinely produced and
sold non-upgraded blended products and the Ministry was fully aware of this fact.4
Therefore, the EHCO that was allegedly commercialized in non-upgraded form
cannot be excluded from production volumes when applying the but for test.

622. As regards the Respondents’ reliance on the Ministry's letter of 23 June 2005, the
Claimants contend that this letter did not prohibit the production and sale of blended
non-upgraded products by the pre-Expropriation Projects. Rather, it was a “tax bill”
that demanded the Projects to pay a higher royalty for the non-upgraded EHCO.%>

982 SoD, §§ 417, 473; Tr. (Day 9), 2358:9-2359:4 (Mr. Patifio) (Q. So, is it not correct that, for those years, by

Mr. Figuera that were produced during that period of time. Q. Right. So, when we look in your model for those

they actually sold; is that right? A. Correct, yes. Q. And you tell us in your Reports that the volumes of EHCO that
the Projects actually extracted over those years 2009 to 2015 are bigger than the numbers reflected in your
Report corresponding to the syncrude sales; correct? A. That is correct, yes).

255

623. In light of the above, the Claimants contend that the Respondents’ attempt to
disregard the actual EHCO production between 2009-2015 i.e. the historical period, in
the but-for test application must be rejected.

624. As regards the future period (i.e. 1 January 2016 onwards), the Claimants assert that
Mr. Patifio’s production forecasts are “demonstrably wrong”.%9°

625. Mr. Patifio’s production forecasts for the future period are premised on three main
components:%9” (i) decline rates, being the rate at which the wells drilled in the
Petrozuata and Huyapari fields will decline; (ii) well targets or the drilling of additional
wells, in order to determine how many new wells could be drilled from 2009 to
maintain the necessary levels of production; and (iii) initial production potential, which
estimates the initial rate at which each new well would produce oil till the decline
began.%8

626. The Claimants’ expert Mr. Strickland explains that the above methodology is a
“simple decline curve methodology” and states that it is “overly simplistic and ill-suited
for the purposes of forecasting future [EHCO] production volumes” of the Projects.999
Instead, according to Mr. Strickland, based on the quantity and quality of data
available for both Projects, the geophysical characteristics of the EHCO, and the
development strategy employed by the Parties, “the use of reservoir modeling at
Hamaca and advanced decline curve techniques at Petrozuata [...] were appropriate
and reliable methods to employ”.%4°

627. According to Mr. Strickland, simple decline curve analysis is inapposite for forecasting
long-term oil production as it may inter-alia fail to account for changing operating
conditions and as a result underestimate future production. Conversely, advance
decline curve analysis is more rigorous as it “go[es] beyond merely extrapolating the

99 Strickland ER, CER-6, §§ 5, 20-36.

°40 Strickland ER, CER-6, §§ 20-35 (Mr. Strickland explains that the basis of Decline Rate analysis is the
assumption that future production will continue to follow a past trend i.e. that the data is “well behaved” and not
erratic and that there is sufficient historical data. Separately, he criticizes the use of the simple form of decline
curve analysis not only because it is more rudimentary than the advanced decline curve (or reservoir modeling)
approaches, but also because in his view the fields in the Orinoco Belt have certain characteristics that make the
simple decline curve analysis susceptible to significant error. He explains that simple decline curves work best
with reservoirs that have high oil mobility. However, given the high viscosity of the EHCO in the Orinoco Belt,
including at Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects, the reservoirs have relatively low mobility. Production
characteristics of low mobility reservoirs include long transient periods where the decline rate is high at first and
then gradually changes to even lower decline rates. Hence, in his view, a simple decline curve cannot account for
such variations).

rate of decline; [and] also account[s] for principles of thermodynamics and physics,
and can take into account observed conditions in the field, [...] making the estimate of
future production more accurate.”°4' Similarly, reservoir modeling is the most
advanced technology available for forecasting recovery and can give a “level of

precision and accuracy that the [...] other methods [...] cannot match.”%42

628. Mr. Strickland also notes that advanced decline curve techniques were employed at
the Petrozuata field and reservoir modelling was employed at the Huyapari field, and
states that these are far more sophisticated and therefore capable of yielding more

accurate results than the methodology applied by Mr. Patino.%?

629. Mr. Strickland then proceeds to address what he considers to be the main flaws in Mr.

Patino’s methodology:

a. First, Mr. Patino did not have a sufficiently large sample set based on which to
conduct his decline rate analysis. Mr. Strickland notes that Mr. Patino’s criteria
for selecting his sample set®* and his exclusion of “outlier wells"®° left him
with only “124 from Petrozuata’s 395 total existing wells, and 55 from
Hamaca’s 346 total wells”, to conduct his analysis.%*° According to the
Claimants, it is obvious from the numbers that Mr. Patino’s methodology was

unsuited for a vast majority of the wells at both fields.

b. Second, Mr. Patino erred by applying the same decline rate to all wells —
existing and future — included in his forecasts for both fields, without first
confirming whether the average decline rate was even representative of the
existing wells in the field.°”

°3 Strickland ER, CER-6, § 35.

°4 Mr. Patifio examined wells that could provide six years of data devoid of erratic behaviour. It appears that by
virtue of timing, these wells happened to be the earliest wells drilled and therefore likely to be the wells drilled in
the best parts of the field.

631.

632.

c. Third, Mr. Patino’s decline rate analysis conflates two different types of wells,
ie. those exhibiting an exponential decline%® and those exhibiting a
hyperbolic decline? and instead treats them all as exponential wells.

d. Fourth, Mr. Patino failed to undertake the most obvious reality checks of his
results in order to ensure that they were accurate. In particular, (i) he did not
attempt to reconcile his forecast with the Ministry's Proved Reserves figures
allegedly because “he was not asked to do [so]”;9®° (ii) he did not ask for and
obtain long-term oil production forecasts produced by the post-Expropriation
Projects. Moreover, although he asked for them, Mr. Patino was not provided
with the post-Expropriation Projects’ long-term forecasting tools and omitted to
mention this in his Expert Report; and, finally, (iii) he did not test his forecasts
against the actual EHCO production from the Petrozuata and Huyapari fields
as reported by PDVSA.%1

Because of the above errors, the Claimants assert that Mr. Patino’s methodology
“overstates the decline rate of the fields and, relatedly, understates the expected
ultimate recovery”.°? To reinforce their point, the Claimants emphasize that as a
result of applying an incorrect methodology, Mr. Patino’s production forecasts
“represent[ed] about 51% of the volumes [...] upon which the damages calculated by
the Claimants’ damages experts are based”.°5> Accordingly, the Claimants conclude
that no confidence can be placed in Mr. Patino’s results.

2.3. There are errors in the principle components of Mr. Patifio’s
methodology

Lastly, the Claimants also point to what, in their view, are technical errors in the

various components of Mr. Patino’s methodology.

As set out above, Mr. Patino’s methodology comprises three components: (i)
decline rate analysis; (ii) determination of remaining wells; and (iii) the initial potential
production analysis for the new wells. According to Mr. Strickland, Mr. Patino reaches

48 Strickland ER, CER-6, § 40(b) (an exponential decline is a constant rate of decline over time).

demonstrably erroneous conclusions on (i) and (ii) above. However, subject to his
overarching objections to Mr. Patino’s methodology, Mr. Strickland accepts the initial
production figures used by Mr. Patino for his analysis.9°°

633. With respect to Mr. Patino’s decline rate analysis, the Claimants assert that the most
egregious error made by Mr. Patino is to conflate exponential and hyperbolic wells
and apply the same exponential decline rate for forecasting production from all wells.
According to the Claimants, because hyperbolic wells decline more gradually than
exponential wells, they are likely to produce more oil than wells that decline
exponentially, over the same period of time. The Claimants observe that in the
sample set chosen by Mr. Patino nearly half the wells were hyperbolic. Thus, by virtue
of his flawed analysis, the Claimants submit that Mr. Patino overstates the decline
rates and understates production at “Petrozuata by approximately 367 million barrels
of oil and at Hamaca by approximately 712 million barrels of oil”.95° The Claimants
assert that if Mr. Patino had undertaken his calculations correctly, the average decline
rate for the Petrozuata Project would be 12.2% and 13% for the Hamaca Project.%”
By way of a reality check, the Claimants submit that Mr. Patino’s decline curves for
both Petrozuata and Hamaca fall well below the actual production history of the post-
Expropriation Projects.9°°

634. With respect to the determination of remaining well targets, Mr. Strickland states that
first, Mr. Patifio’s selection criteria for viable new well targets are unduly restrictive. In
this respect, Mr. Strickland explains that Mr. Patino applies unrealistic standards to
determine which areas of the field constitute targets that can be economically drilled.
To support this conclusion, Mr. Strickland cross-checks Mr. Patino’s criteria against
the wells already drilled and demonstrates that if Mr. Patino’s criteria were to be

98 Strickland ER, CER-6, § 76.

986 C-PHB, §§ 698-701; Strickland ER, CER-6, §§ 61-64, 75. The Tribunal notes that other errors in the
Respondents’ decline rate analysis have been highlighted by Mr. Strickland. In particular, Mr. Strickland asserts
that Mr. Patifio incorrectly relies on “well test” data as opposed to “allocated production data” to perform the
decline rate analysis. Mr. Strickland explains that at most oil fields the production of individual wells is not
recorded. Rather, the volume produced for a group of wells is recorded and then periodic well tests are used to
allocate volumes to each well within the group. This was presumable the procedure in place for both the Projects
before and after Expropriation. Well-test data on the other hand measures the amount of oil that can be extracted
under the test conditions and is therefore not reflective of production conditions. (Strickland ER, CER-6, §§ 44-46)
Mr. Strickland is of the view that while well-test data can be used to calculate decline curves it requires additional
analysis to account for operating conditions and operational changes, a step which Mr. Patifio fails to take into
account. The other error with the decline rate analysis is to use the same decline rate for existing as well as new
wells.

°57 Strickland Consolidated ICSID Report, fn. 75. This translates to the estimated ultimate recovery from January
2009 until the end of the Project terms being 585 million barrels for Petrozuata and 1.402 billion barrels for
Hamaca.

applied, then several presently drilled wells would never have been drilled in the first
place.%5° Moreover, Mr. Patino allegedly restricts his forecast for the Petrozuata
Project to only include single lateral wells. However, according to the Claimants, there
is no basis for this assumption because the Petrozuata Project has drilled multi-lateral
wells both before and after the Expropriation. Finally, it appears that Mr. Patino did
not cross-check his figures with the well-drilling plans of the post-Expropriation
Projects, thereby omitting the most basic “sense check”.

Second, Mr. Strickland states that despite applying overly strict criteria, Mr. Patifio
missed viable well targets.%°' In particular, Mr. Patino allegedly missed 22 viable
targets at the Petrozuata Project and 20 at the Hamaca Project.%? In the
circumstances, Mr. Strickland is of the view that Mr. Patino’s conclusion that there are
insufficient well targets to make up for the decline rate is incorrect. According to Mr.
Strickland, the difference in production volumes of not including these well targets is
approx. 18 million barrels of EHCO for both Petrozuata and Hamaca.%?

In light of the above, Mr. Strickland submits that the total additional volumes that will
be recovered according to Mr. Patino’s models once the errors are corrected are as

ji. The Respondents’ position

In contrast to the Claimants’ pre-Expropriation based production forecasts (which the
Respondents deem “aspirational”), the Respondents base their production forecasts
on the “years of actual performance data that post-date the 2006 models, and [which]
show that the ideal world underlying the modeling in 2006 was completely

unrealistic”.9°

First, the Respondents address the Claimants’ insinuation that post-Expropriation
figures cannot be relied upon because they reflect what has been achieved under the
“new PDVSA” which would have thus been vastly different had the Claimants
remained with the Projects. According to the Respondents:

[The] Claimants have never been able to explain why it should be assumed that

at [the Projects], where PDVSA personnel held and would have continued to

hold the highest management positions, including the position of President,

where the PDVSA subsidiary would have held a blocking vote on all significant

decisions, and where the vast majority of employees were locally hired

Venezuelan nationals, the presence of a handful of ConocoPhillips secondees

would have dramatically changed the results achieved in the post-

nationalization period.9®°
The Respondents submit that the presence of a few ConocoPhillips employees
assigned to the Projects would not have changed anything in the post-Expropriation
Projects. This is because in both the pre- and post-Expropriation Projects, the PDVSA
Subsidiaries would have held the position of control and the ability to steer the
Projects. This was required by the 1975 Nationalization Law,%’ as well as the
Congressional Authorizations for the Projects and came to be reflected in the AAs.
For instance, fundamental and significant decisions could not be adopted without the
approval of the PDVSA Subsidiary®® and the Presidents of both Petrozuata CA and
the Hamaca JVC were required to be PDVSA appointees.” Given these
circumstances, the Respondents assert that the mere participation of the Claimants in
the Projects, however “active”, would not have altered the course of events as they in

fact came to pass.°”' It would not have altered the problems faced by the Hamaca
upgrader®”? or for that matter the geophysical characteristics of the Petrozuata and
Huyapari fields, which would have suffered the same decline they did post-

Expropriation.

640. As regards the Claimants’ assertion that the post-Expropriation Projects had different
incentives under the “new PDVSA’, the Respondents submit that this argument
“makes no sense”. This is because PDVSA is no more “interested in throwing money
at a project without at least attempting to improve performance”, than any other
commercial oriented international oil company like the Claimants.9’° The above
statement holds even greater relevance in respect of the Hamaca Project, where
Chevron — an international oil company like the Claimants — remained a participant in

the post-Expropriation Project.9”4

641. Having addressed the Claimants’ main objections to using the Respondents’
forecasts, the Respondents then proceed to explaining their production forecasts.

642. In that respect, the Tribunal notes that for the period June 2007 to 31 December
2008, the Respondents rely on actual EHCO and CCO produced by the Projects, as
reported by their witness Mr. Figuera.9’5 According to Mr. Figuera:

In 2007, Petrozuata produced a total of 36,044,474 bbls of EHCO (an average
of 98,752 BPD), sold 29,666,968 Bbls of upgraded crude oil (an average of
81,279 BPD), and received total revenues from such sales of US$1.814 billion,
for an average sales price of US$61.51 per barrel.”

In 2008, Petrozuata produced a total of 41,398,549 Bbls of EHCO (an average
of 113,111 BPD), sold 35,700,904 Bbls of upgraded crude oil (an average of
97,543 BPD), and received total revenues from such sales of US$3.119 billion,
for an average sales price of US$87.38 per barrel.°””

In 2007, the Hamaca Project produced a total of 57,150,178 Bbls of EHCO (an
average of 156,576 BPD), sold 53,547,480 Bbls of upgraded crude oil (an
average of 146,705 BPD), and received total revenues from such sales of
US$3.518 billion, for an average sales price of US$65.71 per barrel.°”°

In 2008, the Hamaca Project produced a total of 58,112,475 Bbls of EHCO (an
average of 158,777 BPD), sold 52,430,724 Bbls of upgraded crude oil (an
average of 143,253 BPD), and received total revenues from such sales of
US$4.792 billion, for an average sales price of US$91.40 per barrel.979
Thereafter, for the remaining period, i.e. from 1 January 2009 to the end of the term
of each of the AAs, the Respondents rely on the EHCO production capacity programs

developed by their expert Mr. Patifio.

With respect to the historical period, i.e. 2009 through 2015, the Respondents point
out that although actual well-drilling and EHCO production data is available, the same
cannot be relied upon without suitable adjustments. This is because different
considerations applied to the volume of EHCO produced before and after 2009. The
Respondents submit that prior to January 2009, the Projects were allowed to sell only
upgraded products, i.e. CCO. In other words, all EHCO produced at the fields was
upgraded to CCO.%° However, starting in 2009, the post-Expropriation companies
were allowed to commercialize EHCO in other non-upgraded blended forms as well.
Consequently, the amount of EHCO produced by the post-Expropriation companies
was much higher than the volume of EHCO that would have been required for the
CCO actually sold in the historical period. The Respondents submit that in order to
calculate the volume of EHCO produced in the historical period, the same conditions
that had applied to the Projects under the AAs must be assumed. Considering that
the Projects under the AAs would not have been allowed to commercialize non-
upgraded products, any excess volume of EHCO must be excluded from production
volumes in a but-for analysis.°°"

In light of the Respondents’ instructions, in order to determine the EHCO volumes
produced by the Projects in the historical period but-for the Expropriation (i.e.
accepting that there has not been any sales of non-upgraded EHCO), Mr. Patifio
“estimate[ed] — not “forecast[ed]” or “predict[ed]’ — the EHCO volumes that would
have been needed for the [CCO] production achieved”.°®? In order to arrive at this

°81 R-PHB, § 668; Patifio RER-4, fn.14; ICSID Consolidated Report, § 19, fn. 29 (The Respondents’ expert
explains that at the upgrading projects, EHCO is blended with a diluent (usually naphtha) at the field to facilitate
its extraction and/or transportation. The blended product, known as diluted crude oil (“DCO”), is treated at a
facility in the Orinoco Oil Belt, where water and gas are removed, after which the DCO is transported by pipeline
to the upgrader at the Jose Industrial Complex on the northern coast of Venezuela. At the upgrader, the diluent is
separated and recycled to the field to be re-used to extract and transport new batches of DCO, while the EHCO is
upgraded to CCO. In addition to DCO, another non-upgraded product called Merey 16 can be produced if, instead
of blending the EHCO with naphtha diluent, the EHCO is blended with Mesa, a light crude oil produced by
PDVSA,).

figure, Mr. Patifio used the “yield factors” at the Petrozuata and Hamaca upgraders to
make the necessary calculations. Simply put, the yield factor reflects the amount of
CCO that will be produced per barrel of EHCO. Therefore, in order to calculate how
much EHCO would be required to achieve the volume of CCO that was actually sold
between 2009 to 2015, Mr. Patino merely divided the CCO volume by the yield factor
of the respective Projects.%° On this basis, Mr. Patifio arrived at the approximate
volume of EHCO that would be required to achieve the volume of CCO that was sold
in the historical period.°*4

646. Mr. Patifio then proceeds to determine the EHCO production capacity of each of the
Projects for the future period i.e. 1 January 2016 through the end of the terms of each
Project. In order to do so, Mr. Patifio utilizes the following elements:

(a) First, he estimates the potential production capacity that existed at each of the
fields as of 1 January 2009. In other words, he estimates the production of
EHCO that could have been achieved as of 2009, in light of the active wells
and wells that were inactive but could be reactivated quickly.985

(b) Second, he estimates the rate at which the potential production capacity will
decline i.e. the “Decline Rate”.

(c) Third, he estimates remaining “well targets” in the fields with the objective of
determining how many new wells can be drilled in the field, to replace the
production capacity that has been lost because of either natural decline or any
other reasons that prevent a well from producing desired levels of EHCO. For
this purpose, he assumes that new wells will be drilled only if their initial

°83 B&F ICSID Consolidated Report, §§ 19, 122 (Mr. Patifio explains that he uses a design yield factor of 0.947 for
the Hamaca Project and 0.8621 for the Petrozuata Project based on the capacity of their respective upgraders. To
determine how much EHCO would be required to achieve a known volume of CCO, he divided that volume by the
yield factor. By way of example, if Hamaca produced 100,000 BPD of CCO over a specified period, 105,597 BPD
of EHCO (i.e., 100,000 + 0.947) would have been necessary).

84 The Tribunal understands that the value so calculated would represent the actual volume of EHCO that was
necessary to produce a given volume of CCO. Mr. Patifio explains however that there are always short-term
problems at the field which can negatively affect production. As a result, oil projects always provide for a margin
of error between their production capacity and the actual production. In other words, the production capacity of a
field is always more than the actual production that a field achieves by a certain factor and forecasts will reflect
the “production capacity” rather than the “actual production”. This is referred to as the “potential production
capacity”. Mr. Patifio states that the “potential production capacity” is a theoretical figure, which reflects the
potential production of all active wells and those inactive wells that can be repaired rapidly and put back into use.
(See First Patifio ICSID Report, n.4). For the Orinoco Oil Belt, it appears that the potential production capacity is
estimated at 10% more than actual production. Accordingly as a final step to estimating the production volume of
EHCO in the historical period, Mr. Patifio multiplies the volume of EHCO by 110%. Accordingly, to take the
previously offered example (supra, fn. 983) one step further, to determine the EHCO production capacity needed
to produce 105,597 BPD of EHCO, one would multiply that figure by 110%, yielding an EHCO production capacity
of 116,156 BPD (ICSID Testimony, Patifio ER |, RER-4 Annex Il, § 3, fn. 6, 7).

potential production meets a certain threshold i.e. 200 BPD, as otherwise it
would not be viable.%° Because certain wells may fail and require
replacement, he also accounts for “Re-drilled” wells.

(d) Fourth, he estimates the production capacity that these new wells will add to
the overall production capacity of the field. In order to do so, he estimates the
actual “initial potential production” of the new wells and estimates the well’s
plateau period, before production begins to decline.

Mr. Patifio’s analysis of the above elements in respect of each Project is set out
below.

The Petrozuata Project

Production capacity as of 1 January 2009: Mr. Patifio determines that as of 1 January
2009, a total of 373 wells had been drilled, completed and connected at the
Petrozuata field. Of these 289 were active wells and 29 were wells that could be
brought back into service with minor repairs. Further, 12 additional wells were in the
process of being drilled and would be completed and connected to the production
facility in 2009. Based on the production data available, Mr Patifio concludes that as
of 1 January 2009, the production potential of the above wells combined is 118,200
BPD.°*’ The Tribunal notes that Mr. Strickland does not dispute this figure.2°*

Production capacity after 1 January 2009: Having determined the production capacity
at the start of his analysis, Mr. Patifio proceeded to determine the production capacity
of the field from 1 January 2009 onwards. In order to do so he “analyzed the decline
rate of the field and carried out an analysis to determine how many additional wells
could be drilled in the Base Area and the Reserve Area, as well as the

corresponding initial production potential of such wells.”%°°

988 Tr, (Day 8), 2154:13-19 (Mr. Strickland).

89 RER-4, § 19; ICSID Consolidated Patifio Report, §§ 22 (emphasis added). The Tribunal notes that the
Claimants’ expert Mr. Stickland is critical of the methodology followed as a whole as well as the estimations made
in respect of the decline rates and the number of new wells. It appears however that Mr. Strickland does not

dispute the initial potential production of the new wells. Strickland Second Report, §§ 3, 5, 11. Strickland ICSID
Consolidated Report; §§ 91-95.

265

650. First, Mr. Patifio notes that the Claimants have not undertaken a decline rate
analysis. Rather, they state that the Composite Economic Model assumes a decline
rate of 10-12%. However, the Respondents’ state that none of the contemporaneous
documents prepared by the Petrozuata Project actually support this low decline rate.
Rather they all predict a decline rate closer to 20%.% Mr. Patifio states that based on
his analysis of the Petrozuata field, the appropriate decline rate for the wells at the

Petrozuata field is approximately 22%.

651. In order to arrive at the abovementioned decline rate, Mr. Patifio conducts a well-by-
well decline study to determine which wells will be appropriate candidates for the
decline rate analysis. Based on his study, Mr. Patino arrives at a sample size of 124
wells.29' Then for each well, he determines whether the decline behavior of the well is
exponential, hyperbolic or harmonic. Based on this analysis, Mr. Patino concludes
that the most appropriate decline function to use for all the wells that are likely to be
drilled at the Petrozuata field over the entire term of the Project is the exponential
function.°° Having determined the best decline function, Mr. Patino performs a
statistical analysis and concludes that a decline rate of 22% is the most appropriate
rate to use for all wells of the field for the entire term of the Project.°%

652. In response to the Claimants’ criticism that an advanced decline curves methodology
should have been used to predict the production volumes at the Petrozuata field, Mr.
Patino submits that he analyzed the various components of the advanced decline
curve methodology and determined that the “accumulated production figures” that
were derived using this analysis very closely matched the production figures arrived
at using Mr. Patino’s methodology and an exponential decline rate of 22%.° The

990 R-PHB, §§ 648-649; Figuera, WS 1, RWS-2, App. 102; Figuera, WS 1, RWS-2, App. 103; Figuera, WS 1,
RWS-2, App. 152; Figuera, WS 1, RWS-2, App. 153.

°91 For this purpose, Mr. Patifio selects wells that have been in production for six years or more and do not
present erratic behavior. App. 23, Summary of Wells for the Decline Analysis of Petrozuata Production, June
2014; Appendix 45, Graphs and Data for each Well at Petrozuata in the Decline Study. It appears that his
analysis focused on only 124 of the 145 wells because 21 of the wells showed decline rates greater than 30%,
which in his view was indicative of very specific characteristics that could not be generalized across all wells. He
further notes that almost 15% of the wells that met the initial criteria for his decline study (the vast majority of
which were drilled prior to the nationalization) exhibited decline rates that exceeded 30%. See Annex I, First
ICSID Expert Report, § 91, n. 51. He further notes that wells that were drilled and connected to production in 2009
now have six years worth of production history, and 20 of those wells did not behave erratically. The data relating
to those wells reflect that 19 decline exponentially at an average decline rate of 25.2%. See Appendix 74,
Graphs and Data for the Decline Study for the Wells Connected in 2009 at Petrozuata.

992 Exponential decline rate is represented by a steady rate of decline whereas a Hyperbolic decline rate is an
initial steep decline followed by a more gentle slope decline (i.e. represented on a graph as a hyperbolic curve).

83 Consolidated Report, § 28.

994 Iq, He applies the decline rate to the production capacity as opposed to plotting the decline rate of each well
that contributes to production, as this figure is variable at any particular moment in time.

Respondents point to the fact that Mr. Strickland confirmed at the Hearing that Mr.
Patino’s calculations in this respect were accurate.9%°

In response to the criticism that Mr. Patino allegedly conflated exponential and
hyperbolic wells, the Respondents submit that the entire point of Mr. Patino’s analysis
— which Mr. Strickland missed — was to derive a decline rate that could be applied to
all of the wells at the field over the entire term of the Petrozuata Project.%”

Moreover, Mr. Patino also seeks to demonstrate that even if Mr. Strickland’s above
criticism were to be accepted and different decline rates were applied to existing and
new wells — i.e. lesser decline rates for the existing wells as they were drilled in the
best locations and higher decline rates for the new wells as they were drilled in less
favorable locations — the average decline rate would result in total production volume
which was only 13.8 million barrels more than the production volume obtained
through a 22% exponential decline rate.°%*

In sum, the Respondents conclude that:

No amount of technical jargon relating to “advance decline curves” or the
differences between exponential and hyperbolic decline functions can change
the reality that the Petrozuata field was declining at a steep rate and that every
contemporaneous document prepared by the Project estimated that rate to be
in the range of 20% per annum.°°9

b. Additional wells

Another aspect of the production capacity profile is to determine how many additional
well targets were available as of 2009. In that regard, Mr. Patino first reviewed and
confirmed that all the wells that were actually drilled and connected from 1 January
2009 to 31 December 2013 actually needed to be built and therefore would have
been included in his calculations as well. He then proceeded to determine whether it
was possible to drill additional wells beyond those actually drilled by 31 December
2013. In carrying out such an analysis, Mr. Patino considered geological and
petrophysical data relating to the field, existing places where such wells could be
drilled and finally if these potential wells would have an initial potential production of
at least 200 BPD. On this basis, Mr. Patino estimates that there are 262 new well
targets available.

Mr. Patino further notes that “[iJn total, with the 373 wells drilled and connected to
production through January 1 2009, the 12 wells drilled in 2008 that [presumably]
would have been completed and connected at the beginning of 2009, the 262 new
wells located in his review of the data and maps, the 68 single-lateral wells that [he]
determined could be drilled to exploit production blocks previously being drained by
failed multilateral wells and the 42 “re-drill” single lateral wells, [his] production
capacity program assumes a total of 757 wells”.1°°

c. Initial potential production

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

658. Mr. Patino assessed the geological and petrophysical characteristics of the
Petrozuata Field, the particular locations where new wells could be drilled as well as
the production tests of neighbouring wells, and arrived at initial potential production
rates for each of the new wells that he had identified would be constructed during the
life of the Project.1°°"

659. The Claimants’ expert, Dr. Strickland originally claimed that the initial potential
production rate for the new wells at Petrozuata had been underestimated by about
16%. However, it appears that Dr. Strickland now concedes that Mr. Patino’s
calculations were accurate. 102

were drilled and connected as of January 1, 2009, the 12 carry-over wells, and the 320 wells mentioned in the
text. It should also be noted that over the life of the Petrozuata Project, approximately 420 single lateral horizontal
wells would be drilled. Some of those wells would fail and a replacement well could be drilled using the same
surface hole. In the case of Petrozuata, one can assume that approximately 10% of the single-lateral wells (42 in
total) would be re-drilled over the life of the project, from 2009 through about 2025, at which point any wells that
failed would likely not be re-drilled because of their low (below 50 BPD) production. Thus, with the single-lateral
re-drills, the grand total of wells drilled over the life of the Petrozuata Project, was 747 wells).

He concludes that the volume of EHCO that would be produced at the Petrozuata
Project using cold production techniques would total 848.4 million barrels from the
outset of the Project through the end of its original term in April 2036, with 461 million

barrels being produced starting on January 1, 2009.10
The Hamaca Project
The Respondents undertake a similar analysis in relation to the Hamaca Project.

Production capacity as of 1 January 2009: Mr. Patifio determines that as of 1 January
2009, a total of 325 wells had been drilled, completed and connected at the Huyapari
field of the Hamaca Project. Of these 266 were active wells and 43 were wells that
could be brought back into service with minor repairs. Further, 32 additional wells
were in the process of being drilled. These 32 wells would be completed and
connected to the production facility in 2009. Based on the production data available,
Mr Patifio concludes that as of 1 January 2009, the production potential of the above
wells is 201,200 BPD.1°° Mr. Strickland does not dispute this figure.1°°

Production capacity from _1 January 2009 onwards: as with the Petrozuata Project,
Mr. Patifio proceeded to determine the production capacity of the field from 1 January
2009 onwards by determining the (i) decline rate; (ii) the additional new wells that
would need to be drilled; and (iii) initial production capacity of these wells.

a. Decline Rate

Mr. Patino performs the same well-by-well decline analysis and arrives at a sample
set of 65 wells that meet his relevant criteria, namely, six years or more of production
history without erratic behaviour.1°°” Next, he identifies the points in time when the
decline period of each well would begin and whether the decline would be
exponential, hyperbolic or harmonic in nature. As with the Petrozuata Project, Mr.
Patino concludes that the appropriate decline function to be applied to all the wells
would be exponential and the appropriate decline rate for the wells at the Huyapari
field is 24%.1008

As with the Petrozuata Project, Mr. Patino sought to determine the decline rate for all
the wells at each field. In any event, Mr. Patino submits that if he were to apply
different decline rates to old wells and new wells, then the accumulated production
over the life of the Hamaca Project would actually be 1.8 million barrels less than the
production volumes arrived at using his methodology of a single exponential decline

rate.1009
b. Additional wells

In the same manner in which he had analyzed the data for the Petrozuata field, Mr.
Patino analyzed the data for the Huyapari field to determine how many additional
wells could be drilled during the term of the Hamaca Project in order to maintain
overall production capacity at the field at 110% of the actual or projected CCO sales.
Mr. Patino concluded that in addition to the 357 wells that were drilled through
December 2008, an additional 754 new wells could be drilled at the Huyapari fields,
with varying initial production potential rates.1°'°

c. Initial potential production

1007 He however eliminated around 10 wells, which exhibited a decline rate of more than 30%. Thus, the sample
size is actually 55 wells.

668. Lastly, Mr. Patino determined the initial potential production of the wells at the
Huyapari field. His analysis revealed that they fell into three broad groups: “(i) the
2001-2009 wells were located in the best sands of the field, and therefore tended to
have the highest average initial potential production; (ii) the 2010-2013 wells had a
lower average initial potential production; and (iii) the remaining wells as of December
31, 2013 were projected to have an average initial potential production that was lower
still.""°'' As with the Petrozuata Project, Mr. Strickland does not dispute Mr. Patino’s
initial potential production calculations. 1012

Mr. Patino concludes that “from the inception of the Hamaca Project through [2037],
when its term would have expired under the Hamaca Association Agreement a total
of 1,269.8 million barrels of EHCO would be produced using cold production
techniques” with approx. 961 million barrels being produced starting 1 January
2009.1014

iii. The Tribunal’s determination

In light of the Parties’ above submissions, the Tribunal considers that with respect to
the production profiles proposed by each of the Parties, the following issues arise for
its consideration:

i. Which of the two competing production forecasts better reflects the production
volumes that could have been achieved but-for the Expropriaton?

ii. If the answer to the above is the Respondents production profile, then what
production volumes should be adopted for the period June 2007 to December
2008?

What production volumes should be adopted for the historical period i.e. 1
January 2009 — December 2015?

iv. What production volumes should be adopted for the projection period i.e. 1

January 2016 onwards?

a) What is the applicable decline rate for each of the Petrozuata and

Hamaca Projects?

b) What are the total number of additional wells that would have been
drilled at the Petrozuata and Hamaca Project and what would their

production have been?
(1) Which production forecast should be adopted?

As to this issue, the Tribunal is of the view that a post-Expropriation production profile
that takes into account actual production figures should be adopted in the instant

case.

675.

First, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondents that a date of award or ex post
valuation should take into account actual post-nationalization information about the
Projects, unless the Tribunal finds for any reason that such information is either
unreliable or has not been sufficiently proved. The Tribunal considers that in large oil
exploitation projects such as the present, there are likely to be several variables that
cannot be accounted for in any business projection and which would impact the
Project as a matter of course. As such, the Tribunal is unable to agree that the 2006
production figures are the best evidence of the Projects’ production capacity for the
next 20-30 years. Thus, generally, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimants’
reliance on pre-Expropriation forecasts to establish their production figures. However,
it remains to be seen whether any of the Claimants’ other objections are capable of
impugning the Respondents’ production forecasts. In particular, the Tribunal shall
assess whether the Claimants have demonstrated that the Projects performed less
profitably because of the Respondents.

In this respect, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants’ arguments do not withstand
scrutiny. Largely, the Claimants have once again sought to raise the specter of the
“new PDVSA” to challenge the trustworthiness of the Respondents’ forecasts.
However, as established elsewhere in this Award, there is no “new PDVSA’” any more
than there was an “old PDVSA”.°5 Namely that, as the Claimants themselves
recognize, PDVSA was and remains a wholly State-owned entity, which pursuant to
its By-laws is required to comply with and implement the policies and decision of the
Government.'°® The Claimants’ attempt to suggest that under the Chavez
administration, PDVSA acquired a new persona that had different and purportedly
non-commercial objectives is unsubstantiated. In fact, the Tribunal finds the argument
rather counter-intuitive. Indeed, if PDVSA’s objective was to be a “cash cow” and fund
the Government's various social programs as the Claimants allege, it would be
incentivized to maximize its profits from the Projects, as opposed to putting the very

source of its revenues into jeopardy.

Similarly, the argument that PDVSA suffered a loss of its oil intelligentsia is also far-
fetched. No doubt, several employees were dismissed in 2003. However, the Tribunal
finds it difficult to agree with the Claimants that the dismissal of these employees was
a cause for drop in production. It appears that from 2003 to 2007, the Projects
continued to function with PDVSA personnel and at no point during these years have

the Claimants complained of any incompetence on the part of such personnel

involved in the Projects.

As regards the Claimants’ reliance on the investigation carried out at the instruction of
the National Assembly of Venezuela and the findings made in the Report, the
Tribunal determines that these findings were not specific to any purported
transgression at either the Petrozuata or Hamaca Projects. In the circumstances, the
Tribunal cannot draw an adverse inference as to the reliability of the Respondents’

production figures.

Thus, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondents’ production profile, i.e. one which
takes into account actual volumes, should be adopted. However, the Tribunal notes
that the Claimants have raised several objections to various aspects of the
Respondents’ production profile and the methodology adopted by the Respondents’
experts in order to forecast production for the historical and projection periods. Thus,
if the Tribunal were to find that the Claimants’ arguments in this respect withstand
scrutiny, it would have to consider the implications thereof on the production figures
proposed by the Respondents.

Therefore, the Tribunal shall next consider these objections with a view to
determining whether the Respondents’ production figures can be adopted for each of

the historical and projection periods, namely:
a. The period from 26 June 2007 — December 2008;
b. The period from 1 January 2009 — December 2015;
c. The period from 1 January 2016 till the end of the term of each Project.

(2) Which production volumes should be adopted for the period 26 June 2007 —
December 2008?

With respect to the production volumes for the period June 2007 to December 2008,
the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have not raised any specific objections to the
actual volumes of EHCO proposed by Mr. Figuera in his testimony. Rather, the
general objections to adopting post-Expropriation figures apply in respect of this
period as well. Given that the Tribunal has already concluded that these objections do
not withstand scrutiny,’°"” the Tribunal is persuaded by the Respondents’ position and

1017 Supra, §§ 672-677.

274

thus finds that the actual production volumes for June 2007 to December 2008 as
proposed by the Respondents should be adopted.

 

(3) Which pr i I should be adopted for the ining historical
period?

680. For the remaining historical period, the Claimants object to the Respondents’
exclusion of approximately 97 million barrels of actually produced EHCO on the basis
that these volumes constituted non-upgraded and blended products that the
Associations were allegedly not permitted to produce.''® According to the Claimants,
such exclusion is worth approximately USD 7.5 billion.1°'°

681. Relying on the testimony of Mr. Figuera and two letters of 23 June 2005 from the then
Minister of Energy (one addressed to each Project),1°?° the Claimants argue that
there is no basis for excluding such additional volumes of EHCO because the pre-
Expropriation Projects produced and sold non-upgraded products.1921

682. Having examined Mr. Figuera’s testimony, as well as the 23 June 2005 letters to the
Projects, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Claimants’ arguments. It is not disputed
by the Respondents that, pre-Expropriation, the Projects produced and sold non-
upgraded products.'°?? However, as developed further below, this does not mean that
the Projects were entitled to legally characterize the sale of non-upgraded or blended
products as sales falling under the AAs.

683. In his testimony at the Hearing, Mr. Figuera confirmed that, although the Projects did
produce and commercialize non-upgraded products, they did so in very specific and
limited circumstances, namely (i) prior to the commissioning of the upgrader, i.e.
during the development or pre-operation phases of the Projects (which ended in April

governmental approval, during the upgraders’ maintenance turnaround periods.'°2°

684. The above is hardly surprising. Lacking a functioning upgrader, the need to produce
and sell non-upgraded and blended EHCO appears to be quite sensible. For
instance, the Hamaca AA notably provides that, before the completion of the
upgrader, the RNCF necessary to determine the MAE resulting from a DA must
consider a limited “Development Production” (i.e. non-upgraded EHCO).'°%4 Further,
the Claimants expressly requested authorization to the Ministry of Energy to produce
and commercialize non-upgraded blended crude during the turnaround periods.1°75

685. Aside from these two specific circumstances, neither of the Projects were authorized
to obtain revenues from the production and sale of non-upgraded and blended
EHCO. The June 2005 Ministry letters to the Projects were clear in this regard. In
relevant parts, the letter to the Hamaca Project states:1026

| hereby inform you that this Office has proceeded to review the terms of the
exploitation of the Orinoco Oil Belt’s extra-heavy crude, by [the Hamaca

Tenth Conditions, granted to thle Hamaca] Association the exploitation of the
reserves of extra-heavy crude and its upgrading, as well as the marketing
of the upgraded crude and the use, sale or distribution of all associated gas

Payment of the above mentioned royalty does not legitimize the excesses
identified and, accordingly, does not imply an authorization for the
indicated activities or created situations.

[Ll

According to the Claimants, the above letters were only a “tax bill” which recognized
and accepted that the Projects were producing non-upgraded products. In their view,
these letters implicitly recognize that the Projects could produce non-upgraded
products.

The Tribunal cannot follow the Claimants’ interpretation. While the two 23 June 2005
letters may be said to impose a “tax bill’, they certainly did not provide an
authorization or recognition of the Projects’ right to produce non-upgraded or blended
products. Importantly, the letters clearly recognize that the Congressional
Authorizations only authorized the Projects to exploit EHCO and to market upgraded
crude (i.e. CCO). Blending was only permitted in the pre-operating phases and not in
the subsequent exploitation phases. Additionally, the production volumes were limited
to 197,000 BPD of EHCO for the Hamaca Project and 120,000 BPD of EHCO for the
Petrozuata Project.

In light of these restrictions, the excess EHCO produced would not fall within the
ambit of either the PCA or the HCA and thus could not be considered as crude
produced pursuant to the rights under the AAs or subject to the fiscal regime
applicable to the AAs. To the contrary, it appears that the excess EHCO would be
subject to general applicable law and not subject to the special protection created by
the AAs. To paraphrase the language used in the 23 June 2005 letters, the
acknowledgment by Venezuela that there were excess EHCO volumes produced, did
“not legitimize the excesses .... [nor] imply an authorization for the indicated activities
or created situations” under the AAs.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Projects were only allowed to
produce a certain quantity of EHCO, which was then to be upgraded to CCO. Apart
from the development phase (which ended in 2004 at the latest), the Projects were
not allowed to produce excess volumes of EHCO or sell it in non-upgraded form. In
the event they did so, such EHCO cannot be considered as EHCO produced
pursuant to the AAs. Accordingly, even if the Projects indeed produced and sold
excess blended EHCO prior to the Expropriation, such production cannot be deemed
production under the AAs. As such, it cannot therefore contribute to the production

278

volumes under the AAs in a but-for application. This is particularly the case under the
Hamaca AA, which explicitly states that only the production volumes of upgraded
crude oil (i.e. CCO or “Commercial Production”) must be compensated to the
Claimants pursuant to DA provisions.'°78 Thus, in respect of the historical period, the
Tribunal considers it appropriate to adopt Mr. Patino’s estimates of EHCO volumes.

 

(4) What producti I should be yp for the proj period?

691. The Parties agree that the crux of the dispute concerning the projection period
pertains to the decline rate analysis.1029

692. In this regard, the Claimants object to the fact that Mr. Patino conflated exponential
and hyperbolic wells and applied the same exponential decline rate for forecasting
production from all wells. The Claimants’ expert, Mr. Strickland accounts for decline
rates of exponential and hyperbolic wells separately.

693. In light of the testimony of the Parties’ experts at the Hearing however, the Tribunal
finds the Claimants’ objection to the Respondents’ decline rate analysis overstated.
First, during the Hearing, the Claimants’ expert, Mr. Strickland admitted that if the
Tribunal were to apply his decline rates and the additional wells proposed by him (i.e.
22 for Petrozuata and 20 for Hamaca), the production volumes would increase by an
additional 18 million barrels for each Project.

Q. [...] if we include your additional 22 wells at Petrozuata, and the same thing
at Hamaca, with 20 wells, it's an additional 18 million barrels of production?

A. That's correct.

1028 R-PHB, § 812. The Tribunal notes that Mr. Manning recognized that the compensation formula of the Hamaca
AA is based exclusively on “Commercial Production”; Tr. (Day 2) 388:18 — 389:14 (Mr. Manning) (“Q. Well, let's
look at Article 14.2(f). Do you see that? A. Yes. Q. Okay. You see that formula? A. Uh-huh. Q. Is that what would
that apply? A. 14.2(f). Yes. Q. Okay. And you see a definition of SR? A. Yes. Qa. Okay. And that's--Development
Production we i a long time ag 2--was that of ‘heavy during that period.
Do you remember that? A. Mm-hmm. Q. Okay. We're not in that period right now. A. Right. Q. So, now we're
talking about Commercial Production. A. Okay. [...] Q. Right. So, you see the formula is based exclusively on
Commercial Production, isn't it? A. Well, we're past Development Production, so it has to be Commercial
Production”);

In turn, the Tribunal also notes that Mr. Heinrich conceded that the term “Commercial Production” means the
“production at the tail end of the upgrader’” (i.e. “upgraded crude oil”); Tr. (Day 2) 665:17 — 666:13 (Mr. Heinrich)
(“Q. Do you have any understanding of Section 14.2(f), 18 which is the basic Threshold Cash Flow formula and
19 Reference Cash Flow formula that your Planning Group was 20 undoubtedly modeling? A. Yes. Q. You do
have an understanding? A. Yes. Q. Okay. Do you have an understanding that SR, the first step in this formula, is,
at this point in time, based on--that's the revenue part--based on Commercial Production? You understand that;
right? A. Yes. Q. And you know what Commercial Production is A. Yes. Q. What is it? A. That's the production--at
the tail end of the upgrader. Q. So, it's upgraded crude oil; right? A. Yes.”)

1029 Tr, (Day 8), 2156:3-10 (Mr. Strickland) (Q: [...] And at the end of the day, the biggest difference between you
and Mr. Patifio is decline rate; right? A. That's correct. [...] [T]hat's half of it. Then the other half is the
methodology--well, | guess you could lump it all into decline rate).

 

279

Q. And all that is based upon your decline rates as opposed to Mr. Patifio's
decline rates?

A. [...] Yes.

Q. So, if Mr. Patifio's decline rates were to be accepted by the Tribunal and
applied to additional wells that they accepted from you, it would be less than 18
million barrels for each of those fields?

A. That's correct.1°9°

694. Moreover, Mr. Patino also assessed the production volumes on the basis of Mr.
Strickland’s approach and determined that the accumulated production for the life of
the Petrozuata Project would be only 13.8 million barrels higher than the production
obtained using a single exponential decline rate of 22% proposed by Mr. Patino. 1%
Similarly, with respect to the Hamaca Project, the accumulated production based on
Mr. Patino’s decline rate of 24% was in fact 1.8 million barrels more than the
production volumes arrived at on the basis of Mr. Strickland’s methodology.'°°* The
Tribunal finds that these figures are not drastically different such that they would call
into question the methodology followed by the Respondents and the productions

volumes which they propose for the projection period.

695. In these circumstances, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to adopt the Respondents’
production figures even for the future period.

696. All in all, the Tribunal finds that for both the Petrozuata and the Hamaca Projects, the

production volumes as modeled by the Respondents’ experts may be adopted.

1031 R-PHB, § 672.

1082 R-PHB, §§ 756; Tr. (Day 9), 2318:6-2319:14 (Mr. Patiio). At the Hearing, with reference to slides 35 and 36
of his presentation, Mr. Patifio explained as follows” “In this case, | addressed Dr. Strickland’s criticism that |
conflated exponential and hyperbolic decline rates with an additional analysis. First, | calculated equivalent
exponential decline rates for all the wells in my analysis that declined hyperbolically. Then, | averaged those
equivalent exponential decline rates with exponential decline rates and the result was 17.3 for Petrozuata and
18.7 for Hamaca, both exponentially. Finally, | applied this average to all the wells in my Production Capacity
Programs as | did in my initial analysis. Logically, this increased accumulated production; however, it also ignored
the fact that the wells drilled at the outset exhibit a more favorable decline behaviour and would not be
representative of the wells that would be subsequently drilled at the fields. For these reasons, | also carried out a
hybrid method. In this case, | applied the average | referred to above, 17.3 percent at Petrozuata and 18.7 at
Hamaca, to the wells that were in production as of January 2009. To new wells connected to production
thereafter, | applied the decline rate that | derived from my analysis of the wells that were connected to production
in 2009. And | estimated 25 percent at Petrozuata and 27.3 percent at Hamaca. As can be seen in this table, the
result of the hybrid methodology regarding accumulated production is basically the same to the one | obtained
using my original analysis, that is, using a single decline rate of 22 exponential at Petrozuata and 24 percent at
Hamaca. This exercise corrects the mistake indicated by Dr. Strickland, and these results confirm the rates that |
originally derived using my petroleum engineering judgment.”

280

b. Reserves figures

i. The Claimants’ position

697. It is the Claimants’ case that the reliability of their pre-Expropriation production
forecasts is corroborated by the Respondents’ own Proved Reserves figures for each
Project. The Claimants first explain that Proved Reserves figures constitute the most
important data for determining expected production volumes.'%° Adopting the
Respondents’ own definition of Proved Reserves, the Claimants submit that Proved
Reserves are “hydrocarbon volumes estimated with reasonable certainty and
recoverable from known oil fields according to the available geological and
engineering information and under prevailing operating and economic conditions and
government regulations”.'°*4 To put it simply, Proved Reserves are a measure of the
volume of oil that can be expected to be recovered with reasonable certainty [a
probability of 90% or higher] from specific oil fields under existing and known
geological and technical circumstances. 1035

698. In light of the above understanding, the Claimants contend that first, according to the
statistical data published by the Ministry, the Proved Reserves for the Petrozuata
Project (“Petrozuata Proved Reserves”) have been substantially increasing since
2006. In 2007, the Ministry reported the Petrozuata Proved Reserves to be 3.1 billion
barrels and as of 2010 the figure had increased to 3.9 billion barrels of EHCO.1%°
Both these figures are substantially higher than the oil volume proposed by Mr.
Abdala.

1083 Reserves are divided into 3 categories: Proved (1P), Proved plus Probable (2P), and Proved plus Probable
plus Possible (3P). Proved Reserves represent the estimate for “actual production” from a given field and hence,
by their nature are conservative figures. C-213.

1034 CLEX-91; According to the Claimants, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the OPEC (of which
Venezuela is a member) and the Respondents adopt functionally identical definitions of Proved Reserves.
Accordingly, the Claimants submit that the Proved Reserves reported by ConocoPhillips to the US SEC as part of
its regulatory obligations and those estimated by the Respondents are arrived at on the basis of a substantially
similar understanding and are therefore comparable for the purposes of validating the Claimants’ production
forecasts.

1035 C-PHB, § 633.

1086 €-221, C-295, CLEX-052. Second, DeGolyer and MacNaughton, an independent consulting firm, certified
Petrozuata’s Proved Reserves at 1.02 billion barrels of EHCO as of 31 December 2005. Using the 2005 D&M
reserves estimate, Abdala calculates implied year-end 2006 proved reserves by subtracting 2006 production from
the 2005 D&M reserves. Implied proved reserves as of year-end 2006 were 977 MMBO, which is higher than the
composite model's reserves (Abdala ER |, CER-3, § 161). Third, in accordance with their regulatory obligations,
ConocoPhillips reported Proved Reserves of 936.4 million barrels to the US SEC as at 31 December 2006.

281

699.

700.

701.

702.

703.

Similarly, the Proved Reserves for the Hamaca Project (“Hamaca Proved Reserves”)
have increased from 3.69 billion barrels in 2006, to 4.6 billion barrels as of 2015.19”
These figures are also evidently higher than the oil volume of 1.864 billion barrels
proposed by Mr. Abdala. Moreover, the Claimants submit that the forecast is also
consistent with the Reserves figures of 1.96 billion barrels as of year-end 2006,
reported by ConocoPhillips to the US SEC in 2007.18

On this basis, it is the Claimants’ case that the Respondents’ and the Ministry’s own
Proved Reserves figures undermine their allegations regarding the Hamaca and
Petrozuata Project’s post-Expropriation production prospects. Instead, these figures
confirm “with reasonable certainty” that there is sufficiently recoverable EHCO such
that the Claimants’ pre-Expropriation production forecast is accurate and achievable.

Turning to the Respondents’ arguments, the Claimants assert that the “Respondents’
attempts to undermine the critical significance of their own Reserves figures is

unavailing” .1°°9

As regards the Respondents’ contention that the Ministry's Proved Reserve figures
were for the life of the field and not the term of the Project, making them non-
comparable, the Claimants submit that the above distinction fails on the Ministry's
own definition of “Proved Reserves”.'°4° In particular, they assert that as per this
definition Proved Reserves are EHCO volumes that are virtually certain to be
recovered under “prevailing operational, economic and governmental regulatory
conditions”.'°41 According to the Claimants, this definition thus refers to volumes that
can be recovered now and signifies that there is more than sufficient oil in the fields to

satisfy the pre-Expropriation production forecasts.1042

As regards the Respondents’ contention that the Ministry and PDVSA’s Proved
Reserves figures include additional oil volumes that would be recoverable using
enhanced oil recovery (“EOR”) techniques, and therefore cannot be compared to the

1087 €-221, C-295, CLEX-052. Second, DeGolyer and MacNaughton, an independent consulting firm, certified
Petrozuata’s Proved Reserves at 1.02 billion barrels of EHCO as of 31 December 2005. Using the 2005 D&M
reserves estimate, Abdala calculates implied year-end 2006 proved reserves by subtracting 2006 production from
the 2005 D&M reserves. Implied proved reserves as of year-end 2006 were 977 MMBO, which is higher than the
composite model's reserves (Abdala ER |, CER-3, § 161). Third, in accordance with their regulatory obligations,
ConocoPhillips reported Proved Reserves of 936.4 million barrels to the US SEC as at 31 December 2006.

volumes extracted using only cold production or primary extraction techniques which
form the basis of the Claimants’ calculation,’°“? the Claimants assert that this
distinction is baseless and irrelevant.'°4

They contend that the distinction is baseless because if EOR was being implemented
at the present time (i.e. in the post-Expropriation actual world); then it would have
also been implemented in the but-for world. Moreover, they assert that if the Projects
had not been expropriated, the Claimants themselves would have promoted the use
of EOR techniques and increased production.1%5

ji. The Respondents’ position

According to the Respondents, the Claimants are in fundamental error when they rely
on the Ministry and PDVSA’s Proved Reserve figures to support their pre-
Expropriation production profiles for the Hamaca and Petrozuata Projects.

The Respondents assert that the Ministry's Proved Reserves figures project
production over the entire life of the field and using all viable extraction techniques,
namely i.e. cold production as well EOR techniques. By contrast, the Claimants’
calculations are based on the production over the life of the Project using only cold
production techniques.'°* The Respondents submit that consequently the two are not
comparable and the Ministry's figures will always be higher.1°7

Mr. Figuera explains that:

the Ministry-approved reserves are for the life of the field, not the life of the
Project. They therefore assume that over a long period of time, well past the
termination date of a project, the well will continue to produce oil, even at lower
and lower rates, until an assumed recovery factor is achieved. In addition, the
Ministry-approved reserves assume that additional wells that are economically
attractive to the country will be drilled in due time, even though those wells

1043 Figuera, WS |, RWS-2, fn. 20 (“Steam-enhanced production techniques (or thermal techniques) are also
referred to as secondary recovery or enhanced oil recovery ("EOR”) techniques. They are to be distinguished
from “cold production” or primary recovery techniques. In the case of the latter, production depends on the field's
own energy, which dissipates over time. In the case of the former, steam is injected in the field to create energy,
reduce viscosity and generate a higher recovery factor (i.e., the recovery of a higher percentage of the field’s
original oil in place [...]) over time. As discussed in my ICSID Testimonies, drilling and fitting wells for eventual
use in a steam-enhanced EOR program is more expensive than drilling cold production wells. The capital and
operating costs associated with a steam-enhanced EOR project — which includes steam-generating facilities and
water removal and treatment facilities — are also significantly higher than those for a cold production project. See
Annex A, First ICSID Testimony, n. 11; Annex B, Second ICSID Testimony, {| 27; Annex D, Fourth ICSID
Testimony, {| 52 and nn. 171, 202; Annex E, Fifth ICSID Testimony, {| 17”).

would not be economically attractive to a project with a finite life. Finally,
ministry approved reserves now also include production based on the
assumption that EOR techniques ultimately will be employed over the life of the
field. Once again, such methods of production, which may be unattractive
economically for a foreign investor in a project with a finite term, would be
attractive to the country in the long run.1048

The Respondents assert that Mr. Figuera’s above testimony has gone

uncontested.149

To Mr. Figuera’s above testimony, the Respondents’ expert Mr. Patifio adds that the
increase in the Ministry’s Reserves figures post-Expropriation, was due to “the use of
secondary recovery techniques”:'°©° From 2009, Ministry Reserves for the Petrozuata
field included expected production from EOR, while for the Hamaca field this revision
was added from 2010 onwards.1°5"

In response to the Claimants’ argument that the distinction between the Projects’
Reserves and the fields’ Reserves is illusory and meaningless as it contradicts the
definition of “Proved Reserves’, the Respondents assert that “Reserves volumes
calculated over some period of time, whether it is for thirty years, covering the term of
a project, or one hundred years, covering the life of a field, cannot be recovered
“now”; they can only be recovered over time, as the implementation of a development
programme at a field (with or without EOR) cannot be achieved all at once.”1052

Finally, the Respondents assert that it is no argument to say that the Claimants too
could have implemented EOR techniques and increased production had they
remained participants in the Project, inasmuch as such techniques were never
seriously considered for the Hamaca Project and were rejected as uneconomical for
the Petrozuata Project.’ In this respect, the Respondents assert that an EOR
project was determined to be cost prohibitive in 2005, when its use was first
suggested by the Claimants, in light of the existing tax regime and the fact that the
Claimants would have to pay for the natural gas to generate the steam required. The
Respondents therefore conclude that if the EOR project was not economic in 2005

under the fiscal regime existing at the time, it is unlikely to have been economical in
the post-Expropriation period given the increase in the tax and royalty rates. 1054

In sum, the Respondents conclude that the Claimants’ argument that the increase in
the Proved Reserves figures reported by the Ministry and PDVSA for the Petrozuata
and Hamaca fields since the nationalization “demolishes Respondents’ production

estimates”'5° as frivolous: 1°

there is no connection between the Ministry reserves, which include oil that will
be produced in the very long term using all available techniques with a recovery
factor of 20%, and the production volumes that can be achieved using only cold
production during the terms of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects. While
Claimants’ desire to avoid the pre-nationalization evidence demonstrating that
the production profiles they hoped to achieve at the outset of the Projects was
unrealistic under cold production is understandable, their reliance on Ministry
Reserves is nothing more than a smokescreen.1°57

iii. The Tribunal’s determination

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that the reliance on Proved Reserves is only to
corroborate the Claimants’ production profile and call into question the purportedly
low production profile proposed by the Respondents. In this respect, the Tribunal has
already concluded that of the two, it is adopting the Respondents’ production profile.

In any event, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Claimants’ arguments on this issue.
This is because as the Respondents rightly point out, the Claimants are in effect
“comparing apples to oranges”.

The Tribunal notes that regardless of the period of time the Proved Reserves figures
covered (i.e. the life of the field as argued by the Respondents or the life of the
Project as argued by the Claimants), the real issue is whether the volumes indicated
in the Proved Reserves figures could have been achieved through the cold
production techniques used by the Projects or whether it required EOR techniques.
Assuming that the figures could only have been achieved using EOR techniques, the
second stage of the inquiry is whether the Claimants would have implemented such
EOR techniques.

719.

As regards the first issue highlighted above, it is common ground that the Ministry's
Proved Reserves figures included volumes based on the implementation of EOR
techniques from 2009 onwards for the Petrozuata Project and from 2010 onwards for
the Hamaca Project.'°5° Moreover, the Claimants have not sought to argue that the
Proved Reserves figures could have been achieved through the implementation of
only cold production techniques.1°°° Thus, arguably the upward trend in the Ministry's
Proved Reserves figures is due to the proposed implementation of EOR techniques.

This takes the Tribunal to the following question: given that EOR was in fact
contemplated, have the Claimants demonstrated that they too would have
implemented EOR but-for the Expropriation. In this regard, the Claimants’ witness Mr.
Brown stated that “ConocoPhillips — a world leader in an EOR method known as
Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) — would have promoted the use of EOR
had the Projects not been confiscated”.'°® The Tribunal finds that the Claimants’
statement has not been substantiated in any manner. The Claimants have failed to
present any evidence to show that they would have considered EOR economically
viable and implemented it in order to achieve their pre-Expropriation production
profiles. In these circumstances, the Claimants’ argument comes across as
unconvincing and does not provide a sufficient basis for calling into question the
Respondents’ production figures.

Production issues specific to the Petrozuata Project

Turning to issues specific to the Petrozuata Project, the Respondents raise certain
upstream and downstream issues which in their view affect the production forecast for
the Petrozuata Project. The Tribunal will first set out the Parties’ positions, before
setting out its determination with respect to each issue. Giving that the Respondents
raised the issues, the Tribunal will set out the Respondents’ arguments first.

i. The Respondents’ position

The Respondents raise the following issues in respect of the production forecast of
the Petrozuata Project, each of which shall be elaborated upon in turn:

(1) The alleged pre-Expropriation downward trend in production;

1058 Brown WS 1, CWS-8, § 70; R-PHB, § 690.
1059 C-PHB, §§ 646 et. seq.

723.

(2) The alleged issues with the upgrader.
(1) The alleged downward trend in production

The Respondents’ witness, Mr. Figuera argues that there was a downward trend in
production at the Petrozuata Project even prior to the Expropriation in 2007 and this
trend would likely have continued thereafter. Mr. Figuera explains that at the time of
its authorization, the Petrozuata Project was allotted two designated areas from which
EHCO could be extracted. A “Base Area” of 231 km? and a “Reserve Area”
aggregating 69 km?. The Project was supposed to be developed from the Base Area
and the Reserve Area was to be utilized only if the Project partners agreed and if
authorization to do so was received from the Ministry.1°

Mr. Figuera contends that at the outset, it was believed that the Project would achieve
production of an average 120,000 BPD for the entire term of the AA with a total of
only 571 single lateral wells [which were expected to initially produce 1,500 BPD
with relatively long plateau periods'°*"] using cold production techniques.’ This
approach was allegedly premised on the understanding that the oil in the Petrozuata
fields was easy to extract and that its geological properties would not hamper such
extraction.

The Respondents assert however that the reservoir/field was complex and its
geological properties resulted in much lower initial productions rates, lower plateau
periods and higher decline rates than originally anticipated.1°°* As a consequence the
Petrozuata Project re-evaluated its drilling programme and in order to achieve
aggregate production of 1.56 billion barrels of EHCO over the term of the Project,
envisaged the construction of approx. 754 multilateral wells i.e., wells with a number
of branches (or “laterals”) that could drain different parts of the reservoir

simultaneously.

Mr. Figuera states that the multilateral well-drilling programme only achieved short
term success. Although it helped the Project achieve the production targets
necessary to satisfy the lenders, it was not a long-term solution that addressed the
production problems plaguing the Petrozuata Project. According to Mr. Figuera, the

1061 Figuera, WS |, RWS-2, § 18.

1062 The plateau period is the period during which the well produces at an optimal, stable level before production
decline commences. Figuera, WS 1, RWS-2, fn 25.

1063 Figuera, WS |, RWS-2, Annex D, § 52 and fns. 171, 202 (Figuera Fourth ICSID Testimony).
1064 Figuera, WS |, RWS-2, §§ 19-20.

287

fact that this was not a long-term or feasible solution is borne out by the business
plans for the Petrozuata Project, which kept envisaging the drilling of an increased
number of wells. In particular:

(a) The 2002 business plan contemplated production of approx. 1.59 billion
barrels of EHCO at the rate of 120,000 BPD through 2036. The plan
envisaged the drilling of 745 wells in total, with no new wells being required
until mid 2003.

(b) However, the 2003 business plan, which was issued 6 months later, allegedly
envisaged the drilling of additional wells in the first quarter of 2003 itself, in
order to meet the projected total production of 1.6 billion barrels of EHCO
through 2035, at 120,785 BPD. According to Mr. Figuera the acceleration in
the drilling programme indicates that the field was declining at a faster rate
than expected. Also in 2003, it appears that the Projects’ reservoir personnel
stated that access to the Reserve Area would be required in the near term if
the production rate of 120,000 BPD had to be achieved for the life of the
Project.106

(c) The 2004 business plan projected total EHCO production of 1.58 billion
barrels at the rate of 120,000 BPD through to 2033, after which production
would decline. However, the plan projected a total of 777 wells, or 29 more
than the 2003 business plan.1°66

(d) The 2005 business plan projected total EHCO production of 1.56 billion
barrels over the term of the Project at the rate of 131,100 BPD in normal
years. However, it appears that the decline would start much earlier in 2029.
The Respondents also emphasize that the plan envisaged the drilling of 56
new wells over a 5-year period to support the above production levels.'°°”

(e) The draft 2006 business plan projected total EHCO production of 1.502 billion
barrels at 118,200 BPD in normal years. Decline was estimated to start in
2031. To meet this target, the drilling of allegedly 83 new wells between 2005-

1065 CER-3, CLEX-63. See also Figuera WS |, RWS-2, App 15 (2003 Petrozuata Business Plan). The 2003
Business Plan envisages the drilling of 748 wells over the life of the Project.

1066 ©.402

1087 €-104. However, the Tribunal notes that the total well count reflected in this Business Plan is 727 wells for the
life of the Project, which is a drop in the number of wells by 50, from the last Business Plan.

288

726.

2009 was contemplated i.e. more than the 56 wells envisaged in the 2005

business plan.1°®

S

Finally, in the same year, the Respondents assert that in a presentation made
by ConocoPhillips, they deflated the above figures. The Claimants predicted a
total production of 1.246 billion barrels of EHCO over the life of the Project at
118,200 BPD. Moreover, the production was predicted to start declining as
early as 2023. Also, the presentation allegedly envisaged the need to drill 116-
119 more wells between 2005-2009. 109

According to Mr. Figuera, the above numbers clearly indicate that the situation at the
Petrozuata Project had changed dramatically year-on-year. Moreover, the
precariousness of the production situation just prior to the 2007 Nationalization was
obvious. In sum, according to the Respondents, the above figures demonstrate that
the Petrozuata production forecast were not set in stone and the 2006 production
profile is not reliable.

(2) Alleged issues with the upgrader

The Respondents’ witness, Mr. Figuera challenges the Claimants’ assumption that
the upgrader at the Petrozuata Project operated with no problems whatsoever, such
that the only limitation to its functioning was the amount of EHCO being extracted
from the field. Mr. Figuera asserts that if the Claimants’ production figures are
adopted, this assumption is possibly accurate because the Claimants assume that
production would never exceed 120,000 BPD i.e. more than the maximum capacity of
the upgrader. Therefore, at any point in time, the upgrader would always have excess
capacity available.1°7°

However, according to Mr. Figuera, this assumption does not hold good if actual post-
Expropriation data is taken into account, as is the Respondents case. Mr. Figuera
states that in the post-Expropriation period, “the upgrader experienced significant
periods of downtime [in 2010, 2011 and 2013] resulting from equipment failures and
operational errors” such that it placed a constraint on the production of CCO.1°7" In

1068 €-126. The total number of wells envisaged for the life of the Project was 746, i.e. 1 more than the number
contemplated in 2002. Moreover, this number is not much lesser than the total number of wells predicted by Mr.
Patifio for the Petrozuata Project as part of his decline rate analysis.

1071 Figuera, WS |, RWS-2, § 31, Annex D, §§ 87-95 (Mr. Figuera describes issues that arose with the upgrader
prior to December 31, 2013. Also, in 2014 and 2015, additional problems have allegedly arisen at the upgrader.

289

particular, the upgrader allegedly suffered from the following problems: (a) a number

of boiler failures, which reduced or eliminated the production of steam required in the

process; (b) a number of failures at the air compressors, which reduced or eliminated

compressed air required for, inter alia, the pneumatic actuators for the automatic

valves; (c) a failure at the atmospheric tower in 2010 due to the presence of

excessive water, resulting in damage to a number of the trays; and (d) a failure at the
DCuU.1972

727. Mr. Figuera explains each of the above in greater detail as follows:'°”

He states that at Petrozuata, steam is required for the proper functioning of
critical processes. Such steam is produced at the Steam Unit which comprises
three boilers. As per the original operating design, it was intended that two
boilers would function while the third would be kept on standby for
emergencies. However, it appears that early in the Project — which Mr.
Figuera specifies was prior to the migration — it was decided that all three
boilers would operate simultaneously at 50% of their capacities, such that if
one failed, the other two would already be operating. It appears that in 2005
one of the boilers failed and has only operated intermittently since then,

leaving the upgrader with only two functioning boilers.

Further, these boilers require fuel gas to operate, which provides the heat
necessary to convert water to steam. The fuel gas is generated in the
upgrading process but needs to be purified of its high concentration of
corrosive Hydrogen Sulphide gas. Such purification is achieved in the Amine
unit. However, in the event the Amine unit underperforms, the Hydrogen
Sulphide gas and its equally corrosive byproducts (i.e. sulphuric acid) remain
in the fuel gas and causes corrosion of the boilers’ tubes and chambers.
According to Mr. Figuera, while corrosion takes place even during the normal
operations of the boilers, it is even more acute when the boilers are shut

down.

In addition to the above acid corrosion, the boilers also face issues due to the
presence of hydrocarbons in the “boiler feed water that flows through the

 

During 2015, the upgrader experienced significant unscheduled shutdowns that the Project attributes in part to the
deferral of the turnaround that had been scheduled for mid-2015.)

1072 Figuera, WS |, RWS-2, Annex D, § 88. Mr. Figuera also asserts that there was a planned shutdown for a 67-
day turnaround in 2011.

728.

vi.

tubes”. Mr. Figuera asserts that while hydrocarbons can enter the steam
system, there are usually valves that should prevent such entry. However, the
valves installed at the Petrozuata upgrader were simple “check valves” that on
occasion did not respond fast enough to prevent the entry of hydrocarbons
into the steam system. Mr. Figuera states that such hydrocarbon laden water,
when heated in the boilers generates coke which builds up into the walls of
the tubes and can result in them fracturing. It appears that starting in
December 2009 and into 2011, there were a number of tube failures at the
boilers resulting from high Hydrogen Sulphide concentration in the fuel gas
and presence of hydrocarbons in the steam that resulted in partial and total
shutdowns of the upgrader, thereby affecting upgrader performance. As a
result of these issues, PDVSA was allegedly contemplating replacing various
parts of the upgrader with better systems/technology.

In 2010 and 2011, there were allegedly a number of failures at the air
compression units that caused unplanned shutdowns. Such shutdowns
occurred as a result excessive calcium carborate deposits in the compressor’s
tubes which then had a cascading effect on various parts of the compression

units.

In 2010 there was an emergency shutdown at the feed furnace due to the loss
of flow caused because of an obstruction in the filters. After the column was
restarted, certain problems still remained. In the process of fixing these
issues, those operating the upgrader caused damage to other parts of the
atmospheric column as a result of which the same was out of service for 28
days until repairs were completed.

Lastly, in 2013 there was an incident at the coker unit due to operator error
that caused a shutdown of the upgrader for 45 days.

On the basis of the above, Mr. Figuera asserts that even if the field produced excess

EHCO, due to the problems at the upgrader, not all of it was converted to CCO which

could be commercialized. Accordingly, he asserts that reductions in the production

figures on account of the problems at the upgrader need to be factored into

732.

Petrozuata’s production profile and this has been done by Mr. Patifio in his

analysis. 1074

ji. The Claimants’ position
The Claimants’ responses to each of the issues raised above are set out below:
(1) The alleged downward trend in production

The Claimants submit that the Respondents arguments as regards the alleged
downward trend in Petrozuata’s pre-Expropriation production profile are misleading.

First and foremost, the Claimants submit that Mr. Figuera, who now impugns these
production figures — endorsed them contemporaneously. For instance, Mr. Figuera
allegedly signed the 2005 Annual Report in his capacity as the President of
Petrozuata Project's operating company i.e. Petrozuata C.A. and therein endorsed
that the Project would produce over 1.6 billion barrels of EHCO over its operating
life.°’5 Further, in a presentation given in November 2006, Mr. Figuera allegedly
projected the recovery of 1.56 billion barrels of EHCO over the life of the Project and
the drilling of around 727 wells.'°’6 According to the Claimants, this figure significantly
exceeds the total recovery assumed by Mr. Abdala.

As regards the alleged increase in well count over the years, the Claimants submit
that the Respondents comparison is misleading in as much as it only reflects the
number of wells that were proposed to be drilled between 2005 and 2009 and fails to
give the total well count predicted in each business plan. Comparing the total well
count in each of the business plans, the Claimants assert that if the total well count
between the 2002 business plan and the 2006 business plan were to be compared,
the total number of wells increased only by 1 i.e. from 745 to 746. As regards the
Respondents’ reference to their October 2006 presentation, they assert that the
change in figures has occurred due to the deferral in access to the Reserve Area
from 2007 to 2009.1°77

(2) Alleged issues with the upgrader

1074 He also caveats that EHCO itself could not have been sold because the AAs in their original forms were not
allowed to sell blended products but only CCO. Hence, in the but for world, if actual figures are used, then the
actual CCO volumes that are sold must be used. Figuera, WS |, RWS-2, § 31; Figuera, WS |, RWS-2, Annex D, §
96.

292

733.

734,

735.

736.

737.

The Claimants submit that the Respondents’ arguments regarding alleged problems
with the upgrader have been conjured up for the sole purpose of reducing the
Claimants’ damages and are entirely meritless.

First, the Claimants submit that the Respondents’ allegations regarding the upgrader
rest solely on the testimony of Mr. Figuera who had no direct involvement with the
Petrozuata Project since November 2006. Accordingly, the Claimants submit that Mr.
Figuera’s testimony cannot support the Respondents’ allegations regarding problems
at the upgrader.

Second, the Claimants assert that prior to the Expropriation, the Petrozuata upgrader
enjoyed an exemplary operating record and had achieved an average on-stream
factor (“OSF”) of roughly 97%.'°8 The Claimants point out that with one notable
exception, all the problems highlighted by Mr. Figuera have occurred in 2009 or
thereafter, i.e. in the post-Expropriation period when the upgrader was operated
entirely by PDVSA. In the circumstances, the Claimants assert that any deficiencies
and problems at the upgrader reflect PDVSA’s own negligent operation of the
upgrader and cannot be attributed to the Claimants in the but-for analysis.

On this basis, the Claimants assert that, “the simple truth is that Respondents took
possession of an upgrader at Petrozuata that had attained “world class” status. To
the extent that any claims of diminished performance since the expropriation can be
credited, it is clear that the Respondents have only themselves to blame”.1°79

iii. The Tribunal’s determination

In respect of the first issue raised by the Respondents i.e. the alleged downward
trend in Petrozuata’ pre-Expropriation production figures, the Tribunal notes that the
Respondents’ objective behind making this argument was to call into question the
Claimants’ pre-Expropriation production forecasts. In light of the fact that the Tribunal
has decided to adopt the Respondents’ production forecasts, the Tribunal need not
reach any final decision on this argument.

1078 C-PHB, §§ 738-739. The Claimants explain that on-stream factor or OSF is a metric that describes the
operational efficiency of an upgrader or refinery. Simply put, it reflects the ratio of actual CCO production to the
upgrader’s capacity. For example, if an upgrader which has a capacity to convert 100,000 BPD actually produces
an average of 95,000 BPD of CCO over a given period of time, its OSF will be 95%. Earnest Report, § 50; Tr.
(Day 8) 2217:8-22 (Mr. Earnest). The Respondents’ witness also agrees with this definition. Figuera, WS |, RWS-
2, fn 83 (OSF in this context is expressed as a percentage equal to the total CCO produced during a period of
time divided by the design capacity of the upgrader).

1079 C-PHB, § 748.

293

738.

739.

740.

741.

As regards the second issue i.e. the alleged problems at the Petrozuata upgrader,
even in this case the Respondents appear to be raising this issue with the objective of
demonstrating that the assumptions underlying the Claimants’ production forecast are
incorrect. In particular, the Respondents seek to assert that not only the production
capacity of the field, but also the production capacity of the Petrozuata upgrader
acted as a constraint on production.'°®° In their view, the Claimants ignore both these
factors. First, as with their previous argument, the Tribunal need not reach a final
decision on this issue in light of the fact that it has decided to adopt the Respondents’
production forecasts. That said, the Tribunal finds the Respondents allegations
regarding the Petrozuata upgrader entirely without merit. The Tribunal notes that the
Respondents rely on the testimony of Mr. Figuera in support of their allegations
regarding the Petrozuata upgrader. Moreover, they state that “the Claimants have
previously been provided with documentation relating to a number of the more
serious problems at the Petrozuata upgrader in the post-nationalization period”.1°°"

However, having examined the documents on record, the Tribunal finds that the
Respondents have failed to produce any such “documentation” relating to the
“serious problems at the Petrozuata upgrader”.'°®? The only basis for their allegations
is Mr. Figuera’s unsubstantiated testimony. In the absence of such evidence, the
Tribunal finds the Respondents’ allegation regarding the upgrader’s role in any
perceived reduction in production volumes at the Petrozuata Project are untenable.

Production issues specific to the Hamaca Project

As with the Petrozuata Project, the Respondents raise certain downstream issues
which in their view affect the production forecast for the Hamaca Project. Even in this
instance, the Tribunal finds it apposite to set out the Respondents’ arguments first,
given that the Respondents have raised these issues.

i. The Respondents’ position

With respect to the Hamaca Project, the Respondents raise the following issues,
each of which shall be elaborated upon in turn:

1080 SoD, § 416
1081 See SoD, fn 945.

1082 When stating that they have provided the Claimants with necessary documentation, the Respondents only
refer to §§ 87-96 of Mr. Figuera’s Fourth ICSID Testimony (Figuera, WS |, RWS-2, Annex D, §§ 87-96) However,
in these paragraphs, Mr. Figuera only describes the alleged myriad problems at the Petrozuata upgrader without
referring to a single document in support of the same.

(1) The Hamaca upgrader’s On-Stream Factor (“OSF”);
(2) Issues faced by the Coker unit; and
(3) Other operational issues

(1) The Hamaca upgrader’s OSF

As explained previously, the OSF or on-stream factor is a measure of the total CCO
produced during a period of time divided by the design capacity of the upgrader.'°°9 In
other words it is reflective of the performance capacity or utilization of the upgrader.
Based on actual data, the Respondents propose a long-term OSF of 72.85% for the
Hamaca upgrader. In contrast, the Claimants propose an OSF factor of 91%. It is the
Respondents’ case that the 91% OSF underlying the Claimants’ production forecasts
for the Hamaca Project is absolutely unachievable given the condition of the Hamaca

upgrader and thus, entirely without basis.

The Respondents’ witness, Mr. Figuera, states that between 1999 and 2006 the
Hamaca Project participants commissioned four reliability, availability and
maintainability (“RAM”) studies to be undertaken by independent analysts, in order to
assess the upgrader’s performance.'°*4 Each RAM study was undertaken at different
stages of the construction process of the upgrader and therefore was able assess
additional technical information about the upgrader’s performance. According to Mr.
Figuera, “[t]he history of the RAM reports [...] shows that as the upgrader proceeded
from conceptual design to operation, its reliability, as measured by its predicted OSF,

deteriorated significantly”.

The findings of the four RAM studies are summarized below: 10°

(i) the projected OSF steadily declined as more information became available;
(ii) the probability analyses for RAMs Il, Ill and IV all indicate no chance of
achieving either the 93% long-term OSF target established at the beginning of
the Project or the 91% plus long-term OSF that forms the basis of Claimants’
projections; and (iii) the OSFs for the most representative scenario established

in RAM IV were 84.38%

before metallurgical improvements and 86.32%

following those improvements, reduced to 82.35% and 84.26% respectively,
when potential upstream failures are taken into account.'°87

746. To this, Mr. Figuera adds that with the exception of 2005 when the upgrader was
brand new, the OSF has never even reached the level predicted in the RAM studies,
much less a value of 91%. The actual performance of the upgrader and the OSF

achieved year-on-year is summarized below:

(Based on (Based on

747. Accordingly, it is the Respondents’ case that the upgrader could have never achieved
the 91% OSF adopted by the Claimants.

748. In response to the Claimants’ various allegations, the Respondents submit that:

a. The Claimants’ allegation that the RAM reports “predict an average long-term
OSF of between 84% and 93%”,'% is misleading. They submit that these
numbers are not indicative of a range of OSFs that can be achieved as sought

1087 R-PHB, § 706.
1088 Reply, § 405.

296

to be implied by the Claimants. Rather, they show a progressive downward
trend in the OSF as more information about the upgrader became available.
The Respondents assert that with the exception of RAM I, none of the other
RAM studies predict a maximum OSF which exceeds 88.38% and this number
is still lesser than the OSF value on which the Claimants seek to rely.1°8°

The Claimants assertion that the Board of Directors of the Hamaca Project
endorsed a long-term OSF of 91% at a Board Meeting of 18 May 2006 is
entirely misleading and incorrect. In this regard, the Respondents first assert
that the Claimants have relied on the presentation made at a different Board
Meeting i.e. the Board Meeting of 17 November 2005, and that this
presentation was never discussed at the 18 May Board Meeting. Second, they
assert that the Claimants have produced an incomplete translation of the
minutes alleging that the Spanish original is illegible, when in fact it is not.1°°°
The Respondents submit that the two phrases in the original Spanish version
of the Board Minutes which the Claimants purport are illegible in fact read as
follows: “el Plan General de Negocios establece un factor de utilizacién de
91,4% [...] pero se indicé que seria un reto para Ameriven durante los
proximos afios satisfacer esa expectativa. [...JEl Factor de Utilizacion del
Mejorador para el periodo de los proximos 10 afios es 91,4%, en relacion con
este asunto Ameriven mencioné que tenian que resolver como alcanzarian
este numero, sino el Plan de Negocios necesitaria una revision’. When
translated to English, according to the Respondents they state that achieving
a 91% OSF “would be a challenge for Ameriven during the next few years
[and that the Project] needed to figure out how they would reach this number,
otherwise the Business Plan would need to be revised.”°' In sum, the
Respondents assert that the Board minutes directly contradict the Claimants’

case.

The Claimants’ contention that the post-Expropriation performance of the
upgrader should be rejected in light of the fact that during this period the
upgrader was under the direction of a PDVSA controlled mixed enterprise,
ignores the distinction between “hopes and reality’.1°? In that, while the

Claimants may have “hoped” that the upgrader’s performance could have
been improved, this has no bearing on the “reality” that the upgrader’s
performance would have been no different even if the Claimants had
remained participants in the Hamaca Project. The performance of the
upgrader that was actually achieved and on which the Respondents rely, in
their view represents the performance that would in all likelihood have been
achieved, regardless of the presence of the Claimants.1°%

d. The Claimants’ contention that the OSF should be higher than 72.85% in light
of the billions of dollars spent by the Respondents on upgrader turnarounds
and improvements is confusing because it once again conflates hopes and
reality. The reality is that the OSF has averaged at 72.85% for eleven years of
operation through 2015. The reality also is that PDVSA and Chevron have
spent “hundreds of millions of dollars in an effort to improve upgrader
performance”.'° The reality equally is however that the expenditures have
not yielded sustained results. The attempt by the Claimants’ witness Mr.
Earnest, to predict an increased OSF based on the various maintenance and
improvement projects that were envisaged for the Hamaca Project ignores this
reality.10%

In sum, the Respondents conclude that, “the figures do not lie, and the 72.85% OSF
[posited by the Respondents] is supported by the entire record in these proceedings.
While the Claimants would like to believe that a project in which ConocoPhillips,
along with Chevron and PDVSA, was a partner would have performed better, there is
no basis whatsoever for the assertion that the “but for” world would have been any
brighter for the Hamaca upgrader.”109°

(2) Issues faced at the Coker unit

In addition to the aforesaid problems with the Hamaca upgrader’s OSF, Mr. Figuera
asserts that the upgrader also suffers from serious vibration problem at its coking
structure. It appears that in February 2006, “[alll parties agree[d] the problem is very
complex and not easy to solve. [...] Of particular concern has been the fact that the
vibrations cause[d] cracks in the coke drum overhead vapour lines that carry the

754.

entire content of the high-temperature, highly combustible effluent of the delayed
coking reaction process.”'°87 The Respondents submit that while short term and low
level usage may not create a high risk, regular usage could result in “a leak or failure
in these [vapour] lines [and would] have catastrophic consequences for the continued
viability of the upgrader”'°% as it would require the total shutdown of the upgrader for
an extended period of time.1°%?

According to the Respondents, the foregoing problems led to an enormous number of
loss of opportunity events over the life of the Project.'1° For example between 2005
and 2013 alone, the average number of loss of opportunity events was 40.8. The
overall loss of production was 5,258,000 barrels between 2005-2006 and 7,063,000
barrels between 2008-2013.

Further, the Respondents submit that they made every effort to find a solution to the
above vibration problem. In particular, Mr. Figuera asserts that:

The severity and uniqueness of the vibration problem resulted in the
establishment by the Project of a Vibration Mitigation Management Team prior
to the nationalization. This team was comprised of experts from each of the
Project participants, and headed up by personnel from Chevron Energy
Technology Company (“CETC”). Claimants have argued in the past that this
team came up with a solution. [...] Despite the efforts of CETC to develop a
solution, the best that its most recent proposed mitigation project is expected to
achieve is a reduction of the vibrations from eight times the target level to three
times the target level. In other words, even after all of the time and effort that
has gone into the study and analysis of the vibration problem, no real solution
has been developed for this unique problem, and the Project remains at
extreme risk.1101

Thus, the Respondents submit that the problems with the coker unit were of sufficient
magnitude to affect the upgrader’s performance for an extended period and create
the risk of catastrophic failure. In their view, the same should be accounted for in the
assessment of the Claimants damages.

Accordingly, to account for “a total shutdown of the upgrader, which would effectively
end the [Hamaca] Project,” the Respondents experts, Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores,

therefore not otherwise already included in the expected levels of CCO production and sales.

“assume in each year a 90% probability that the Hamaca upgrader will keep
operating and a 10% probability that the Hamaca upgrader will stop operating and
that, consequently, the Hamaca Project will cease operations”.'"°? They acknowledge
however that this issue has relatively little impact on their compensation calculations
in light of the Hamaca Project’s costs and oil price projections.

(3) Other operational issues

755. In addition to the above issues the Respondents assert that the following issues also
had an impact on production:

Corrosion: Claimants say that corrosion “was a recognized issue prior to the
expropriation and was being addressed” and that it “is a common problem at
refineries and has straightforward remedies.” The answer to Claimants’ first
point is that recognition of a problem and its favorable resolution are two very
different things. [...] [With the exception of the work of a Chevron (CVX) team
to “[update] corrosion assessment of plant” and initiate the “[a]pplication of
specialized techniques for early detection of corrosion mechanisms,” the only
thing that had been done was to place a purchase order for heat exchangers
with upgraded metallurgy, equipment that had been identified much earlier as
requiring upgrades. What is clear is that, while the Project recognized the
problem and had identified certain corrective measures, neither the scope nor
the estimated expenditures bore any relationship to reality. Claimants’ second
point — that refineries everywhere confront corrosion problems and such
problems can be remedied — is meaningless in the context of this case, where
PetroPiar implemented the metallurgy upgrades that were thought to be the
remedy prior to the nationalization, where the Chevron team responsible for
corrosion assessment has continued to find corrosion [in places] where it was
not expected to occur and new corrosive mechanisms, such as chlorine
corrosion, in still additional circuits, and where the problem has remained a
complex, moving target.

Low EHCO Quality: Respondents have also pointed out that contrary to the
original assessment, it has been expected from the outset that the API gravity
of the EHCO would drop from an average of about 8.6° API to about 7° API. It
was well understood that such a drop would have an impact on the yield rate at
the upgrader and, accordingly, the ultimate recovery of CCO. The [...]
Claimants denied that the lower API gravity was an issue, claiming that even
though the API in the southern portion of the [...] field was lower than originally
expected, most of the Hamaca reserves are in the northern part of the field,
where the API is higher than expected, such that the northern and southern
crudes can be blended before upgrading, with the result that the API gravity
would not be impacted. That argument was incorrect because, while it is true
that the southern part of the field has lower API gravity EHCO, the northern part
does not contain most of the reserves and the API gravity is not higher than
expected. Claimants did not repeat that baseless argument in this case,
replacing it with the assertion that “there is no evidence” that the lower API “has.
affected syncrude production.” This new argument is misleading because (i)
EHCO production has been lower than anticipated due to the very poor
performance of the upgrader (and despite the fact that non-upgraded EHCO
has been sold), meaning that the overall average API gravity has not dropped
as sharply as might have been the case had the upgrader been performing at

1102 Brailovsky & Flores ER |, RER-3, § 224; Brailovsky & Flores ER |, RER-3, App. BF-6 (Compensation
Calculations — Hamaca, Table 1).

300

the OSF Claimants project, (ii) the API gravity in recent times has frequently
fallen below (sometimes far below) 8.0° API, which is lower than the 8.6° API
specification for the upgrader and (iii) the problem will get worse as exploitation
continues and the reserves in the northern part of the field are depleted and
replaced with larger volumes from the south. In short, Claimants have no real
answer to the API gravity problem at the Huyapari field and its impact on
production at the Hamaca upgrader.11°3

Tank 12: Finally, with respect to Tank 12, a major intermediate tank at
Hamaca, Claimants state that the tank “apparently collapsed in 2011 due to a
fire on PDVSA’s watch.” That is an oversimplification. From the outset, the
operating procedures for start-up of the upgrader allowed light hydrocarbons to
be routed to Tank 12, even though its usual contents were the far less volatile
heavy fractions from the crude unit. Despite the fact that this upset condition
should have been anticipated, the tank venting system as designed was
inadequate to accommodate an overpressure situation when light hydrocarbons
were routed to the tank. A series of pre-nationalization overpressure incidents
resulted in deformations to the tank's roof and cracks in the walls, which were
contributors to the seriousness of the 2011 event. Because there was neither a
redundant tank nor a sufficiently sized bypass, the tank could not be taken out
of service for repairs without shutting down upgrader operations, and rather
than taking it out of service for a lengthy period and incurring the accompanying
loss of production, it was decided to monitor the situation. In 2011, another
overpressure event resulted in a fire and the collapse of the tank's roof, which
in turn caused significant loss of production in 2012. Claimants cannot rationally
contend that this incident — not unlike incidents at ConocoPhillips’ own
refineries and projects — could have been avoided simply because a
ConocoPhillips subsidiary, in addition to PDVSA and Chevron, would have
been a participant in the project in a “but for” world.11°4

756. In sum, the Respondents conclude that, “[the] Claimants want to leave the false
impression that the levels of production that have actually been achieved, when
compared to their claim of what the upgrader could achieve at a 91-92% OSF, are
due to the lack of ability or experience of the current operator. However, the fact of
the matter is that the upgrader was poorly designed on ConocoPhillips’ watch and
has suffered substantial problems throughout its existence. A 91-92% long-term OSF
has never been achieved. During its nine-year history, the upgrader’s actual OSF was
only 71.37% and, given the serious ongoing problems at the upgrader, a long-term
average OSF of 71.37% represents an appropriate projection.”

The Claimants submit that the Respondents’ arguments regarding the downstream
issues that allegedly affect the future performance of the Hamaca upgrader are
contrary to the evidence on record.

(1) OSF of the Hamaca upgrader

At the outset, the Claimants state that their expert Mr. Abdala, uses an average
production figure of 175,000 BPD of EHCO through the term of the Project and in this
process arrives at an average OSF of 91%. According to the Claimants, this OSF is
reasonable, meets the expectation of all Project partners prior to the Expropriation,
and is suitable for use in the but-for analysis.11°°

The Claimants submit that the RAM studies commissioned by the Project partners
allegedly projected OSF figures between 84% and 93%.''°” Upon receiving the last
study i.e. RAM IV, the Project partners evaluated the same and endorsed a long term
OSF of 91% at a Board Meeting of the Hamaca JVC on 18 May 2006." Pertinently,
the Claimants rely upon a presentation made to the Board of Directors on 17
November 2005.'°9 The Claimants submit that the aforesaid conclusion made by the
Hamaca Board of Directors is supported by the actual performance of the Hamaca
Project in the pre-Expropriation period. In particular, the Claimants point to the fact
that in 2005, the first year in which the upgrader went online, it achieved an OSF of
approximately 89% which was in excess of the RAM IV prediction. Similarly, in the
first five months of 2006, the OSF averaged over 91%.

The Claimants assert that based on the above figures, the Hamaca Business Plans
over successive years from 2006 to 2015 envisaged an OSF that would remain at
tates above 90%.'1° Moreover, the Project partners intended to make significant
capital investments to enhance and sustain the upgrader’s OSF. In the view of the
Claimants’ expert Mr. Earnest, such investment could be expected to yield a long
term OSF of 91.76%, which is consistent with the figure adopted in the Ameriven
Model and with the Claimants’ damages model.11"7

766.

As regards the Respondents’ arguments that the OSF of the Hamaca upgrader
should be fixed at 72.85%, the Claimants submit that these arguments should be
rejected as “a self-serving attempt to impose an artificial cap on the long-term OSF”,
for the following reasons:1"'2

First, these allegations are based on Mr. Figuera’s testimony, who had no
involvement with the Project from December 2007. Accordingly his statements are
uninformed and cannot provide a basis for making any findings.

Second, the Respondents’ position is based on the performance of the upgrader
under the direction of a new operating company which is entirely controlled by
PDVSA. According to the Claimants, there is strong evidence to suggest that
PDVSA’s_ post-Expropriation operation of the Projects suffered from severe
deficiencies and mismanagement, none of which can be attributed to the Claimants
when applying the but-for test.1""5

Third, the Respondents acknowledge that the mixed enterprise that has taken over
the Hamaca field is permitted to sell and has been selling large quantities of non-
upgraded products since 2009. Assuming that the upgrader was capable of
processing these additional volumes, bypassing the upgrader causes an artificial
reduction in the OSF.1"4

Fourth, the Respondents’ OSF of 72.85% is incredible on its face and it implies that
the upgrader is not functioning nearly 30% of the time. However, if this were the case,
there would be no need for the Respondents to allegedly spend billions of dollars on
maintenance, improvements and turnarounds of the upgrader, the very purpose of
which is to achieve enhanced OSF. The OSF suggested by the Respondents is
inconsistent with the amounts spent by them to maintain and more pertinently, to
improve the upgrader’s performance.1""5

In light of the above, the Claimants conclude that “the evidence solidly supports the
collective expectation of the Hamaca Project partners including Respondents here,
that a long-term OSF of 91% would be attained. Respondents desultory OSF figure of
72.85% based on their own alleged post-Expropriation performance, is irrelevant,

unreliable and unrealistic. Even if true, it would at best reflect post-Expropriation
deficiencies on the Respondents’ part, which could not be imputed to Claimants in the
but-for application. Both Mr. Figuera’s long-term OSF figure and Mr. Patino’s reliance

on this figure should be rejected by the Tribunal”.11"6
(2) The Coker unit

The Claimants submit that the Respondents’ allegation regarding the coker unit are
“no more than a transparent attempt to avoid paying what they rightly owe [the]
Claimants.”1"17

First and foremost, the Claimants point to Mr. Figuera’s testimony where he
acknowledges that the vibrations at the coker unit have not impacted CCO
production, and thus that there can be no impact on the valuation of the Project.1"®
Moreover, the Claimants assert that prior to the Expropriation, the Hamaca Board of
Directors had identified and agreed upon a list of appropriate corrective measures to

remedy or mitigate the problems of the coker vibrations.

Therefore, for the Respondents to now argue that the coker vibration poses a “risk of
catastrophic failure that would permanently disable the upgrader complex as a whole”
is “facially incredible”.‘"'9 In any event the Claimants submit that PetroPiar’s conduct
belies the Respondents’ above claim. Because, nearly 10 years after the
expropriation, PetroPiar has not taken any steps to correct the problem. Rather it was
only in 2012 that the Project company commissioned a third party i.e. Chevron
Energy Technology Company (CETC) to undertake an assessment of the vibration
issue and propose solutions. More to the point, it appears that despite CETC’s
proposal to carry out certain changes that will reduce such risk of vibrations, it
appears that none of these solutions have been implemented on the coker unit till
date.1120

In the circumstances, the Claimants submit that the Respondents’ allegations
regarding the operational problems at the coker unit and in particular, the suggestions
of its catastrophic failure are entirely baseless. As a consequence, the Claimants

argue that the 10% annual compounded risk of Project destruction factored into the
Respondents’ production forecast for the Hamaca Project is an artifice.

(3) Other operational issues

In respect of the operation issues raised by the Respondents pertaining to corrosion,
lower EHCO quality and the collapse at Tank 12, the Claimants’ expert, Mr. Earnest
submits that these issues are either minor or are attributable to the Respondents’ own
poor performance and therefore cannot be included in the production analysis. The
Claimants’ and Mr. Earnest’s views on these operational issues are summarized as
follows:

(a) Naphthenic acid corrosion: The record shows that corrosion was an
expected phenomenon issue prior to the expropriation and was being
resolved. Indeed, corrosion is a common issue at refineries and has
straightforward, well-understood remedies. Notably, one of Mr. Figuera’s own
exhibits contains a chapter entitled “corrosion: [a] natural but controllable
process’—which he conveniently omitted from the exhibited version.

(b) EHCO quality: There is no evidence that the alleged “quality” issues Mr.
Figuera raises—i.e., lower API gravity of the EHCO and higher carbon and
Sulphur content—have had any effect on syncrude production. As Mr. Earnest
explains, Respondents have vastly overstated any potential impact on
syncrude production in any event.112"

(c) “Tank 12”: This storage tank apparently collapsed in 2011 due to a fire on
PDVSA’s watch, caused by operator error. That is PDVSA’s responsibility,
and in any event would have been covered by Petropiar’s insurance policy
(which covers business interruption losses). 1122

In summary, the Claimants submit that none of the above issues should affect the

Hamaca Project's production profile in the but-for analysis.
iii. The Tribunal’s determination

The focus of the Parties’ submissions for the Hamaca Project is the Hamaca
upgrader. In particular, Parties are in disagreement as to (a) the Hamaca Project’s
OSF and (b) the possibility of the upgrader catastrophically failing due to attendant
problems with the upgrader’s coker unit. Accordingly, the Tribunal shall first address

121 Earnest Report, §§ 129-140. There appear to be multiple issues with the EHCO quality, chief among them is
the alleged reduced API of the EHCO produced at the fields. According to the Claimants’ expert, the problem is
overstated. Oil quality varies over time as a matter of principle/fact and refineries and oil manufacturers are used
to this fact. Also, the technical report on which Respondents rely has provided a solution. Namely, it states that
“the combination of maximizing the diluent API gravity through operational changes and the recovery of purge
naphtha in the new 10-C-005 Diluent Scrubber will reduce the volumetric impact of lower EHCO gravity to about
1.5 kb/d.” See Earnest App. MUSE 15.

these issues raised by the Parties, before turning to the other operational issues, to
the extent that they are relevant.

a. The Hamaca upgrader’s OSF

With respect to the OSF, in the Claimants’ case the Hamaca upgrader was of a “best
in the world quality” and would have achieved an OSF of around 91%. They submit
that a 91% OSF was the shared expectation of the Project participants before the
Expropriation. In support of their projection, the Claimants primarily rely on the RAM
studies and the Hamaca Board of Director's endorsement of a 91% OSF in the Board
Meeting of the Hamaca Board of Directors. The Respondents’ dispute the Claimants
interpretation of both of the above documents and contend that the OSF could never
have reached 91%.

Having examined the documents on record, the Tribunal is of the view that none of
the documents relied on by the Claimants support their thesis of a 91% OSF.

In particular, the Tribunal notes that it was the original goal of the Hamaca Project to
achieve an OSF of 93%.''73 The objective of RAM | was to determine, based only on
the current design of the upgrader, whether this goal could be achieved. RAM |
verified that based on the current design of the upgrader, an OSF of 93% was
achievable."'24 RAM II was issued 2 years later and re-examined the information and
assumptions forming the basis of RAM |. RAM II verified that the mean achievable
OSF was 86.4%. Further RAM II also stipulated that “According to Figure 5.2, the
project can be 95% confident of achieving at least an 85.6% OSF in a twenty year
duration [but that] [t]he confidence curves indicate that there is no chance (i.e. zero
confidence) of achieving the targeted 93% availability level’"'25 RAM Ill examined the
upgrader when it was 60% complete and provided the OSF that could be achieved in
seven different scenarios. It is worth noting that in none of these scenarios did the
OSF ever reach close to 90%.'!6 Moreover, RAM Ill also predicted that the OSF
could range between 84% and 86.75% with a mean value of 85.38%."'27 RAM IV,

which was issued after the upgrader came online in 2005, predicted that the OSF
could range between 81% and approx. 87% with a mean value of 84.386%.1128

Thus, contrary to the Claimants’ contention that the RAM studies predicted an OSF
range between 93% and 84%, the Tribunal finds that each RAM study predicted the
OSF that could be achieved over a 20 period based on the status of the upgrader at
the time of the study. As the Respondents rightly point out, with each successive
RAM study, the predicted OSF reduced and a 93% OSF was considered aspirational
at best. These studies were undertaken prior to the Expropriation and by independent
third parties. Neither the Claimants’ nor their experts have provided any plausible
explanation as to why the OSF continuously declined. Thus, the Tribunal is unable to
accept the Claimants interpretation of the results of the RAM studies or the fact that
this supports their prediction of a 91% OSF for the Hamaca upgrader.

Turning to the alleged endorsement of a 91% OSF by the Board of Directors of the
Hamaca Project, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants’ interpretation of the
Minutes of the Board Meeting does not withstand scrutiny. The Tribunal notes that the
presentation on which the Claimants seek to rely was admittedly presented at the
Board Meeting of 17 November 2005.''79 The original Minutes of the Meeting state as
follows:

El resultado de los etudios Ram fueron presentados sefalando que dichos
estudios empezaron muy temprano; se presentaron los etudios Ram |, Ram Il y
Ram Ill, indicando que este ultimo fue un etudio mas detallado considerando
rangos especificos utilizando informacion de otras partes del mundo con el
resultado de un rango de 85.,6% a 91,5% como factor de utilizacién. Ameriven
sefial6 que en el Ram | fueron muy optimistas indicando como factor de
utilizaci6n 93% y mencioné que tomando en consideracién lo que se construy6,
en un periodo de tres afios podria alcanzarse un factor de utilizacién de 91,4%.
Ram IV fue realizado con la informacion y el desempefio de Ameriven del afio
2005 dando como resultado un factor de utilizacién de 84,4%, adicionalmente
se mencioné que el Plan General de Negocios establece un factor de
utilizacién de 91,4% cifra esta que es compatible con el pensamiento de
ser la mejor planta en el mundo; pero se indico que seria un reto para
Ameriven durante los proximos afos el satisfacer esta expectativa. [...] El
factor de utilizacién del Mejorador para el periodo de los préximos 10 afios es
91,4%, en relacion con este asunto Ameriven mencioné que tenian que
resolver como alcanzarian este numero, si no el Plan de Negocios
necesitaria revision. [...]'°°

The results of the Ram studies were presented, indicating that the studies

began very early; the results of Ram |, Ram II, and Ram Ill were presented,

indicating that the last one was a more detailed study which considered specific

ranges, using information from other parts of the world, with the result of a

range of 85.6% to 91.5% as an On-Stream Factor. Ameriven said that in Ram |,

they were very optimistic, indicating a 93% On-Stream Factor and mentioned

that taking into consideration what has been built, in three years an On-Stream

Factor of 91.4% could be reached. Ram IV was carried out with the information

and performance of Ameriven from 2005, providing a 84.4% On-Stream Factor;

in addition, it was stated that the General Business Plan establishes an On-

Stream Factor of 91.4%, number that is compatible with the thought of

being the best plant in the world; but it was stated that it would be a

challenge for Ameriven during the next years to meet this expectation. [...]

The On-Stream Factor of the Upgrader for the next 10 years is 91.4%,

regarding this, Ameriven stated that they needed to figure out how they

would reach this number, otherwise the Business Plan would need to be

revised. [...]'"9"
In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Minutes merely take on record the
various findings of the RAM studies, and once again reiterate their “goal” of achieving
an OSF of 91%. At no point do the Minutes state that the Hamaca upgrader was
capable of achieving an OSF of 91%. Quite to the contrary, the Minutes state that: (i)
“[reaching an OSF of 91%] is compatible with the thought of being the best plant in
the world [...] but [...] that it would be a challenge for Ameriven during the next years
to meet this expectation”; and (ii) “Ameriven [...] needed to figure out how they would
reach [an OSF of 91%], otherwise the Business Plan would need to be revised”.""52 In
the circumstances, the Tribunal is equally unable to accept that a 91% OSF was

endorsed by the Board of Directors and should therefore be adopted by the Tribunal.

In sum, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have failed to establish that a
91.4% OSF was achievable by the Hamaca upgrader and that it should be used to
calculate production volumes.

In addition to the above, the Tribunal also finds that the Claimants have been unable
to disprove the OSF proposed by the Respondents. In particular, the Claimants
primary reason for questioning the Hamaca OSF is that the Project was under the
management and control of the Respondents and that the Respondents’ alleged
incompetence was in some way responsible for the low OSF. To this effect, the
Claimants state that “the performance of the upgrader in the post-nationalization
period [...] is based on the purported performance of the upgrader under the direction
of a new operating company managed and controlled by PDVSA."1195

However, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants’ allegations of mismanagement are
not sufficiently substantiated by evidence, oral or documentary. More to the point, the
Hamaca Project was not solely managed and operated by the Respondents, as the
Claimants allege. Chevron was equally involved in the management of the Project. It
appears that the Technical and Operations Manager of the Hamaca Project, who was
in charge of managing the upgrader, was in fact a Chevron appointee. Given the
involvement of another “commercial minded party”, the Tribunal is not persuaded by
the Claimants’ allegations of mismanagement of the upgrader.

The Tribunal notes that in order to arrive at their projected OSF the Respondents
have relied on the average of the actual OSF achieved at the Hamaca Project for the
11 full years of operation from 2005 through 2015. As per the actual performance of
the upgrader, the highest OSF was achieved only in 2005, when the upgrader was
brand new. Thereafter, in the approximately 2 years that the Claimants remained
participants in the Projects, i.e. 1 January 2006 to 26 June 2007, the OSF was
approx. 74% and then 81%. Thus, even when the Claimants were part of the Project,
the OSF did drop as low as 74% and in any event did not reach 91%. Thus, the
average value of 72.5% proposed by the Respondents in not inconceivable.'"54

In sum, the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondents’ OSF estimate for the
Hamaca upgrader is more reliable than that proposed by the Claimants and should
therefore be accepted.

b. The Coker unit

The Tribunal notes that the Respondents’ submissions regarding the vibrations
plaguing the Coker unit are interlinked with their submissions regarding the capacity
of the Hamaca upgrader.

In particular, Mr. Figuera states that, “In light of the upgrader’s very poor OSF due to
other issues, the vibration problem at the coker unit has not had a substantial impact
on CCO production to date. However, if the throughput capabilities at the upgrader
were to improve significantly (which | do not believe is likely [...]), the coker unit would
have to operate at higher severity, exacerbating the risks associated with the

vibrations.”115

1435 Figuera WS |, RWS-2, § 46.

791.

The implication of Mr. Figuera’s above statement is that if the Tribunal accepts the
Respondents’ OSF value, the “catastrophic failure” of the coker unit would no longer
persist. In light of the fact that the Tribunal has decided to adopt the OSF value
proposed by the Respondents, the possibility of “catastrophic failure” of the coker
need not be accounted for and it will not impact the production of CCO at the Hamaca
upgrader.

As to the other operational downstream issues (i.e. corrosion, damage to Tank 12),
the Tribunal finds that these do not materially impact the decision to prefer the
Respondents’ production forecast and hence, the Tribunal need not decide upon the
same. For the sake of completeness however, and because it impacts the decision
on other inputs, the Tribunal will briefly address the issue of the purported low quality
of EHCO being produced at the Hamaca field and whether this impacted CCO
production.

The Tribunal notes that, according to the Respondents, the Hamaca field started
producing lower quality EHCO which, in combination with the problems at the
upgrader, reduced the volume and/or quality of the CCO being produced. As a result,
the Projects had to start selling a lower quality CCO (referred to as the “Special
Hamaca Blend”), as opposed to the higher quality CCO marketed by the Hamaca
Project prior to the Expropriation.'°° The Claimants’ technical expert does not dispute
that, in principle, changes in the quality of the EHCO to be upgraded “would generally
tend to the make the EHCO either more difficult to process or would reduce the
quality of the CCO produced by the Hamaca Upgrader”.1"57

The Tribunal notes that the Respondents’ witness, Mr. Figuera, admits that, “given
the OSF that has been achieved, less EHCO feed to the upgrader than had been
projected at the outset has been required. The project has therefore been able to
maintain EHCO feed at about 8.2° API until now.”''8® This statement was made on 15
August 2014. Given this observation and its timing, and coupled with the fact that the
projected OSF of the upgrader is rather low (i.e. approx. 72%), the problem of EHCO
quality is likely overstated in that lower production and/or quality of the CCO

produced post-Expropriation seems to be attributable more to the upgrader than to
the quality of the EHCO feed. The Tribunal has concluded that the reduced OSF is
not attributable to any actions by the Respondents. Accordingly, any changes in CCO
quality due to problems with the upgrader’s performance would not be attributable to
the Respondents either.

OIL PRICES
The Claimants’ position

The second step in the Claimants’ quantum assessment is to apply a “market price”
to the “foregone production volumes” because of the DAs at issue.'"%? For historical
losses (i.e. from 2007 to the AUVM’s valuation date) the Claimants use the “actual
market price of crude oils” which are “publicly available”.''4° For the future period (i.e.
from the AUVM’s valuation date onwards), crude oil prices are projected “based on
currently available market information”."4"

Relying on their quantum expert, Mr. Abdala, the Claimants calculate the ex post
market price for the CCO of both Projects pursuant to the following inquiry:

i. First, the Claimants ascertain the “actual historical and projected future market
prices of a primary price marker”, namely, Brent.''42 To do so, the Claimants
elaborate a “single composite forecast for future Brent prices” until the
expiration of the Petrozuata and Hamaca AAs (i.e. yrs. 2036 and 2037,
respectively) by taking the “median” of “all available reputable Brent

forecasts” .1148

ii. Second, the Claimants determine the price differential between Brent and a
regional marker that, due to its associated higher refining costs, has
historically traded lower than Brent,'44 such as Maya crude oil, a sour and
heavy crude sold in the Mexican Gulf (“Maya”) often benchmarked against
Venezuelan crude given the commonalities between both.''4 The Claimants

reach this variable by “calculating the average differential forecasted by
[independent analysts who forecast both Brent and Maya prices] throughout
[the] relevant forecast period”.1'4° A median of 13.78% is then obtained from
the average differentials across the considered analyses. As such, Maya is
projected to trade at a 13.78% discount to Brent over the assessed period.
Conversely, Maya is projected to trade at 86.22% of the previously calculated
Brent forecast.'"47

Third, the Claimants determine the price differential between Maya and the
Projects’ CCO in order to project the latter into the future period."4° Here, the
Claimants compare the historical market prices of the CCO produced by the
Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects with the historical market price of Maya.'14°
The Claimants then apply the identified differential to the Maya forecast thus
arriving to the future forecast for each of the Projects’ CCO."® In this regard,
the Claimants submit that the Petrozuata CCO “has historically traded at, or
close to the price of Maya”.’"5' Hence, for the future period the Petrozuata
CCO is projected to trade on par with Maya (i.e. at a 100% of the calculated
Maya forecast).''? In turn, the Claimants observe a 5.56% premium in terms
of the Hamaca CCO-Maya historical price differential. The Claimants therefore
project the Hamaca CCO to trade at a 5.56% premium with respect to the
calculated Maya forecast.''®? Pursuant to Articles 14.2(g) of the Hamaca AA,
the foregoing 5.56% surplus differential accounts for an Adjusted Price
calculated commensurate to a Brent price set at USD 27 per barrel in yr. 1996
USD (indexed for inflation).1"54

794. The Claimants further submit that, in addition to the Projects’ CCO, the market price
projections of by-products such as coke, sulfur, and liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”)

148 Abdala ER |, CER-3, § 85. Mr. Abdala justifies the foregoing approach, “as opposed to deriving a Maya
forecast directly from the [available] Maya forecasts”, arguing that: (i) it allows incorporating as much information
as possible regarding crude oil price expectations; and (ii) using the median of the direct forecasts of the reviewed
Maya analysis “would have led to an almost identical Maya price series” (Abdala ER |, CER-3, fn. 63). The
Respondents’ adopt the same methodology (Brailovsky & Flores ER 1, RER-3, §§ 132-133).

should also be accounted for in computing Projects’ revenues on an annual basis.15°

In relation to coke and sulfur, the Claimants examine the “historical price information

[...] available until the date of nationalization and calculate a Brent differential” to

project said prices into the future period.''®° In relation to LPG price, the Claimants

calculate a specific differential of Brent, which is applied to both the historical and

future periods.115”

The Respondents’ position

In order to establish the market price for the Projects’ foregone production volumes,

the Respondents undertake a similar three-step inquiry as the Claimants.""°* Thus:

First, the Respondents project Brent oil prices into the future based on the
median obtained from multiple publicly available forecasts; '"5?

Second, they establish the price differential between Brent and Maya to then
apply the said differential to the projected Brent price (therefore obtaining the

warranted Maya projection); and

Third, they determine the price differential between Maya and the Project's
CCO to obtain the projected price for both the Petrozuata and the Hamaca
CCO."*' With respect to the latter, the Respondents account for the
calculation of an Adjusted Price pursuant to Article 14.2(g) of the Hamaca AA.
Thus, the Hamaca CCO is determined commensurate to a Brent price set at
USD 27 per barrel in yr. 1996 USD (indexed for inflation), whilst applying both
the Brent-Maya and Maya-Hamaca CCO differentials to said USD 27 Brent
price benchmark.1162

However, the Respondents also submit that, in estimating the Projects’ CCO price

projections, the Claimants’ historical and future periods are premised on: (i)

unsubstantiated assumptions; and (ii) non-representative data of the Projects’ actual

economics or of the crude oil market's recent conditions." In particular, relying on
their quantum experts, Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores, the Respondents argue the

following:

i. From the year 2021 onwards (until the expiration of the AAs), Brent must be
assumed to remain equal in nominal terms to its median forecasted price in
2020 without adjusting for inflation." According to the Respondents, this
approach factors in the current environment of crude oil prices. On the one
hand, it accounts for, inter alia, the decision by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) not to cut crude output despite plummeting oil
prices in 2014 (and continuing low prices ever since) along with a weakening
global demand.'"® On the other hand, it alternatively considers OPEC’s
recent waning role in terms of control over global production, which is likely to
shift investor focus on economic growth, inventory data, and_ political
disruptions (as opposed to OPEC production quotas), thus generating greater
volatility in oil prices.115° In this context, long-term Brent projections beyond
2020 are unreliable and thus it is equally incorrect to accept “simplistic rules
such as increases with inflation”.'1°” In turn, it is more appropriate to assume
an “equal likelihood that [Brent] prices will end up being above or below those
forecasted to 2020”.1168

ii. The pool of analyses forecasting both Brent and Maya prices used by the
Claimants’ quantum expert to determine the Brent-Maya differential must be
expanded.''®? Accordingly, Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores assess additional
forecasts to the ones already considered by Mr. Abdala. By doing so, Mr.
Brailovsky and Mr. Flores arrive to a median of 14.11% obtained from the
average differentials across all the relevant analyses.‘”° Differently stated, the
Maya-Brent differential is set at 14.11%. As such, Maya is projected to trade

at a 14.11% discount to Brent or, conversely, at 85.89% of the previously
calculated Brent forecast.

It is not entirely accurate to assume that Maya and Petrozuata CCO will trade
on par.'’71 A more comprehensive analysis suggests that the “historical
differential between actual Petrozuata CCO and Maya prices” for the relevant
period yields an average differential of 0.08%.''”? Therefore, Petrozuata CCO
prices ought to be projected as trading at “100.08% to Maya, indicating that
Petrozuata CCO will sell slightly above Maya”."173

iv. The alleged 5.56% of Hamaca CCO over Maya calculated by Mr. Abdala does
not take into account all the available historical data from the Hamaca
Project. Mr. Abdala “takes actual Hamaca CCO price data only from
October 2004 through May 2007”.''75 However, since 2008 the Hamaca
Project has been selling a “lower-quality [CCO] instead of the higher-quality
[CCO] that it had previously sold”."'7° On average, actual historical data
indicates that the Hamaca CCO (i.e. the post-Expropriation lower quality
CCO) has sold at 98.36% of Maya,''”” namely, at a 1.64% discount to Maya
which, “consistent with the historical experience”, should be projected into the
future period until the original expiration of the Hamaca AA."'78 By not
considering the foregoing caveat for the historical period, the Claimants’
5.56% premium “artificially inflat[es]” the compensation owed by the
Respondents.1178

projections based on historical differentials to Brent thereafter;''®" and (ii) on Brent

Respondents submit that revenues from by-products should not be accounted for
given that Article 14.2(f) of the Hamaca AA “exclude[s] such revenues” from the
compensation calculation for the Hamaca Project.1"8°

3. Analysis

798. The market price for the Projects’ production prospects is certainly an essential item
under the DA compensation provisions of both AAs. Its determination defines the
Projects’ revenues — an input that both Parties agree constitutes the starting point for
calculating the indemnity owed to the Claimants under the Petrozuata AA.1'84
Similarly, be it to calculate the Reference Price or the Adjusted Price, Articles 14.2(f)
and (g) of the Hamaca AA are clear in that the “SR” input of either the RNFC or the
TCF requires the determination of the price applicable to the Hamaca Projects’

production volumes.1185

799. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Parties and their respective quantum
experts coincide on the mechanics behind the calculation of the Projects’ price
variable. Indeed, both Parties: (i) refer to Brent and Maya as the two main pricing
benchmarks; (ii) elaborate a Brent price projection until the expiration of the Projects;
(iii) calculate a Brent-Maya differential in order to project the price of Maya into the
future period; and (iv) finally, calculate a Maya-Petrozuata CCO differential and a
Maya-Hamaca CCO differential to determine the price at which the Projects’
production volumes would have sold had the DAs at issue not been enacted. In doing
so, the Parties account for the quantum constrains imposed by the pertinent DA
provisions, namely, the requirement by the Hamaca AA to determine an Adjusted
Price commensurate to a fixed Brent of USD 27 per barrel.'18 The Parties also

186 Supra, §§ 558-561. Article 14.2(g) of the Hamaca AA states that the formula for determining the Adjusted
Price must be established either by the “Board” or by a “reputable” expert (supra § 557). The Tribunal is unaware
of said formula ever being determined by the “Board”. In turn, the Tribunal considers that the Parties’ quantum
experts in this arbitration are more than sufficiently “reputable” to determine the formula for the Adjusted Price.
Further, the Tribunal recalls that the Parties’ quantum experts agree on how to calculate the Adjusted Price

provide their respective calculations as to the surplus that could have been obtained
by the Claimants through the sale of oil by-products, such as coke, sulfur, and LPG.
Overall, the application of the DA formulae is not controversial.

The differences in the Parties’ contentions concern the scope of the data considered
in the application of the DA formulae, the justifications for the respective choices, and
certain underlying assumptions in relation to some of the relevant variables. In
particular, the Parties disagree on the following:

i. Whether the price of the Brent crude benchmark should be assumed to
remain nominally flat from 2021 onwards (until the original expiration date of
the Projects) without adjusting for inflation;

ii. Whether the Respondents’ assessment of additional forecasts is adequate in
determining the Brent-Maya differential;

Whether it is accurate to set the Maya-Petrozuata CCO differential at 100%
(ie., that the Petrozuata CCO will trade on par with Maya);

iv. Whether the price of the lower quality CCO sold by the Hamaca Project from
2008 onwards should be considered in the calculation of the Maya-Hamaca
CCO differential; and

v. Whether the sources employed by one Party to define the historical and future
periods germane to oil by-products are preferable to those used by the
opposing Party, and, finally, whether the DA provisions of the Hamaca AA
exclude the revenues of by-products.

The Tribunal now addresses each issue in turn.
The Brent price benchmark

The crux of the problem regarding the determination of the Brent price benchmark is
whether, as argued by the Respondents, it is appropriate to assume that, from 2020

 

(supra, fn. 1154, 1162). In view of this, the Tribunal deems that the requirement of Article 14.2(g) has been
complied with. On the other hand, the Tribunal notes that the Petrozuata AA does not contain a similar constrain
as the Hamaca AA in terms of requiring compensation commensurate to a fixed Brent price. Instead (given that
the historical and expected price of Brent has been above USD 25 per barrel in Yr. 1994 USD), it limits the
Respondents’ indemnity obligation to: (i) 25% of the harm suffered by the Claimants, as long as said harm for any
given year exceeds USD 75 million in yr. 1994 USD; or (ii) 0% of the corresponding harm, if said harm for any
given year fails to exceed USD 75 million in yr. 1994 USD. This is common ground between the Parties’ experts
(supra § 549).

onwards, the price of Brent will remain equal in nominal terms without adjusting for

inflation.187

The Claimants contend that there are no grounds to sustain such an assumption. In

their view:

Brailovsky & Flores seek to justify this constant price assumption by claiming

that there are not enough market oil-price forecasts beyond 2020. But that is

incorrect: as demonstrated in Dr. Abdala’s Second Report, there are a sufficient

number of market forecasts extending beyond 2020 to construct a reliable

sample, including a forecast from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy

Information Administration. In any event, even if that were not so, there would

be no excuse for refusing to recognize price inflation after 2020, as the

Brailovsky & Flores forecast irrationally does.118°
Particularly with respect to the Respondents’ position not to account for inflation, the
Claimants further emphasize that “Brailovsky & Flores [do] apply inflation of 2% per
year to Project costs. As a result, [...] crude oil becomes less and less valuable over
time in real terms, while extracting it becomes ever more costly”."'8° According to the
Claimants, the Respondents’ valuation requires accepting that “price of oil stays the
same beyond 2020, while the price of everything else goes up”;''®° a premise that,
according to Mr. Abdala, “implies that profit margins become consistently lower over
time”,""9'_ and this, in the Claimants’ view, “is neither economically nor historically
plausible”.1192

The Claimants accurately describe the Respondents’ position. Indeed, in light of an
identified high volatility of oil prices, the Respondents contend that “forecasting long-
term oil prices is a particularly speculative exercise”.'19° According to the
Respondents’ quantum experts, that explains why “most forecasters simply do not
forecast prices more than a few years ahead”.''*4 Moreover, with respect to the non-
inflation of Brent prices vis-a-vis a projected 2% inflation of the Projects’ costs, Mr.
Brailovsky and Mr. Flores find “nothing odd about profit margins decreasing for
particular industries, both historically and in the present”.1'> This is particularly so in

the oil industry, where profit margins in akin traditional industries are reportedly “being
squeezed”.1196 In this context, the Respondents’ quantum experts note that, amidst
OPEC's possible market power decline, its hindered capacity to “set crude oil prices
above competitive levels” is likely to prompt reduced profit margins as in all other
“fully competitive markets”.1197

The Tribunal finds the Respondents’ and their experts’ concerns and allegations to be
justified. First, the Tribunal notes that neither the Claimants nor Mr. Abdala challenge
the Respondents’ assessment of the recent developments in the oil market industry
underlying the Respondents’ Brent assumptions." In particular, the Claimants have
not challenged the Respondents’ arguments in relation to, inter alia: (i) the recent oil
price plummet, which Mr. Brailovksy and Mr. Flores describe as a “structural change”
in oil pricing;*"% (ii) the statement that the number of Brent forecasts projecting prices
beyond 2021 tend to narrow by over 60%;'2 and (iii) the possible impact in oil
demand of alternative technologies within the automobile industry.'2°' In fact, Mr.
Abdala himself recognizes the “difficult[ies]” of “predict[ing]” oil prices.12°2

Second, the sample of long-term Brent pricing forecasts considered by the Claimants
and their quantum expert seems insufficient and unconvincing. The Tribunal has
noted that, contrary to Mr. Brailovksy’s and Mr. Flores’ assertion that “there are too
few long-term forecasts upon which to rely”, Mr. Abdala affirms that there are “many
long-term Brent forecasts beyond 2020”;17°5 thus Mr. Abdala purports to rely on “15
sources of Brent forecasts to 2025”.124 However, in the Tribunal’s view Mr. Abdala’s

response does not withstand scrutiny.

811.

On the one hand, as pointed out by the Respondents’ quantum experts, out of the
fifteen forecasts assessed by Mr. Abdala “seven [...] do not provide annual
projections of crude oil prices beyond 2020; rather, they provide only a single
estimated average price for the five year period from 2021 through 2025”.'2°5 This is
the case of the forecasts issued by Moody’s Analytics, Investec, Credit Suisse,
Morgan Stanley, GKI Research, Commonwealth Bank, and Banco de Crédito del

Pert.1206

On the other hand, perhaps to level out the aforementioned seven forecasts with
those remaining in his sample (which do project Brent prices through 2037), Mr.
Abdala “extends [said] seven forecasts through 2037 assuming a 2% annual inflation,
even though the forecasters do not make that assumption themselves”.12°” It
follows that, somewhat consistent with Mr. Brailovsky’s and Flores’ observation that
long-term forecasts are scarce compared to short-term forecasts,'2°° Mr. Abdala’s
sample of true long-term forecasts must be deemed reduced by a 53.3% (i.e. from
fifteen to eight). The Parties do not directly discuss whether the reliability of Mr.
Abdala’s Brent price calculations are affected by this fact. Nevertheless, the Tribunal
finds it telling that the Claimants’ quantum expert projected such a fundamental
pricing benchmark without properly representing the assessed data.

Third, the evidence on record suggests that long-term forecasts are particularly
speculative. The considerable variation in terms of Brent price estimation between Mr.
Abdala’s first and second expert reports attest to that. As correctly noted by Mr.
Brailovsky and Mr. Flores:

In his first report in this Arbitration (filed on July 2015), [Mr. Abdala] projected
that Brent prices would reach US$ 100 per barrel in 2024. In his second report,
just 10 months later, he projected that Brent prices would reach US$ 100 per
barrel in 2034, 10 years later. That a long-term projection would change so
dramatically in just 10 months shows the lack of reliability of any long-term price
projection.1299

The Tribunal agrees and further notes that even the Claimants’ internal documents

confirm the apprehension towards relying on long-term price forecasts. During its
2014 annual stockholder meeting, ConocoPhillips only forecasted oil prices through

814.

2017.121° Moreover, it did so with a broad margin of error. For instance, for Brent,
ConocoPhillips estimated prices ranging from approximately USD 80 to USD 120 per
barrel;'21" a projection that in any event certainly failed to “contemplate the possibility
of oil prices dropping into the [USD 30 to USD 40 per barrel] range, as occurred in
2015 and 2016”.1212

Subsequent to this price drop, ConocoPhillips issued an update to its investors on 2
June 2016. There, it did not make any projections beyond 2017.'29 In addition,
ConocoPhillips: (i) acknowledged some of the macroeconomic contingencies driving
down oil prices advanced by the Respondents in this arbitration, such as “excess
[crude] inventories and ongoing demand uncertainty”;'2'4 (ii) noted that “rating
agencies” have “materially lowered long-term price outlook[s]”;'2"5 and (iii) more
importantly, recognized that the “[p]ath to price recovery remains unclear’”.12"6

In light of the aforementioned circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the
Respondents’ calculations up to 2020 are appropriate (i.e. reaching Brent price of
USD 67.50 per barrel in 2020). Indeed, insofar as they represent short-term
projections, the Tribunal deems them more reliable than the Claimants’. That being
said, the Tribunal finds that assuming a nominally flat Brent price of USD 67.50 per
barrel from 2021 until the expiration of both Projects,’2"” is unfathomable. This is
particularly so given that, as pointed out by the Claimants, the Respondents precisely
apply a post-2020 yearly 2% inflation rate to the Projects’ costs.'2"8

The Respondents provide an explanation for such an assumption, by stating that, “in
the current environment, long-term crude oil price forecasts assuming simplistic rules
such as increases with inflation are simply not reliable”.'2"9 The implication of that,
however, is that world oil prices will be immune to inflation; an assumption that is
untenable and in any event has not been adequately substantiated by either the
Respondents or their quantum experts.

In turn, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants’ assumption of a 2% yearly inflation rate
applicable to Brent is reasonable. Therefore, the Tribunal shall apply a 2% inflation
rate to the Respondents’ post-2020 Brent forecast.'?2° This results in the price of
Brent reaching USD 94.52 per barrel in 2037.

The Brent-Maya differential

The Claimants argue in favor of a Maya differential of a 13.78% discount to Brent (i.e.
Maya is projected to trade at 86.22% of the determined Brent forecast),'22' while the
Respondents submit that a 14.11% differential is more appropriate (i.e. Maya is
projected to trade at 85.89% of the determined Brent forecast).'??2 The variation
between the Parties’ differentials boils down to the Respondents’ consideration of
additional independent analyses forecasting both Brent and Maya prices throughout
the relevant forecast period.1273

The Claimants’ quantum expert does not per se contest the use of additional sources
in calculating the Brent-Maya differential. Rather, Mr. Abdala submits that the
Respondents’ quantum experts “end up with an overestimated differential” by: (i)
basing their calculation on both “short-term forecasts (Barclays, Platts and JP
Morgan)” and “long-term forecasts”;'?*4 and (ii) assigning “the same weight to the
short-term differential forecasts as the long-term differential forecasts, despite the fact
that long-term differentials are generally lower than short-term differentials (and short-
term forecasts were trending downwards)”.1225

The Tribunal finds Mr. Abdala’s arguments to be unpersuasive. First, as pointed out
by Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores,'226 the Tribunal notes that Mr. Abdala also relied on
both short-term and long-term differentials in his first expert report. In particular, Mr.
Abdala then based his calculations on, inter alia, one of the criticized short-term

forecasts used by the Respondents’ quantum experts, namely, Platts.1?2” In view of
the foregoing, the Tribunal observes that Mr. Abdala “first calculate[d] the average
implied price differential forecasted for each individual analyst for the forecast period,
and then compute[d] the median of the average price differentials”.'2?° Therefore, in
line with Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores, Mr. Abdala likewise assigned the same weight
to short and long-term forecasts in his initial determination of the Brent-Maya
differential.'22°

819. Second, it does not seem to the Tribunal that the consideration of additional short-
term forecasts together with long-term forecasts would be unwarranted. To the
contrary, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondents’ quantum experts in that, “given
[the] few forecasters [...] for Maya, using short-term forecasts (when available)
alongside long-term forecasts can help increase the sample size and the reliability of
the median differential”.'2°° To some extent, Mr. Abdala appears to share the same
understanding. Indeed, when justifying his methodology for calculating the Brent-
Maya differential (i.e. using forecasts employing both Maya and Brent as opposed to
those exclusively using Maya-based forecasts and with which the Respondents
agree), Mr. Abdala stressed the importance of “allow[ing] the “incorporat[ion]” of “as
much information as possible regarding crude oil price expectations”.'1 The
exclusion of additional short-term forecasts (and arguably less speculative), such as
those employed by the Respondents, seems to run contrary to that logic.

820. In light of the above, the Tribunal deems that the Respondents’ expansion of the pool
of assessed forecasts is apposite for the purposes of achieving a more solid
statistical sample. This will in turn lead to greater confidence in the projected forecast.
Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that the Maya differential must be set as

1227 Abdala ER |, CER-3, § 189. The Tribunal notes that the Platts forecast was initially considered by Mr. Abdala
to be a long-term forecast (Abdala ER |, CLEX-039, pp. 1, 3). Such a classification, however, does not withstand
scrutiny. Unlike the other forecasts used by Mr. Abdala (i.e. AJM Deloitte, Sproule, Turner, Mason & Company,
IHS, GLJ Petroleum Consultants, and Wood Mackenzie), which project prices through the expiration of the AAs,
Platts only accounts for a 5-year forecast.

1228 Abdala ER |, CER-3, § 189.

1229 The Tribunal notes that, in his second expert report, Mr. Abdala disposed of the use of short-term forecasts.
Indeed, the Platts short-term forecast appears to have been replaced by a long-term forecast issued by BMO
(Abdala ER II, CLEX-079, p. 2). This perhaps explains why the 14.81% differential established in Mr. Abdala’s
first expert report was subsequently reduced to a 13.78% differential in his second expert report (Abdala ER |,
CER-3, §§ 190, 86; Abdala ER Il, CER-8, § 92). Nevertheless, the foregoing substitution simply maintains the
same number of forecasts in the Claimants’ pool of assessed samples. The fact that the Respondents’ quantum
experts consider additional forecasts, albeit both short and long-termed, seems preferable in terms of attaining a
more reliable differential (infra, § 603).

calculated by the Respondents’ quantum experts, namely, at a 14.11% discount to
Brent.

The Maya-Petrozuata CCO differential

On this point, the Parties are in virtual agreement. The Claimants suggest a Maya-
Petrozuata CCO differential of 0%, that is, an estimation that the Petrozuata CCO will
trade at 100% of the calculated Maya forecast.'25? The Respondents’ position varies
slightly: they calculate a Maya-Petrozuata CCO differential of 0.08%, suggesting that
the Petrozuata CCO will trade at 100.08% to Maya. 1253

The Tribunal is of the view that the Respondents’ calculations are preferable. First,
the Tribunal notes that Mr. Abdala’s 0% differential is premised on the observation
that, historically, the Petrozuata CCO has traded “at” or “close” to the price of
Maya.'2*4 Such a standard, being undetermined, tolerates variations such as the
0.08% premium calculated by the Respondents.

Second, when confronted with the Respondents’ slight differential adjustment, Mr.
Abdala did not consider the calculations by Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores to be
erroneous. To the contrary, Mr. Abdala concedes to be “essentially [in] agree[ment]”
with the Respondents’ quantum experts,'2°> and that the latter's calculation “is very
close to [his] zero differential”.125°

Third, Mr. Abdala accepts that Mr. Brailovksy’s and Mr. Flores’ Maya-Petrozuata CCO
differential is “based on updated information on Petrozuata syncrude prices”.1257

Fourth, Mr. Abdala states that his calculation of the Maya-Petrozuata CCO differential
has been updated by “apply[ing] the actual information introduced by Respondents
for the historical period”.'2°° However, Mr. Abdala nonetheless “retain[s]” his
“forecasted Petrozuata syncrude price at par with [his] Maya forecast”.'2° The

Tribunal thus finds Mr. Abdala’s insistence on a 0% differential to be somewhat
contradictory.

826. In light of the above, the Tribunal determines that the proper Maya-Petrozuata CCO
differential must be set at a 0.08% premium over Maya. As such, the foregone
production volumes of the Petrozuata CCO must be indemnified under the DA
provisions of the Petrozuata AA assuming that the Petrozuata CCO has and will trade
at 100.08% to Maya.

d. The Maya-Hamaca CCO differential

827. The issue here relates to the post-Expropriation sale of a lower quality CCO trading at
a discount to Maya, as opposed to premium to Maya as occurred pre-Expropriation.
The Respondents contend that the need to produce said lower quality CCO responds
to the reduced performance of the Hamaca upgrader and the lower quality of the
EHCO feed in need of processing.174° In turn, the Claimants argue that the alleged
change in quality is the result of post-Expropriation managerial decisions for which
the Claimants “cannot be penalized”.1241

828. Having considered the Claimants’ arguments,'42 the Tribunal has come to the
conclusion that, post-Expropriation, the Hamaca Project has effectively sold lower
quality CCO at a discount to Maya.'43 This seems to be undisputed by Mr.
Abdala.'244

829. In this regard, the Tribunal has established elsewhere that the changes in CCO
quality are not attributable to actions by the Respondents.'245 In view of this, the
Tribunal finds no reason to depart from the ex post historical price data provided by

1240 Supra, § 796.iv; R-PHB, fn. 1722.

assumptions is Brailovsky and Flores’s use of a lower price for the syncrude sold by the Hamaca Project [...].
While Brailovsky and Flores and | essentially agree on the price relationship between Petrozuata syncrude and
Maya crude, we disagree with respect to Hamaca syncrude. Brailovsky and Flores rely upon pricing data from
crude oil sold by Hamaca post-expropriation, which was influenced by the sale of a lower quality, and thus
lower priced, syncrude”) (emphasis added). In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants refer to
“syncrude” or “SCO”, terms that stand for Synthetic Crude Oil, as upgraded ECHO (SoD, § 48). In turn, the
Tribunal recalls that the term “CCO”, which stands for “Commercial Crude Oil”, also refers to upgraded EHCO
(supra, fn. 1028). It follows that the terms Commercial Crude Oil, CCO, Synthetic Crude Oil, syncrude, and SCO,
can be used interchangeably (supra, fn. 900). Indeed, the Claimants themselves have expressly adhered to this
view (Tr. (Day 11) 2823:18 - 2824:2 (Flores).

1245 Supra, § 791.

832.

the Respondents (denoting that Hamaca CCO has traded at a discount to Maya). For
the valuation’s future period, the Tribunal shall therefore apply a negative Maya-
Hamaca CCO differential of 1.64%. Accordingly, the foregone production volumes of
Hamaca CCO must be compensated under the assumption that Hamaca CCO has
and will continue to trade at 98.36% of Maya.

By-products

The Parties’ submissions do not openly discuss the Projects’ by-products or their
pricing. Rather, it is the Parties’ respective quantum experts that deal with the matter.
In this regard, the Tribunal notes that there is only one main contention raised by Mr.
Brailovksy and Mr. Flores, namely, that the Hamaca AA excludes the consideration of
by-products when calculating the compensation owed to the Claimants under its DA
provisions.24° As such, the Respondents’ quantum experts submit that Mr. Abdala
errs by “including the by-product revenues in his calculations” for Hamaca, as he did
in his first expert report.1247

All the other specificities as to how to determine the sale price of coke, sulfur, and
LPG are not really in dispute. Mr. Brailovksy and Mr. Flores do differ from Mr. Abdala
in terms of the methodology and sources used to determine the historical and future
price for each item.'24® Yet, neither expert openly characterizes the other's approach
as flawed or necessarily incorrect. Accordingly, the Tribunal understands that it is
called upon to decide which employed methodology and sources are more
appropriate in light of all relevant circumstances.

With the foregoing in mind, the Tribunal notes that the exclusion of by-product sales
from the compensation owed to the Claimants under the DA provisions of the
Hamaca AA is ultimately uncontroversial. As to whether or not Article 14.2(f) of the
Hamaca AA excludes by-products, '249 in his second expert report Mr. Abdala stated
having “corrected the treatment of Hamaca’s by-product revenues under the
Discriminatory Provisions Scenario”.'2°° Correspondingly, Mr. Brailovsky’s and Mr.
Flores’ second expert report highlights as an “Are[a]r of Agreement between
Claimants and Respondents” that the “[clompensation calculations for the Hamaca

835.

Projec[t] assume no royalty on [...] coke and sulfur”.'25' Moreover, in his updated
valuation model Mr. Abdala only appears to assign value to revenues obtained from
CCO sales.1252 Therefore, the Tribunal is of the view that Mr. Abdala has addressed
the issue and deems the matter closed. In other words, the Tribunal does not needs
not make a particular determination on this issue, as a decision in favor of either

Party should have no impact on the quantum of this case.

With respect to coke and sulfur, the Respondents’ quantum experts rely on the
historical figures provided by Mr. Figuera to establish the coke and sulfur prices from
2007 through 2015. Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores then calculate the average
differentials to Brent, which they then use to project their coke and sulfur prices from
2016 onwards.'753 While adopting the same underlying methodology, the Claimants’
quantum expert obtains the corresponding Brent differential from historical data
running from 2005 to 2007 (i.e. pre-Expropriation data).1254

In the context of an ex post date-of-award valuation, the Respondents’ reliance on
post-Expropriation data is ab initio preferable. However, as established elsewhere, ex
ante data may be preferred where the Tribunal determines that a particular set of ex
post data is unsubstantiated.'25> This appears to be the case at hand. Indeed, the
data provided by Mr. Figuera to Mr. Brailovksy and Mr. Flores seems to be
unsourced; it lacks supporting documentation.'25° As such, it cannot be corroborated.
Given that neither the Respondents nor their quantum experts refer to additional or
otherwise objective evidence aside from Mr. Figuera’s testimony, the Tribunal deems
the Respondents’ coke and sulfur calculations and projections to lack documental
support. Accordingly, the Tribunal shall apply the calculations offered by Mr. Abdala

despite being grounded on ex ante data.

As to LPG, the issue turns on the calculation of the most suitable LPG-Brent
differential, as both Parties’ experts define their LPG projection based on some

differential to Brent.'787 Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores calculate theirs from
differentials included in the ConocoPhillips Composite Economic Model.'25° Mr.
Abdala, however, is unclear as to the sources utilized for the calculation of his
74.49% LPG-Brent differential.'?°° In fact, the Tribunal notes that the Respondents’
quantum experts characterize Mr. Abdala’s differential as “unsourced”;'76 an
assertion that neither the Claimants nor Mr. Abdala appear to have rebutted. In view
of this, the Tribunal finds the Respondents’ LPG calculations to be more reliable than
the Claimants’. The LPG price projection must therefore be calculated in accordance
with an LPG-Brent differential of 57.86%, as calculated by the Respondents’ quantum
experts. 1261

PROJECT Costs

The next step in the assessment of damages is to determine the Projects’ costs,
namely the expected capital expenses (“CAPEX”) and the expected operating
expenses (“OPEX”). This input of the quantum analysis actually comprises two sub-
inputs: first, whether actual costs incurred post-Expropriation should be accounted for
in the costs projections and to what extent; and second, how should the overall costs
be adjusted to account for macroeconomic factors such as inflation and prevailing
exchange rate between the Venezuelan Bolivar and the USD (the latter being the
currency in which revenues were earned). The Tribunal will first set out the Parties’
positions before setting out its determination of the above two issues in turn.

The Claimants’ position

In respect of the Projects’ expected costs, Mr. Abdala argues that “production and
costs are closely related, as costs represent the inputs needed to obtain a certain
level of production”.'6* Consequently, in order to ensure consistency between his
cost and production estimates, Mr. Abdala relies on the same pre-Expropriation
business planning documents that he used to forecast the production volumes for
each Project: specifically, the Composite Economic Model for the Petrozuata Project
and the Ameriven Model for the Hamaca Project.

The Composite Economic Model estimates total CAPEX (expressed in real terms) for
the Petrozuata Project as USD 1,955 million from June 2007 until 2036.126° Similarly,
the Ameriven Model estimates total CAPEX (in real terms) for the Hamaca Project as
USD 3,369 million from June 2007 until 2037.16 The aggregate OPEX predicted by
these Models for both Projects is USD 27.5 billion. Mr. Abdala then adjusts these
projections upwards to obtain the nominal values. 1265

As was the case with production volumes, Mr. Abdala states that he cannot rely on
the actual post-Expropriation data as it does not accurately reflect the costs that
would have been incurred applying a but-for analysis. Hence, he uses the projections
in the abovementioned models instead. 1766

Having so determined the costs estimates and projections, Mr. Abdala adjusts the
same to bring them to nominal terms by applying the US Producer Price Index for
inflation.

Turning to the Respondents’ case on Project costs, the Claimants submit that the
“additional costs” sought to be included by Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores are “(i)
unreasonable and/or unnecessary; (ii) unsupported by the evidence; and (iii) ever-
changing, and therefore unreliable”.'2°” On this basis, the Claimants assert that the
additional costs sought to be included by the Respondents should be disallowed.

In addition, Mr. Abdala also states that Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores overstate costs
by using an exchange rate for Bolivar-denominated costs that does not reflect how
the Projects would have operated with a private entity like the Claimants. In doing so,
the Respondents further reduce the extent of damages payable. 126°

In sum, the Claimants assert that the Tribunal should disregard the additional costs
proposed by the Respondents and instead adopt the costs projections in the 2006
Models alone. Moreover, with respect to applicable inflation and exchange rates, the

1263 Abdala ER |, CER-3, § 78; CLEX-007.
1264 Abdala ER |, CER-3, § 72; CLEX-031.

1265 Nominal values are those that are adjusted for inflation. The Parties’ arguments regarding inflation will be
discussed subsequently. Mr. Abdala converts the constant-dollar operating expenses projections to U.S. nominal-
dollar terms using an escalation index composed of: (a) a specific U.S. PPI index measuring inflation in the E&P
industry between year 2006 and the date of valuation; and (b) anticipated E&P inflation, which he estimates by
using an index composed of expected U.S. general inflation (weighted 85%) and expected crude oil price
variation (weighted 15%) from the date of valuation.

847.

Claimants emphasize that a more favourable exchange rate should apply in order to
nullify the effect of inflation, and provide a true reflection of Project costs.

The Respondents’ position

Although the Respondents also start their cost estimates with the Composite
Economic Model and the Ameriven Model, they disagree with the approach followed
by the Claimants which in their view “fails to take into account actual operating
experience from 2007” and assumes that costs unforeseen in the 2006 models would
not have been incurred in the but-for scenario. 176°

The Respondents’ experts state that it is an “elementary fact that, because of the
inherent uncertainties in oil development projects, budgets are frequently revised and
updated. These updates include managerial changes, such as the decision to drill
additional wells, or adjustments to account for macroeconomic factors, such as
changes in oil prices or host-country inflation.”'?”° Accordingly, they assert that the
2006 business documents cannot form the exclusive basis for assessing costs in a
but-for analysis. Consequently, in order to account for the environment that the
Projects would have experienced, the Respondents’ experts include actual ex post
cost data based on the testimony of Mr. Figuera and Mr. Patino.'2”' The additional
costs included by the Respondents are costs incurred for well drilling and repairs,
solids handling, turnaround and maintenance of the Projects’ upgraders and other
operational costs not contemplated in the 2006 business planning documents, which
resulted in higher OPEX and CAPEX for the Projects.

In response to the Claimants’ criticism of their cost projections, the Respondents
submit that the costs sought to be included by them are sufficiently substantiated and
reliable and should therefore be included.

Having thus provided their cost estimates, which include actual ex post costs, the
Respondents adjust these costs for inflation. In this respect, the Respondents critique
the Claimants’ approach, asserting that by “convert[ing] the bolivar-based costs from
the 2006 models to their [USD] equivalents in 2006 [USD] [and] then inflat[ing] those
costs using a U.S. inflation index [the Claimants] completely immunize the Projects

from Venezuelan inflation and exchange rate policies, as if the Projects were located
in Texas, [and] subject only to U.S. inflation.”12’2

The Respondents recall that the Projects were in Venezuela and thus take into
consideration Venezuelan inflation rates and the absence of timely devaluation of the
Bolivar, which together resulted in increased costs. Accordingly, while accounting for
inflation and exchange rates, the Respondents’ experts duly account for the Projects’
costs actually incurred in Bolivars and are therefore subject to the effects of the

Venezuelan macroeconomic factors. 127
Analysis

The Tribunal notes that the starting point for both Parties’ experts to estimate Projects
costs in the but-for analysis are the 2006 business planning documents previously
used by Mr. Abdala to forecast oil production, i.e., the Composite Economic Model for
the Petrozuata Project and the Ameriven Model for the Hamaca Project.

From this common starting point however, the Parties’ experts go their separate
ways. The dispute in connection with the Project's CAPEX and OPEX projections
revolves around the following issues: first, whether the Projects costs should be
purely those indicated in the 2006 models (as argued by the Claimants) or whether
they should take into account additional costs incurred/to be incurred by the Projects
after the Expropriation (as argued by the Respondents) (IV.D.3.a). Second, having
determined the Projects costs, how should inflation and exchange rates be accounted
for (IV.D.3.b).

The Tribunal addresses each of the above issues below.

Whether the Projects’ cost projections should include post-Expropriation
“additional costs”?

The Tribunal notes that the dispute between the Parties revolves around whether or
not the following categories of costs should be included as part of Project costs in an

ex post valuation:'2”4

1272 R-PHB, § 772.

1273 Brailovsky & Flores ER |, RER-3, n 65; Brailovsky & Flores ER 2, RER-7, §§ 46-47, 57-61, 157.

1274 The Tribunal notes that the dispute is not whether a particular category of cost should be accounted towards
OPEX or CAPEX, but rather whether this category should be included in the costs projections at all. In the

circumstances, the Tribunal shall examine each category individually to the extent that the Parties’ submissions
allow it to do so. The Tribunal finds that this is also reflective of the methodology in the AUVM. However, for the

i. Well repair costs;
ii. Costs incurred towards solids handling at the Petrozuata Project;

iii. Costs incurred towards PRAC and PREMs in connection with the Hamaca

upgrader; 1275
iv. Drilling and related costs;

v. Costs associated with upgrader turnaround at both Projects; and

vi. Costs associated with electricity generation, installation of firefighting

equipment and other upgrader related improvements at the Projects.

853. Given that the Respondents assert the inclusion of the above cost categories, the
Tribunal considers it apposite to first set out the Respondents’ position and then the
Claimants’, before setting out its determination with respect to each category.

i. The Respondents’ position

854. The Respondents overall position on the “additional costs” can be summed up as
follows:

[T]he “additional costs” included by Respondents and their experts in the
historical period are appropriately supported and would have been incurred in a
“but for” world. The costs that have not yet been incurred but that will be
required in the future are fully supported by the record. That some cost items
have been dropped (e.g. expansion and modernization at the solids handling
facility) or deferred (e.g. firefighting systems at Petrozuata) does not change the
fact that costs that were incurred would have been incurred in the “but for”
world. Finally, the fact that the pre-nationalization models do not include the
additional costs is completely irrelevant to an ex-post analysis. Indeed, the fact
that the Claimants’ ex post costs match their ex ante costs (except for U.S.
inflation) shows that their entire ex post analysis is not credible, as the one
thing certain in any long-term oil project is that cost projections cannot be
accurate for 30 years. The essence of any ex post analysis is to take account of
the changes that invariably occur over the course of those 30 years, not to
blindly follow projections that bear no relationship to reality, as the Claimants.
want this Tribunal to do.1276

855. In light of the above general position, the Respondents address each of the cost
categories and the Claimants’ objections to their inclusion as follows:

 

sake of clarity, the Tribunal notes that the disputed additional OPEX comprises of (i)-(iii) above and disputed
additional CAPEX comprises of (iv)-(vi).

Equipment”. See infra, fn. 1314.

859.

(1) Well repair costs

As regards well repair cost estimates, the Respondents’ experts propose a figure of
USD 360,000 (in Yr. 2007 USD) per well, on the basis that this was the same figure
proposed in the Mobil ICC and ICSID cases. In response to the Claimants’ criticism
that use of this estimate is not reliable, the Respondents explain that the wells at
issue in the Mobil cases and those at the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects are very
similar. Accordingly, it can be expected that the average cost of a relatively
straightforward well repair (such as a pump replacement) will be the same. '2”7

(2) Solids Handling facilities

The Tribunal understands that a significant amount of coke and sulphur are produced
as by-products when EHCO is upgraded to CCO. These by-products have to be
loaded onto vessels for transportation to markets elsewhere. The Petrozuata Project
operates a Solids Handling Facility where the solids (coke and sulfur) from the
Projects are collected, prepared for shipment and loaded onto vessels for export.1278

It appears that there were two post-Expropriation incidents in 2009 (i.e. after the
Claimants relinquished control of the Projects), which damaged the Solids Handling
Facility and resulted in several hundred million dollars being expended to repair the
same. That aside, while the Solids Handling Facility was out of commission, the coke
and sulphur had to be stored in temporary storage piles in the vicinity.'”9 For the
purposes of transporting the solids to the temporary storage, trucks had to be hired
and costs incurred in this respect. The Respondents claim additional trucking costs of
USD 250 million.128°

In response to the Claimants, the Respondents’ rather brief submission on the costs
incurred with respect to the Solids Handling Facility and those incurred for trucking is
that (i) despite repairs being implemented, the Solids Handling Facility was not
operating properly; and that therefore (ii) trucking costs had to be incurred and (iii) if
such costs were not incurred, it would mean that upgrading operations would have to

1280 These OPEX were incurred as follows: USD 7,151,325 in 2009, USD 3,001,293 in 2010, USD 35,322,929 in
2011, USD 96,351,309 in 2012, USD 64,466,776 in 2013 and USD 66,784,442 in 2014. Figuera WS |, RWS-2,
Annex E, nn. 171, Figuera WS |, RWS-2, nn. 153-154. Mr. Figuera notes that “the costs relate not only to

transporting the coke and sulfur, but, as the contracts show, also to the management of the large piles of coke,
labor, fire prevention and other costs”.

862.

be curtailed in order to reduce the production of solid by-products.'2°1 Thus in a
nutshell, the Respondents’ defense is that such costs were necessary and were in
fact incurred and therefore should be accounted for.

(3) PREM and PRAC costs

As noted above, the PREM and PRAC were authorized and implemented in 2012 by
the Project partners at the time (i.e. PDVSA Sub and Chevron) in order to improve the
OSF of the Hamaca upgrader. It is not disputed that despite the PREM and PRAC,
such improvements have been negligible.

According to the Respondents however, merely because certain costs are not
contemplated in the 2006 business planning documents is not reason enough to
disqualify them from being included in the ex post assessment.'2? They add that in
this instance, the PREM and PRAC costs were approved by all Project participants
including Chevron, and were pursuant to a detailed assessment of the problems at
the Hamaca upgrader.'26° As such, they contend that the fact that these costs had to
be incurred is not unjustified.

Regarding the Claimants’ contention that the PREM and PRAC costs are
unsubstantiated, the Respondents contend that the Claimants have “ignored the
stacks of documents that have been appended to Mr. Figuera’s witness statements
and produced in the document production phase of this case”.'?&* They further object
to the Claimants’ attempt to account for every single dollar spent and argue that the
evidence produced is sufficient proof that the amounts claimed have been incurred
and should be counted in an ex post valuation.'785 As regards the alleged lack of
substantiation of the cost of future PRAC and PREMs, the Respondents submit that
these have not been incurred and therefore by definition, there cannot be invoices or
other documents in support of the same. Instead, they note that their witness Mr.
Figuera has made a good faith estimation that the average cost of future PREMs will
replicate the average cost of the previous PREMs and on this basis arrived at cost
estimates.'28° Accordingly, the Respondents submit that the cost projections for

PREM in 2016-2022 are reasonable and should be accounted for in the ex post

calculations.
(4) Drilling and well pads costs

The Respondents allocate the following drilling costs: USD 2,900,000 per well for
single lateral wells used in cold production, USD 3,800,000 for EOR wells plus USD
1,800,000 per well for surface facilities for the Hamaca Project and USD 3,500,000
for dual lateral wells along with associated costs for the Petrozuata Project.'?67 In
support of their drilling costs estimates, the Respondents submit that the Claimants’
own witnesses have acknowledged the reasonableness of the Respondents’
projections. In particular, the Respondents point out that Mr. Brown testified that USD
3.5 million as overall drilling costs for the Petrozuata Project is a reasonable estimate
and also comports with the Claimants’ own estimates made in 2006.'788 This was also

confirmed by another of the Claimants’ witnesses during the ICSID proceedings. '2®°

As regards the Claimants’ allegation that the Respondents are including costs for
drilling wells fitted with EOR but not accounting for incremental production which
would result due to the use of EOR, the Respondents’ experts clarify that they have
only included the CAPEX associated with drilling EOR compatible wells. Their costs
estimates do not include additional CAPEX or OPEX that would have been incurred
had EOR projects actually been implemented at the Projects. Accordingly, they
submit that there is no contradiction between their costs estimates and production
profiles and thus, the former in relation to drilling costs ought to be allowed.'2°°

(5) Turnaround costs

According to the Respondents, the discrepancy between the “turnaround costs
implicit in the 2006 models and the costs actually incurred by the Projects shows the
absurdity of relying on outdated economic models”, as Mr. Abdala does, for projecting

turnaround costs.'2°1 The Respondents’ point out that Mr. Earnest himself confirmed
that he found the Claimants’ projections of future turnaround costs to be low.1292

As to the Claimants’ attempt to compare the costs of pre-nationalization turnarounds
with post-nationalization turnarounds and those projected for future turnarounds, the
Respondents submit that the comparison is inapposite for various reasons. First, they
submit that Mr. Earnest’s figures ignore the effect of Venezuela’s macroeconomic
factors, namely the high inflation experienced in the post-Expropriation period, which
would have the effect of increasing costs. 1295

Second, they submit that the scope of the pre-Expropriation turnarounds was much
more limited, inasmuch as they were only partial turnarounds or “Pit Stop”
turnarounds and thus rather obviously cost less than the full-scale turnarounds that
took place in 2009 and 2012. According to the Respondents, it stands to reason that
“more extensive turnarounds would be more expensive”.'?°4 They buttress their
argument by emphasizing that it was Chevron — a private commercial and
international oil company like the Claimants — that was in charge of managing the

turnarounds. 12°

Third, the Respondents rely on a study which reported that turnaround costs
averaged a 15% increase each year from 2000-2008'%° and the Project partners’
expectation in 2006 that a full turnaround would cost 5-10 times more, in support of
their higher post-Expropriation turnaround costs.

(6) Electricity generation and firefighting equipment costs

As regards costs incurred for the installation of firefighting equipment, the
Respondents submit that additional firefighting equipment has been installed at the
Petrozuata Project and that through 2014, approx. USD 10 million has been spent on

the same. The Respondents also submit that these costs have been sufficiently
substantiated. 1297

As regards the costs incurred for increasing electricity generation capacity at both
Projects, the Respondents submit that pursuant to a 2009 decree, PDVSA and its
affiliates received directions to reduce reliance on hydroelectric power due to a
nation-wide power shortage.'29° Pursuant to the aforesaid Decree, the Hamaca
Project allegedly installed 40 megawatts of power generating capacity at a cost of
USD 95 million. The Respondents submit that this cost has been duly substantiated
and should be included in the ex post cost estimates.'299

In response to the Claimants’ allegation that this cost is inflated, the Respondents
submit that the allegation is baseless as the “costs for the electricity generating
equipment were fully documented and approved by the PetroPiar Financing
Department, which was headed by a Chevron appointee”.19°

ji. The Claimants’ position

The Claimants reiterate their reliance on only the 2006 pre-Expropriation business
planning documents as their basis to determine the expected Project costs for the full
duration of the Projects’ terms.'°°' In support, the Claimants reiterate the same
arguments they had made in connection with production volumes. 15°?

Turning to Brailovsky and Flores’ costs projections, the Claimants note that the
additional post-Expropriation costs sought to be included in the Respondents’
valuation add a “staggering US$9.1 billion of additional costs items over the
remaining 30 years of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects’ terms” which “amount[s]
to a doubling of the expected per-barrel operating expenses, and a quadrupling of the
capital expenses”, vastly exceeding the projections made by Mr. Abdala.19°

First, the Claimants’ expert, Mr. Abdala, asserts that the Respondents’ cost projection
is a contradiction in terms. He points out that if the “additional costs” asserted by the
Respondents were to be accepted along with their reduced production volumes, then
the post-tax cash flows of both Projects would become negative post-2015 and
permanently negative in 2024 (for Petrozuata)'%°* and 2027 (for Hamaca).19°°
According to Mr. Abdala, if the financial performance of the Projects was so poor as
to make them commercially unviable, then they should have been shut down.
However, the reality is that the Projects continue to operate. In fact, they appear to
have generated dividends of around USD 8.8 billion in value to their shareholders
between June 2007 and 2014.13° In the circumstances, Mr. Abdala concludes that
the Respondents’ cost projections are facially incredible and ought to be rejected.

In the alternative, the Claimants call into question the “additional costs” alleged by the
Respondents on three grounds: either that they are (i) unreasonable and/or
unnecessary; or (ii) unsupported by evidence; or (iii) ever-changing and therefore
unreliable. On this basis, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to conclude that the
aforementioned categories of “additional costs” would not have been incurred in the
but-for scenario and should therefore be rejected. Accordingly, the Tribunal shall now
examine the Claimants’ arguments on each cost category indicated above.'9°7

(1) Well repair costs

With respect to the costs incurred for well repairs, the Claimants submit that these are
entirely unsubstantiated. The Claimants point out that the cost of USD 360,000 per
well (in Yr. 2007 USD) for repairs allocated by the Respondents’ expert, Mr. Patino, is
“based on the testimony by a different claimant in a different arbitration’'°°° and that

these costs are unverifiable. °°
(2) Solids handling costs

According to Mr. Earnest, the approx. USD 250 million costs that the Respondents
assert were spent on trucking costs (to collect and transport the solids to such

alternate storage piles between 2009 and 2014) are entirely absurd.‘9"° First, the
Claimants contend that these costs far exceed the amount required to repair the
Solids Handling Terminal and therefore it did not make commercial sense for the
Respondents to have incurred such high trucking costs.'*1! Second, Mr. Earnest
draws attention to a Government Inspection Report, which found that the contracts
with the trucking company used for transporting the solids were illegal.'°'? This
inspection report also found that the job of refurbishment of the solids management
area at the upgraders (which would have included the Solids Handling Terminal) was
awarded to a company with no experience and in fact the work was never completed
which contributed to the excess trucking costs incurred over a longer period of

time.1313
(3) PREM and PRAC costs

878. The Claimants call into question the additional costs of USD 1 billion allocated for the
PREM and PRAC maintenance of the Hamaca upgrader on the ground that (i) they
were never contemplated in the Ameriven Model; and (ii) the expenditures are
entirely unsubstantiated.'5"4 In this respect, the Claimants assert that of the 2012-
2015 costs actually incurred for the PREM, less than 15% is documented.'3'®

1310 C-PHB, § 818; Earnest ER, CER-7, §§ 102-104.

1311 The Claimants point to the fact that Mr. Figuera himself states that the cost of repairing the Solids Handling
Terminal would have been in the range of USD 37.5 million. However, according to Mr. Figuera, the Project was
apparently considering a solution that would use revenues from the possible sales of coke and sulphur to offset
the cost of the eliminating the coke pile. Figuera, WS 1, RWS-2, § 51, fn. 155.

1312 €.358, pp. 26, 29-30. According to the Respondents, the alleged illegality of this contract pertained to whether
the situation justified awarding of the contract without a tender process. The actual value of the contract was not
impugned. See Figuera, WS 2, RWS-4, fn. 50.

1313 Iq,

1314 It appears that after the 2009 turnaround of the Hamaca Project did not improve the OSF, the Board of
Directors of the then Hamaca JVC commissioned a comprehensive review of the upgrader by a joint team of
experts from PDVSA, Chevron and independent consultants. The team concluded that the upgrader was running
at very inefficient OSF. Accordingly, it appears that the then Hamaca JVC prepared two plans: the Restoration
Plan for Critical Assets or PRAC and the Restoration Plan for Major Equipment or PREM for improving the
performance of the Hamaca upgrader. The PREM was expected to be carried out annually from 2012-2022. The
PRAC was carried out in 2012 along with the Hamaca Project's third turnaround and allegedly cost around USD
313.2 million. The first PREM was also carried out in 2012 and cost around USD 44.4 million. Overall, the
Respondents’ witness Mr. Figuera states that USD 350 million was spent in 2012 on activities to improve the
performance of the Hamaca upgrader. Figuera, WS 1, RWS-2, § 40.

1315 C-PHB, § 835; Reply, § 455. The Claimants submit that of the USD 356,850,000 alleged to have been spent
on these PREMs, Mr. Figuera has provided invoices for only USD 8.6 million of USD 44.4 million claimed for 2012
(Figuera, WS 1, RWS-2, App 115), provided invoices for only USD 11.1 million of USD 67.5 million claimed for
2013 (Figuera, WS 1, RWS-2, App 117), provided invoices for only USD 23.2 million of USD 113.0 million
claimed for 2014 (Figuera, WS 1, RWS-2, App 118, App 166); and provided invoices for only USD 1.1 million of
USD 131.9 million claimed for 2015 (Figuera, WS 1, RWS-2, App. 167). The Claimants’ 15% calculation is based
upon PDVSA's proposed exchange rates; application of alternative exchange rates would mean that an even
‘smaller fraction of this claim is documented.

Furthermore, for the 2016-2022 PREM costs, no documentation has been supplied
by Mr. Figuera.

(4) Drilling and well pad costs

According to the Claimants, the costs for wells and wellpads are entirely
unsubstantiated and this should be dispositive of the case in their favour.'3'® With
respect to the cost estimated for EOR wells at the Hamaca Project, the Claimants
point to the alleged obvious contradiction in the Respondents’ case, where on the one
hand, the production volumes are estimated on the basis of cold production
techniques only. Yet, the costs take into account the more expensive wells that were
capable of supporting EOR.

(5) Turnaround costs

The Claimants note that the Respondents’ experts include “huge alleged past and
future costs for “turnarounds” i.e. upgrader maintenance shutdowns occurring
approximately every four years”, which are not only multiples greater than those
envisaged by the Project partners in the pre-Expropriation period,'3"” but also greater
than the costs that were actually incurred in the pre-Expropriation period. The
Claimants’ expert on turnaround costs, Mr. Earnest, illustrates his submission as

provides in his various statements for a Petrozuata turnaround originally scheduled
for 2015, which was then postponed into 2016, as well as Mr. Figuera’s estimates for
future turnaround costs at both upgraders”.'°"9 According to Mr. Earnest, when
compared with the pre-Expropriation costs, Mr. Figuera’s post-Expropriation costs are
“commercial nonsense”. Moreover, the Claimants assert that the Respondents have
produced no reliable evidence to support their proposal of such high turnaround

costs. 120

Finally, in order to expose the incredible nature of the Respondents’ projections, Mr.
Earnest reflects the turnaround cost as proposed by the Respondents as a
percentage of the construction cost of the upgrader. He opines that Mr. Figuera’s
projections add up to about 20% of the construction cost of the entire facility. In other
words, he explains that “if you have a five-room house, what Mr. Figuera would have
[the Parties do] is [knock] down one room every four years and [rebuild] it new.”"921

In conclusion, the Claimants draw attention to the fact that despite the massive
expenditures on turnaround and maintenance costs, the OSF of the upgraders
remained extremely low. Thus, not only were the Projects “money-pits” but also
uneconomical. To the Claimants, it makes no sense for the Respondents to
expropriate Projects that were in such a state and any arguments to this effect are

evidently self-serving. 1922
(6) Electricity generation and firefighting equipment costs

According to the Claimants, the costs for installation of electricity generation and
firefighting equipment were not contemplated by the 2006 business planning
documents and are not sufficiently substantiated. Accordingly, these costs should not

be included in the ex post cost estimates.'525

888.

Having examined the Parties’ submissions on the six categories of disputed
additional costs, the Tribunal sets out its determination on each category below.

First, with respect to well repair costs for the Petrozuata Project, the Respondents’
expert Mr. Patino relies on the well repair costs used in the Mobil ICC and ICSID
cases in connection with the Cerro Negro Project. The Tribunal is not persuaded by
the Respondents’ case and finds that they have failed to sufficiently justify why they
are excused from independently demonstrating well repair costs on the basis of the
existing wells at the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects. Given that it is the
Respondents’ own case to rely on actually incurred costs, they should thus prove
such costs. In other words, there is insufficient basis for the Respondents to instead
rely (as the Claimants put it) on “the testimony of a different claimant from a different
arbitration”, which is not in any way connected to the present arbitration. Thus, as far
as the well repair costs are concerned, the Tribunal finds that the Respondents have
not sufficiently demonstrated the reliability of their costs estimates.

Second, as regards the costs incurred for solids handling and for trucking, the crux of
the Claimants’ objection to these costs is that they are far in excess of the costs
required to repair the damage caused to the Solids Handling Facility, and thus no
prudent operator would have incurred such high costs for trucking as an alternative.
The Respondents’ only response to this contention is that the trucking costs were
allegedly necessary, have been incurred for five years between 2009 and 2014, and
must therefore be accounted for. They submit that despite repairs being carried out,
the Solids Handling Facility was not operating at optimal levels. Therefore, it was
necessary to continue storing solid by-products at the alternate location and incurring
the respective trucking costs.

The Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondents’ arguments. According to the
Respondents themselves, the cost that would be incurred in repairing the Solids
Handling Facility is approximately USD 37.5 million. In comparison, the amount that
was incurred by the Respondents in trucking costs between 2009 and 2014 is approx.
USD 250 million.'5*4 The sheer disparity between these two figures calls into question
the reliability of these costs. If, as the Respondents admit, repairs did not solve the
damage caused to the Solids Handling Facility, given the arguably lower cost of such
repairs, it would have been less expensive to undertake further repairs than to incur
exorbitant trucking costs. In light of the disparity, for the trucking costs to be justified

1824 The Tribunal notes that these costs have in fact been supplied by the Respondents themselves. See Figuera,
WS 1, RWS-2, Annex E, § 60.

342

889.

890.

891.

as necessary, the Respondents ought to have demonstrated that incurring additional
costs to repair the Solids Handling Facility would have been more expensive and
therefore commercially non-viable vis-a-vis incurring additional trucking costs.
Instead, the Respondents merely state that despite repairs, the Solids Handling
Facility continued to have problems and therefore the trucking costs had to be
incurred. As the Claimants correctly point out, that in itself is no justification for
incurring trucking costs which are almost five times greater than the cost of repairs,
and that too, for a period of five years between 2009 and 2014.'25 In light of the
above, the Tribunal need not examine the Claimants’ other argument that the trucking
contract was allegedly illegal and/or that the consideration payable under the contract
was allegedly inflated.

In the circumstances, regardless of the fact that such costs may have been actually
incurred, the Tribunal finds that they were attributable to the Respondents’ business
decisions. As the Claimants correctly point out, no prudent operator would have
allowed such costs to be incurred for an extended duration. Accordingly, the Tribunal
cannot accept these costs.

The third category of costs that is disputed is the costs incurred towards PREM and
PRAC for improvement and maintenance of the Hamaca upgrader. The Claimants
call into question these costs on the ground that less than 15% have been properly
substantiated. In particular, the Claimants’ expert found that of the USD 356,850,000
alleged to have been spent on these PREMs, Mr. Figuera has provided invoices for
only the following amounts:

i. USD 8.6 million of USD 44.4 million claimed for 2012;

ii. USD 11.1 million of USD 67.5 million claimed for 2013;
iii. USD 23.2 million of USD 113.0 million claimed for 2014;
iv. USD 1.1 million of USD 131.9 million claimed for 2015.

The Respondents do not deny that they have only provided partial invoices, however
these invoices are numerous. The Respondents’ counterargument is that, in
demonstrating costs, every penny needs not be accounted for. While the principle
relied on by the Respondents is practical, in the facts of the present case, the
Tribunal finds that the disparity between the amounts claimed to have been expended

1225 C-PHB, §§ 818-820

343

892.

893.

894.

by the Respondents, and the portion of costs in respect of which they have provided
actual substantiation, is too great. The Tribunal is of the view that this disparity is
sufficient to call into question the reliability of the Respondents’ costs figures.

The above is buttressed by Mr. Figuera’s admissions during the Hearing. When
questioned about turnaround costs and the documents he had provided to
substantiate the same, Mr. Figuera stated as follows:

Q. Now, your position is that, since the Expropriation, Project costs have

increased dramatically; is that right?

A. Yes, of course.

Q. And you asserted that there have been a number of new or increased

cost items that the Project participants didn't anticipate prior to the

Expropriation; right?

A. That's right.

Q. Now, with your various Witness Statements, you provided a few large

files of cost documents, including copies of contracts and some invoices. Do

you remember that?

Amazing numbers, yes. Significant numbers.

Did you compile those documents yourself?

No.

A.
Q

Q. The documents are not indexed in any way. Do you recall that?
A. No, | don't.

Q

le PdVSA did not have them reviewed or audited for the purposes of
this case by any accountant or other expert, to your knowledge, did it?

A. Not to my knowledge. "26

It transpires from the above testimony that Mr. Figuera merely provided an “amazing
number” of documents to purportedly support the Respondents’ costs claim for PREM
and PRAC, but that these documents have not been verified in any manner. In the
circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Respondents proposed upgrader
maintenance costs.

For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that the aforesaid costs are
comprised of the additional OPEX claimed by the Respondents and disputed by the

1226 Tr, (Day 5), 1256:16-1257:12 (Mr. Figuera)

344

897.

898.

Claimants. For the purposes of reflecting the above decision in the AUVM, the
toggles in the Costs Panel of the AUVM for OPEX shall be set to “Abdala”.'527

The next three categories of costs are the additional CAPEX costs that are disputed
by the Claimants.

The first of such CAPEX is costs incurred towards drilling additional wells at the
Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects. With respect to the additional cost of USD 3.5
million per well in light of the testimony given by the Claimants’ witness, Mr.
Brown, '°8 the Tribunal finds that the Parties are in agreement as to the cost of drilling
dual lateral wells. Therefore, with respect to such wells, the Tribunal finds that
additional costs of USD 3.5 million per new well can be included in the post-
Expropriation costs estimates.

What remains in dispute is the cost of drilling single lateral wells for cold production
as well as whether to account for the cost of wells fitted for EOR. With respect to the
costs of drilling single lateral wells for cold production, the Tribunal finds that the
figure of USD 2.9 million per single lateral well has been proposed by the
Respondents on the basis of Mr. Figuera’s testimony,'52° who in turn makes a good
faith estimate of the same. As the Claimants correctly point out, the Respondents
have not produced any documents to explain how Mr. Figuera arrives at such good
faith estimate. Accordingly, the Tribunal is unconvinced that the Respondents have
sufficiently established the cost of drilling single lateral wells.

Turning to the wells that were fitted for EOR, the Tribunal acknowledges that the
Respondents have only included the cost of drilling wells that are EOR compatible
and not the cost of actually implementing EOR techniques at these wells. However, in
application of the but-for test, the Tribunal must examine what costs would have been
incurred had the Claimants remained with the Projects. The Tribunal has previously
concluded that the Claimants were never contemplating implementing EOR
techniques at the Projects.'*°° Therefore, in the but-for scenario it is unlikely that the
Claimants would have signed off on the additional costs necessary to drill EOR
compatible wells (as opposed to cold production compatible wells), especially when
they would have gained no benefit from the same. Any reasonable and commercially

prudent entity would have ensured that such costs would have been borne by the
entity who would end up benefitting from the eventual EOR implementation.
Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the cost incurred for drilling EOR compatible wells
cannot be included in an ex post valuation.

The second CAPEX relates to turnaround costs for the Petrozuata and Hamaca
upgraders. In this respect, the Respondents rely on actual costs expended on the
turnarounds whereas the Claimants rely on the turnaround costs projected in the
2006 business planning documents. Having examined the Parties’ positions and the
evidence on record, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Respondents’ position.

First, in support of their turnaround cost estimates, the Respondents rely on a study
conducted by Solomon Associates (a firm that purportedly conducts benchmarking
studies in the refinery industry including studies concerning turnaround costs) which
predicted that the cost of turnarounds averaged a 15% increase each year from
2000-2008.'331 Having examined the document on record, the Tribunal finds that it
does not support the Respondents’ case in any manner. First, this document appears
to be a pamphlet or brochure and is merely two pages long. Second, the document is
taken out of context. There is nothing in the document to indicate how the above
conclusions regarding the increase in turnaround costs has been arrived at, much
less whether the same consideration will apply to EHCO projects in Venezuela. In the
circumstances, this does not in any way support the Respondents’ case.

Second, apart from the above study, the Respondents also appear to be arguing that
their turnaround cost estimates are reliable and justified in light of the fact that these
turnarounds were managed by the foreign partners in the Project, i.e. in the case of
the Hamaca Project, the turnarounds were managed by Chevron.'%*2 However, the
Tribunal is of the view that the participation of an international oil company in and of
itself does not justify or support the extent of the costs incurred on turnarounds and
those estimated for additional turnarounds. The Respondents cannot fall back on the
presence and/or participation of Chevron to substantiate their costs. In the
circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Respondents’ turnaround cost estimates
are untenable. Accordingly, the Tribunal shall adopt the turnaround costs estimated
by the Claimants.

1882 R-PHB, § 780.

346

902.

903.

904.

905.

The Tribunal notes that while the Claimants’ turnaround cost estimates do raise
certain questions, ‘995 on the whole they are more reliable than those proposed by the
Respondents. Additionally, it is also worth noting that the turnaround costs are a
significant portion of the Project's CAPEX and, as the Claimants’ have pointed out,
accepting the high costs proposed by the Respondents results in a situation where
the Projects would become economically unviable. 195+

The third and final CAPEX comprises costs incurred for installation of electricity

generating capacity at both Projects and for installation of fire-fighting equipment.

With respect to the costs incurred for the installation of electricity generating capacity,
the Tribunal finds that the inclusion of such costs is justified. As the Respondents
point out, the installation of such electricity generation capacity was mandated by law.
In that regard, the relevant provisions of the Decree state as follows:

BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA. MINISTRY OF THE POPULAR
POWER FOR ELECTRICAL ENERGY NO. 002. CARACAS, NOVEMBER 2,
2009

[el
CONSIDERING

That demand for energy is rapidly increasing, which makes it necessary to
adopt policies that promote the efficient use of energy and guarantee energy
sustainability for future generations of Venezuelans and protect the
environment;

RESOLVES:

Article 1. The Corporacién Eléctrica Nacional, S.A. (CORPOELEC), its
affiliates, Petréleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), its affiliates, and any
other State Company with thermoelectric generation capacity should
immediately proceed to carry out all necessary actions to maximize the
use of all of such generation, including the installation of new rapid-
response generation equipment units, recovery of unavailable units and all
those that are feasible to be put into operation within a period of no more than
six (6) months [...]'995

The reason for passing the above Decree was the rapidly increasing demand for
energy in Venezuela and not conditions which were attributable solely to the
Respondents. Accordingly, the effects of such a Decree would have applied even in
the but-for world to PDVSA and thus the Projects in which it was a participant.

1333 In this respect, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants’ expert Mr. Earnest did consider these estimates to be
“somewhat low’. Tr. (Day 8), 2270:20-2271:10 (Mr. Earnest)

347

906.

907.

908.

In addition to the above, the Tribunal finds that the Respondents have produced the
invoices necessary to substantiate the costs that are being claimed for such
installation.°° Thus, the Respondents have established that such costs were
incurred and were necessary. By contrast, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants’ only
defense appears to be that the costs are unsubstantiated, which is clearly not the
case. In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the costs incurred for the

installation of electricity generation must be included.

With respect to costs incurred for the installation of firefighting equipment, the
Tribunal finds that the Respondents have sufficiently substantiated the incurrence of
such costs through the testimony of their witness as well as the invoices provided.
The Respondents have demonstrated that the initial proposal to implement fire-
fighting equipment estimated the costs to be approx. USD 100 million.*997 Of this
estimated expenditure, the Respondents have substantiated the incurrence of USD
10 million through invoices.'** As regards the remaining sum, the Tribunal is satisfied
with Mr. Figuera’s explanation that these amounts are being deferred to future years.
In this regard, the Claimants have sought to call into question these costs on two
grounds: first, that they were not included in the original costs projections. However,
this is no basis to disregard a cost that had to be incurred. Second, they argue that if
a reasonable and favourable exchange rate were applied, the overall costs of the
firefighting equipment would reduce to USD 10 million. However, the Claimants’
second ground of challenge is defeated by the numbers. In that, the proposed USD
costs component of the firefighting equipment was projected at USD 25 million. This
component was not subject to any exchange rate and would not have reduced to
USD 10 million as the Claimants contend. In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds
that the costs incurred towards firefighting equipment should be granted in the
Respondents’ favour.

Thus, for the purposes of reflecting the above decision on CAPEX in the AUVM, the
toggles for “Drilling and Wellpads” and “Turnaround costs” should be set to Abdala,
and the toggle for “Others” should be set to Brailovsky and Flores.

1387 Figuera, WS |, RWS-2, App. 83 (PDVSA, Investment Proposals Summary Sheet, Improvements in the
Firefighting System of the Petroanzoategui Upgrader, July 2014). The costs for the firefighting project were
estimated in mid-2014 to consist of USD 25 million (in actual U.S. dollars) and 472.5 million Bolivars which, at the
official exchange rate of Bs. 6.3 per USD, was equal to USD 75 million.

Apart from the fact that the Claimants have successfully called into question the
Respondents’ cost projections, the Tribunal is also persuaded by the Claimants’
argument that if the Respondents’ costs projections were to be accepted, the Projects
would become permanently loss making. It stands to reason that neither of the
Project Participants would be agreeable to such an eventuality in the but-for world. In
the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that its decision to adopt the Claimants’ cost
estimates is also reinforced by these considerations.

What is the appropriate inflation and exchange rate?

The Tribunal understands that the costs projections in the 2006 business models are
reflected in real terms, i.e. they are not adjusted for inflation and the applicable
exchange rates between the Venezuelan Bolivar and the USD. Therefore, both
Parties’ experts adjust these values to account for inflation and exchange rates. They
differ however on the methodology followed to account for the effect of the
macroeconomic factors, as well as regarding which inflation and exchange rate
should be applied.

i. The Claimants’ position
(1) The Claimants’ position on inflation and exchange rates

Mr. Abdala converts the real USD costs projections to nominal USD terms using an
escalation index composed of: (a) a specific U.S. Producer Price Index (“US PPI”)
measuring inflation in the Energy & Petroleum (“E&P”) industry between year 2006
and the date of valuation; and (b) anticipated E&P inflation, which he estimates by
using an index composed of expected US general inflation (weighted 85%) and
expected crude oil price variation (weighted 15%) from the date of valuation. '%°°

Turning to the Respondents’ criticism of his methodology — namely, that Mr. Abdala
has ignored the significant increase in domestic inflation as experienced in Venezuela
since 2007 — Mr. Abdala states that this criticism is wrong as his methodology reflects
inflation as experienced in the industry from 2007-2015, as measured by the US PPI
for oil industry commodities.'°4° Importantly, as elaborated upon below, he does
acknowledge that the inflation index used by the Respondents’ experts to inflate the
USD-denominated costs is equally reputable.

(2) The Claimants’ position on the Respondents’ inflation and exchange rates

As regards the Respondents’ calculation of inflation and exchange rates, Mr. Abdala
states that “Brailovsky and Flores overstate [...] costs by using an [inappropriate]
exchange rate (to convert Bolivar-denominated costs into US dollars) that does not
reflect how a private manager would have operated the Projects [and that] [t]his has
the effect of reducing damages by US$ 1.4 billion under the Discriminatory Provisions

Scenario” .1341

With respect to the historical period, the Claimants submit that the Respondents’
experts’ critical mistake is that they convert Bolivar denominated costs to USD by
using the /owest official exchange rate, i.e. the CADIVI/CENCOEX, thereby “greatly
exaggerating” their cost estimates (when converted to USD).

According to the Claimants and Mr. Abdala, there were multiple foreign exchange
rates prevailing in Venezuela at the relevant time and a rational commercially-driven
entity managing the Projects, such as the Claimants, would take steps to avoid the
inflated costs assumed by the Respondents’ experts in their calculation either by
accessing the more favourable exchange rate or by minimizing exposure to
Venezuela’s high domestic inflation.1942

In particular, Mr. Abdala suggests that a “reasonable private manager’ of the Projects
would have taken the following steps to get past the effects of high inflation:

i. Financed the operations through intercompany loans, which would allow
access to more favorable, legal exchange rates.'®? In particular, the Projects
could have accessed the higher SICAD | and SICAD Il rates through
intercompany loans which would not involve the exchange of funds received
from the sale of hydrocarbons. 144

1341 Abdala ER Il, CER-8, § 66.b, Table 9. To this Mr. Abdala adds that if he were to accept the Respondents’
methodology and segregate costs in Bolivars and USD, but instead apply the best available exchange rate, the
resulting costs would be lower than what he has currently forecast.

ii. Obtained Bolivar-denominated loans to service the Bolivar-denominated
costs, and paid back the principal with USD once the exchange rate

normalised. 1945

Hired or outsourced certain functions to international suppliers and contractors
(including professional services firms, such as engineers, managers, and
other specialized labour), and paid them in USD (perhaps outside Venezuela),
thereby avoiding the exchange rate issue altogether. According to the
Claimants, there is no legal prohibition against paying one’s own employees in
USD and the relevant Exchange Agreement No.9 only prevents PDVSA from
paying its employees in the hydrocarbons industry in USD. No such limitation
applies to the Associations or even to mixed companies.'946

The Claimants further submit that the Respondents suggestion that only PDVSA and
empresas mixtas could avail of the favourable exchange rate is misplaced because
the Exchange Agreements treated empresas mixtas and Associations as the same
for the purposes of applicable exchange rate regime both before and after the
Expropriation. 1947

With respect to the projection period, the Claimants submit that the Respondents’
experts provide no basis for applying the DICOM and DIPRO rate on a 50-50 split
basis. According to the Claimants, the only reason for the Respondents’ suggestion is
to bring about a further reduction in the Claimants’ damages.'*4® Summing up the
argument, Mr. Abdala submits that “the difference in total costs put forward by the
parties’ respective experts is driven primarily by the selection of the appropriate
exchange rate [...] [and] when more favorable, legal exchange rates are applied to
Brailovsky & Flores’s [sic] own cost projections, their costs model substantially
coalesces as with Dr. Abdala’s”.1949

919. Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores emphasize that a significant share of the Projects costs
were incurred in Bolivars.'2°° Accordingly, they contend that different inflation indices
should be applied to the costs incurred in Bolivars and to those incurred in USD. For
costs incurred in Bolivars they use actual and projected inflation in Venezuela to
convert real costs to nominal costs and thereafter apply actual and projected
exchange rates between the Bolivar and USD to convert these nominal costs from
Bolivars into USD."55' As regards costs incurred in USD, they use a combination of oil
industry and CAPEX and OPEX specific international inflation indices to determine

the nominal value of costs incurred in USD. 1952

920. They apply the following inflation and exchange rates to adjust the costs incurred in
Bolivars:

i. From 2006 to 2015, they apply actual inflation in Venezuela as published by

 

the Central Bank of Venezuela, i.e the Consumer Price Index of the
Metropolitan Area of Caracas (“CPIC”);'° The Respondents’ experts then
convert these costs in Bolivars to USD by applying actual exchange rates
between the Bolivar and the USD through 2015, as published by the Central
Bank of Venezuela.'354

ii. For 2016, they use the IMF’s October 2016 forecast of Venezuelan
inflation;'5°5 As regards the exchange rate, from January 1, 2016 to March 9.
2016, they apply the CADIVI/CENCOEX exchange rate of Bs. 6.3 per USD to

convert Bolivars to USD. From March 10, 2016 and through the end of 2016,
they assume that the Projects would have access to the DICOM exchange

1850 According to Mr. Figuera, approx. 70% of OPEX and CAPEX were incurred in Bolivars and 30% in USD.

BF-345. Dr. Abdala objects to the use of this inflation index on the ground that it is a “consumer-level index and
the Respondents’ experts have not taken into account whether this is reflective of the cost-structure of the
Projects. According to the Respondents’ experts, this inflation index is the only one that covers the entire period

rate for 50% of their exchanges and access to the DIPRO exchange rate for

the remaining 50% of their exchanges. 135°

From 2007 to 2021, the IMF’s October 2016 forecast of inflation in Venezuela
as well as of exchange rates to convert costs from Bolivars into USD.

As regards the costs incurred in USD:

i. From 2006 to 2016, Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores adjust OPEX and CAPEX
incurred in USD based on the IHS CERA Upstream Operating Cost Index
(‘UOCI’).1357

ii. From 2007 to 2021, they use a “composite inflation index calculated as the
weighted average of: (i) expected annual changes in Brent prices, with a 15%
weight, and (ii) long-term inflation expectations of 2% per year, with an 85%

weight.”1955
With respect to costs incurred from 2022 onwards:

[I]n order to simplify the calculations and account for the currency fluctuations
and differences in inflation rates, [they] assume that purchasing power parity —
the economic principle that higher inflation rates in one country will be offset by
corrections in the exchange rate — will hold. Therefore, from 2022 forward [they]
convert all OPEX and CAPEX incurred in bolivars into U.S. dollars, based on
the IMF’s projected exchange rate in 2021; [they] then apply the composite
inflation index [to all costs] to inflate values to future years. 1959

 

(2) The Resp position on the Claii inflation and rates

Turning to Mr. Abdala’s valuation of inflation and exchange rates, the Respondents’

experts disagree with Mr. Abdala on two counts:

First, they submit that Mr. Abdala incorrectly disregards the fact that a significant
share of costs were incurred in Bolivars and not in USD and that as a consequence,
he also ignores the effect of actual inflation in Venezuela and exchange rates for the
historical period. According to the Respondents, this is fundamental error (2.1).

353

925. Second, they disagree with Mr. Abdala’s use of the US PPI as the inflation index
(2.2).

2.1. Mr. Abdala disregards actual inflation in Venezuela in the historical period

926. The Respondents’ experts explain that Mr. Abdala disregards the currency specific
projections in the 2006 Models and instead adopts the following incorrect two-step
calculation: first, he converts the costs projected in Bolivars into USD using the official
exchange rate in 2006 which was Bs. 2.15 per 1 USD;'3® and second, he then
inflates these costs — now stated in Yr. 2006 USD terms — using a US inflation index.
According to the Respondents’ experts, the flaw in this approach is that “Mr. Abdala
implicitly assumes that from 2006 forward, costs incurred in [BJolivars would have
increased at the same inflation rate as costs incurred in [USD]’, when the reality is
that between 2007 and 2015, Venezuela has experienced high inflation and such
inflation has not been offset by timely devaluations of the Bolivar vis-a-vis the
USD.1361

927. In terms of a concrete example, the Respondents’ above criticism can be illustrated

as follows:

Consider a Bs. 100 cost incurred in 2014 in Venezuela expressed in 2006
bolivars. [Mr. Abdala] would first convert this cost into U.S. dollars at the official
exchange rate as of 2006, Bs. 2.15 per US$, obtaining US$47. [He] would then
inflate this amount through 2014 using U.S. inflation, obtaining US$60. In
contrast, using actual inflation in Venezuela and exchange rates [...] the Bs.
100 cost is first inflated using actual inflation in Venezuela through 2015,
obtaining Bs. 2,251; this amount is then converted into U.S. dollars at the
official exchange rate as of 2015, Bs. 6.3 per US$, obtaining US$357. By
properly accounting for actual inflation in Venezuela and official exchange
rates, the Bs. 100 cost inflated to 2015 is six times higher than the cost
estimated using [Mr. Abdala’s] incorrect [methodology].1962

928. The Respondents submit that as a result of Mr. Abdala’s “egregious error” the costs
are grossly understated, when the reality is that costs incurred in Bolivars have ended
up being much higher, in USD terms, than originally expected in 2006. More to the

1360 Brailovsky & Flores ER |, RER-3, §§ 46-47; Petrozuata Breach Scenario Model, tab “OPEX” under “Inputs
based on: COP Composite Economic Model”, Abdala ER |, CER-3 CLEX-002.

1361 Brailovsky & Flores ER |, RER-3, §§ 46-47; The Respondents experts also provide the following example:
assume that costs incurred in bolivars in year 1 are Bs. 215. With the exchange rate equal to Bs. 2.15 per US$,
those costs translate to US$ 100. Between year 1 and year 2, inflation in Venezuela is 100%, so the costs
incurred in bolivars become Bs. 430 in year 2. If there is no devaluation of the bolivar with respect to the U.S.
dollar in year 2, then those costs in year 2 translate to US$ 200. That is, costs incurred in bolivars also double
from a U.S. dollar perspective. Inflation in the bolivar would only be irrelevant from a U.S. dollar perspective if the
bolivar had been regularly devalued in a way that would offset the high inflation in Venezuela. That was not the
case from June 26, 2007 through the Valuation Date.

point, they point out that “these cost increases have nothing to do with any perceived
inefficiencies by PDVSA, but are simply the result of inflationary forces and exchange

rate policies” .156
2.2. Mr. Abdala’s reliance on the US PPI to measure inflation is incorrect.

The second ground of disagreement is Mr. Abdala’s use of the US PPI for “Oilfield
and gas field machinery” as the appropriate inflation index. According to the
Respondents’ experts, this index measures the change in prices of machinery in USA
and while it may be used as a proxy for inflation in CAPEX when a better index does
not exist, this is not the case at present. That apart, the US PPI index is in any event
far from ideal to measure inflation in OPEX. The “obvious anomaly” resulting from
using the US PP is illustrated by the Respondents as follows:'

Next, the Respondents address the Claimants’ argument that the high inflation in
Venezuela and the lack of devaluations of the Bolivar would not have affected the
Projects because any “reasonable Project manager” would have sought to circumvent
the effects of these macroeconomic factors by (i) taking advantage of more
favourable exchange rates; (ii) reducing the exposure to high domestic inflation; or
(iii) minimizing the use of local inputs thereby minimizing costs incurred in local

currency.'%65 The Respondents experts reject Mr. Abdala’s arguments on the

following grounds:

First, that the favourable exchange rates to which Mr. Abdala refers were not
applicable to USD generated from the sale of hydrocarbons until the issuance of
Exchange Agreement No. 35 on 9 March 20169 which introduced the
DIPRO/DICOM system.'°®” For that matter, according to the Respondents’ experts
none of the exchange agreements providing for more favourable exchange rates was
applicable to the associations and permitted USD obtained from the sale of

hydrocarbons to be exchanged at such rates.

Second, to the extent such favourable rates were applicable to USD generated from
other activities, only PDVSA and its subsidiaries and empresas mixtas operating
under the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law could avail of the benefit.19® Given that in the but-
for world, the Projects would have continued as associations under the 1975
Nationalization Law, the benefits of a favourable exchange rate cannot be assumed
by the Claimants.'%6° The Respondents point out that Mr. Abdala does not address

these points.

Third, as a matter of fact, even PDVSA, its subsidiaries or empresas mixtas have not
been granted unlimited access to benefit from favourable exchange rates. They can
only do so subject to “Government evaluation of need for and availability of U.S.
dollars for the DIPRO mechanism”. Their ability to exchange more bolivars for selling
USD is subject to considerations of national economic policy, which would have been
no different in the but-for scenario. Hence, according to the Respondents, “i]t is
unreasonable and unrealistic for Dr. Abdala to assume that the Projects [...] would be
given special favorable treatment in the form of unlimited access to whatever number
of bolivars they wanted at the more favorable rates.”197°

Last, Mr. Abdala’s argument that a “reasonable manager would access the various
alternative official exchange rates, finance the Project’s operations through

intercompany or third party loans or other source, pay the Projects’ suppliers in US
dollars and hire international suppliers and pay them in US dollars outside of
Venezuela”'?”' is entirely unsubstantiated. The Respondents explain that their
calculations already account for the payment of a certain percentage of the CAPEX
and OPEX in US dollars based on the percentage of costs that would be incurred
outside of Venezuela. There is no basis to assume that further costs would have
been incurred outside Venezuela, much less that this would have been feasible.
Furthermore, most of the labour for the Projects had to be employed locally (and
therefore paid in local currency) and was protected by strong labour unions. These
could therefore not be easily ousted for outsourced labour. Finally, under the Organic
Law of Labour and Workers, there was a cap on the number of foreign employees

that could be hired and the remuneration that they could be paid.'5’2

In light of all of the above, the Respondents contend that the inflation and exchange

rates adopted by their experts is the most appropriate.
iii. The Tribunal’s determination

Having examined the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal finds that the Parties’ experts
differ as to (i) the methodology by which they have calculated the nominal value of
the Project costs, as well as (ii) the inflation and exchange rate that they have
applied.

That said, the Claimants’ expert does not oppose the Respondents’ methodology or
chosen inflation rate outright.157° Rather, according to Mr. Abdala the key issue
driving the difference in the costs calculations put forward by the Parties’ experts is
the applicable exchange rate. He states that, “[o]nce alternative legal exchange rates
are applied inflation and the relevant exchange rate move more closely together”.1574
Thus Mr. Abdala implies that once a more favourable and higher exchange rate is
applied, any discussion regarding methodology and inflation rate is rendered moot.

Producer Price Index for crude oil industrial commodities, Brailovsky and Flores use US cost inflation indices
prepared by the oil industry consultancy IHS. Both sources are reputable, and | therefore retain my assumption
based on the US PPI. Using the IHS indexes for cost inflation during the historical period would decrease my
overall damages estimate by 1.4%. [...]")

1874 Abdala ER II, CER-8, fn. 90.

357

As a consequence of this approach, most of the Claimants’ submissions center
around the selection of the appropriate exchange rate.

938. In this regard, the Claimants’ key argument is that “any reasonable project manager”
would have taken steps to avail of the most favourable exchange rates that existed in
Venezuela by financing the Projects operations through intercompany or third party
loans or other sources, paying the Projects’ suppliers in USD and hiring international
suppliers so as to pay them in USD outside Venezuela. However, having examined
the Claimants’ proposals, the Tribunal finds the Respondents’ position more

convincing.

939. First, as the Respondents correctly point out, until Exchange Agreement No. 35
issued in March 2016, none of the Exchange Agreements cited by the Claimants
applied to USD revenues earned from the sale of hydrocarbons abroad. Thus, a
favourable exchange rate would not have been applicable to USD revenues until
March 2016 at least.1975

940. Second, to the extent that favourable exchange rates were applicable to USD
generated from other activities, they were only applicable to PDVSA, its subsidiaries
and empresas mixtas. For instance, the Claimants suggest that the Projects could
have financed their operations through intercompany loans, which they claim were
eligible for more favourable exchange rates. In support of this proposal, Mr. Abdala
cites Exchange Agreement No. 24 of 2013 and Exchange Agreement No. 28 of 2014.
However, these state in relevant part as follows:

Article 1. The purchase currency exchange rate applicable [PDVSA] and its
subsidiaries, as well as to mixed companies [...] for the sale of currency
stemming from activities or operations different to those of export and/or sales
of hydrocarbons, shall be the same as the exchange resulting from the last
assignation of currencies carried out through the Complementary System of

1875 Exchange Agreement No. 35, Ministry of the Popular Power for Banking and Finance and the Central Bank of
Venezuela, Official Gazette No. 40.865, 9 March 2016, App. BF-222, Article 11 (“The sale transactions of foreign
currency by Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), its subsidiaries, and mixed companies mentioned in the

and its subsidiaries, as well as by mixed companies [...] will continue to be
subject by what is established in the Exchange Agreement No, 9 of 14 July
2009.1377

Finally, the Claimants have relied on Article 5 of Exchange Agreement No. 9 to argue
that even Associations were eligible for favorable exchange rates, both before and
after the Expropriation.'*”® Consequently, they would have been in a position to obtain
the most favourable exchange rate. However, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants’
reliance on Article 5 of Exchange Agreement No. 9 is misplaced. Article 5 provides as
follows:

Companies created by virtue of the association agreements subscribed by
Petréleos de Venezuela, S.A. under the framework of the derogated Organic
Law that Reserves to the State the Industry and Trade of Hydrocarbons, mixed
companies referred to in the Organic Law of Hydrocarbons and Organic Law of
Gas Hydrocarbons, as well as the mixed companies constituted pursuant to the
provisions of the Organic Law for the Development of Petroleum Activities, may
maintain currency accounts abroad in banking institutions or institutions of a
similar nature, by virtue of the revenues received, for the purpose of executing
corresponding payments and reimbursements outside the Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela, which shall be monitored by the Central Bank of Venezuela, who
shall issue the corresponding regulation. The remaining foreign currency,
must be sold to the Central Bank of Venezuela, at the currency exchange
rate fixed pursuant to Article 6 of the Exchange Agreement No. 1 dated
February 5, 2003.'379

Thus, quite apart from the Claimants’ interpretation, Article 5 only permits the

Associations to maintain a currency account in a foreign banking institution for the

Venezuela, Official Gazette No. 40324, 30 December 2013, CLEX-096, Article 1 (translation by the Tribunal).

purposes of holding a portion of foreign revenues that will be required for executing
corresponding payments outside Venezuela. All the remaining foreign currency has to
be sold to the Central Bank of Venezuela at the exchange rate fixed in Exchange
Agreement No. 1.

Exchange Agreement No. 9 in and of itself does not entitle the Claimants to a better
exchange rate. Rather, it points to another agreement, i.e., Exchange Agreement
No.1, which presumably sets out the exchange rate at which the Central Bank of
Venezuela will purchase USD. The Claimants’ argument that they were also entitled
to a better exchange rate thus remains unsubstantiated.

To the extent Article 5 of Exchange Agreement No. 9 allows associations to maintain
foreign currency accounts and make payments in foreign currency, the Tribunal notes
that Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores’ calculations already account for a certain
percentage of the costs being incurred in USD. In particular, they assume that the
“30% portion of OPEX and the 70% portion of CAPEX that is incurred in U.S. dollars
would have been paid in U.S. dollars, presumably with proceeds from the sale of
hydrocarbons that were kept in U.S. dollar accounts outside of Venezuela”.13®°

The Claimants have not produced any evidence to suggest that these percentages
could and should have been increased in light of Venezuelan macroeconomic factors.
To the extent they have made the proposals highlighted above, "°*' the Tribunal finds
that these are merely suggestive and the Claimants have not provided any basis to
support their assumption that had they remained with the Projects, they would have
adopted such methods to reduce costs.

Thus, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants and their expert Mr. Abdala have not
established that, but-for the Expropriation, the Associations would have been in a
position to avail of better and/or more favorable exchange rates, would have actually
done so, and that in the process the effect of Venezuelan inflation would have
become less pronounced. On balance, the Tribunal finds the Respondents’ case on
exchange rates more plausible.

Moreover, the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondents’ methodology better
reflects the real costs incurred by the Projects. In particular, the Tribunal is satisfied
with the Respondents’ use of actual inflation rates until 2015 and thereafter the IMF

projected inflation rates to determine the nominal value of costs as it considers such
data reliable.

In sum, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants have been unable to
demonstrate their case that the Projects could have availed of more favorable
exchange rates in the but-for world and that by doing so they would have overcome
the effects of high Venezuelan inflation. As such, the Tribunal finds the Respondents’
case on inflation and exchange rates more reliable and will adopt the same in its

calculations.
PosT-EXPROPRIATION FISCAL REGIME
The Claimants’ position

The Claimants’ overall contention is that “[i]t would be manifestly improper to reduce
the indemnification owed for one Discriminatory Action by hypothesizing the
application of another Discriminatory Action in the but-for world”.'2®2 In view of this,
they submit that the Income Tax Increase,'%8? the Royalty Measure, and the
Extraction Tax, are all DAs under both AAs (the latter two as part of the Overall
Expropriation).184 Thus, these measures “should be ignored in determining the
indemnification owed [by the Respondents] for [the issuance of DAs]”."3°5 In view of
this, the Claimants have instructed their quantum expert to assume that, for the
purposes of determining the ex post scenario under the DA provisions, the Projects:
“(i) pay the general corporate income tax rate of 34% (not 50%); (ii) benefit[...] from
the Royalty Reduction Agreement; and (iii) are not subject to the Extraction Tax”.15®°

Similarly, the Claimants argue that several taxation measures not applicable to the
Projects pre-Expropriation would constitute DAs if applied to both Projects in the but-
for world. 8” This is the case of:

i. The “the so-called ‘Windfall Profits Tax’ [...], also known as the ‘Special
Contribution Tax,’ introduced by the Government in 2008”;138°

ii. The “Social Contribution’ tax [of 2007], a marginal tax applicable to empresas

mixtas”,'°®° requiring the payment of “1% of [the] prior years income before

tax”: 1390

The “Shadow Tax’ [of 2007] (also known as the ‘Special Advantage Tax’),
which guarantees the Government a minimum of 50% take of the production
value of empresas mixtas”;'5°' and

iv. The Anti-Drug Contribution of 2005, consisting of a 1% tax applied to the net
income of “public or private legal entities [employing] 50 or more workers”. 1392

Therefore, the Claimants have also instructed their quantum expert to exclude the
Windfall Profits Tax, the Social Contribution and the Shadow Tax from his post-
Expropriation DA calculations.'99° Mr. Abdala further understands that the Anti-Drug
Contribution was only applicable to the Petrozuata Project and, as such, has not
included the said measure in the Hamaca Project's but-for scenario. The
Claimants endorse Mr. Abdala’s understanding. 1995

With respect to the Windfall Profits Tax in particular, the Claimants argue that, in any
event, the Projects would not have been subject to said measure. This is so given
that: (i) the “Projects would have taken advantage of one or more of the WPT’s carve-
outs and exemptions [...]";15% and (ii) “the future content or even existence of the
[Windfall Profits Tax] cannot be assumed given that it has been repealed, re-enacted,
and repeatedly amended since its arrival in 2008 [...].”19°

In this context, the Claimants refer to:

i. Article 12.2 of the Windfall Profits Tax Law, carving-out from the law’s scope
any exports to certain exempt states with which Venezuela has an
international cooperation and financing agreement. In the but-for scenario, the
Projects “could and would have modified their operations, if necessary, to

Article 12.1 of the 2011 Windfall Profits Tax Law, exempting from its scope

such “technology could and would have been implemented at both
Projects”.1999

The option of significantly reducing the Projects’ exposure to the Windfall
Profits Tax by “selling production locally in Venezuela”, considering that the
said measure “was imposed only on production sold abroad”.14°

. The possibility of reducing the Projects’ taxable base by making “royalty-in-

kind” payments, thereby reducing the Windfall Profits Tax owed by the
Projects. 140"

The fact that the Windfall Profits Tax law has been repeatedly “repealed,
replaced or amended” since its enactment, thus “rendering any assumption
about its future applicability or content [...] highly speculative”.1402

The Respondents’ document production in this arbitration, which confirmed
that “the Petropiar Project (formerly Hamaca) has not paid the WPT since
October 2013 and similarly appears to have been exempt from the WPT
between April and December 2011”.'4% In this regard, the Claimants further
note that, despite the “Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 2, and follow-up
correspondence from Claimants to Respondents on 25 May 2016,
Respondents have refused to produce the equivalent documents for PDVSA’s
other subsidiaries, including the Petroanzoategui Project (formerly
Petrozuata)”.'4°4 Hence, the Tribunal should draw the appropriate inferences,
“namely that the Projects are not subject to the [Windfall Profits Tax] post-

expropriation and, accordingly, that neither would be subject to the [Windfall
Profits Tax] in the but-for scenario”.14°

The Respondents’ position

The Respondents argue that the Claimants are wrong in assuming that they would
have “benefited from the fiscal stability they were denied in the 1990s, even though
the entire documentary record in this case shows that it was a fundamental condition
of the Congressional Authorizations that the State retained unfettered its right to take
governmental measures to capture profits generated by high oil prices”.'4°° In this
context, the Respondents highlight that the Claimants themselves have conceded
that the lack of fiscal stability of the Projects is “uncontroversial”.14°”

As such, the Projects remained “subject to governmental action [affecting] project
economics”, and there are no grounds to hypothesize that the state of affairs would
have been any different post-Expropriation.14°° To the contrary, the principle of full
reparation suggests that the correct assumption is to project a but-for scenario that
accounts for all the taxation measures applicable today in the Venezuelan oil
industry. Otherwise, the Claimants would artificially place themselves “in a better
position that they would have been in had they remained in the Projects”.'4°° The
compensation owed to the Claimants under the DA provisions “requires consideration
of all factors affecting value in applying retitutio in integrum’, including the taxation
measures not initially applicable to the Projects prior to the Expropriation.141°

With respect to the applicability of the Special Contribution or Windfall Profits Tax in
particular, the Respondents argue that the Claimants’ view that the Projects would
have qualified for exemptions is misguided. The Respondents explain their argument

as follows:14"1

In the first instance, although the applicable law provides for certain
exemptions, all such exemptions must be specifically approved in each
instance, subject to the discretion of the Ministry. [...] Claimants’ assertion that
the Projects would be granted exemptions is purely speculative, not only
because there is no indication that the associations would have engaged in any

activities for which exemptions may have been available [...], but more
significantly, because they have no explanation for presuming that discretionary
exemptions would be granted to associations or their participants when
associations were clearly a disfavored vehicle in which PDVSA subsidiaries
held minority stakes in the economic benefits of the Projects. Further,
Claimants had their own unique contractual framework created in the 1990s,
including the congressionally-approved Compensation Provisions protecting
them from governmental tax measures up to the threshold cash flow levels
specified in the Association Agreements, while permitting the Government to
reap the benefits of excess profits. Having refused to migrate to the mixed
company framework under which all companies operating in Venezuela’s
petroleum sector have conducted their activities since 2007, it defies credulity
to assume that they would have nevertheless been granted exemptions from
windfall profits taxes accorded to post-migration mixed companies, while at the
same time maintaining the structure and contractual protections they had under
the Association Agreements, particularly when that structure and those
protections had expressly been negotiated in light of the possibility of windfall
profits.

Analysis
Preliminary matters

According to Article 14.2(f) Hamaca AA, the RNCF requires the subtraction of taxes
(i.e. the “OT”, “ITR’, and “SC” variables defined in the RNCF formula) from the
Project's cash-flow.'4? Article 14.2(g) of the Hamaca AA in turn states that, for the
purposes of calculating the TCF, the foregoing variables must only account for taxes
“that did not themselves constitute [DAs]”.'4'? Consequently, insofar as the Hamaca
AA is concerned, the determination of the TCF, and thus, of the but-for scenario,

requires the exclusion of taxation measures that constitute DAs in their own right.

The Tribunal is of the view that the same conclusion must be reached with respect to
the Petrozuata AA. Unlike the Hamaca AA, the Petrozuata AA lacks a clear
contractually defined formula specifying the variables relevant to calculate the
compensation owed by the Respondents under the DA provisions.'*"4 Nonetheless, it
is common ground between the Parties’ quantum experts that, precisely for that
purpose, the fiscal regime applicable to the Petrozuata Project must be computed
along with its cash flow.'4"5 It would therefore be nonsensical to consider taxation
measures in the but-for scenario that, in and of themselves, constitute DAs in the but-
for scenario. Otherwise, the DA provisions of the Petrozuata AA would be devoid of
effet utile.

A contrario, taxation measures that cannot be characterized as DAs must remain as
relevant inputs in the determination of the ex post quantum scenario. In this context,
the Tribunal recalls its determinations that the Income Tax Increase indeed
constitutes a DA, while the Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax do not.'416

Subject to its findings on liability,'4'” the Tribunal therefore determines that the
calculation of the DA but-for scenario must assume that the Projects were not subject
to the Income Tax Increase. However, the Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax,
not being DAs, must be discounted from the Projects’ cash flow.

Further to the Parties’ submissions, the taxation measures at issue that have not yet
been subject to a determination by the Tribunal are thus the following:

i. The Ley de Contribucién Especial sobre Precios Extraordinarios del Mercado
Internacional de Hidrocarburos of 2008, referred to by the Respondents as the
Special Contribution and by the Claimants as the Windfall Profits Tax or WPT
(henceforth, “Special Contribution” or “SPEC”).'4'® The SPEC establishes a
contribution payable when crude oil prices exceed certain thresholds
established by law. For instance, when initially adopted, the SPEC essentially
required the payment of USD 0.50 for every dollar that the average price of
the Venezuela basket of crude oils found itself between USD 70 and USD 100
per barrel, and of USD 0.60 for every dollar that the price of the Venezuelan
basket exceeded USD 100 per barrel.'49 While foregoing thresholds and tax
rates (along with various other provisions of the SPEC) were amended in
2011 and 2013,'42° the implications of said amendments are not in dispute
between the Parties.

ii. The Social Contribution of 2007 (“Social Contribution” or “SOCO”). It is
common ground between the Parties’ quantum experts that the SOCO
requires the payment of 1% of the previous year’s net income before taxes for
social development programs.‘4?1 The Parties do not seem to have introduced
the text of the SOCO into the record.

964.

ili. The Special Advantage Tax of 2007, also referred to by the Claimants as the
Shadow Tax (“Special Advantage” or “SPAT”). It is common ground between
the Parties’ quantum experts that the SPAT requires the payment of “the
excess, if any, of 50%” of the value of hydrocarbons extracted “over the sum
of all royalties, taxes and contributions paid” by the Projects.'422 The Parties
do not seem to have introduced the text of the SPAT into the record.

iv. Article 96 of the Ley Organica Contra el Trafico Ilicito y el Consumo de
Sustancias Estupefacientes y Pscicotrépicas of 2005 (“Anti-Drug Contribution”
or “ADCO”). The ADCO requires all companies employing 50 or more workers
to contribute 1% of their annual net income to the prevention of trafficking and
consumption of illegal drugs. 425

The Tribunal will now assess whether, pursuant to the Parties’ submissions, the
SPEC, the SOCO, the SPAT, and/or the ADCO can be characterized as constituting
DAs under either of the AAs."424 Before doing so, however, the Tribunal must first
establish whether these existing taxation measures could have applied to the Projects
in the but-for world.

In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Respondents’ quantum experts consider
that the Adjusted Price determining the TCF finds itself below the minimum price
threshold required by the SPEC.'47° As such, they assume the SPEC would not have
applied to the Hamaca Project post-Expropriation.'4?° Similarly, Mr. Brailovksy and
Mr. Flores “do not calculate the [SPAT] in [their] compensation calculations for the
Hamaca Project, assuming that it may not have applied in a scenario where Brent oil
prices were [USD 27 in y. 1994 USD]”."427

Given that the Claimants outright exclude the application of both the SPEC and the
SPAT from their DA calculations, the Tribunal finds no reason to disagree with the
Respondents’ quantum experts: it must therefore be assumed that the Hamaca
Project would not have been subject to either the SPEC or the SPAT. The Tribunal

1424 For the sake of clarity, any determination as to the characterization of the SPEC, the SOCO, the SPAT,
and/or the ADCO as DAs or not should not be misconstrued as a decision on liability. Such a determination is
only relevant for quantum purposes in line with the DA formulae (supra, §§ 957-958).

understands that the quantum experts of both Parties already implement this

assumption in their respective valuation models.
Would the Special Contribution apply to the Projects?

The Claimants have advanced various arguments in support of their contention that,
post-Expropriation, the SPEC would not have been imposed on the Projects, or at
least not to its full extent.'428 The Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimants’ position

for the reasons expanded on below.

While it is true that Article 12.2 of the SPEC law carves out from its scope crude
exports to certain exempted states,'429 the Tribunal finds it undemonstrated that the
Claimants would have modified their operations to qualify for the said exemption. As
pointed out by the Respondents, the SPEC law does not exempt from its application
crude exports to states with which Venezuela has concluded _ international
agreements on cooperation or financing; it does not provide for a list of exempted
states either.'49° Rather, it exempts crude exported in the “implementation of
International Agreements on cooperation or financing”.143"

It very well may be that, as the Claimants note, the post-Expropriation Projects have
benefited from this SPEC exemption by exporting oil to, inter alia, China and certain
members states of the Petrocaribe Oil Alliance.'432 Nevertheless, the Claimants’ own
exhibits indicate that the said exports were, to an important extent: (i) made to repay
Venezuela’s sovereign debt or in exchange for payments in-kind (i.e. food) or other
services;"4% or (ii) subject to long-term repayment periods exceeding 20 years."454 As
phrased by the Respondents, it “hardly seems likely” and even “somewhat silly” that
the Claimants would have exported crude under these conditions.'4°>

968. The Claimants’ argument that they could have benefited from the exemption in Article
12.1 of the SPEC law by implementing EOR techniques is similarly flawed.‘4°° It is not
contentious that the implementation of EOR techniques qualifies for SPEC
exemptions under Article 12.1 of the SPEC law.'43” Indeed, the Claimants have
demonstrated that, pursuant to Article 12.1, the Ministry of Energy has granted SPEC
exemptions to post-Expropriation projects implementing “improved recovery”.'43° This
fact, however, simply corroborates that the SPEC exemption under Article 12.1 is
subject to governmental authorization; an approval that the Claimants concede is
required,'#°° and which, in the Tribunal’s view, most probably would not have been
obtained. As established elsewhere, it has not been demonstrated that the Claimants
were or would have been either in the disposition or in the capacity of implementing
EOR techniques.'44°

969. For the Tribunal, the issue of Article 12 of the SPEC law thus boils down to the
following: whether it would be acceptable for the Venezuelan Government to deny
SPEC exemptions to the Claimants on the basis that the Claimants refused to migrate
to the empresas mixtas.

970. The Respondents answer in the affirmative,'441 while the Claimants submit entirely
the opposite. In particular, the Claimants argue that denying SPEC exemptions (to
which they were arguably “entitled [...] under Venezuelan law”) on such a principled
consideration would be both “unlawful” and “discriminatory”.1442

971. The Tribunal finds it difficult to agree with the Claimants’ position. The need for
Governmental authorization for the SPEC exemptions clearly denotes a certain
degree of administrative discretion.'44 Accordingly, it cannot be accepted that the
Claimants would have been outright “entitled” to obtain the said exemptions under
Venezuelan law. Without further arguments by the Claimants in this respect, the

974.

Tribunal finds no justification to determine that the denial of SPEC exemptions on the
grounds discussed above would be “unlawful”, as broadly argued by the Claimants.

The Claimants’ submission regarding alleged discrimination fares no differently.
Beyond this general statement, the Claimants have not elaborated on why the denial
of SPEC exemptions for the reasons set out above would be discriminatory under
general Venezuelan law. If by resorting to discrimination-based arguments the
Claimants intended to refer to the DA provisions, then the Claimants conflate two
different issues. Whether the SPEC or a refusal to grant SPEC exemptions must be
deemed DAs has no bearing in the present analysis. Indeed, the Tribunal must first
determine whether the SPEC would have been applicable in the post-Expropriation’s
but-for scenario (as it is today). Only then is it apposite to ascertain whether the
SPEC or the denial of SPEC exemptions can be characterized as DAs;'444 an inquiry
that is developed further below. ‘445 Overall, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants
have failed to sufficiently demonstrate the SPEC’s inapplicability to the Projects on
the basis of the exemptions envisaged in the SPEC law.

In any event, the Tribunal cannot help but note that Article 12 of the SPEC law was
only introduced in 2011. When initially adopted in 2008, the SPEC law made no
mention to specific exemptions. Rather, it generally stated that the SPEC could “be
subject, by the National Executive Power, to total or partial exemption in benefit of
certain exports, within the framework of economic policies and_ international
cooperation”.'446 In this context, the Claimants have not provided any explanation as
to how they would have avoided the imposition of the SPEC from 2008-2011 by way
of a statutorily defined exemption.

More significantly, perhaps, the Claimants are entirely silent in terms of how they
would have actually adapted their operations to qualify for the SPEC exemptions. The
studies, details, analyses, projections or even internal estimates of the steps that the
Claimants would have concretely undertaken to benefit from the SPEC exemptions
are conspicuous for their absence. In these circumstances, a mere statement that the
Claimants would have done everything possible is, by and large, insufficient.

1446 Special Contribution 2008, App. BF-105, Article 2.

370

975. The foregoing is a recurrent problem in the Claimants’ position regarding the alleged
operational changes that would have been carried out in order to avoid their exposure
to the SPEC. The Claimants submit that they would have:

i. Sold production “locally in Venezuela” and therefore avoided the SPEC, as the
latter only applies to the export of crude.'4”7 According to the Claimants,
“PDVSA’s own records confirm that empresas mixtas—including those
producing EHCO—were designed to sell the vast majority of their production
in Venezuela, thus avoiding the imposition of [the SPEC] on these sales”.1448

ii. Reduced their SPEC taxable base by making “royalty-in-kind” payments, 1449
that is, by “putting ‘the volume of hydrocarbons extracted from any field’
towards royalties owed” (“RIK Payments”).'45° According to the Claimants, the
“Respondents’ document production in this arbitration confirms that the
Petropiar Project (formerly Hamaca) has benefited from such RIK
Payments”. 1451

976. The Tribunal cannot take the Claimants’ arguments at face value. This is so precisely
because the Claimants have not elaborated or even hypothesized on how and to
what approximate extent these operational changes could have been
implemented.1452

1451 C-PHB, § 858.

1452 R-PHB, fn. 1240 (“Finally, Claimants argue that they could have used EHCO that could not be upgraded to
pay royalties, thereby mitigating the financial effects of reduced CCO production. [...] That argument ignores a
number of points. First, the associations were “upgrading” projects, and the prohibition against blending could not
be circumvented by simply foisting non-upgraded EHCO on the Government in payment of the royalty. The fact
that a mixed company authorized to sell blended product was also directed in some circumstances to pay
royalties “in-kind” has no bearing on the issue of whether the associations could do so. Second, even if an
association had been permitted to make royalty payments “in-kind” at its option, it is unclear how such in-kind
payments would be implemented. EHCO cannot be delivered unless it is diluted with a lighter hydrocarbon that
makes it mobile in the pipeline, and therefore the Projects would need to purchase new diluent (usually naphtha)
in order for additional EHCO production at the field to be achieved. Claimants do not take into account the costs
of the naphtha or the logistics of dealing with royalty in-kind payments. Finally, Claimants and their expert are
wrong when they argue that the associations could simply have paid the royalty in-kind at their option. Under the
Hamaca Association Agreement, the parties were “required to pay to the appropriate Venezuelan authorities in
Bolivares the amount of the royalty due in respect of the Extra-Heavy Oil title to which vests in such Party
pursuant to Section 9.2.” It was only if the Ministry decided at its option to take the royalty in-kind that the royalty
could be paid in that manner”).

371

977. In any event, with respect to the possibility of selling crude within Venezuela in
particular, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants’ assumptions are inaccurate.'455
Indeed, PDVSA’s “own records” do not “confirm” that the empresas mixtas “were
designed to sell the vast majority of their production in Venezuela” (thereby avoiding
the imposition of the SPEC on those domestic sales).'4*4 The evidence relied upon by
the Claimants to make that assertion only states that an important characteristic of
the empresas mixtas model is its product placement: the extracted crude can only be
commercialized by the Venezuelan State, through PDVSA or another state entity.1455
Accordingly, the report continues, the empresas mixtas shall deliver the totality of
their hydrocarbon production of Venezuela, who will in turn sell the said production to
the customers it deems convenient.'45° Only thereafter, the empresas mixtas shall
receive payment for the production transferred in accordance with the appropriate
market price.'45” Therefore, nothing in the Claimants’ relied-upon evidence points to
the conclusion that the aforementioned “deliver[y]” of production volumes to PDVSA
amounts to a domestic sale of crude.'48 This is more so given that it appears to be
within PDVSA’s full discretion to commercialize the received production volumes
either internally or abroad.

978. In light of the above, the Tribunal determines that the SPEC must be deemed
applicable to the Projects in the but-for scenario. The Tribunal’s view remains the
same even in consideration of the Claimants’ arguments that:

i. The SPEC law has been repeatedly “repealed, replaced or amended”;"45° and

ii. Advserse inferences should be drawn given the Respondents’ failure to
produce the full set of documents showing the entitlements, by PDVSA and its
subsidiaries, to tax exemptions, exceptions, or deductions.'4°°

The Tribunal fails to see how the changes in the SPEC may affect its (in)applicability.
First, it is well within Venezuela’s prerogative as a sovereign state to repeal, replace,
or amend its legislation. Second, while the original 2008 SPEC law was repealed in
2011, this only occurred to introduce more comprehensive legislation on the
matter.'46' Since then, the SPEC law has been subjected to certain amendments
(with respect to its thresholds and rates), yet its basic structure and applicability has
never been put into question.'4©? The Claimants contend that the SPEC law may be
further amended in the future.'46? Nevertheless, such a generalized eventuality is
insufficient to exclude the SPEC from the but-for scenario. This is notably so, again,
in the absence of forecasts by the Claimants on how the SPEC could have been
imposed post-Expropriation (for instance, in accordance with their own oil price
projections).

Similarly, while it is unfortunate that the Respondents have not produced all
documents pertaining to the possible tax benefits enjoyed by PDVSA (and its
subsidiaries), it is not in itself dispositive of the issue at hand. Since the very outset
the SPEC law has envisaged the possibility of granting “total or partial exemption[s] in
benefit of certain exports, within the framework of economic policies [...]".14®4 In this
context, the Tribunal finds it unsurprising that, as alleged by the Claimants, the
PetroPiar Project appears to have been exempted from the payment of the SPEC
since 2013.46 In fact, it would not strike it as odd if the same could be said of the
Petroanzoategui Project (formerly Petrozuata).

The issue, however, is not whether the post-Expropriation projects were granted
SPEC exemptions. Rather, it is whether it can be safely assumed that the same
exemptions would have been granted to the Claimants. Nothing in the record leads to
that conclusion. To the contrary, the Respondents have been clear in their position of

favoring empresas mixtas over those hypothetically remaining entities, such as the
Claimants, that refused to adhere to the 2007 Nationalization Decree."4® It follows,
once more, that the appropriate inquiry is then to assess whether such a stand by the
Respondents is tantamount to discriminatory and unjust treatment (as defined in the
DA provisions of each AA); an analysis that is subsequent to the one regarding the
SPEC’s applicability,'4°’ and that is made infra.1468

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal confirms its determination that, at least
insofar as the Petrozuata Project is concerned,'4® the post-Expropriation’s but-for
scenario must assume that the SPEC would have applied to the Projects.

Would the Social Contribution, the Special Advantage Tax and the Anti-Drug
Contribution apply to the Projects?

The Tribunal notes that the Respondents do not seem to have adopted a position
with respect to the (in)applicability of either the SOCO and/or the SPAT. That being
said, in essence, neither have the Claimants.

Aside from instructing Mr. Abdala to exclude the SOCO and the SPAT from his DA
calculations,'4”° the Claimants have not offered a clear explanation in support of such
instruction. The Claimants appear to submit that only empresas mixtas would have
been subject to either the SOCO or the SPAT, hence implying that the Claimants
would have not, had they remained in control of the Projects.'4”1 Such a position,
however, does not withstand scrutiny.

The Tribunal recalls that the Parties do not seem to have introduced the texts of the
SOCO or the SPAT into the record.'4’? The Tribunal cannot therefore ascertain the
accuracy of the Claimants’ implied assertion. Being the interested Party in this
respect, however, the Claimants carried the burden of demonstrating why and to what
extent the SOCO or the SPAT should be deemed inapplicable in the but-for scenario;
a burden that, in these circumstances, the Claimants have failed to meet.

Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that the post-Expropriation but-for scenario must
assume that: (i) the SOCO would have been imposed to both Projects; and (ii) in line
with its previous finding in relation to the Hamaca Project,'473 the SPAT would have
been imposed to the Petrozuata Project.

Regarding the ADCO, the issue also hinges on supporting evidence or, more
precisely, the lack thereof. It is common ground between the Parties’ quantum
experts that the ADCO is applicable to public and private companies employing 50 or
more workers.'474 However, Mr. Abdala suggests that the Hamaca Project did not,
and would not have, met such a requirement.'4”5 While the Claimants themselves
endorse Mr. Abdala’s understanding, '4’° no specific submission is made to that effect,
and no evidence is referred to what would lead to such conclusion.

The same can be said of the Respondents and their quantum experts. Besides
disagreeing with Mr. Abdala’s assumption, Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores stop there:
they do not elaborate on why the ADCO did apply and would have continued to apply
to the Hamaca Project. The Respondents are equally silent on the matter.

Unlike the SOCO and the SPAT, the ADCO was originally adopted in 2005, that is,
pre-Expropriation.'47”7 Because of this, the Tribunal is of the view that the
Respondents were in a better position to demonstrate that the ADCO was indeed
imposed on the Hamaca Project up to the Expropriation. Given that the Respondents
have failed to discharge their burden of proof, however, the Tribunal cannot but
accept the Claimants’ assumption that the Hamaca Project was not subject to the
ADCO between 2005 and 2007. By consequence, the same must be projected post-
Expropriation. The Tribunal therefore determines that, in the but-for scenario, the
ADCO must be deemed inapplicable to the Hamaca Project.

. Are any of the applicable taxation measures DAs?

The Tribunal has already found that the SPEC is not applicable to the Hamaca
Project and therefore it does not need to determine whether it amounts to a DA under

the Hamaca AA."478 That being said, as developed further below, it is clear to the
Tribunal that the SPEC is not “discriminatory” in accordance with the DA provisions of
the Petrozuata AA. This is so given that the Claimants have not applied the correct
comparator.

The Claimants argue that the imposition of the SPEC must be excluded from the but-
for scenario given that it constitutes “a [DA] in its own right”.'47° According to the
Claimants, this is so because “it applies only to certain hydrocarbon-producing
entities rather than to corporations generally”.'4°° This is the only argument put
forward by the Claimants. The Tribunal notes that the Respondents do not raise a
specific argument with respect to the SPEC. However, the Tribunal recalls the
Respondents’ position in relation to the Income Tax Increase, which is equally
applicable here. According to the Respondents, the issue turns on the meaning of
what constitutes a generally applicable taxation measures: ‘“[i]f the [measures are]
generally applicable because they appl[y] to any tax payer engaging in the oil
business, then they cannot be a [DA]’."48' Albeit in the context of the Claimants’
Willful Breach Claim, the Respondents further argue that “there is nothing wrong with
having different fiscal regimes for companies that are not similarly situated”.1482 The
Tribunal generally agrees.

Section 1.01 of the Petrozuata AA establishes a default comparator for the purposes
of determining whether a particular qualified measure is discriminatory, namely, a
measure whose “treatment” is not “applicable to all enterprises in Venezuela”.'485
However, as analyzed elsewhere in this award,'484 Section 1.01 subsequently
contemplates a first carve-out to the foregoing default comparator. This first carve-out
states that “treatment shall not be considered discriminatory if it equally applies to the
enterprises (empresas) within the oil industry in Venezuela” .14®5

Being a taxation measure applicable to all private, mixed and public entities, and
imposed on the export of crude oil and by-products, ‘48° the SPEC must be deemed to
“equally appl[y] to the enterprises [...] within the oil industry in Venezuela” deciding to
undertake export activities. Because of this, the SPEC cannot be characterized as a
discriminatory qualified measure under the Petrozuata AA and, therefore, as a DA.

The same goes for the Claimants’ arguments that the denial of SPEC exemptions
would amount to discriminatory treatment.'4°” First, the Claimants do not develop their
contention that an intentional denial of SPEC exemptions would have constituted a
DA under the AAs. For instance, the Claimants fail to categorize administrative
decisions denying tax exemptions as qualified measures falling under the purview of
the relevant DA provisions of either AA.'48 Assuming they do, however, the
Claimants in any event merely make general statements as to how a denial of SPEC
exemptions to the Projects would be “discriminatory”."4®° The Claimants do not refer
to the DA provisions of the AAs and, as such, offer no contractual basis for their
statements.

Second, the Respondents’ position is clear: the granting of SPEC exemptions to
empresas mixtas, as opposed to the Claimants, would have ultimately been
determined by a policy to accord more favorable treatment to the former.'4°° In this
context, the Tribunal cannot help but note that the Petrozuata AA specifically provides
that “if special favorable treatment applicable only to the government owned
companies is adopted, such treatment shall not be considered per se
discriminatory”.49"

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal determines that it would run contrary to
the explicit text of the Petrozuata AA to characterize, either the SPEC itself, or the
eventual refusal to grant SPEC exemptions to the Claimants, as DAs. Therefore, the
SPEC cannot be excluded from the but-for scenario and must be discounted from the
cash flows that the Petrozuata Project would have generated had the Expropriation
not taken place.

With respect to the SOCO and the SPAT, the issue is straightforward: the Claimants
limit their argument to stating that “[t]hese taxes would also be [DAs], as defined in
the AAs, and should be excluded for that reason”.'49? The relevant comparator under

either AA is not identified nor the scope of each qualified measure is considered.

In short, the Claimants provide no elements for the Tribunal to assess whether, in
fact, the SOCO and the SPAT are discriminatory in accordance with the contractual
provisions of the Petrozuata and Hamaca AAs. In view of this, the Tribunal
determines that neither of these measures can be deemed DAs and must therefore

be duly accounted for in the but-for scenario.
INTEREST

It is common ground between the Parties that, with respect to the Claimants’ DA
Claim, each AA sets out the applicable interest rate in order to bring the lost historical
cash flows forward to present value (i.e. the date of valuation, namely, 27 May
2016).1495 The Petrozuata AA establishes a “Base Rate” interest of 12-month
LIBOR.*4°4 The Hamaca AA in turn establishes a 3-month LIBOR interest rate to the
same effect.149

The issue in contention is whether the aforementioned rates must be granted on a
compounded interest basis, as argued by the Claimants,’4°° or on a simple interest
basis, as argued by the Respondents. 149”

According to the Claimants, Venezuelan law “permits the award of compound
interest’,'49° which “reflects [the] economic reality [of] modern times”.'4°° To support
their argument the Claimants rely, chiefly, on investment arbitration awards,'*°° on the

ConocoPhillips OPEC award,'%' on a decision rendered by the Venezuelan Superior
Court for Civil, Banking and Commercial Matters,'°° and on their legal expert, Prof.

Mata Borjas. In particular, Prof. Mata Borjas states the following:

Venezuelan law provides for pre- and post-award compound interest except in a
small number of exceptional circumstances—such as credit card and home
mortgage laws—that do not apply here. Compound interest is also payable by
mutual agreement or by judicial decision. [...] Venezuelan jurisprudence [...]
recognizes the award of compound interest pursuant to Article 530. Further,
principles of full reparation under Venezuelan law require compound interest to
be awarded to an injured party, to offset all of the losses caused by the wrongful
conduct. 1503
In this regard, the Claimants argue that the foregoing denotes the “appropriateness of
compound interest”."5°4 They therefore submit: “all capitalization or interest awarded

to Claimants should be subject to reasonable compounding”.15°5

The Respondents, on the other hand, submit that, pursuant to Article 530 of the
Venezuelan Commercial Code (“VCoC”),5°° Venezuelan law allows compounding
only in the two following situations: “(i) when the parties enter into an express
agreement to capitalize interest after the interest has already been quantified, or (ii)
when a judgment is rendered including interest, in which case interest will accrue on
the entire amount of the judgment from the date of the judgment”."5°” According to the
Respondents, neither of these two situations applies to the case at hand, and
therefore only simple interest can be awarded.'®°° The Respondents notably rely on
the reports of their legal expert, Prof. Garcia Montoya and the authorities cited

therein.15°9

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondents. First, the Tribunal finds that the
investment arbitration awards relied upon by the Claimants are of no bearing to the
present issue. As acknowledged by the Claimants themselves, the lodestar is

whether “Venezuelan law [...] restrict[s] the Tribunal’s power to award compound
interest’.'5"° Whether or not investment arbitration tribunals, applying international
law, grant compounded interests, is of little relevance.

1005. Second, the Tribunal finds little guidance in the ConocoPhillips OPEC award. In their
decision, the tribunal reasoned as follows:

Claimants have requested the application of compound interests based on the
main reasons that only compound interest would be in accordance with the
principle of full compensation of damages, and that failure to grant compound
interest would represent an unwarranted departure from current arbitral
practice. In addition, neither Venezuelan law nor the ICC Rules would in any
way fetter the Arbitral Tribunal's discretion in this regard.

Respondent has not challenged Claimants' request for compound interests, nor
has it objected to Claimant's calculation of such compound interest.

[el

After discussing the appropriateness of compound interest as calculated by Mr.
Manuel Abdala, the majority of the Arbitral Tribunal found no justifiable reason
to depart from the calculation method he adopted.15"

1006. The Tribunal thus notes that, contrary to the present case, the OPEC tribunal did not
deal with a challenge by the responding party to the recognition of compound interest.
It is perhaps for that reason that the content of Article 530 of the VCoC does not
seem to have been properly considered. In this context, the OPEC tribunal’s
conclusion that Venezuelan law did not fetter its discretion to grant compound interest
is, at best, of limited assistance.

1007. It follows that, as far as supporting authorities on domestic law are concerned, the
Claimants’ compound interest argument hinges on the Banco Latino case decided by
the Venezuelan Superior Court for Civil, Banking and Commercial Matters.'5'? This

case, however, runs in favor of the Respondents’ position.

1008. While in Banco Latino the Court recognized the applicability of compound interest
under Venezuelan law, it did so within the framework of Article 530 of the VCoC,
which states as follows:

Interest is not owed on interest as long as, after its calculation, it is not included
in a new contract as a capital increase. It is also owed when by mutual

1512 Supra, fn. 1502.

380

agreement, or by judicial decision, the balance is calculated including therein
the accrued interest.'5"9
1009. As rightly pointed out by Prof. Garcia Montoya, in Banco Latino the Court sanctioned

compounded interest given that the parties had “mutually agreed to capitalize
interest, and these were included in a new loan agreement, in accordance with the
requirements of [the first tranche of] Article 530 of the Commercial Code”."5'4 The
factual considerations determining Banco Latino therefore correspond with the first of
two situations mentioned above which, according to the Respondents, are the only
scenarios whereby Venezuelan law allows compounding.'*'> In this regard, the
Tribunal agrees with the Respondents that “Banco Latino does not support [the]
Claimants’ argument that compound interest should be awarded in this case, where
the parties have not mutually agreed to compound interest”."5"¢

1010. Prof. Mata Borjas’ expert opinion does little to advance the Claimants’ position on this
point. In his first expert report Prof. Mata Borjas is silent on the matter of compound
interest. It is only in his second expert report that Prof. Mata Borjas argues in favor of
granting compound interest in light of: (i) Article 530 of the VCoC; and (ii) the
principles of full compensation."5'” Nevertheless:

i. When referring to how Venezuelan case law “recognizes the award of
compound interest pursuant to Article 530” of the VCoC, the only authority
given to that effect is precisely the Banco Latino case.'5'® As seen, however,
Banco Latino is not favorable to the Claimants.

ii. No authority is provided accounting for the relevance of the principles of full
compensation as grounds for granting compound interests, and rightly so:
during the Hearing, Prof. Mata Borjas conceded that, as opposed to general
principles of compensation, the “only legal basis that exists in Venezuela for

1513 VCoC, RLA-123, Article 530 (“No se deben intereses sobre intereses mientras que, hecha la liquidacién de

compound interest” is Article 530 of the VCoC.'5'° In any event, the Tribunal
agrees with Prof. Garcia Montoya that reliance on general principles with
respect to interest seems incorrect. Indeed, the “criteria regarding compound
interest” held by the Venezuelan Supreme Court appears to “take precedence
over any argument regarding its applicability under the principle of integral
teparation”.'°2° In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Respondents refer
to at least two decisions by the Supreme Court suggesting that compounding
interest is only permitted in the context of Article 530 of the VCoC;'521
decisions whose relevance to the Respondents’ case against compounded
interest has not been questioned by the Claimants.

1011. Prof. Mata Borjas further submits that compound interests can also be “payable by
[...] judicial decision”."52? The Tribunal understands this to be a reference to the
second tranche of Article 530 of the VCoC."®?3 Yet, the Tribunal again fails to see the
relevance of that provision in the case at hand.

1012. It is undisputed that Article 530 of the VCoC envisages two situations whereby
compound interest is permitted under Venezuelan law, the second one of which is
through a judicial decision ordering so.1*4 Presumably, the same can be said of an
arbitral award. Still, as explained by Prof. Garcia Montoya, that can only occur when
“pre-judgment[/award] interest is included within the amount of the judgment[/award],

1519 Tr, (Day 7) 1916:18-25 — 1927:1 (Mata Borjas). While Article 530 of the VCoC in principle only applies to

Prof. Garcia Montoya’s foregoing explanation is not controversial. Indeed, during the
Hearing, Prof. Mata Borjas acknowledged that a judgement/award can allow for
compound interests only after the pre-judgement/award interests are deemed
matured and incorporated as a principal amount in the said judgement or award.'526
That, however, is not the Claimants’ position in this arbitration. The Claimants very
clearly request that “all capitalization or interest awarded”, including those relating to
historical cash flows, “should be subject to reasonable compounding [...] on an

annual basis”.1527

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal is of the view that, under Venezuelan law,
compound interest cannot be awarded in the present case. The Tribunal therefore
determines that, pursuant to the Parties’ agreement with respect to the interest rates
applicable to the DA Claim, "5? the Hamaca Project's historical yearly indemnifications
accrue simple interest quarterly at 3-month LIBOR rate, while the Petrozuata Project’s
historical annual indemnifications accrue simple interest annually at 12-month
LIBOR.1529

DISCOUNT RATE
The Claimants’ position

In order to bring future cash flows pertaining to the DA Claim back to present value
(i.e., the date of valuation, namely, 27 May 2016),'®*° the Claimants argue in favor of
adopting a discount rate of 15.2%. The Claimants arrive at this figure by using the
following International Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) “building blocks”
approach:1531

i. Establishing a base line risk-free rate of 2.11%;

ii. Computing a 6.22% risk-factor reflecting the risks associated with an equity
investment in the upstream crude oil industry in a developed economy like the
United States (i.e., industry risk premium) which, multiplied by an unlevered
beta of 1.13 and added to the risk-free rate, yields an unlevered cost of equity
for a U.S.-based upstream oil and gas project of 7%; and

Applying a country risk premium of 6.1% to reflect the country-specific (i.e.,
Venezuela) risks to which the Projects would have been exposed in the but-for
world.

The Claimants justify the foregoing unlevered cost of equity approach (“unlevered
CoE”) as opposed to a weighted average cost of capital approach (“WACC’). They
argue that “the indemnification amounts owing under the DA provisions are properly
characterized as cash flows to equity holders, meaning that the discount rates for the
DA provisions scenarios are based on the Projects’ cost of equity, rather than the
weighted average of the cost of equity and cost of debt, as reflected in the
WACC”.1582

In view of this, the Claimants submit that their discount rate of 15.21% is reasonable,
as it is consistent with: “(i) the rates used by the Project participants and their affiliates
throughout their relationship; and (ii) the rates Respondents apply to their other
hydrocarbon projects in Venezuela today”."5%?

Regarding the former, the Claimants refer to a report prepared by the Petrozuata
Project of January 2000,'*** and a Financing Memorandum prepared by the Hamaca
Project in August 2000,'%°° calculating a discount rate of 8.53% and 10% respectively.
The Claimants also refer to a 2008 “document that Venezuela was compelled to
produce in the ICSID Arbitration, [...] bear[ing] the logos of PDVSA, the Government
and the Ministry, [and] propos[ing] a discount rate range of 8% to 12% to value th[e]
Projects”.15°6 According to the Claimants, the said range was calculated during the
negotiations regarding the Expropriation, i.e., at a time when the “Respondents’

the Willful Breach scenario, which results in a discount rate of 13.8% (C-PHB, § 875, fn. 1581).

incentive was to use as high a discount rate as possible to reduce the Projects’

value” .1597

1019. With respect to the alleged rates the Respondents currently apply to their other
hydrocarbon projects in Venezuela, the Claimants refer to: (i) the 10% discount rate
set in the 2008-2014 annual Consolidated Financial Statements for PDVSA and its
subsidiaries; 1° (ii) a discount rate of 8% determined in 2014 in the context of a
greenfield and thus riskier project between PDVSA and foreign investors Eni and
Repsol;'5° and (iii) the 10% discount rate associated with the underdeveloped
greenfield Junin 4 Block project also in the Orinoco Belt. This last project, the
Claimants submit, is the product of a treaty between Venezuela and China to be
developed through a joint venture between PDVSA and the Chinese National
Petroleum Corporation (“CNPC”).154°

1020. The Claimants further argue that their discount is also consistent with those adopted
in other arbitration awards in comparable cases,'“' such as Occidental Petroleum
(applying a 12% discount rate),'°42 Enron (applying a 12.6% discount rate),'543 and
Gold Reserve (applying a discount rate of 10.09%). 1544

1021. In view of the Respondents’ proposed 27.7% discount rate,'*45 the Claimants note
that such an “absurdly high” rate results from the miscalculation of their country risk
premium, which is premised on the following three main interrelated errors:'546

i. First, the Respondents’ quantum experts incorrectly consider the current near-
default status of Venezuela’s sovereign debt as a factor in the determination

of the applicable country risk. According to the Claimants, this is misguided for
the following two reasons. On the one hand, by “anchoring] their country risk
premium on the [...] present-day borrowing costs of the Venezuelan
government”, the Respondents perform an “actual” analysis as opposed to a
“put-for analysis”.'*4” On the other hand, there is little to no relation between
the risk of Venezuela defaulting on its financial sovereign obligations and the
country risk assignable to private, profitable, and financially stable commercial
enterprises such as the Projects. While the Venezuela’s 23% bond yield
suggests market expectations that it will soon default on its loans, the
Claimants refer to their quantum expert and assert that “the Projects were not,
and have not been, anywhere close to near-default status. [T]he measure of
the distress experienced by Venezuela, and reflected in the [sovereign debt
spread], is not useful as a proxy to derive a country risk premium for the
Projects”.1548

Second, the Respondents improperly “inflate” their country risk premium by
accounting for Venezuela’s “propensity to engage in types of unlawful conduct
that are the subject of this arbitration’.‘9 According to the Claimants,
Venezuela attempted the same “gambit” in Gold Reserve,'*®° where the
tribunal rightfully found that it was “inappropriate to increase the country risk
premium to reflect the market's perception that a State might have a
propensity to expropriate investments in breach of BIT obligations.’ The
Claimants submit that holding otherwise would “reward violations of
international law, and create an incentive for a State (or state companies
acting in collusion with it) to take property in violation of its international
obligations”;'*°? a result that would be “irreconcilable with the basic principle
that a party may not benefit from its wrongful conduct”.1553

The Claimants distinguish Gold Reserve from other decisions relied upon by
the Respondents, such as Tidewater and Saint-Gobain.'** In particular, the

Claimants submit that, Gold Reserve, unlike Tidewater and Saint-Gobain,
concerned a confirmed unlawful expropriation of assets that had been
invested in Venezuela during non-suspect times (i.e. in the mid-1990s, before
the political and legal uncertainties associated with the ascendency of the
Chavez government). "555 Accordingly, it is Gold Reserve, and not Tidewater or
Saint-Gobain, which serves as proper guidance to the Tribunal.

Third, the Respondents’ discount rate fails to account for the limited exposure
of the Projects to the Venezuelan country risk. For instance, it ignores that the
Projects: “(i) produced a commodity for which there is international demand;
(ii) sold their products, and received their income, abroad in U.S. dollars; (iii)
acquired critical inputs from international markets; (iv) used little local capital;
(v) relied on infrastructure that was self-contained and largely insulated from
local unrest or disruptions; and (vi) had legal protections designed to reduce
their exposure to adverse governmental actions”.155°

1022. Furthermore, the Claimants submit that the Respondents’ discount rate calculations

are premised on the following out-of-context statements. In particular:

The Respondents point to documents allegedly indicating that the Claimants
have envisaged high discount with respect to the Projects themselves or other
unspecified projects, such as the 20% rate identified by Mr. Robert McKee
(former Conoco’s Executive Vice President for Exploration and Production) at
the time Conoco decided to participate in the Petrozuata Project in the mid-
1990s,'°5” and by Mr. Matthew Fox (who held the same position that had been
held by Mr. McKee) in 2013 with respect to projects in Canada.5* However,
those rates in fact corresponded to an internal rate of return (“IRR”), which
serves a distinct purpose. 15°?

Venezuela’s damages experts at Econ One during the merits phase of the
ICSID Arbitration, identified certain rates in relation to a 3640-mile pipeline to
transport natural gas from Alaska to Chicago. In particular, the Respondents
stress that in Ms. Kah’s opinion 12% would be an appropriate discount rate for
“energy projects in the United States”; a figure that she considered would be
“higher” elsewhere due to the “risks involved”.'6° The Respondents also
highlight Dr. Finizza’s opinion that a 25% discount rate would be appropriate
for projects in Venezuela,‘ meaning that an investor would require a
threshold IRR above said “risk-premium” to invest in Venezuela.1562 However,
in the Claimants’ view the pipeline discussed before the Alaskan State
Legislature (which has not yet been built) is not comparable with either of the
Projects because, in addition to being a different class of project, it concerned
the "largest, most technically complex and most expensive construction
projects in the world, and thus one of the riskiest’.15°° The Claimants also
argue that Dr. Finizza’s comments are inapposite as, “[a]t most, they stand for
the unremarkable proposition that a project in Venezuela faces higher country
tisk than would an identical project in the United States”.156

The Respondents refer to an expert report submitted by ConocoPhillips in a
commercial ICC arbitration against PDVSA, PDVSA Petrdleo, and PDVSA
subsidiaries, proposing a discount rate between 20% and 30% with respect to
the valuation of an oil refinery in Texas.'5®° However, as a procedural matter,
the Claimants “object to Respondents’ introduction of that expert report—
which has been sealed by a U.S. Federal Court in a case in which affiliates of
PDVSA, represented by Curtis Mallet, are involved—into this proceeding, and
renew their request that it be struck from the record”.156 In any event, the

were captured within a large refinery complex that the joint venture did not
own”, making it “essentially unmarketable to third parties”. °°”

iv. The Respondents rely on the Himpurna,'5® Lemire,'5°° and both the Mobil
ICC'8 and Mobil ICSID'*" cases, applying discount rates of about 18%.
However, neither of these decisions should guide the Tribunal given that, inter
alia, said cases either: (i) entailed particular factual circumstances not
applicable to the case at hand; (ii) concerned nascent and/or greenfield
projects that were thus exposed to higher operational and construction risks;
(iii) confused the notion of IRR with that of discount rate; or (iv) based their
discount rate calculation on the project's CoE as opposed to the project's
WACC, which generally yields a higher discount rate; (v) were confronted with
what was deemed unreasonable discount rate proposals by the respective
claimants, and therefore left with no alternative but to adopt the high discount
rate submitted by the respondents; (vi) did not undertake an independent
analysis of the applicable discount rate in order to avoid inconsistent
outcomes between similar cases; and/or (vii) rendered their decision in the
context of a lawful expropriation.1572

Respondents and their quantum experts argue in favor of a WACC or discount rate
for the DA scenario of 27.7%.'5” They arrive at this figure by:1575

i. Establishing a base line 2.1% risk-free rate;
ii. Computing a 5.8% industry risk premium;
iii. Adding a 17.8% country risk premium;

1024. Supplementing the above figures with a 2.0% liquidity premium accounting for an
estimate discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM’).

1025. The Respondents opt for a WACC approach, as opposed to an unlevered CoE
analysis, given their disagreement with the Claimants’ assumption that, under the DA
provisions, “the yearly indemnification amounts owing to Claimants are tantamount to
a stream of equity cash flows to Claimants, which ought to be paid by the state-
owned equity holder in each Project’.'5”° According to the Respondents’ quantum
experts, the valuation with respect to the AAs (be it under the Willful Breach Claim or
the DA Claim) must respond to the “correct fair market value of the projects” vis-a-vis
any “prospective arm’s-length buyer of the Projects”."5’” Hence, as far as the discount
rate applicable to future cash flows is concerned, there are no reasons to make
distinctions between the Willful Breach and DA scenarios.

1026. In light of the above, the Respondents contend that their 27.7% discount rate is
appropriate, as the only one consistent with: (i) “those of other tribunals in cases
involving the very same nationalization as is at issue here;19”8 (ii) the relation between
the notions of IRR and discount rate;"5”° and (iii) the statements made by Claimants’

1574 R-PHB, § 822; Brailovsky/Flores ICSID Consolidated Report, App. BF-406, § 347.

11 “may not add to total due to rounding” (Brailovsky/Flores ICSID Consolidated Report, App. BF-406, fn. 774).
Indeed, Figure 11 refers to a 2.1% risk-free rate, a 5.7% industry risk premium, a 17.8% country risk premium,
and a 2.0% liquidity premium, which adds to a discount rate of 27.6%, not 27.7%. Given that Mr. Brailovsky and
Mr. Flores do not seem to disaggregate their 27.7% discount rate into the same categories elsewhere in their
Consolidated ICSID Report, for the sake of consistency the Tribunal refers to a 5.8% industry risk premium as
opposed to the 5.7% industry risk premium as in Figure 11. This adjustment in any event has no bearing on the
Tribunals final determination on discount rate. This is so because, save for certain exceptions (infra, § 1051), the
Tribunal shall decide on the applicable discount rate as a whole (infra, § 1052).

own representatives and the positions taken by Claimants, their experts and their
counsel in other proceedings”.15°°

In relation to the first point, the Respondents rely, chiefly, on the Mobil ICC and ICS/D
cases (both adopting a discount rate of 18%),'°°' Tidewater (considering a country
risk premium of 14.75% to be “reasonable” and “conservative” for Venezuela in
2009),*5® and Saint-Gobain (setting a nominal discount rate of 19.88%).15°

In particular, the Respondents contend that it is indeed appropriate to calculate a
country risk premium commensurate to the political risk of doing business in a
particular state — an analysis that may entail a but-for scenario accounting for the risk
of being expropriated. Such an approach, the Respondents submit, must not be
misconstrued as allowing States to benefit from their own wrongdoing, it simply
represents the assessment that a hypothetical buyer would undertake when
determining the amount it would be willing to pay for the asset in question at a
particular point in time.'5®4 The consideration of expropriation risk thus responds to an
economic question that is distinct from that of liability resulting from the issuance of
certain State measures. 15°

With respect to the Claimants’ attempt to differentiate between the notions of IRR and
discount rate, the Respondents submit that “it is elementary that the minimum
expected IRR or “hurdle rate” that an investor requires in order to invest in a project is
precisely equivalent to the discount rate”.15°° According to the Respondents, the
“connection between minimum IRR or hurdle rate, on the one hand, and discount
tate, on the other, [...] is also well established in all literature on the subject”.15°”

In this context, the Respondents submit that it is “insultin[g]” for the Claimants to
argue that the CC Mobil tribunal misunderstood the distinction between discount rate

and IRR.1588 Referring to the position adopted by Venezuela in the ICSID Arbitration,
the Respondents argue:

First, Claimants criticize the ICC tribunal, consisting of three distinguished and
experienced international arbitrators, for not understanding the discount rate
issue, but the fact is that the tribunal had before it the extensive expert reports
and live testimony of four accomplished discount rate experts, including
Respondent's two experts in this case, and understood the issue quite well.
Claimants, on the other hand, can only fall back on their mantra of “full
compensation” under Chorzéw Factory, which says nothing about what an
appropriate discount rate to arrive at full compensation would be in this case.
Claimants are the ones who misunderstand what the ICC tribunal was doing,
which obviously was to select a discount rate to obtain the present value of
future cash flows, exactly the exercise that this Tribunal would be performing if
the claim for compensation for the 2007 nationalization were to survive the
jurisdictional objections.

Claimants confuse a number of concepts, including IRR [internal rate of return]
and hurdle rate, ignoring their relationship to the concept of market value and
the basic issue of how a “willing buyer” would go about calculating the amount it
would be willing to pay in an acquisition of an oil property of the type at issue in
this case. The actual IRR of a particular project is not, as Claimants seem to
think, what the ICC tribunal relied on. Nor is it what we have argued in this case.
But the minimum expected IRR a buyer would demand in determining whether
to enter into the project, also known as the “hurdle rate”, is of course relevant.
As all the dictionary definitions of hurdle rate make clear, if a project is not
expected to yield an IRR at least equal to the hurdle rate, the company will not
invest. One is supposed to jump over a hurdle, not crawl underneath. While
Claimants repeatedly refer to what a willing buyer would do, they have never
been able to explain why a willing buyer would be willing to pay anything to
invest in a project that yields a return less than the minimum return it requires.

Our experts referred to historical profitability as one of four submethods of
calculating a discount rate, all of which ended up in the 16.3 to 22.5% range,
with the historical submethod actually yielding the lowest rate. If our experts had
taken only the latter, the recommended discount rate would have been 21.7%
instead of 19.8%. The relevance of the historical data was to show the kind of
returns that companies in the industry, including these Claimants, expect from
their projects, which is relevant in determining the hurdle rate prospective
buyers would likely use in deciding whether to invest in the projects at issue in
this case. [...]'58°

1031. The Respondents further argue that the Claimants’ own representatives understood
well the reciprocity between these two concepts when making various statements
unfavorable to the Claimants’ proposed discount rate.'5°° In this regard, the
Respondents point to how Mr. McKee acknowledged that Conoco’s hurdle rate for the
Petrozuata Project was 20%:

[W]hen this Project was approved, as | recall, it was approved at about a 20
percent IRR, which is about the minimum that | or the DuPont Board or Conoco
or other Conoco Management would have tolerated for an investment this large,
so concentrated, and in the place where it was, in the products, the business
products that we were going. [...] [T]hat is more or less the hurdle rate we would
demand for a project that has this degree of variable risk attached to it.15%"

1032. The Respondents submit that Mr. McKee’s understanding that there is indeed a
relation between the notions of IRR and discount rate was confirmed by Mr. Jeff
Sheets (“another senior executive testifying for the ICSID Claimants”),'5°* who stated
the following:

Q. Okay. I’m confused by this notion of IRR in relationship with the discount
rate. Help me out on this. Are you telling this Tribunal that there is no
relationship between what we call in the industry a “hurdle rate” and the
discount rate? Is that what your testimony is?

A. No, | think there is — when we do a project evaluation, we will look at all the
information that we have; and, if we are making a capital investment, we will
determine what kind of return we would get on that capital investment, and
that’s what we refer to as the “internal rate of return.”

Q. Okay. Mr. McKee was saying that he would demand, as a minimum, a 20
percent return in order to buy into this Project, let’s say; is that fair?

A. That's what his testimony says.

Q. That's what his testimony says. Now, if this Tribunal were to use a 10
percent discount rate, it would come up, if it ever got to that point, with a higher
value than if you would use a 19 percent discount rate; isn’t that correct?

A. That's correct. 1993

1033. According to the Respondents, Mr. Fox took a similar view when, in his capacity as
Conoco’s Executive Vice President for Exploration and Production in 2013, he
referred to the “rate of return for unconventional oil programs in Western Canada”, 15%
stating: “[a]ll of these projects have rates of return above 20%. We're not going to
invest in them unless they do”.5°5 For the Respondents, were the foregoing projects

in Venezuela, “the country risk premium would drive the discount rate to be used in
project evaluation considerably higher”.1°°°

The Respondents further point to a presentation published by Moyes & Co., whose
president, Mr. Christopher Moyes, appeared as “one of the ICSID Claimants’
experts”.'59” In its presentation, Moyes & Co indicates that the oil industry “appear[s]
to accept that a 20-30% Expected Rate of Return in Acceptable”.15°°

The Respondents also rely on the declarations made by Ms. Kah and Dr. Finizza
during a 2006 public hearing of the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee of the
Alaska State Legislature. In particular, the Respondents point to how, in his 2005
presentation prior to the public hearing, Dr. Finizza:

[...] started by explaining that “[p]rojects need to be evaluated at the risk-
adjusted cost of capital, which may be above the Weighted Average Cost of
Capital,” and that a project is made riskier by “Uncertainty,” “Political risk” and
“Economic risk.” He went on to distinguish between the expected IRR of a
project and the “threshold rate of return” required to undertake an investment
(or the “hurdle rate”), and explained that a threshold rate of return of 12% to
15% would be appropriate for a project that was “without significant risk
factors.” Dr. Finizza then referred to discount rates that would have been
appropriate as of 2005 for hypothetical projects in various countries, and stated
that a 25% discount rate would be appropriate for an oil project in
Venezuela. "599

The Respondents then refer to Dr. Finizza’s responses during the examination of his
presentation before the Alaska State Legislature, where he confirmed “his view that
the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate for an oil project in Venezuela in 2005
would be 25%, meaning that an investor would require a premium above the rate of
return required in less risky countries to invest in Venezuela”.1°°

Turning to Ms. Kah’s declarations during the same public hearing, the Respondents
submit that her view confirms that a 12% to 15% IRR would be necessary for an
energy project in the United States. As such, “[flor a project in a developing economy
with a country risk rating like that of Venezuela, the required return would be much

higher, which was precisely the point of Dr. Finizza’s presentation [...].1%' In
particular, Ms. Kah opined:

First | wanted to say that companies really do look at a range of measures; we
don't look at one measure. And IRR is a very important measure that we take
very seriously[...]. So it's very important that we look at return on capital
employ[ed] and make sure we don't invest in a project that will have such a low
return that it will dilute our return on capital employed. We also, of course, do
look at net present value. [...] Our industry doesn’t necessarily use the 10

percent discount rate. And | think you even presented some material yesterday

indicating that a U.S. risk discount rate was more like 12 percent, and that’s for

the U.S. in general. If you looked at the energy industry it would probably be

higher than that in terms of the risk involved in energy projects in the United

States. 1602

1038. In any event, the Respondents offer evidence directly discussing the issue of discount

rate allegedly in support of their now proposed 27.7% discount rate, such as: (i) a
table produced by IHS Global Insight, “a well-known consulting firm in the oil
industry”, '°°> calculating discount rates adjusted for country risk in Venezuela ranging
between 20.30% (in 2005) and 22.79%(in 2009);'° and (ii) the Merey Sweeney
report, involving the valuation of a refinery in Texas, in which the ConocoPhillips
expert argued for a discount rate between 20% and 30%.'®°5 In these circumstances,
“if this Tribunal were simply to take the average of the discount rates — or “hurdle
rates” — proposed by ConocoPhillips and its experts for oil projects and adjust them to
the Projects in Venezuela, it would be using a discount rate at or higher than the level
proposed by Respondents’ experts, and that would be even including the indefensibly
low discount rate of Claimants’ expert here in the average”.166

1039. With respect to relevant case law, the Respondents contend that, contrary to the
Claimants’ allegations, the Mobil ICC tribunal had other alternatives than to simply
“accept the respondents’ proposed rate because the claimant had been [...]

unreasonable” in that regard.'®°” Referring to their position in the ICSID Arbitration,

the Respondents submit:

Perhaps the most remarkable argument Claimants make about the Mobil [ICC]
case is that the tribunal selected the lowest of three rates proposed by
respondents there because the rate proposed by Mobil was so low as to be
unacceptable and the tribunal felt it had no choice but to accept the next most
reasonable rate before it. This bit of tribunal psychoanalysis would be
interesting but for one fact which Claimants overlooked in the decision.
Respondents in Mobil did indeed present three alternative rates to the ICC
tribunal for illustration purposes: 16%, 18% and 19.8%. Thus, contrary to
Claimants’ misstatement, the rate adopted by the tribunal, 18%, was not the
lowest of the three presented by respondents. Tribunal psychoanalysis is a
difficult exercise even when based on actual facts; it crosses into the realm of
fantasy when based on imaginary facts. Moreover, as Claimants’ counsel is
well aware, arbitral tribunals do not always limit themselves to the rates
proposed by the parties. The 19% selected in the Himpurna case and the 21%
selected in Patuha were not proposed by either side in those cases. The ICC
tribunal in Mobil obviously selected 18% not because it was the lowest proposal
on the table, but rather because it considered that to be an appropriate rate.16°°

1040. Similarly, the Respondents argue that the Claimants err in asserting that the Mobil
ICSID tribunal did not undertake an independent analysis with respect to the
applicable discount rate in order to avoid inconsistent decisions. Indeed, albeit
acknowledging that “other arbitral tribunals [had] adopted discount rates in
[comparable circumstances] ranging from 18.5% to 21%”,'°°° after “examining
voluminous submission and expert reports and hearing the expert testimony on the
discount rate issue”,’®"° the Mobil ICSID tribunal concluded that “a 18% discount

appropriately reflec[ed] the existing risks in [that] case”.1°"'

1041. A contrario, the Respondents submit that the case law relied upon by the Claimants is

inapposite:

Claimants have cited a number of other decisions applying discount rates in the
10 to 12% range. [ None of the tribunals referred to by Claimants was
presented with the discount rate analysis in the two Mobil cases, in Tidewater
and in Saint-Gobain, and three of those cases did not even involve oil-
producing projects anywhere, much less in Venezuela. With respect to
Occidental v. Ecuador, the tribunal's decision indicates that there was no real
dispute over the discount rate, even though it is impossible to understand how a
discount rate for an oil project in Ecuador could be lower than that for an oil
project in Venezuela. [...]. With respect to Gold Reserve, which involved a gold
mining project in Venezuela, the tribunal adopted in part the approach of the

claimant's expert, whereas that same expert's approach was the one roundly
rejected in the Tidewater case. [...] It may also be noted that one of the
arbitrators in the Tidewater case, who adopted a discount rate of around 26%
after seeing and hearing the submissions of Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, was
also an arbitrator in Occidental. Suffice it to say that facts are important, and
that the precedents most directly relevant to this case both on the facts and on
the principles adopted are the Mobil cases, Tidewater and Saint-Gobain.'®'2

Analysis
Preliminary matters

In consideration of the above arguments and allegations, the Tribunal will make a first
observation: it agrees with the Claimants’ and their quantum expert’s assumption that
the indemnification amounts owing under the DA provisions are properly
characterized as: (i) “cash flows to equity holders”;'6" or (ii) a “stream of equity cash
flows to Claimants, which ought to be paid by the state-owned equity holder in each
Project”.1614

Indeed, the Willful Breach Claim and the DA Claim are considerably different in terms
of their nature and implications. Indeed, the former stems from general applicable law
and thus requires meeting all the elements of civil liability, while the latter consists of
the application of specific contractual provisions previously agreed upon by the
Parties. Therefore, contrary to what the Respondents’ quantum experts suggest, '®'5 it
cannot be that both scenarios must be discounted on the same basis. The Tribunal
therefore finds that the Claimants’ preference for the unlevered CoE approach used
to calculate their proposed discount applicable to their DA Claim (over the WACC
approach employed to the same effect vis-a-vis their Willful Breach Claim) is

warranted. 1616

The previous finding, however, does not dispose of the matter at hand in favor of
either Party. On the one hand, it is common ground that the purpose of a discount
rate is to estimate the net present value of future cash flows.'®'7 On the other hand,
regardless of the method used, both Parties essentially use the same inputs to arrive
at their respective discount rates, i.e., the computation of a risk-free rate, an industry

risk premium, and a country risk premium. Hence the Tribunal must still determine the
appropriateness of the Parties’ calculations.

1045. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants argue in favor of a discount rate
of 15.21% (comprised of a 2.11% risk-free rate, a 6.22% industry risk premium
multiplied by a 1.13 unlevered beta, and a 6.1% country risk premium).'°® The
Respondents in turn argue in favor of a discount rate of 27.7% (comprised of a 2.1%
risk-free rate, a 5.8% industry risk premium, a 17.8% country risk-premium, and a
2.0% DLOM)."6'9

1046. The overarching contentions in terms of the applicable discount rate are thus two-
fold. First, to the extent that the Claimants do not account for it, the Respondents’
2.0% DLOM. Second, the considerable difference between the Parties’ estimation of
the country risk premium.

b. The 2.0% discount for lack of marketability (DLOM)

1047. The Respondents do not directly address the 2.0% DLOM in their written
submissions. Rather, the issue is mainly dealt with through their quantum experts.
The same goes for the Claimants.

1048. The discussion between the Parties’ experts on this point is summarized in Mr.
Brailovsky’s and Mr. Flores’ second expert report:

The Second Abdala Report argues that DLOMs do not apply when the
compensation formulas are used because, in this case, the claim is based “on
the specific formulas in the Projects’ Association Agreements, and not on the
transactional value of the Projects.” On the contrary, we maintain that the
scenario which uses the compensation formulas represents the true
“transactional value” of the Projects, insofar as any hypothetical third party
buyer will take them fully into account when establishing a bid price. Dr. Abdala
also argues that [...] DLOMs do not apply due to the “Projects’ nature as crude
oil producers, as the stability of the Projects’ cash flows and their economic
fundamentals ensures minimal exit costs for a willing seller.” Note that Dr.
Abdala uses the word “minimal” which is not the same as “zero.” To the extent
that he is accepting that there are exit costs, he should have tried to estimate
them in order to arrive at a truly fair market value for the Projects, but he simply
decided not to do so. The discussion should have been whether our
measurement of DLOM is accurate, not about whether it is applicable.

Dr. Abdala accepts that DLOMs are used in “distress” cases, and that the
Projects are not distressed. He may be right that the Projects are not

1618 C-PHB, § 875. The Tribunal in any event notes that the Claimants just broadly acknowledge that Mr. Abdala
calculated the discount rate applicable to their DA Claim pursuant to an unlevered CoE method. The Claimants’
written submissions are by-and-large dedicated to argue of the 13.8% calculated pursuant to the WACC
approach.

1619 Supra, fn. 1575.

398

distressed, but it is wrong to say that DLOMs only apply in such cases. They
apply whenever there is a lack of marketability, which is a condition external to
the assets to be valued. Thus, a distressed company whose stock trades on the
New York Exchange may easily sell, albeit at a very low price. In contrast, a
perfectly healthy company may have difficulties in finding a buyer if it is located
in an oligopolistic market where there are few buyers or when government
authorizations are required. And in fact, given the complex nature of the
Projects, not many companies exist in the world able and willing to participate in
them. Moreover, recall that the Projects were authorized at the highest level by
special authorizations, and therefore selling them would inevitably attract much
government scrutiny. 162°

1049. The Tribunal cannot agree with the position taken by the Respondents’ quantum

experts. Whether or not the DA formulae represent the true transactional value of the

Projects, the Tribunal finds that a DLOM is not justified on the mere basis that the

Projects might face “minimal” exit costs. This is particularly so given that:

The notion of “marketability” relied upon by Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores is
precisely defined as “the ability to quickly convert property to cash at minimal
cost”.'®2! This suggests that exit costs, especially if they are minimal, may not
necessarily warrant adjustment through a DLOM.

Mr. Brailovsky’s and Mr. Flores’ 2% DLOM is not based on data reflecting the
particular factual circumstances of the Projects. At most, their volatility
coefficient (one of the assumptions necessary for calculating DLOMs) is
defined in terms of, inter alia, the Venezuelan stock market;1®? a reference
that is unlikely to serve as an adequate proxy for privately traded oil extraction
undertakings in the Venezuelan Orinoco Belt. The remaining assumptions and
fundamentals of the proposed DLOM are of a theoretical nature and appear to
share no straightforward connection with the Projects.1®° As such, the
Tribunal finds them exceedingly speculative and generic. In these
circumstances, being the Party alleging the need to apply a DLOM, the
Respondents bear the burden of proof: a DLOM rate cannot be granted simply
because the Claimants’ quantum expert did not provide an alternative rate.

1621 Brailovsky & Flores ER |, RER-3, § 347 (emphasis added); Brailovsky/Flores ICSID Consolidated Report,
App. BF-406, § 500.

1622 Brailovsky & Flores ER |, RER-3, § 353; Brailovsky/Flores ICSID Consolidated Report, App. BF-406, § 509.
The Tribunal acknowledges that, according to Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores, basing their volatility coefficient
partly on publicly traded stocks would tend to underestimate the true volatility of the Projects. Such an
assumption, however, lacks support: neither the Respondents nor their quantum experts have provided evidence
accounting for a relation between privately traded companies and increased price volatility.

498-509.

1050.

1051.

1052.

1053.

The Tribunal further finds Mr. Brailovsky’s and Mr. Flores’ assertion that DLOMs
apply both to distressed and perfectly healthy companies (the latter when placed in
an oligopolistic market with few potential buyers or when government authorizations
are required) to be unsubstantiated. As noted by Mr. Abdala, the Respondents’
quantum experts “cite studies by O’Hara and Abbott to support the inclusion of a
DLOM in the discount rate. The aspect of illiquidity that is discussed in these studies,
however, mostly relates to assets in distress, and transaction costs. This is inapposite
to the valuation of the Projects, because the Projects were not in distress and
Claimants were not under compulsion to divest”.'®*4 Differently stated, the application
of DLOMs to non-distressed companies is unsubstantiated. Indeed, the Respondents
and their quantum experts overall fail to: (i) account for the already particularly
qualified and sophisticated nature of the Projects’ potential buyers; and/or (ii) specify
and prove how and to what extent governmental authorizations could hinder the
marketability of the Projects.

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal is of the view that the DLOM is not
justified in this case. The Respondents’ proposed discount rate can thus only amount
to 25.7% at most.

The country risk premium and the overall applicable discount rate

Having dismissed the Respondents’ 2.0% DLOM, the Parties’ calculations of the base
line risk-free rate are on par with a 2.1%, and differ by 0.4% (without the unlevered
beta) and by 11.7% in relation to the industry risk premium and the country risk
premium, respectively.1°?5 However, despite the foregoing disparity in terms of both
industry risk and country risk premiums, the Parties do not address the former
separately from the latter. Indeed, the Parties’ submission mostly deal either with: (i)
the country risk premium in particular; and/or (ii) their respective proposed discount
rates as a whole. The Tribunal shall follow the same approach.

In this regard, the Tribunal finds merit in several of the Claimants’ arguments. First,
the Tribunal agrees with the importance of making a distinction between the notions
of IRR and minimal IRR (or hurdle rate), on the one hand, and discount rate, on the
other.

1824 Abdala ER Il, CER-8, § 114.
1825 Supra, §§ 1051, 1044.

1056.

As already noted above, it is not controversial that the discount rate seeks to
determine the net present value of future cash flows.'®6 It does so by, chiefly,
factoring-in the industry and country risks that impact the cash flows; this is not
controversial either. In turn, the IRR appears to serve as a profitability index: a rate
that may well be commensurate with a specific project's past profitability or, in the
case of new or greenfield projects, the projected return on a plausible investment.
Correspondingly, a minimal IRR or hurdle rate constitutes the minimal expected
profitability yield warranted to justify an investment. In this sense, it does seem to be
the case that only the discount rate directly measures risk.'®”

The evidence on record confirms the Tribunal’s understanding. The divide between
an expected IRR and an estimated discount is evident in the agreement concluded
between Venezuela and China in relation to the Junin 4 Block project.'®° This
agreement (ratified by Venezuela in May 2010) provides for the creation of a mixed
company involving CNPC and CVP for the implementation of the Junin 4 Block oil
project in the Orinoco Belt.1®9 It states: (i) “the activities” of the mixed company “will
be aimed at obtaining an Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) [...] equal or above
eighteen percent (18%), without constituting a contractual obligation for [Venezuela]
that this profit will be obtained [...]; and (ii) “[b]ased on this level of profitability, [...]
the "Recovery Time" for the "Investments" [...] is understood to be the number of
years necessary for the Mixed Company to recover the Investment [...] based on net
cash flow, discounted at an annual discount rate of ten per cent (10%)”.16°

The Tribunal notes that Mr. Figuera, “former General Manager of PDVSA’s Junin
Division”,‘°" refers to the foregoing figures as “guidelines”, “premises”, and
“assumptions” for the purposes of establishing an “economic evaluation prior to [the
parties] taking [a] final investment decision”.'®°* In particular, Mr. Figuera referred to
the 18% IRR as a “corporate target” (as opposed to a “commitment” or an

Time, namely, as an] economic evaluation to make the final investment decision” (as
opposed to an analysis of “the economy of the business”)."®4 Be that as it may, the
IRR and discount rate were clearly given different functions (and even value) at the
moment of considering the initial investment: the IRR was associated with expected
profitability, while the discount rate with the net present value of cash flows necessary
to recoup the said investment.

1057. Most of the evidence relied upon by the Respondents points in the same direction.
Indeed, while the Respondents assert that “all the literature on” IRR, hurdle rates and
discount rates establish a “connection” between these concepts, '®5 only one doctrinal
account appears to employ these terms interchangeably.'®° Yet, it does so for the
purposes of that particular “text” and/or in the context of how these rates are used in
“common practice”;'®°” something that does not belie the technical differences
between them.

1058. The remaining authorities relied upon by the Respondents simply define the notion of
“hurdle rate” as:168

i. The minimum rate of return on a project or investment required by a manager
or investor. In order to compensate for risk, the riskier the project, the higher the
hurdle rate;1°°9

is planning its outlays in the medium and long-term, it requires a certain rate of

return on projects, because they can be quite expensive and the outlays tie up

capital that can be used elsewhere. This required return is called the hurdle

rate. 1642
Nothing of the above, however, equates an estimated IRR or a necessary hurdle rate
with the discount rate appropriate to bring future cash flows back to the net present
value. To be clear, the Tribunal is not of the view that the concepts of IRR and hurdle
rate are to be disassociated from the notion of investment risk. Indeed, the Tribunal
accepts that, the riskier the project, the higher an IRR or hurdle rate is likely to be
required. Otherwise, the project in question could face “a low return that [might] dilute
[the] return on capital employed”.'*3 That, however, is different from stating that a
firms’ (minimal) IRR is a tool for directly or independently measuring the risk
pertaining to the cost of capital. Differently stated, while it might well be that an IRR
interplays with the appropriate discount rate, arriving at an IRR does not necessarily
determine the applicable discount rate.

The position of the Parties’ quantum experts is vastly different on this point. Mr.
Brailovsky and Mr. Flores illustrate their view with the following example:

For illustrative purposes, assume that an asset has a lifetime of one year. At the
end of that year it is expected to yield a net cash flow of US$ 125. Assume that
the asset is purchased for a price of US$ 100 to be paid at the beginning of the
year. This is tantamount to saying that the buyer considers that a profit rate of
25% satisfies its expectations, as the transaction is anticipated to provide US$
25 after covering the initial investment of US$ 100. Alternatively, one can say
that the buyer has applied a discount rate of 25%. In multi-year projects the
same simple concept applies, although the computation is slightly more
complicated. This example underlines the fundamental point that, in a situation
where no debt exists, a discount rate is no more and no less than an expected
rate of profit.1644

The Respondents complement their experts’ opinion by affirming that “[aJnyone using
a discount rate lower than the hurdle rate in determining whether to enter into a
project would be grossly overpaying for that project, a business approach that no

rational company would adopt”.1645

1062. Mr. Abdala in turn offers the following hypothetical:

Assume that the target asset exhibited high profitability (i.e., returns of 25% per
year) that is expected to be maintained in the future. Assume, in addition, that
investors can source capital, at an average cost of 10%. According to Brailovsky
and Flores’s long-term profitability proposition, a buyer should use the 25% as
discount rate to value this asset (thus yielding a much lower price than if the
buyer's actual cost of capital, 10%, had been used as a discount rate). In this
environment, however, the seller will never voluntarily transfer the asset at the
(low) price implied by a 25% discount rate, as otherwise it would be giving away
significantly more value than it would receive. Further, because the seller knows
that alternative buyers could source funds at an average of 10% cost of capital,
this implies that, in a competitive environment, the seller would just wait for
other buyers that would be willing to earn a normal return on equity at 10% (or
marginally higher). Although the buyer would like to pay a low price (consistent
with a discount rate above the 10% cost of capital), competition among buyers
will drive the price upwards, such that buyers will obtain just a normal expected
return on the investment and no more. That is, the transaction price in a
competitive market will reflect an implicit discount rate equal to the cost of
capital, and not the historic profitability rate.1°46

1063. The evidence relied upon by the Respondents again seems to run contrary to their
position. In her intervention at the 2006 public hearing before the Alaska State
Legislature, Ms. Kah indeed referred to a 12% rate that, in her view, could be higher
in projects located elsewhere than in the United States. However, contrary to the
Respondents’ submission,'*4”7 Ms. Kah's reference pertained to the applicable
“discount rate”.1°48 While Ms. Kah also dealt with the notion of IRR, she did so

separately. In particular, Ms. Kah stated:

First | wanted to say that companies really do look at a range of measures; we
don't look at one measure. And IRR is a very important measure that we
take very seriously. We also take some measures seriously that economists,
including myself, really gasp at: return on capital employed. A very important
measure to us as an accounting measure and economists hate it, but Wall
Street pays attention to it, it actually access price-earnings ratio, in terms of
stock prices. So it's very important that we look at return on capital employ and
make sure we don't invest in a project that will have such a low return that it will
dilute our return on capital employed. We also, of course, do look at net
present value. But | would like to comment that if it is true that this project [...],
the Alaska pipeline, has the highest net present value of any project in the world
that that's because it requires the most investment and it's the largest project.
That doesn't mean the returns are going to be commensurate with that. [...]
Some of the comments that Econ One made about the way we look at projects
and even discount rates that we use, | would disagree with. Our industry
doesn't necessarily use the 10 percent discount rate. And | think you even
presented some material yesterday indicating that a U.S. risk discount rate
was more like 12 percent, and that's for the U.S. in general. If you looked at the
energy industry it would probably be higher than that in terms of the risk
involved in energy projects in the United States. [...] and this may sound like a
small detail to people, but [...] you even said in your analysis yesterday that 1

percentage point in a discount rate is worth $5 billion in MPV [market present
value].'649
1064. In line with Mr. Abdala’s hypothetical,'°° Ms. Kah’s intervention: (i) does not treat the
notions of IRR and discount rate interchangeably; (ii) associates the notion of
discount with the notion of net present value; (iii) sets apart the high net present value
of a project from the IRR yield; and (iv) recognizes the important effect of the
applicable discount rate on the market present value of a project.

1065. The Respondents similarly rely on Dr. Finizza’s (i.e. Econ One) presentation made for
the purposes of the same public hearing before the Alaska State Legislature (and to
which Ms. Kah reacted).'°5' However, Dr. Finizza’s intervention is again unfavorable

to the Respondents’ position on this issue.

1066. As recounted by the Respondents, Dr. Finizza’s presentation commenced by
explaining that “[p]rojects need to be evaluated at the risk-adjusted cost of capital,
which may be above the Weighted Average Cost of Capital,” and that a project is
made riskier by “Uncertainty,” “Political risk” and “Economic risk””.1852 He made these
observations when dealing with the notion of discount rate.'? Notably, Dr. Finizza
identified several discount rates, namely, a 10% “Gasline discount rate”, as well as
discount rates applicable as of 2005 to the United States (12%), Norway (13%), Qatar
(21%), and Venezuela (25%).1654

1067. Dr. Finizza’s presentation, however, did not stop there. He went on to separately
define IRR as the “rate at which the NPV of a project equals zero” (the same
mathematical definition used by the Claimants),'°° and to distinguish it from the

the Respondents’ assertion, Ms. Kah did not opine that a “return of higher than 12% presumably at least 15%,
would be necessary for an energy project in the United States” (R-PHB, § 848). Rather, it seems that, reacting to
Dr. Finizza’s presentation, Ms. Kah disagreed with his 10% “Gasline discount rate” yet to some extent concurred
with his 12% discount rate applicable to energy projects in the United States.

“threshold rate of return” (or hurdle rate), which he then estimated to be between
12%-15% for projects without “significant risk factors”.1°°° Dr. Finizza’s differentiation
between these concepts went as far as stating that “[a]ll projects with an IRR greater
than the risk-adjusted cost of capital [i.e. discount rate] should be accepted when
there are no capital budget restraints [and] [c]hoose [even] higher IRR projects when
there are capital budget restraints”.'°°” Dr. Finizza’s “business approach”, which in
fact reflects the Venezuela-China agreement for the development of the Junin 4
Block,'®* is unfathomably characterized by the Respondents as the one that “no
rational company would adopt”.'®°

1068. Dr. Finizza remained consistent during questioning before the Legislative Budget and
Audit Committee. As noted by the Respondents, the exchange between Senator
Wilken and Dr. Finizza went as follows:

SENATOR WILKEN referred to the language on page 16, which shows that the
[Ibbotson Associates] work indicated the following international costs of capital,
based on market data and country credit ratings: U.S. - 12 percent; Norway - 13
percent; Qatar - 21 percent; and Venezuela - 25 percent. He said there has
been discussion about an 8-10 percent discount rate. He asked, "And so, if we
were going to build this project in ... Venezuela, instead of using a 10 [percent
discount rate], we'd be using a 25 [percent rate]?"

DR. FINIZZA answered yes. He continued:

Let's say you had an IRR from a project in ... Norway, and it had an IRR of 15,
and you had an IRR in Venezuela of, say, 20. You would probably say, "I'm
more happy with the Norwegian one, because of ... [the] risk premium, ... and |
would reject, perhaps, the Venezuela one, even though it had a higher IRR at
the same discount rate, but it didn't pass the hurdle of 25.6

1069. The Tribunal disagrees with the Respondents’ reading of Dr. Finizza’s answer. It is
not that “an investor would require a premium above the rate of return required in less
risky countries to invest in Venezuela”.'°*' Rather it is more likely that Dr. Finizza
precisely reaffirmed the business approach that the Respondents deem inapposite:
the reason why the Norwegian project would be a better option in that particular

scenario is because, despite its lower IRR (15%), it would still be higher than its 13%
discount rate. Conversely, despite the Venezuelan projects’ higher IRR (20%), it
would be lower than its 25% discount rate. Regardless, Dr. Finizza’s approach further
confirms that the notions of IRR, hurdle rate and discount rate are not synonymous.

1070. In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the statements made by Mr. McKee, Mr.
Sheets, Mr. Fox, and Mr. Moyes, on which the Respondents rely to support their
proposed discount rate, are besides the point.'*©? They all refer to IRRs or hurdle
rates ranging from 20% to 30%, not to discount rates. 16

1071. Similarly, whether or not the /CC Mobil tribunal “misunderstood” the distinction
between discount rate and IRR is immaterial.'®°4 For the Tribunal, it suffices to note
that the /CC Mobil tribunal did base its 18% discount rate determination, at least
partly, on the “volatility in rates of return”, on “long-term historical rates of return”, and
on “average [rates of] return” of both ExxonMobil (the claimant's parent company)
and other “comparable oil companies”.®° In view of this, the Tribunal agrees with the
Claimants’ quantum expert that paying regard to measurements of past or actual
profitability to calculate a discount rate:

i. Induces certain level of survivorship bias (i.e. only measuring the success of the
“largest crude oil companies” as opposed to those that failed)."°° This is
particularly so if the profitability of a parent company is factored-in. The rate of
return of a parent company “has no necessary connection to what a willing
buyer would pay for a specific asset owned by that company”."°°”

ii. “[MJay have nothing to do with what willing buyers and willing sellers may be
willing to pay for an asset if they discount” cash flows either at the cost of
capital or the cost of equity.®®8

1072. The findings of the /CC Mobil award therefore do not serve as useful guidance for the
Tribunal in reaching its determination of the appropriate discount rate in the case at
hand.'®°° The same can be said of the /CSID Mobil award which, although the tribunal

1669 Accordingly, the Tribunal needs not determine whether the /CC Mobil tribunal had no alternative other than
opting for an 18% discount rate in light of the alleged unreasonableness of the one proposed by the claimant in
that case (C-PHB, § 942(b); R-PHB, § 828).

407

certainly undertook an independent analysis of the case before it (contrary to what
the Claimants appear to imply),"8”° nonetheless endorsed the discount rate
methodology adopted in the CC Mobil award to some extent.'67"

1073. The Tribunal finds further merit in the Claimants’ arguments with respect to the
inadequacy of Venezuela's sovereign debt in the calculation of the discount rate.1972
According to the Respondents’ quantum experts, the yields of the private sector
bonds denominated in foreign currencies are not impervious to the behavior of the
sovereign bond of their jurisdiction. Therefore, downward trends in the latter affect the
former; a factor that must be accounted for when determining the country risk
premium in the discount rate.'°’? Mr. Brailovsky's and Mr. Flores’ main example to
that effect concerned the corporate bond rating of Repsol-YPF (“YPF”) operating in
Argentina around its sovereign default in the early 2000s.'°% The figures provided by
the Respondents’ quantum experts indeed show that YPF’s corporate bond rating
dropped various credit notches during that time.'®”5 However, as pointed out by the
Claimants and their expert, and rightly so, Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores failed to
compare YPF’s bond yields to those of Argentina during the same period. Had they
done so, says Mr. Abdala, they would have noted that the bonds moved
independently.1°”6

1074. Notably, when confronted with this data during the Hearing, Mr. Brailovksy was
unable to account for the autonomous behaviour of the bond yields besides noting
some occasional parallel evolution."®”” Yet, the Tribunal finds that concurrence is far

from correlation and even more so from causation. Accordingly, the Tribunal

considers that the status of Venezuela’s sovereign debt has no place in the
calculation of the discount rate to be applied here. 1°78

1075. Moreover, the Claimants submit that the Projects would not have been fully exposed
to Venezuelan country risk.'®”° The Tribunal partially agrees. As suggested elsewhere
in this Award, while the Claimants produced and traded a commodity whose
revenues were primarily obtained in USD, it is not accurate to state that such
revenues could have remained in USD.'®° Further, while it might be true that the
Projects acquired critical items from international markets (in terms “of transport
pipelines to the port, the upgraders and fuel for the upgraders, and the port to
transport the [CCO] to market”),'®*! they did use local capital (in terms of workforce at
least) and were thus not immune to supply chain disruptions.'°°* In addition, the
Projects’ production facilities (i.e., oil fields and upgraders) are unmovable. Hence, it
is spurious to accept that all country-specific factors affecting production schedules
and profits would have been avoided.

1076. Nevertheless, the Claimants are fully correct in that the Projects counted “with legal
protections designed to reduce their exposure to adverse governmental actions”,'®°°
such as the DA provisions themselves and investment treaty arbitration. The
Respondents disagree:

[T]he argument that the Projects were protected from regulatory risk by treaty
[...] and that regulatory risk should therefore be excluded from the calculation of
the country risk premium evinces a fundamental misunderstanding of the
concept of country risk. That argument would effectively eliminate the concept
of political risk as an integral part of country risk, thereby distorting the discount
rate analysis. Moreover, the factual premise of Claimants’ argument is incorrect.
Absent a stabilization agreement, a treaty does not protect an investor from
most regulatory risks and does not prevent expropriation. Treaties do provide
for the calculation of compensation based on fair market value before an
expropriatory measure is implemented or announced, but they do not direct that
the calculation of compensation should be based on a pretend universe where
the generalized regulatory risk in the host State never existed.16°4

1678 The Tribunal therefore needs not make a determination on the Claimants’ argument that the Respondents’
quantum experts inadequately “anchor their country risk premium on the [...] present-day borrowing costs of the
Venezuelan government”. (supra, § 1021.i).

1077. The Respondents’ position is misguided. An investment treaty does not prevent an
expropriation or, in fact, any other public measure possibly impacting a particular
undertaking. Yet, that is beside the point. An investment treaty does accord some
foreign investors additional protection against state measures that other investors
(even within the same affected industry) might not otherwise have. The ICSID
Arbitration initiated by the Claimants attests to that fact. The point is not that an
applicable treaty would have eliminated regulatory or country risk, but rather that it
would have managed or mitigated it.

1078. The same goes for the DA provisions, as clearly conceded by Mr. Brailovksy at the
Hearing:

Q. Okay. And then, finally, you suggest that the DA Provisions were the
instruments that ConocoPhillips used to “‘manage’ political and expropriation
risks”; yes?

A. (Mr. Brailovsky) Yes.

Q. So, what you're saying in these last two sentences is that ConocoPhillips
managed its exposure to country risk through the DA Clauses; yes?

A. (Mr. Brailovsky) Yes.

Q. So, you're saying that contractual protections can be used to manage
exposure to country risk?

A. (Mr. Brailovsky) well, that’s what they thought, yes.

Q. But do you believe it?

A. (Mr. Brailovksky) Well, they didn’t get full fiscal stabilization.

Q. That wasn’t my question. My question was: You're saying that contractual
protections can be used to manage— didn’t say, “eliminate”, to “manage’—
country risk; yes?

A. (Mr. Brailovsky) Yes, correct.

Q. And this is why a discount rate calculation needs to take into account the
individual characteristics of the company or Project; yes?

 

A. (Mr. Brailovsky) Yes.1®®>

1079. In this regard, the Tribunal doubts that the discount rates referred to by Ms. Kah, "68

any of the foregoing risk-mitigating circumstances. Indeed, these discount rates, all of
which the Respondents rely upon, appear to either accommodate “generic” country-
tisk assessments,'® or involve assets located outside Venezuela.'®*' As such, they
are of little assistance for evaluating the specific risk exposure of the Projects and
even less to determine the discount rate applicable to the stream of cash flows
germane to the compensation owed under the DA provisions of each AA.1992

1080. For similar reasons, the Tribunal finds only limited guidance in the discount rates
relied upon by the Claimants. The Claimants refer to: (i) a report prepared for the
Petrozuata Project and a Financing Memorandum for the Hamaca Project, both dated
2000, and estimating a discount rate of 8.53% and 10%, respectively;'©% and (ii) a
presentation bearing the logos of PDVSA, the Government, and the Ministry,
projecting a discount rate between 8% to 12% “to value these very Projects” in 2008
(i.e. soon after the Expropriation).'°°* While these discount rates were identified by
the Projects’ participants themselves (and thus presumably denote the specifics of
the Projects), they were set considerably prior to the relevant valuation date of the

present case.

1081. As already established,°° in accordance with the Parties’ agreement the
compensation owed under the DA provisions must be determined pursuant to an ex
post date-of-award valuation. Notably, the Claimants themselves have stated that the
application of a discount rate responds to the need of “bring[ing] cash flows back to
present value as of the date of the Award”.'©° |t follows that the discount rate and its
components must reflect the circumstances at the date of valuation.1®°” Further, the
Tribunal agrees with the Respondents that the “discount rate varies depending upon

 

1689 Supra, fn. 1605.
1699 Gold Reserve, CLA-21, § 840.

1631 |n relation to the Merey Sweeney report, the Tribunal in any event agrees with the Claimants that the refinery
dealt with therein had specific characteristics that made it particularly unmarketable and thus notably risky: “[t]he
Merey Sweeny case [...] concerned the termination of a 50% interest in a joint venture agreement relating to the
construction and operation of refinery components in Texas [which] were captured within a large refinery complex
that the joint venture did not own” (C-PHB, § 931.932). The Tribunal therefore needs not make a determination on
the Claimants’ procedural objection to the introduction of the Merey Sweeney report in this arbitration.

1692 The same applies to arbitral case law setting discount rates with respects to assets located elsewhere than in
Venezuela. Accordingly, the Tribunal shall not follow the determination in Himpurna, Lemire, Occidental
Petroleum, and Enron.

conditions prevailing as of the valuation date”.®° In short, the country risk faced by
the Projects in 2000 or in 2008 is not the same as the country risk they would face
today: the now applicable discount rate must therefore take that difference into
account. The same can be said of the 10% discount rate estimated for the Junin 4
Block project back in 2010.1°°9

1082. That being said, as pointed out by the Claimants,’°° the Tribunal notes that the
Respondents have not countered the 8% to 10% discount rates that the Claimants
submit have been used in: (i) the 2008-2014 Consolidated Financial Statements for
PDVSA and its subsidiaries;'7' and (ii) the 2014 Cardon project between PDVSA and
ENI/Repsol.'7°? Being closer to the relevant valuation date, the Tribunal cannot but
take them into consideration.

1083. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tribunal agrees with the rationale behind
Tidewater and Saint Gobain as argued by the Respondents, which essentially runs as
follows: a proper but-for scenario must reflect the country risk exposure in full, that is,
even the possibility of Venezuela adopting measures affecting the Projects including
but not limited to expropriatory measures.'7°° Indeed, contrary to the Claimants’
arguments, the issue here is not “rewarding [Venezuela's] violations of international
law [or] creat[ing] an incentive for [it] to take property in violation of its international
obligations”.'7°4 Rather, it is to properly assess the political risk of doing business in a
particular state; a query that is economic and not legal.'”°5 Hence, whether or not the
underlying public measure is deemed lawful or not, is irrelevant." This is particularly
so in the case at hand, where the Respondents’ obligation to provide limited
indemnity to the Claimants under the DA provisions corresponds to a contractual
characterization of a determined qualified measure as a DA: it does not necessarily

1084. In light of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal considers that the country risk
premium (or better, the equity impact of country risk), can be appropriately set at
8.89%. Following the Claimants’ unlevered CoE approach,'’°” the Tribunal therefore
determines that the applicable discount rate is 18%. Overall, in the circumstances,
the Tribunal considers that an 18% discount rate is reasonable.

H. OTHERS
1. Fiscal maximization

1085. The Parties’ experts have quantified the damages recoverable by the Claimants
under two scenarios which correspond to the two claims asserted in the arbitration,
namely, for the Willful Breach Claims and for the DA Claims.'7°® However, the experts
disagree on the assumptions regarding the applicable fiscal regime to be taken into

account when quantifying the damages under each scenario.17°9
1086. In a nutshell, the Respondents’ experts assume that:

For royalties and taxes for the period June 26, 2007 through the end of the
original terms of the Association Agreements, [...] the Government of
Venezuela [...] would have exercised its sovereign powers to enact such
measures as would enable it to capture the maximum amount of revenue, after
deduction of any compensation that would be payable by the State companies
participating in the Projects under the compensation provisions of the
Association Agreements.17'°

1087. Elaborating on the above assertion, it is the Respondents’ case that the Projects did
not enjoy any fiscal stability and were subject to a very precise compensation
mechanism. This mechanism limited the Claimants’ compensation entitlement to the

1709 The Tribunal notes that the disagreement arises out of the difference in instructions given to each expert by its
Party.

170 Brailovsky & Flores ER |, RER-3, §§ 6, 30; Tr. (Day 9), 2483:12 — 2484:15 (Louis T. Wells: Claimants and
their Expert also assume in their calculations a frozen fiscal regime; that is, that nothing changes after the
nationalization. | think this is unrealistic. [...] To assume that there — If one assumes there was no nationalization,
which one has to do in a but-for analysis, then one must expect that the Government would have taken other
steps to increase Government take in face of the continuing escalation of oil prices, the dependence of the
country on oil revenue in its budget, its need for funds as social projects expanded and the changed political
environment. So, in conclusion, | think it's unreasonable to assume that, having retained the right to take
Government measures affecting the Projects, Venezuela would not have continued to exercise its sovereign
powers to increase Government take in high-price scenarios; that is, after the nationalization, if the nationalization
had not occurred--and at least up to a level that would not be offset by obligations incurred by the State
enterprise”).

“equitable compensation” payable under the DA provisions and nothing further.”
Thus, but-for the Expropriation, it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the
Government would not have stood by and allowed the associations to capture the
benefits of high oil prices. Rather, as “[t]he owner of the resource” it would have
exercised its sovereign powers “to obtain the benefit of [these] exceptional profits.”1712
By way of example, the Respondents contend that if the Expropriation had not taken
place, the Government would have imposed a royalty on the Projects such that they
“would be left with a profit margin of approximately US$ 1 per barrel.”17"5 The
Respondents submit that this conclusion makes undeniable “economic, business and
common sense” and the Claimants’ attempt to argue that there is no automatic “value
cap” or “compensation cap” in the AAs is baseless and futile.17'4

According to the Claimants’ expert, the Respondents’ above assumption of “fiscal
maximization” by the Government is inconsistent with the actual taxation policy
implemented by Venezuela after the Expropriation and is in any event “commercially

unreasonable”.1715

First, the Claimants submit that post-Expropriation, Venezuela has not imposed any
taxes on the revenues from either of the Projects “such that the projects would be left
with a profit margin of approximately US$ 1 per barrel.”"7'® Consequently, the
Respondents’ argument that the Government would tax away all revenues above the
DA compensation deals in mere hypotheticals and is thus untenable.17"”

Second, the Claimants submit that the Respondents’ fiscal maximization assumption
erroneously attempts to impose a “value cap” or “compensation cap” on the
profits/compensation from the Projects which is not borne out by either the terms of
the AAs or their negotiating history.'’1 In this regard, the Claimants submit that there
is no provision in the AAs that states that the Claimants shall forego all revenues
generated above the DA compensation level in the event of breaches by the

Respondents. Quite to the contrary, the Claimants submit that the DA provisions are
a “special additional mechanism for compensation against adverse government
conduct’, i.e. the actions of a third party, and they cannot be distorted to otherwise
limit the flow of compensation to the Claimants for the Respondents’ breaches of their
own contractual obligations.1719

1091. In light of the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal finds that the fiscal maximization
assumption is relevant to the quantification of damages arising out of the Willful
Breach Claims only. Indeed, this is common ground between the Parties.17° The
Tribunal has previously concluded that the Respondents are not liable for willfully
breaching the AAs.1721

1092. The Tribunal further notes that the fiscal maximization assumption plays no role in the
quantification of compensation under the DA Claims: the Claimants do not dispute
that there is a cap on the compensation recoverable from the Respondents for DAs
pursuant to the DA provisions in the AAs.1722

1093. In the circumstances, as the fiscal maximization assumption does not play a role in
the assessment of compensation payable to the Claimants for their DA Claims, the
Tribunal does not need to determine the correctness of this assumption. However,
the Tribunal implements this decision in the AUVM by toggling the appropriate toggle
in favor of the Claimants.'7*? Otherwise, the Tribunal would give effect to an argument
by the Respondents that, by definition, ought not to have any effect in the DA

scenario.

Hamaca Project debt

In calculating the compensation payable under the DA provisions for the Hamaca
Project, Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores deduct the amount of debt payable by the
Hamaca Project to its lenders from the Project's annual cash flows.'774 Mr. Abdala, on
the other hand, does not deduct the outstanding debt while calculating compensation
for the DA Claims.725

According to Mr. Abdala, while ordinarily a quantum analysis based on a market
value approach would take into account financial debt repayments by subtracting
them from the company’s cash flows, this need not be done here when calculating
compensation for DAs under the Hamaca AA. This is so because the DA
compensation formula in the Hamaca AA does not contemplate the deduction of
outstanding debt, thus reflecting the Parties’ specific understanding of the DA
compensation mechanism.1726

Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores disagree. In their view, nothing in the DA formula of the
Hamaca AA prevents the netting out of financial debt, especially as this is the
standard approach to determining compensation. They submit that the absence of a
debt repayment component in the DA formula of the Hamaca AA does not negate the
need to deduct outstanding debt in order to arrive at the appropriate compensation
calculation. They explain that in the ordinary course of business, the Claimants would
have received DA compensation but would have to simultaneously pay their share of
the Project debt. To argue otherwise creates a windfall for the Claimants which
cannot be permitted.'”2” Accordingly, they submit that the debt must be deducted
from the Hamaca Project's cash flows.1778

As an initial observation, the Tribunal notes that the above point in dispute between
the Parties’ quantum experts only pertains to the compensation payable under the
Hamaca AA. It is common ground between the Parties’ experts that insofar as the
Petrozuata AA is concerned, compensation is arrived at using a “standard economic

amount of debt outstanding as of 30 June 2015 from the net present value (“NPV”) of the annual cash flows
projected after that date. Brailovsky & Flores ER |, RER-3, § 222.

approach” which computes the Project’s revenues, costs, taxes, change in working
capital, and debt repayments. 1729

Turning to the Hamaca AA, the Tribunal is persuaded by the position adopted by Mr.
Abdala. It is clear that an ordinary market valuation of the compensation due to the
Claimants for a harmful act could have required the deduction of outstanding debt
from the Hamaca Project’s revenues. However, the situation is not the same in this
instance: the calculation of compensation is not based on the standard market
approach. It is governed by a specific formula which has been agreed upon by the
Parties as reflective of the compensation/indemnity that shall be payable by the
Respondents to the Claimants in case of a DA.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the outstanding debt of the Hamaca
Project need not be deducted from the Project’s cash flows in order to arrive at the
compensation payable to the Claimants under the Hamaca AA. The Respondents’
quantum experts may be correct that, in the ordinary course of business, the
Claimants would have been required to pay their share of the Hamaca Project debt.
That does not mean, however, that the Respondents’ obligation to compensate the
Claimants under the DA provision was contingent on the payment of the said Project
debt by the Claimants.

The DA provisions at issue have a specific purpose: providing limited indemnity to the
Claimants in the event a discriminatory and unjust qualified measure causes MAE to
the Hamaca Project. As such, the application of the Hamaca DA provisions certainly
finds itself outside the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, the Respondents’
reliance on general compensation principles, without any specific reference to how
debt repayment (between Project participants) may fall under either the RNCF or the
TCF formulae, is insufficient.

For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal does not make a determination as to whether the
repayment of the Hamaca Project debt remains an outstanding obligation on behalf of
the Claimants. It might be that the Respondents could still be entitled to recover said
amount as far as general civil liability is concerned. Nevertheless, the Tribunal
considers that the specific DA compensation provisions are inapposite to that effect.
As such, the Tribunal is of the view that discounting the Hamaca Project debt from
the indemnity owed to the Claimants pursuant to the Hamaca DA provisions is

unwarranted.

Science and Technology Contribution

It is common ground between the Parties’ quantum experts that Article 35 of the Ley
Organica de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacién of 2005,'7°° and Article 26 of the Ley
de Reforma de la Ley Organica de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacién of 2010
(together, “Science and Technology Contribution” or “STC”),'75' require oil and gas
companies to contribute a certain percentage of their yearly gross revenues to the
advancement of science, technology, and innovation in Venezuela: 2% from 2005
through 2010 and 1% from 2011 onwards (i.e. until the expiration of the Projects).172

The Parties’ experts, however, disagree on the implementation of the STC. According
to Mr. Abdala, the STC would apply to the Projects’ current year gross revenues
obtained from the sale of hydrocarbons only.17°3 Mr. Brailovksly and Mr. Flores in turn
submit that the STC applies to the Project's previous year total gross revenues.'7*4

As to whether the STC is applicable to the previous or the current year’s gross
revenues, the statutory provisions of this measure alone are enough to dispose of the
issue. While from 2005 to 2010 the temporal scope of the STC was not entirely
clear,'755 it has been quite straightforward thereafter. Indeed, since 2011 the STC
requires the payment of an “annua{l]” contribution of 1% of the “gross income
obtained in the immediately preceding fiscal year”.'°° The Tribunal finds no reason,
and the Claimants have provided none, to conclude that such an inter-temporal

principle was any different before the STC’s reform in 2010.

As to whether the STC is applicable to the gross revenues obtained from the sale of
hydrocarbons alone, its statutory provisions are, again, broadly dispositive of the
issue. Since its adoption in 2005 the STC has been applicable to the gross revenues
obtained from the exercise of the activities established in the “Hydrocarbons

[Law]’.'737 In the absence of a substantiated explanation to the contrary by the
interested Party, namely, the Claimants, the Tribunal finds that the STC’s subject-
matter scope covers more than just the revenues obtained from the sale of
hydrocarbon.

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal determines that the STC must be applied
to the ex post scenario as calculated by the Respondents.

Post-award interest

The Claimants request “post-award compound interest at a rate to be fixed by the
Tribunal”.75° The Respondents do not seem to dispute the possibility of allowing
post-award interest.

In consideration of the second tranche of Article 530 of the VCoC,1”°° the Tribunal
thus finds it apposite to compound post-award interest over the amount awarded to
the Claimants under the DA provisions of the AAs (already incorporating pre-award
interests at the contractually agreed rates). That, however, does not mean that post-
award interests in and of themselves can or must be allowed to independently accrue
on a compounded basis. To the contrary, given that the simple interest on the lost
cash flows are predicated on the Respondents’ belated compliance with their
indemnity obligations under the DA provisions (i.e. delayed payment), the Tribunal
finds no reason “to differentiate between the [interest] rate [and conditions] applicable
to [the] delayed payment of damages prior to or after the [a]lward”.174°

The Tribunal shall therefore grant post-award interest, on a simple interest basis, to
run from 27 May 2016 in accordance with the AUVM'”41 and until the date of full and
final payment of the awarded amounts at: (i) 12-month LIBOR in relation to the lump
sum (including interest) awarded pursuant to the Petrozuata AA; and (ii) 3-month
LIBOR in relation to the lump sum (including interest) awarded pursuant to the
Hamaca AA.

Methodology for calculating net present value of equity

In order to calculate the net present value of equity for the DA claim in the post-date
of valuation period, Mr. Abdala applies the “free cash flows to equity” (FCFE) method
of valuation.'”4? By contrast, the Respondents apply a “free cash flows to firm” (FCFF)
method of valuation. On balance, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants’ approach is to
be preferred. As the Claimants rightly point out, applying the Respondents’
methodology results in a situation where the Projects become uneconomical on a
post-tax basis starting from 2015 and become permanently loss making in and
around 2023 (Petrozuata) and 2027 (Hamaca).1743

Moreover, the models appear to assume that despite the permanent losses suffered
by the Projects, they will continue to run until the end of their contract terms, thereby
reducing the value of the Projects even further.'’4 The Tribunal finds that this
assumption does not comport with the manner in which any rational commercially
driven operator would run the Projects. While the Claimants dispute that the
Respondents had commercial incentives, the Tribunal has previously concluded that
this is not the case. Moreover, at least the Hamaca Project also involved a
“commercial minded entity” comparable with the Claimants (i.e. Chevron). It is
arguable that irrespective of the Respondents, it is not likely that Chevron would have
remained involved with a loss making enterprise. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that
the Claimants’ method of calculating the net present value of equity on the basis of
the FCFE should be applied.

Working Capital, depreciation and other revenues

In this section, the Tribunal addresses certain remaining DCF inputs on which the
Parties’ experts differ, namely, working capital requirements and depreciation.

Working capital refers to the amount of cash that a company needs to retain to
ensure the sound operation of its business on a day to day basis (as opposed to

1742 Free cash flow to equity is a measure of cash flow available to the equity holders of the asset, whereas free
cash flow to the firm is a measure of cash flow available to the firm (i.e., to all its stakeholders — equity and debt

distribution to the company’s equity and debt holders). It is defined as current assets

less current liabilities.1745

1114. Mr. Abdala forecasts working capital by taking a simple average of values
representing the ratio between working capital and relevant cash flow accounts
(revenues, operating expenses, capital expenditure, or royalties) for the historical
period.'’46 The Respondents’ experts, Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores, follow the same
methodology but substitute their inputs (for revenues, OPEX, CAPEX etc.)

instead.1747

1115. Depreciation is an accounting mechanism whereby certain expenditures are not fully
deducted against income in the year in which they are incurred, but deducted over a
period of several years at a certain rate, i.e. certain portion of their value is deducted
year on year.'748 Depreciation is deducted from operating expenses in order to arrive
at the net taxable income.

1116. Mr. Abdala states that he depreciates and amortizes expenses on the basis of the
methodology followed in the Projects’ financial statements. Depreciation of property,
plant, and equipment is computed according to the “unit of production” methodology,
which considers the ratio of production to the aggregate remaining hydrocarbons until
the end of the term of the concession. The upgrader facilities are depreciated on the
basis of a straight-line methodology over a period of 17 years. Intangible assets are

amortized using a straight-line approach.1749

1117. According to Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores, the methodology followed by Mr. Abdala
is not supported by the financial statements of the Project available on record.175°
They point to the 2005/2006 financial statements of the Petrozuata Project which
allegedly follow a different depreciation methodology. For instance, “assets used in

1745 Abdala ER |, CER-3, § 227; Brailovsky & Flores ER |, RER-3, § 220. Brailovsky and Flores explain that an
increase in working capital from one year to the next represents a decrease in the cash that can be distributed to
the company’s equity and debt holders, while a decrease in working capital is a release of tied-up cash, thus
increasing the cash that can be distributed to the company’s equity and debt holders.

1749 Abdala ER |, CER-3, § 226. As per Mr. Abdala’s methodology, all assets are fully depreciated by the end of
the concession period. This means that if the useful life of any asset is longer than the remaining years of the AAs,
the asset is depreciated at a faster rate than the rate corresponding to its actual useful remaining life.

the production of hydrocarbons are amortized or depreciated using the unit of
production method based on proved developed reserves estimated for the 35-year

operating life of the [AA]’, “assets related to pipeline investments are depreciated
using the straight-line method over a period of 23 years”, “capitalized costs of all
other support equipment and facilities are depreciated on a straight-line method over

an average estimated useful life of five years”.175"

In light of the above, Mr. Brailovsky and Mr. Flores reject the straight-line
methodology which assumes a 17 year useful life for the upgrader facilities. Instead
they depreciate the Projects’ assets on the basis of the methodology that is followed
in the 2005/2006 financial statements. They depreciate assets used in the production
of hydrocarbons and in the transformation of hydrocarbons using the unit of
production method. They depreciate turnaround CAPEX using a straight-line method
over 4-year periods and all other CAPEX for supporting equipment and facilities using
Mr. Abdala’s methodology. ‘752

Having examined the Parties’ submissions and the supporting documents, the
Tribunal finds that the key issue in dispute pertains to the methodology to be followed
for depreciating the Projects’ assets. In particular, the disputed issue concerns how
the upgrader should be depreciated. Although Mr. Abdala has stated that he applies
the depreciation methodology in the Projects’ financial statements, he has not
supported this statement with documentary evidence. In fact, having examined the
Petrozuata Project's financial statements, the Tribunal notes that none of them point
to depreciation over a 17 year period as alleged by Mr. Abdala.'’5° Rather, these
financial statements reflect the methodology applied by the Respondents and
constitute sufficient basis for the same to be accepted. In any event, the Tribunal
notes that despite the Respondents’ opposition to his calculation of depreciation, Mr.
Abdala ultimately opines that the differences in calculation of these DCF inputs “does
not give rise to material valuation differences”.'™ Thus Mr. Abdala appears to accept
the Respondents’ calculation of depreciation will not produce significantly erroneous
results. In the circumstances, the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondents’
calculations of depreciation should be accepted.

revenue, OPEX and CAPEX. Even in this respect, Mr. Abdala opines that the
differences in calculation do not give rise to material valuation differences. Hence, the
Tribunal considers it appropriate to adopt the Respondents’ working capital
estimates.

Tax net award

The Claimants submit that, “[b]ecause Dr. Abdala’s DCF calculation takes account of
all applicable Venezuelan taxes, no further Venezuelan taxes should be payable on
this Tribunal’s Award. [A]ny taxation of the Award would result in Claimants
impermissibly being taxed twice for the same income”.1755

In this regard, “in order to ensure the finality of the Tribunal’s Award, secure full
reparation under Venezuelan law, and prevent double taxation”,'”°° the Claimants
request: (i) for the award to be net of all applicable Venezuelan taxes; and (ii) for the
Tribunal to hold that any taxes applying under Venezuelan law to the payment of the
award to be borne by the Respondents.'75” In short, the Claimants request for the
“amount effectively received [...] after deduction of all applicable taxes corresponds to
the full amount granted by the Tribunal”.175°

The Tribunal notes that the Claimants’ argument is premised on the assumptions
germane to their Willful Breach Claim. Indeed, it is under that claim that the Claimants
have instructed their quantum expert to “assume that all taxes imposed by Venezuela
on the Projects would apply in the but for scenario, with the exception of the
[SPEC]’.*7°° On the other hand, under their DA Claim the Claimants have instructed
their quantum expert to exclude the Royalty Measure, the Extraction Tax, the Income
Tax Increase, the SOCO, and the SPAT.'7©° Further, Mr. Abdala has assumed that
the ADCO would not have applied to the Hamaca AA, an assumption that the
Claimants endorse.176"

Nevertheless, the Tribunal has determined that all of the taxation measures at issue
are either applicable or not applicable in the but-for world, or constitute (or would
have constituted) DAs. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that, in light of its
determinations, the Claimants’ DA Claim stands on par with their Willful Breach in this
regard: the amount awarded is net of taxes. To that extent, the Tribunal agrees with
the Claimants that applying taxes to the amount awarded would undermine the
principle of full compensation and would allow, in part, impermissible double
taxation.’ The Tribunal further notes that the Respondents do not seem to have
opposed the Claimants’ request either in their written submissions or during the
Hearing. Therefore, the Tribunal shall grant the Claimants’ request for a tax net
Award.

Reimbursement to the Respondents

The Tribunal recalls that the Claimants have clarified that they do not seek double
recovery for the damage suffered. In the context of their DA Claim in particular, the
Claimants have stated the following:

[Alny monetary reparation (after deduction of legal and expert costs incurred in
connection therewith) that the ICSID Claimants actually recover (i.e., awarded
and paid by Venezuela) in the ICSID Arbitration, before recovery in this ICC
proceeding, will reduce Respondents’ liability in respect of the claims asserted
in this ICC proceeding, to the extent that such reparation is based on the same
actions by the Government and/or PDVSA. The converse is true as well. If
Claimants receive payment for damages or indemnification in connection with
this ICC proceeding and are later awarded monetary reparation in connection
with the ICSID Arbitration (to the extent that such damages are based on the
same actions by the Government and/or PDVSA), Claimants will reimburse
Respondents for the amount that Respondents have paid in this ICC
Arbitration, after deduction of Claimants’ legal and expert costs, to the extent
necessary to prevent double recovery.'76

The Claimants clarify, however, that “the ICSID Tribunal has found that it could not
award compensation under the BIT for these pre-dispossession fiscal measures due
to a carve-out for tax measures in the BIT. As a result of that ruling in the ICSID
Arbitration, these ICC proceedings are the only viable recourse for Claimants’ losses
flowing from the Royalty Increase, the Extraction Tax, and the Income Tax Increase,
presented as part of the DA Claim”.1764

CONCLUSION (APPLICATION OF THE AUVM)

As established at the very outset, the Tribunal shall ascertain the amounts owed to
the Claimants under the DA provisions in accordance with the ex post date-of-award
valuation provided in the Abdala Updated Valuation Model (with a valuation date of
27 May 2016 as the most appropriate proxy for the date of the Award).176 In light of
the Tribunal’s determinations on the multiple issues in dispute, the present section
sets out the way in which the Tribunal has toggled the various inputs of the AUVM.
When relevant, the Tribunal also explains the edits made to the AUVM in order to
reflect some of its findings on both liability and quantum.

The following step-by-step explanation thus attempts to reflect the order in which
every issue has been dealt with in the present Award as per the AUVM. For the sake
of clarity, the headings, subheadings, and terms in quotations expanded below are
entitled as they appear in the AUVM’s Control Panel, or in the AUVM generally. When
necessary, reference is also made to the term or terms most used in this Award
identifying said heading or subheading:

i. Preliminary Matters

a) “Willful Breach Damages Percentage”: The Tribunal has rejected
the Claimants’ Willful Breach Claim in its entirety. As such, this
option has been set to “0%”.

£

“Petrozuata DA Compensation”: The Tribunal has set this toggle
to “From 2007”. However, the Tribunal has established elsewhere
that the Claimants are only entitled to receive compensation under
the DA provisions of the Petrozuata AA from 2007 onwards with
respect to the Expropriation. In turn, the Tribunal has determined
that, pursuant to Section 9.07(e) of the Petrozuata AA, the Claimants
may only receive compensation with respect to the Income Tax
Increase as from 2013 (i.e. the fiscal year before the initiation of this
arbitration).'7°° The AUVM's Control Panel does not allow making the
foregoing distinction. However, pursuant to its finding, the Tribunal
has edited the AUVM’s “DA FCF (PZ)” tab accordingly. In particular,
the Tribunal has altered the Cells S22 to X22 of said tab, by

1765 Supra, §§ 581 ss .
1766 Supra, § 294.xi.

425

replacing the references to Cells D22 and E22 with “50.5%” and
“51.5%”, respectively.

ii. “Production Volumes”
a) “Petrozuata”: This toggle has been set to “B&F”.1767
b) “Hamaca”: This toggle has been set to “B&F”.176

c) “Upgrader Failure (Hamaca)”: This toggle has been set to
“Abdala”.1769

iii. “Prices”

a) “Brent Price”: This toggle has been set to “B&F”. However, the
Tribunal has determined that the Respondents’ calculations on this
input cannot be taken wholesale. While the Tribunal finds that the
Respondents’ Brent price projections up to 2020 are apposite, it has
deemed unreasonable their assumption of a nominally flat Brent
price of USD 67.50 per barrel from 2021 until the expiration of both
Projects. Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided to apply a yearly 2%
inflation rate to the Respondents’ post-2020 Brent forecast.17”° The
AUVM's Control Panel does not allow the foregoing distinction. To
reflect its finding the Tribunal has thus edited the AUVM’s “Price
Inputs” tab. In particular, the Tribunal has edited Cells U7 (year
2021) to AK7 (year 2037), by increasing by 2% the Brent price
projected for the year before.

b) “Maya Differential”: This toggle has been set to “B&F”.177!
However, the Tribunal has edited the AUVM’s “Price Input” tab to
better reflect the Respondents’ position on the applicable Brent-
Maya differential. In particular, the Tribunal has edited Cell D10 of
said tab, by replacing the “85.88%” with a “85.89%”. This has the
effect of altering Cell G10 of the AUVM’s “DA Price” tab, which,

subsequent to the Tribunal’s edit, reflects a 14.11% Brent-Maya
differential (as argued by the Respondents),'”’* as opposed to a
14.12% differential (as appears in the AUVM as filed by the

Claimants).

“Project Crude Oil Prices”: This toggle has been set to “B&F”.1773
However, in order to better reflect the Respondents’ position on the
applicable Maya-Petrozuata CCO and Maya-Hamaca CCO
differentials, the Tribunal has carried out certain edits to the AUVM.
In particular, the Tribunal has edited the AUVM’s “Price Input” tab by
replacing the “100.09” in Cell D16 with a “100.08%”, and the
“98.37%” in Cell D15 with a “98.36%”. This in turn alters Cells G18
and G15 of the “DA Price” tab, by reflecting a 100.08% Maya-
Petrozuata CCO differential (as argued by the Respondents),'’”4 as
opposed to a 100.09% differential (as appears in the AUVM as filed
by the Claimants), and a -1.64% Maya-Hamaca CCO differential (as
argued by the Respondents),'’”> as opposed to a -1.63% differential
(as appears in the AUVM as filed by the Claimants).

“Other Product Prices”: This toggle has been set to “Abdala’.
However, the Tribunal has determined that the Respondents’ LPG
calculations are more reliable than the Claimants’.'’’° Given that the
AUVM’s Control Panel does not distinguish between the various by-
products sold by the Projects (the foregone volumes of which are
only compensable under the Petrozuata AA),'’”? the Tribunal has
edited Cell F29 of the AUVM’s “DA Price” tab by changing the
Claimants’ LPG differential from 74.49% to 57.86%.

pursuant to the DA provisions of the AAs amounts to: (i) USD 489,334,468.87, under
the Petrozuata AA; and (ii) USD 1,496,712,745.85, under the Hamaca AA. As such,
the total compensation owed to the Claimants as a result of the Income Tax Increase
and the Expropriation amounts to USD 1,986,047,214.72. In accordance with the

AUVM and the Claimants’ Prayer for Relief, the foregoing amounts are calculated as
of 27 May 2016 and already include pre-award interest.179°

cosTs

Each Party contends that all costs incurred in this arbitration, including the fees and
expenses of legal representation, experts, witnesses and party representatives, the
fees and expenses of the Tribunal, as well as the ICC administrative expenses should
be borne by the other side.179”

The Claimants submit that a full award of costs in their favour is warranted in light of
the Respondents’ conduct in these proceedings. In particular, they argue that the
Respondents’ approach to document production was abusive as they (i) refused to
produce documents relevant to establishing the nexus between the Government and
PDVSA in the period leading up to the Expropriation, as well as (ii) made
“burdensome, irrelevant, immaterial, and overlapping document production requests”
to the Claimants. 17°

The Claimants also argue that the Respondents’ strategy of obscuring the issues in
the arbitration similarly warrants an award of costs in the Claimants’ favor. In this
context, they point to the fact that (i) the Respondents refused to produce either Mr.
Ramirez as a witness or the documents in his possession, even though the crux of
the Respondents’ defense to the Willful Breach Claims was the alleged separation
between his roles as Minister and President of PDVSA,1”°9 and (ii) the Respondents’
“ploated and repetitive” pleadings in this arbitration coupled with their “frivolous” line
of questioning regarding the alleged “value-cap” applicable to the Projects during the
Hearing amounted to a waste of time.18°

Finally, the Claimants also observe that the Respondents’ unsuccessful bifurcation
requests caused unnecessary delays in the proceedings.'®"

In their submissions on costs,'®° the Claimants request the following amounts:

1796 For the sake of further precision, the Tribunal notes that it formated Cells F28 to H28 of the AUVM’s Control
Panel in order to reflect 8 decimals (as opposed to 0 decimals as originally filed). This way, the results in the
AUVM's Control Panel better represent the model's underlying data.

TOTAL COSTS CLAIMED 15,453,568.79

 

1135. In contrast, the Respondents argue that:

Given (i) the extraordinary delay of Claimants in bringing these claims after
never mentioning them for a decade; (ii) the claims’ total lack of merit, including
the fact that Claimants themselves, despite all their bluster about royalty and
tax measures, assert no [Willfull Breach Claims] for those measures, and, with
respect to the [DA Claims], actually concede that the first two measures do not
constitute “Discriminatory Actions”; and (iii) Claimants’ strategy of grossly
exaggerating virtually all elements of quantum while at the same time
pretending to be “conservative”, all costs of this Arbitration should be assessed

against Claimants.'®°4

1136. As to the Claimants’ arguments regarding the Respondents’ alleged strategy of

obscuring the issues in the arbitration, the Respondents had observed in turn that the

Claimants withheld documents in their possession. Such documents would have

supported their interpretation of the compensation structure of the Projects, i.e., that

the DA provisions capped the overall compensation that could be recovered by the

Claimants for any breach of the AAs. Accordingly, the Respondents requested the

Tribunal to draw an adverse inference against the Claimants in that regard.

1137. Furthermore, in response to the Claimants’ argument that the Respondents failed to

produce Mr. Ramirez as a witness or “internal PDVSA documents [...] relating to the

‘conception and formulation’ of the [E]xpropriation”,18°> the Respondents emphasized

 

1802 Fees and Expenses of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP of 17 April 2017; Fees and Expenses incurred

Three Crowns Costs Letter of 16 June 2017.

1803 The Claimants have indicated that the fees charged by three of their expert witnesses, i.e. Prof. Brewer-
Carias, Prof. Mata Borjas, and Prof. Mares form part of the expenses claimed by their counsel (see Fees and
Expenses incurred by the Claimants of 28 June 2017, fn 1; Fees and Expenses of Three Crowns LLP of 17 April
2017, § 2). In order to reflect the Parties’ break-up of costs in a similar manner, the Tribunal has reflected the fees
charged by the experts separately and deducted the total amount charged by Prof. Brewer-Carias, Prof. Mata

Borjas, and Prof. Mares from the expenses claimed by the Claimants’ counsel.

that “there are no internal PDVSA documents or documents exchanged with the
Government relating to the ‘conception and formulation’ of the expropriation, as
PDVSA and the other Respondents played no role in that decision.”®° The
Respondents thus resist the Claimants’ allegation that they have “obscured the
issues in this arbitration” by not producing relevant documents in their possession.

1138. Accordingly, in their submissions, '®” the Respondents claim the following costs:

1139. With due regard to the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal will first set out the relevant
legal provisions on costs under the AAs and the Guarantees, the ICC Rules, and the
lex arbitri, and then proceed to assess the allocation of costs under these rules.

1806 R-PHB, fn. 625; Reply, § 53; Tr. (Day 1), 140:14-141:23 (Respondents’ Opening Submissions), Mr. Kahale:
“Finally, a word about documents. They keep saying that there must be a ton of documents internal to PdVSA or
exchanged between PdVSA and the Government formulating the nationalization. | mean, that's completely silly.
My experience is a little bit different from Mr. Paulsson's. In fact, many times, nationalizations don't take ten years
in the making. Many times they actually do happen relatively quickly. [...] Let's take a look at how the
nationalization--the first mention of nationalization came about here [...] it's not Mr. Ramirez who is telling Mr.
Chavez what to do, it's the other way around [...] There are no documents internal to PdVSA formulating the
nationalization. Right after that, he went to Congress, President Chavez did, asked for an Enabling Law,
Congress gave him the Enabling Law, and Decree Law 5.200 was issued, and then PdVSA comes in to
implement that Decree. There are no documents. There are no negative inferences to be made. PdVSA was not
involved in formulating the nationalization. It was President Chavez who instructed the nationalization. And,
thereafter, there was implementation”.

1807 Respondents’ Counsel's Letters of 17 April 2017 and of 27 April 2017.

1808 The Tribunal notes that at the time of making their Cost Submissions in April 2017, both Parties had claimed a
sum of USD 1,030,000 towards the advance on costs paid to the ICC to cover the fees and expenses of the
Arbitral Tribunal, the expenses of the Tribunal Secretary, and the ICC administrative fees. Following the Parties’
Cost Submissions, in May 2017, the ICC requested a further advance on costs of USD 280,000 from each of the
Parties. In light of this request, and having paid an amount of USD 280,000 to the ICC in June 2017, the
Claimants amended their costs submissions to include the aforesaid amount (See Three Crowns Costs Letter of
16 June 2017; Fees and Expenses incurred by the Claimants of 28 June 2017). Similarly, the Respondents paid
the said advances of USD 280,000 on 13 September 2017 (See ICC Letter and Financial Table of 13 September
2017). However, the Respondents have not filed a similarly amended Costs Submission to reflect such payment.
In the circumstances, and as this reflects the correct position on advances paid to the ICC, the Tribunal has
included the USD 280,000 in the Respondents’ costs claim under the category “Fees and expenses of the
Tribunal and the Tribunal Secretary’.

Relevant legal provisions on costs
a. The AAs and the Guarantees

The AAs and Guarantees both contain provisions on the Tribunal’s authority to award

costs.

As further discussed below, the arbitration clause in Section 13.16 of the Petrozuata
AA is silent as to the allocation of costs. However, Section 13.06(a) of the Petrozuata
AA provides that:

All costs, legal fees and other expenses incurred by each Party in connection
with the preperation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of this
Agreement or any Business Contract shall be for the account of, and paid by,
such Party.1809

Further, the Petrozuata Guaranty stipulates that “PDVSA shall [...] indemnify Conoco
against all reasonable expenses and attorneys’ fees that may be incurred by Conoco
in enforcing such obligations and liabilities of [Respondent PDVSA Petrdleo] and in
enforcing the covenants and agreements of PDVSA contained herein.”

The Hamaca AA contains similar provisions and provides in Article 17.6 as follows:

The costs of the arbitration proceedings (other than costs of arrangements for
translations), including attorneys’ fees and costs, shall be borne in the manner
determined by the arbitral tribunal.181"

The Hamaca Guarantee further provides that “[t]he cost of the arbitration (other than
costs related to translation arrangements), including attorneys’ fees and costs, will be
assumed in the manner specified by the arbitration court.”"8'2

b. The ICC Rules

Turning to the allocation of costs under the ICC Rules, the relevant provisions are set
out in Article 37, which provides as follows:

1) The costs of the arbitration shall include the fees and expenses of the
arbitrators and the ICC administrative expenses fixed by the Court, in
accordance with the scale in force at the time of the commencement of the
arbitration, as well as the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the
arbitral tribunal and the reasonable legal and other costs incurred by the parties
for the arbitration.

1810 Petrozuata Guranty, C-2, Section 3.
‘811 Hamaca AA, C-3, Article 17.6.

1812 Hamaca Guarantee, C-4, Clause 13.

433

2

The Court may fix the fees of the arbitrators at a figure higher or lower than that
which would result from the application of the relevant scale should this be
deemed necessary due to the exceptional circumstances of the case.

3

At any time during the arbitral proceedings, the arbitral tribunal may make
decisions on costs, other than those to be fixed by the Court, and order
payment.

4) The final award shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the
parties shall bear them or in what proportion they shall be borne by the parties.

2

In making decisions as to costs, the arbitral tribunal may take into account such
circumstances as it considers relevant, including the extent to which each party
has conducted the arbitration in an expeditious and cost-effective manner.

1146. These provisions confirm the Tribunal’s authority to (i) decide which of the parties
shall bear the costs or in what proportion they shall be borne, and (ii) determine the
criteria which the Tribunal may take into consideration when coming to such costs
determination.

c. Lex Arbitri

1147. Lastly, under the /ex arbitri, i.e. New York law, subject to the parties agreeing to the
contrary, “the arbitrator’s expenses and fees, together with other expenses, not
including attorney's fees, incurred in the conduct of the arbitration, shall be paid as
provided in the award.”'813

2. Analysis

1148. The relevant legal provisions above accord to the Tribunal wide discretion in
determining the allocation of costs of the arbitration, including legal fees and
expenses. That said, such discretion should of course be exercised with care and
with due regard to the relevant criteria.

1149. In this respect, both Parties agree that the key principle governing the allocation of
costs in international commercial arbitration is that costs “follow the event i.e. for the
costs to be borne by the unsuccessful party”.'*'4 Thus, “[a] claimant that succeeds in
its primary claim, which took up much of the time and effort of the arbitration, may be
entitled to recover a substantial portion of its costs, even if it fails on a number of
secondary or ancillary claims. Similarly, if a claimant succeeds with its major liability
claim and is awarded a significant amount of damages sought under that claim, then
it is reasonable to conclude that the claimant was in essence the successful party and

is entitled to be treated as such.”'®'5 Conversely, if the claimant is unsuccessful in its
primary and major liability claim, it is not entitled to recover a significant portion and/or
its entire claim for costs.

Thus, in a nutshell, both Parties agree*®'® that in determining the allocation of costs,
the Tribunal may take into consideration “the relative success or failure of the parties
[...] by: (i) assuming that if a claimant or respondent succeeded in its core or primary
claim or outcome, then it is entitled to all of its reasonable costs; (ii) apportioning
costs on a claim-by-claim or issue-by-issue basis according to relative success and
failure; or (iii) apportioning success against the amount of damages originally claimed

or the value of the property in dispute.”181”

In addition to the above, another factor that the Tribunal may take into consideration
is the manner in which the Parties have conducted the case, keeping in mind the
complexity of the case that a party has prosecuted/defended.

With these considerations in mind, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants have not
prevailed on their primary claim, namely the Willful Breach Claims, quantified at USD
17.89 billion. Nor have the Claimants succeeded in establishing the entirety of their
DA Claims as a consequence of (i) the Royalty Measure and the Extraction Tax not
constituting DAs and thus not contributing to the Claimants’ losses; and (ii) the lack of
proper notice of the DAs by the Claimants under the Petrozuata AA. At the same
time, the Claimants legitimately and by no means in bad faith initiated arbitration
proceedings, successfully established that the Income Tax Increase and the
Expropriation itself constituted DAs under the AAs, entitling them to compensation.
Moreover, the Claimants demonstrated that the Respondents did not perform the AAs
as of the date of the Expropriation, even if that claim was ultimately unsuccessful due

to lack of causality.

On the other hand, the Respondents admitted that the Expropriation constituted a DA
under the AAs. They were also found liable to compensate the Claimants for the
Income Tax Increase (although for a reduced amount than what was claimed). In
addition, the Respondents did not prevail on their counterclaim under the Hamaca AA

for the buy-out of the Claimants’ Project interest.

On the other hand, the Respondents successfully defended the Willful Breach
Claims, which have been dismissed in their entirety.

The Tribunal also observes that, as evidenced by the preceding sections of this
Award, this case has raised several complex legal and factual questions, the
determination of which has not been a straightforward exercise. In that regard, the
Tribunal would like to acknowledge the well-reasoned and detailed pleadings of both
Parties, as well as the skilled presentation of the Parties’ cases by their respective
Counsel during the Hearing. These have greatly aided the Tribunal in its task of
determining the final outcome of this case. In general, the Tribunal considers that
both sides conducted this arbitration fairly and professionally, and avoided conduct
(such as acting in bad faith or raising irrelevant or spurious arguments) that would
justify an allocation of costs in favor of one Party.'®"® Similarly, both Parties conducted
the arbitration with the same professional ethics and dedication, as also reflected by
the similarity of costs claimed by each Party.

Having regard to these circumstances, the Tribunal is of the view that the relative
success and failure of the Parties on the various claims and issues raised in this
arbitration is very evenly balanced. As such, the Tribunal is of the view that it would
be appropriate, just and fair for each Party to bear its own legal fees, costs and
expenses, including the expenses related to its expert and fact witnesses. As a result,
the question of any interest on the Parties’ legal fees and other costs does not arise.

Furthermore, the Tribunal is of the view that the costs of the Arbitration, including the
fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the expenses of the Tribunal’s Secretary as
well as the ICC administrative expenses, have to be evenly divided between the
Parties. In that regard, the Tribunal notes that up to a certain stage both Parties had
paid an equal sum of USD 1,310,000.00 towards advance on costs to the ICC.1819
However, following (i) the ICC’s further increase of advance on costs and (ii) the
Respondents’ non-payment of their share, the entire amount was paid by the
Claimants. Thus, as determined in the ICC’s letters of 27 and 30 March 2018, the

1818 The Tribunal acknowledges that the Claimants’ case on the Willful Breach Claims underwent an evolution
throughout this arbitration. In fact, it acquired its final form — namely the First Willful Breach Claim regarding
breach of the “reasonable commercial efforts” obligation and the Second Willful Breach Claim regarding the non-
performance of the AAs — only in the Claimants’ post-hearing submissions as a result of a new line of argument
that developed at the Hearing. Be that as it may, taking into account the Parties’ pleadings and arguments at the
Hearing, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants’ changing position did not detract from the overall efficient and
fair conduct of this case so as to warrant the allocation of costs in favour of the Respondents.

final amount of advance of costs paid by the Claimants amounts to USD 1,840,000,
while the final amount paid by the Respondents amounts to USD 1,310,000.

The ICC Secretariat holds a balance of USD 100,000, which it shall reimburse to the
Claimants. The Tribunal furthermore determines that, in order for the Claimants to
recover the amount paid above their share of the costs of the arbitration (i.e., USD
315,000), the Respondents shall reimburse the Claimants USD 215,000 that the
Claimants have paid on their behalf. The Tribunal also determines that to this sum
simple interest will accrue at 12-month Libor starting from the date of the Award.

Similarly, considering that the 4% of the Italian MCLF applied to the fees of co-
arbitrator Prof. Avv. Giardina corresponds to USD 32,400.00, and that such sum is to
be paid from the amount deposited solely by the Claimants in the Special Account
created and administrated for this purpose with the ICC, the Respondents are
requested to reimburse half of the amount in question (i.e. USD 16,200.00) to the
Claimants. The Tribunal also determines that to this sum simple interest will accrue at
12-month Libor starting from the date of the Award. The ICC will return to the
Claimants the sum remaining in the Special Account.

For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that it has paid due regard to the
fact that the Petrozuata AA and the Petrozuata Guaranty contained some provisions
regarding the Parties’ obligation to pay the costs, legal fees and expenses in
connection with, inter alia, “the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and
enforcement” of the obligations under the Petrozuata AA. In that respect, the
Petrozuata AA stipulates that each party shall bear its own costs, legal fees and
expenses.'82° On the other hand, the Petrozuata Guaranty stipulates that the costs,
legal fees and expenses incurred by the Claimants towards the enforcement of the
AA shall be indemnified/guaranteed by the Respondents. ‘821

However, as the Claimants have rightly observed, these provisions do not form part of
the respective arbitration clauses in the Petrozuata AA and the Petrozuata
Guaranty.'®22 Indeed, they appear to deal with costs more generally, as can be
ascertained from the fact that they also concern costs, legal fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the “preperation, execution, delivery, [and]

administration”"®*> of the Petrozuata AA. Accordingly, in the Tribunal’s view the
reference to costs incurred towards “enforcement” of the Petrozuata AA does not
pertain to cost assessment in arbitration which falls within the domain of the
Tribunal’s authority. The Tribunal thus finds that such a general provision on costs
does not curtail its authority and discretion to allocate costs as a result of these

arbitration proceedings.

The Tribunal’s above conclusion regarding the language and purpose of these
provisions is buttressed by the contrasting language of the costs provisions in the
Hamaca AA and the Hamaca Guarantee, both of which specifically refer to the “costs
of the arbitration”."®24 Thus, despite the contractual silence on this question under the
Petrozuata AA, it seems logical to conclude that if the Parties had intended for the
respective clauses in the Petrozuata AA and Guaranty to extend to arbitration costs,
they would have used appropriate language to this effect. In the circumstances, the
costs provisions in the Petrozuata AA and Guaranty do not impact or alter the
Tribunal’s decision to split the costs evenly, because the Claimants have been
partially unsuccessful in “enforcing the AAs”, which in turn has resulted in costs being
incurred by the Respondents in defending against these claims.
