I. INTRODUCTION

On 17 July 2012, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
[“ICSID”] received a request for arbitration [the “Request for Arbitration”]
submitted by Rusoro Mining Ltd [‘“Rusoro” or “Claimant”], a corporation
constituted in Canada, against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
[“Venezuela” or “Respondent” ].

The Request was made pursuant to the ICSID Additional Facility Rules of 10
April 2006 [“AF Rules”], and the Agreement between the Government of Canada
and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and
Protection of Investments, dated 1 July 1996 [the “BIT or Treaty”]'.

On 1 August 2012, the ICSID Secretary-General approved access to the
Additional Facility pursuant to Article 4 of the AF Rules, and registered the
Request for Arbitration pursuant to Articles 4 and 5 of the AF Rules. On the same
day, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Article 5(e) of the ICSID
Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules [Arbitration AF Rules”] invited the
Parties to proceed to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.

By letter of 2 October 2012, Claimant invoked the procedure for the constitution
of the Arbitral Tribunal established in Article 9 of the Arbitration AF Rules, i.e.,
one arbitrator appointed by each party, and the third arbitrator, who would serve
as President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties.

By letter of 9 October 2012, Claimant appointed Prof. Francisco Orrego-Vicuiia,
a national of Chile, as arbitrator. Prof. Orrego Vicuiia accepted his appointment
on 15 October 2012. By letter of 31 October 2012, Respondent appointed Judge
Bruno Simma, a national of Germany, as arbitrator. Judge Simma accepted his
appointment on 12 November 2012.

By e-mail of 15 November 2012, Claimant notified the ICSID Secretariat about
the parties’ efforts to reach an agreement on the identity of the President and
requested the ICSID Secretariat not to make any proposal or nomination in respect
of the President for a period to expire on 23 November 2012. By e-mail of 27
November 2012, Respondent notified the Centre that the Parties agreed to
continue to consult through 30 November 2012, requesting ICSID to refrain from
making any proposals or nomination in respect of the President until after that
date. By e-mail of 7 December 2012, Respondent notified the Centre about the
Parties’ agreement on a further extension through 14 December 2012.

By letter of 3 January 2013, Claimant informed ICSID that the Parties had agreed
to the appointment of Prof. Juan Ferndndez-Armesto as the President of the
Tribunal. Prof. Fernandez-Armesto, a national of Spain, accepted his appointment
as President of the Tribunal on 4 January 2013.

' Doc. C-102 — Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of
Venezuela for the Promotion and the Protection of Investments, signed on 1 July 1996 and entered into
force on 28 January 1998, hereinafter referred to as the Treaty or the BIT.

15

On 4 January 2013, ICSID informed the Parties that all of the arbitrators had
accepted their appointments and that, pursuant to Article 13(1) of the Arbitration
AF Rules, the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted, and the proceedings
to have begun on that date. Ms. Alicia Martin Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel, was
designated by the Secretary-General of ICSID to serve as the Secretary of the
Tribunal.

Henceforth, the Claimant and the Respondent will together be referred to as the
Parties. Further details on the Parties and their representatives can be found in
section II of the present Award.

On 24 January 2013, following the Tribunal’s constitution on 4 January 2013, the
ICSID Secretariat circulated a draft agenda and a draft procedural order to help the
Parties with the preparation for the first session. On 4 February 2013, the Claimant
submitted a joint procedural agreement, which was confirmed by the Respondent
on the same date.

  

By letter of 6 February 2013, the Respondent requested that Prof. Orrego Vicufia
provide additional information concerning the statement accompanying his
declaration. On 7 February 2013, ICSID transmitted to both Parties Prof. Orrego
Vicufia’s response, which was supplemented by letters of 16 February 2013 and 11
March 2013 following exchanges between the Parties regarding Respondent’s
above-mentioned request.

 

The Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by telephone conference on 8
February 2013. During the first session, the Tribunal addressed the items on the
draft procedural agenda and order as revised and agreed by the Parties, confirmed
the Parties’ agreements and decided on the points in dispute. The Parties confirmed

On 7 March 2013, the Tribunal circulated Procedural Order No. 1 containing the
Parties’ agreements and the Tribunal’s decisions, including a schedule of the
proceedings.

By letter of 15 March 2013, the Claimant notified the Members of the Tribunal
about the Parties’ agreement to extend the deadlines for submission of the Memorial
and the Counter-Memorial respectively, which the Tribunal confirmed on 18 March
2013.

The Claimant submitted its Memorial and accompanying materials on 21 March
2013.

On 28 March 2013, the Respondent filed a Proposal for the Disqualification of Prof.
Orrego Vicuiia and accompanying materials.

On 29 March 2013, the ICSID Secretariat informed the Parties that, in accordance
with Article 15(7) of the Arbitration AF Rules, the proceeding was suspended
pending the decision by the other two Members of the Tribunal regarding the
Proposal for the Disqualification of Prof. Orrego Vicujia.

On 18 April 2013, the Claimant filed its Response to the Respondent’s Proposal for
the Disqualification of Prof. Orrego Vicuiia and accompanying documents.

On 22 April 2013, the Respondent requested the other two Members of the Tribunal

to advise the Parties whether, despite the suspension of the proceeding, the Parties
were to abide by the original calendar with respect to their filings on bifurcation, as

21

provided for in Procedural Order No. 1. On 23 April 2013, the non-challenged
Members of the Tribunal acknowledged the Parties’ willingness to accelerate the
proceeding, confirmed the Parties’ proposal to adhere to the original calendar, and
invited the Parties to confirm by 24 April 2013 whether they agreed to the
transmission of the bifurcation request to Prof. Orrego Vicufia, despite the Proposal
for Disqualification being pending.

 

By email of 24 April 2013, the Respondent argued that it would be inappropriate to
transmit the filings on bifurcation to Prof. Orrego Vicuiia as well as for the Tribunal
to deliberate or adjudicate any filings while the proceeding was suspended to
consider the Proposal for Disqualification.

 

On the same date, the Respondent submitted its Request for Bifurcation and
accompanying documentation, pursuant to which it requested the Tribunal to
determine its jurisdiction as a preliminary matter.

  

On 29 April 2013, Prof. Orrego Vicufia submitted his comments to the Proposal for
Disqualification, pursuant to Article 15(4) of the Arbitration AF Rules. By emails
of 13 May 2013, the Parties submitted additional simultaneous comments to the
Proposal for Disqualification.

On 15 May 2013, the Claimant filed its response and accompanying documents to

Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation.

On 14 June 2013, Prof. Fernandez Armesto and Judge Simma issued their Decision
on the Proposal to Disqualify Prof. Orrego Vicufia. The Decision rejected the
Proposal for Disqualification.

 

On 16 July 2013, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Request for Bifurcation.
The Tribunal decided not to bifurcate pro tem, and reserved its right to revisit this
decision upon review of the Respondent’s full arguments on the jurisdictional
objections in its Counter-Memorial. With the same decision, the Tribunal also lifted
the suspension of the proceeding and invited the Parties to try to reach an agreement
regarding the new dates for the remaining submissions and to report to the Tribunal
by 29 July 2013. On 29 July 2013, the Parties notified their agreement concerning
the procedural calendar.

 

On 4 October 2013, following exchanges between the Parties and the Tribunal
about availability for possible hearing dates, the Tribunal and the Parties agreed on
the weeks of 8 December 2014 (for the first session of the hearing) and 19 January
2015 (for the second session of the hearing).

On 11 November 2013, the ICSID Secretariat transmitted to the Parties a request
by the President of the Tribunal to appoint Ms. Deva Villantia Gomez as an
Assistant to the Tribunal in this case. The Parties agreed to the appointment of Ms.
Villantia Gémez as Assistant to the Tribunal by emails of 13 November 2013 and
15 November 2013 respectively.

 

Following a request for an extension granted by the Tribunal, the Respondent filed
its Counter-Memorial and accompanying documents on 30 January 2013.

On 28 February 2014, the Parties exchanged document production requests in the
form of Redfern Schedules, pursuant to their agreement of 13 February 2014. On
17 March 2014, the Parties exchanged responses and objections to their respective
requests for the production of documents. The Parties produced non-disputed
documents on 20 March 2014. Following an agreed extension, on 28 March 2014,
both Parties submitted replies to their respective requests for production of
documents.

 

On 29 April 2014, the ICSID Secretariat notified the Parties that the Tribunal would
not be able to issue its decision within 20 days following the Parties’ respective
reply submissions as provided in Section 14(6) of Procedural Order No. 1, and that
a decision would be issued shortly.

 

On | May 2014, the Tribunal i:
the Parties’ respective requests

ued Procedural Order No. 2, in which it decided on
‘or production of documents.

 

 

On 12 May 2014, the Parties submitted their agreement to extent the time limit for
the submission of the Reply and Rejoinder. The agreement provided that the hearing
dates would be maintained.

On 23 May 2014, the Claimant submitted two letters: one addressed to the
Respondent concerning the Claimants’ production of documents pursuant to
Procedural Order No. 2; and another one seeking the Tribunal’s assistance in
relation to certain alleged deficiencies in Respondent’s production of documents
pursuant to the same order. Venezuela submitted a response on 28 May 2014
requesting that the Tribunal deny all of the Claimant’s requests contained in its
letter of 23 May 2014, to which the Claimant replied on 30 May 2014 seeking the
production of certain documents. After obtaining leave from the Arbitral Tribunal,
the Respondent submitted further observations on 4 June 2014. The Parties
exchanged further communications on this issue on 5 and 6 June 2015.

By letter of 10 June 2014, the Respondent sought clarification regarding the Parties’
different interpretations of the Tribunal’s decision on certain requests for document
production that had been formulated by the Respondent and addressed in Procedural
Order No. 2. Venezuela requested that the Tribunal order the Claimant to produce
certain documents in accordance with its interpretation of the Tribunal’s decision.
By letter of 18 June 2014, the Claimant responded requesting the Tribunal to
confirm its existing order and reject Venezuela’s request for production of what it
considered to be additional documents beyond the scope of the order. The Parties
exchanged further communications on this issue on 20 and 24 June 2014.

The Claimant filed its Reply and accompanying documents on 12 June 2014.

On 30 June and 8 July 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Orders Nos. 3 and 4
respectively, in which it addressed outstanding issues relating to document
production.

By letter of 15 July 2014, the Claimant sought permission from the Tribunal to
submit additional relevant evidence that was not available when it filed its Reply
on 12 June 2014. On 21 July 2014, following the Tribunal’s instructions, the
Respondent filed its observations with respect to the Claimant’s request. With the

Tribunal’s permission, the Parties submitted further comments on 23 and 28 July

The Tribunal issued its Decision on the Request for the Submission of New
Evidence on 15 September 2014.

On 25 September 2014, following a consultation with the Parties about availability
during the dates established for the second session of the hearing, the Tribunal and
the Parties confirmed the hearing dates as follows: 7-12 December 2014 (for the
first session of the hearing) and 2-4 February 2015 (for the second session of the
hearing).

   

 

Following an extension agreed by the Parties, on 13 October 2014, Venezuela
submitted its Rejoinder and accompanying materials.

With the submission of its Rejoinder, Venezuela noted that due to communication
issues it had not received one witness statement in time to file it with the Rejoinder.
Venezuela anticipated that it would receive it in the following days and submit it
by then. By letter of 16 October 2014 addressed to the Tribunal, the Claimant noted
that no statement from the unidentified witness had been submitted by Venezuela
by that date and requested that the Tribunal issue an order declaring the evidence
of Venezuela’s unidentified witness to be inad: ible. On 17 October 2014, the
Respondent requested permission by the Tribunal to include the witness statement
of former Minister of Basic Industries and Mining Mr. José Salamat Khan as part
of its Rejoinder. On 24 October 2014, the Claimant requested that Mr. Khan’s
statement be excluded from the record.

 

 

On 20 October 2014, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal issue an order
declaring that the witness statements of Mr. Ramon Calderén and Mr. José A. Ferrer
Monasterio, as well as the expert opinion of Mr. John G. Brim, were inadmissible
and that they be stricken from the record.

 

By letter of 29 October 2014, the Respondent addressed Claimant’s three previous
communications seeking the dismissal of the Claimant’s requests concerning the
witness statements of Messrs. Calderén, Ferrer and Khan, as well as the expert
opinion of Mr. Brim. On the same date, by means of a second letter, the Respondent
informed that Prof. Garcia Montoya, one of its expert witnesses, had become a
partner in a law firm with Venezuela’s local counsel on 22 September 2014, and
had thenceforth been retained as Venezuela’s counsel. The Respondent requested
that his legal opinion still be deemed appropriate, since it was issued prior to having
been retained as counsel. The Claimant reacted to Respondent’s second letter on 10
November 2014 seeking the exclusion of Prof. Montoya’s report from the record
or, should his report be retained, that Prof. Montoya be ordered to make himself
available for cross-examination at the hearing. The Respondent provided further
comments on 11 November 2014.

 

On 6 November 2014, the Respondent sought permission from the Tribunal to
present new evidence. Venezuela argued that the new evidence only came into its
possession after having submitted its Rejoinder. On 14 November 2014, the
Claimant did not object to the production of new evidence subject to certain
conditions [production of certain documents] and reserved its right to submit

24

responsive evidence once it had had the opportunity to review it. Further to the
production of the documents requested by the Claimant, on 29 November 2016
Venezuela requested that the new evidence be entered into the record.

On 10 November 2014, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal order Venezuela
to produce the documents listed in the Claimant’s request of 28 November 2014
addressed to the Respondent, to which Venezuela had responded on 7 November
2014. On 11 November 2014, Venezuela noted that it would have no objection to
this new request should the Claimant petition the Tribunal for leave to submit a
further document production request or should the Tribunal decide to treat
Claimant’s letter as such a petition. On 12 November 2014, the Tribunal informed
the Parties that it had no objection to further rounds of document production, in
accordance with Section 14(12) of Procedural Order No. 1.

On 12 November 2014, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Admissibility of
Evidence and Hearing Dates, in which it decided on the admissibility of the witness
statements of Messrs. Khan, Ferrer and Calderén and of the expert reports of
Messrs. Brim and Montoya. The Tribunal further addressed the need for an
additional hearing day and offered 1 February 2015. The Parties confirmed that
they wished to make use of the additional day on 19 November 2014. In light of the
Tribunal’s Decision of 12 November 2014, Respondent submitted the witness
statement of Mr. Khan on 14 November 2014 as part of its Rejoinder.

  

 

On 17 November 2014, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that Mr.
Rafael Bittencourt Silva would replace Ms. Deva Villantia as Assistant to the
Tribunal and that his appointment would be subject to the same terms as
Ms. Villantia’s.

 

On 19 November 2014, the Tribunal took note of the Parties’ agreement to have a
pre-hearing conference call. The Tribunal further noted that it had agreed that Prof.
Fernandez Armesto would take the conference call on behalf of the Tribunal.

On 19 November 2014, the Claimant submitted a document incorporating their
agreed procedural arrangements for the hearing, as well as the areas where the
Parties had been unable to reach an agreement. The Respondent submitted its
confirmation of the Parties’ agreement on 21 November 2014.

On 24 November 2014 and further to the Tribunal’s Decision of 12 November 2014,
the Claimant sought orders addressing certain specific evidentiary issues arising out
of Venezuela’s Rejoinder and accompanying witness statements.

 

The pre-hearing conference call was held on 25 November 2014. During the call,
the Parties addressed the points of disagreement concerning procedural
arrangements for the hearing as well as the Claimant’s application of 24 November
2014. The Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4A on 26 November 2014
containing the Parties’ procedural agreements and the Tribunal’s orders on these
issues. Pursuant to these agreements, on the same date Venezuela communicated
the additional documents and legal authority that it sought to enter into the record
prior to the first session of the hearing.

On 2 December 2014, the Claimant communicated to the Tribunal an agreement
reached by the Parties concerning document production procedure. The agreement
was confirmed by the Respondent on the same date. In accordance with this
agreement, (i) the Parties filed simultaneous submissions on 2 November 2014
concerning requests that had already been submitted to the Tribunal (namely, the
Parties’ respective communications of 24 and 26 November 2014); and (ii) the
Claimant submitted a letter to the Tribunal on 2 December 2014 concerning
requests that had so far been sent to Venezuela with no corresponding request to
the Tribunal reflecting the basis for its request, to which Venezuela responded on 3
December 2014. Further comments were sent by the Claimant on 3 December 2014.

 

  

On 4 December 2014, the Tribunal indicated that it was working to issue a
procedural order dealing with outstanding document production and procedural
issues, and requested that the Parties refrain from sending further communications
in this regard. Procedural Order No. 5 was issued on the same date.

On 5 December 2014, the Parties sought leave to submit a new documents into the
record. The Tribunal addressed pending and new procedural and evidentiary issues
during the first session of the hearing.

The first session of the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held in
Washington, D.C. from 7 December to 12 December 2014. In addition to the

procedural aspects concerning certain submissions ordered by the Tribunal (namely
the submi on the decision in Caso Motores de Venezuela C.A.

having reports from legal experts on the submissions ordered by the Tribunal and
decided that the Parties’ submissions on these issues should be sufficient.

 

 

On 23 January 2015, the Claimant sought orders from the Tribunal addressing
certain specific evidentiary issues arising out of the first session of the hearing
and/or Venezuela’s Rejoinder and accompanying documents. On 27 January 2015,
the Respondent requested that the Claimant’s requests be denied except in so far as
they concerned documents that had been previously requested by the Tribunal, and
reserved its rights to submit responsive documents should the Tribunal decide to
grant the Claimant’s requests.

 

On 28 January 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 addressing the

On 13 February 2015, Venezuela submitted a request to introduce a new document
into the record (the Mine Development Associates Report), which the Claimant

Order No. 7 rejecting Respondent’s request for lack of exceptional circumstances
or reasonable cause justifying its untimely introduction.

On 20 February 2015, the Claimant filed a Submission on the Decision by the
Constitutional Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court of 2 November 2011 in
the Motorvenca Case, and the Respondent filed a submission on the sanctions

On 2 April 2015, Venezuela notified the Tribunal that it was prepared to provide to
the Claimant copies of the Block Models given to BBA during its site visit to certain
properties at issue, and requested certain information from the Claimant concerning
information used to prepare various reports. The Claimant commented on
Respondent’s submission by letter of 15 April 2015 and requested that the Tribunal
disregard all submissions contained therein. On 5 May 2015, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 8 rejecting the submission of the Block Models for the time
being, with the possibility to request their submission after reviewing the Parties’
post-hearing briefs.

 

 

 

On 11 May 2015, the Parties communicated their agreement to seek a joint
extension of the deadline to submit their post-hearing briefs, to which the Tribunal
did not object. On 31 May 2015, the Parties agreed to a further extension of the
deadline, which was also approved by the Tribunal.

On 3 June 2015, each Party filed a post-hearing brief.
Following an agreed extension, on | July 2015, each Party filed a summary of costs.

Following the Tribunal’s request, on 23 May 2016, the Parties confirmed their
agreement that: (i) the Award be deemed to have been made at the place of
arbitration; (ii) the Members of the Tribunal need not sign the Award at the place
of arbitration; and (iii) neither Party will subsequently refuse compliance, seek to
challenge or refuse enforcement of the Award on any ground connected with the
place where the Award was signed.

The Tribunal declared the proceeding closed on 29 June 2016, in accordance with
Article 44(1) of the Arbitration AF Rules.

Rusoro is a public company existing under the laws of British Columbia, Canada,
with its head office in Vancouver’, its principal business activities being the
acquisition, exploration, development and operation of gold mineral properties.

Between 2006 and 2008 Rusoro acquired controlling interests in 24 Venezuelan
companies, which held a total of 58 mining concessions and contracts for the
exploration, development and exploitation of gold and other minerals in the south-
eastern Bolivar State [together, the “Mining Rights”.

These Mining Rights derive from:
- concessions granted by the Ministry of Energy and Mines [the “MEM”]°;

- contracts [“CVG Contracts”] entered into by the State-owned Corporacién
Venezolana de Guayana ["CVG”], and by CVG Minerven — Compaiiia
General de Minerfa de Venezuela C.A. [“CVG Minerven”], a company
controlled by CVG’;

- leasing agreements (the MEM granted concessions to the CVG, which were
then on-leased to companies controlled by Rusoro)*; and

- joint venture agreements between companies controlled by Rusoro and the
legal holders of CVG Contracts’.

The following section will detail Rusoro’s investment in gold mining in Venezuela,
explaining how it succeeded in acquiring 58 Mining Rights between 2006 and 2008.

BACKGROUND: FROM GRUPO AGAPOV TO RUSORO

In the early 2000s Vladimir Agapov and his son Andre Agapov, two Russian
businessmen, decided to invest in Venezuela through a Panamanian company called
Grupo Agapov Corp. [“Grupo Agapov’]!°.

In 2002 Grupo Agapov acquired control over a group of Venezuelan companies —
Inversora Maryate C.A., Minerfa MS, C.A. and Inversora Técnica de Minas
INTEMIN, C.A. — that held several gold exploration rights in the Sifontes
Municipality in Bolivar State, including in the Emilia, Virginia and Belkis Imining
areas.

Grupo Agapov further expanded its Venezuelan interests in 2003 by acquiring
control of a group of companies - LAMIN Laboreos Mineros, C.A., Corporacién

80.000, C.A. and Corporacién Cabello Galvez, C.A. — holding rights to explore the
San Rafael and El Placer [“SREP”] and Atlantida mining areas, also in Bolivar
State.

Grupo Agapov continued its expansion in 2005 by acquiring a majority interest
(76%) in Balandria Limited, a British Virgin Islands holding company that (through
the Venezuelan companies General Mining de Guayana, C.A., Krysos Mining, S.A.
and Corporaci6n Minera 410879, C.A.), owned the mining rights to the Increible 6,
Valle Hondo and Anaconda mining areas, near the town of El Callao in Bolivar
State. The minority partner of Grupo Agapov in this transaction was Mena
Resources Inc. [“Mena”].

Rusoro acquires Grupo Agapov

By 2006 the managing directors of Grupo Agapov decided that, in order to continue
with their expansion and development plans, a substantial capital injection was
required. To achieve this, Grupo Agapov decided to transform into a public listed
company on the TSX Venture Exchange!!. Thus, in November 2006 Grupo Agapov
merged with Newton Ventures (Panama) Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Rusoro, a Canadian corporation already listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (the
Claimant in these proceedings). As a consequence of the merger, a new company,
Rusoro Mining (Panama) Inc., was incorporated. The merger was structured as a
reverse takeover, whereby Grupo Agapov’s shareholders acquired a majority
shareholding in Rusoro. Vladimir Agapov was appointed Chairman of Rusoro’s
Board of Directors!”.

 

    
 
 

Through Rusoro Mining (Panama) Inc., Rusoro became the owner of Grupo
Agapov’s ten Venezuelan subsidiaries, which, in turn, held various Mining Rights
in Bolivar State:

A. Increible 6

General Mining de Guayana, C.A. held the mining rights to the Increible 6 area in
the El Callao Municipality. The rights to exploit gold in that area were held through
aconcession lease granted by CVG in 1991. The lease was to run for 20 years from
the publication of the certificate of exploitation, which had occurred in September
2009, with the possibility of extending the term for subsequent periods of up to ten
years!3,

  

B. SREP - San Rafael and EI Placer

LAMIN, Laboreos Mineros, C.A. had a CVG contract that authorized the

GOVERNMENT POLICY REGARDING MIN!

 

In 2005 President Chavez approved a general government policy, which implied
that in a time horizon of between 5 and 10 years, the State would assume control of
the gold (and diamond) mining activities. The approval of this policy is proven by
an internal document, the “Cuenta al Sefior Presidente de la Reptblica n° 11”,
submitted by the “Ministro del Ambiente y de los Recursos Naturales”, and
countersigned by President Chavez”. There is no evidence in the file whether this
policy was publicly announced at that time.

  
 

However, a year later in May 2006 the then “Ministro de Industria Ba s”, Mr.
Victor Alvarez published an article?’ in which he set forth the “Principios rectores
de la nueva politica minera venezolana”. The first principle was the suppression of
all mining concessions granted to private persons, and the incorporation of mixed
enterprises to carry out mining activities”*:

 

 

 

“Rescate de la soberanja nacional sobre los recursos minerales, metdlicos y no
metalicos. En 24 de octubre de 1829, Simén Bolivar expidié memorable
Decreto, en la ciudad de Quito, determinando que “la propiedad sobre las
minas de cualquier clase pasa del dominio de la Real Corona de Espaiia al
dominio de la Reptiblica”. Aunque conste en la Ley de Minas actual —
concebida bajo los principios de la Constitucién de 1961- el célebre mandato
del Libertador no ha sido respetado. Casi 177 afios después, el MIBAM
defiende la efectiva nacionalizacién de nuestras riquezas y la creacién de un

régimen transitorio, que sustituya las actuales concesiones mineras por
empresas mixtas. La palabra de orden es “No mas concesiones”.

 

The second principle was the abolition of “mining latifundia”, including those
owned by “private groups from Russia”, except for those companies “que trabajan
y cumplen apropiadamente sus funciones””?

“Erradicacién del latifundio minero. Estudios demuestran que el 71,1% de los
derechos mineros vigentes (cerca de 988.921 hectdreas) son latifundios
mineros y que un 20,3% se encuentra en manos de cuatro grandes grupos
privados de Venezuela, Rusia, Canadé y Holanda. El control de estas
importantes dreas por el Estado venezolano es de fundamental interés
estratégico: abarca los equilibrios social, politico, econémico, territorial,
internacional. Nuestra orientacién es intensificar la revisién de todos los
contratos, de todas las concesiones, activas o inactivas, otorgadas a
transnacionales 0 a grupos privados nacionales, para que el Estado asuma
soberanamente su absoluto control, respetando las empresas que trabajan y
cumplen apropiadamente sus funciones”.

The acquisition of Cradock gave Rusoro control over five additional Venezuelan
companies:

 

- Corporaci6n Minera Sor Teresita, C.A.,
- Inversiones Vipago, C.A.
- Inversiones Yuruan, C.A.
- Minera Tapaya, C.A. and

- Representaciones Carson Gold Int., S.A.

In March 2007 Rusoro further increased its portfolio of mining properties in
Venezuela through the acquisition of Mena. Mena held a 24% ownership interest
in General Mining de Guayana, C.A., Krysos Mining S.A. and Corporacién Minera
410879, C.A. (which were already 76% owned by Rusoro through the initial
acquisition of Balandria Limited by Grupo Agapov**). The transaction thus allowed
Rusoro to consolidate its control over these three subsidiaries and their mining
rights.

. The acquisition of Mena also resulted in Rusoro’s control of two additional

Venezuelan subsidiaries that were controlled by Mena:
- Corporacién Minera 6560433, C.A. and
- Inversiones Goldwana, C.A.

The two Venezuelan subsidiaries held mining rights in the following areas located
in Sifontes Municipality:

A. Angelito

RUSORO ACQUIRES GOLD FIELDS’ VENEZUELAN ASSETS

 

In October 2007 Rusoro purchased through a share deal the Venezuelan assets of a
South Africa-based gold mining company known as Gold Fields Limited [“Gold
Fields”]. This transaction made Gold Fields a 38% shareholder in Rusoro and gave
Rusoro control over Gold Fields’s subsidiaries in Venezuela, namely:

- Promotora Minera de Guayana P.M.G. S.A. [“PMG”];

- Corporacién Aurifera de El Callao, C.A.;

- Proyectos Mineros del Sur, PROMINSUR, C.A. [“Prominsur”];

The Venezuelan subsidiaries acquired by Rusoro through Gold Fields in turn held
mining rights in the following areas:

A. Choco 10 mine

The Choco 10 mine is located close to the gold mining town of El Callao in Bolivar
State. The mining rights over this area were first granted by the MEM to CVG in
1993 and were effective for 20 years*'. CVG in turn leased them to PMG, a
Venezuelan subsidiary of Bolivar Gold Corporation [“Bolivar Gold”]*?, which
initiated production at the mine in 2005**. In February 2006 Gold Fields had
acquired the rights to the Choco 10 site from Bolivar Gold.

The acquisition of the Choco 10 mine by Rusoro marked its transition from an
exploration company to a gold producer“.

B. Choco 4

. The concession over this area had been granted in 1993 by the MEM to CVG for a

period of 20 years*>. The Choco 4 concession had been leased by CVG to Bolivar
Gold in February 1994*.

C. Bochinche B1, Bochinche B2 and Bochinche Zero

 

Two concessions in relation to these areas had been granted in 1990 by the MEM
to CVG for the exploration and subsequent exploitation of several minerals for a
period of 20 years, from the publication of the certificate of exploitation (which had
still not happened at the time of the nationalization)’’. The Bochinche B1 and
Bochinche B2 concessions were leased by CVG to Bolivar Gold under a 1991 joint
lease agreement*®.

3. In June 1993 Bolivar Gold had also entered into a contract with CVG for the

exclusive exploration, development and exploitation of gold in the Bochinche Zero
area located in the Sifontes Municipality for a period of 20 years*®.

Purchase Agreement under which Rusoro indirectly acquired 100% of the issued
share capital in Hecla Limited’s Venezuelan assets [the “Hecla Transaction”]**.

129. This transaction granted Rusoro additional mining rights, as follows:
A. Bloque B - Isidora and Twin Shear Deposit

130. The mining rights to the Bloque B (which included the Isidora mine and the Twin
Shear deposit) had initially been granted through a concession to CVG Minerven

granted to Monarch Resources de Venezuela, C.A., between 1992-1993, for 20-
year periods, extendable for subsequent periods of ten years, to exploit gold and
diamonds in these areas**.

Minera Hecla also held a 50-year MEM concession to exploit gold in the Canaima
area in the Roscio Municipality that was due to expire in late 201359. This
concession had initially been granted to Ms. Dolores Herrera de Rassi and was
subsequently transferred to Suramericana de Mineria, S.A., which in turn
transferred it to Suramericana de Mineria II, C.A. (currently Minera Rusoro

. In order to approve the Hecla Transaction, the Government of Venezuela required

that the mining rights to be acquired by Rusoro operated through a joint venture, 50
% held by Rusoro and 50% held by the Government.

 

Thus, shortly after finalizing the Hecla Transaction, on 4 July 2008 Rusoro entered
into a joint venture agreement with the Venezuelan Government (through MIBAM)
[the “Commitment Agreement”]®! and formed Minera Venrus C.A. [“Wenrus”],
a joint venture 50% owned by Empresa de Produccién Social Minera Nacional
C.A., a company owned indirectly by MIBAM, and 50% owned by Rusoro Mining

THE VENEZUELAN GOLD AND EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS

At the time when Rusoro made its investments, the export of gold was regulated by
a Resolution of the Banco Central de Venezuela [“BCV”], No. 96-12-02 [1996
BCV Resolution’ ]*. The overarching principle established in this Resolution was
that of liberty of export:

“Articulo 1 — Se permiten las operaciones de exportacién de oro y sus
aleaciones, tanto amonedado como en barras, fundido o  refinado,
manufacturado o en cualquier otra forma, en los términos y condiciones
establecidos en la presente Resolucién”.

The only requirements for Venezuelan gold producers to export gold were®

- the registration of the gold producer at a special registry held by the BCV,

- a (non-discretionary) authorization of the BCV, and

- that at least 15% of the total production be sold in the private domestic market.

A. The 2003 exchange control regime

In 2003 the Bolivarian Republic was confronted with the situation that the reduction
in oil exports caused a shortage of foreign currency; as a reaction it decided to
impose an exchange control regime, in order to guarantee the stability of the
Venezuelan currency®. This was accomplished by way of a “Convenio” entered
into between the BCV and the Government of Venezuela, which was then published
in the Gaceta Oficial and became a binding rule of law [“Convenio Cambiario No.
vy".

The Convenio Cambiario No. | created a strict exchange control regime, with a
public agency, the Comisién de Administracién de Divisas [“CADIVI”] to
supervise and manage the system and to grant the requisite authorizations. The
general principles of the regime can be summarized as follows:

- The BCV is authorized to establish a fixed exchange rate between the VEF
and the USD (and other currencies) [the “Official Exchange Rate”];

- The system differentiates between public and private sector entities, the
former enjoying a more liberal regime: Petrdleos de Venezuela S.A

[“PDVSA”] and its affiliates are authorized to hold and to freely use foreign

 

Doc. C-101 — Resolution of the BCV No. 96-12-02 published in Gaceta Oficial No. 36.124 on 13 January
1997; this Resolution was complemented by an “Instructivo” dated 30 January 1997 (Doc. C-255).

§ Doc. C-101 — Resolution of the BCV No. 96-12-02, Arts. 2, 4 and 5.

& Doc. C-122 - Convenio Cambiario No. 1, Recitals, The first version of the Convenio Cambiario No. 1
was published on 5 February 2003; certain amendments were approved on 18 March 2003, and a revised
version was published on 19 March 2003; this is the version referred to in the text.

currency held in foreign accounts up to certain limits authorized by the
BCV®;

- For private persons the general rule is that all foreign currency holdings from
the export of any goods, services or technologies, have to be sold to the BCV
at the Official Exchange Rate®;

- The exporter can, however, retain up to 10% of the income received in foreign
currency to cover expenses connected with export activities, upon
authorization from CADIVI”;

- Purchase by private persons of foreign currency, for payment of imports or
for any other purpose, can only be made within the limits set forth by CADIVI
and subject to its authorization”!

Thus, in accordance with Convenio Cambiario No. 1, a private company operating
in Venezuela was obliged to sell its foreign currency to the BCV at the Official
Exchange Rate, and could only purchase the foreign currency required for its import
and other activities prior authorization of CADIVI and subject to CADIVI’S
discretionary authorization.

. Further to this official market, there was always the possibility of buying and selling

foreign currency against VEF through a parallel currency market. In essence, the
parallel market [known as the “Swap Market’’] implied the purchase of sovereign
bonds issued by Venezuela or its agencies in the domestic market in Venezuela, and
the subsequent swapping of these bonds against equivalent bonds traded in the
international market (or vice-versa). The VEF/USD exchange rate in the Swap
Market was consistently higher than the Official Exchange Rate imposed by the
BCV”?

B. The 2009 Measures regarding the export of gold

The 1996 BCV Resolution, which had created a liberal gold export regime,
continued in force until April 2009, when the BCV decided to repeal it and to enact
Resolution No. 09-04-03 [the “April 2009 BCV Resolution’]”°.

The April 2009 BCV Resolution significantly altered the legal regime for the export
of gold, by providing that 60% of the quarterly production had to be sold to the
BCV. The BCV would pay the price in VEF by converting the international price
of gold, denominated in USD, at the Official Exchange Rate (which was
consistently lower than the market rate prevailing in the Swap Market).

Another 10% of the quarterly production could be freely sold to the domestic
processing sector.

The April 2009 BCV Resolution permitted the export of up to 30% of production
subject to BCV authorization, but any gold for which permission to export was
denied, had to be sold in its entirety to the BCV™.

In June 2009 Venezuela adopted two additional resolutions:
- Resolution BCV No. 09-06-03 [the “June 2009 BCV Resolution” ]’> and
- Convenio Cambiario No. 12 [the “Convenio Cambiario No. 12”]"°.

The June 2009 BCV Resolution reaffirmed the April 2009 BCV Resolution, but
only for privately owned gold producing companies: it reiterated the rule that such
companies had to sell 70% of their gold production in the domestic market — 60%
to the BCV and 10% to private buyers; only up to 30% of the production could be
exported, subject to discretionary authorization by the BCV; absent such
authorization, this percentage had to be sold to the BCV.

 

The June 2009 BCV Resolution, however, offered a more relaxed regime for state-
owned gold producers (e.g. those where the Republic or its agencies hold more than
50% of the capital); in such companies the percentage earmarked for the domestic
market was reduced from 70% to 50%, 25% to be offered to the BCV and the
remaining 25% to private domestic buyers. The other 50% could be exported”’.

The Convenio Cambiario No. 12 introduced a further differentiation between
private companies and state-owned gold producing companies. While the former
were now obliged to repatriate all foreign currency from gold exports and sell it to
the BCV at the Official Exchange Rate, state-owned companies were exempted
from that rule and allowed to maintain foreign currency in bank accounts located
abroad, and to freely use such funds to make payments in foreign currency”®.

 
 

The April 2009 BCV Resolution, the June 2009 BCV Resolution and the Convenio
Cambiario No. 12 [together, the “2009 Measures”] left Rusoro’s subsidiaries at a
disadvantage: while State-owned companies could sell their gold to the (domestic
and export) market enjoying nearly complete freedom, Rusoro’s subsidiaries were
compelled to sell 90% of their gold to the BCV or to export it, subject to BCV’s
authorization and to repatriate the funds at the (lower) Official Exchange Rate.

. The 2009 Measures had a significant impact on the business model of private

Venezuelan gold producers. The impact was such that two months after adoption
of the June 2009 BCV Resolution, Minister Sanz himself wrote to the President of
the BCV, suggesting a modification to Art. 2 of the June 2009 BCV Resolution.
Minister Sanz’s proposal was that domestic and export sales requirements

established should apply uniformly to private and state-owned companies”.
However, no immediate action was adopted by the BCV — in fact the rules were not
changed until July 2010. Before that, the exchange control regime was made even
more stringent, and the Swap Market was closed.

C. Elimination of the Swap Market

On 17 May 2010 the Asamblea Nacional of Venezuela passed the “Ley de Reforma
Parcial de la Ley contra Ilicitos Cambiarios” [“Ley de Reforma Cambiaria”],
making the use of the Swap Market for the obtaining of foreign currency illegal®°.
The sale and purchase of foreign currency became the exclusive purview of the
BCV, through CADIVI, and the penalty for circumventing this law was a fine of
twice the amount of the transaction, and possible imprisonment.

In June 2010 the Government of Venezuela created the Sistema de Transacciones
con Titulos en Moneda Extranjera [(“SITME”]*!, a system which allowed
individuals or companies meeting certain requirements to access foreign currency
at a preferential exchange rate, but subject to a limit of USD 350.000 per month.
SITME simulated the operation of the extinct Swap Market, because it allowed
companies to buy USD denominated government bonds in VEF at the Official
Exchange Rate and to resell these bonds abroad for USD, at a market discount.

D. The 2010 Measures regarding the export of gold

A month and a half later, in July and early August of 2010, the BCV passed two
new rules, which amended the existing regulations and reduced the discrimination
between publicly and privately owned gold producers.

The first rule was Resolution BCV No. 10-07-01 [the “July 2010 BCV
Resolution” ]* which gave some breathing space to the private gold industry: the
mandatory requirement that private gold producers sell a portion of their production
in the domestic market was reduced from 70 to 50%. However, the rule was now
that the totality of these domestic sales had to be made to the BCV, at a price
expressed in VEF and converted at the Official Exchange Rate (the 10% allowance
for the private domestic gold market was scrapped). The remaining 50% could be
exported, subject to authorization from the BCV, but would have to be sold to the
BCV if such authorization was denied.

 
  

The July 2010 BCV Resolution did not imply any change for publicly owned gold
companies: the mandatory requirements remained in place (50% for the domestic
market, of which 25% was to be sold to the BCV and 25% to private buyers, and
the remaining 50% available for export).

Simultaneously the Convenio Cambiario No. 12 was amended [“Amendment to
Convenio Cambiario No. 12”], partially liberalizing the exchange control regime

of gold producers, and unifying the different regimes applicable to private and to
public gold producers. All gold producers were now required to sell 50% of their
foreign currency income from export operations to the BCV at the Official
Exchange Rate, and were authorized to keep the other 50% in foreign accounts and
to use the funds for payments in foreign currency outside the Bolivarian Republic®.

THE NATIONALIZATION DECREE

On 17 August 2011 (one year after the publication in the Gaceta Oficial of the July
2010 BCV Resolution and the Amendment to Convenio Cambiario No. 12),
President Chavez publicly announced the immediate nationalization of the gold
mining industry in Venezuela, with the stated purpose of combating illegal
mining*. President Chavez was quoted in the press saying that in the next few days
the Bolivarian Republic would adopt “a decree to take the gold sector”, which still
remains in the hands of a “mafia and smugglers”®>.

  

On 16 September 2011 Venezuela adopted Supreme Decree No. 8.413 [the
“Nationalization Decree”]*°. The Nationalization Decree, which had “rango, valor
y fuerza de Ley Organica” introduced a new legal framework for gold mining in
Venezuela and reserved the gold extraction and exploitation activities to the State.
The Nationalization Decree defined its purpose with the following words:

“[...] con el propésito de revertir los graves efectos del modelo minero
capitalista, caracterizado por la degradacién del ambiente, el irrespeto de la
ordenaci6n territorial, el atentado a la dignidad y la salud de las mineras
mineros y pobladoras pobladores de las comunidades aledafias a las dreas
mineras, a través de la auténtica vinculacién de la actividad de explotacién del
oro con la ejecucién de politicas ptiblicas que se traduzcan en el vivir bien del
pueblo, la proteccién ambiental y el desarrollo nacional”.

To achieve this purpose all assets and operations associated with the mining and
exploitation of gold in Venezuela were considered to be of “public utility and social
interest”. The Nationalization Decree provided for State control of the property and
mining rights of all gold producing companies. All the activities related to the
mining of gold could only be performed either by:

- The State or companies wholly owned by the State or its affiliates; or by

- Joint public-private companies, in respect of which the State held an equity
participation of 55% or more, and exercised control over corporate decisions
[Mixed Companies” ].

. According to the Nationalization Decree, all gold was to be sold to the State*’ and

any concessions or contracts granted prior to the Nationalization Decree were to be
transferred to Mixed Companies**.

The Decree further provided for negotiations between companies holding mining
rights and the Government for a period of 90 days from the date of its publication,
in order to facilitate the migration to Mixed Companies. Failure to agree within the
90-days period of negotiations would lead to an automatic extinction of the
concessions and contracts granted prior to the Nationalization Decree*’. Once time
was up, the competent Ministry would assume control over these assets and
operations”.

The Nationalization Decree further established that investors be compensated with
an amount equal to the book value of the investment, provided that the investment
had been duly registered with the competent authority?!

THE FIRST NEGOTIATION PERIOD

Soon after the implementation of the Nationalization Decree, on 7 October 2011,
MIBAM issued Resolutions No. 88/2011 [“Resolution 88”]” and No. 89/2011
[“Resolution 89”]°? which governed the procedures to be applied for the
nationalization of the gold industry and the taking of control by the Bolivarian
Republic:

- Resolution 88 created a single negotiation commission [the “Negotiation
Commission”] for the whole gold industry, with the task of transferring all
gold concessions, contracts and leases to new Mixed Companies, controlled
by the Republic and including participation of the investors; the mandate
granted to the Negotiation Commission would expire 90 days after
publication of the Nationalization Decree in the Gaceta Oficial (i.e. the
mandate expired on 15 December 2011);

 

- Resolution 89 established an Operational Transition Committee [“OTC”]
entrusted with the authority of taking control over and managing all gold
assets to be nationalized; OTC’s mandate was also scheduled to last for a
period of 90 days, until 15 December 2011, but could be extended by the
Minister.

While the negotiations with the investors were developing, the Government decide
to implement a new exchange control regulation, Convenio Cambiario No. 19°,
authorizing privately controlled gold producers to purchase foreign currency from
the BCV at the Official Exchange Rate, if required for regular payments owed to

of a certificate issued by the OTC, confirming the regularity of the transaction and
the existence of the debt.

 

Negotiations between Rusoro and the Negotiation Commission started in
September 2011 and continued through December, but the 90-day period expired
without an agreement regarding compensation having been reached. On 15
December 2011, the last day of the negotiation period, Rusoro sent a letter notifying
Venezuela” of the existence of a dispute under the BIT.

THE SECO!

 

IEGOTIA TION PERIOD

Without prior communication or consultation, on 15 December 2011, the last day
of negotiations, Venezuela adopted Decree No. 8.683 [the “Amendment
Decree”]®, extending the deadline for reaching an agreement by another 90 days.
During this extension, the meetings between the Negotiation Commission and
Rusoro continued, but it proved impossible to find a settlement. On 17 February
2012 Rusoro wrote to the Government drawing attention to its economic
difficulties, exacerbated by the extension of the negotiation period”.

On 13 March 2012 a final meeting between Rusoro and PDVSA (a State-owned oil
company that was undertaking a due diligence on Rusoro’s subsidiaries on behalf
of the State) took place. It became clear that no agreement on compensation could
be reached, and negotiations were suspended. On the next day, 14 March 2012, the
negotiation period expired with no agreement between Rusoro and the Government
having been reached.

Accordingly, all Mining Rights held by Rusoro through its subsidiaries were
automatically extinguished by law as of 15 March 2012°8.

On the same date, the Vice-Minister of Mines informed Rusoro’s negotiating team
that the Government would take control of all assets and operations on 19 March
2012. To facilitate the take-over process, Rusoro was instructed to prepare a draft
document of transfer; this was done and submitted to the Vice-Minister of Mines
on 18 March 2012”.

3. On 26 March 2012 Rusoro requested the Government to provide an urgent schedule

outlining how the transfer of operations and assets to the Republic would be
performed?!®°, Rusoro added that if the schedule was not received by 28 March 2012,
it would cease operations by 31 March 2012. In the face of no formal response from
the Government, on 31 March 2012 Rusoro formally withdrew from the mining
areas.

THE TAKING OF CONTROL OF RUSORO’S ETS

 

All of Rusoro’s Mining Rights and other assets were taken over by the Bolivarian
Republic immediately after Rusoro’s withdrawal. The taking was under the total
control of the Government, since no representatives of Rusoro were present. The
only written evidence is the “Acta de Toma de Posesién” of Choco 4 and Choco 10
mining areas, recording the transfer of these mines to the Republic, which was
signed on 2 April 2012 !°!. Another document in the record is a letter dated 10 April
2012, sent by the Vice-Minister of Mines to Rusoro, requesting a meeting to execute
a document for transfer for Bloque B!™.

 

Eight months later, on 28 December 2012, the MPM issued Resolution No. 177,
transferring a newly created mining area in Bolivar State to PDVSA [“PDVSA
Mining Blocks”]!°°. This new mining area included the following deposits:

- Bloque El Callao-Guasipati: this deposit includes the producing Choco 10
mine, Choco 4 and the neighbouring Increible 6 deposits, formerly controlled
by Rusoro!™;

- Bloque El Callao: which includes the Isidora mine, also formerly controlled
by Rusoro!%,

- Bloque Sifontes Sur.

The PDVSA Mining Blocks contain 81.4 million ounces of gold!°°. Rusoro alleges
that Rusoro’s properties of Choco 10, Choco 4, Increible 6 and Isidora count for
approximately one ninth of these mineral resources (i.e. 10.175 million ounces)!0”.

By the end of 2013 PDVSA established the Empresa Nacional Aurifera [“ENA”] a
gold mining subsidiary which holds the rights over the 81.4 million ounces in the
PDVSA Mining Blocks, plus a further 10.6 million ounces from other unspecified
sites!

 

In 2013 PDVSA sold to the BCV a 40% shareholding in ENA for USD 9.524
billion'™.

THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS IN BRIEF
Claimant

Rusoro claims that Venezuela violated six of its obligations under the Canada-
Venezuela BIT. In particular, the Claimant avers that Venezuela expropriated the
Claimant’s investment without payment of compensation. It further considers that
Respondent:

- Failed to accord Claimant’s investments fair and equitable treatment;
- Failed to accord Claimant’s investments full protection and security;

- Failed to accord Claimant treatment no less favourable than the treatment it
grants to its own investors;

- Failed to guarantee to Claimant the unrestricted transfer of its investments
and returns;

- Imposed restrictions on the exportation of gold, in contravention of the BIT.

Hence, Rusoro requests the Tribunal to order Venezuela to pay a compensation in
the amount of USD 2,318,898,825!!°, net of Venezuelan taxes, plus pre- and post-
award interest at Venezuela’s sovereign borrowing rate, compounded annually,
until payment is made in full.

 

Claimant further demands that the Tribunal dismisses Respondent’s counter-claim.
Finally, it requests that Venezuela be ordered to pay all the costs and expenses
relating to the present arbitration.

Respondent

First and foremost, Respondent asks the Tribunal to declare its lack of jurisdiction
to hear Rusoro’s claims and to order Claimant to pay all costs associated with the
arbitration since the date of the Tribunal’s refusal to bifurcate the proceedings, with
interests.

 

3. Should the Tribunal find that it has jurisdiction to decide on the present case,

Respondent requests the dismissal of all of Claimant’s claims on the merits.

Should the Tribunal find that Venezuela is by any means responsible, Respondent
asks the Tribunal to declare that Rusoro failed to prove the quantum of its damages
and that therefore Venezuela is not required to pay any compensation. Should the
Tribunal award damages to Claimant, Respondent asks these be limited to the
amount of USD 1,555,308!!!.

Sl

185. Additionally, if the Tribunal holds that it has jurisdiction to hear this dispute,
Respondent asserts a counter-claim for Claimant’s improper mining practices
which caused damage to Venezuela’s natural resources.

2. | CLAIMANT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF IN FULL

186. Inits Post Hearing Brief, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal grant the following
relief! !?:

“219. [...]

(a)DISMISS all Venezuela’s objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal;

(b)DECLARE that Venezuela violated Article VII(1) of the Treaty by
expropriating the Claimant’s investment without payment of compensation;

(c)DECLARE that Venezuela violated Article II(2) of the Treaty by failing to
accord the Claimant’s investments fair and equitable treatment;

(d)DECLARE that Venezuela violated Article II(2) of the Treaty by failing to
accord the Claimant’s investments full protection and security; and

(e)DECLARE that Venezuela violated Article IV of the Treaty by failing to
accord the Claimant treatment no less favorable than the treatment it grants
to its own investors;

(f) DECLARE that Venezuela violated Article VIII of the Treaty by failing to
guarantee to the Claimant the unrestricted transfer of its investments and
returns; and

(g)DECLARE that Venezuela violated paragraph 6 of the Annex to the Treaty
by imposing restrictions on the exportation of gold.

(h)DISMISS Venezuela’s Counter-claim;

(i) ORDER Venezuela to pay compensation to the Claimant of no less than US
$2,318,898,825 and, to the extent applicable, DECLARE that the sum
awarded has been calculated net of Venezuelan taxes;

(j) ORDER Venezuela to pay pre- and post-award interest at Venezuela’s
sovereign borrowing rate (as updated), compounded annually, accruing until
payment is made in full or such other rate as the Tribunal deems
appropriate;

(k)ORDER Venezuela to indemnify the Claimant in full with respect to any
Venezuelan taxes imposed on the compensation awarded to the extent that
such compensation has been calculated net of Venezuelan taxes;

(J) ORDER Venezuela to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration,
including the Claimant’s reasonable legal and expert fees, and the fees and
expenses of the Tribunal; and

(m)AWARD such other relief to the Claimant as the Tribunal considers
appropriate.

220. To the extent this Tribunal finds that Venezuela’s Measures constituted a
creeping expropriation in violation of Article VII of the Treaty (paragraph 219(b)
above) and that the compensation to be awarded to Rusoro includes the effects of
each of those measures calculated by reference to Fair Market Value, Rusoro would
be content for the Tribunal to make those findings without proceeding to consider
the additional violations of the Treaty (paragraph 219 (c)-(g) above)”.

3. THE RESPONDENT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF

187. In its Post Hearing Brief, the Respondent asks that the Tribunal issue the following
Award!!3;

“[...] stating it lacks jurisdiction to hear Rusoro’s claims under the Treaty and
the Additional Facility, and order Rusoro to pay all the fees, expenses, and
costs associated with defending against these proceedings since the date of its
opposition to Venezuela’s request for bifurcation (15 May 2013), with
interest;

e Should the Tribunal find that it has jurisdiction to hear Rusoro’s dispute,
o only consider claims for compensation for alleged breaches and harm
after 17 July 2009,
o issue an Award dismissing all of Rusoro’s claims in their entirety for
lack of factual and legal merit, and
find that Venezuela is entitled to compensation for injury suffered based
on the counter-claim specified in Part IV;

  

°

Should the Tribunal find Venezuela has breached any provision of the Treaty
or is otherwise legally responsible,

o issue an Award indicating that Rusoro has failed to meet its burden to
prove the quantum of its damages and finding that Venezuela is not
required to pay Rusoro any compensation;

e Should the Tribunal award damages,

o find that damages are limited to compensation for alleged reserves based
on DCF values included in the final column of Table 6 of the Experts’
Joint Matrix;
reduce damages by at least 50% for contributory fault; and
for any liability based on venire contra factum proprium, confianza
legitima, or estoppel, limit damages to injury caused by detrimental
reliance; and

VI. JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS

188. Venezuela argues that Rusoro bears the burden of proving the facts and
requirements necessary to establish jurisdiction and that it has failed to do so for
three reasons!!*:

- First, because Rusoro’s dispute is time-barred under Art. XII.3(d) of the
Treaty [VI.1.],

- Second, because there is no jurisdiction before the ICSID Additional Facility
[VI.2.], and

- Third, because Rusoro did not own or control the assets upon which it bases
its claims in accordance with Venezuelan law [VI.3.].

189. Claimant submits that each of these three jurisdictional objections is meritless!!5.

VL1. THE FIRST JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTION: THE
DISPUTE IS TIME-BARRED

 

190. Art. XII.1 of the Treaty!!® provides as follows:

“ARTICLE XII — Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the
Host Contracting Party

1. Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or
not taken by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this A ent, and
that the investor or an enterprise owned or controlled directly or indirectly by
i r damage by reason of, or arising out of, that
settled amicably between them”.

 

  

191. Art. XII.3 adds:

“ARTICLE XII — Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the
Host Contracting Party

3. An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to
arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) [ICSID Convention Arbitration
or ICSID Additional Facility Rules Arbitration] only if:

197.

. Venezuela avers that Rusoro iden

(d) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor
first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach
and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage”.

Both Parties agree that the relevant date for triggering the time bar is three years
before Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration, i.e. 17 July 2009 [the “Cut-Off
Date”]!”.

RESPONDENT’S POSITION

  

fied in its Request for Arbitration several
measures adopted by Venezuela “starting in 2009” which amounted to a breach of
the Treaty: these included the so-called 2009 Measures, (i.e. the April and June
2009 BCV Resolutions and the Convenio Cambiario No. 12). In a letter dated 3
July 2009, Rusoro explained to the Venezuelan authorities that the 2009 Measures
were having a severe impact on its operations!'’,

Venezuela says that Rusoro’s basic claim is that the 2009 Measures breach the
expropriation provision of Art. VII of the Treaty. Rusoro consequently includes the
resulting losses in its claim for compensation and seeks lost cash flows from June
2009 onwards. In Respondent’s opinion, these claims are time-barred under Art.
XII.3 (d), because Rusoro knew about the alleged breach and resulting harm before
the Cut-Off Date!!®.

 

Venezuela adds that Rusoro’s final effort to avoid the time bar, namely the
argument that the 2009 Measures were components of a composite breach that
crystallized within the three-year period, also lacks merit!?°. Rusoro knew of the
2009 Measures and their effects as proven by the 3 July 2009 letter, so that even if
the Measures were considered part of a composite act, the date of breach would still
be outside the three-year limit!?!.

In Venezuela’s opinion, the time limit in the Treaty applies to the entire dispute, not
to individual claims: an investor may not submit a dispute to arbitration if more
than three years have elapsed since the investor acquired knowledge of a breach
giving rise to a dispute and resulting in the occurrence of damage!”’. This derives
from the wording of Art. XII.3 (d) of the Treaty, which uses the expression
“dispute” — not “claim” like Art. 1116(2) NAFTA!>.

 

Alternatively, if the Tribunal were to disregard the use of the word “dispute” in the
Treaty and equate the time bar provision to the “claim” formulation of NAFTA — a
position with which the Respondent disagrees — there can be no compensation for
damage caused by the 2003 foreign exchange regime or the 2009 Measures. If the
Tribunal allows any claims to proceed, compensation based on alleged breaches

before the Cut-Off Date must be excluded. This is the solution adopted by the
Tribunal in Bilcon'*.

CLAIMANT’S POSITION
Rusoro avers that its claims are not time-barred.

Rusoro is submitting only breaches committed by Venezuela that occurred within
the three-year limitation period. Rusoro does not allege that any of the measures
adopted before the Cut-Off Date, standing alone, breached the Treaty. All of the
breaches resulted either from a series of measures that began before the Cut-Off
Date, but continued afterwards, or from measures that occurred after the Cut-Off
Date. In each instance the breach occurred, or the composite crystallized, within the
three-year limitation period!”>.

The Treaty does not provide — unlike some other treaties — that the limitation period
commences when the investor learns of facts which may later constitute part of an
alleged breach. The Treaty requires the investor’s actual or constructive knowledge
of a breach and resulting damage!*®. The mere possibility that a loss may occur
cannot trigger the limitation period'?’, The 3 July 2009 letter sent by Rusoro
regarding the June 2009 BCV Resolution does not suggest that Rusoro was aware
of the nature or extent of the losses that would result from Venezuela’s actions. It
records Rusoro’s concern — not that Rusoro had already recognized a loss under the
Treaty for which Venezuela was liable!?8.

In composite acts, the Commentary to the 2001 ILC Articles on State Responsibility
contradicts Venezuela’s position: when enough of the series of acts have occurred
to constitute a wrongful act, the act is regarded as having occurred over the whole
period from the commission of the first act in the series to the last!?°. There is no
inconsistency between claiming breach of an international obligation by a
composite act and seeking damages for the loss sed by each element of such
breach. Rusoro is entitled to compensation for los caused by all actions and
omissions comprising the composite act, including measures adopted before the
Cut-Off Date, which form part of the composite act!*?.

 
    

Claimant also disagrees with Venezuela’s contention that if any of Rusoro’s claims
is time-barred, the entire dispute must be dismissed. Venezuela’s submission is

 

arises out of a claim by an investor that a measure breached the Treaty. If a party
submits multiple claims, the limitation period can only apply to those individual
ims where the breach and the loss occurred more than three years before the
ssion of the request!*!,

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

 

. Art. XIL1 of the Treaty (which has been reproduced at the beginning of this section)

regulates the settlement of disputes between investors and host states. In its first
paragraph, it defines the scope of the disputes which can be settled by arbitration:
arbitrable disputes are those

“relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken [by a
Contracting Party] is in breach of this Agreement and that the investor [...]
has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of that breach”.

Thus a dispute is arbitrable if an investor protected by the Treaty submits (one or
more) claims alleging that (i) a measure taken or omitted by a State, (ii) is in breach
of the Treaty and (iii) has caused damage to the investor.

  

Paragraph 3 (d) of the same Article then creates a statute of limitations applicable
to arbitrable disputes. An investor may only submit a dispute involving (one or
more) claims for breach of the Treaty to arbitration, if

“no more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor
first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach
and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage”.

Application of the time bar thus requires that more than three years have elapsed
between

- the date when the investor for the first time obtained actual or constructive
knowledge (i) of a breach of the Treaty and (ii) of a loss or damage caused by
such breach and suffered by the investor, and

- the date of submission to arbitration of the dispute which involves claims for
that breach of the Treaty.

The Tribunal notes the similarities between Art. XII.3 (d) of the Treaty and NAFTA
Art. 1116(2), which reads:

 

“An investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from
the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired,
knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred
loss or damage”.

The similarity of the wording of the provisions of the BIT applicable in the present
case with that of the rules governing NAFTA arbitrations recalls the case law
developed in the context of such arbitrations. The Tribunal is mindful in this respect
that NAFTA jurisprudence is not at one in answering the question of how time
concerning continuing and composite acts should be computed.

 

  

In point of fact, while some tribunals have excluded events prior to the critical date
and their relationship with other measures that followed — as was the case in Grand

s7

209.

210.

211.

River, Feldman'* and Mondev'™, and more recently in Bilcon'> — other
tribunals have opted for the opposite conclusion — as UPS'** did — or did not need
to determine the matter in the light of the facts of the case — as in Merrill & Ring'*’.

In certain situations, the view that time concerning limitation should be extended
so as to begin at the moment the act ceases to exist has been supported, but with the
limit that it should not result in a continued extension of the limitations period as
this might end affecting the necessary certainty and legal stability. Otherwise claims
might be introduced years after the first events took place. It is of course necessary
to avoid a consequence that the rule was precisely meant to prevent.

Cut-Off Date

The Parties agree that the date which triggers the time bar is three years before
Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration. Since the Request was filed on 17 July
2012, the Cut-Off Date is 17 July 2009!38.

The discussion centres on whether the breaches allegedly committed by Venezuela,
and which give rise to the claims submitted in this arbitration, predate or not the
Cut-Off Date and whether their existence and effects were known (or should have
been known) to Rusoro. To answer this question, the Tribunal must identify the
dates when the alleged breaches to the Treaty occurred (A.). Thereafter the Tribunal
will be able to assess when the investor first obtained actual or constructive
knowledge of such breaches, and of the loss or damage caused thereby (B.), and
decide on the application of the time bar to the three claims submitted by Rusoro
(direct expropriation, creeping expropriation and ancillary claims) (C.); finally the
Tribunal will address Venezuela’s argument that application of the time bar should
lead to the dismissal of the whole dispute (D.).

 

  

A. Dates of Venezuela’s alleged breaches

The Claimant in its Memorial identifies the following acts of Venezuela which gave
rise to breaches of the Treaty:

- The April 2009 BCV Resolution, dated 30 April 2009";
- The June 2009 BCV Resolution, dated 11 June 2009!4°;

- Convenio Cambiario No. 12, dated 11 June 2009'*!; (these three acts are
collectively referred to as the 2009 Measures);

- Ley de Reforma Cambiaria, dated 13 May 2010, which closed the Swap

- The July 2010 BCV Resolution, dated 15 July 2010!43

- The Amendment to the Convenio Cambiario No. 12, on 11 August 2010!4*
(these last two acts are collectively referred to as the 2010 Measures);

- The Nationalization Decree (Decree No. 8.413), dated 23 August 2011!45;
- MIBAM Resolutions 88 and 89, dated 7 October 2011!4°;

- Convenio Cambiario No. 19, dated 17 October 2011!47;

- Decree No. 8.683 dated 8 December 201 1!*8;

- Resolution No 177 of the Ministry of People’s Power for Petroleum and
Mining, dated 28 December 2012'*9.

212. Of all these measures adopted by Venezuela, the only ones which could be affected
by the time bar are the 2009 Measures, because these are the only ones that predate
the Cut-Off Date.

B. Claimant’s knowledge of the 2009 Measures

213. The relevant date for time bar purposes is when Claimant obtained actual or
constructive knowledge of the adoption of the 2009 Measures and of their
consequences for Rusoro’s investment. It is undisputed that the 2009 Measures
were published in the Gaceta Oficial of the Bolivarian Republic before the Cut-Off
Date; thus by that date the Claimant was aware, or should have been aware, of the
enactment of the 2009 Measures.

214. However, Art. XII.3 (d) requires, for the time bar to apply, not only that the investor
knows about the alleged breach, but also that the investor is aware that such breach
would cause loss or damage to its investment.

215. Did this happen before the Cut-Off Date?

Republic!™°. In this letter, Claimant complains about the June 2009 BCV Resolution
and the Convenio Cambiario No. 12, and states that these measures establish

“[...] new rules for the sale of gold which harm our gold production
companies alone”.

In accordance with established NAFTA case law, what is required is simple
knowledge that loss or damage has been caused, even if the extent and
quantification are still unclear!>!. The letter proves beyond any reasonable doubt
that as of end of June 2009, and before the occurrence of the Cut-Off Date, Claimant
was aware that 2009 Measures could cause loss or damage to its investment.

Claimant thus had knowledge, before the Cut-Off Date, that the 2009 Measures had
been adopted, that they might imply a breach of the Treaty and cause damage to the
investment.

C. Implication of the time bar for Rusoro’s claims

The Tribunal will next review the various claims submitted by Rusoro, and analyse
whether any of these claims can be affected by the time bar. Rusoro is submitting
claims for direct expropriation (a.), for creeping expropriations (b.) and for certain
“Ancillary Claims” (c.):

a. Direct expropriation

Rusoro’s first claim is for direct expropriation of its investment in violation of Art.
VII of the Treaty. This expropriation was allegedly accomplished by the
Nationalization Decree, which postdates the Cut-Off Date and consequently is
unaffected by any time bar issue!*?.

b. Creeping expropriation

Rusoro’s second claim is for creeping expropriation:
Venezuela allegedly enacted a series of interconnected measures targeting Rusoro’s
gold mining business and culminating in the outright nationalization of Rusoro’s
investment through the Nationalization Decree. Claimant submits that taken
together Venezuela’s chain of actions resulted in the expropriation of Rusoro’s
investment!>? and that this creeping expropriation implied a composite breach of
the Treaty. All events pre-dating the Cut-Off Date, including the 2009 Measures,
are at most part of a composite breach that crystallized after the time bar became
applicable!™4,

 

  

Respondent disagrees. In its opinion, a composite act should be regarded as having
occurred as of the first action or omi:! n committed by the State. In this case, the
total claim for creeping expropriation should be excluded as a consequence of the

application of the time bar, because the first action occurred before the Cut-Off
Date!.

ILC Articles

. Both parties rely on the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally

Wrongful Acts [“ILC Articles”]'*°. Art. 15 provides the following criteria for
composite acts:

“Article 15. Breach consisting of a composite act

1. The breach of an international obligation by a State through a series of
actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful occurs when the action
or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is
sufficient to constitute the wrongful act.

2. In such a case, the breach extends over the entire period starting with the
first of the actions or omissions of the series and lasts for as long as these
tions or omissions are repeated and remain not in conformity with the
international obligation.”

 

 

    

Art. 15.1 defines the moment when the composite act is deemed to occur and
Art. 15.2 the date and extension in time of the breach. The composite act is deemed
to occur when the action or omission happens which, taken together with the

actions or omissions, sufficient to constitute the wrongful act. And the
starts with the date of the first act of the series of the composite act, and
extends over the entire period.

  
 

 

           
 

The Commentary to the ILC Articles contains the following explanation:
“Article 15. Breach consisting of a composite act
Commentary
(8) Paragraph | of article 15 defines the time at which a composite act
“occurs” as the time at which the last action or omission occurs which, taken

with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act,
without it necessarily having to be the last in the series.

 
 

 

L.]

 

(10) Paragraph 2 of article 15 deals with the extension in time of a composite
act. Once a sufficient number of actions or omissions has occurred, producing
the result of the composite act as such, the breach is dated to the first of the
acts in the series. The status of the first action or omission is equivocal until
enough of the series has occurred to constitute the wrongful act; but at that
point, the act should be regarded as having occurred over the whole period
from the commission of the first action or omission. If this were not so, the
effectiveness of the prohibition would thereby be undermined.”

232.

The drafters of the Commentary reiterate that the purpose of Art. 15.1 is to set a
criterion to determine the occurrence of a composite act (i.e., when the last action
has occurred, which taken with the previous ones is sufficient for the breach to have
occurred); while Art. 15.2 determines the relevant date of the breach (i.e., the date
of the first of the acts in the series).

 

Although the general thrust of the ILC Articles regarding composite acts is clear,
the Articles do not address every single question, and in particular do not solve how
time bar affects a string of acts which gives rise to a composite breach of a treaty.

The Tribunal’s appro:
There are two possible approaches for solving this question.

(i) A first approach would be to consider that a connection exists between the acts
performed before the Cut-Off Date (the 2009 Measures) and those which occurred
thereafter (the 2010 Measures and the Nationalization Decree). If such linkage is
found the continuing character of the acts and the composite nature of the breach
may justify that the totality of acts be considered as a unity not affected by the time
bar. Certain investment tribunals have found that the linkage existed and
disregarded the time-bar defence!5’.

 

This approach, although legally sound, is very fact specific and depends on the
circumstances of the case. In the present dispute, there is no clear linkage between
the 2009 Measures, the 2010 Measures and the Nationalization Decree. The 2009
Measures imposed strict limitations on the export of gold, increased the exchange
control requirements for gold exporters and created two distinct regimes, one for
privately owned, and the other for Government owned gold companies. The 2010
Measures went in the opposite direction: export limitations were reduced, the
regime was unified and the general exchange control system was overhauled. The
Nationalization Decree took a totally different stance: it ordered the nationalization
of the whole gold sector.

 
  

(ii) For this reason, the Tribunal finds that, in the specific circumstances of this
case, the better approach for applying the time bar consists in breaking down each
alleged composite claim into individual breaches, each referring to a certain
governmental measure, and to apply the time bar to each of such breaches
separately. This approach is the one adopted by other investment tribunals!** and
respects the wording of Art. XII.3 (d), which defines the starting date for the time
bar period as the date when the investor acquired knowledge that a breach had
occurred and a loss had been suffered.

The result is that breaches allegedly committed by Venezuela through the adoption
of the 2009 Measures have become time barred, cannot result in enforceable claims

‘ST UPS at 28.

158 See e.g Bilcon at 266 where “the Tribunal finds it possible and appropriate, as did the tribunals in
Feldman, Mondev and Grand River, to separate a series of events into distinct components, some time-
barred, some still eligible for consideration on the merits”.

62

233. Another precision is relevant: while Art. XII.3 (d) of the Treaty bars

and cannot be taken into consideration to decide whether a creeping expropriation
has occurred (while claims relating to later breaches are not affected).

claims
concerning alleged breaches which occurred before the Cut-Off Date, this does not
imply that the measures underlying such breaches become irrelevant. They provide
the necessary background and context for adjudicating the case, and the legitimate
expectations of an investor may depend crucially on matters that occurred before
such Cut-Off Date!*?.

  

ec. Ancillary Claims

234. Rusoro has also filed several ancillary claims [the “Ancillary Claims”):

- that Venezuela failed to accord Rusoro’s investment Fair and Equitable
Treatment [“FET”]!©

- and Full Protection and Security [“FPS”]!°',
162

- that Venezuela discriminated against Rusoro and its investments'

- that Venezuela impeded the free transfer of funds related to Rusoro’s
investments!®,

- and that Venezuela imposed an illegal export ban on gold!**.

235. Claimant alleges that the 2009 Measures form part of the breaches which resulted

in the Ancillary Claims.

236. The Tribunal has already found that any alleged breach committed by Venezuela

and based solely on the 2009 Measures is time-barred!©>. This principle also applies
to the Ancillary Claims. To the extent that the Ancillary Claims concern breaches
of the Treaty supported by measures having occurred after the Cut-Off Date, such
claims are enforceable and are not affected by Art. XII.3 (d). The 2009 Measures
may however have some relevance as background and context and to establish the
legitimate expectations of the investor.

D. Dismissal of the whole dispute?

237. Venezuela submits a final argument: in its opinion, if any of Rusoro’s claims is

time-barred, the entire dispute must be dismissed'®™.

238. The Tribunal disagrees.

241.

242.

Venezuela’s argument is contrary to the plain reading of Art. XII of the Treaty. Art.
XII does not forbid that an arbitrable dispute include multiple claims. If a party
submits multiple claims to a single arbitration, the time bar established in Art. XII.3
(d) can only apply to those individual claims where knowledge (actual or construed)
of the breach and the resulting loss had occurred before the time bar kicked in. The
remaining claims cannot be affected. To hold the contrary leads to untenable
consequences: a claim which is not time barred cannot become unenforceable
because in the same arbitration a separate claim is deemed affected by the time bar.

Applying this principle to our case, the fact that any claim based on the 2009
Measures may be declared time-barred, cannot lead to the consequence that
Rusoro’s other claims, based on other alleged breaches committed by the Republic,
automatically also become unenforceable by application of Art. XII.3 (d) of the
Treaty.

VIL.2. THE SECOND JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTION: NO
JURISDICTION BEFORE THE ICSID ADDITIONAL
FACILITY

 

Art. XII.4 of the Treaty offers investors a triple choice of venues for submitting a
dispute to arbitration:

- First, the investor can select the ICSID Convention, “provided that the
disputing Contracting Party and the Contracting Party of the investor are
parties to the ICSID Convention”;

- Second, the investor can choose the ICSID AF Rules, “provided that either
the disputing Contracting Party or the Contracting Party of the investor, but
not both, is a party to the ICSID Convention”;

 

- Third, “in case neither of the procedures mentioned above is available”, the
investor can finally submit the dispute to UNCITRAL arbitration.

It is undisputed that at the relevant time Canada was not a party to the ICSID
Convention, so that the investor had no access to the first alternative. It is also
undisputed that the Bolivarian Republic, which historically had been a party to the
ICSID Convention, denounced the Convention on 24 January 2012, and that such
denunciation took effect as of 25 July 2012.

3. On 17 July 2012, i.e. before the denunciation took effect, Rusoro submitted its

Request for Arbitration, including its application for approval for the AF Rules [the
“Date of Request”]. On 1 August 2012. i.e. once the denunciation had become
effective, ICSID gave its approval and registered the dispute [the “Date of
Registration’ ]'’.

244.

245.

246.

247.

248.

249.

 

The Bolivarian Republic submits that in a case brought under the AF Rules, either
the State Party to the arbitration, or the State of nationality of the investor must be
an ICSID Contracting State. If neither State is a Contracting State, the arbitration
cannot proceed in this forum!®’. There are two moments at which this requirement
has to be met:

 

 

- first, when the Secretary-General approves the agreement to access the AF

Rules and

  

- second, when she registers the request for arbitration and thereby institutes
proceedings.

In the present case, at both of these moments, neither Canada nor Venezuela were
5169,

Contracting States
Art. 4(2) of the AF Rules regulates the approval by the Secretary General and only
permits the Secretary General to give her approval if she is satisfied that the
requirements are fulfilled “at the time” — and “at the time” means at the moment
when the Secretary General makes her determination!”°. In the present case, when
the Secretary General gave her authorization on 1 August 2012, Venezuela was no
longer a Party to the ICSID Convention (and Canada had never been; Canada
acceded to the Convention later on, on | December 2013!7!).

But this is not enough: a second assessment of the jurisdictional requirements is
required at the time of institution of the proceedings, because the application for
approval to access the AF could be made and approved years before the filing of
proceedings!” This is expressly permitted by Art. 4(1) of the AF Rules!”*.

In any case, even if the Tribunal were to conclude that the approval by the
Secretary-General had been timely, Rusoro would still be unable to overcome the
obstacle that when this proceeding was registered, the ratione personae
requirements were indisputably not met anymore!”. Art. 4(2)(b) of the AF Rules
specifically refers to the “time when proceedings are instituted” — and that occurs
on the date the request for arbitration is registered!”>.

  

In sum, when a ing jurisdiction ratione personae, the date for determining
Contracting State status is the date of the institution of proceedings. Under ICSID,
including the AF Rules, proceedings are instituted upon registration!”°. And in this

case, the requirements for jurisdiction were not met at the time the agreement to
access the AF Rules was approved or when proceedings were instituted!”’.

CLAIMANT’S POSITION
Rusoro disagrees.

Claimant says that the only relevant date in the present arbitration is the Date of
Request, when it submitted its Request for Arbitration, including its application for
access to ICSID’s AF Rules!”8. Rusoro’s position is confirmed by the AF Rules.
Art. 4(1) provides that a party must apply to the Secretary-General to access the AF
Rules. Art. 4(2) then provides that where either the claimant’s home State or the
respondent State is not an ICSID Contracting State, the Secretary-General shall give
her approval only if she is satisfied that the other State involved is a party to the
Convention “at the time”!”.

The phrase “at the time” refers to the claimant’s application for approval to access
the AF Rules (which was set out in the Request). The French and Spanish versions
are absolutely clear that the relevant time for determining whether the preconditions
have been satisfied is the moment of claimant’s application!®°.

. Rusoro disagrees with the argument that the ratione personae jurisdiction must be

determined twice, once at the date of approval and a second time at the date of
registration of the procedure, which coincides with the date of “institution”.
According to Claimant, Respondent's interpretation would lead to arbitrary results,
depending on the efficiency of the ICSID Secretariat!*!. The tribunal in Venoklim
already had the opportunity to review this issue, and decided that Venezuela’s
reasoning was “‘illogical”!®?,

  

Summing up, Rusoro argues that the only point in time at which the assessment of
ICSID membership should take place is, in accordance with Art. 4(2)(a) of the AF
Rules, the date of claimant’s application for approval — which in this case was made
on the Date of Request, when Venezuela was still an ICSID member State!*?.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

(a) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID), established pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and National of other States, opened
for signature at Washington 18 March, 1965 (ICSID Convention),
provided that both the disputing Contracting Party and the Contracting
Party of the investor are parties to the ICSID Convention; or

(b) the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID, provided that either the disputing
Contracting Party or the Contracting Party of the investor, but not both, is
a party to the ICSID Convention; or

In case neither of the procedures mentioned above is available, the investor
may submit the dispute to an international arbitrator or ad hoc arbitration
tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)”.

 

 

Under this rule, a prospective claimant thus has the option of submitting the
arbitration proceedings to the ICSID Convention (if both States are parties to the
Convention), to the AF Rules (if only one State is party to the Convention), or to
UNCITRAL arbitration, in case neither of these procedures “is available”.

Rusoro opted to submit this dispute to the AF Rules, because at the relevant time
Canada was not a party to the Convention (although it eventually acceded in 2013)
and consequently arbitration under the ICSID Convention was not possible.

Respondent’s jurisdictional objection challenges Rusoro’s decision and submits
that the appropriate venue should have been an UNCITRAL arbitration. Venezuela
argues that it denounced the Convention effective as of 25 July 2012!**, while
ICSID only registered the case thereafter, on the Date of Registration, 1 August
2012, when neither Canada nor Venezuela were parties to the Convention. The
Bolivarian Republic contends that at that time no jurisdiction was available under
the AF Rules, which require that at least one of the affected States be a party to the
Convention. Venezuela asserts that, given the unavailability of the AF Rules,
Rusoro should have initiated UNCITRAL arbitration.

Time line

Pro memoria: the time line of the relevant facts is as follows.

- On 24 January 2012 the Bolivarian Republic denounced the Convention;

- On 17 July 2012, the Date of Request, Rusoro submitted its Request for
Arbitration, including its application for approval to access ICSID’s AF
Rules;

- On 25 July 2012 the denunciation became effective;

- On | August 2012, the Date of Registration, the Secretary-General gave her
approval and ICSID registered the case.

'S The denunciation was made on 24 January 2012, and pursuant to Article 71 of the Convention that
denunciation became effective on 25 July 2012.

260. In essence, the dispute between Rusoro and the Bolivarian Republic comes down
to the following question: which is the relevant date for meeting the requirement
that at least one State be a party to the ICSID Convention? Rusoro argues that the
relevant date is the Date of Request, while Venezuela avers that it is the Date of
Registration'®.

261. The Tribunal unhesitatingly sides with Rusoro.
262. The relevant provisions of the AF Rules read as follows:
“Article 2
Additional Facility

The Secretariat of the Centre is hereby authorized to administer, subject to and
in accordance with these Rules, proceedings between a State (or a constituent
subdivision or agency of a State) and a national of another State, falling within
the following categories:

(a) conciliation and arbitration proceedings for the settlement of legal
disputes arising directly out of an investment which are not within the
jurisdiction of the Centre because either the State party to the dispute or
the State whose national is a party to the dispute is not a Contracting State;

L.]
Article 4

Access to the Additional Facility in Respect of Conciliation and
Arbitration Proceedings Subject to Secretary-General’s Approval

(1) Any agreement providing for conciliation or arbitration proceedings under
the Additional Facility in respect of existing or future disputes requires the
approval of the Secretary-General. The parties may apply for such approval at
any time prior to the institution of proceedings by submitting to the Secretariat
a copy of the agreement concluded or proposed to be concluded between them
together with other relevant documentation and such additional information
as the Secretariat may reasonably request.

(2) In the case of an application based on Article 2(a), the Secretary-General
shall give his approval only if (a) he is satisfied that the requirements of that
provision are fulfilled at the time, and (b) both parties give their consent to the
jurisdiction of the Centre under Article 25 of the Convention (in lieu of the
Additional Facility) in the event that the jurisdictional requirements ratione
personae of that Article shall have been met at the time when proceedings are
instituted”.

185 Venezuela says that the requirement has to be fulfilled twice: at the time of authorization by the Secretary
General plus at the time of institution of the proceedings (R PHB at 43); these two dates can differ in time,
although in the present case they coincide.

Art. 2(a) of the AF Rules authorizes the ICSID Secretariat to administer arbitration
disputes between a State and a national of another State, even if one of the two
States involved is not a party to the ICSID Convention. Such arbitrations are
governed by the AF Rules, and not subject to the provisions of the Convention. Art.
4 then provides that a claimant, to have access to the AF Rules, requires approval
from the Secretary-General of ICSID, which can be requested “at any time prior to
the institution of the proceedings”. Upon receiving the application, the Secretary-
General shall only give her approval if she is satisfied

 

- That the dispute arises directly out of an investment,

- That one the two States involved is “at the time” party to the ICSID
Convention; and

- That the arbitration agreement contains a contingent clause by which the
parties consent to jurisdiction of the Centre under the Convention (and not the
AF Rules) if, by the time proceedings are instituted, both States have become
parties to the Convention!**,

The approval by the Secretary-General

In the present case, on the Date of Request, and together with the filing of its
Request for Arbitration, Rusoro asked the Secretary-General of ICSID for her
approval to administer the arbitration under the AF Rules. On the Date of
Registration, the Secretary-General gave her approval to the use of the AF Rules,
and the arbitration was registered.

 

In reaching her decision to grant the authorization, the Secretary-General concluded
that the two requirements set forth in Art. 4(2) of the AF Rules had been complied
with. The Tribunal sees no reason to disagree with the Secretary-General’s
decision:

(i) Art. 4(2)(a) requires that the dispute must arise directly from an investment
(which is undisputed) and that “at the time” one of the two relevant States must be
a party to the Convention. The Tribunal agrees with the Secretary-General that “at
the time” can only refer to the time when the request for authorization was filed and
not to the date when the authorization is granted. This derives from the plain
language of the provision, and is confirmed by the French and Spanish versions of
the AF Rules, which read as follows!®’:

“Dans le cas d’une demande fondée sur l'article 2(a), le Secrétaire général ne
donne son approbation que si (a) il a la preuve que les conditions stipulé

cette disposition sont remplies au moment oi la demande e:

“[...] el Secretario General dara su aprobacién solamente (a) si a su juicio se
han cumplido los requisitos de esa disposicién [...]”

The tribunal in Venoklim, adjudicating a dispute under the ICSID Convention (not
under the AF Rules), came to an analogous conclusion. In that case, the Request
had been filed on 23 July 2012, but the Secretary-General only registered that
request on 15 August 2012, i.e. once the denunciation of the ICSID Convention by
Venezuela had become effective. Venezuela contended that there was no consent
to ICSID arbitration, because it was not a party to the ICSID Convention when
proceedings were instituted on 15 August 2012'**. The tribunal rejected this
argument on the ground that it would make no sense if a claimant could be
prejudiced by the lapse of an indefinite period between the filing of its request and
the registration by ICSID’s Secretary-General!®’.

 

(ii) The Secretary-General also came to the conclusion that the requirement under
Art. 4(2)(b) of the AF Rules had been met — a conclusion confirmed by Art. XII.4
of the Treaty, which foresees that if Canada and Venezuela both become parties to
the ICSID Convention, any investment dispute will be submitted to ICSID
arbitration (and not to AF arbitration).

No

ility of ac ing UNCITRAL arbitration

      

The Secretary-General’s decision not only made AF arbitration available for
adjudicating the present dispute, but it also provoked a second consequence: it
precluded the possibility of resorting to an UNCITRAL arbitration, because
Art. XIL4 of the Treaty only permits that an investor submit a dispute to
UNCITRAL arbitration “in case neither [ICSID or AF arbitration] is available”. If,
as happened in this case, authorization has been granted to access AF arbitration,
UNCITRAL arbitration becomes unavailable.

 

Venezuela’s averment that in the present case Claimant should have accessed
UNCITRAL arbitration is a legal impossibility: once the decision of the Secretary-
General has made AF arbitration available, Art. XII.4 of the Treaty precludes the
possibility of resorting to the UNCITRAL procedure.

This line of reasoning was forcefully and successfully argued by Venezuela in Nova
Scotia, a case where the positions were reversed: the Canadian investor had filed an
arbitration against Venezuela under the UNCITRAL rules, not under the AF, in the
wrong understanding that AF arbitration was not available. The Bolivarian
Republic successfully challenged the jurisdiction of the UNCITRAL tribunal, with
the reasoning that the investor should have requested authorization to access AF
arbitration, and that, if the investor had done so, AF arbitration would have been
available. In that case, Venezuela accepted that the relevant date for assessing the
availability of the AF was that of submission of the request!°.

If Rusoro had started an UNCITRAL arbitration (as Respondent now avers that
Claimant should have done), and not proceedings under the AF, the Bolivarian

Republic could have challenged the jurisdiction of the UNCITRAL tribunal,
arguing that as of the Date of Request Venezuela was still a party to the Convention,
and that consequently AF arbitration was available. If the new UNCITRAL tribunal
adopted the Nova Scotia doctrine, the Bolivarian Republic would have prevailed.

. The position which Venezuela now adopts in this arbitration is contrary to that

assumed in Nova Scotia, and represents an unacceptable volte-face.

VL3. THE THIRD JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTION:
ILLEGALITY IN THE OWNERSHIP OF MINING
ASSETS

The Bolivarian Republic alleges that Rusoro intentionally disregarded Venezuelan
law in the establishment and throughout the life of the alleged investment, and
therefore, in accordance with Art. I (f) of the Treaty, Claimant’s assets do not
constitute protected investments and Claimant is not a protected investor under the
Treaty.

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

In its Counter-Memorial, Respondent avers that Claimant’s assets were neither
owned nor controlled in accordance with Venezuelan law for three reasons:

 

- First, because Claimant had acquired all of its Mining Rights in violation of
Art. 29 of the Mining Law!”!;

- Second, because Claimant conducted all of its currency transactions on the
grey market, the so-called Swap Market, in order to evade Venezuela’s
foreign exchange controls!°”; and

- Third, because Claimant contravened Venezuela’s gold marketing regime by
refusing to sell to the Central Bank or to export its gold through legal
channels; instead Claimant was supplying the illegal export market in
Venezuela.

In its Rejoinder, Venezuela added two further alleged violations of Venezuelan
law!®3:
- Fourth, Rusoro misrepresented its identity to claim it was a Russian-owned

company before the Venezuelan people and the Venezuelan government; and

- Fifth, Claimant decided to mine the softer saprolite material in violation of
the mine plans and in order to claim higher levels of production.

282.

In its Post Hearing Submission, Venezuela limited its jurisdictional argument to
two alleged breaches committed by Rusoro:

- Claimant allegedly acquired Mining Rights without prior authorization from
the Ministry of Mines as required by Mining Law Art. 29!%; and

- Claimant also failed to report and account for its purported domestic sales or
the final destination of the gold it produced, thus feeding an illegal export
market!®.

 

The Tribunal will review in this section the two jurisdictional arguments invoked
in the PHB. A number of illegality claims, which in the initial submi
viewed as jurisdictional objections, have in the PHB become grounds for
inadmissibility!®° (e.g. the misrepresentation of its Russian identity), and will be
analysed in the Merits section of this Award!®”.

The alleged violation of Art. 29 Mining Law

Rusoro purchased shares in companies that indirectly controlled mining rights in
Venezuela through Venezuelan subsidiaries. The Bolivarian Republic contends that
these acquisitions breached Art. 29 of the Mining Law, which provides that a party
must obtain prior authorization from the Ministry of Mines before acquiring mining
exploration or exploitation rights!**,

Venezuela says that Rusoro acquired all but Bloque B-Isidora in violation of the
prior authorization requirement for the transfer of mining rights under Art. 29 of
the Mining Law!®*. This provision establishes that the exploration and exploitation
rights deriving from the concession are rights in rem. All of Rusoro’s alleged
exploration and exploitation rights were rights in rem derived

- from concessions granted directly by the Ministry of Mines to the Venezuelan
subsidiaries controlled by Rusoro, and from

- concessions granted to the CVG, which later contracted with Rusoro
sul ies the exploration and exploitation rights deriving from these
concessions through leases and operation agreements”.

 

 

Art. 29 Mining Law expressly refers to contracts signed by Regional Development
Corporations like CVG".

The correct reading of Art. 29 requires that it also apply to indirect transfers through

change of control. Any other reading defeats the object and purpose of the norm”.

indirect transfer of rights granted by the State?

3. Moreover, Venezuela’s reading of Art. 29 in this arbitration has been consistently

espoused by government officials at least since 200777.

. Summing up, Rusoro violated Art. 29 by failing to seek and obtain Ministry of

Mines’ authorization before acquiring 57 of the 58 mining rights upon which it
ba aims. Therefore Rusoro did not own and control these 57 mining titles
in accordance with Venezuelan law, and there is no subject-matter with respect to
them?°,

 

Creation of an illegal export market

Finally, Venezuela alleges that Rusoro violated the Mining Law regulations by
failing to report and account for its purported domestic sales or the final destination
of the gold produced, thus feeding an illegal export market”.

THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION
Claimant disagrees.

None of Rusoro’s acquisitions involved a change in the identity of the Venezuelan
company which held the mining rights. Nor was there any transfer of mining rights
themselves. Art. 29 of the Mining Law applies to the situation where a
concessionaire transfers its mining exploration and exploitation rights to another
entity — not to a situation like this one”!°. Venezuela’s construction of this provision
is inconsistent with the plain meaning of Art. 29, which the legislature directed at
the concessionaire, not its shareholders?!!.

Rusoro adds that there is nothing in the text of Art. 29 to suggest that the legislature
intended this requirement to be extended to a change of control of the
concessionaire. The contrary interpretation is inconsistent with basic principles
governing statutory interpretation under Venezuelan law. The favor libertatis
principle requires that provisions which limit economic and contractual freedom be
interpreted restrictively. The principle of legality requires an express enabling
provision authorizing the Ministry of Mines to subject transactions to prior

authorization?!?, Venezuela’s proposed construction is also inconsistent with

change of control to prior governmental authorization, it has done so expressly?!>.

 

THE TRIBUNAL’

 

DEC!

 

Art. I (f) of the Treaty defines “investment” as

“[...] any kind of asset owned or controlled by an investor of one Contracting
Party [...] in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with

the latter’s laws”. [Emphasis added].

 

Venezuela argues that Rusoro acquired its mining assets in contravention of
Venezuela’s mining regulations and specifically of Art. 29 of the Mining Law, and
that consequently the investment does not constitute a protected investment under
the Treaty, which in turn implies that Claimant has no standing in this arbitration
and that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.

 

Rusoro for its part denies that the acquisition of the assets held in Venezuela lead
to any violation of Venezuelan mining legislation, and contends that the
Venezuelan government was perfectly aware of Rusoro’s acquisitions and never
raised any concern, and that the Republic even entered into a joint-venture — called
Venrus — with Rusoro.

Art. 29 of the Mining Law reads as follows”!*:

“Articulo 29: El derecho de exploracién y de explotacién que se deriva de la
concesi6n es un derecho real inmueble. El concesionario podra enajenar dicho
derecho, gravarlo, arrendarlo, sub-arrendarlo, traspasarlo o celebrar sobre el
mismo sub-contrataciones para la explotacién, mediante permiso previo
otorgado por el Ministerio de Energia y Minas, siempre y cuando demuestre

. The starting point of the analysi

Rusoro’s Mining Rights

 

 

is that Rusoro is not the direct holder of any mining
titles in Venezuela. What Claimant did was to acquire (direct or indirect) control of
Venezuelan companies that in their turn were titleholders of Venezuelan mining
rights. These Mining Rights belong to two distinct categories:

- Some Rights take the form of administrative concessions (“concesiones
administrativas”), i.e. iura in rem granted by the Venezuelan State; eight
concessions had been directly granted to Venezuelan companies, while six
concessions had been acquired by Venezuelan companies from the original
concessionaires — and these six acquisitions had been duly authorized by the
Government; Rusoro in its turn had acquired the ownership or control of these
Venezuelan companies;

 

 

- Other mining rights have the legal nature of administrative contracts
(“contratos administrativos”) entered into between the Venezuelan publicly
owned companies CVG and CVG Minerva (which had been incorporated to
further the development of the Guyana region) and Venezuelan companies
which eventually became affiliates of Rusoro; these administrative contracts
include at least 10 lease contracts and 29 operation contracts.

The relevant question thus is whether Claimant, when it indirectly acquired control
over the Venezuelan companies holders of mining rights, without obtaining
authorization from the Venezuelan Government, incurred in a violation of
Venezuelan mining legislation — as Respondent affirms and Claimant denies. To
adjudicate this issue the Tribunal will first establish the applicable provisions of
Venezuelan law (A.); it will then summarize the facts (B.), and in a final section it
will analyse whether Rusoro has violated these provisions (C.).

A. Provisions of Venezuelan law

Mining activities under Venezuelan Law are regulated in the Mining Law?!>. The
basic principle of the Law — established in Art. 2, which reiterates Art. 12 of the
Constitution — is that mines or mineral deposits of any type existing in the national
territory belong to the Republic, are public property and therefore inalienable and
imprescriptible?!®.

Mining concessions

Art. 7 of the Mining Law establishes that exploration and exploitation of mineral
resources may be carried out through administrative concession, and in the case of
small-scale mining also by administrative authorization?!’. In Art. 24 the Mining

Law then defines that an administrative concession is

 

“el acto del Ejecutivo Nacional, mediante el cual se otorgan derechos e
imponen obligaciones a los particulares para el aprovechamiento de los
recursos minerales existentes en el territorio nacional. La concesién minera

confiere a su titular el derecho exclusivo a la exploracién y explotacién de las
sustancias minerales otorgadas que se encuentren dentro del Ambito espacial
concedido”.

This article does not consider the concession as a contract, and even less so as an
intuitu personae relationship, but rather as a unilateral State act which creates a ius
in rem. Art. 29 of the Law explicitly declares that

“El derecho de exploracién y de explotacién que se deriva de la concesién es
un derecho real inmueble”.

This conclusion is reinforced by Art. 67, which regulates small scale mining, and
expressly states that the rights conferred to small scale miners are intuitu personae
and do not constitute ira in rem?!8;

 

“Articulo 67: El derecho de explotacién que se deriva del ejercicio de la
actividad de la pequefia mineria es a titulo precario, se otorga intuitu personae,
y en consecuencia, no confiere derechos reales inmuebles, Por | lo que no podra
ser enajenado, gravado, arrendado, traspasado ni cedido; [...

Mining contracts granted by CVG

The basic instrument created by the Mining Law for the exploration and
exploitation of mineral deposits is the concession, granted by the State in favour of
the concessionaire. What the Law fails to regulate, however, is the pre-existing
situation of CVG?!°, which had been entrusted with certain mining rights in the
Guyana region by the 1945 Mining Law and by Decree No. 1409 of 199172°.

Before the enactment of the 1999 Mining Law, CVG had signed a number of lease
agreements with private third parties, which granted the private party the right to
explore and exploit certain mineral deposits?!. Such contracts, which do not
constitute a ius in rem?’, continue to be valid and binding after the enactment of
the present Mining Law and are regulated by the general provisions on contracts
provided for by Venezuelan law. Art. 132 of the present Mining Law creates a
special transitory regime: these contracts can be transformed into concessions — a
possibility which in the case of Rusoro was not applied”?

   

Transfer of conc:

 

ions

 

Art. 29 of the Mining Law regulates the transfer of conc
the rule clarifies the legal nature of mining concessions: they are “derechos reales
inmuebles”. The article then provides as follows?”4:

“El concesionario podra enajenar dicho derecho, gravarlo, arrendarlo, sub-
arrendarlo, traspasarlo 0 celebrar sobre el mismo sub-contrataciones para la

explotacién, mediante permiso previo otorgado por el Ministerio de Energia y
Minas, siempre y cuando demuestre efectivamente que la negociacién cuya
autorizaci6n se solicita, se haré exclusivamente para el eficiente desarrollo del
proyecto de explotacién, previamente aprobado por este Ministerio y dentro
de los lapsos autorizados para la ejecucién del mismo.”

 

 

Concessions are iura in rem, and as such can be transferred, leased or encumbered,
subject only to the previous authorization from the Minister of Mines.

 

The addressee of the requirement established in Art. 29 is the concessionaire, the
person or company holder of the ius in rem. The object whose transfer requires
administrative authorization is the concession itself. This conclusion is confirmed
by Art. 29 Pardégrafo Segundo, which provides that the transfer must be registered

in the land registry?*>:

 

“los traspasos deberan ser presentados para su protocolizacién por ante la
Oficina Subalterna de Registro de la Circunscripcién”.

Since only concessions, being iura in rem, can be registered at the land registry, it
is clear that the scope of the authorization required by Art. 29 can only refer to
concessions — not to administrative contracts, which cannot be registered in the land
registry.

 

. A second aspect is relevant: the law only applies to the requirement of

 

administrative authorization to the transfer or encumbrance of the concession itself.
In accordance with the literal reading of the rule, such requirement of prior approval
under Art. 29 does not extend to the transfer (or encumbrance) of a controlling
interest over a company which holds concessions. The sale of the shares of a
company which has separate legal personality does not affect the concession, which
is not transferred and remains as an asset of the concessionaire company. Since the
concession is not transferred, the registration at the land registry is not affected, and
the administrative authorization requirement is not triggered?”°.

   

 

Transfer of mining contracts granted by CVG

The transfer of mining contracts granted by CVG (and by CVG-Minerven) is not
subject to Art. 29 of the Mining Law, because this provision is only concerned with
the transfer of mining concessions, and the mining contracts do not have the legal
status of concessions. The CVG transfers are governed by the general rules on
transfer of contracts under Venezuelan law and by the contractual arrangements
agreed upon by the parties.

 

  

CVG did give thought to the possibility that its counterparty might decide to assign
the contract, or that ownership of the counterparty might change. For this reason,
the contracts signed between CVG and the Venezuelan companies eventually
acquired by Rusoro included specific clauses, requiring CVG’s authorization for
the assignment to a third party. In at least one case the contractual language required

CVG’s approval for the change of control of the Venezuelan counterparty with
whom CVG had signed the lease agreement’.

B. Relevant facts

It is undisputed that Rusoro never directly acquired mining rights in Venezuela and
that, when Rusoro acquired control of the Venezuelan companies holding such
mining rights, it never asked or obtained any authorization from the Venezuelan
State.

There is no evidence however that Rusoro took any action to hide its acquisitions
from the Venezuelan authorities. To the contrary, there is ample evidence that
Rusoro, as a company controlled (at least initially) by Russian shareholders and
managed by Russian citizens, enjoyed excellent relationships with the Venezuelan
authorities”. All of the investments made by Rusoro were publicly announced,
were published in the press, information was disclosed on the Canadian stock
market and reported in Rusoro’s published annual accounts. Venezuelan Ministers
visited Rusoro’s sites and Mr. Agapov, Rusoro’s chief executive, met a number of
times with high representatives of the Venezuelan Government, including President
Chavez.

There is express evidence in the file that in one case, the acquisition of Gold Fields,
Rusoro actually wrote to the Minister of Mines to inform him of the transaction”.
It is telling that the letter starts with the following phrase:

 

“A pesar de que el acuerdo se ha celebrado entre empresas no domiciliadas en
Venezuela, consideramos de suma importancia hacer participe del mismo al
Ministerio que usted dirige y, en general, al Gobierno Nacional”.

The phrase indicates that Rusoro’s understanding at the time was that no
authorization was required, because the transaction had been effected between two
foreign corporations, and that it was informing the Government as a sign of
goodwill.

Venezuela has not filed any letter or communication from the Minister of Mines
either rejecting Rusoro’s interpretation of the law or requesting a formal application
for authorization. It must thus be assumed that no such reaction took place. To the
contrary, in July 2008 the Venezuelan Government, rather than raising concerns,
entered into a formal partnership with Rusoro, known as Venrus, and signed a
Commitment Agreement.

Examination of Sr. Marcano

   

Venezuela’s former Director of Mining Concessions at the Ministry of Mines, Sr.
Reinaldo Marcano, provided testimony as a witness in these proceedings. He

27 See para. 316 et seq infra.

8 See Vladimir Agapov II with an extensive discussion of his meetings with Ministers and with President
Chavez; see HT at 353:19 where Mr. Agapov represents that he met President Chavez at least 20 times and
received his support each time.

° Doc. C-352 — Letter from Rusoro to MIBAM, p 1.

confirmed that the Ministry was aware of Rusoro’s indirect acquisitions”, he
averred that he himself was of the opinion that indirect acquisition of mining rights
required authorization under Art. 29 of the Mining Law, but that he never put his
advice in writing, and that his personal view was not shared by the Ministry’s Legal
Department”*!.

 

311. Sr. Marcano’s testimony appears to give a good summary of the Bolivarian
Republic’s attitude throughout this period: the official position of the Legal
Department of the Ministry of Mines supported a literal interpretation of Art. 29 of
the Mining Law, implying that indirect acq' ions of mining rights were excluded
from the need of obtaining an administrative authorization. That official position
was compatible with the personal opinion of certain civil servants, according to
which from a policy point of view the Republic should also supervise indirect
acquisitions — but that this was a de lege ferenda objective, which for its
implementation would have required an amendment of the Mining Law.

 

Admit tive practice

312. Venezuela’s administrative practice with regard to the granting of mining
authorizations reinforces this conclusion.

313. The Republic has not presented any evidence showing that in a case of indirect
transfers of mining rights it ever requested a foreign investor to petition an
authorization under Art. 292°”. Neither has the Republic presented any evidence that
it actually granted an authorization for an indirect transfer (although many indirect
transfers in the mining sector must have taken place). Finally, Venezuela has not
adduced any evidence of the imposition of fines or sanctions to foreign investors
who made indirect acquisitions of mining rights in Venezuela without obtaining
Government approval.

 

 

314. This practice chimes with Venezuela’s attitude vis is Rusoro. Before this
arbitration, Venezuela at no time made any representation that Rusoro was acting
illegally when it acquired mining rights in Venezuela through the indirect taking of
control of foreign holding companies, without requesting or obtaining
administrative authorization. To the contrary: in June 2007 the Government
extended Rusoro’s mining rights over the El Placer mine through 2017 and in

20 HT at 1067:21.

231 HT at 1143:10.

282 In its PHB at 79 Venezuela refers to Doc. R-68, a memorandum of a meeting between officials of the
Ministry of Mines and Gold Fields, the South-African Company, from whom Rusoro afterwards bought
mining assets. In that meeting a Ministry official is quoted as making the statement that Gold Fields had
bought without obtaining administrative authorisation (“GF no solicité autorizaci6n del MIBAM para la
compra de BGC”). The official does not state that this behaviour was illegal or contrary to the Mining Law.
The memorandum reinforces the Tribunal’s position: Venezuelan officials accepted that under Art. 29 of
the Mining Law an authorization was not required (even if, from a policy point of view, the requirement of
such authorization would have been welcomed). It is worth noting that when Rusoro eventually acquired
Gold Field’s mining interests, it informed the Ministry (without requesting authorization). In R II at 207,
the Respondent also referred to a letter from CVG to Inversiones Goldwana (Doc. R-54), in which CVG
asked for information regarding an indirect transfer of ownership. This letter does not refer to Art. 29, and
once again reinforces the conclusion that the continuing administrative practice was not to require consent
under Art. 29.

September 2009 granted exploitation rights over the Increible 6 mine for a period
of 20 years”.

Summing up, there is no evidence in the file suggesting that Rusoro acted with
fraud, bad faith or mens rea when it purchased mining rights in Venezuela indirectly
by taking control of foreign companies which held those rights. To the contrary, the
evidence shows that Rusoro adhered to the interpretation of Art. 29 of the Mining
Law then favoured by the Venezuelan authorities and to the administrative practice
applied at that time by the Venezuelan Ministry of Mines.

Bloque B

There is however one exception to the general rule that Rusoro never asked nor
obtained administrative authorization. That exception is the acquisition of El
Callao, the Hecla subsidiary which held mining rights for the so-called Bloque B.
In this case an authorization does indeed exist. But the cause for and the justification
of this authorization has been the object of intense discussion between the parties.

Hecla Mining Company and CVG-Minerven, a State-owned mining company, had
in 2002 signed a lease agreement for the exploitation of gold in an area known as
Bloque B. In 2008 Hecla agreed the sale of Hecla’s assets in Venezuela to Rusoro,
the transaction to be executed through a transfer of shares in non-Venezuelan
companies. On 15 May 2008?*4 Hecla and Rusoro sent a joint letter to CVG-
Minerven giving details of the intended transaction and asking for CVG-
Minerven’s consent to the indirect assignment of the lease agreement?

 

 

“de conformidad con lo previsto en la cldusula 20.1 del Contrato de
Arrendamiento”.

 

It is important to note that the letter was addressed to CVG-Minerven, not to the
Minister, and that the b: ‘or requesting the authorization was clause 20.1 of the
lease agreement, which required CVG-Minerven’s consent for any indirect change
of ownership affecting Hecla.

 

The answer to that letter came not from CVG-Minerven but from the “Ministro del
Poder Popular para las Industrias B: s y Mineria’”’. The Minister’s letter, dated 3
July 2008, is undoubtedly a reply to the 15 May 2008 joint letter from Hecla and
Rusoro, because in its introductory paragraph there is an express statement to that
effect. The Minister then authorizes the “cesién indirecta del contrato de
arrendamiento”, and invokes Art. 29 of the Mining Law as the basis for his
decision?*°,

 

 

There is no clear explanation why the Minister invoked Art. 29 of the Mining Law
- a provision which had not been mentioned in Rusoro’s request for authorization.

*4 Doc. C-357 — Letter from El Callao Gold Mining Co. and Rusoro to CVG Minerven, p. 1. The letter is
dated 12 May 2008, but it has a stamp from CVG-Minerven that it was received on 15 May 2008.

Sr. Marcano suggested in cross-examination that there might have been a second
request from Rusoro, asking for authorization under Art. 29, and that such letter had
been lost in the Ministry’s files and could not be produced?*’. This seems an
unlikely explanation, because the Minister’s letter explicitly replies to the existing
15 May 2008 joint letter from Rusoro and Hecla. Two letters on the same date to
ask for the same authorization seems an unlikely practice.

The more convincing explanation is that the civil servant who prepared the
Minister’s letter adhered to the template normally used when granting mining
authorizations under Art. 29 of the Mining Law and simply applied that template to
a different situation, in which the authorization was not required under that rule, but
rather under the terms and conditions of the lease agreement.

. Whatever the explanation, the authorization granted for Bloque B does not change

the Tribunal’s finding that Venezuela’s practice throughout the relevant period was
neither to request nor to grant authorizations for indirect transfers of mining rights
under Art. 29 of the Mining Law.

C. Rusoro did not violate Art. 29

Venezuela argues that Art. 29 does apply to indirect transfers of all types of mining
rights, even if such transfers are effected through the change of control of entities
holding mining rights. In Venezuela’s opinion the contrary reading of the rule
defeats the object and purpose of Art. 29. If indirect transfers could be permitted
without prior consent, the requirement of Art. 29 could be easily circumvented, thus
rendering the provision meaningless?*’.

The Tribunal disagrees.

The proper interpretation of Art. 29 of the Mining Law proves that the Venezuelan
legislator only had the intention to submit to administrative authorization the
transfer or encumbrance of concessions — not the indirect transfer of control of
companies holding concessions (or other mining rights like CVG Contracts).

Art. 4 of the Civil Code provides the basic rule for the interpretation of laws in the
Venezuelan legal system”:

“A la ley debe atribuirsele el sentido que aparece evidente del significado
propio de las palabras, segtin la conexién de ellas entre si y la intencién del
legislador”.

Indirect transfer of concessions

 

Art. 29 of the Mining Law is inserted in Chapter IV of the Law, titled “De las
Concesiones”. The literal wording of the rule limits its scope of application to
mining concessions, it declares that such concessions are iura in rem, that the

332.

. Art. 29 paragraph | reads as follows’

transfer and encumbrance of such concessions requires administrative authorization
and in its final paragraph adds that transfers must be registered at the land registry.

 

The intention of the legislator can be clearly derived from the words used: the aim
of the provision is to regulate the legal nature of mining concessions, their
registration at the land registry and their transfer and encumbrance. There is no
indication that the legislator wanted to regulate other activities, like the transfer of
control over companies holding mining concessions. And the words used to convey
the legislator’s intent also do not give rise to any ambiguity: the rule reiteratively
refers to “mining concessions”, not to the shareholding of companies owning
mining concessions.

 

 

 

Venezuela’s proposed construction is inconsistent with basic principles governing
statutory interpretation under Venezuelan law. The favor libertatis principle
requires that provisions which limit a private party’s economic and contractual
freedom — such as Art. 29 — be interpreted restrictively°. The principle of legality
recognized under the Venezuelan Constitution’*! further requires an express
enabling provision authorizing the Ministry to subject transactions between private
parties to its prior permission”“.

A comparative analysis of other administrative laws adopted by Venezuela shows
that the Venezuelan legislator was perfectly aware that the transfer of an
administrative concession can be distinguished from the change of control of a
company holding a concession. When the Venezuelan legislature intended to
subject a change of control to prior governmental approval, it has done so expressly.
In the Ley de Bosques the legislator has chosen to submit to administrative
authorization not only the transfer of forest rights, but also indirect changes of
control™7. The same applies to the Gold Nationalization Law’. The fact that the
Mining Law lacks any language extending the requirement of administrative
authorization to transfers of controlling companies holding mining concessions, is
a powerful indicator that the intent of the Venezuelan legislator was to exclude such
transfers from the scope of the required administrative consent.

  
  

 

 

Mining contri under Art. 29, paragraph 1

Venezuela has also drawn the Tribunal’s attention to Art. 29, paragraph 1 of the
Mining Law, which refers to “arrendamiento de una concesién cuyos titulares sean
Corporaciones Regionales de Desarrollo”*45. In Venezuela’s opinion, this would
show that Art. 29 also covers mining contracts, and not only concessions.

“En caso de arrendamiento de una concesién cuyos titulares sean

arrendatarios tendran la obligacién de pagar los impuestos establecidos en esta
Ley; salvo que el arrendamiento se Ileve a cabo con otros entes de cardcter
ptiblico, también exentos del pago de impuestos”.

Venezuela’s argument is without merit.

The question is not whether Art. 29, in its paragraph 1, includes a reference to the
tax status of mining contracts signed by Corporaciones Regionales de Desarrollo
like CGV (it does). The question is whether the requirement of administrative
authorization, which Art. 29 in its initial paragraph establishes for transfers or
encumbrances of concessions, can be extended to changes in the control of
companies holding such concessions. Art. 29, paragraph 1 does not affect the
conclusion. The plain language of the rule is that such extension is not provided for.

 

 

 

Decisions of the Venezuelan Courts

The parties have not drawn the Tribunal’s attention to any ruling from the
Venezuelan Courts addressing the issue whether transfers of shares in companies
which hold mining concessions fall under the authorization requirement of Art. 29
of the Mining Law.

Prof. Mourifio, Venezuela’s legal expert, however, offered one authority in support
of Venezuela’s interpretation of the law: the 2011 Minca case*4’, where the
Venezuelan Supreme Court characterized as intuitu personae a joint venture
relationship between a private company and CVG, formed to develop the Las
Cristinas reserve”*,

In fact, the Minca case is inapposite, since it does not address the issue under
discussion.

Minca was a mixed enterprise, incorporated by CVG together with a private partner,
Placer Dome de Venezuela CA, which had been selected through a competitive
bidding procedure. Both shareholders signed a shareholders agreement, which
included a specific clause prohibiting assignments to third parties, except with the
authorization of the other party. Placer Dome de Venezuela CA then transferred its
shares to another company, Vanessa de Venezuela CA, and the Supreme Court
declared the nullity of such transfer, because the authorization from CVG, required
under the shareholders agreement, had not been provided”"?. The Minca decision
does not contain a single reference to Art. 29 of the Mining Law. It does not address
whether the authorization under that rule extends to indirect transfers of shares. It
simply comes to the rather unobjectionable conclusion that transfers of shares
which violate an authorization requirement embedded in a shareholders agreement
signed between a State party and a private party selected through a bidding
procedure, are null and void.

D. Conclusion
The Tribunal thus dismisses Venezuela’s jurisdictional objection

- that Rusoro acquired its mining assets in contravention of Venezuela’s mining
regulations,

- that the investment does not constitute a protected investment under the
Treaty,

- that Claimant has no standing in this arbitration and

- that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.

 

Rusoro formalized its investment in Venezuela through the acquisition or control
of non-Venezuelan corporations, an activity which did not require administrative
authorization from the Venezuelan authorities. The fact that these non-Venezuelan
corporations in their turn controlled Venezuelan companies holding mining
concessions and contracts did not trigger the requirement of administrative consent
set forth in Art. 29 of the Mining Law. The Venezuelan government was aware of
Rusoro’s acquisitions and at the relevant time never raised any concern.

Creation of an illegal export market

Venezuela devotes two and a half lines of its PHB to the argument that in the course
of its mining activities Rusoro violated “the Mining Law Regulations” by failing to
report and account for its purported domestic sales or the final destination of the
gold produced, thus feeding an illegal export market.

3. Venezuela’s argument is doomed to fail:

- First, because Venezuela only identifies two rules, contained in the
Reglamento General de Minas of 20017°°, which allegedly had been breached
by Rusoro:

- Art. 33, which creates an obligation for concessionaires to periodically send
statistical information to the Ministry of Mines?*!, and

- Art. 74, which refers to the “Guias de Circulacién” which must be issued to
formalize deliveries of any mineral from the mine”;

- Second, because Venezuela fails to marshal any evidence that in the period
of 2007-2008 Rusoro actually failed to properly report the requisite statistical
information or moved gold without the correct “Guia de Circulacién”. If these
violations of the Reglamento General de Minas had actually happened, the
Ministry of Mines and its inspectorate must for sure have become aware, and

there would be written requirements demanding compliance. No such
evidence has been adduced.

344. In summary, Venezuela has failed to prove that Rusoro did not own and exploit its
investments in Venezuela “in accordance with [Venezuela’s] law”, as required by
Art. I (f) of the Treaty.

VII. RUSORO’S CLAIMS

‘5. Having rejected Venezuela’s three jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal must now
address Rusoro’s merits claims, namely that the Bolivarian Republic, in violation
of the BIT, expropriated Claimant’s investment (VII.2.), that it failed to accord Fair
and Equitable Treatment, Full Protection and Security, national treatment and free
transfer to such investment (VII.3.)

 
  

6. Before doing so, however, the Tribunal must briefly address two preliminary issues
(VII.1): the applicable legal framework and the Republic’s defence that the merits
claims are inadmissible because Rusoro incurred in bad faith conduct’.

 
  

VIL1. PRELIMINARY ISSUES

LEGAL FRAMEWORK

a

Article 54(1) of the Arbitration AF Rules provide: follows:

 

“The Tribunal shall apply the rules of law designated by the parties as
applicable to the substance of the dispute”

8. Canada and Venezuela have done so in Article XII(7) of the BIT:

“A tribunal established under this Article™! shall decide the issues in dispute
in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.
An interpretation of this Agreement to which both Contracting Parties have
agreed shall be binding upon the tribunal”.

9. The Tribunal must consequently adjudicate the present dispute applying the BIT
and the rules of international law. Neither Claimant nor Respondent have drawn the
Tribunal’s attention to the existence of any common interpretation of the BIT made
by the Bolivarian Republic and Canada.

 

CLAIMANT’S GOOD FAITH

0. The Bolivarian Republic says that Rusoro’s claims are inadmissible, because it did
not pursue its investments in good faith

- By taking control of Venezuelan mining rights through offshore corporate
transactions without the Government's authorization> and

- By misrepresenting its identity as a Rus: 256

354.

355.

356.

The Republic’s first argument can be swiftly rejected: the Tribunal has already
found that Rusoro did not incur in a violation of Art. 29 of the Mining Law when it
indirectly acquired control of its Mining Rights, and that Rusoro, enjoyed excellent
relationships with the Venezuelan authorities’. All of the investments made by
Rusoro were publicly announced, were published in the press, information was
disclosed on the Canadian stock market and reported in Rusoro’s published annual
accounts. Venezuelan Ministers visited Rusoro’s sites and Mr. Agapov, Rusoro’s
chief executive, met a number of times with President Chavez. These facts are
incompatible with Venezuela’s ex post argument that Rusoro did not pursue its
investments in good faith.

Misrepresentation of Rusoro’s identity

. The second argument is also untenable.

. Since its incorporation, Rusoro was a Canadian corporation, publicly traded on the

Canadian stock exchange, whose shareholding was a matter of public record?®. It
is true that its init areholders and its management were of Russian nationality,
and that later on, as a consequence of su sive corporate acquisitions and
mergers, Russian control was diluted. There is no evidence, however, that Rusoro
acted in bad faith and tried to mislead the Venezuelan officials. The Bolivarian
Republic’s only evidence is a letter dated October 29, 2007 sent by Mr. Vladimir
Agapov, the Chairman of Rusoro, to Minister José S. Khan’.

  

  

In that letter Mr. Agapov defines “Rusoro Mining Ltd” as “poseida
mayoritariamente por ciudadanos rusos” and then goes on to explain that Rusoro
has acquired the Venezuelan gold mining activities from the South African
company Gold Fields, that Gold Fields will become a “socia minoritaria” at Rusoro,
that he and his son Andre will continue holding “el control accionario y directivo”,
that he will continue to be “Presidente” and his son “Director Ejecutivo” and that
the “Consejo Consultivo” will be constituted by three Russian citizens.

 

 

During his examination, Mr. Agapov acknowledged that before the Gold Fields
transaction his personal participation in Rusoro amounted to 38%7°° and that after
the transaction his participation was diluted to 18.2%". It is also undisputed that
throughout the relevant period Mr. Agapov senior was the Chairman of Rusoro, his
son its CEO, and that both together controlled the company de facto (through their
minority holding and in agreement with other shareholders). There is no allegation
that Mr. Agapov breached his promise that Rusoro’s “Consejo Consultivo” would
consist of Russian individuals.

 

  

Given these facts, the Tribunal does not see any bad faith or intention to mislead in
Rusoro’s decision to send the October 29, 2007 letter to Minister Khan. To the
contrary: under Venezuelan law, the acquisition of Gold Fields, through a merger

with Rusoro, did not require administrative authorization, and did not even have to
be communicated to the Venezuelan government. Rusoro voluntarily informed the
authorities, and gave a reasonably precise overview of the forthcoming transactions
and the impact on Rusoro’s shareholders.

VIL2. EXPROPRIATION

Rusoro’s fundamental claim is that Venezuela expropriated Rusoro’s investments
for Venezuela’s own economic benefit in violation of Article VII(1) of the BIT,
which provides as follows:

“Investments or returns of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be
nationalized, expropriated or subject to measures having an effect equivalent
to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”)
in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for a public purpose,
under due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and against prompt,
adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall be based on
the genuine value of the investment or returns expropriated immediately
before the expropriation or at the time the proposed expropriation became
public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall be payable from the date of
expropriation with interest at a normal commercial rate, shall be paid without
delay and shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable”.

Both Parties agree that the BIT does not prohibit nationalization, and the Bolivarian
Republic does not contest that as a consequence of the Nationalization Decree it
actually nationalized Rusoro’s Mining Rights in Venezuela. There is thus ample
coincidence between both Parties that expropriation has indeed happened. The real
issue to be discussed is the amount of compensation, and certain ancillary issues
(whether the expropriation is lawful or unlawful, and whether it was accomplished
in one single act or by a chain of successive events).

 

CLAIMANT’S POSITION

Claimant alleges that it has suffered both a direct expropriation and a creeping
expropriation”.

Claimant avers that when on 16 September 2011 the Bolivarian Republic passed
the Nationalization Decree it expropriated Rusoro’s Mining Rights, transferred all
assets to the State, destroyed the value of Rusoro’s subsidiaries, and deprived the
investment of all economic value”®. This direct expropriation was unlawful, not
only because Venezuela has never paid any compensation for Rusoro’s Mining
Rights or the shares in the subsidiaries”, but also because it was not carried out

under due process of law*®, because it was discriminatory*® and not for a public

purpose”*7,

 

Rusoro avers that it also suffered a creeping expropriation: the Bolivarian Republic
adopted a premeditated plan to obtain State control of the gold sector”. Starting
in April 2009, Venezuela allegedly enacted a series of interconnected measures
targeting Rusoro’s gold mining business and culminating in the outright
nationalization of Rusoro’s investment through the Nationalization Decree.
Claimant submits that taken together, Venezuela’s chain of actions resulted in the
expropriation of Rusoro’s investment?” and that this creeping expropriation implies
a composite breach of the BIT. Rusoro is entitled to compensation for the fair
market value of its investment, excluding the effect of all measures comprising
Venezuela’s premeditated plan to extract greater economic benefits from the gold
sector?”,

 

RESPONDENT’S POSITION

. The Bolivarian Republic takes the stand that the right to nationalize or expropriate

is a sovereign right of States, affirmed by international scholars and investment
tribunals?”!.

. Respondent adds that the BIT permits nationalization and that it complied with the

BIT’s requirements when it expropriated Claimant’s Mining Rights:

- Due process was respected”,

- The Nationalization Decree was non-discriminatory?”,

- The expropriation was effected for a public purpose?”4.

The only BIT requirement not complied with is that no compensation has been paid,
the reasons being that after six months of negotiations, Claimant failed to reach an
agreement with Venezuela on the amount of compensation (or the conditions for
forming a joint venture)’. The Parties’ failure to agree on the amount of
compensation does not render nationalization unlawful per se?”

Venezuela offered book value for the expropriated assets, and book value can
represent the genuine value of the investment”’’. Furthermore, the Nationalization

Decree offered another alternative: the possibility of negotiating a joint venture
agreement?’*, Thus Venezuela engaged in good faith negotiations regarding a joint
venture regime and appropriate compensation for Claimant, despite the fact that
Claimant did not have proper title to the investment?””. Rusoro did not like the offer
made by the Bolivarian Republic, because that offer did not match Rusoro’s own
inflated valuation. But a disagreement over valuation between a State and an
investor is not a breach of international law by the State. It simply makes immediate
payment of compensation impossible because the private party is unwilling to
accept the compensation offered by the State?®°.

As regards Venezuela’s regulatory actions before 2011, these did not imply an
indirect expropriation of Claimant’s investment, because they were not part of a
plan to expropriate Rusoro’s assets. There is no evidence that these regulatory
actions before 2011 were interconnected. Venezuela sustains that all of them were
distinct policy decisions taken by various government entities and based upon
different and legitimate reasons”*!. These actions represented a legitimate exercise
of government regulation in the public interest — not expropriation.

   

Claimant knew about the strict monetary controls in place before acquiring its
interests in Venezuela. It was aware that since 2003 exporters of gold were required
to sell 90% of the foreign currency obtained from exports to the BCV at the Official
Exchange Rate. Any reasonable investor would have expected a prudent
government to increase exchange control in order to stop illegal and law-evading
conduct, as Venezuela did?®2.

In the gold market, sales to the BCV and authorized exports had halted, and at the
same time gold production overall was increasing, or at least holding steady.
Venezuela rationally took action to address the discrepancy”*>.

Venezuela engaged in lawful and appropriate State action to regulate the gold
mining industry and enforce financial and monetary policies in the public interest.

These measures were not expropriatory?**.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECI

 

There are three questions, which the Tribunal must address: whether a direct
expropriation of Rusoro’s investment has occurred (3.1.), whether such
expropriation meets the requirements set forth in the BIT (3.2.) and finally, whether
the Bolivarian Republic also incurred in a creeping expropriation of Claimant’s
assets (3.3.).

DIRECT EXPROPRIATION
In accordance with Art. VII.1 of the Treaty,

“Investments or returns of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be
nationalized, expropriated or subject to measures having an effect equivalent
to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”)
in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for a public purpose,
under due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and against prompt,
adequate and effective compensation”.

The Tribunal will first summarize the proven facts (A.) and then establish whether
such facts give rise to a nationalization (B.).

A. Proven facts

- On 17 August 2011 President Chavez publicly announced the immediate

nationalization of the gold mining industry in Venezuela. Shortly after, on 16
September 2011, Venezuela adopted the Nationalization Decree with “rango, valor
y fuerza de Ley Organica”, which

- declared all assets and operations associated with the mining and exploitation
of gold in Venezuela of “utilidad publica e interés social”,
- provided for State control of the property and mining rights of all gold

producing companies,

- ordered the transfer of all existing concessions or contracts to Mixed
Companies, controlled by the State,

- decreed the automatic extinction of all existing concessions or contracts if
holders did not agree within 90 days to their transfer to Mixed Companies,

- ordered that compensation to investors be equal to the book value of the
investment.

 

Venezuela then issued Resolutions 88 and 89, dated 7 October 2011, which created
a single Negotiation Commission for the whole gold industry, with the task of
transferring all gold concessions, contracts and leases to new Mixed Companies,
and an OTC entrusted with the authority of taking control over and managing all
gold assets to be nationalized, with mandates expiring on 15 December 2011.

Negotiations between Rusoro and the Negotiation Commission started in
September 2011 and continued through December. On 15 December 2011, the last
day of negotiations, Venezuela adopted an Amendment Decree, extending the
deadline for reaching agreement for another 90 days.

 

On 13 March 2012 a final meeting between Rusoro and PDVSA (the State-owned
oil company which was acting on behalf of the State) took place. It became clear
that no agreement on compensation could be reached, and negotiations were
suspended. The next day, 14 March 2012, the negotiation period expired with no
agreement between Rusoro and the Government having been reached.

Accordingly, all Mining Rights held by Rusoro through its subsidiaries were
automatically extinguished by law as of 15 March 2012. After Rusoro’s formal
withdrawal from the mining areas on 31 March 2012, all of Rusoro’s Mining Rights
and other assets located in Venezuela were taken over by the Bolivarian Republic.

No compensation has been paid by the Bolivarian Republic for the nationalization
of Rusoro’s Mining Rights and other assets located in Venezuela.

B. Nationalization

It is undisputed that the Bolivarian Republic expropriated all the Mining Rights and

other assets, indirectly held by Rusoro in Venezuela through local subsidiaries. The

legal basis for such nationalization was the Nationalization Decree, issued by the

President of the Bolivarian Republic and countersigned by the cabinet, which had

“rango, valor y fuerza de Ley Organica”. The Nationalization Decree effected

- the nationalization of the gold sector (i.e. the expropriation of a natural
resource or of an industrial sector for the direct benefit of the State or of its

agencies and enterprises)**>, as well as

- the appropriation by the Bolivarian Republic of Rusoro’s interest in the
Mining Rights and other assets held through its Venezuelan subsidiaries.

REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED IN ART. VIL.1

The BIT does not forbid States to expropriate assets owned or controlled by
investors, nor to nationalize natural resources or economic sectors. But the BIT
establishes four requirements which the State must comply with in order for the
expropriation or nationalization to be lawful: the measure

- must be adopted for a public purpose,

- under due process of law,

- in a non-discriminatory manner and

- ensure prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

A. Public purpose

According to Venezuela, sovereigns enjoy wide latitude in determining whether an
action is taken for a public purpose. The sovereign determination of a public

purpose should not be second-guessed?*°. Venezuela’s actions directly responded
to troublesome developments in the gold mining sector: environmental harm and

violation of rights of the workers”*’ and their purpose was to ensure sustainable and
socially responsible exploitation of natural resources

 

Rusoro disagrees. Venezuela’s assertion that the “capitalist mining model” has
caused serious detriment and that nationalization was an appropriate means to
mitigate is unsupported. There is no evidence linking Rusoro’s operations with
alleged negative effects claimed to have inspired the nationalization”. The real
motivation for the expropriation was the desire to boost Venezuela’s gold reserves.
The nationalization of Rusoro’s assets was designed to achieve political advantage
for the State by seizing massive value at the expense of a foreign company”.

 

 

 

 

   

The Tribunal’s p mn
The purpose of the Nationalization Decree is stated in its Preamble and its Art. 1:

“Con el supremo compromiso y voluntad de lograr la mayor eficacia politica
y calidad revolucionaria en la construccién del socialismo y el
engrandecimiento del pais, basado en los principios humanistas y en las
condiciones éticas Bolivarianas...”

 

“Articulo 1: El presente Decreto Ley tiene por objeto regular lo relativo al
régimen de las minas y yacimientos de oro, la reserva al Estado de las
actividades primarias, conexas y accesorias al aprovechamiento de dicho
mineral, y la creaci6n de empresas para su ejercicio, con el propésito de
revertir los graves efectos del modelo minero capitalista, caracterizado por la
degradacién del medio ambiente, el irrespeto de la ordenacién territorial, el
atentado a la dignidad y la salud de las mineras y mineros y pobladoras [y]
pobladores de las comunidades aledafias a las dreas mineras, a través de la
auténtica vinculacién de la actividad de explotacién del oro con la ejecucién
de politicas ptiblicas que se traduzcan en el vivir bien del pueblo, la proteccién
ambiental y el desarrollo nacional”.

The stated purpose of the Nationalization Decree is consequently

- The construction of socialism, “basado en los principios humanistas y en las
condiciones éticas Bolivarianas”,

- To undo the capitalist mining model, and substitute it by a new model, and

- The execution of public policies “que se traduzcan en el vivir bien del pueblo,
la proteccién ambiental y el desarrollo nacional”.

States enjoy extensive discretion in establishing their public policy. It is not the role
of investment tribunals to second-guess the appropriateness of the political or
economic model adopted by the legitimate organs of a sovereign State. The
Nationalization Decree clearly states its purpose, and such purpose is a legitimate

aim of economic policy. On its face, the Nationalization Decree complies with the
public purpose requirement of Art. VII.1 of the BIT.

B. Due process

6. Venezuela says that the requirement of due process was complied with, because
Rusoro had the option to pursue judicial or administrative remedies in Venezuela.
For example, Rusoro could have challenged the constitutionality of the
Nationalization Decree — but it failed to do so””!.

7. Rusoro disagrees”°?. In its opinion, Rusoro had no opportunity to claim its
legitimate rights, because the Decree stipulated ab initio that compensation could
only be paid according to book value. Rusoro could not challenge this requirement
before the Venezuelan courts. Indeed the Nationalization Decree provided that”?

“las disposiciones del presente Decreto Ley son de orden ptiblico y se
aplicarén con preferencia a cualquier otra del mismo rango legal”.

The Tribunal’s position
8. The Tribunal sides with Venezuela.

9. The Treaty requires that the nationalization be effected “under due process of law”.
The requirement does not specifically refer to the municipal expropriation law of
Venezuela, but to due process in general, a generic concept to be construed in
accordance with international law. In essence, due process requires

 

 

- (i) that the decision to nationalize be properly adopted, and that

- (ii) the expropriated investor have an opportunity to challenge such decision
before an independent and impartial body?*.

0. (i) In the present case, the Nationalization Decree was adopted as a decree with the
rank of a Ley Organica — an organic law holding the highest authority (after the
Constitution) in the Venezuelan legal hierarchy. After deliberation at the Consejo
de Ministros, the Decree was issued by President Chavez, who had been
empowered by a formal authorization granted by Parliament”. Claimant does not
allege that President Chavez was not duly authorized to pass the Nationalization
Decree, or that the proper formalities of law have not been followed.

 

(ii) Respondent submits that the Claimant had two avenues open to challenge the
decision to nationalize its gold mining operations:

- First, it could have challenged the constitutionality of the Nationalization
Decree, alleging that this Decreto is incompatible with the Venezuelan
Constitution?”,

- Second, additionally or alternatively, Rusoro could have challenged the actos
de ejecucién adopted by the Venezuelan Government in furtherance of the
Nationalization Decree before the Jurisdiccién —_ Contencioso-
Administrativa?”.

Rusoro never pursued any of these options — arguing that any attempt to obtain
justice locally would have been futile”*. Be that
that two judicial recourses were available remains unchallenged, and is s
for “due process of law” to have been complied with.

 
 

3. The Tribunal concludes that Claimant has failed to prove that the Bolivarian

Republic violated due process of law when it decided to nationalize the gold sector
in Venezuela by issuing the Nationalization Decree, which adopted the form of a
“Decreto con rango, valor y fuerza de Ley Organica”.

C.  Non-discrimination

The Bolivarian Republic says that the Nationalization Decree applied to all mining
operators in Venezuela, foreign or domestic without regard to nationality. There is
no evidence that the reasons for nationalizing Rusoro’s assets were related to its
nationality”””.

 

  

Rusoro disagrees: the Nationalization Decree restricted gold exploration and
exploitation to State-owned companies and thus discriminated against Rusoro by
excluding it from the gold sector*™.

The Tribunal again sides with Venezuela.

Venezuelan and foreign investors in the gold sector were equally affected by the
Nationalization Decree. It is true, as Claimant avers, that Venezuela’s State-owned
companies were not negatively affected by the Nationalization Decree*”'. But this
is a necessary consequence of the nationalization of a productive sector in which
privately owned and State-owned companies coexisted. In situations like this,
privately owned enterprises are expropriated, while State-enterprises remain
unaffected. But this difference of treatment cannot be considered to amount to
discrimination.

D. Prompt, adequate and effective compensation

Claimant emphasizes that this requirement has never been complied with.
Venezuela never paid any compensation and the negotiation was a mere window
dressing: the Nationalization Decree limited compensation to the book value of the
investment and Venezuela never offered the “genuine value” of the investment, as
required by the BIT*?.

Venezuela si things differently: it avers that it negotiated in good faith with
Claimant fot months, and that the outcome was that Rusoro did not like the offer
made by the Bolivarian Republic. A disagreement over valuation between a State
and an expropriated private party is not a breach of international law by the State*>.

  

The Tribunal’s position

It is a fact that from October 2011 through March 2012 the Bolivarian Republic and
Rusoro unsuccessfully negotiated a settlement for the expropriation of Rusoro’s
Mining Rights and assets. It is also undisputed that in accordance with the
Nationalization Decree, the maximum amount of compensation which could be
offered by Venezuela was capped at the “valor en libros” of the investment**.
Finally, it is also undisputed that in the four years which have lapsed since the
negotiations broke off, the Bolivarian Republic has not made any payment of
compensation in favour of Rusoro.

The standard required by the BIT is that compensation be “prompt, adequate and
effective”. However, the mere fact that an investor has not received compensation
does not in itself render an expropriation unlawful. An offer of compensation may
have been made to the investor and, in such case, the legality of the expropriation
will depend on the terms of that offer*>.

The precise amount of compensation offered by Venezuela has not been disclosed,
since it is covered by a confidentiality undertaking.

3. However, Ing. Rubén Figuera, the leader of the Venezuelan negotiation team, has

submitted two witness statements, and was then examined in the course of the
Hearing. Ing. Figuera has explained in some detail the reasoning underlying
Venezuela’s offer:

- Venezuela’s preferred solution had been the creation of a Mixed Company,

compensation being a subsidiary alternative offered to the investor*®;

ion on

 

- Venezuela’s initial intention had been to base its offer for compens:
the consolidated net worth of Rusoro’s Venezuelan subsidiaries*”’;

- In the course of the due diligence procedure, the legal advisors to the State
concluded that Rusoro had illegally acquired title to the Mining Rights, since
it had bought controlling shareholdings in the Venezuelan companies holding
such rights, without obtaining authorization from the Venezuelan
authorities*°;

- Consequently, it was decided that Venezuela should only offer a reduced
compensation to Rusoro: (i) there should be no compensation for un-mined
gold deposits, since the investor lacked valid title to such gold”; and (ii)
compensation should be limited to the non-depreciated value of fixed assets
plus investments in explorations that had yielded positive results*"° (provided
that such explorations had been carried out in areas where Rusoro held valid
exploration rights*!');

- In any case, the Nationalization Decree made it legally impossible for
Venezuela to offer a compensation which exceeded the book value of the
expropriated investment, even if fair market value were to exceed book

value!?,

Standards of compe! ion

The standard for compensation under Art. VIL.1 of the BIT requires that the amount
paid must represent the “genuine value of the investment or returns”; and this
“genuine value” equates with fair market value*!*. An analogous standard is also
required by Venezuela’s domestic law on expropriation (“valor equivalente que
corresponda al bien expropiado”)*!*.

The Nationalization Decree however established a different standard — “valor en
libros”, which, in the interpretation given by Ing. Figuera, equates with the net
worth of the expropriated companies. Ing. Figueras also confirmed that even if the
fair market value of the investment were to exceed the “valor en libros”, the
Nationalization Decree precluded an offer beyond that threshold.

 

Venezuela’s o!

In reality, however, Venezuela’s offer did not even reach the cap provided for in
the Nationalization Decree. As Ing. Figueras deposed, the offer was reduced to the
non-depreciated value of the fixed assets plus the investment in certain
explorations, based on the argument that Rusoro had illegally acquired its Mining
Rights by ing to obtain requisite administrative authorizations. The Tribunal has
already analysed this argument, and has concluded that Rusoro’s acquisitions of
Venezuelan companies holding mining rights did not require administrative
authorization under Art. 29 of the Mining Law and that the Venezuelan government

at the relevant time was perfectly aware of the acquisitions and never raised any
concern*!>,

The legality of an expropriation where the State has taken the investment but has
failed to make any compensation payment, depends on whether a good faith offer
for a reasonable amount of compensation was actually made.

In the present case, the Nationalization Decree provided for the payment of
compensation to investors in the gold sector, but established a cap, which was not
foreseen either in the BIT or in domestic Venezuelan law. The Bolivarian Republic
then submitted an offer, for an amount which was significantly below the cap
established by the Decree. The reason for this reduction was the alleged illegality
of Rusoro’s investment — an argument which has been analysed and dismissed by
the Tribunal?!°. Furthermore, the amount offered was never actually paid to, nor
deposited in escrow in favour of Claimant.

 

 

Given these circumstances the Tribunal concludes that the Bolivarian Republic has
not met the requirement established in Art. VII.1. of the BIT, to the effect that
expropriations or nationalizations may only be decreed “against prompt, adequate
and effective compensation”.

 

Summing up, the Tribunal concludes that the Bolivarian Republic has complied
with three of the four requirements established in Art. VII.1 of the Treaty, but that
it has failed to comply with the fourth, “prompt, adequate and effective

compensation”:

CREEPING EXPROPRIATION

 

Claimant submits that it suffered not only a direct expropriation of its as
that it was also the subject of a creeping expropriation. Starting in April 2009,
Venezuela allegedly enacted a series of interconnected measures targeting Rusoro’s
gold mining business, which culminated in the outright nationalization of Rusoro’s
investment through the Nationalization Decree.

The Bolivarian Republic denies that, before the enactment of the Nationalization
Decree, it had developed or was following any plan with the aim of taking
Claimant’s investments. All pre-2011 actions were unconnected, did not form part
of a wider plan to nationalize Rusoro’s assets and represented distinct policy
decisions, based upon different and legitimate reasons, taken by various
government entities in the exercise of their legitimate right to issue regulation in the
public interest.

. To adjudicate this issue, the Tribunal will establish the proven facts (A.), and then

will decide whether there is evidence that in 2009 Venezuela had developed the

See para, 341 et seq supra.

316 See para. 341 et seq supra.

98

plan to nationalize Claimant’s gold assets and whether the 2009 Measures formed
part of that plan (B.).

A. Proven facts

414. Venezuela submits?!’ that since 2005 its approved and publicly announced
government policy was to replicate in the gold sector the policy adopted in the oil
sector: to convert all private mining activities to mixed enterprises, and of
expropriating holders of substantial mining rights who resisted the change.

415. There is some evidence showing that that since 2005/6 the Venezuelan government
was at least envisioning the possibility that in a medium to long term time horizon
it would nationalize the gold and diamond mining sectors:

- in 2005 President Chavez approved an internal policy paper, which implied
that in a time horizon of between five and 10 years the State would assume
control of the gold (and diamond) mining activities, and

- in 2006 the then “Ministro de Industrias Basicas”, Sr. Victor Alva eZ,
published an article in the Internet*!® in which he set forth the “Principios
rectores de la nueva politica minera venezolana’”, the first principle being the
suppression of all mining concessions granted to private persons, and the
incorporation of mixed enterprises to carry out mining activities and the
second principle the abolition of “mining latifundia”, including those owned
by “private groups from Russia”.

 

 
  

416. Grupo Agapov had started its acquisitions of mining assets in Venezuela in 2002,
and continued doing so through 2005. In 2006 Grupo Agapov merged into Rusoro,
and Rusoro purchased additional assets in the period 2006-2008. There is no
evidence that the approval of the 2005 policy paper by President Chavez was made
publicly known, nor that Rusoro became aware of the article published by the
Minister in 2006 in Aporrea (which defines itself as a “portal alternativo de noticias
a favor del gobierno de Hugo Chavez”).

Regulation of the gold market

417. At the time when Grupo Agapov/Rusoro made their investments, the BCV was
already entrusted with the regulation of the Venezuelan gold sector. It had issued a
specific Resolution — the 1996 BCV Resolution — limiting the export of gold: at
least 15% of the total production could not be exported and had to be sold in the
private domestic market.

418. That Resolution was in force when Rusoro bought its assets and continued in force
until April 2009, when a new Resolution — the April 2009 BCV Resolution - was

approved, which introduced further limitations:

- sales in the domestic market were limited to 10% of production,

424.

- exports to 30% and

- 60% of the production had to be sold to the BCV, at a price in VEF calculated
by converting the international gold price at the Official Exchange Rate.

In June 2009 a new Resolution was enacted — the June 2009 BCV Resolution —
which reaffirmed the regime created by the April 2009 BCV Resolution for the
private sector, but relaxed the rules for the public gold producing sector: in
companies controlled by the State

- Sales in the domestic market were raised to up to 25%,
- The percentage which could be exported was raised to 50%,
- And the share which had to be offered to the BCV was reduced to 25%.

The June 2009 BCV and its striking differentiation between public and private gold
producers remained in force for approximately one year and was then replaced by
the July 2010 BCV Resolution, which again created a unified regime for public and
private producers:

- 50% of production had to be sold to the BCV, at a price expressed in VEF
and converted at the Official Exchange Rate,

- the remaining 50% could be exported.

The July 2010 BCV Resolution was still in force when the Nationalization Decree
was issued on 23 August 2011.

General exchange control rules

In 2003 — before the incorporation of Rusoro in 2006 — the Government of
Venezuela and the BCV issued Convenio Cambiario No. 1, a rule which created a
strict exchange control regime, with a public agency, CADIVI, to supervise and
manage the system and to grant the requisite authorizations.

. In accordance with Convenio Cambiario No. 1, a private company operating in

Venezuela was obliged to sell its foreign currency to the BCV at the Official
Exchange Rate (except for a 10% tranche, which could be used to pay related
expenses in foreign currency), and could only purchase the foreign currency
required for its import and other activities with prior authorization of CADIVI.

The impact of this severe exchange control regime was softened due to the existence
of the Swap Market, a parallel currency market where Venezuelan individuals and
corporations could exchange VEF against USD (and vice-versa), at a market rate
(which was consistently higher than the Official Exchange Rate), by buying and
selling securities. In May 2010 the Government passed the Ley de Reforma
Cambiaria making the use of the Swap Market illegal?!

319 See para. 154 supra.

100

Specific exchange control rules for the gold sector

425. After the enactment of Convenio Cambiario No. 1, gold producing companies were
subject to the normal statutory exchange control regime. That situation however
changed in June 2009, when Convenio Caml No. 12 was published, a specific
exchange control rule for the gold sector. Private companies were now obliged to
repatriate all foreign currency earning obtained from gold exports and sell the
foreign currency to the BCV at the Official Exchange Rate. This rule, however, did
not apply to state-owned companies, which were exempted from the repatriation
rule and authorized to maintain foreign currency in bank accounts located abroad,
and to freely use such funds*°.

 

426. This rule, which favored State-controlled gold producing companies, was repealed
in July 2010, when Convenio Cambiario No. 12 was amended. Thereafter the
regulation applicable to private and to public gold producers was unified: all gold
producers were now required to sell to the BCV at the Official Exchange Rate 50%
of their foreign currency income from export operations, while the other 50% was
exempted from repatriation and could be held in foreign accounts and used outside
Venezuela™!.

B. No evidence of creeping expropriation

427. Rusoro’s contention regarding creeping expropriation is two-pronged: (i) since
2005/2006 Venezuela had a plan to nationalize the gold mining sector, and (ii) this
plan was then carried out in three interconnected steps:

- in 2009, when Venezuela adopted the 2009 Measures (i.e. the April 2009
BCV Resolution, the June 2009 BCV Resolution and the Convenio
Cambiario No. 12),

- in 2010, when the Ley de Reforma Cambiaria and the 2010 Measures were
issued (i.e. the July 2010 BCV Resolution and the Amendment to the
Convenio Cambiario No. 12), and finally

- in 2011 when the Nationalization Decree was approved.
Time bar

428. The Tribunal has already found*” that in accordance with Art. XII.3 (d) of the BIT
any breach allegedly committed by Venezuela when it adopted the 2009 Measures
has become time barred and cannot result in an enforceable claim. This decision
implies that the 2009 Measures cannot be taken into consideration in order to decide
whether a creeping expropriation has occurred.

429. As noted in the jurisdictional findings, however, this conclusion does not imply that
the 2009 Measures have become totally irrelevant for the Tribunal’s decision,

providing background and context for the Tribunal’s adjudication, even if by
themselves they cannot amount to a breach of the Treaty.

 

The Tribunal’s position

Rusoro’s argument that it suffered a creeping expropriation is premised on two
factual assumptions:

- (i) that Venezuela had developed a plan to nationalize the gold sector, and
- (ii) that such plan was implemented through three interconnected steps.

(i) There is some evidence in the file which supports the first assumption. There are
indications that since 2005/2006 the Bolivarian Republic may have been
envisioning a high level policy for the gold and diamond mining sector, which in a
five to 10 years horizon would lead to a reform similar to that accomplished in the
oil and gas sector: all existing mining concessions and contracts held by “mining
latifundia” would be converted into mixed enterprises, controlled by the State,
while private investors unwilling to accept the change would be expropriated.

 

 

(ii) The problem with Rusoro’s allegation is that the second factual assumption is
unproven. There is no convincing evidence that before the adoption of the 2011
Nationalization Decree Venezuela had decided to implement the high level policy
of nationalization of the gold sector envisioned since 2005/6, in spite of the political
inspiration of both sets of measures.

Analy: f the al le evidence

. The 2009 Measures is the first set of measures which, in Rusoro’s submission,

resulted in a creeping expropriation. The 2009 Measures mandated private gold
producers to sell 60% of their production to the BCV at a reduced price, limited
exports to 30% and ordered repatriation of all proceeds; the result was that
Venezuela’s reserves were bolstered and that the BCV could replenish its holdings
of gold at a favourable price — as admitted in a public interview by the President of
the BCV, who explained that the BCV was able to buy gold at 900 USD/oz. using
the Official Exchange rate and then resell it in the international market for 1,700
USD/oz.>?>.

These measures were adopted by the BCV — not by the Ministry of Mining — and
their primary purpose clearly was to increase the BCV’s currency and gold reserves,
depleted due to the international financial crisis and the reduction of the oil exports
— not to take control of the gold sector.

 

There is a further argument: the 2009 Measures were only in force for
approximately one year, and were repealed by the 2010 Measures, which implied a
partial re-liberalization of the gold market: the 60% obligatory sale percentage to

5°3 The interview in “El Universal” was published in 2012, but the conclusions also apply to the situation
in 2010.

438.

439.

the BCV was reduced to 50%, the export quota was raised from 30% to 50% and
the obligation to repatriate funds was lowered from 100% to 50%.

The adoption of the 2010 Measures, an attempt to undo some of the most stringent
effects of the 2009 Measures, incompatible with Claimant’s allegation that
Venezuela was following a well-defined plan to nationalize the gold sector by
successive, interconnected actions. If such plan had existed, the 2010 Measures
should have increased, not decreased, the burden on private gold producers. The
fact that the 2010 Measures in fact relaxed the regime, proves that Venezuela was
not following a hidden agenda to nationalize the private gold sector.

 

 

 

There is a final argument: if the Venezuelan State had had the intention of
nationalizing the gold sector in 2009 or in 2010, there was no need at all to use the
powers of the BCV as an instrument to advance the policy. In 2011 President
Chavez and his Consejo de Ministros nationalized the gold sector using the powers
vested by Parliament, by simply issuing a Decree with “rango, valor y fuerza de
Ley Organica”. If the government had wanted to nationalize the gold sector in 2009
or 2010, it could easily have followed the same path, without involving the BCV.

In conclusion the contention that Venezuela incurred in a creeping expropriation of

the gold sector beginning with the 2009 Measures, in breach of Art. VII.1 of the
Treaty, must be dismissed.

VIL3. ANCILLARY CLAIMS

Rusoro has also filed several Ancillary Claims, submitting that

- Venezuela failed to accord Rusoro’s investment fair and equitable treatment
[“FET”] and

- full protection and security [“FPS”],
- that Venezuela discriminated against Rusoro and its investments,
- that Venezuela impeded the free transfer of Rusoro’s funds and

- that Venezuela imposed an illegal export ban on gold.

. The Tribunal will summarize Claimant’s and Respondent’s position with regard to

the Ancillary Claims (1. and 2.) and will then reach its own opinion (3.).

CLAIMANT’S POSITION

. Claimant says that the Bolivarian Republic breached the FET standard, failed to

provide FPS, incurred in discrimination, impeded the free transfer of funds and
imposed an illegal export ban on gold.

. The FET standard speci:

. When Rusoro invested in Venezuela, it was pi

A. FET

. Claimant submits that Art. II.2 of the Treaty does not require a heightened threshold

corresponding to an alleged customary international minimum standard for the
treatment of aliens for a violation of the FET standard to occur**. Alternatively,
Rusoro pleads application of the most favoured nation [“MFN”] clause contained
in Art. III of the BIT, and the application of Belarus-Venezuela Treaty, which
provides for an FET standard without any restriction”.

3. Rusoro submits that Venezuela breached the FET standard by imposing a series of

conflicting, unpredictable and ever-changing regulations between 2009 and
2011576,

 

cally requires states to maintain a stable investment
environment in accordance with the investor’s legitimate expectations. If an
investor makes important capital contributions and takes on significant financial
obligations in reliance on the legal and regulatory environment in place at the time
of the investment, it is fair and equitable that those key rules are respected and that
they are not unilaterally abrogated by the State*?’. Investors are entitled to expect
that they will enjoy a stable and predictable legal framework for their investments,
and the FET standard protects that expectation®?*. In this case, there were
government actions which created a legitimate expectation that the investment
environment would not be fundamentally altered”?

 

 

 

ible to sell gold freely and foreign
currency was available without significant limitations through the Swap Market**°.

. The 2009 Measures fundamentally altered the economic foundation of Rusoro’s

business. From April 2009 it was forced to sell more than half of its production to
the BCV at a greatly reduced price. From July 2010 the private domestic market
was totally closed. In June 2009 Rusoro’s ability to obtain foreign currency derived
from gold exports was eliminated**!, Venezuela also implemented more favourable
conditions for its own gold producers, while it continued to extract a heavy toll from
private companies like Rusoro’ sidiaries. The restrictions were designed to shift
gold and hard currency from private to public hands, so that applying them to State-

owned companies would have been counterproductive**.

 
 

. The elimination of the Swap Market in 2010 was also unfair and inequitable,

 

because it denied Rusoro the foreign currency needed for its business**’. Between
2003 and 2010 the Swap Market was the only lawful and effective way for Rusoro

to obtain foreign currency**, SITME, the system that replaced it, was non-
transparent, incompetent and wholly inadequate**. As a result Rusoro’s cash flow
was crippled**°,

 

 

  

448. Venezuela also failed to treat Rusoro’s investment with transparency and under due
process, because each of the 2009 and 2010 Measures was executed without
warning**’ and Rusoro never had a realistic opportunity to review the measures or
their application or have them reviewed by an impartial person**’.

449. Venezuela’s measures were also arbitrary, because the 2009 and 2010 Measures
were allegedly designed to combat illegal gold trade, but in fact Rusoro had no
opportunity to illegally sell gold**°. There is no evidence of illegal and law-evading
activity in the gold sector, and Venezuela’s explanation is a post hoc pretext™°.

B. EPS

450. The FPS imposes an obligation of due diligence and vigilance on the host State™!,
which is not limited to physical protection*?. Venezuela failed to ensure FPS to
Rusoro’s investment by adopting the 2009 and 2010 Measures, by shutting-down
the Swap Market in 2010 and by denying Rusoro access to foreign currency in the
post-nationalization phase**.

451. Even if the Treaty were found to guarantee only physical security, Rusoro would
still benefit from FPS (pursuant to the Treaty’s MFN clause, because Venezuela
guaranteed “full protection and legal security” to third-State nationals under the
Uruguay-Venezuela BIT**.

C. Discrimination

investments by creating more favourable rules for Venezuelan State-owned
producers operating in the gold sector than those it applied to foreign producers*4°
and by promoting small-scale private producers against Rusoro, the only large scale
private producer*7.

D. Free transfer of funds

. Rusoro says that Art. VIII of the BIT is an objective and absolute guarantee of the

free transfer of investments and returns, irrespective of whether exchange
restrictions were already in place when the investment was made*4®. Convenio
Cambiario No. | expressly stated that Venezuela’s international commitments
would prevail.

The 2009 Measures effectively imprisoned Rusoro’s returns in Venezuela, forcing
Rusoro to repatriate to Venezuela the totality of the proceeds from each export sale,
for conversion at the BCV, at an exchange rate that artificially boosted the value of
the VEF*.

Furthermore, the 2009 and 2010 Measures compelled Rusoro to sell most of its gold
to the BCV in Venezuela. Since gold falls within the definition of “returns”, Rusoro
argues that this also represented a breach of the BIT**°.

Further breaches of the Treaty were the abolition of the Swap Market in 2010, and
the obligation to sell the foreign currency obtained from the gold exports at the
distorted Official Exchange Rate**!. The BIT guarantees a market-based exchange
rate. If necessary, Art. 7 of the Denmark-Venezuela BIT, which refers to the
“prevailing market rate at the date of transfer” could be applied pursuant to the
Treaty’s most-favoured nation treatment clause (Art. III.1)**?.

Finally, the abolition of the Swap Market and the deficiencies of the SITME scheme
cut off Rusoro’s access to foreign currency and the export restrictions on gold also
violated paragraph 6 of the Annex of the Treaty**>.

RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Bolivarian Republic rejects Rusoro’s Ancillary Claims (B. through E.). But
before doing so, it submits two preliminary defences (A.)

A. Preliminary defences

The Bolivarian Republic submits two preliminary defences: that Rusoro had no
legal standing because its hands are dirty (i) and that the general exemption
established in Art. X of the BIT, carving out prudential regulation, is applicable to
the Ancillary Claims.

(i) The Republic argues that Rusoro may not seek relief for regulations adopted by
Venezuela that prevented Rusoro’s illegal conduct***. The 2009 M
justified response to the growth of illegal exports of gold. Rusoro’s hands are dirty

because it engaged in illegal conduct and in some instances its illegal conduct
contributed substantially and directly to the conditions that led Venezuela to adopt
the regulations about which Rusoro complains*>>.

1. Since Venezuela’s domestic market was too small to absorb Venezuela’s
production, it is clear that Rusoro’s alleged buyers were exporting illegally. By
adopting the 2009 Measures the BCV intended to put an end to illegal exports and
exert more control over the mining industry*°.

Art. X of the Treaty
2. (ii) As a general defence Venezuela argues that Art. X of the BIT governs the 2009

and 2010 Measures and carves out regulatory space for governments to enact
policies for prudential reasons*°’. Regulation of the gold market is an essential
control instrument of a country’s monetary and financial policy. The 2009 and 2010
Measures and the closure of the Swap Market were adopted to prevent threats to
the “integrity and stability” of Venezuela’s “financial system”?>*.

 

B. FET

3. Respondent says that the language of Art. II.2 of the Treaty explicitly qualifies the
FET standard by reference to “the principles of international law”*°’, which is
practically identical to the language of Art. 1105(1) of NAFTA*®® and equates with
the customary international minimum standard. The parties to the BIT have
specifically interpreted the relevant FET language as incorporating the minimum
standard, and Art. XII.7 of the BIT states that an interpretation to which both parties
have agreed shall be binding upon the Tribunal**!. And this standard is only violated
in cases of extreme government conduct like gross denial of justice, manifest
arbitrariness, blatant unfairness or complete lack of due process**.

4. Venezuela adds that Claimant’s attempt to incorporate the FET clause contained in
the Venezuela-Belarus bilateral treaty, by way of the MFN clause contained in the
Canada-Venezuela BIT, should be rejected, because the requirements established
in Art. III of the BIT have not been met*

5. There can be no legitimate expectations of legal stability where Claimant had failed
to obtain a stabilization agreement required under Venezuelan law and Venezuela
had made no specific promises or commitments*™. In these cases there is no

legitimate expectation that the legal regime affecting the investment is
immutable*.

Venezuela says that the modification of its regulatory regime for gold marketing
was a legitimate regulatory action in response to significant changes in the market,
including an increase in illegal activity. Gold producers were selling gold to small
domestic purchasers in an abusive manner*®. The 2009 Measures simply
eliminated this avenue of abuse*’. Venezuela does not need to prove that Rusoro
was participating in an illegal market. What matters is that the new regulation
reacted to evidence of illegal activity and was a legitimate exercise of regulatory
authority>®,

Respondent explains that the abolition of the Swap Market was a legitimate exercise
of Venezuela’s authority to enforce its laws. The Swap Market was an unregulated
grey market created by private traders based on a loophole in the law and was used
to evade clearly established exchange control laws. Although the Swap Market was
tolerated by the Government from 2003 through 2010, its legality was always
dubious*®. The closure of the Swap Market was a legitimate step to combat massive
evasion of laws*”°. A foreign investor has no inherent right to require that a
government tolerate an informal practice based on a loophole in a legal regime*”!.
Moreover, investors had access to three different mechanisms for acquiring foreign
currency: CADIVI, SITME and after the 2010 Measures exports of gold*””.

 

The Bolivarian Republic says that the modification of its regulatory regime of gold
marketing and the abolition of the Swap Market were consistent with Venezuelan
Law, well reasoned and based on the need to address an increase in illegal
activities*”>, Even if an autonomous FET standard were to be applied, Venezuela
has not breached the BIT, because there has been no failure to protect legitimate
expectations, no failure to adhere to transparency and due process and no arbitrary
or bad faith behaviour’.

Cc. EPS

Respondent avers that Claimant is not alleging that its property or personnel were
in any way subject to or threatened with harm. Under the applicable legal standard
of FPS, Rusoro’s claim for a violation of the BIT is frivolous*”5. Furthermore Art.
1.2 of the BIT prescribes the minimum standard of FPS under customary

international law*’°, and this standard only protects persons and property from

physical harm — and no physical harm is being alleged by Claimant*”’.

The Bolivarian Republic adds that Claimant’s effort to import the FPS standard
contained in Art. 4 of the Uruguay-Venezuela BIT through the Treaty’s most
favoured nation clause should be disregarded, because Claimant has failed to prove
the conditions required by Art. III of the BIT for the application of the MFN clause:
that Venezuela accorded Claimant’s investments “treatment” that “in like
circumstances” was “less favourable” than the treatment accorded to Uruguayan
investments*”’, Furthermore, the mere invocation of the MFN clause cannot
override specifically-negotiated provisions that the parties envisaged as
fundamental conditions for their acceptance of the BIT. This includes any
specifically negotiated limitations on the content of the FPS standard, like the

adherence to the minimum standard of treatment®”.

 

In any case, the Bolivarian Republic argues that it did not fail to provide FPS under
any standard*®°, Even if FPS is extended beyond physical harm, there was nothing
unlawful in the manner in which Venezuela amended its regulation*®!. Rusoro has
failed to establish any wrongful conduct by Venezuela. Its vague allegations of
regulatory delays are not sufficient to meet its burden of proof**?.

D. Discrimination

Venezuela denies having discriminated against Rusoro and its investments, since

 

nothing discriminatory in the 2009 Measures, and the special benefits granted to
State-controlled companies should have been no surprise to Rusoro, since Rusoro
knew that the mining policy was to encourage the creation of mixed companies.
Venezuela had a sovereign right to foster the implementation of these widely-
announced mining policies***, Furthermore, Rusoro cannot legitimately argue
discriminatory treatment based on a provision aimed at setting rules for small
mining activity that are not applicable to the large scale miners, whether public or
private*®>, In any case, the alleged discrimination against Rusoro — which
Venezuela denies — certainly ceased with the adoption of the 2010 Measures**°.

E. Free transfer of funds

. The Bolivarian Republic says that Art. VIII of the Treaty does not prohibit a Party

from establishing exchange control measures**’. A restriction on the transfer of
funds is not a violation of the Treaty, since customary international law recognizes
the concept of “monetary sovereignty”, according to which a State has the exclusive
right to determine its monetary unit, to fix and to regulate the exchange rate and to
regulate, prohibit or restrict the conversion and transfer of foreign exchange***. Art.
X of the Treaty expressly incorporates the principle that the exercise of monetary
sovereignty is legitimate and takes precedence over any provision of the Treaty

 

In fact Venezuela’s exchange control regime was established in 1996, before
Claimant acquired any ts in Venezuela. The laws were modified in 2003
creating an integrally controlled exchange market*®®. Among the risks disclosed by
Rusoro in 2006 to its investors was the risk of exchange control restrictions in
Venezuela*”. Claimant cannot now complain about alleged breaches based on laws
and regulations already in place when it invested*?!.

 

While the 2009 Measures were in place, Claimant could obtain foreign currency
through the CADIVI mechanism*”. Upon enactment of the 2010 Measures,
Claimant was allowed to keep accounts overseas, directly export 25% of its gold
and keep the foreign currency proceeds in such accounts. There was no
“{mprisonment”**’. The regime which resulted from the 2009 and 2010 Measures
was consistent with the Treaty: Rusoro had at all times available mechanisms to
obtain dollars for repatriation of capital>™.

Venezuela denies that the gold produced by Rusoro can be considered for purposes
of the BIT as “returns”. Claimant’s gold is no more a return than is a car produced
by a foreign investor in its car factory in Venezuela. Gold is a commodity, not a
currency. It can only become a currency if it is minted and becomes legal tender by
government*”’. Therefore Venezuela did not breach its obligation to guarantee the
unrestricted transfer of investments and returns by requiring gold producers to
allocate part of their production to the domestic market*”°.

The Bolivarian Republic adds that it has not manipulated its exchange rate: the
applicable exchange rate is the Official Exchange Rate established by the BCV, as
it is in all countries around the world with exchange controls**’. The BIT does not
guarantee the transfer at a market rate of exchange. Claimant’s attempt to import

the transfer of funds provision contained in the Denmark-Venezuela BIT must be
disregarded for the same reasons submitted when dealing with the FPS standard***.

As regards Claimant’s argument based on para. 6 of the Annex of the Treaty, the
regime for gold marketing in place in 2003 required repatriation of 90% of all
foreign currency from exports of gold. This is equivalent to the requirement
established by the 2009 and 2010 Measures to sell to the BCV. These Measures did
not change Rusoro’s financial situation and did not cause any harm*%’.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

The Tribunal must now decide whether there is merit in any of the Ancillary Claims
submitted by Rusoro. In order to do so, the Tribunal will summarize the proven
facts (3.1.), and will then establish whether the Bolivarian Republic breached the
principles of FET (3.3.), FPS (3.4.) or free transfer of funds (3.6.), or subjected
Rusoro’s investment to a discriminatory treatment (3.5.).

Before doing so, it is necessary to briefly address two preliminary arguments
submitted by the Bolivarian Republic (3.2.).

PROVEN FACTS

The Tribunal has already found that in accordance with Art. XII.3 (d) of the BIT
any breach allegedly committed by Venezuela when it adopted the 2009 Measures
has become time barred (although the 2009 Measures may still provide background
and context for the Tribunal’s decision) *.

This implies that only two sets of facts remain which allegedly could have resulted
in ancillary breaches of the BIT: the closure of the Swap Market (A.) and the 2010
Measures, i.e. the July 2010 BCV Resolution and the Amendment to the Convenio
Cambiario No. 12 (B.).

A. Closure of the Swap Market

. In 2003 Convenio Cambiario No. | was enacted; it created an exchange control

system, forcing private companies operating in Venezuela to sell foreign currency
to the BCV at the Official Exchange Rate, and to purchase foreign currency through
CADIVI and subject to CADIVI’s discretionary authorization.

Apart from this official market, a parallel market, not expressly provided for in the
exchange control legislation, but tolerated by the authorities, existed“°!. Through
this Swap Market private companies had the possibility of buying and selling

4°! As additions to their PHB’s, both Parties submitted Briefs on the Swap Market [C PHB/SM and
R PHB/SM]; in its R PHB/SM the Republic acknowledges that the swap market was unregulated and of
dubious legality — but not that before 2010 it was illegal (at 4). In Venezuela’s submission, the only illegal
behaviour was that of certain stock-brokers, who used the same government securities repeatedly to carry
out successive swap transactions (at 8).

foreign currency against VEF, at a market exchange rate which was consistently
higher than the Official Exchange Rate.

This dual system came to a halt on 17 May 2010, when the Ley Cambiaria was
amended, making the use of the Swap Market illegal*.

B. The 2010 Measures

In July 2010 the BCV*? amended the 2009 Measures, liberalized the gold sale
regime and reduced the distinction between publicly and privately owned gold
producers.

The purpose of the July 2010 BCV Resolution*™ was to regulate the sale of gold
by public and private producers operating in Venezuela. It created a unified regime
for public and private producers:

- 50% of production had to be sold to the BCV, at a price expressed in VEF
and converted at the Official Exchange Rate; and

- the remaining 50% could be exported, subject to authorization from the BCV.

Simultaneously the Convenio Cambiario No. 12 (originally issued in 2009) was
amended, partially liberalizing the exchange control regime of gold producers, and
unifying the different regimes applicable to private and to public gold producers
(except small scale producers). All gold producers were now required to sell 50%
of their foreign currency income from export operations to the BCV at the Official
Exchange Rate, and were authorized to keep the other 50% in foreign accounts and
to use the funds for payments in foreign currency outside the Bolivarian
Republic*.

  

PRELIMINARY DEFENCES

Venezuela has filed two preliminary defences: that Rusoro’s hands are dirty (A.)
and that the exception benefitting prudential regulation, provided for in Art. X of
the BIT, is to be applied (B.).

Both defences are without merit.

A. Dirty hands

The Republic argues that Rusoro may not seek relief for regulations adopted by
Venezuela to prevent Rusoro’s illegal sales to domestic buyers, in order to permit
buyers to illegally export gold from Venezuela (i), and that the purpose of the 2009
and 2010 Measures was to curb such illicit transactions (ii).

(i) The problem with Venezuela’s first contention is not the principle (it is
undisputed that claimants with “dirty hands” have no standing in investment
arbitration’), but the total lack of evidence.

. Venezuela submits that Rusoro knowingly furthered the illegal export of gold

- By selling to domestic clients, certified by the Ministry of Mines, but not
included in the BCV’s list of registered gold exporters*”’,

- And by incorrectly making out waybills in favour of a security transport
company (and not the final buyer of the gold)*°8.

In accordance with Art. 88 Mining Law the Ministry of Mines is entrusted with the
following duties with regard to mining activities and companies:

“El Ejecutivo Nacional, por 6rgano del Ministerio de Energia y Minas,
vigilard, fiscalizara y controlard las actividades de toda persona natural 0
juridica, ptiblica o privada, en las materias sometidas a las disposiciones de
esta Ley [...]”.

The Ministry is also empowered to impose sanctions on persons who breach the
mining regulations’.

 

 

Using the powers conferred by law, the Ministry of Mines supervised (or should
have supervised) the activities carried out by Rusoro, Venezuela’s largest private
gold producer. There is no evidence in the file that, as a consequence of such
supervisory activities, the Ministry ever challenged the legality of Rusoro’s
conduct, filed a complaint against Rusoro or imposed any sanction. The Bolivarian
Republic is now raising, for the first time and ex post facto, previously unidentified
violations of its own laws to challenge Rusoro’s claim.

To prove this allegation, the Republic is not marshalling any direct evidence, but
only what Respondent itself defines as “indirect evidence”. The Republic avers
that this evidence “demonstrates that Rusoro systematically evaded mining
regulations that required it to document with specificity each and every gold
transaction’™4"!,

The Tribunal is unconvinced.
If Rusoro’s conduct had indeed been as egregiously illicit as now claimed, the
Ministry of Mines must have been aware of the situation and must have adopted the

corresponding measures. However, there is no evidence that this actually took
place. In the Tribunal’s opinion, the “indirect evidence” marshalled by the

Bolivarian Republic is blatantly insufficient to prove Venezuela’s allegation, that
Rusoro knowingly colluded with domestic purchasers to foster illicit gold exports.

(ii) The second leg of Rusoro’s contention is that the 2009 and 2010 Measures were
adopted to combat illegal exports.

 
 
 

Again, the evidentiary underpinning of this allegation is inexistent: the Meas
themselves fail to state (in their preambles or otherwise) that their purpose was
combat illegal gold exports; and the Republic has not drawn the Tribunal’s attention
to any contemporary memorandum, report or public statement confirming the
Republic’s averment.

 

The very content of the 2009 and 2010 Measures disproves the Republic’s
contention: If Venezuela’s true aim had been to limit illegal exports, the natural
course of action would have been to reinforce the supervisory capacity of the
Ministry of Mines and of the BCV, to intensify reporting requirements and to
increase sanctions for improper behaviour. None of these measures was adopted.
The fundamental innovation introduced by the 2009 and 2010 Measures was to put
producers under a compulsory obligation to sell a percentage of their production to
the BCV, at a price in VEF converted at the Official Exchange Rate — a measure
which permitted the BCV to increase its holdings of gold paying a price which was
lower than the price which would have accrued if the market exchange rate had
been applied.

 

B. Art. X of the BIT
Art. X of the BIT provides as follows:
“Investment in Financial Services
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Contracting Party
from adopting or maintaining reasonable measures for prudential reasons,
such as:
(a) The protection of investors, depositors, financial market participants,
policy-holders, policy-claimants, or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is
owed by a financial institution;

(b) The maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial
responsibility of financial institutions; and

(c) Ensuring the integrity and stability of a Contracting Party’s financial
system”.

Art. XII(13) adds the following possibility:

“Where and investor submits a claim to arbitration and the disputing
Contracting Party alleges as a defense that the measure in question is

a reasonable measure for prudential reasons of the kind referred to in
Article X, or

114

504.

505.

506.

507.

509.

a measure to limit or prevent transfers by a financial institution under
paragraph 6 of Article VIII.

the tribunal, at the request of such Contracting Party, shall request both
Contracting Parties to submit a joint report in writing as to whether the defense
is a valid one in that particular case. The Contracting Parties shall consult
through their financial services authorities on the matter”.

The Tribunal notes that the Bolivarian Republic, although it is alleging a defense
based on Art. X, has not requested that both Contracting Parties submit the joint
report provided for in Art. XII.13 of the BIT. Absent such request, the Tribunal may
proceed to decide the matter.

Venezuela argues that Art. X of the BIT affords governments regulatory space to
enact policies for prudential reasons*!?, and that, when it issued the 2009 and 2010
Measures regulating the gold market and tightened the exchange control regime by
closing the Swap Market, such measures were part of its monetary and financial
policy and prevented threats to the “integrity and stability” of its “financial
system’”4!3,

The Bolivarian Republic’s allegation is incompatible with the plain text of Art. X
of the BIT.

Art. X permits Canada and Venezuela to “[adopt] or [maintain] reasonable
measures for prudential reasons” and then provides an open list of examples,
including the solvency of financial institutions, the protection of financial clients
and the integrity of the financial system.

 

The very language of the rule shows that its scope is limited to prudential measures
adopted in order to protect the financial sector and its institutions, i.e. banking,
insurance and securities. The regulation of the gold mining sector and the general
exchange control regime fall outside the carve out permitted by Art. X. This
conclusion, which derives from a literal interpretation of the rule, is confirmed by
its title (“Investment in Financial Services”), which reinforces the conclusion that
the provision is directed exclusively at investments in the financial sector.

Rusoro was a gold mining company, that owned and exploited its Mining Rights in
Venezuela, produced gold and sold it to industrial clients (and — when forced by the
regulation — to the BCV). Rusoro has never been a bank, an insurance company, a
broker or any other type of financial institution. And Venezuela has failed to
establish that the offending measures were necessary to reinforce Rusoro’s
solvency, to protect the purchasers of gold or to safeguard Venezuela’s financial
system. There is no indication that the purpose of the 2009 or 2010 Measures and
of the closure of the Swap Market was in any way related to the adoption of
“reasonable measures for prudential reasons” in the Venezuelan financial system,
as required by Art. X of the BIT.

FET
Art. IL.2 of the BIT reads as follows:

“Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the principles of
international law, accord investments or returns of investors of the other
Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment and full protection and
security”.

Rusoro says that Venezuela breached the FET standard guaranteed in the BIT, by
adopting the 2009 and 2010 Measures and eliminating the Swap Market. These
Measures were adopted without regard to due process, were arbitrary and destroyed
Rusoro’s legitimate expectations of a stable investment environment, limited its
right to freely sell gold and to acquire foreign currency and finally discriminated
Rusoro against privately owned gold producers.

The Republic disagrees. It says that the measures against which Rusoro rallies were
legitimate regulatory actions taken in the public interest to combat illegal activities,
that Rusoro had no legitimate expectation that the legal regime would remain
immutable and that the abolition of the Swap Market was a legitimate exercise of
Venezuela’s authority to enforce its laws.

3. Before adjudicating this issue (B. and C.), it is necessary to settle a preliminary

question: the relevance of the so called “customary international minimum
standard” [“CIM Standard] (A.).

A. Customary International Minimum Standard

Respondent says that the language of Art. II.2 of the Treaty explicitly qualifies the
FET standard by reference to “the principles of international law’*!*, which equate
with the CIM Standard.

Claimant disagrees: in its submission Art. II.2 of the Treaty does not require a
heightened threshold corresponding to an alleged CIM Standard*!>.

 

The starting point of this debate is the historic definition of the CIM Standard — a
question which is fraught with difficulties.

For claims arising from administrative or legislative acts of Governments (as is the
case in these Ancillary Claims) the historic leading case seems to be Roberts*'®,
issued by the United States - Mexico General Claims Commission in 1926, which
defined the minimum treatment as that required “in accordance with ordinary
standards of civilization”.

Roberts is understood to stand for the propositions that a certain treatment may give
rise to international responsibility notwithstanding that it affects citizens and aliens
alike, and that administrative and legislative actions may amount to a violation of

520.

521.

the customary minimum treatment even if the State did not act in bad faith or with
wilful neglect of duty*!’,

But the CIM Standard has not stood still, and in the century since it was first
defined, it has continuously developed. The tribunal in OJ European has thus
summarized the impact of this development’:

“El esténdar minimo consuetudinario no ha permanecido congelado, y desde
sus primeras formulaciones hace 100 afios se ha beneficiado de un desarrollo
importante, impulsado por el asentamiento de los Derechos Humanos y la
implantacién del Estado de Derecho. Bien entrado el siglo XXI Roberts es de
dudosa relevancia para la proteccién de inversores extranjeros frente a actos
administrativos, legislativos 0 judiciales que interfieran con el uso y disfrute
de su inversién. Lo relevante no es el estandar, tal como se definié en el siglo
XX, sino el esténdar tal como existe y se acepta hoy — pues tanto el Derecho
internacional consuetudinario como el propio estandar se hallan en constante
evolucién. Y es bien posible que en la actualidad el esténdar minimo
consuetudinario y el TJE previsto en los tratados hayan convergido, llegando
a otorgar al inversor niveles de proteccién sustancialmente equivalentes”.

The Tribunal shares Respondent’s interpretation that when Art. II.2 of the BIT
qualifies Venezuela’s commitment to accord FET (and FPS) treatment “in
accordance with the principles of international law”, the rule is referring to the CIM
Standard*!®. But the incorporation of the CIM Standard into the definition of the
FET does not provoke a major disruption in the level of protection: the CIS Standard
has developed and today is indistinguishable from the FET standard and grants
investors an equivalent level of protection as the latter. The whole discussion of
whether Art. II.2 of the BIT incorporates or fails to incorporate the CIS Standard
when defining FET has become dogmatic: there is no substantive difference in the
level of protection afforded by both standards.

Since CIS Standard and FET Standard have converged, Rusoro’s subsidiary
pleading, that the Tribunal apply (via the MFN clause contained in Art. III of the
BIT) the definition of the FET standard established in the Belarus-Venezuela
Treaty, which lacks a reference to “international law”, has become moot*”°.

417 While for claims based on denial of justice, aggravating circumstances like outrage, bad faith, willful
neglect of duty or other egregious behaviour are required; see Neer at 60; Lemire (Jurisdiction) at 249.

418 OI European at 489 (footnote omitted). “The minimum customary standard has not remained frozen. It
has developed significantly since its early formulations 100 years ago, driven by the establishment of
Human Rights and the implementation of the Rule of Law. Well into the 21“ century, Roberts is of dubious
relevance for the protection of foreign investors against administrative, legislative or judicial actions that
interfere with the use and enjoyment of their investment. What is relevant is no the standard as it was
defined in the 20" century, but rather the standard as it exists and is accepted today — since both Customary
International Law and the standard itself are constantly evolving. And it is quite possible that currently the
minimum customary standard and the FET envisaged in the treaties have converged, according the investor
with substantially equivalent levels of protection”.

B. The FET standard

. Art. II.2 of the BIT simply states that each Contracting Party shall accord protected

investments or returns “fair and equitable treatment”.

. Although the Treaty does not provide further guidance, it is generally accepted that

this undefined legal concept requires States to adopt a minimum standard of
conduct vis-a-vis aliens. A State breaches such minimum standard if actions (or in
certain circumstances omissions) occur, for which the State must assume
responsibility, and which violate certain thresholds of propriety or contravene basic
requirements of the rule of law, causing harm to the investor‘!. The obligation to
provide FET binds all branches of government, and can be disavowed

 

 

- by administrative acts, adopted by the government or its agencies, targeting
the investor or its investment directly,

- by judicial decisions, approved by the State’s judicial system, which are
directed directly against the investor or the investment personally and which
amount to a denial of justice,

- or finally by legislation, approved by the legislative power, or regulation,
adopted by government (or by another authority with regulatory powers),
affecting citizens in general, and the protected investor and investment in
particular.

The required threshold of propriety must be defined by the tribunal after a careful
analysis of facts and circumstances, and taking into consideration a number of
factors, including among others the following*”?:

 

- whether there has been harassment, coercion, abuse of power or other bad
faith conduct by the host State;

- whether the State had made specific representations to the investor, prior to
the investment;

- whether the State’s actions or omissions can be labelled as arbitrary,
discriminatory or inconsistent;

- whether the State has respected the principles of due process and transparency
when adopting the offending measures;

- whether the State has failed to offer a stable and predictable legal framework,
breaching the investor’s legitimate expectations.

In evaluating the State’s conduct, the Tribunal must balance the investor’s right to
be protected against improper State conduct, with other legally relevant interests
and countervailing factors. First among these factors is the principle that legislation
and regulation are dynamic, and that States enjoy a sovereign right to amend
legislation and to adopt new regulation in the furtherance of public interest. The

531.

right to regulate, however, does not authorize States to act in an arbitrary or
discriminatory manner, or to disguise measures targeted against a protected investor
under the cloak of general legislation. Other countervailing factors affect the
investor: it is the investor’s duty to perform an appropriate pre-investment due
diligence review and to show a proper conduct both before and during the
investment’,

Having defined the scope and meaning of the FET standard in the abstract, the
Tribunal must now analyse whether the proven facts contravene such standard.

C. Respondent’s conduct

Rusoro claims that the Bolivarian Republic breached the FET standard guaranteed
in the BIT, not by adopting administrative or judicial acts targeted directly against
Rusoro or its investment, but rather by two pieces of general legislation and
regulation:

 

- the 2010 Ley de Reforma Cambiaria approved by the Venezuelan Parliament
and

- the 2010 Measures approved by the BCV, using the powers vested by
Venezuelan law.

The Tribunal disagrees. Rusoro has failed to prove a breach of Art. II.2 of the
Treaty.

General exchange control regime

When Rusoro took the decision to invest in Venezuela, the 2003 exchange control
regime, regulated by the Convenio Cambiario No. 1, was already in place. This
regime forced exporters to sell (at least) 90% of the foreign currency revenues
earned by the export of goods to the BCV, at the Official Exchange Rate. It is true
that from 2003 through 2010, Venezuela tolerated the existence of a parallel Swap
Market, which permitted the acquisition and sale of USD against VEF at market
prices. But the Swap Market was completely unregulated, and its users simply
exploited a loophole in the exchange control legislation (which did not cover
securities transactions).

On 17 May 2010 the Asamblea Nacional adopted the Ley de Reforma Cambiaria,
a law which made the use of the Swap Market illegal*”*. The sale and purchase of
foreign currency became the exclusive purview of the BCV, through CADIVI, and
significant monetary and jail penalties were imposed for circumvention of the law.

States have the sovereign right to establish and amend, in furtherance of their
economic policy, exchange control regulations, which define the relationship
between the State’s own currency and that of other sovereigns. Exchange control
tules typically regulate

535.

536.

- the repatriation by residents of foreign currency earned abroad,

- the requirements and authorizations needed for the purchase by residents of
foreign currency and

- the system to establish the appropriate exchange rate between local and
foreign currency.

Claimant took the decision to invest in Venezuela when the Bolivarian Republic
already had an exchange control regime in place, which imposed compulsory
repatriation of (at least) 90% of foreign currency earned, required authorization
from CADIVI for purchases of foreign currency and defined the Official Exchange
Rate. The Bolivarian Republic never made any representation vis-a-vis Rusoro,
either before or after the investment, that Rusoro would somehow be exempted
from the application of the general exchange control regime. Claimant never
developed a legitimate expectation that in due course Venezuela would not adopt
more restrictive legislation, and that tolerance of the Swap Market would continue
sine die. Finally, there is no evidence that the 2010 Ley de Reforma Cambiaria was
improperly adopted, that its content is arbitrary or that its specific purpose was to
discriminate against Claimant.

 

 

. In these circumstances, Rusoro’s allegation that the closing of the Swap Market

implied a breach of the FET standard must fail.

Gold marketing

The powers of the BCV to regulate the gold market already existed when Rusoro
invested in Venezuela. The 1996 BCV Resolution imposed certain restrictions on
all Venezuelan gold miners: 15% of production had to be sold in the domestic
market, while the rest could be exported under supervision of the BCV.
Additionally, in 2003 the Convenio Cambiario No. | came in force, and this general
exchange control rule required that exporters sell to the BCV at the Official
Exchange rate 90% of the foreign currency earned’.

The July 2010 BCV Resolution significantly modified the system: 50% of Rusoro’s
production had now to be sold to the BCV, at a price expressed in VEF and
converted at the Official Exchange Rate, while the remaining 50% could be
exported, subject to authorization from the BCV. Simultaneously the Convenio
Cambiario No. 12 was amended, and gold producers were now required to sell 50%
of their foreign currency income from export operations to the BCV at the Official
Exchange Rate, but were authorized to use the other 50% (i.e. 25% of the total
production) for payments in foreign currency outside the Bolivarian Republic.

When Rusoro invested in Venezuela, it was (or should have been) aware that the
BCV had the power to impose restrictions on the free sale of gold by Venezuelan
mining companies and that under the relevant Convenios Cambiarios the BCV

+25 The Tribunal is aware that in practice the rule could be circumvented by using the unregulated Swap
Market. But for present purposes, the relevant fact is that the provision formed part of the Venezuelan
exchange control rule book, and that investors could and should be aware that in the future the Republic
could decide to effectively enforce the rule.

537.

540.

541.

could force exporters to sell up to 90% of the foreign currency earned at the Official
Exchange Rate. Rusoro never benefitted from any specific representation that
legislation would not be amended and that the gold marketing regime would not
become more restrictive. The 2010 Measures were adopted by BCV in accordance
with its statutory powers and in compliance with the appropriate administrative
procedures. Finally there is no evidence that the content of the 2010 Measures is
discriminatory: while the 2009 Measures provided for a distinct treatment of
publicly and privately owned mining companies, the 2010 Measures unified the
regime.

It is true that the 2010 Measures forced gold producers to sell 50% of their
production to the BCV (i) and that the price to be paid was to be calculated at the
Official Exchange Rate, set by the BCV (ii). But in the Tribunal’s opinion, there
are countervailing factors which justify the Measures:

(i) Gold is not an ordinary mineral; it is intimately connected with the monetary
sovereignty of nations, because central banks use gold as reserve assets to back the
national currency. The BCV, Venezuela’s central bank, has been entrusted, at least
since 1996, with the regulation of the Venezuelan gold market, and it has
consistently imposed restrictions on the sale and purchase of gold. An experienced
gold producer as Rusoro could have foreseen, when it invested, that the BCV could
use its regulatory powers to impose a compulsory sale of production to the central
bank.

(ii) Rusoro complains not only because of the compulsory nature of its sales to the
BCYV, but also because of the price applied: the BCV was paying international gold
prices, expressed in USD, converted into VEF at the Official Exchange Rate; by
applying the Official Exchange Rate the BCV was allegedly depriving the investor
of a significant portion of its value.

Rusoro’s argument might have been true, while the Swap Market was in operation,
because at that time there were two exchange rates, the Official Exchange Rate and
the market exchange rate applied in the Swap Market, which consistently was lower
than the Official Exchange Rate. But the situation changed when in 2010 Venezuela
decided to close the parallel market, and only permitted one single exchange rate,
i.e. the Official Exchange Rate. From that time on, all exporters — including gold
exporters — were forced to sell (a very high percentage of*”°) the foreign currency
earned to the BCV at the Official Exchange Rate, and the Official Exchange Rate
became the only legally relevant measure to establish the value in VEF of amounts
in foreign currency.

The Tribunal concludes that neither the July 2010 BCV Resolution, nor the
Amendment to the Convenio Cambiario No. 12 (which together form the 2010
Measures), nor the 2010 Ley de Reforma Cambiaria eliminating the Swap Market,
breached Venezuela’s commitment to provide FET to Rusoro’s investment.

FPS
Art. IL.2 of the BIT provides as follows:

“Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the principles of
international law, accord investments or returns of investors of the other
Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment and full protection and
security”.

 

3. Claimant says that the FPS standard imposes an obligation of due diligence and

vigilance on the host State, which is not limited to physical protection, and that
Venezuela breached that principle by adopting the 2009 and 2010 Measures, by
shutting-down the Swap Market in 2010 and by denying Rusoro access to foreign
currency in the post-nationalization phase*?’.

Even if the Treaty were found to guarantee only physical security, Rusoro would
still benefit from FPS (via the Treaty’s MFN clause), because Venezuela guaranteed
“full protection and legal security” under the Uruguay-Venezuela BIT’.

Respondent says that Art. II.2 of the BIT prescribes the minimum standard of FPS
under customary international law*”’, and this standard only protects persons and
property from physical harm — and no physical harm is being alleged by
Claimant‘. Even if FPS is extended beyond physical harm, the manner in which
Venezuela amended its regulation was lawful**!.

The Tribunal has already concluded that any claim based on the adoption of the
2009 Measures is time barred‘**. Consequently Claimant’s allegation that the
Bolivarian Republic breached the FPS standard enshrined in Art. II.2 of the Treaty
is premised on the adoption of three measures:

 

- (i) The issuance of the 2010 Measures,

- (ii) The promulgation of the 2010 Ley de Reforma Cambiaria eliminating the
Swap Market and

- (iii) The denial of foreign currency to Rusoro’s subsidiaries in the post-
nationalization phase.

The Parties discuss whether the FPS guarantee offered to investors in accordance
with Art. II.2 of the BIT only covers physical harm (as Respondent says), or
whether it should be extended (directly or via the MFN clause) to also cover legal
certainty (as is Claimant’s contention). The Tribunal does not have to delve into
this debated issue, because even assuming arguendo the widest possible

construction of the FPS standard, there can be no doubt that Venezuela never
incurred in a breach:

(i) and (ii): The Tribunal has already concluded that the 2010 Measures and the
abolition of the Swap Market were formalized in laws and regulations adopted by
Venezuela and did not amount to a breach of the FET standard; consequently, such
measures can never imply a breach of the FPS standard, however widely
interpreted.

(iii) Claimant also refers to a third measure, which allegedly occurred in the post-
nationalization phase, while Rusoro still transitorily managed the nationalized
mines. Rusoro says that during that period its Venezuelan subsidiaries were illicitly
denied the foreign currency required for their day-to-day operations.

The problem with this allegation is that it is unsupported in evidence.

Following the Nationalization Decree, and while the negotiations were taking place,
the BCV issued a special rule, Convenio Cambiario No. 19** which authorized
nationalized gold producers to acquire foreign currency, subject to administrative
authorization. Rusoro complains that such authorization was never granted and that
it never had access to the required foreign currency*™.

The only piece of evidence to which Rusoro refers is the witness statement of its
employee Sr. Matias Herrero*>. A careful review of the WS shows that Sr. Herrero
does not say that Rusoro’s subsidiaries were systematically denied access to foreign
currency; his statement is much more nuanced: the government did grant the
requisite authorization, but then “the BCV would often decline our requests for
payment”. Sr. Herrero does not explain the meaning of “often”, and does not
provide any further information regarding the percentage of rejections by the BCV.
Even assuming the veracity of Sr. Herrero’s statement at face value, the only point
which is proven is that the BCV sometimes granted the requests for foreign
currency, and sometimes denied them.

3. The evidence marshalled by Rusoro is manifestly insufficient to prove its allegation

that Venezuela illicitly denied access to the foreign currency required for the day-
to-day operations of its subsidiaries.

2k

The Tribunal therefore concludes that neither the 2010 Measures, nor the
elimination of the Swap Market, nor the BCV’s conduct after the Nationalization
Decree regarding the issuance of authorization to Rusoro to acquire foreign
currency amount to a violation of the FPS standard.

DISCRIMINATION

Art. IV.1 of the BIT provides as follows:

“Each Contracting Party shall grant to investments or returns of investors of
the other Contracting Party treatment no less favourable than that which, in
like circumstances, it grants to investments or returns of its own investors”.

Rusoro says that with the enactment of the 2009 Measures*** Venezuela

discriminated against Claimant’s investments, by creating more favourable rules
for Venezuelan State-owned producers than those it applied to foreign producers**’;
and by promoting small-scale private producers against Rusoro, the only large scale
private producer***,

Venezuela denies having discriminated against Rusoro and that the alleged
discrimination in any case ceased with the adoption of the 2010 Measures*?.

The Tribunal sides with the Bolivarian Republic.

The 2009 Measures gave different treatment to publicly and to privately owned gold
mining companies, and such difference in treatment, if not properly justified, could
indeed have given rise to a breach of the equal treatment principle established in
Art. IV.1 of the BIT. But any claim based on the 2009 Measures has become time
barred“, And in any case, the 2010 Measures unified the regime applicable to
privately and publicly owned miners. Any alleged discrimination between public
and private gold miners is a thing of the past.

Rusoro also argues that, through the 2010 Measures, it was discriminated vis-a-vis
small-scale private producers.

The 2010 Measures contain two specific rules for small scale producers of gold:

- the July 2010 BCV Resolution requires small-scale producers to offer 15% of
their production to the BCV or to sell it in the domestic market**!, and

- the Amendment to the Convenio Cambiario No. 12 requires that small
producers sell 70% of the foreign currency income obtained from gold
exports to the BCV*?.

The comparable figures for full scale producers like Rusoro (and for all public
owned mining companies) are 50% obligatory offer to the BCV, with a 50%
percentage of repatriation of foreign currency. The treatment given to small scale
producers is thus on one side more lenient, and on the other side more stringent than
that offered to large producers.

. Art. IV.1 of the BIT only requires that Venezuela grant treatment no less favourable

to Rusoro than that which, “in like circumstances”, grants to its own investors. The
Bolivarian Republic has adopted an official policy, differentiating between small

scale, traditional miners and large mining companies and offering additional
support and less stringent requirements to small miners. Thus Rusoro (and other
large miners) and small scale miners are not “in like circumstances”, and the
difference in treatment is justified by valid policy reasons.

564. The Tribunal finds that the distinct treatment given to small scale miners in the 2010
Measures does not result in a breach of Art. IV.1 of the BIT. Rusoro’s claim for
discrimination cannot succeed.

3.6 FREE TRANSFER OF FUNDS

565. Claimant argues that the Bolivarian Republic breached two distinct provisions of
the BIT, which refer to or are related with the free transfer of funds: Art. VIII.1 and
para. 6 (d) of the Annex to the Treaty.

A. Art. VIII

566. Art. VIII.1 and 2 of the BIT provide as follows:

“1. Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to an investor of the other
Contracting Party the unrestricted transfer of investments and returns. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Contracting Party shall also
guarantee to the investor the unrestricted transfer of:

(a) funds in repayment of loans related to an investment;
(b) the proceeds of the total or partial liquidation of any investment;

(c) wages and other remuneration accruing to a citizen of the other
Contracting Party who was permitted to work in a capacity that is
managerial, executive or involves specialized knowledge in connection
with an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party;

(d) any compensation owed to an investor by virtue of Articles VI or VII of
the Agreement.

2. Transfers shall be effected without delay in the convertible currency in
which the capital was originally invested or in any other convertible currency
agreed by the investor and the Contracting Party concerned. Unless otherwise
agreed by the investor, transfers shall be made at the rate of exchange
applicable on the date of transfer”.

 

Is gold a “return”?

567. Rusoro’

 

rting point is that gold falls within the definition of “returns” and that

exports of gold are protected by the rule contained in Art. VIIL.1 of the BIT: that

investors are entitled to the “unrestricted transfer” of “investments and returns’

27443,

#8 C Tat 272; C PHB at 131.

125

568. Venezuela denies that the gold produced by Rusoro can be considered for purposes
of the BIT as “returns”. Gold is a commodity, not a currency. It can only become a
currency if it is minted and becomes legal tender by government".

569. The Tribunal again considers Respondent’s arguments to be right.

570. Art. VIII.1 of the BIT establishes the principle that protected Canadian investors
can make “unrestricted transfer[s]” of their “investments and returns” in Venezuela
and, after defining this general principle, provides an open list of examples:

- Repayment of loans related to an investment,

- proceeds from liquidation,

- certain wages paid to executives, and

- compensation for expropriation or other losses.

S71.

“Investment” and “return” are terms defined in the BIT:
- in accordance with Art I. (f) “investment” is

“any kind of asset owned or controlled by an investor [...] in the territory of
the other Contracting Party, [including] shares [or] stocks [...]”;

- while “return” is defined in Art. I. (i) as

“all amounts yielded by an investment and in particular, though not
exclusively, [...] profits, interest, dividends, royalties, fees, other current
income or capital gains”.

572. It is undisputed that Rusoro’s “investment” in Venezuela consisted in “shares and
stocks” of certain Venezuelan companies holding Mining Rights. Having made the
investment, Art. VIIL.1 (in connection with the definitions of Art I.) guarantees
Rusoro the right to an “unrestricted transfer” of funds outside Venezuela in relation
with three categories of monetary flows:

 

- All “returns” which Rusoro may generate as a consequence of its status as
investor, including dividends and profits,

- The price which Rusoro may collect in an eventual disposition of its
investment, including capital gains, or alternatively,

- Any compensation payable by the Bolivarian Republic in an eventual
expropriation of Rusoro’s investment.

573. The BIT’s guarantee that “returns” arising from the investment may be freely
transferred does not cover, however, the entrepreneurial activities of Rusoro’s
subsidiaries in Venezuela. If these subsidiaries perform an export activity, the price
received from the third party who imports the product, is simply a price received

576.

577.

578.

579.

by a Venezuelan corporation in exchange for a commodity, not a “return” earned
by Rusoro as a consequence of the holding of an investment in Venezuela.

The fact that the product exported by Rusoro’s subsidiaries is gold does not change
this conclusion. Gold is a commodity, not a currency: it only becomes a currency if
a sovereign state decides to mint it and to make it legal tender (which did not happen
in this case). Rusoro’s subsidiaries mine the gold to sell it as a commodity to
unrelated third parties — not to distribute it to their shareholder in lieu of dividends.
As Respondent rightly says, Claimant’s gold is no more a return than is a car
produced by a foreign investor in its car factory in Venezuela.

 

Implic: for Cl ant’s claim

The finding that gold is not a return, and that its sales are not protected by Art. VIII,
plus the decision, already adopted by the Tribunal, that the 2009 Measures are
affected by the statute of limitations“**, does away with the majority of Rusoro’s
claims under this heading. The only claims left are those based on the 2010
Measures, the 2010 Ley de Reforma Cambiaria which abolished the Swap Market
and the alleged denial to Rusoro of required foreign currency in the post-
nationalization phase.

  

 

Art. VIIL1 and 2 of the BIT guarantee investors that they will be able to transfer
funds related to their investments and returns without delay, in a convertible
currency and at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of transfer.

Provided that this triple guarantee is complied with, the BIT does not impose
restrictions on the manner in which Contracting States decide to regulate their
exchange control regime. States have the choice of abolishing all exchange control
restrictions, of establishing certain limits or of submitting all foreign currency
transactions to administrative control.

 

After 2010 the Bolivarian Republic has chosen to impose a stringent exchange
control mechanism, in which residents in Venezuela must acquire foreign currency
via an administrative authorization, must sell a high percentage of foreign currency
earned to the BCV, and in which the Official Exchange rate is established by fiat of
the BCV. Each of these choices is a policy decision, which the Bolivarian Republic
is empowered to adopt exercising its monetary sovereignty, and which is
compatible with the guarantees offered to protected investors in the BIT. Art. VIII
simply requires that if a protected investor requests foreign currency in relation to
its investment or returns, the application must be approved without delay, the funds
delivered in convertible currency and at the Official Exchange Rate prevailing at
the date of transfer.

 

The 2010 M and the 2010 Ley de Reforma Cambiaria

Neither the 2010 Measures nor the 2010 Ley de Reforma Cambiaria, which
abolished the Swap Market, breached the prohibition established in Art. VIII of the
BIT:

+45 See paras, 232 et seq supra.

127

580.

581.

582.

584.

585.

(i) The scope of the 2010 Measures was limited to regulating the sale and export of
gold mined in Venezuela, and the repatriation of the purchase price, not the transfer
of investments and returns in the gold sector; these 2010 Measures can never give
rise to a breach of the guarantee offered in Art. VIII.

(ii) And the 2010 reform of the Swap Market was a policy decision adopted by the
Bolivarian Republic in order to prohibit a parallel foreign currency market, which
up to then had been tolerated**; after the reform all foreign currency transactions
were to be cleared through a centralized exchange control system, controlled by the
BCV and based on the Official Exchange Rate.

This reform could only give rise to a breach of Art. VIII if Rusoro could prove that
it had requested foreign currency in connection with an investment or a return, and
that the authorization had not been granted as required by the BIT (without delay,
in a convertible currency and at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of
transfer) — which Rusoro has not alleged.

Post-nationalization denial of currency

- Rusoro’s only allegation in this regard is that during the post-nationalization phase

its subsidiaries were illicitly denied foreign currency*#’. But the Tribunal has
already found that Claimant has failed to marshal evidence supporting this
submission*’, Consequently, there is no substantiation that the 2010 prohibition of
the Swap Market, and the ensuing centralization of the exchange control regime,
restrained Rusoro’s rights to unrestricted transfer of investments and returns
guaranteed by Art. VIII of the BIT.

B. Paragraph 6 (d

Paragraph 6 (d) of Part II of the Annex to the BIT [“Paragraph 6 (d)”] provides as
follows:

“6. Neither Contracting Party may impose any of the following requirements
in connection with permitting the establishment or acquisition of an
investment or enforce any of the following requirements in connection with
the subsequent regulation of that investment:

L..]

(d) restrictions on exportation or sale for export by an enterprise of products,
whether specified in terms of particular products, in terms of volume or value
of products, or in terms of a proportion of volume of its local production”.

And Art. XVI.2 clarifies that

denials of foreign currency requests made by the Venezuelan subsidiaries in their export/import activities;
such requests in any case fall outside the scope of protection of Art. VIII.

“the Annex hereto shall for all purposes constitute an integral part of this
Agreement”.

 

The Parties’ positions

Claimant says that in the BIT Venezuela guaranteed not to enforce any regulation
restricting the export of gold produced by Rusoro. The 2010 Measures imposed a
variety of restrictions, both direct and indirect, on Rusoro’s ability to export gold,
and consequently contravened Paragraph 6 (d)*#°.

Respondent’s only defence is that the regime for gold marketing in place in 2003
required repatriation of 90% of all foreign currency from exports of gold. This is
equivalent to the requirement established by the 2010 Measures to sell gold to the
BCV450,

The Tribunal’s decision

 

The Tribunal sides with Claimant: The 2010 BCV Resolution is incompatible with,
and represents a breach of Paragraph 6 (d) of the Annex to the BIT.

Paragraph 6 (d), which is an integral part of the BIT, prohibits Contracting Parties
to

“enforce any of the following requirements in connection with the subsequent
lie. post-establishment] regulation of that investment:”

Among the prohibited requirements are
“restrictions on exportation or sale for export by an enterprise of products,

whether specified in terms of particular products, in terms of volume or value
of products [...]”.

 

At the time when Rusoro made its investments, the export of gold was regulated by
the 1996 BCV Resolution**!, which mandated that each gold producer sell at least
15% of its total production in the private domestic market. This restriction, which
implied that only 85% of total production could be exported, was accepted by
Rusoro, and its legality has not be challenged and falls outside the Tribunal’s remit.

In July 2010 the BCV decided to issue the July 2010 BCV Resolution**? (which is
one of the two 2010 Measures). This new Resolution limited the amount of gold
which any private Venezuelan gold producer could export, and it did so by volume:
50% of the production in each quarter had to be compulsorily sold to the BCV, and
export was restricted to the remaining 50%, subject to authorization from the BCV.

The July 2010 BCV Resolution is clearly incompatible with the plain wording of
Paragraph 6 (d): the Resolution creates a “requirement”, to be enforced by the BCV.

+ C II at 277; C PHB at 137-138; in para. 137 Claimant argues that Venezuela also breached para. 6 (c) of
the Annex to the BIT. This is not so: Venezuela never restricted Rusoro’s “access to foreign exchange to
an amount related to the foreign exchange inflows attributable to the enterprise”.

t-establishment phase of the investment, restricting the “exportation by an
ise” [i.e. Rusoro’s Venezuelan subsidiaries] of its products “in terms of
volume” — precisely what Paragraph 6 (d) prohibits.

. Aprecision: The 1996 BCV Resolution had already created a legal regime limiting

the export of gold to 85% of production. The July 2010 BCV Resolution increased
the export restriction to 50% of production, and it is this increase which is
incompatible with Paragraph 6 (d) of the Treaty**.

Respondent's defence

Respondent’s only defence is that the regime for gold exports in place in 2003
required repatriation of 90% of all foreign currency earned. The defence has no
bearing. The purpose of Paragraph 6 (d) is to guarantee that protected investors,
who have taken the risk of investing in a Contracting State, will not be burdened
with restraints on their capacity to export the products manufactured by their local
enterprise. The rule does not address the (separate) issue of repatriation of proceeds
earned as a consequence of an export activity.

 

Respondent avers that in 2003 Venezuela had a compulsory repatriation regime for
export earnings at the Official Exchange Rate. The statement may be true or false
(Convenio Cambiario No. | required the repatriation of earnings, but the principle
was subverted by the tolerance of the Swap Market). In any case that argument is
irrelevant for deciding whether the July 2010 BCV Resolution imposed quantitative
export restrictions on gold produced by Rusoro’s Venezuelan subsidiaries and
whether such restriction ran afoul of the prohibition imposed by Paragraph 6 (d).

CONCLUSION
Summing up, the Tribunal dismisses Claimant's claims that the Bolivarian Republic
- breached the principles of FET and FPS, provided for in Art. II.2 of the BIT,

- subjected Rusoro’s investment to a discriminatory treatment in breach of
Art. IV.1 of the BIT, and

- restricted Rusoro’s right to transfer investments and returns in breach of
Art. VIIL1 of the BIT.

The Tribunal, however, finds that by issuing the 2010 BCV Resolution the
Bolivarian Republic imposed an increased restriction in terms of volume on the
exportation of gold, and that such increase was in breach of Paragraph 6 (d) of the
Annex to the BIT.

VIIL4. VENEZUELA’S COUNTER-CLA.

 

Should the Tribunal reject all of Venezuela’s jurisdictional objections, and find that
it has jurisdiction to decide the present dispute, Venezuela asserts a counter-claim

. Respondent additionally submits that the Tribunal

against Claimant, based on Rusoro’s alleged improper mining practices of the
Choco 10 deposit. In Venezuela’s opinion, Rusoro’s mining strategy had a
detrimental impact on the future viability of the mine.

Rusoro’s first defence against the counter-claim is that the BIT establishes no
jurisdictional basis for this Tribunal to adjudicate counter-claims submitted by a
respondent State. Additionally, Claimant says that Respondent has not identified
any legal obligation allegedly breached by Rusoro, and has failed to marshal any
factual evidence in support of its averment and to quantify the damage allegedly
suffered.

RESPONDENT’S COUNTER-CLAIM

Venezuela says that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to adjudicate its counter-claim,
pursuant to Article 47 of the Arbitration AF Rules, which provides that:

“(1) Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental
or additional claim or counter-claim, provided that such ancillary claim is
within the scope of the arbitration agreement of the parties”.

Venezuela submits that Article XII.1 of the BIT defines the scope of arbitrable
disputes to
“[a]ny dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor”***,
In Venezuela’s view, its counter-claim based on Rusoro’s inadequate mining
practices falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement between the Parties,
since it is directly related to Rusoro’s claims in this arbitration.

s adjudication of Venezuela’s
counter-claim serves the interest of procedural efficiency and economy, because all
issues related to this dispute would be resolved in the same forum. The opposite
solution would require Venezuela to file its claim before Venezuelan courts. This
option would entail additional (yet unnecessary) time and resources for both Parties,
and could result in inconsistent rulings, which in turn would originate further
unnecessary litigation costs*®.

  

  

  

Merits

Venezuela avers that Rusoro implemented a “short term production gains” mining
strategy, which had an impact on the future profitability of the Choco 10 mine**”.

In 2007, in the context of the Gold Fields transaction by which Rusoro acquired the
Choco 10 mine, Rusoro commissioned the mineral consulting firm Micon to
prepare a NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Choco 10 mine [Micon 2007

Technical Report”}***. This report gathered relevant information on the mine
property, geological and mineral data, current exploration and exploitation results,
and also an analysis of the prospective development and future production of the
mine. One of the conclusions arrived at by the consulting firm was that Rusoro was
required to strip between 9 million and 16 million tonnes of waste rock*?.

606. It is Venezuela’s contention that since 2008“ Rusoro deviated from the mining
plan envisaged in the Micon 2007 Technical Report, and centred its activities on
the mining of soft rock material located at the surface of the deposits"! (easier to
mine and at a lesser cost). This mining practice implied delaying costs into the
future, by leaving the mining of deeper and harder ore to forthcoming years. The
effects of Rusoro’s improper mining practices have jeopardized the original
production targets of the mine and have had a negative impact on future mining
costs*®,

 

 

 

607. Venezuela also submits a witness statement by Mr. Fernando Barrios, former
engineer in the Ministry of Mines, and currently serving as General Manager of
Operations at CVG — which now operates the Choco 10 deposit*?. Mr. Barrios
concurs with Respondent’s expert, and avers that the current accumulation of waste
material caused by Rusoro’s “irresponsible” mining practices has jeopardized the
original production targets of the Choco 10 mine**.

608. According to Mr. Barrios and Mr. Grandillo of BBA Inc. [“BBA”], Rusoro’s sole
purpose when implementing its mining strategy was to achieve higher gold
production rates in the early years which would secure the desired short term
profits’.

Quantum

609. Respondent avers that, in order to quantify the damage caused by Rusoro’s conduct
when operating the Choco 10 mine, it required access to certain information which
was in possession of Rusoro*®°. However, given that Rusoro did not provide such

information to its own expert, it was not obliged (under the Tribunal’s directions)

to facilitate that information to Venezuela’s expert either. As a result, Mr.

Grandillo, Venezuela’s expert, was unable to quantify Venezuela’s loss caused by

Claimant’ s improper mining of the Choco 10 deposit*®”.

Therefore, Venezuela requests that the Tribunal find that Rusoro is liable for its
improper mining practices when operating the Choco 10 mine, and declare that
there is insufficient information to determine an award on damages to either
party**,

CLAIMANT’S POSITION

Claimant’s first defence is that the BIT does not offer a basis for the Tribunal to
hear a counter-claim advanced by Venezuela“. The fact that the counter-claim is
related to Rusoro’s claims in this arbitration, as averred by Venezuela, is irrelevant
for the purpose of jurisdiction*”°.

The Contracting States to the BIT only consented to resolve through arbitration the
disputes submitted by investors of the Contracting States‘”!. The language of the
BIT in Art. XII is clear".

Merits

. Even if the Tribunal should find that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate Venezuela’s

counter-claim, Respondent has not provided any legal or factual basis for its
allegations: Venezuela has not been able to single out a law which prohibits Rusoro
to operate the Choco 10 mine as it did, nor that a breach of such law took place‘”>.

Claimant’s mining expert - Mr. Tim Swendseid, from the firm Runge Pincock
Minarco [“RPM”] — declares that the deviations from the Micon 2007 Technical
Report were routine modifications to the mining plan, something that is common in
the mining industry*”4. Mr. Gregory Smith — former Vice President of Rusoro —
endorses Mr. Swendseid’s opinion, stating that he had

“never seen a mining company carry out a mining plan over an extended
period of time exactly as it was first written”*”.

According to Mr. Smith, one of the reasons which explain the deviations from the
Micon 2007 Technical Report was Rusoro’s restriction of access to foreign
currency. The Micon 2007 Technical Report required a capital expenditure for a
new crusher, necessary to grind the hard rock. As a consequence of the 2009 and
2010 Measures, Rusoro was deprived from access to foreign currency, which
prevented the purchase of the new crusher*”®. Under these circumstances, Rusoro
was forced to continue stripping the saprolite from the surface*”’.

. The first issue which the Tribunal must addres

N

. Claimant submits that before this arbitration Venezuela never complained or
criticised Rusoro’s operation of the Choco 10 mine‘,

Quantum

. Lastly, Rusoro argues that the counter-claim should be rejected in any case, because
Respondent has been unable to quantify the alleged loss suffered*””.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

. Venezuela submits a counter-claim against Rusoro arguing that Claimant caused
damage to the natural resources of the Bolivarian Republic by adopting improper
mining practices in the Choco 10 mine, contrary to its own mining plans**°.
Respondent clarifies that the counter-claim is purely declaratory, because it has
been unable to quantify its claim: despite repeated requests, Rusoro refused to
provide the information necessary for Venezuela’s experts to do so**!. Venezuela
therefore asks the Tribunal to find that Rusoro is liable for the harm caused and to

declare that there is insufficient information in the record to award damages**”.

 

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction

is whether it has jurisdiction to
adjudicate Venezuela’s counter-claim against Rusoro.

 

. Article 47 of the Arbitration AF Rules provides that**?:

“(1) Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental
or additional claim or counter-claim, provided that such ancillary claim is
within the scope of the arbitration agreement of the parti

 

(2) An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the
reply and a counter-claim no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the
Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and
upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation
of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding”.

. The AF Rules permit the submission of counter-claims, but subject to the condition
that the counter-claim fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. In the
present case, the arbitration agreement is to be found in Art. XII of the Treaty — it
is from this provision from where the Tribunal derives its jurisdiction.

“ARTICLE XII — Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the
Host Contracting Party

1. Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or
not taken by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and
that the investor or an enterprise owned or controlled directly or indirectly by
the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that
breach, shall, to the extent possible, be settled amicably between them.

 

2. If a dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months
from the date on which it was initiated, it may be submitted by the investor to
arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4). For the purpose of this
paragraph, a dispute is considered to be initiated when the investor of one
Contracting Party has delivered notice in writing to the other Contracting
Party alleging that a measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting Party
is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor or an enterprise owned or
controlled directly or indirectly by the investor has incurred loss or damage
by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.

3. An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to

arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:

(a) the investor has consented in writing thereto;

(b) the investor has waived its right to initiate or continue any other
proceedings in relation to the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this
Agreement before the courts or tribunals of the Contracting Party concerned
or in a dispute settlement procedure of any kind;

(©) [1

(d) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor
first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach
and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage”.

4. The dispute may, by the investor concerned, be submitted to arbitration
under [...];

7. A tribunal established under this Article shall decide the issues in dispute
in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law

Interpretation of Art. XII of the Treaty

623. Art. XII.1 restricts the scope of arbitrable disputes, to those based on a

“claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the [host State] is
in breach of this Agreement”.

624. If an investor holds a claim for breach of the BIT against the host State, Art. XII.2

permits the investor to define such claim, to notify it to the host state and to
determine the scope of the future arbitration:

135

625.

626.

627.

628.

629.

630.

631.

“For the purpose of this paragraph, a dispute is considered to be initiated when
the investor of one Contracting Party has delivered notice in writing to the
other Contracting Party alleging that a measure taken or not taken by the latter
Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement”.

Absent amicable settlement within a six-month period, the investor and only the
investor has the right to file an arbitration:

 

“Tf a dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from

the date on which it was initiated, it may be submitted by the investor to
arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) [...].

Art. XII.3 and Art. XIL.4 each reiterate again expressis verbis that the standing to
file an arbitration corresponds exclusively to the investor.

The literal wording of Art. XII does not leave room for doubt: the Treaty affords
investors, and only investors, standing to file arbitrations against host States; and
the purpose of the arbitrations is for arbitrators to adjudicate disputes relating “to a
claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by [the host State] is in
breach of this Agreement”, by applying the Treaty and applicable rules of
international law.

In its counter-claim, the Republic submits that Rusoro intentionally failed to adhere
to the mine plan, in breach of its obligations vis-a-vis the Republic and thereby
caused damage to Venezuela. There are three reasons why the Tribunal has no
jurisdiction to adjudicate this dispute:

   

  

, the Tribunal’s power is limited to adjudicating disputes which arise
from the BIT, and the obligations allegedly breached by Rusoro do not derive
from and have no connection with the Treaty;

- Second, the Tribunal must decide the dispute in accordance with the Treaty
and the principles of international law, and the dispute underlying the counter-
claim — that Rusoro breached the mine plan — and cannot be adjudicated by
applying the Treaty or principles of international law;

- Third, the Treaty does not afford host States a cause of action against an
investor of the other Contracting Party, be it by way of claim or of counter-
claim.

 

Summing up, the Tribunal finds that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the counter-
claim submitted by the Bolivarian Republic against Rusoro.

Case law

The Parties have drawn the Tribunal’s attention to two previous decisions, adopted
by tribunals with regard to counter-claims.

The first decision is Roussalis, an ICSID arbitration in which the respondent State
filed several counter-claims. The tribunal concluded that the consent to arbitration
under the BIT does not per se imply a consent to arbitrate counter-claims. In that
case the applicable BIT limited jurisdiction to claims brought by investors referring

136

632.

to obligations of the host State. The tribunal concluded that the BIT did not permit
host States to introduce counter-claims relating to obligations of the investor arising
from instruments other than the applicable treaty*®>.

The second decision is Hamester, a case where the Respondent State - Ghana —
submitted a counter-claim, requesting the tribunal to indemnify the State for the
damages caused for the investor’s irregular conduct***, Respondent did not develop
this argument, and the tribunal dismissed the counter-claim for lack of
substantiation**’ and also for lack of jurisdiction (since the harm allegedly caused
was not suffered by the State, but by a third party)***. In an obiter dictum the tribunal
mentioned that the treaty language, which permitted “the aggrieved party” to refer
a dispute to arbitration, might in other circumstances permit the host State to submit
a claim“. The dictum of Hamester is inapposite to the present case, because the
treaty language is radically different (the Canada-Venezuela BIT clearly and
repeatedly limits the right to introduce arbitrations to the investor and lacks any
reference to the “aggrieved party”).

Venezuela’s complaint that Rusoro did not provide information

. Although the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide the counter-claim, a short

comment must be devoted to Venezuela’s argument that Claimant’s refusal to
deliver documents made it impossible to quantify the harm caused by Rusoro’s
failure to adhere to the mining plan‘. The argument is difficult to follow. The
Bolivarian Republic has expropriated Rusoro’s mines, together with all supporting
staff, records and documentation. It must have at its disposal (and much readier than
Claimant) all the relevant documentation and evidence to prove that Rusoro, while
it managed the mine, did not adhere to the mine plan.

VIII. QUANTUM

Having come to the conclusion that the Bolivarian Republic unlawfully
expropriated Claimant’s enterprise in Venezuela and that it also imposed an
unlawful restriction on the exportation of the gold produced by the Claimant, the
Tribunal must now address the issue of guantum.

  

The

 

‘ies’ positio!

 

Rusoro is claiming three different types of compensation:

- The fair market value of Rusoro’s investment in Venezuela as of 16
September 2011, estimated by Navigant at USD 2.23 billion*”!;

- The cash flows allegedly lost between 30 April 2009 and 16 September 2011
as a result of the 2009, the 2010 Measures and the closure of the Swap Market
adopted by the Bolivarian Republic [“Lost Cash Flows”], in an amount of
USD 85.4 million*”?;

- Pre- and post-award interest on the amounts awarded at Venezuela’s
borrowing rate’.

Venezuela submits that Rusoro has failed to meet its burden to prove the quantum
of its damages, or, if the Tribunal were to find otherwise, that damages be limited
to a compensation of USD 1.5 million, reduced by 50% for contributory fault and
detrimental reliance*"’.

Treaty pro ns
Article XIL9 provides as follows:
“A tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:
(a) monetary damages and any applicable interest;
(b) restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the
disputing Contracting Party may pay monetary damages and any
applicable interest in lieu of restitution.

A tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration
rules.

Where an investor brings a claim under this Article regarding loss or damage
suffered by an enterprise the investor directly or indirectly owns or controls
any award shall be made to the affected enterprise”.

642.

This rule authorizes the Tribunal to award “monetary damages” plus “applicable
interest”, and Article XII.7 specifies that it must decide “in accordance with this
Agreement and applicable rules of international law”.

The Treaty only contains one specific rule regarding damages: Article VII says that
expropriation must be made “against prompt, adequate and_ effective
compensation”. The rule then provides the following additional criteria:

“Such compensation shall be based on the genuine value of the investment or
returns expropriated immediately before the expropriation or at the time the
proposed expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier,
shall be payable from the date of expropriation with interest at a normal
commercial rate, shall be paid without delay and shall be effectively realizable
and freely transferable.”

The compensation provided for in Article VII only covers cases of expropriation.
In all other breaches, absent any specific Treaty language, damages must be
calculated in accordance with the rules of international law. The relevant principle
was originally formulated in the seminal judgement of the Permanent Court of
International Justice in the Chorzéw case: reparation must wipe-out the
consequences of the breach and re-establish the situation as it is likely to have been
absent the breach. This well-established principle complements those found in the
ILC Articles, and particularly in Article 31, to make full reparation for injury caused
as a consequence of a violation of international law“.

. Additional principles of international law mandate that Claimant bear the burden of

proof, and that damages be certain, in the sense that speculative or hypothetical
harm be excluded, not in that of scientific certainty4*.

Any assessment of damages in a complex factual situation, involving revenue-
generating enterprises, includes some degree of estimation — the same degree which
is also applied by (private and government) actors in the real world when valuing
ises. Because of this difficulty, tribunals retain a certain margin of
appreciation. This should not be confused with acting ex aequo et bono, because
the Tribunal’s margin of appreciation can only be exercised in a reasoned manner
and with full respect of the principles of international law for the calculation of
damages”.

 

Evidence

. The Parties have submitted extensive evidence to support their cases:

- Rusoro has produced two financial expert reports prepared by Mr. Brent C.
Kaczmarek, from Navigant Consulting Inc. [“Navigant”]: NAV I, dated 20
March 2013 and NAV II, dated 12 June 2014. Additionally, Rusoro retained
the services of Mr. Tim J. Swendseid, from Runge Pincock Minarco, to

produce a technical report on Rusoro’s mining projects in Venezuela: RPM I,
dated 11 June 2014.

- ‘Venezuela’s financial experts were Dr. James C. Burrows from Charles River
Associates [“CRA”], who prepared two expert reports: CRA I, dated 30
January 2014, and CRA II, dated 13 October 2014; and Mr. John G. Brim,
who prepared another report: Brim, dated 13 October 2014. Additionally
‘Venezuela produced two technical reports on Rusoro’s mines prepared by Mr.
Angelo Grandillo from BBA Inc.: BBA I, dated 30 January 2014, and
BBA IL, dated 10 October 2014.

On the last day of the Hearing, and with the consent of the Parties, the Tribunal
requested the financial experts, Navigant and CRA, to jointly prepare tables of
discounted cash flow valuations under alternative sets of assumptions‘®®. On 27
February 2015 the experts presented the tables [‘Joint-Tables”], and their
respective comments. The Tribunal thanks the experts for their additional effort.

The Tribunal will analyse in a first section Rusoro’s request for compensation
resulting from the expropriation of its Venezuelan assets (VIIL1.), and in
subsequent sections the claims for additional damages due to the Lost Cash Flows
(VIII.2.), the interest accruing on the amounts awarded (VIII.3.), and Rusoro’s
claim that the award be net of Venezuelan taxes (VIII.

 

VIII.1. COMPENSATION FOR EXPROPRIATION

The Bolivarian Republic has committed a fundamental breach of the Treaty: the
unlawful expropriation of Rusoro’s Venezuelan enterprise. Art. VII of the BIT
mandates that Venezuela pay to the investor “adequate” compensation, “based on
the genuine value of the investment” expropriated. The devil is the quantification:
while Rusoro, supported by its expert, comes up with a “genuine value” of USD
2.23 billion, the Bolivarian Republic and its own advisors reduce the amount to a
mere USD 1.5 million.

Although in quantitative terms the difference between the Parties is colossal, there
are two important issues on which both parties agree, and which the Tribunal
consequently will apply without further discussion:

 

 

- The first is that the proper valuation date is 16 September 2011, the day when
the Nationalization Decree was adopted (an agreement which makes it
unnecessary for the Tribunal to address the thorny issue of the appropriate
date for calculation in unlawful expropriations);

- The second that the “genuine value”, to which Art. VII refers, equates with
the traditional concept of “fair market value”, defined as the*”?

“price that a willing buyer would buy given goods at and the price at which a
willing seller would sell it at on the condition that none of the two parties [is]
under any kind of duress and that both parties have good information about all
relevant circumstances involved in the purchase”.

In order to establish the fair market value of Rusoro’s investment, the Tribunal will
proceed as follows: it will first make a short introduction to the international gold
market and the value of gold producing companies (1.), and then it will establish

- the amount actually invested by Rusoro in Venezuela, at historic prices (2.),
and revalued in accordance with the evolution of gold producing companies

(3.)
- the book value of such investment (4.),
- Rusoro’s market capitalization (5.), and
- the valuation made by Claimant’s expert (6.).

Having made this analysis, the Tribunal will be in a position to present its own
valuation of the fair market value of Rusoro’s Venezuelan enterprise as of 16
September 2011, taking into consideration Venezuela’s arguments that there was
contributory fault and that Rusoro overpaid for worthless investments (7.).

2k

Before doing so, it is important to underline two characteristics which are specific
to Rusoro, and which have a significant impact on its enterprise value:

The first is that Rusoro is a corporation listed on the TSX Toronto Stock Exchange
— a respected and well regulated market specializing in the listing and trading of
mining companies. The fact that Rusoro is listed implies not only that it has an open
number of shareholders (there being no single person who exercises control), but
also that it is subject to reinforced rules regarding accounting and disclosure:

 

- its accounts, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards, are audited (by Grant Thornton, a respected auditing company),

- it must provide relevant information to the market on a regular (at least
quarterly) b:

 

- and any disclosure of a mineral project must conform to the official standards
set forth in National Instrument 43-101 [NI 43-101”], a demanding standard
which requires an extensive prospectus, with very detailed information,
prepared by a “Qualified Person”, who must accept responsibility for its
content’.

The second is that Rusoro’s enterprise was limited to the exploration, mining and
production of gold in one single country, Venezuela: at the time of the

ets were three gold producing projects in
sl and more than ten

653. And gold is indeed a very special commodity (to the extent that President Chavez
personally wrote “jOro, oro, oro!” beneath his signature on the Nationalization
Decree). Since times immemorial gold not only serves as a currency, it is also an
investment asset, appreciated by investors especially in times of uncertainty. Gold
is also an industrial commodity, used as a fundamental input not only in the
jewellery industry but also in other sectors. The backside is that gold prices are
highly volatile, with huge swings in value.

   

1. THE PRICE OF GOLD AND THE VALUE OF GOLD MI

 

1G COMPANIES

654. The valuation of any enterprise presents the challenge of estimating its capacity to
generate future cash flows. In most enterprises, the sales price of its products or
services can be predicted with a minimum of certainty; in the case of gold producing
enterprises, however, an additional layer of unpredictability, an “unknown
unknown” is added: the volatility of sales prices and the uncertainty about the level
of revenue which the enterprise will be able to generate.

 

655. The most significant sources of demand for gold are jewellery and industry, which
make up 61% of total demand, while retail investors represent 28%; the supply is
satisfied for 2/3 by mine production and for the rest by recycling**. As the
following figure shows, since 1970’s gold prices (measured in constant 2012 USD)
ranged between USD 200 to USD 600 per oz., with two exceptional spikes:

- The first occurred in 1979-1980, when prices reached USD 1700/oz., but then
dropped quickly;

- The second happened in 2011, when prices peaked on August 22, 2011 (pro
memoria: less than one month before the expropriation) at USD 1,838/0z.5°

501 “Mineral Reserves are those parts of Mineral Resources which, after the application of all mining factors,
result in an estimated tonnage and grade which, in the opinion of the Qualified Person(s) making the
estimates, is the basis of an economically viable project after taking account of all relevant processing,
metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environment, socio-economic and government factor”. See CIM
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves — Definition and Guidelines, 20 August 2000, p. 7. (Doc.
NAV-34)

502 “Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized organic
material in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has
reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and
continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence
and knowledge”. CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves — Definition and Guidelines, 20

Gold pri ind the value of gold companies

657. The value of gold mining companies and projects is closely correlated with the price
of gold: the higher the price of the commodity, the higher the value of gold
producing enterprises (and vice versa). The increased valuation of companies,
however, lags the rises in gold prices, because taxes on profits and royalties levied
by host States increase more than proportionally. The relationship and the lag can
be seen in this figure, which shows the evolution of the price of gold vis-a-vis the
valuation of gold companies (measured by the S&P-TSX Global Gold Index):

658. Venezuela decided to expropriate Rusoro’s investments in Venezuela on 16
September 2011, less than one month after gold reached its all-time peak of USD
1,838/o0z. The value of gold companies is, as the above figure shows, closely related
to the price of gold. This implies that (ceteris paribus) on the date of expropriation
the value of Rusoro must have been at (or very close to) its historic maximum.

660. In accordance with Mr. Kaczmarek’s analysis, the total acquisition costs incurred
by Rusoro from 2006 — 2008 amount to USD 629.3 million. Additionally, Rusoro
spent USD 163.9 million in plant and equipment, mineral property and funding for

operating losses, making a total of USD 793.1 million.

Dr. Burrows’ objections

661. Dr. Burrows, Respondent’s expert, disagrees with this valuation; his numbers are

significantly different:

662. There are fundamentally three reasons for Dr. Burrows’ differing opinion™:

- First, he does not account for the value of the shares that Rusoro issued to pay
for some of its investments (Agapov, Mena, Gold Fields and Hecla); for
example, Dr. Burrows concludes that Rusoro invested USD 206 million in
the Gold Fields acquisition, disregarding the USD 321 million in Rusoro
stock that additionally formed part of the consideration;

- Second, he puts a negative value to the investment in Mena, because the
acquired company had a positive net cash position;

- Third, he excludes operating losses incurred from the computation of
investment.

. The Tribunal

- agrees with Dr. Burrows’ third objection (losses as such cannot be considered
investments, only the capital contributions to cover losses can be considered
investments); Navigant erroneously considered the mere funding of operating
losses as an investment; if these losses are excluded, the additional investment
in Mr. Kaczmarek’s table is reduced from USD 163.9 million to USD 145
million>", bringing the total investment to USD 774.3 million®!';

- rejects Dr. Burrows’ second objection (the proposition that the acquisition of
Mena, in which Rusoro delivered shares in an amount of USD 111 million,
in fact implies a “negative investment” of almost USD 60 million is difficult
to accept);

- and does not share, but has a certain understanding for the first objection.

This

 

rst objection in fact requires a more careful evaluation.
Was there overvaluation?

Dr. Burrows’ main argument to support his first objection is that the Rusoro shares,
delivered as consideration for the acquisitions, were overvalued, and that the total
consideration agreed upon between Rusoro and the sellers (which included cash
and shares) significantly exceeded the real value of the acquired assets.

Venezuela has expressed the same idea in more forceful term>!?:

“The consideration for the Mena transaction was 100% Rusoro stock and
warrants. The cash for the Gold Fields transaction was extracted from Mena
and additional sale of Rusoro stock. Thus the Agapovs themselves invested
nothing in these acquisitions. They simply issued more Rusoro stock”

As evidence of this alleged overvaluation, Dr. Burrows explains that the share price
of Rusoro dropped between the announcement date and the closing date of the Gold

510 Doc, H-9, second table excluding line “Operating losses”, totaling USD 18.9 million.

511 Doc. H-9: USD 629.3 million for the acquisitions plus USD 145 million for plant and equipment and
mineral property costs.

Fields transaction by 33%, and that after the closing date, the share price continued
to decline, suggesting that investors considered that there was an overpayment, and
that the stock market valued the acquisition at USD 160 to 230 million — which
equates with the cash portion of the transaction*!>.

There are a number of inconsistencies with Dr. Burrows’ and Venezuela’s
argument:

(i) The first is that the facts do not quite fit Dr. Burrows’ account: when the Gold
Fields tran: ion was announced on 11 October 2007, Rusoro’s share price was
USD 2.5; after an initial fall, the price recovered, and towards the end of the month
reached a peak in excess of USD 2.5; thereafter a decline set in and by December
the price had dropped below USD 1.574.

There is no evidence in the file that this decline wa sed by an overvaluation of
the Gold Fields acquisition — other reasons (e.g. increase in the Venezuelan country
risk) could also have been at play; Dr. Burrows himself has provided the following
figure*'5, which shows that, shortly after the Gold Fields acquisition, Venezuela’s
sovereign bond spread started to rise (caused by the fall in oil prices).

Rusoro was a single country gold producing company: any increase in the
Venezuela country risk must have produced a significant reduction in its share
price.

Furthermore, there is no evidence that the decline in Rusoro’s share price, which
occurred between announcement and execution of the Gold Fields deal, was
definitive. To the contrary, the evidence shows that the share price of Rusoro
recovered, and as Dr. Burrows himself shows>!®, Rusoro reached its all-time highest
market capitalization one year later in September 2008 (at approximately USD 750
million).

(ii) The second problem is that Dr. Burrows totally disregards the fact that Rusoro
is a listed company and that its board of directors has a fiduciary duty towards its
existing shareholders. If a board decides to issue new stock, against undervalued
consideration, existing shareholders are diluted and suffer a loss in the value of their
investment. There is no evidence in the file that any of the historic shareholders of
Rusoro ever voiced any protest or submitted any claim for this reason.

 

(iii) Third, the Tribunal does not concur with Venezuela’s argument that the
Agapovs “invested nothing” and “simply issued more Rusoro stock”.

An initial point of disagreement is that the investor was of course Rusoro, a listed
company with many shareholders, not the Agapovs.

But more importantly, Venezuela’s argument is untenable from a legal and financial
point of view: it totally disregards a basic principle of company law and corporate
finance, the fact that the issuance of new shares does affect existing shareholders’
rights and values. If the new shareholders do not pay in the appropriate
consideration, the value of the shares in the hands of the existing shareholders will
be diluted, and wealth will pass — for free — from old shareholders to new

shareholders. The Agapovs and the other shareholders could not “simply issue more
Rusoro stock”: had they issued stock against insufficient consideration, they would
have been cutting themselves in their own (financial) finger.

A caveat by the Tribunal

That said, the Tribunal concurs with Dr. Burrows’ underlying assumption that in
corporate acquisitions there are differences in the quality of the consideration,
depending on whether payment is made in cash or in shares. In share transactions a
seller wishing to monetarize the proceeds has to dispose of the securities received
—a procedure which implies risks (which increase if there is a lock-in period) and
costs; while in a cash transaction these risks and costs of course disappear. This
would justify a small adjustment downwards of the portion of the consideration
expressed in shares — but never its total exclusion, as advocated by Dr. Burrows.

    

Summing up, the Tribunal concludes that Rusoro effectively made substantial
investments in Venezuela of USD 774.3 million:

 

n

- it made five corporate acquisitions, for a total consideration of USD 629.3
million, of which a portion was paid for in cash (which Dr. Burrows calculates
at approximately USD 237 million®!’) and the rest (of approximately USD
400 million) in its own shares; and

- additionally it made further investments in property plant and equipment of
approximately USD 145 million®!*.

RUSORO’S INVESTMENT ADJUSTED

The Tribunal has already explained*! that the value of gold mining companies
(expressed through the S&P/TSX Global Index [the “Index’]) is closely related,
albeit with a lag, to the price of gold. This implies that if gold prices rise, the value
of a gold producer will also increase — assuming that all other factors which
influence value remain unchanged.

 

Rusoro made its five acquisitions in Venezuela at a time when gold prices and
consequently also the overall valuation of gold mining companies were (relatively)
low, but had already started to rise. In fact, the Index, which represents the value of
gold mining companies, stood at 284 at the time of the Agapov acquisition, and
reached 347 by the time of the Hecla purchase**°. When Rusoro suffered
expropriation in September 201 1, the Index had risen to 473.5°?! (and the gold price
had risen in an even higher proportion — see figures in pa 654 and 657 above).

 

Claimant’s expert has performed a calculation*”’, increasing the consideration paid
in the five acquisitions (including cash and shares) in the same proportion as the

57 CRAT at 49.

518 Tn this item, CRA provides a higher figure (USD 159.4 million) than Navigant (USD 145 million).

rise of the Index between the date of each transaction and the date of expropriation.
This drives the amount invested from USD 774.3 million (Mr. Kaczmarek’s
calculation, corrected by the Tribunal to exclude operating losses) to USD 1,128.7

682. In other words: Rusoro initially invested some USD 774.3 million in its Venezuelan
enterprise; it did so at a time of low (but rising) gold prices and gold company
valuations. Hindsight shows that the timing of Rusoro’s investment was excellent.
Gold prices and consequently also gold company valuations rose while it held its
investment. Venezuela chose to expropriate at the time when gold prices and gold
company values had reached their peak. Ceteris paribus, i.e. assuming no change
whatsoever in micro- or macro-economic conditions, the mere evolution of the gold
price, which significantly increased during the time between investment and
expropriation, would have led the value of the investment to increase to more than
USD 1,128.7 million.

 

4. ‘THE BOOK VALUE OF RUSORO’S INVESTMENT.

683. In the quarterly accounts as of 30 September 2011, Rusoro was carrying its
Venezuelan enterprise at a gross book value of USD 959 million, comprised of°”*4

- USD 674 million property, plant and equipment, and

- USD 285 million for mineral properties.

54 Doc. NAV-23 — Rusoro Q 3 2011 Quarterly Report, p. 13-14.

150

The corresponding depreciation was USD 51 million, leading to a net book value
of USD 908 million. Book value of assets is higher than amounts invested, because
the acquisitions included assets and liabilities.

 

684. Rusoro reported the gross and net book values of its investments not only in its
quarterly reports but also in its audited annual financial statements. The annual
reports were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards [“IFRS”], were audited by Grant Thornton, Rusoro’s auditor, and were
publicly disclosed and filed with the Canadian securities regulator. The 2010 annual
report (the one preceding the Q 3 2011 quarterly report) had been approved by the

auditors with a clean opinion*>.

 

685. IFRS required Rusoro to impair its assets, reducing the book value, if it believed
that their “fair value’52° was lower than book value. In fact, in 2010 Rusoro had
made an impairment of USD 11 million to the value of its mineral properties**’.
Rusoro’s auditor was required to verify this periodic “fair value” analysis. In its
2010 opinion Grant Thornton does not mention any disagreement with the
impairment policy and practice adopted by the company.

The relevance of book value

686. Claimant says that the book value of the expropriated assets, in addition to being a
useful benchmark, should act as a floor for the assessment of damage in this case*?8,
especially, because the Nationalization Decree specifically provided for book value
to be paid as compensation*”’.

687. Respondent disagrees*”.

688. It first requests that the Tribunal ignore any reference to Rusoro’s book value,
because “Venezuela had no opportunity to brief or provide expert analysis”>*!,

Claimant having brought up the issue for the first time in the Hearing***.

689. The argument is misguided, because in the valuation of any expropriated enterprise
its book value is by nature one of the relevant elements. The Nationalization Decree
itself provides that the compensation paid should equate with the book value of the
expropriated assets. Furthermore, the data on which the calculation of book value
relies are the accounts of Rusoro, and these were available to the Bolivarian

Republic at all times (and additionally were submitted into the file by Navigant).
Venezuela and its experts had every opportunity to argue the relevance of book
value. And in fact they did: Respondent devotes three pages of its PHB to this
matter},

Second, the Republic submits that Rusoro’s book value was created by allocating
“inflated paper purchase consideration” over assets that in fact had little value. It
adds that®>

“as of the end of 2007, only US$ 115 million of PP&E was actual machinery,
facilities, vehicles or other tangible assets; the remainder was Rusoro’s
allocation of its purchase price to mining properties”.

 

 

The Tribunal does not share the argument. It is a second rendering of the reasoning
that consideration expressed in own shares is worthless. The Tribunal has already
rejected this proposition®”®.

(The Tribunal takes objection to Respondent’s reference to “USD 115 million of
PP&E”. What Venezuela is quoting is the 2007 figure; what is being discussed here
are 2011 values, because it is in 2011 when Rusoro was expropriated. The reference
to 2007 is misleading. The correct figure for 2011 is USD 674 million*”).

 

. Third, Respondent says that the difference between the USD 900 million book value

and Rusoro’s market capitalization dramatically increased, the market value falling
to USD 106.8 million just before the announcement of the expropriation**’.

The Tribunal does not share this reasoning.

From a methodological standpoint, the Republic’s comparison of book value and
market capitalization is inapposite. It compares apples with oranges, because book
value is unaffected by corporate leverage, while market capitalization is.

Further to this, the price of a Rusoro share in the Toronto stock market (and
consequently Rusoro’s market capitalization) was affected by the 2009 and 2010
Measures, and by the general increase in the perceived political risk affecting the
Bolivarian Republic (as shown by the fact that Venezuela’s sovereign bond spread
increased six fold, from approximately 2% to 12%, between 2007 and 201 15°). The
fact that, because of these exogenous reasons, the market price of Rusoro’s share
collapsed, did not impact the book value of Rusoro’s assets. The share price of listed
companies is subject to the volatility of the stock market; swings in share prices,
however, do not result in an obligation to impair the book value of their assets.

The record shows that in 2010 Rusoro decided to make an impairment of USD 11
million to the value of its mineral properties*!°. There is no evidence that the auditor
disagreed with this determination; neither has evidence been marshalled to prove
that the applicable IFRS standards required additional impairments.

Fifth, the Bolivarian Republic argues that Gold Fields wrote down the value of its
Rusoro stock almost immediately — and that this should have led to an impairment
of Rusoro’s book value.

The precise figures of the write down are somewhat in doubt. The Republic’s
expert, Mr. Brim, refers to a write down to USD 168 million in seven months™!,
while in the R-PHB the figure quoted is USD 165.7 million (presumably at the end

of Q 3 2008)*.
Be that as it may, the argument is unconvincing.

One thing is the price in the Toronto Stock Exchange of the Rusoro share, and
another the book value of Rusoro’s assets in the annual accounts. As has already
been explained, stock prices are influenced by exogenous factors, which have no
impact on the accounting valuations of the listed company. The price of a Rusoro
share in the Toronto stock market fell sharply — and when that happened, Gold
Fields, also a listed company, was forced by the applicable accounting standards to
impair the value attributed to the Rusoro shares it held. But there was no impact on
Rusoro’s book value, which is accounted for applying different standards.

Sixth, the Bolivarian Republic finally alleges that Rusoro “wrongly ignores USD
267.8 million in future tax liabilities” in arriving at its book value**?, Respondent
does not provide any further explanation or support for this argument, which seems
to have been submitted for the first time in its PHB.

3. Respondent does not explain where the USD 267.8 million figure comes from. The

Tribunal has reviewed Rusoro’s accounts trying to find an explanation. The figure
does not arise from the Q 3 2011 ounts (which are the relevant ones). because
there the number for future tax liabi s USD 198.7 million+. The figure seems
to come from the 2008 accounts (which are irrelevant for the determination of the
book value on the date of expropriation — September 2011)*4.

   

In the 2010 annual accounts there is a specific note [17 (b)] which relates to this
issue — but the amount again is different. The relevant part of the Note reads as
follows™*:

“The future income tax liability of $338,973 (December 31, 2009: $264,405)
substantially relates to the excess of the fair value of the assets acquired in
previous acquisitions over their tax costs which have been substantially
allocated to property, plant and equipment and mineral properties. As the
future amortization of these assets for accounting purposes will exceed the
equivalent tax deduction, the Company recorded the future income tax
liability relating to these temporary differences at the time of the acquisitions.
As the related assets are amortized the future income tax liability will decrease
with an offsetting recovery of future income taxes in the consolidated
statement of operations.” [Amounts in thousands of USD]

 

The Note explains that the future income tax liability arises because Rusoro has
bought assets at fair value, which exceeded the amortizable tax costs of such assets.
Future accounting amortizations will be higher than the tax deductible
amortizations, and this may give rise to an income tax liability. Whether this future
tax liability will or not arise is uncertain. Its real effect is also unclear, since it may
also give rise to an offsetting recovery in the statement of operations.

 

 

The Republic’s request, that USD 267.8 million in future tax liabilities be deducted
from Rusoro’s book value, cannot succeed,

- because the figure seems to relate to 2008, and is irrelevant for the calculation
of book value in 2011, and

- because Respondent has not provided any reason or support justifying why
this deduction should be performed.

 
  

Summing up, the Tribunal concludes that the net book value of Rusoro’s
of 30 September 2011 (the last day of the quarter in which the expropri:
place), amounted to USD 908 million.

RUSORO’S MARKET CAPITALIZATION
The market capitalization of a listed company (calculated by multiplying the market
price per share by the number of outstanding shares) represents the valuation given

by the market to the company’s equity. Rusoro’s market capitalization from
November 2006 through November 2011 is shown in this figure:

—— Rusoro Mining Market Capitalization

The figure indicates that Rusoro’s market capitalization increased following the
Gold Fields acquisition at the end of November 2007, reaching a peak of USD 752.4
million 28 February 2008**7.

It is important to underline that in 2008, before Venezuela adopted the 2009 and
2010 Measures and its political risk escalated, the stock market valued the equity
of Rusoro at USD 750 million.

From a financial point of view market capitalization of a listed company does not
equate with its enterprise value. To calculate the enterprise value it is necessary to
add (or detract) the outstanding net debt to this figure. Navigant has provided the
daily calculation of Rusoro’s enterprise value, performed by Bloomberg™*. For 28
February 2008, the enterprise value was USD 700.6 million (indicating that net debt
was a negative amount, due to Rusoro’s positive cash position).

This implies that in the year 2008 the market at one point valued Rusoro’s
Venezuelan enterprise at some USD 700 million.

Then the value started to decline rapidly, and the trend continued until market
capitalization plummeted to USD 106.8 million on 5 August 2011, the day before
President Chavez announced that Venezuela would nationalize the gold mining
industry**? (which corresponded to an enterprise value of USD 125.6 million — by
then Rusoro’s net debt was positive*°).

This protracted decline came during a period of rising gold prices and a significant
increase in the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index (which represents the global value of
gold mining companies). Rusoro’s reduced market capitalization does not reflect
the fundamental economics and value of gold mines, but rather the political
uncertainty created by the 2009 and 2010 Measures and the increase of the political
country risk associated with the Bolivarian Republic (whose sovereign bond spread
jumped from 2% to 12% between 2007 and 20115*!).

THE VALUATION OF RUSORO PROPOSED BY CLAIMANT’S EXPERT

Navigant, Claimant’s expert, values Rusoro’s Venezuelan enterprise using a
weighted average of three different methods**:

- Comparable publicly traded companies: USD 2.49 billion [the “CPTC
Valuation”)

- Comparable transactions: USD 2.59 billion [the “CT Valuation”];
- Discounted Cash Flow: USD 2.03 billion [the “DCF Valuation”].

Mr. Kaczmarek weighted these results in accordance with an assessment of the
robustness of the available data (50% CPCT Valuation, 30% DCF Valuation, 20%
CT Valuation) and initially arrived at a figure of USD 2.37 billion. It later adjusted
this figure to USD 2.23 billion, which in his opinion reflects the fair market value

of the expropriated assets*>>.

 

The Tribunal will first provide some additional detail of Navigant’s valuation (A.),
and it will then summarize Respondent’s objections (B.).

A. Navigant’s valuation

Navigant in fact performs three different valuations of Rusoro’s enterprise, using
three different methods.

CPCT Valuation

The CPTC Valuation is based on 211 potentially comparable gold mining
companies that were publicly traded on the valuation date. Navigant subsequently
reduces this list to six companies, chosen for their similarity to Rusoro in certain
key respects such as total resources, proportion of resources identified as reserves,
annual production and average costs. Each company is then assigned a weight based
upon how comparable it is with Rusoro, and for each company Navigant calculates
the ratio between its enterprise value and its total amount in oz. of resources and
reserves. The result is shown in the following table*™*:

   
     

 

55! CRA II, Figure 5; see para 670 supra.

53 Doc. H-8 at 25; the amount claimed by Rusoro in its PHB is USD 2.23 billion, because of a reduction
in the updated resource estimate for the Increible 6 project — see C PHB at fn. 390.

720. The table shows that each oz. of gold in reserves and resources held by the six
comparable companies had a weighted average value of 151 USD/oz.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

721. Then Navigant resorts to the total gold reserves and resources held by Rusoro:>°°:

722. Since Rusoro has 16,525,550 oz. of gold reserves and resources, Navigant
multiplies this figure by 151, resulting in Rusoro’s implied enterprise value:
USD 2,49 billion.

CT Valuation

For the CT Valuation Navigant first divides Rusoro’s properties in production>°
and pre-production projects**’.

Thereafter Navigant identifies 108 transactions that were comparable to Rusoro’s
production and pre-production gold mine projects. The expert then narrows the list
to the four production projects and four pre-production projects most comparable
to Rusoro’s projects, using similar criteria to those used in the CPCT Valuation. For
each transaction Navigant calculates the ratio between enterprise value and total
resources and then it obtains a weighted average, applying the weightings it finds
most appropriate after a qualitative and quantitative review. The results for
production projects and pre-production projects are shown in these tables:

Weighted Average: 65.03

 

The calculation of Rusoro’s value again is very straightforward: since Rusoro’s
three production projects contain 14.34 million oz. of reserves and resources**,
multiplying this figure by USD 170.63/oz. results in an enterprise value of USD
2.45 billion®°. The equivalent calculation for the pre-production projects is 2.19

million oz. of reserves and resources*®, multiplied by USD 65.03/oz., resulting in
an enterprise value of USD 142.3 million.

726. The sum of the enterprise value for Rusoro’s production and the pre-production

projects (USD 2.45 billion plus USD 142.3 million) results in a total CT Valuation
of USD 2.59 billion.

The so-called DCF Valuation

727. The so-called DCF Valuation in fact does not value the totality of the assets using

a DCF approach: only the three mining projects with defined reserves*°! (Choco
10/Increible 6, SREP and Isidora) are actually valued calculating the future cash
flows they will generate*®. The remaining additional resources*® (contained in
producing and pre-producing projects) are valued applying the CT approach; and
for the two exploration projects Navigant resorts to the cost approach. The
aggregate of the three valuations results in Rusoro’s enterprise value.

 

(i) The DCF leg

728. The fundamental component of the cash flow projections used in the DCF leg of

the total valuation are
- The amount of gold that Rusoro would have produced and sold,
- The price at which Rusoro would have sold its gold and

- The discount rate to be applied.

729. Navigant relies on the mining plans contained in the NI 43-101 Report prepared by

Micon International Limited, an independent expert, for the “Expansion of gold
production at Choco 10 and Increible 6° [the “Micon Report I”]; on Micon’s
Technical Report for Isidora*® [the “Micon Report II] and on Whillans’ NI 43-
101 pre-feasibility study for SREP [the “Whillans Report”}°°. Navigant’s
assumptions regarding production are based on these reports**”.

730. One of the difficulties in the modelling of gold mines is to project how gold prices

will evolve. Navigant bases its model on gold futures contracts. Such contracts were
available through 2016, and Navigant uses the prices which result from these

agreements. From 2017 Navigant assumes a steady gold price in nominal terms*°*.

Navigant does not include any discount on gold prices to reflect obligatory sales in
the domestic market™.

  

. The appropriate weighted average cost of capital [“WACC’] rate, in accordance

with Navigant’s opinion, is 11.53%, incorporating a country risk premium of
1.50%°.

(ii) The CT leg

. The DCF method is only applied to the three producing projects with reserves. For

the remaining resources contained in producing and pre-producing projects, the
valuation is not based on DCF, but rather on the CT methodology. As already seen,
Navigant concludes that Rusoro’s additional pre-producing resources should be
valued at USD 65.03/0z. Applying this figure to Rusoro’s oz. of resources — 11.282
million®’! — results in an additional value of USD 733.6 million>”*.

The addition of

- the valuation of the three producing projects, actually made with DCF
approach, which amounts to USD 1.29 billion plus

- the valuation of Rusoro’s additional resources, made with CT Valuation
approach, which amounts to USD 733.6 million plus

- the cost value of two exploration projects, which amounts to USD 7.2 million

all together result in the total so-called DCF Valuation of USD 2.03 billion.

2k

Summing up, Navigant weighs these results (50% CPCT Valuation, 20% DCF
Valuation, 30% CT Valuation) to arrive at a figure of USD 2.23 billion, which
reflects the fair market value of the expropriated assets.

B. Venezuela’s rejection of the Navigant valuation

The Bolivarian Republic and its expert are in total disagreement with Mr.
Kaczmarek’s valuation of the expropriated assets.

First, Respondent says that in its DCF analysis Navigant only relied on the Micon
and Whillans Reports, and complains that Rusoro failed to provide the actual
studies and block models upon which these NI 43-101 Reports were based.
Venezuela adds that the Micon Report I in fact is a litigation document and that the
Whillans Report is at the less reliable pre-feasibility level*”*.

 

Second, Venezuela argues that there are no historical data on operations to verify
Navigant’s valuation.

More than 80% of the value that Navigant attributes to the Choco 10 expansion
comes from the completely unexploited VBK and Increible 6 deposits. The pits and
aging plant Rusoro inherited from Gold Fields make up less than 20% of the value
attributed by Navigant>’>. The expansion project requires new financing in an
amount of USD 310.8 million, to quadruple processing capacity, to mine seven

times more material and it required an upgrade of the mill from a 2,000 to a 11,000
kilowatt motor*”®.

Third, Respondent underlines that only 63% of Navigant’s DCF Valuation actually
involves discounted cash flows from the three production projects. The remainder
is comprised of valuations based on CT methodology and cost approach. The
Tribunal should ignore 37% - USD 720 million — of Navigant’s DCF Valuation*”’.

Fourth, the Republic says that Rusoro never sold gold at international spot prices in
its operational history. The NI 43-101 Reports relied upon by Rusoro contain a
discount to the international gold price — including the Micon Report with a 20.31%
discount®’*. Additionally, Respondent disagrees with Navigant’s approach for
calculating gold prices on the basis of futures, instead supporting CRA’s
methodology of using a survey of the prevailing views of industry participants on
the valuation date*”.

. (In its PHB, Rusoro submits counter-arguments: CRA’s “consensus view” is biased

and flawed, and Dr. Burrows has accepted the use of futures in other reports®°.)

. Fifth, Venezuela notes that only El Placer was held by Rusoro as a concession; the

rest of the Mining Rights for which compensation is being sought are based on CVG
Contracts. Rusoro had no right to the renewal of the concession or of the CVG
Contracts. Navigant inappropriately attributes value to reserves and resources that
could only be mined after the concession or leases will have ended, by simply
assuming the renewal of the Mining Rights. The possibility of a renewal of the
Mining Rights must be excluded, because Minister Alvarez had announced in 2006
a policy of no more conces

  

(In its PHB, Claimant counters Venezuela’s argument that Mining Rights will not
be renewed, saying that Rusoro was always in good standing, that in a counter-
factual scenario Venezuela’s Bolivarian policies must be excluded and that as a
matter of law the government did not have unfettered discretion to reject
renewal**,)

Sixth, Venezuela makes a number of specific objections to Navigant’s DCF
calculations (including that a high country risk of 16.46% is justified°*? and that the
adjustments to the mine plan favoured by Venezuela’s expert BBA should be
included in the calculations***).

 

Seventh, the Republic says that the OJ European tribunal rejected using CPCT or
CT valuations as a primary method of valuation and relegated them to a secondary

“sanity check” role**>, Furthermore, Navigant’s selection of public traded
companies and transactions are not comparable to Rusoro, because they differ
substantially with respect to location, cost of capital, price realization, operating
costs, stage of production and quality of resource base, among other factors***,

747. The filters applied by Navigant resulted in comparables that were not even
reasonably and justifiably similar to each other®*’. Navigant’s selected filters
produce comparables that are clearly more valuable than Rusoro.

748. It is undisputed that resources are less valuable than reserves. 66% of the

mineralization for which Rusoro claims value falls into the category of resources,
as shown in the figure below>**:

749. Navigant’s comparables analysis effectively attributes inferred resources a value
equal to reserves, by basing valuation on total ounces present in a deposit,
regardless of geological classification, which is fundamentally wrong*®. Yet
Navigant made no adjustments to reflect Rusoro’s much lower reserves and higher
resources in comparison to its comparables*”’.

(In its PHB, Claimant submits that the use of market approaches is very common,
and that the CIMVal Guidelines, which provide the market standard for valuing
mineral assets in Canada affirm the widespread application of market approaches
in mining valuations. Market approaches are of particular utility in the valuation of
gold resources which are less amenable to DCF analysis but undisputedly have
value*?!.Complete similarity between Rusoro and its comparables is unnec
and impractical — the valuation exercise involves finding adequately s
projects, and those identified by Navigant effectively are so°°.)

  

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

The Tribunal is tasked with establishing the “genuine value” (in the terminology of
Article VII of the BIT) of Rusoro’s expropriated investment. Both parties agree,
and the Tribunal accepts, that the genuine value is equivalent to the fair market
value of the enterprise, i.e. the price at which a willing buyer would buy, and a
willing seller would sell, no party being under any type of duress and both parties
having good information about all relevant circumstances involved in the

purchase>"?.

 

Assessment of fair market value

 

The calculation which the Tribunal must perform is a hypothetical exercise: in real
life, in September 2011 no buyer having good information about the gold sector in
Venezuela would have been prepared to buy a gold producing enterprise in that
country for a fair price.

. Gold is a very special commodity, intimately linked to the financial sovereignty of

nations, and the value of gold companies is affected by the intensity of the
regulatory measures adopted by host states.

At the time of expropriation, the regulatory intensity in Venezuela was significant
indeed: the Bolivarian authorities had already issued the 2009 and then the 2010
Measures, signalling their readiness to impose severe restrictions on the export of
gold produced in Venezuela and subjecting gold to a strict exchange control regime.
These measures, plus the increasing political risk associated with investments in
Venezuela (evidenced by a dramatic increase in Venezuela’s bond spread>™*) would
have a chilling effect on any prospective purchaser.

 

The Tribunal must thus calculate the fair market value of an enterprise which no
well-informed purchaser would buy, at a fair price.

The BIT provides the Tribunal with some guidance on how to solve this apparently
inextricable riddle: it foresees that the value of the expropriated asset should be
established at the time “immediately before the expropriation or at the time the
proposed expropriation became public knowledge”. The purpose of this rule is to
avoid that the price of the asset becomes contaminated by the information

originating from the host State. The fair market value which the State must pay is
that which an innocent, uninformed third party would pay, having no knowledge of
the State’s pre-expropriation (but post-investment) policy towards the expropriated
company and its sector.

There is a second argument, specific to this case: the Tribunal has already concluded
that the intensification of the gold export restrictions contained in the 2010
Measures are incompatible with the Treaty. Consequently, the effect of the
increased export restrictions must be excluded from the valuation of Rusoro’s
enterprise — otherwise the State would be deriving advantage from its own wrong>”>.

Use of DCF valuations

Valuations based on the DCF method have become usual in investment arbitrations,
whenever the fair market value of an enterprise must be established. The Tribunal
agrees that, where the circumstances for its use are appropriate, forward looking
DCF has advantages over other, more backwards looking valuation methods.

DCF, however, cannot be applied to all types of circumstances, and while in certain
enterprises it returns meaningful valuations, in other cases it is inappropriate. DCF
works properly if all, or at least a significant part, of the following criteria are
met5%

- The enterprise has an established historical record of financial performance;

- There are reliable projections of its future cash flow, ideally in the form of a
detailed business plan adopted in tempore insuspecto, prepared by the
company’s officers and verified by an impartial expert;

- The price at which the enterprise will be able to sell its products or services
can be determined with reasonable certainty;

- The business plan can be financed with self-generated cash, or, if additional
cash is required, there must be no uncertainty regarding the availability of
financing;

 

- It is possible to calculate a meaningful WACC, including a reasonable
country risk premium, which fairly represents the political risk in the host
country;

- The enterprise is active in a sector with low regulatory pressure, or, if the
regulatory pressure is high, its scope and effects must be predictable: it should
be possible to establish the impact of regulation on future cash flows with a
minimum of certainty.

DCF is not a friars’ balm which cures all ailments. It is simply a financial technique,
in which an expert is able to estimate with reasonable certainty a number of future
parameters (income, expenses, investments), and then discount the net income at an

766.

appropriate rate. If the estimation of those parameters is incorrect, the results will
not represent the actual fair market value of the enterprise. Small adjustments in the
estimation can yield significant divergences in the results. For this reason,
valuations made through a DCF analysis must in any case be subjected to a “sanity
check” against other valuation methodologies*””.

2k

Having established these general principles, the Tribunal must now address the
precise quantification of the “genuine value” of Rusoro’s Venezuelan enterp! In
order to do so, the Tribunal will first summarize the various alternative valuations
which are in the record (A.), will then exclude the application of certain valuations
(B.) and will use the remaining valuations to establish the “genuine value” of the
expropriated assets (C.). Finally the Tribunal will assess Respondent’s additional
defences (D.)

 

 
    

A. Valuations in the record

. The Tribunal has at its disposal the following six valuations:

. First, Rusoro made five corporate acquisitions, for a total consideration of USD 630

million, of which a portion was paid for in cash and the rest in its own shares, and
it made further investments in property plant and equipment of approximately USD
145 million. Rusoro consequently made an investment in Venezuela of USD 774.3
million — a sum which may be slightly inflated by the use of own shares as a portion
of the consideration [the “Investment Valuation”]°°’.

Second, when Rusoro initially invested some USD 774.3 million in its Venezuelan
enterprise, it did so at a time of low (but rising) gold prices and gold company
valuations. The timing of Rusoro’s investment was prescient: gold prices and
consequently also gold company valuations rose while Claimant held its
investment. Venezuela chose to expropriate at the time when gold prices and gold
company values had reached their peak. Ceteris paribus, i.e. assuming no change
whatsoever in micro- or macro-economic conditions, the mere evolution of the gold
price, which significantly increased during the time between investment and
expropriation, would have led the value of the investment to increase to more than
USD 1,128.7 million [the “Adjusted Investment Valuation”}>”’.

 

This sum derives from the USD 774.3 million amount invested, and may also be
slightly inflated by the use of own shares as consideration.

Third, the net book value of Rusoro’s assets, as of 30 September 2011 (the last day
of the quarter in which the expropriation took place), amounted to USD 908 million
[the “Book Valuation”).

772.

Fourth and fifth, Rusoro’s market capitalization can also be used to establish its
enterprise value.

In mid-2008, before Venezuela adopted the 2009 and 2010 Measures and its
political risk escalated, the stock market valued the equity of Rusoro at USD 752.4
million, which after exclusion of debt net resulted in an enterprise value of
approximately USD 700.6 million [the “Maximum Market Valuation’).

 

The market capitalization started to declined rapidly, and plummeted to USD 97.5
million on 5 August 2011, the day before President Chavez announced that
Venezuela would nationalize the gold mining industry. To this amount the net debt
should be added, resulting in a “Final Market Valuation” of approximately USD
125.6 million.

Sixth, Mr. Kaczmarek, Claimant’s expert, performed a valuation of Rusoro’s
enterprise, based fundamentally on a comparables method (and only to a limited
extend on DCF). He arrived at a figure of USD 2.23 billion, which in his opinion
reflects the fair market value of the expropriated assets [the “Navigant
Valuation”).

B. _ Exclusion of certain valuations

The Tribunal finds that, for different reasons, three of the six valuations on record
should not be taken into consideration for establishing the “genuine value” of the
expropriated assets:

a. The Investment Valuation.

Under certain conditions, the historic amounts invested by an investor may be a

relevant yardstick to establish the correct fair market value of the investment at the
time of expropriation. If

 

- the investment consisted in the arms’ length acquisition from non-related
third parties of existing enterprises.

 

- the time period between investment and expropriation is not unreasonably
long,

- no major micro- or macroeconomic disruptions have occurred between
investment and expropriation, and

- the fundamental parameters of the enterprise have not been subverted (e.g. in
an investment in the natural resources sector, no significant new findings have
been made),

the actual amount invested may bear a relationship with the fair market value at the
time of expropriation and, with the appropriate adaptations for the passage of time

1 See para. 712 supra.
62 See para. 713 supra.
3 See para. 735 supra.

167

and the change in market conditions, may yield a relevant yardstick for the
valuation.

773. Inthe present case the requirement of a short time frame is probably met: Rusoro’s
first (Agapov) and second (Cradock) acquisitions were carried out in 2006, while
the third (Mena) and fourth (Gold Fields) took place in 2007. The last transaction
(Hecla) occurred in 2007, and it led to the joint venture with the State, executed in
July 2008. Only three years thereafter, the Bolivarian Republic expropriated all of
Rusoro’s Mining Rights. The average life span of each investment, between
execution and expropriation, is little more than four years.

 

 

774. However, the other requirements are not complied with. Two important changes
occurred while Rusoro held its investment:

- Rusoro significantly increased the available gold mineralization; between the
acquisition of Choco 10 on November 2007 and the Valuation Date, Rusoro
increased the reserves from 1.83 million oz. to 4.46 million 0z.° and the
total resources from 7.69 million 0z.® to 11.13 million 0z.%’; and the price
of gold escalated from USD 784/oz.°* to USD 1,812/0z.%;

 

- the Index representing the value of gold mining companies rose from
approximately 327°!” at the time when Rusoro made its acquisitions to 474°!
when it suffered expropriation.

775. Rusoro invested at times when the price of gold and gold producing companies was
(relatively) low. Venezuela chose to unlawfully expropriate Rusoro’s investment at
a time when gold and the value of gold producers had reached their peaks. Having
made the investment, Rusoro ran the risk of movements in the gold prices. In this
case, prices moved upwards. Benefit must follow risk: it would be deeply
inequitable to permit the State to expropriate Rusoro’s investment for the amount
invested, and to reap the benefits of Rusoro’s decision to invest in the Venezuelan
gold sector at the appropriate time. Otherwise States would be encouraged to
expropriate investors in the natural resources sectors when commodity prices climb,
while investors would have to bear the losses if prices plummet.

 

 

776. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Investment Valuation does not
represent the “genuine value” of Rusoro’s expropriated investment.

b. The Final Market Valuation.

The Final Market Valuation is based on the value given by the stock market to
Rusoro’s enterprise on the day before President Chavez announced the
expropriation.

The Tribunal has already found®!? that the legally relevant fair market value of an
investment equates with the price which an innocent, uninformed third party would
pay, ignorant of the State’s pre-expropriation policy towards the expropriated
company and its sector.

The Final Market Valuation is deeply contaminated by the Bolivarian Republic’s
policy decisions affecting the gold sector, adopted after Rusoro had made its
investments, and by the increased export restrictions imposed by way of the 2010
Measures.

These reasons advocate that the Final Market Valuation be excluded from the
determination of the “genuine value” of Rusoro’s investment.

ec. The Navigant Valuation.

Both parties advocate that a DCF would be an appropriate methodology to value
Rusoro’s Venezuelan enterprise®!?. The unsurmountable obstacle is that there is
only one valuation in the file which includes the DCF method, the Navigant
Valuation, and this valuation is only in a small portion a DCF valuation:

- 70% of Navigant’s calculation is based on CT and CPCT methods,
- And the remaining 30% is based on a mixed method, in which only the three

production projects in Rusoro’s portfolio are valued using a DCF model,
while the remaining projects are valued on a CT/cost basis.

 

In fact, as Dr. Burrows has shown, only 19% of Navigant’s value is directly
attributable to a DCF analysis — while 50% is based on a CPCT method and 31%
ona CT approach®!4,

Although the Tribunal understands the methodology and logic of the CP and CPCIT
“market multiples” technique, it considers that in the present case this comparative
approach is not appropriate. The situation of Venezuela in general, of the
Venezuelan gold sector in particular, and the very special characteristics
surrounding Rusoro (a Russian managed company operating in a Bolivarian
political environment) make a valuation based on comparable companies or
transactions, located or performed in other countries and political environments,
inappropriate.

Rusoro requires a “stand alone” valuation

. Only a “stand alone” valuation (confirmed by the appropriate sanity checks) is

capable of reflecting the “genuine value” of Rusoro®!>

. Although both Parties and their experts seem to support the proposal that this “stand

alone” valuation should be performed using DCF methodology, the Navigant
Valuation in fact cannot be labelled as a real DCF valuation, because it relies on
other techniques for most of its results.

The inexistence of a proper DCF valuation is — in the Tribunal’s opinion — not an
oversight, but rather the result of the very special characteristics surrounding
Rusoro, which make the use of DCF approach inappropriate, and which have led
Mr. Kaczmarek to predominantly rely on comparables methodologies:

 

 

- Rusoro lacks a proven record of financial performance: approximately 75%
of the cash flows to be valued derive not from existing facilities, but rather
from the yet to be built expansion of the existing Choco 10/Increfble mines®!®,

- The price of gold is highly volatile, and Venezuela decided to expropriate
Rusoro when gold was at one of its two historic peaks; it is difficult to recreate
the market expectations on the date of expropriation regarding the future
development of gold prices;

 

- The business plan for Choco 10/Increfble mines required additional funding
in an amount of USD 310 million®'’; there is no certainty that Rusoro would
have been able to secure the financing for this new investment;

- The country risk advocated by Navigant (1.5%) is clearly too low, and does
not reflect the actual situation of Venezuela; the tribunal in OJ European
accepted that the equivalent margin should be 6%°'*; simply adding a 4.5%
differential to the WACC used by Navigant reduces the valuation from USD
1,266 million®!? to USD 910 million®°; and accepting CRA’s proposed
WACC of 26.38%, the resulting valuation would be just USD 457 million®!;

- The Venezuelan gold sector has suffered increasing regulatory pressure, and
this makes it impossible to predict, with any certainty, how future flows
will be affected; an alternative solution, to design a “but for” scenario
excluding all regulatory impact, would not be appropriate, because the gold
sector was already regulated when Rusoro decided to enter the market.

    

5 The tribunal in OF European (at 601) came to the same conclusion in the (much less idiosyncratic)
valuation of a glass manufacturer in Venezuela.

- Rusoro’s Mining Rights have a finite duration, and the DCF model assumes
renewal; given the political uncertainty surrounding Venezuela, there are
significant doubts whether a government supporting Bolivarian ideology
would agree to a renewal; non-renewal, although non-fatal, would reduce the
DCF value of the three projects (from USD 1,266 million to USD 1,196
million®22).

Summing up, the Navigant Valuation consists of three legs, two of them
representing more than 80% of the total value, based on CT and CPCT “market
multiples” technique, and the third one based on DCF; the Tribunal finds that this
Valuation is not an appropriate basis for calculating the “genuine value” of
Rusoro’s assets:

 

- First, because the CT and CPCT “market multiple” technique, which
Navigant predominantly uses, does not provide a “stand alone” valuation of
Rusoro, responsive to the unique characteristics of this Russian managed gold
mining company operating in the gold sector of the Bolivarian Republic, and

 

- Second, as regards the DCF minority part of Navigant’s valuation, the
Tribunal has doubts whether in the specific case of Rusoro a DCF valuation
really is an appropriate technique to establish its fair market value.

 

C. The “genuine value” of the expropriated investment

The Tribunal is left with three different Valuations:

- the Maximum Market Valuation in an amount of USD 700.6 million®4;
- the Book Valuation of USD 908 million®*> and

- the Adjusted Investment Valuation of USD 1,128.7 million®®.

How to use these Valuations in order to establish the “genuine value” of the
expropriate enterprise?

The Tribunal finds that the best approach is a weighted combination of the three
Valuations, taking into consideration that each Valuation has its own strengths and
shortcomings:

- An advantage of the Maximum Market Valuation is that there is no
subjectivity in its calculation: it is simply the sum of Rusoro’s peak market
capitalization plus (negative) net debt; the shortcoming is that this valuation
was only reached for a very short period, in mid 2008, three years before the
date of expropriation; taking into consideration the advantages and
shortcomings, the Tribunal awards it a weighting of 25%;

796.

- The Book Valuation is a number which derives directly from Rusoro’s
audited balance sheet; it represents a conservative criterion, frequently found
in the valuation of enterprises, including in the Nationalization Decree; the
shortcoming is that it does not reflect the increase in the price of gold and
gold mining companies between investment and expropriation, nor the
development of the mining properties carried out under Rusoro’s watch;
setting off pros and cons the Tribunal gives it a weighting of 25%;

- The Adjusted Investment Valuation reflects the value the investment would
have reached on the date of expropriation, simply as a direct consequence of
the increase in the price of gold and of gold producing companies, between
the dates of investment and the date of expropriation; it represents the
minimum which fairness requires an expropriating state to compensate for the
expropriation of a gold producing enterprise; in the present case, the USD
1,128.7 million figure derives from the original investment consideration,
which was partially made in shares and which, in the Tribunal’s opinion,
might justify a small adjustment downwards; for this reason, the Tribunal
reduces the weighting to 50%.

 

Applying the weightings to the three Valuations, the result is USD 966.5 million’.

as ne 16 September 2011.

 

D. Respondent’s additional defences

The Bolivarian Republic raises a number of additional defences, based
predominantly on issues of law:

First, Respondent says that any compensation for rights claimed by way of venire
contra factum proprium, confianza legitima or estoppel are limited to the extent of
injury caused by detrimental reliance.

 

. Since none of Rusoro’s successful claims is based on any such doctrines, the

defence is inapposite.

. Second, Venezuela argues that Rusoro withheld the underlying data to the Micon

and Whillans Reports and that such information is needed to assess Rusoro’s
compensation™?.

Since such Reports are only relevant for the Navigant Valuation (but not for any
other Valuation), and the Tribunal has decided to exclude the Navigant Valuation
from its calculations, Venezuela’s objection has become moot.

Third, the Bolivarian Republic that Rusoro invested in Venezuela’s mining
sector at a time when all international companies were exiting. No other company
purchased assets in Venezuela’s natural resources sector. Rusoro acquired assets

for which there was effectively no market. In such circumstances a hypothetical
buyer would only be willing to pay a minimal price for these assets”.

Rusoro may well have been, at the beginning of this century, the only foreign
company buying natural resource: sin Venezuela. But then Rusoro was not an
ordinary company. As its name implies, and the nationality of its main officers
evidences, it had a strong Russian connection, and — through that connection — a
privileged access to the leading authorities of the Bolivarian Republic®!. Relying
on these relationships, Rusoro made five acquisitions in the Venezuelan gold sector,
paying to unrelated third parties an arms’ length price for the assets it purchased.

 

 

These assets have now been unlawfully expropriated by the Bolivarian Republic,
and, in accordance with the Treaty, Rusoro is entitled to be compensated with their
“genuine value”. Such value must be established — for the very reasons that
Venezuela refers to — on a “stand alone” basis. This is precisely the determination
which the Tribunal has made.

 

Fourth, the Republic complains that Rusoro was a deficient operator of its mining
properties, lacked experience in processing hard rock, and was ill-equipped to
profitably implement the substantially larger and more complicated Choco
10/Increfble 6 expansion project.

 
 

Venezuela’s present position is difficult to reconcile with the fact that in 2008 it
was prepared to create a 50/50 joint venture with Rusoro. Gold Fields’ readiness to
sell its gold producing Venezuelan operations to Rusoro, and to receive a significant
part of the consideration in Rusoro shares, also undermines Venezuela’s current
averment.

  

Be that as it may, even if it is accepted ad arguendum that Rusoro was indeed an
inefficient gold mine operator, such situation would never justify an unlawful
expropriation and would not impact on the “genuine value” of the investment
(because the hypothetical buyer must be assumed to be a reasonable and diligent
gold mine operator).

Fifth, the Republic says that any award of damages must be reduced by at least 50%
because of Rusoro’s contributory fault: the investor disregarded Article 29 of the
Mining Law and the applicable gold sales reporting requirements and refused to
sell to the BCV in 2007 and 2008°3.

3. The Tribunal does not see any contributory fault on the side of Rusoro. It has

already concluded that Rusoro’s acquisitions fell outside the scope of Article 29 of
the Mining Law and that there is no evidence that Rusoro incurred in any other

violation of the Mining Law or regulations®>.

VIII.2. DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF TREATY

Rusoro is claiming not only the fair market value of Rusoro’s investment in
Venezuela, but also the damages caused by the 2009 and 2010 Measures, and the
closure of the Swap Market, which represent its Lost Cash Flows between 30 April
2009 and 16 September 2011.

Claimant says that the Lost Cash Flows amount to USD 90.5 million, as per the
calculation made by its expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, in his second report®®. Rusoro
additionally accepts that the Lost Cash Flows originating from sales during May
and June 2009 should be excluded from the calculation, because the Measures did
not take actual effect until July 2009. This exclusion brings the calculation down to
USD 85.4 million®’, which is the amount which Rusoro claims®8,

THE EXPERTS’ CALCULATION

Navigant and CRA have devoted considerable attention to the proper calculation of
the Lost Cash Flows — the reduction in Rusoro’s income caused by the application
of the 2009 and 2010 Measures and the closure of the Swap Market in the pre-

expropriation period.

Navigant I

 

To calculate lost profits from April 2009 to September 2011, in its first report
Navigant creates two scenarios. The “Actual Scenario” reflects the historical
revenues that Rusoro achieved, which were affected by the 2009 and 2010
Measures and the closure of the Swap Market. The “But-for Scenario” shows the
revenues that Rusoro would have achieved, absent the 2009 and 2010 Measures and
the closure of the Swap Market °°. In the But-For Scenario, Navigant assumes that
Rusoro would have been able to sell all its gold at international gold spot prices™?.
By subtracting the revenue in the Actual Scenario from the revenue in the But-For
Scenario yields the pre-tax Lost Cash Flows. As Rusoro would have paid taxes on
these cash flows, Navigant applies the 34% marginal corporate tax rate™!. In the
first Navigant report the resulting net Lost Cash Flows amount to USD 106.4
million™.

CRAT

 

 

808. CRA in its first report criticizes Navigant’s Lost Cash Flow calculation, agreeing
on the methodology, but saying that the calculation is unreliable for a number of
reasons:

- CRA says that Navigant does not take into consideration that before the 2009
and 2010 Measures Rusoro was already selling its gold at a discount to
international spot gold prices. The discount averaged 20.2% during the period
from Q 4 2007 through Q | 2009, with the discount for Q 1 2009 (the last
quarter before the 2009 Measures) being 16.7%%*. CRA says that the
appropriate discount should be 18.3%, based on the most recent price
discount received by Rusoro during Q 1 2009, inclusive of the discount of
ore™5,

- Navigant calculates Lost Cash Flows based on the timing of gold sales, not
on the timing of gold production, which is inconsistent with Rusoro’s own
publicly-disclosed statements™®.

- Navigant’s analysis does not adjust for the fact that Rusoro altered the timing
of its gold sales in response to the Measures. For example, during Q 3 2009,
Rusoro did not sell any gold produced during that quarter.

- Navigant’s estimate of Lost Cash Flows includes sales of gold made prior to
the regulations™*,

809. CRA makes the appropriate corrections to Navigant’s calculation, and comes to the
conclusion that the proper determination of the Lost Cash Flows is
USD 57.3 million™.

Navigant IT

810. Navigant reviews CRA’s objection in its second report:

- Navigant agrees that cash flows from sales prior to 30 April 2009 should be
excluded from the calculation — and accepts that it mistakenly included the
month of April 2009 in its assessment®°;

- Navigant also agrees with CRA’s proposal to create a hypothetical sales

timing of production, not on the timing of sales, which during this period were
notoriously intermittent®>!;

- Navigant disagrees with CRA’s proposal to use in the But-For Scenario a gold
price discounted from the international spot price of gold; in the absence of
the 2009 and 2010 Measures, Claimant could be expected to have sold its
gold at the highest price available to it.

  

As a consequence of this review, Navigant reduce: alculation of Lost Cash

Flows from USD 106.4 million to USD 90.5 million®.

 

CRA II

In its second report, CRA still disagrees with Navigant’s calculation of Lost Cash
Flows:

- CRA says that Navigant’s revised analysis is still incorrect in that it applies
the altered timing of gold sales to both the But-For and the Actual Scenarios,
though this altered timing should apply only to the But-For Scenario; this
error results in an underestimate by Navigant of Lost Cash Flows by
approximately USD 5.1 million on an after-tax basis;

- The regulatory regime before the 2009 Measures attracted Rusoro’s
investment, and a damage estimate should assume continuation of that same
regulatory regime and assume continuation of Rusoro’s practice under that
regime of selling gold at a discount. For this reason, CRA sees no reason to
alter its analysis that an 18.3% discount to the gold price should be inserted
in the But-For Scenario.

. In Exhibit 2 to CRA’s second report Dr. Burrows presents a revised version of his

calculation of Lost Cash Flows, with monthly breakdown, and two corrections to
Navigant’s updated analysis (correct timing in the Actual Scenario plus 18.3% gold
price discount in the But-For Scenario)**. The net impact of both corrections results
in a net Lost Cash Flow calculation of USD 58.4 million.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

The Tribunal has already found that by issuing the July 2010 BCV Resolution the
Bolivarian Republic increased the volume restrictions on the export of gold, and
that such increase was in breach of Paragraph 6 (d) of the Annex to the BIT®’. The
Tribunal has also concluded that any alleged breach committed by Venezuela and

based on the 2009 Measures is time-barred®*; and that the 2010 Ley de Reforma
Cambiaria which closed the Swap Market did not amount to a violation of the BIT.

815. The task at hand is to calculate the damage suffered by Rusoro as a consequence of
Respondent’s breach of the Treaty by issuing the July 2010 BCV Resolution and
increasing the gold export restrictions. This damage is equal to the cash flows, net
of corporate tax, which Rusoro has lost, by being forced to sell a portion of its gold
at a price which is lower than the international gold prices.

816. The precise portion is 35% of production: under the historic 1996 BCV Resolution,
which was in place when Rusoro decided to invest, obligatory domestic sales were
restricted to 15% of production®°, while the corresponding figure under the July
2010 BCV Resolution was raised to 50%, in breach of the Treaty®.

817. To establish the damage caused, the Tribunal cannot rely on the calculations made
by the experts, because both Navigant and CRA assume that the 2009 and the 2010
Measures, as well as the closure of the Swap Market amounted to a breach of the
BIT — a conclusion which the Tribunal has rejected. But from the data supplied by
Navigant it is possible to extract the pre cash flows, net of corporate tax, lost by
Rusoro as a consequence of the increase in the gold export restrictions.

 

   

818. Navigant provides the appropriate figures in its Appendix 4.A of its second report!

revenue actually generated by Rusoro (excluding the impact of Venezuela’s
exchange control);

- To multiply the Additional Revenue by 35/50, because the July 2010 BCV
Resolution increased the export prohibition from 15% (which had been
established in the 1996 BCV Resolution) to 50%;

- To do so for the months August 2010 (the month in which the July 2010 BCV
Resolution came into force?) through September 2011;

- to deduct the 34% corporate tax rate.

The Tribunal concludes that the net of tax cash flows lost by Rusoro as a
consequence of the enactment of the July 2010 BCV Resolution amount to
USD 1,277,002 and orders the Bolivarian Republic to pay to Claimant such amount
as damage for the Republic’s breach of Paragraph 6 (d) of the Annex to the BIT.

VIIL3. INTEREST

. Rusoro claims pre-and post-award interest on the amounts awarded.

CLAIMANT’S POSITION

. In Rusoro’s submission, interest should accrue at Venezuela’s borrowing rate,

because Venezuela has effectively forced Rusoro to lend to it for free by not paying
compensation promptly as required by the Treaty. If Rusoro prevails in this
arbitration it faces precisely the same default risk as any other state creditor — and
consequently it should receive the same remuneration®°. Any interest rate lower
than Venezuela’s sovereign bond rate eliminates any incentive for Venezuela to pay
compensation voluntarily. Venezuela would be incentivized to prioritize the
payment of other creditors instead of satisfying any award in Rusoro’s favour,

 

Interest is not an award in addition to reparation, it is rather a component of full
reparation which gives effect to that principle”. This full reparation would not be

achieved if the award were to deprive Claimant of compound interest. For this
reason, Claimant submits that any interest awarded should be subject to reasonable
compounding,

RESPONDENT’S POSITION

 

Respondent says that Art. VII.1 of the Treaty mandates that compensation “shall be
payable from the date of expropriation with interest at a normal commercial rate”,
which in Respondent’s opinion corresponds to short-term US Treasury bill rates.
Any higher rate would effectively grant Rusoro an increased benefit for riskier
investments, without actually having run the risk of losses. Since there is little to no
risk of not collecting a valid damages award against Venezuela, Rusoro is not
entitled to a rate that compensates it for the time value of money plus default risk,
which is what Venezuelan sovereign bonds offer its holders.

 

As regards compounding, although Venezuela readily admits that some arbitral
tribunals have recently awarded compound interest, other recent decisions that grant
simple interest are more relevant to the circumstances of this case, like RosInvest®”
where the Tribunal refused to award compound interest because claimant’s
investment was speculative.

 

 

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

The BIT foresees the accrual and payment of interest both on the compensation for
expropriation and on damages for breach:

- Art. VIL1 mandates that the compensation “shall be payable from the date of
expropriation with interest at a normal commercial rate”; and

- Art. XIL9 authorizes the Tribunal to award “monetary damages and any
applicable interest”.

The Tribunal must decide the dies a quo, the dies ad quem, the appropriate interest
rate, the principal amount and calculation methodology.

Dies a quo

Art. VIL1 provides that interest on the compensation for expropriation should start
to accrue on the date of expropriation, in the present case 16 September 2011. Since
the damages for breach of the Treaty occurred slightly before the date of
expropriation, the Tribunal finds that the same dies a quo should apply for such
damages.

Dies ad quem

Interest shall continue to accrue until the date of effective payment.

Interest rate

The Treaty does not impose any specific interest rate — it simply refers to “a normal
commercial rate”, affording the Tribunal discretion to select any rate which
complies with the double requirement of being normal and commercial.

3. Claimant’s proposal is for the Tribunal to select Venezuela’s borrowing rate, with

the argument that Venezuela has effectively forced Rusoro to become an
involuntary lender. Navigant has made the appropriate calculations, has selected
certain Venezuelan bonds maturing in 2014-2016, and has come up with an average
interest rate of almost 13%°7!.

 

Respondent’s proposal is that the appropriate rate should be short-term U.S.
Treasury bills, which practically offer no return”.

The Tribunal disagrees with both proposals. Neither represents a “normal
commercial rate”. The rate proposed by Claimant is the yield of Venezuela’s
sovereign bonds on the date of expropriation, and the rate proposed by Venezuela
that of short-term debt of the US Treasury. Neither party has shown that any of
these rates is used in a “normal” “commercial” environment.

In the Tribunal’s opinion, the best approach for establishing “a normal commercial
rate” is to select LIBOR plus an appropriate margin.

LIBOR is an international commercial benchmark: the interest rate at which banks
can borrow funds from other banks in the London interbank market. LIBOR is
published daily for different maturities and currencies and is universally accepted
as a valid reference for the calculation of variable interest rates°™. Since the
compensation is expressed in USD, the appropriate rate of reference for the
calculation of interest should be the LIBOR rates for one year deposits denominated
in USD, calculated as of the date of expropriation. The rate shall be adjusted every
year thereafter, to reflect changing conditions.

LIBOR reflects the interest rate at which banks lend to each other money. Loans to
customers invariably include a surcharge, and this surcharge must be inserted in the
calculation of interest to reflect the financial loss caused to Claimant by the
temporary withholding of money. In the present market situation of ultra-low
interest rates, the Tribunal finds that a margin of 4% is appropriate, and that
(whatever the LIBOR rate for one year deposits) a minimum of 4% p.a. interest
should in any case be payable.

Principal amount

Interest shall accrue on the amounts awarded in favour of Rusoro in this Award:
USD 966,500,000 as compensation for the expropriation plus USD 1,277,002 as
damages for Venezuela’s breach of the Treaty.

Simple or compounded

Claimant has requested that interest should be compounded, while Respondent
proposes that simple interest be applied. The question to be decided by the Tribunal
is whether unpaid LIBOR interest, calculated as simple interest and accruing at the
end of each six month period, should be added to the principal, and as such accrue
interest in the succeeding interest periods.

The question whether interest should be accumulated periodically to the principal
has been the subject of diverging decisions. While older case law tended to
repudiate this possibility, recent case law tends to accept annual or semi-annual
capitalisation of unpaid interest”,

The Tribunal sides with the more modern decisions. Loan agreements in which
interest is calculated on the basis of LIBOR plus a margin usually include a
provision that unpaid interest must be capitalised at the end of the interest period,
and will thereafter be considered as capital and accrue interest. The financial reason
for this provision is that an unpaid lender has to resort to the LIBOR market, in
order to fund the amounts due but defaulted, and the lender’s additional funding
costs have to be covered by the defaulting borrower.

. This principle implies in our case that, if Claimant were to take out a LIBOR loan

to anticipate the amounts to which it is entitled under the Award, the bank would
insist that unpaid interest be capitalised at the end of each interest period.
Consequently, if Claimant is to be kept fully indemnified for the harm suffered,
interest owed under the Award should be capitalised at the end of each annual
interest period. The Tribunal, thus, decides that due and unpaid interest shall be
capitalized annually, from the dies a quo.

VIIL4. TAXES
Rusoro submits that it is entitled to a tax indemnification. Venezuela rejects

Rusoro’s contention and submits that the Tribunal should deny this request.

The Tribunal will now advance the Parties’ position with respect to Rusoro’s claim
for tax indemnification (1.) and adopt a decision (2.).

THE PARTIES’ POSITION
In its Post Hearing Brief Rusoro requests the Tribunal to declare™”*:

- that any award of compensation granted to Rusoro is net of all applicable
‘Venezuelan taxes;

- order Venezuela to indemnify Rusoro for any Venezuelan taxes imposed on
the compensation awarded.

. These rules support Rusoro’s position. The Bolivarian Republic i

(Initially Rusoro also requested the Tribunal to (i) declare that Venezuela may not
tax or attempt to tax the Award; (ii) and to order Venezuela to indemnify Claimant
for any double taxation liability that might arise in Canada or elsewhere®”’. These
claims, however, were abandoned in Rusoro’s Post Hearing Brief).

Rusoro argues that Navigant’s report on damages (both the estimate of Rusoro’s
lost profits and the assessment of Rusoro’s enterprise value) has been prepared net
of Venezuelan taxes’. Therefore, if Venezuela imposes any taxation on the
eventual award, Claimant will have been taxed twice for the same income. Only an
award ensuring Claimant’s indemnity for any taxation would place Rusoro in the
financial position but for Venezuela’s breach of the Treaty®”.

Venezuela says that Rusoro’s request that the Tribunal declare that the award be net
of Venezuelan taxes has become moot, since the valuation prepared by Claimant’s
expert is already net of Venezuelan taxes®°; and that Rusoro’s request for
indemnification for any taxes that Venezuela may impose on the Award is
speculative and premature, because Rusoro has failed to identify which Venezuelan
taxes, if any, would be applicable.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECI.

 

Rusoro makes two distinct requests:
- that the Tribunal declare that the amounts awarded to Rusoro be net of taxes;

- to order Venezuela to indemnify Claimant with respect to any Venezuelan
taxes imposed on the compensation awarded.

The Tribunal sides with Rusoro.

The BIT specifies that the compensation for expropriation must be “prompt,
adequate and effective”®*! and “shall be paid without delay and shall be effectively
realizable and freely transferable”.

 

sovereign State
that can tax any assets or payments located in or originating from its territory. If the
Bolivarian Republic were to impose a tax on Rusoro’s award, Venezuela could
reduce the compensation “effectively” received by Rusoro. A reductio ad absurdum
proves the point: Venezuela could practically avoid the obligation to pay Rusoro
the compensation awarded by fixing a 99% tax rate on income derived from
compensations issued by international tribunals, thereby ensuring that Rusoro
would only effectively receive a compensation of 1% of the amount granted.

In its Memorial and Reply, Rusoro sought indemnity in respect of any double
taxation of the Award that may rise in Canada (or elsewhere), to the extent this
liability would not have arisen had Venezuela observed its international
commitments under the Treaty. This claim seems to have been abandoned in
Rusoro’s Post Hearing Brief. In any case, the claim lacks merit. Any tax liability
arising under Canadian tax laws (or from any other fiscal regime, other than the
Venezuelan), does not qualify as consequential loss arising from Venezuela’s
breach of the Treaty and does not engage Venezuela’s liability.

In conclusion, the Tribunal declares that the compensation, damages and interest
granted in this Award are net of any taxes imposed by the Bolivarian Republic and
orders the Bolivarian Republic to indemnify Rusoro with respect to any Venezuelan
taxes imposed on such amounts.

Article 52(1)(j) of the AF Rules provides that

“[t]he award shall be made in writing and shall contain [...] any decision of
the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding”.

On the last day of the Hearing the Tribunal requested the Parties to submit a
statement of costs®*', The Parties did so on 1 July 2015. None of the Parties
challenged the items or the amounts claimed by the counterparty.

CLAIMANT’S POSITION

Claimant sustains that when allocating costs, the starting point for the Tribunal
should be the principle of “costs follow the event”. This criterion is consistent with
the principle of full reparation, insofar as it is necessary to wipe out the
consequences of Venezuela’s wrongful conduct®*>. Accordingly, Claimant requests
the Tribunal to order Venezuela to pay all of the costs and expenses of this
arbitration®*°,

Additionally, the Tribunal should take into account Venezuela’s conduct
throughout the arbitration, which has unnecessarily delayed the proceeding, such
as, its refusal to pay its share of costs, the unmeritorious challenge of a co-arbitrator,
extensive document production requests and submission of evidence in advanced
stages of the proceeding®*’.

Specifically, Claimant requests the reimbursement of the following costs and

expenses*;

- Fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID

o Lodging fee for the Request for Arbitration: USD 25,000;

o Advances on costs®°: USD 1,145,000;
- Travel costs and expenses of witnesses and representatives: USD 75,910.66;
- Legal fees: USD 6,957,528.42;

- Expert fees: USD 1,713,386.01°.

Venezuela submits that the Tribunal should award costs against the party which
generated unnecessary expenses to its counterparty. In the present case Rusoro
initiated a time-barred claim before a wrong forum and opposed the bifurcation of
the jurisdictional issues. The result was that Venezuela incurred in unnecessary
costs related to the merits and damages of the case®!. Therefore the Tribunal should
order Rusoro to bear Venezuela’s costs ated to this proceeding since the date
of Rusoro’s opposition to Venezuela’s request for bifurcation (15 May 2013), plus
interest.

 

 

 

   

  
 

Specifically, Venezuela requests the reimbursement of the following costs and
expenses:

 

 

- Legal fees: USD 9,142,809.63;
- Expert fees: USD 5,920,749.63;
- Administrative expenses: USD 1,255,787.78;

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECI

 

. Article XII(9) of the BIT sets forth that the Tribunal “may also award costs in

accordance with the applicable arbitration rules”. And Article 58(1) of the AF Rules
establishes that:

“Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by
whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and
charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceeding shall be borne”.

 

Neither the Arbitration AF Rules nor the BIT contain any guidelines for the
apportionment of costs. Therefore, the Tribunal has ample discretion to decide on
how the costs of this proceeding will be apportioned.

The Tribunal looks favourably upon the criterion, often used in investment
arbitration, that the losing party should make a significant contribution to the
payment of the arbitration fees and the costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing
party.

In the present case both Parties request that the Tribunal order their counter-party
to bear the full amount (or a great portion, in the ci of Venezuela) of the costs
arising from this arbitration. Venezuela bases its petition on the argument that this
Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Rusoro’s claims and that Rusoro’s substantiation
of the proceeding generated unnecessary expenses to the Republic.

 

The Tribunal concluded that only the portion of Rusoro’s claim based on the 2009
Measures was time-barred; but the Tribunal asserted its jurisdiction over Rusoro’s

claims based on the 2010 Measures and the Nationalization Decree. Furthermore,
the Tribunal concluded that Venezuela unlawfully expropriated Rusoro’s Mining
Rights and breached Paragraph 6 (d) of the Annex to the BIT by issuing the 2010
BCV Resolution. Finally, the Tribunal has determined that Venezuela must
indemnify Claimant in the amount of USD 967,777,002, as a consequence of the
Republic’s violations of the BIT.

Taking into account that Rusoro has prevailed in a significant portion of its relief,
the Tribunal decides that Respondent shall bear part of Claimant’s costs.

In allocating arbitration costs, the Tribunal will consider two main categories of
costs:

- the lodging fee and advance on costs paid to ICSID [the “Costs of the
Proceeding”);

- the expenses incurred by the Parties to further their position in the arbitration
[the “Defense Expenses”].

A. Costs of the Proceeding

The Tribunal finds that Claimant has prevailed, not entirely, but to a great extent,
in this proceeding: the Tribunal confirmed its jurisdiction over claims based on the
2010 Measures onwards and held that Venezuela unlawfully expropriated Rusoro’s
investment and restricted the export of gold. Finally it awarded approximately 1/3
of Rusoro’s requested damages.

For this reason, the Tribunal finds that Respondent must bear 75% of the Cost of
the Proceeding. Since Claimant has paid a disproportionate part of the Cost of the
Proceedings, Respondent shall reimburse Claimant in an amount of
USD 877,500.

B. Defense Expenses

Rusoro requests the reimbursement of a wide variety of Defense Expenses related
to attorneys’ and experts’ fees and travel costs and expenses of witnesses and
representatives. The Tribunal is of the opinion that Respondent should not bear all
the expenses incurred by Claimant without limitation. Venezuela shall only bear
the Defense Expens ctually incurred by Claimant that are indispensable to
adequately defend its position [the “Reasonable Defense Expenses”]. Taking into
account the complexity of this case, the amount in dispute and the work performed
by the attorneys and experts, the Tribunal determines that the amount of Reasonable
Expenses is USD 3,000,000 for attorneys and USD 1,000,000 for experts.

876.

This arbitration was divided in three main stages: jurisdiction, liability and
damages. In order to determine the apportionment of costs, the Tribunal will assume
that Claimant’s Reasonable Defense Expenses have been divided as follows:

- One third of the attorneys’ fees and expenses to each stage of the arbitration;

- USD 250.000 of the fees for Prof. Muci’s legal expert opinion to the
jurisdiction stage;

- USD 750,000 of the remaining experts’ fees and expenses to the damages
stage.

Therefore, the apportionment of Reasonable Defense Expenses to each phase of the
proceeding is:

- Jurisdiction: USD 1,250,000;
- Liability: USD 1,000,000;

- Damages: USD 1,750,000.
Accordingly:

- In the jurisdiction stage, the Tribunal only partially accepted one (of a total
of three) of Venezuela’s jurisdictional objections. The Tribunal decides that
Venezuela shall pay 60% of Claimant’s Reasonable Defense Expenses
incurred in the jurisdiction stage: USD 750,000.%”.

- In the liability stage, the Tribunal rejected Rusoro’s claim that Venezuela
carried out a creeping expropriation and that the Republic breached the FET,
FPS, discrimination and free transfer of funds provisions of the BIT. However
the Tribunal did find that Respondent unlawfully expropriated Rusoro’s
investment in Venezuela, and that it breach Paragraph 6 (d) of the Annex to
the BIT. Therefore the Tribunal decides that Venezuela shall pay 80% of
Claimant’s Reasonable Defense Expenses incurred in the liability stage: USD
800,000°°8.

- In the damages phase, Rusoro claimed USD 2.4 billion in damages. The
Tribunal concluded that the damages owed to Claimant as a consequence of
Venezuela’s breach of the BIT is USD 967,777,002. The Tribunal holds
that Venezuela must pay 50% of Claimant’s Reasonable Defense Expenses
incurred in the damages stage: USD 875,000”.

X. SUMMARY

879. In its Post Hearing Brief, Claimant requested the Tribunal to”?:
“219. [...]
(a) DISMISS all Venezuela’s objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal;

(b) DECLARE that Venezuela violated Article VII(1) of the Treaty by
expropriating the Claimant’s investment without payment of compensation;

(c) DECLARE that Venezuela violated Article II(2) of the Treaty by failing
to accord the Claimant’s investments fair and equitable treatment;

(d) DECLARE that Venezuela violated Article II(2) of the Treaty by failing
to accord the Claimant’s investments full protection and security; and

(e) DECLARE that Venezuela violated Article IV of the Treaty by failing to
accord the Claimant treatment no less favorable than the treatment it grants to
its own investors;

(f) DECLARE that Venezuela violated Article VIII of the Treaty by failing to
guarantee to the Claimant the unrestricted transfer of its investments and
returns; and

(g) DECLARE that Venezuela violated paragraph 6 of the Annex to the Treaty
by imposing restrictions on the exportation of gold.

(h) DISMISS Venezuela’s Counter-claim;

(i) ORDER Venezuela to pay compensation to the Claimant of no less than
US $2,318,898,825 and, to the extent applicable, DECLARE that the sum
awarded has been calculated net of Venezuelan taxes;

(j) ORDER Venezuela to pay pre- and post-award interest at Venezuela’s
sovereign borrowing rate (as updated), compounded annually, accruing until
payment is made in full or such other rate as the Tribunal deems appropriate;

(k) ORDER Venezuela to indemnify the Claimant in full with respect to any
Venezuelan taxes imposed on the compensation awarded to the extent that
such compensation has been calculated net of Venezuelan taxes;

(1) ORDER Venezuela to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration,
including the Claimant’s reasonable legal and expert fees, and the fees and
expenses of the Tribunal; and

(m) AWARD such other relief to the Claimant as the Tribunal considers
appropriate.

220. To the extent this Tribunal finds that Venezuela’s Measures constituted
a creeping expropriation in violation of Article VII of the Treaty (paragraph
219(b) above) and that the compensation to be awarded to Rusoro includes the
72 C PHB at 219.
190

effects of each of those measures calculated by reference to Fair Market
Value, Rusoro would be content for the Tribunal to make those findings
without proceeding to consider the additional violations of the Treaty
(paragraph 219 (c)-(g) above)”.

880. And Venezuela requested the Tribunal to”:
“Tssue an Award stating it lacks jurisdiction to hear Rusoro’s claims under the
Treaty and the Additional Facility, and order Rusoro to pay all the fees,
expenses, and costs associated with defending against these proceedings since
the date of its opposition to Venezuela’s request for bifurcation (15 May
2013), with interest;

Should the Tribunal find that it has jurisdiction to hear Rusoro’s dispute,

- only consider claims for compensation for alleged breaches and harm after
17 July 2009,

- issue an Award dismissing all of Rusoro’s claims in their entirety for lack of
factual and legal merit, and

- find that Venezuela is entitled to compensation for injury suffered based on
the counter-claim specified in Part IV;

Should the Tribunal find Venezuela has breached any provision of the Treaty
or is otherwise legally responsible,

- issue an Award indicating that Rusoro has failed to meet its burden to prove
the quantum of its damages and finding that Venezuela is not required to pay
Rusoro any compensation;

Should the Tribunal award damages,

- find that damages are limited to compensation for alleged reserves based on
DCF values included in the final column of Table 6 of the Experts’ Joint
Matrix;

- reduce damages by at least 50% for contributory fault; and

- for any liability based on venire contra factum proprium, confianza legitima,
or estoppel, limit damages to injury caused by detrimental reliance; and

Grant Venezuela any other remedy that the Tribunal considers appropriate”.

881.

The Tribunal will now make a brief summary of the decisions taken with respect to
the Parties request for relief.

1. JURISDICTION

882. Venezuela submitted three jurisdictional objections:

73 R PHB at 268.
191

First Jurisdictional Objection: the time bar

883. Venezuela argues that Rusoro’s claims are time barred by the statute of limitations

in Art. XII.3 (d) of the BIT, which requires the investor to submit a dispute to
arbitration within three years from the date when the investor obtained actual
knowledge of the breach and of the damage caused by such breach.

884. Respondent submits that the entire dispute is time-barred, Rusoro’s main claim for

expropriation being based on several measures which Venezuela adopted before the
Cut-Off Date, i.e. 17 July 2009.

885. The Tribunal concluded that the 2009 Measures occurred before the Cut-Off date

and that Claimant was aware of their existence and of their potentially detrimental
effect on the investment. Therefore, the Tribunal held that any claim based on any
of the 2009 Measures was time-barred”. The Tribunal, however, rejected
ubmission that the entire dispute be time-barred. The Tribunal
jurisdiction over Rusoro’s claims supported by other breaches which
occurred after the Cut-Off date”.

  

Second Ju ional Objection: AF Rules

886. Venezuela’s second jurisdictional objection is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction

under the AF Rules, because neither Canada nor Venezuela were parties to the
ICSID Convention by the time the Secretary-General of ICSID registered Rusoro’s
Request for Arbitration.

887. The Tribunal concluded that the relevant date for the requirement that at least one

State be a party to the ICSID Convention is not the date of registration by the
Secretary General — erred by Venezuela — but the date when the investor files
a request for approval to institute a proceeding under the AF Rules’. It is
undisputed that Rusoro submitted its Request for Arbitration, including its
application for approval to access ICSID AF, before Venezuela’s denunciation of
the ICSID Convention came into effect — and therefore, Venezuela was a party to
the ICSID Convention at that time. Consequently, the Tribunal dismissed
Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection.

 

 

888. Finally, Venezuela argues that Rusoro breached Venezuelan law, and _ that

704
0s
706
707

consequently Rusoro’s investment forfeited any protection under the BIT for two
reasons:

- first, Rusoro breached Art. 29 of the Mining Law by failing to obtain the
necessary authorization from the Ministry of Mines to acquire its Mining
Rights in Venezuela, and

See paras. 195 and 197 supra.
See para, 232 et seq supra.

See paras. 231 - 232 and 236 supra.
See para, 266 supra.

192

889.

891.

892.

- second, Rusoro breached the mining regulation by failing to report and
account for its purported domestic sales or the final destination of the gold
produced, thus feeding an illegal export market.

Regarding the first argument, the Tribunal concluded that Rusoro complied at all
times with the Mining Law. Rusoro acquired its Mining Rights through the
acquisition or control of non-Venezuelan corporations which in turn controlled
Venezuelan companies, which held Mining Rights in Venezuela. The Tribunal
concluded that Rusoro was not required to apply for authorization under Art. 29 of
the Mining Law, which is only applicable to the transfer of concessions”. With
regards to the argument based on the creation of an illegal export market, the
Tribunal dismissed Venezuela’s submission for lack of supportive evidence™.

LIABILITY

. Venezuela raises an additional objection arguing that Claimant’s claims are

 

inadmissible because Rusoro did not pursue its investment in good faith. The
Tribunal rejected Venezuela’s contention, because Rusoro’s acquisitions were in
conformity with Venezuelan law and Rusoro never misrepresented its identity as a
Russian owned company7!°,

Expropriation

Rusoro’s central claim in this arbitration is that Venezuela expropriated Rusoro’s
investment in violation of Article VII of the Treaty. Claimant alleges that it suffered
a direct expropriation through the Nationalization Decree; and additionally, that it
suffered a creeping expropriation through a series of interconnected measures
consisting of the 2009 and 2010 Measures, the closure of the Swap Market and
finalized with the Nationalization Decree of September 2011.

The Tribunal concluded that Venezuela unlawfully expropriated Rusoro’s Mining
Rights by failing to pay the prompt, adequate and effective compensation required
in Art. VIL.1 of the BIT7!!. Regarding the allegation for creeping expropriation, the
Tribunal found that:

- the 2009 Measures have to be excluded from the analysis as a consequence
of the statute of limitations of Art. XII.3 (d)’!?;

- Rusoro failed to produce convincing evidence that the 2010 Measures or the
2010 Ley de Reforma Cambiaria which closed the Swap Market were part of
a premeditated plan of the Venezuelan authorities to nationalize the gold
sector.

708 See paras, 324 - 339 supra.
1 See paras. 342 et seq supra.
210 See para. 356 supra.
711 See para. 409 supra.
712 See para. 428 supra.

In fact, the 2010 Measures re-liberalized the gold regime and diminished the
adverse impact of the 2009 Measures. In light of these findings, the Tribunal
rejected Rusoro’s claim for creeping expropriation’!>.
Ancillary Claims
893. Rusoro also submits that, by adopting the 2009 and 2010 Measures, Venezuela
- breached the FET and FPS standards;
- treated Rusoro and its investment in a discriminatory manner;
- impeded Rusoro from freely transferring its funds; and
- imposed an export ban on gold in breach of the BIT.
894. The Tribunal rejected two preliminary defences submitted by Venezuela:
- that Rusoro was favouring the illegal export of gold; and
- that the Measures where adopted to guarantee the “integrity and stability” of
its “financial system”, and were excluded from the scope of protection
afforded by the BIT pursuant to Art. X of the Treaty.
895. Regarding Rusoro’s claims, the Tribunal held that any Ancillary Claim based on

the 2009 Measures was time-barred. As for the 2010 Measures and the Ley de
Reforma Cambiaria, the Tribunal concluded that:

  

- The Ley de Reforma Cambiaria which closed the Swap Market and the
Amendment of the Convenio Cambiario No. 12, were legitimate sovereign
measures, adopted according to the established procedure, within the
framework of the general exchange control regime already in force when
Rusoro entered the Venezuelan gold market.

- Therefore, the Tribunal rejected Rusoro’s claims for breach of the FET’! and
the FPS standards”!>. Furthermore, the Tribunal dismissed Rusoro’s claim for
breach of Art. VIII of the BIT, which guarantees investors free transfer of
funds. The closure of the Swap Market was exclusively aimed at prohibiting
a parallel foreign currency market; the market operators still had access to a
centralized exchange control system managed by the BCV and based on the

fficial Exchange Rate”!®,

 

- The 2010 Measures regulating the sale and export of gold (the July 2010 BCV
Resolution and the Amendment of the Convenio Cambiario No. 12) did not

See para, 533 supra.

See paras. 554 supra.

194

amount to a breach of the FET’!” or FPS standards7!®; neither did these
measures amount to a breach of the free transfer of funds guaranteed in the
BIT’.

- Rusoro suffered no discrimination because the 2010 Measures unified the
gold mining regime for public and privately owned miners (thereby correcting
the 2009 Measures); Venezuela also did not discriminate against Rusoro by
affording special treatment to small scale producers of gold in the 2010
Measures””°.

- However the Tribunal concluded that the adoption of the July 2010 BCV
Resolution breached Paragraph 6 (d) of the Annex to the BIT, by imposing
an increased restriction in terms of volume on the exportation of gold””!.

Venezuela’s counter-claim

896. Venezuela filed a counter-claim averring that Rusoro applied an improper mining
strategy in the Choco 10 mine, which had a detrimental impact on its future
viability.

897. The Tribunal concluded that it had no jurisdiction to adjudicate Venezuela’s

counter-claim’*.

3. QUANTUM

898. Rusoro claims an amount of USD 2.4 billion as compensation for Venezuela’s
expropriation of Rusoro’s investment; plus USD 90 million for the Lost Cash Flows
suffered as a consequence of the 2009 and 2010 Measures; and interest on these
quantities.

899. The Tribunal concluded that

- the proper compensation due to Rusoro for the unlawful expropriation of its
investment in Venezuela amounts to USD 966,500,000 and that

- the proper calculation of damages due to Rusoro for Venezuela’s breach of
Paragraph 6 (d) of the Annex to the BIT amounts to USD 1,277,002.

900. Additionally the Tribunal decided to grant Rusoro interest on the amounts of
compensation and damages (i.e. USD 967,777,002"), accrued between 16
September 2011 and the date of actual payment, calculated at the interest rate p.a.

equal to USD LIBOR for one year deposits, plus a margin of 4%, with a minimum
of 4% p.a, to be compounded annually”*.

The Tribunal dismissed Venezuela’s defences that damages should be reduced for
contributory fault or that in certain instances damages should be limited to injury
caused by detrimental reliance”.

Furthermore the Tribunal granted Rusoro’s requests to declare the Award net of
Venezuelan taxes and to order Venezuela to indemnify Claimant with respect to
any Venezuelan tax imposed on the compensation awarded’”°.

 

3. The Tribunal ordered the Bolivarian Republic to pay to Rusoro USD 3,302,500 as

costs incurred in the present arbitration’?’.
