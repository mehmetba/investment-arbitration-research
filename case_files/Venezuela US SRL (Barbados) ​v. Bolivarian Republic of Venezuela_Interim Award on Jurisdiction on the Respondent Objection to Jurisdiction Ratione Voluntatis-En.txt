Interim Award on Jurisdiction
Page 4 of 45

(1) Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other
Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to
an investment of the latter shall, at the request of the national concerned, be submitted to the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or

iliation under the C on the I of S Disputes between States

and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on March 18, 1965.

(2) As long as the Republic of Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the
Convention as mentioned in paragraph | of this Article, disputes as referred to in that paragraph
shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment disputes under the
Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the
Secretariat of the Centre (Additional Facility Rules). If for any reason the Additional Facility
is not available the investor shall have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under the

rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

(3) The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the
Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach of

of compensation.

(4) Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission
of disputes as referred to in paragraph | of this Article to international arbitration in accordance

with the provisions of this Article.

The Claimant, a company organized under the laws of Barbados, alleges that the Respondent,
through its acts and omissions, as well as those of State-owned entities acting under its direction
and control, breached its obligations under Articles 2, 3 and 5 of the Treaty with respect to the

Claimant’s investment in the oil and gas industry in Venezuela.

CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

In its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant appointed The Hon. L. Yves Fortier PC CC OQ QC as

the first arbitrator.

By letter dated 13 June 2013, the Claimant requested that the Secretary-General of the Permanent
Court of Arbitration (the “PCA”) designate an appointing authority pursuant to Articles 6(1) and
6(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules (2010).

On 16 July 2013, the Secretary-General of the PCA designated Professor Piero Bernardini as

appointing authority.

By letter dated 17 July 2013, the Claimant requested that Professor Bernardini appoint an

arbitrator on behalf of the Respondent.

By e-mail of 1 August 2013, the Respondent advised that it had appointed the law firm of Curtis,
Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP to represent it in this case and that the Parties had agreed to a

Parties for their comments.

By letter dated 13 December 2013, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Draft Terms
of Appointment and asserted that the UNCITRAL Rules (1976) were applicable to the
proceedings. By letter of the same date, the Claimant submitted its comments on the Draft Terms
of Appointment and acknowledged that the original UNCITRAL Rules (1976) were applicable
and would govern the arbitration in lieu of the revised UNCITRAL Rules (2010) under which it

had commenced the arbitration.

By letter dated 18 December 2013, the Tribunal issued a final version of the Terms of
Appointment, which were subsequently executed by the Parties and the Tribunal (the last
signature being on 9 January 2014), and circulated a Draft Procedural Order No. | for the Parties’

comments.

BIFURCATION OF THE PROCEEDINGS

By letter dated 7 March 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties to make submissions on whether to
bifurcate the proceedings and whether to hold an in-person procedural meeting to discuss the

Respondent’s request for bifurcation and the timetable for the proceedings.

By e-mail of 11 March 2014, the Respondent conveyed a request on behalf of both Parties that

the Tribunal hold a procedural meeting in person.

By letter of the same date, the Respondent submitted a request for bifurcation of the proceedings
(the “Request for Bifurcation”) asking the Tribunal to rule upon its first jurisdictional objection

relating to the lack of jurisdiction ratione voluntatis as a preliminary matter.

in person on 19 March 2014 at the Peace Palace in The Hague, the Netherlands.

By letter dated 14 March 2014, the Claimant agreed to the bifurcation of the Respondent’s first
jurisdictional objection relating to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione voluntatis and proposed a

timetable for bifurcated proceedings.

By e-mail of 14 March 2014, the Respondent notified the Tribunal and the Claimant of a challenge
to Mr. Fortier under Articles 10 and 11 of the UNCITRAL Rules for lack of independence and
impartiality and requested that the procedural meeting scheduled for 19 March 2014 be

postponed.

By separate e-mail and letter dated 14 March 2014, the Claimant raised certain concerns regarding
the disclosures made by Mr. Bottini with his statement of independence and impartiality, and

opposed the Respondent’s request to postpone the procedural meeting.

The Parties exchanged further correspondence on whether to postpone the procedural meeting
including the Respondent’s further e-mail of 14 March 2014, the Claimant’s e-mail of 15 March
2014, the Respondent’s e-mail of 16 March 2014, and the Claimant’s e-mail of 16 March 2014.

By letter dated 16 March 2014, the Presiding Arbitrator acknowledged the Parties’ agreement to
bifurcate the Respondent’s first jurisdictional objection and decided, subject to subsequent
revision by the full Tribunal, to cancel the proposed procedural meeting and to establish a

procedural calendar for the preliminary jurisdictional phase of the arbitration.

JURISDICTIONAL PHASE

By letter dated 17 March 2014, following the Claimant’s indication that it did not agree to the
challenge and Mr. Fortier’s refusal to withdraw, the Respondent submitted the challenge to

Professor Bernardini for a decision pursuant to Article 12 of the UNCITRAL Rules.

On 9 May 2014, the Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Respondent’s Objection to

the Jurisdiction Ratione Voluntatis of the Tribunal (the “Counter-Memorial’”).

On 30 May 2014, the Respondent submitted its Reply Memorial on the Objection to the
Jurisdiction Ratione Voluntatis of the Tribunal (the “Reply”).

Ill. RELEVANT LEGAL PROVISIONS
A THE TREATY

45. The dispute to be decided in the present phase of the proceedings concerns whether the Tribunal
has jurisdiction to entertain the claims contained in the Statement of Claim. The Respondent
requests the Tribunal to dismiss the claims “for lack of jurisdiction ratione voluntatis”.? The
Claimant maintains that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the case on the merits and requests
the Tribunal to dismiss “[t]he Respondent’s objection to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal for lack

3

of consent.”* The resolution of this disagreement between the Parties depends on the proper
interpretation of Article 8 of the Treaty, containing the relevant dispute settlement provisions and,
depending on the conclusion the Tribunal will reach, possibly also on the application of Article 3

of the Treaty, containing a Most Favored Nation (“MEN”) clause.
46. Article 8 provides as follows:

ARTICLE 8
Settlement of Disputes Between one Contracting Party
and Nationals or Companies of the other Contracting

Party

(1) Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other
Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to
an investment of the latter shall, at the request of the national concerned, be submitted to the

International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or

 

iliation under the C on the I of S Disputes between States

and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on March 18, 1965.

(2) As long as the Republic of Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the
Convention as mentioned in paragraph | of this Article, disputes as referred to in that paragraph
shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment disputes under the
Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the
Secretariat of the Centre (Additional Facility Rules). If for any reason the Additional Facility
is not available the investor shall have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under the

rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

(3) The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the
Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach of
obligations has caused damages to the national concerned, and if such is the case, the amount

of compensation.

(4) Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission

 

of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance

with the provisions of this Article.

Article 3 reads as follows:

ARTICLE 3

National Treatment and Most-favoured-nation Provisions

(1) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investments or returns of
nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than that
which it accords to investments or returns of its own nationals or companies or to investments

or returns of nationals or companies of any third State.

(2) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject nationals or companies of
the other Contracting Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal of their investments, to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to its own

nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State.

(3) The treatment provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the

provisions of Articles | to 11 of this Agreement.

VIENNA CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF TREATIES

  

In addition to the relevant provisions of the Treaty, it is

 

structive to reproduce here the rules on the
interpretation of treaties set forth in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of

Treaties (the “WCLT”), which both Parties acknowledge govern the interpretation of the Treaty:

Article 31

General rule of interpretation

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning

to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition

to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

PCA Case No. 2013-34
Interim Award on Jurisdiction
Page 12 of 45

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in

connection with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the

conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.
3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty

or the application of its provisions;

 

(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement

of the parties regarding its interpretation;
(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so

intended.

Article 32

Supplementary means of interpretation

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the
preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the
meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the

interpretation according to article 31:
(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

49. The Tribunal notes that, while Barbados is a Party to the VCLT, having ratified it on
24 June 1971, Venezuela is not a Party to it and has not even signed it. But it is now well accepted
that Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT on interpretation of treaties codify customary rules of
international law. In other words, these Articles reflect customary international law, as confirmed

on various occasions by the International Court of Justice.*

REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
RESPONDENT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF
The Respondent requests the Tribunal to grant the following relief:

Respondent respectfully submits that all claims contained in the Statement of Claim should be
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction ratione voluntatis and that this Tribunal should allocate the

's of these proceedings to Claimant.>

 

CLAIMANT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF
The Claimant requests that the Tribunal grant the following relief:

For the reasons stated above and in Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction,
Respondent’s objection to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal for lack of consent should be

dismissed, and this arbitration should proceed on the merits.°

ISSUES ON JURISDICTION
INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE TREATY
1. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent objects to the jurisdiction ratione voluntatis of the Tribunal on the basis that
Article 8 of the Treaty does not provide a valid and effective consent to arbitration under the
UNCITRAL Rules in the circumstances of the present case. While the Respondent has given its
“unconditional consent” to arbitration in Article 8(4) of the Treaty, it has only done so “in
accordance with the provisions of this Article”, which limited its consent to UNCITRAL

arbitration to a specific brief period that has long passed.”

According to the Respondent, “the text and structure of Article 8(2) make it evident that the right
to resort to UNCITRAL arbitration was provided only to cover a potential gap in the availability

of ICSID jurisdiction under Article 8(1) that might exist ‘[a]s long as the Republic of Venezuela

has not become a Contracting State of the [ICSID] Convention’ and ‘[i]f for any reason the
[ICSID] Additional Facility is not available.’’”* The Respondent explains that “the possibility of
such a gap existed in July 1994, when the Treaty was executed, because while Barbados and
Venezuela had both signed the ICSID Convention, the latter had not yet become a Contracting
Party which would be subject to ICSID arbitration upon entry into force of the Treaty.”? Upon
Venezuela’s ratification of the ICSID Convention, the above-mentioned interim period ended and

Article 8(2) of the Treaty ceased to be applicable.'°

The Respondent notes that the Parties agree that Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID
Convention on 24 January 2012 rendered ICSID arbitration under Article 8(1) unavailable.!! The
Parties further agree that ICSID Additional Facility arbitration under Article 8(2) ceased to be
available upon Venezuela’s ratification of the ICSID Convention in 1995.!? The Claimant
nevertheless seeks to avail itself of UNCITRAL arbitration under the second sentence of Article
8(2), which reads “[i]f for any reason the Additional Facility is not available the investor shall
have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under the rules of the United Nations

Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).”?

However, in the Respondent’s view, the only reasonable interpretation of Article 8(2) of the
Treaty is that the entire paragraph was intended to apply only during the pre-ICSID interim period.
In particular, the Respondent asserts that the specific reference to the ICSID Additional Facility
in this second sentence links it to the pre-ICSID period described in the first sentence.'* According
to the Respondent, there was significant uncertainty at the time that the Treaty was entered into

as to whether the ICSID Additional Facility would continue or be terminated. In addition, the

‘© Memorial, {{ 4-8. The Respondent clarifies that the potential interim period contemplated in Article 8(2) never
actually came into existence, since Venezuela’s ratification of the ICSID Convention became effective (in June
1995) prior to the entry into force of the Treaty (in October 1995).

rules of the Additional Facility remained untested and subject to possible modification, the first

case under those rules not having been brought until 1997.5

56. The Respondent supports its interpretation by reference to the “ordinary contextual interpretation”
of treaty terms called for in Article 31(1) of the VCLT and endorsed by international courts and
tribunals. '© This interpretation is also supported by the principles of integration and
contemporaneity in treaty interpretation,'’ as well as the object and purpose of the provision in

Contracting State.'* The Respondent adds that, given that the ordinary meaning of the terms taken

in context is clear, there is no need for resort to further supplementary means of interpretation."

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s interpretation of Article 8(2) ignores the link between
the first and second sentence of Article 8(2) and misconstrues the second sentence as a “‘catch-
all”, default arbitration provision. The Respondent contends that “[i]f the Contracting Parties to
the Treaty had intended to include UNCITRAL arbitration as a ‘catch-all’ arbitration option for
those cases in which neither ICSID nor the ICSID Additional Facility were available, they would
have referred to both ICSID and the ICSID Additional Facility and would have included this
option in a new Article 8(3) or otherwise separated it from the ICSID and ICSID Additional
Facility provisions, as other Venezuelan BITs do.””° According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s
interpretation implies that UNCITRAL arbitration would have become equally available
alongside ICSID arbitration upon Venezuela’s ratification of the ICSID Convention, which
clearly was not intended.?' The Respondent also contrasts the instant Treaty with various other
Venezuelan BITs which either (i) provide for ICSID arbitration” (and sometimes also for ICSID

Additional Facility arbitration in the interim),”* but do not contain an alternative arbitral forum in

purpose of frustrating the present Claimant’s possibility to submit its disputes to arbitration.”**

considerations cannot justify attributing a meaning to a treaty provision that is contrary to the

60. The Respondent distinguishes the cases cited by the Claimant to the contrary. The Respondent
asserts that, unlike BG v. Argentina, it is not trying to frustrate access to an international arbitral
forum that would otherwise be available to the Claimant.*! In addition, the Respondent argues
that Lemire v. Ukraine merely concerned an imprecise description of the agreed dispute settlement
mechanism which was resolved by reference to explicit language elsewhere in the arbitration
clause, unlike the situation faced with regard to UNCITRAL arbitration under Article 8 of the
present Treaty.*” Lastly, the Respondent considers that the result in Murphy v. Ecuador I is either
based on an unduly broad application of the effet utile principle or is restricted to the unique facts

of that case.

2. Claimant’s Position

61. The Claimant argues that Venezuela has provided, in Article 8(4) of the Treaty, its “express,
irrevocable, and unconditional consent” to arbitrate disputes arising under the Treaty.** This
essential consent to arbitration, the Claimant asserts, cannot be negated by any uncertainty
regarding the subsidiary procedural question of which forum and rules apply to a particular
dispute.* In any event, the Claimant submits that the text and structure of Article 8 of the Treaty
demonstrates that Venezuela consented to submit disputes to UNCITRAL arbitration. According

to the Claimant, if the Respondent’s interpretation were adopted, it would render the whole of

agreements should always be given their maximum possible effect, whereas its real object is merely (“quam
pereat’) to prevent them failing altogether.”). See also Hearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 23:10-30:13, 99:22-
101:13, 102:25-108:13 (“Venezuela does not deny that article 8 is part of the package negotiated and accepted by
Barbados and Venezuela. But this does not mean that arbitration in whatever circumstances and at whatever
moment is part of the object and purpose of the Treaty. [...] There is nothing meaningless in an interpretation
according to which the parties agreed upon the jurisdiction of an Arbitral Tribunal under the ICSID Convention
while making sure that in the time before Venezuela’s becoming a party, other fora would be available. The parties
were keen on the ICSID arbitration, not on any kind of arbitration in case one of them were to denounce ICSID.”),

Article 8 ineffective, contrary to the Contracting Parties’ intent and the object and purpose of the
Treaty. As such, the Claimant contends that it cannot be accepted as a good faith interpretation of

the Treaty.*°

62. Instead, the Claimant asserts that Articles 8(1) and 8(2) of the Treaty establish a hierarchy of
arbitral fora. In accordance with Article 8(1), ICSID arbitration is the applicable dispute
settlement mechanism as long as both Parties are Contracting States to the ICSID Convention.
Article 8(2) provides that, for the initial period until Venezuela became an ICSID Contracting
State, disputes would be submitted to the ICSID Additional Facility. Finally, Article 8(2) also
provides that “[i]f for any reason the Additional Facility is not available the investor shall have
the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under the [UNCITRAL] rules”. In this case, given
Venezuela’s ratification (in 1995) and subsequent denunciation of the ICSID Convention (in
2012), arbitration under both the ICSID Convention and Additional Facility Rules is unavailable.
As such, in the Claimant’s view, investors have the right to submit their disputes to UNCITRAL
arbitration.” The Claimant stresses that, unlike the claimant in Nova Scotia Power v. Venezuela
or the other cases on which Venezuela relies, this is not a case where the Claimant has failed to
observe the hierarchy of arbitral fora or failed to comply with mandatory pre-conditions to

arbitration.**

63. The Claimant contends that its interpretation is supported by the ordinary meaning of the terms
used in Article 8. The terms “unconditional consent” in Article 8(4), and “for any reason” and
“shall have the right” in Article 8(2), clearly establish that UNCITRAL arbitration is a
comprehensive and mandatory fall-back option which “is not conditioned or limited by whether
Venezuela ratified or withdrew from the ICSID Convention.” In particular, the Claimant points

out that the Contracting Parties added the otherwise superfluous phrase “for any reason” into the

According to the Claimant, the phrase “in accordance with the provisions of this article” included in Article 8(4)
merely refers to (i) the types of disputes that can be settled through arbitration as defined in Article 8(1); (ii) the
procedural rules which will govern such arbitrations as referred to in Article 8(1) and (2), and (iii) the permitted
scope of the arbitral award as set forth in Article 8(3). The Claimants therefore assert that Article 8(4) cannot be
construed as imposing conditions that eliminate the right to international arbitration as a whole. Hearing Transcript

phrase “if for any reason the Additional Facility is not available” (emphasis added).*° By contrast,
in the Claimant’s view, the Respondent’s interpretation “improperly conflates the two separate
sentences of Article 8.2 to import a temporal limitation from the first sentence as a condition on
the effect of the second”, leaving the phrases “for any reason” and “shall have the right”, as well

as the rest of the context of the provision, without meaning or effect.*!

64. The Claimant disputes the relevance of the Respondent’s comparison of Article 8 of the Treaty
with the dispute resolution provisions of other Venezuelan BITs, stating that “[c]omparing the
text of one treaty to another between different parties is not a method of interpretation specified
by the Vienna Convention, nor is it a favoured interpretive method of arbitral tribunals.”4? The
Claimant insists that the Barbados-Venezuela BIT is a standalone agreement negotiated by two
sovereign states whose meaning “cannot be determined in light of unrelated agreements
concluded between different parties at different times and in the context of different bilateral
relations.”8

65. Moreover, the Claimant argues that there is no consistent use of language or structure among the
Venezuelan BITs cited by the Respondent. For example, the Claimant states that the Portugal-
Venezuela BIT’s article on investor-State dispute settlement does not contain an express
statement of the States’ consent to arbitration and includes all of the provisions for submission to
ICSID, ICSID Additional Facility, and — if these are unavailable - UNCITRAL arbitration in the

same sub-paragraph.” Article 8 of the Czech Republic-Venezuela BIT includes a provision for

4 Portugal-Venezuela BIT, Article 8(2) (RLA-37):

If the dispute cannot be resolved through amicable means within a term of six months, counted from the
beginning of these consultations, it may be submitted, at the choice of the investor:

  

a) To the local courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made; or

b) To the arbitration of the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established
by the Washington Convention of March 18, 1965, in the event that both Contracting Parties are members

negotiation, a reference to ICSID arbitration and a secondary reference to the Additional Facility
in a single paragraph rather than in separate paragraphs.** The dispute settlement clause of the
Canada-Venezuela BIT sets out very detailed limitations, conditions, and procedural prerequisites
restricting the States’ consent to arbitration and omits the Barbados-Venezuela’s wording of “for
any reason” and “shall have the right” or any equivalent broad language.*° These examples,
according to the Claimant, contradict the Respondent’s assertions that, where an UNCITRAL fall-
back option is included, it is always set out in a separate section or paragraph, that the inclusion
of the “for any reason” and “shall have the right” language is not significant, and that statements

of unconditional consent to arbitration are included as a matter of course.*”

66. The Claimant also rejects the Respondent’s explanation of the reasons for including the
UNCITRAL option. The ICSID Administrative Council decided to continue the ICSID
Additional Facility indefinitely in 1984, over a decade before the conclusion of the Treaty.** The
Claimant further posits that “Venezuela’s scenario suggests that Barbados and Venezuela were
concerned enough about the possibility that an investor might be left without an arbitral forum

during the interim period between when Venezuela signed the BIT and when it became an ICSID

If, for whatever reason, neither ICSID nor the additional facility is available, the arbitration shall be
governed by the rules of arbitration of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
(UNCITRAL).

47 Rejoinder, 27. The Claimant also points to various additional differences in these and other Venezuelan BITs
cited by the Respondent. See Ecuador-Venezuela BIT, Article IX(3) (RLA-35); Lithuania-Venezuela BIT, Article
7 (RLA-36); Uruguay-Venezuela BIT, Article 9 (RLA-38); Iran-Venezuela BIT, Article 11(2) (RLA-26); Russia-

48 Counter-Memorial, { 31; Rejoinder, J 23. The Claimant adds that the Additional Facility is not a separate entity
within ICSID, but is instead an alternative set of rules “authorizing the ICSID Secretariat to administer certain
types of proceedings between States and foreign nationals which fall outside the scope of the Convention.” ICSID
website: http://icsid. worldbank.org/ “About ICSID, Dispute Settlement Facilities” (last visited June 16, 2014).

Contracting State that they not only included the Additional Facility as a temporary, conditional
alternative forum to ICSID, but also included UNCITRAL as a conditional, temporary, fall-back
alternative to the alternative of the Additional Facility. And yet, under this scenario, the
Contracting Parties were ostensibly not concerned with the possibility that at some time during
the minimum ten-year term of the BIT, ICSID might not be available, leaving investors without
any arbitral forum and Article 8 a nullity.”*? The Claimant asserts that it is far more likely that the

Contracting Parties intended the UNCITRAL option as a comprehensive default arbitral forum.*”

67. Additionally, in the Claimant’s view, the Respondent’s construction of Article 8 also runs counter
to the requirements of good faith interpretation under Article 31 of the VCLT. The provision of a
direct right of investors to arbitrate against the host State is, according to the Claimant, one of the
main aims of the Treaty, and of BITs in general. However, seeing as Venezuela’s withdrawal
from the ICSID Convention has foreclosed the option of ICSID arbitration, the Respondent’s
interpretation would deprive Barbadian investors of any arbitral forum whatsoever in which to
seek to enforce the Treaty’s substantive provisions. This would, the Claimant asserts, defeat the
Treaty’s object and purpose*! and render the whole of Article 8 a dead letter, in violation of the
interpretive principle of ut res magis valeat quam pereat (alternatively known as effet utile)
embodied in Article 31(1) of the VCLT.* It would also be an absurd and unreasonable result
contrary to Article 32 of the VCLT.** Moreover, the Claimant argues that “‘a State should not be
allowed to frustrate the investor’s access to arbitration to redress treaty violations through a

restrictive construction of the consent to arbitration provisions and its own acts in hindrance of

that access.”** The Claimant also points to the case of Lemire v. Ukraine as a prime example of a
tribunal not allowing supervening legal developments to defeat the true intent of Contracting
Parties, notwithstanding an imprecise arbitration clause.** The Claimant stresses the seriousness
of the present dispute and argues that Venezuela should similarly not be allowed to advance
opportunistic interpretations of the Treaty in order to deny the Claimant a right to international
arbitration and evade its substantive obligations under the Treaty, as it has systematically done

with other foreign investors as well.*°

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

The Claimant invokes Article 8 of the Treaty as the basis for the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. It
contends that Venezuela, through Article 8 of the Treaty, “irrevocably consented to arbitration of
disputes between it and nationals or companies of Barbados who invested in Venezuela”.>’

Meanwhile, the Respondent disputes the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear the merits of the case, as
in the Respondent’s view, its consent to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules ceased to be

applicable.

To resolve the dispute on jurisdiction, the Tribunal has to interpret Article 8 of the BIT, the full
text of which is reproduced above.** It consists of four paragraphs. The Parties’ arguments
addressed in particular three of them, namely paragraphs 1, 2 and 4. It seems that paragraph 3 of
Article 8, describing what the Tribunal has to determine in its award, is, except insofar as it
provides relevant context for the interpretation of the other three paragraphs of the article, of no

particular relevance for the task of the Tribunal at the present stage of the proceedings.

The Tribunal will therefore focus its attention on paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 in order to determine

whether they provide a basis for its jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate the Claimant’s claim.

The consent of Venezuela and Barbados to the submission of investment disputes by nationals of

the other Party to international arbitration is expressed in Article 8(4) which reads as follows:

Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as
referred to in paragraph | of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the

provisions of this Article.

This paragraph refers to the other provisions of the same Article as regards the category of
disputes which may be submitted to international arbitrations, as well as the available arbitral

fora.

Paragraph 1 defines the disputes as the ones between a Contracting Party and a national or a
company of the other Party concerning the investment. It envisages ICSID as the appropriate
arbitral forum for resolution of such disputes. It is useful to quote paragraph | again. It reads as

follows:

Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting
Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment
of the latter shall, at the request of the national concerned, be submitted to the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under

the [ICSID] Convention.

For the Centre to have jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the State which is
a party to the dispute and the State whose national is a party to the dispute, must both be
Contracting States to the ICSID Convention. As long as this condition is not fulfilled, the Centre
has no jurisdiction, even if the applicable BIT in force provides for resolution of investment

disputes before a Tribunal to be constituted under the ICSID Convention.

Barbados signed the ICSID Convention on 13 May 1981, ratified it on 1 November 1983, and it
entered into force in relation to this State on | December 1983. Since then Barbados has been a
Contracting State to the ICSID Convention. Venezuela signed the ICSID Convention on 18
August 1993, deposited its instrument of ratification on 2 May 1995, and it entered into force for
Venezuela on 1 June 1995. On 24 January 2012, Venezuela notified the depositary of the
denunciation of the ICSID Convention. This denunciation took effect, in accordance with Article

71 of the ICSID Convention, on 25 July 2012.

The Parties are in agreement that arbitration under the ICSID Convention was not available before
Venezuela became bound by the ICSID Convention on | June 1995 and is no longer available

after Venezuela ceased to be bound by it on 25 July 2012.

Barbados and Venezuela negotiated the Treaty in the early nineties and signed it on 15 July 1994,
which is after Venezuela signed the ICSID Convention, but before it deposited its instrument of
ratification in May 1995. This explains the inclusion of paragraph 2 in Article 8. That paragraph

reads as follows:

As long as the Republic of Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the Convention as
mentioned in paragraph | of this Article, disputes as referred to in that paragraph shall be
submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment disputes under the Rules
Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of
the Centre (Additional Facility Rules). If for any reason the Additional Facility is not available
the investor shall have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under the rules of the United

Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

The insertion of this paragraph into Article 8 shows, in the view of the Tribunal, that the Parties
wished to have an arbitral forum available immediately from the moment of the BIT’s entry into

force even if the ICSID Convention did not yet bind Venezuela.

The Parties differ on the interpretation and import of this paragraph.

Venezuela contends that paragraph 2 is limited to the temporary period before it became Party
(“a Contracting State”) to the ICSID Convention. Only for that period, the argument goes, did it
consent to the settlement of a dispute between it and a Barbadian investor through a tribunal
established and acting under the Rules Governing the Additional Facility. And only if the
Additional Facility, during that pre-ICSID period for Venezuela, was not available for any reason,
had Venezuela — according to its interpretation of the provision — consented to the submission of
the dispute to arbitration under the UNCITRAL rules. Venezuela denies that the provision
expresses its consent to have recourse to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules in the period

after it denounced the ICSID Convention in 2012.

In the Claimant’s view, UNCITRAL arbitration was not only available in the pre-ICSID period,
but is also available now, in the post-ICSID period, after Venezuela withdrew from the ICSID
Convention. In support of its interpretation, the Claimant invokes the purposes of the BIT, one of
which — in its contention — is to provide access to international arbitration. Further support is
sought by the Claimant in paragraph 4 of Article 8 of the Treaty, according to which “[e]ach
Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred
to in paragraph | of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of

this Article”.

In the Tribunal’s view, effect should be given to the text of paragraph 2 in its totality, in the
context in which it is placed within Article 8. The text is supposed to express the intention of the
Contracting Parties when they agreed on it. The introductory words of paragraph 2 clearly
describe the timeframe of its applicability. The words “[a]s long as the Republic of Venezuela
has not become a Contracting State of the [ICSID] Convention” leave no doubt that the Parties
had in mind the period prior to Venezuela becoming a Party to the ICSID Convention. The fact
that only Venezuela, and not Barbados, is expressly mentioned in this paragraph, clearly reveals
that this provision contemplated the pre-ICSID period. There is nothing in the formula used by
the Parties which would suggest that this provision was meant to also deal with the scenario in
which one of the Parties were to denounce the Convention and cease to be bound by it (as
Venezuela did in 2012). Had this been their intention, they could have easily used the formula “as
long as one of the Parties is not a Contracting State of the Convention”. It may be, and it is rather
very likely, that they had not even considered such a scenario, although under Article 71 of the
ICSID Convention any Contracting State has the right to denounce the Convention by written
notice. But it is not the task of the Tribunal to speculate, nor to read into the text what it does not

say.

The key issue in the context of paragraph 2 is the link between the first sentence and the second
one. The first provides for arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules “as long as the Republic
of Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the Convention”. The second specifies that
“if for any reason the Additional Facility is not available the investor shall have the right to submit
the dispute to arbitration under the [UNCITRAL] rules”. The second sentence, in the view of the
Tribunal, has to be read in relation to the first one. It does not constitute a self-standing provision.
The temporal limitation provided for in the first sentence of paragraph 2 thus also applies to the

second sentence.

The Additional Facility was an option in the pre-ICSID period. And only if “for any reason”
during this period it was not available did arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules provide a

substitute arbitral forum.

The Claimant accepts that it cannot submit the dispute to arbitration under the Additional Facility
Rules because the BIT only provides for arbitration under these rules during the time period prior

to Venezuela becoming a Contracting State to the Convention, not after Venezuela denounced it.

The Claimant nevertheless maintains that UNCITRAL arbitration is available in view of the fact

that the Additional Facility is no longer available. It emphasizes the words “if for any reason the

89.

90.

PCA Case No. 2013-34
Interim Award on Jurisdiction
Page 28 of 45

Additional Facility is not available”, arguing that in that case, it has the right to submit the dispute
to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules. In support of its position, it invokes paragraph 4 of
Article 8, emphasizing that each Contracting Party has given its unconditional consent to

arbitration.

In the view of the Tribunal, paragraph 4 does not strengthen the Claimant’s position. The
unconditional consent given by the Contracting Parties to the BIT is the consent to submit disputes
referred to in paragraph | of Article 8 to international arbitration “in accordance with the
provisions of this Article”. Although consent to international arbitration is expressed in
Article 8(4) and is still valid, in order to generate legal consequences in relation to different
arbitral fora, the conditions specified in paragraphs | and 2 of Article 8 have to be met. Paragraph
1 envisages ICSID arbitration, which at present is not available as Venezuela ceased to be bound
by the ICSID Convention on 25 July 2012. The continued validity of Venezuela’s consent to
arbitration under Article 8(4) as long as it is a Contracting Party to the BIT would provide for
ICSID jurisdiction in the future if Venezuela one day decides to accede once again to the ICSID
Convention. Paragraph 2, in the Tribunal’s interpretation, envisages situations which might have

arisen before Venezuela became a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention.

In view of the above, the Tribunal has to conclude that Article 8 alone does not provide a basis
for its jurisdiction in the case at hand as arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules was contemplated
by the BIT’s Contracting Parties for the period during which Venezuela had not yet become a
Contracting State of the ICSID Convention. The present arbitral proceedings were not instituted
before Venezuela became a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention, but only after it had

ceased to be one, following its denunciation of the Convention.

The Tribunal’s analysis, however, cannot stop here as the Claimant also relies on Article 3 of the
BIT, containing the MFN clause, as support for its contention that this Tribunal has jurisdiction

to hear the case. It is this issue to which the Tribunal now turns its attention.

THE APPLICATION OF THE MEN CLAUSE TO THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS IN
ARTICLE 8

1. Claimant’s Position

Even if the Tribunal were to adopt the Respondent’s interpretation of Article 8, the Claimant
argues that the MFN clause contained in Article 3 of the Treaty allows the Claimant to take

advantage of the dispute settlement provisions of other BITs to which Venezuela is a party,

PCA Case No. 2013-34
Interim Award on Jurisdiction
Page 29 of 45

including those which provide for an unrestricted choice of UNCITRAL arbitration or those
which the Respondent itself acknowledges provide for UNCITRAL arbitration as a catch-all
default dispute resolution option. The provisions of these BITs are, according to the Claimant,

more favorable because they provide investors with a choice of dispute resolution fora.

92. The Claimant notes that Article 3(3) of the Treaty expressly states that the MFN clause applies to
the dispute resolution provisions under the Treaty. According to the Claimant, the present
situation and Treaty are equivalent to those examined in Garanti Koza v. Turkmenistan, where
the tribunal found that it did not need to grapple with the debate over whether MFN clauses apply
to dispute settlement provisions generally, because the language of Article 3(3) required it to
apply MEN treatment to the dispute resolution provisions.*! The Garanti Koza tribunal further
found that, even if it were not possible to import consent to arbitration into a BIT that did not
provide for arbitration, “the essential consent of the State — the consent to resolve disputes with
U.K. investors by means of international arbitration — does not in this case need to be imported
by operation of the MFN clause, because that consent is contained in Article 8(1) of the BIT”, just

as it is, the Claimant contends, in Article 8(4) of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT.

93. The Claimant notes that there is no general rule against importing consent to arbitration through

an MEN clause.® Even if there were such a rule, however, the Claimant emphasizes the

distinction between consent to arbitration and the kind of arbitration or the conditions under which
the investor may submit the dispute to UNCITRAL arbitration, the latter being questions of
admissibility or procedure rather than consent. Tribunals which have found the MEN clause
under a BIT to apply to the BIT’s dispute resolution provisions have, the Claimant submits,
consistently held that MFN treatment allows an investor to avoid restrictive conditions on an
investor’s right to submit disputes to arbitration.® In the Claimant’s view, the only effect of MFN
treatment in this case would be to remove the temporal condition on the availability of
UNCITRAL arbitration, rather than to import a different “system of arbitration”.® Regardless,
the Claimant argues that Venezuela “clearly has no objection on principle or in practice to

UNCITRAL arbitration”, and cites the Renta 4 v. Russia tribunal’s rejection of similar arguments:

[D]ispute resolution mechanisms accepted by a State in various international instruments are
all legitimate in the eyes of that State. Some may be inherently more efficient. Others may be
more reliable in a particular context. Having options may be thought to be more “favoured” for
MEN purposes than not having them. It is not convincing for a State to argue in general terms
that it accepted a particular “system of arbitration” with respect to the nationals of one country
but did not so consent with respect to the nationals of another. The extension of commitments

is in the very nature of MFN clauses.°”

was recently rendered by a majority of an ICSID tribunal over the strong dissent of one of the

arbitrators, and which is both incorrect and distinguishable from the present case.

95. The Respondent agrees with the Claimant that the question of the applicability of the MFN
standard to dispute settlement is resolved by Article 3(3) of the Treaty, which clarifies that the
MEN standards set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 3 extend to the dispute settlement
provisions in Article 8. However, the Respondent asserts that “even when the MFN standard
applies to dispute settlement generally, the system of dispute settlement carefully negotiated by
the Contracting Parties cannot be replaced by another, neither negotiated, nor agreed, through the

mere invocation of the MFN clause.”

96. According to the Respondent, the Claimant seeks to impermissibly replace the specific “system
of arbitration” set forth in Article 8—where UNCITRAL arbitration was only contemplated for a
specific contingency—with “an entirely different mechanism” set forth in other Venezuelan
BITs.® The Respondent argues that the present situation must be distinguished from cases where
a claimant is merely attempting to bypass some formalities set forth in a treaty containing
indisputable consent to UNCITRAL arbitration. The Respondent repeats its earlier arguments that
the present Treaty contains no general consent to arbitration, only “an acceptance of arbitration
within the precise terms set out in article 8.””° In this context, the Respondent notes that the
acceptability of UNCITRAL arbitration in other Venezuelan BITs or in general is irrelevant:”!
the MEN clause cannot serve to import consent to arbitration where there is none in the basic

treaty.

97. In the Respondent’s view, this result derives from the principle that MFN clauses do not grant
investors rights that do not already exist under the basic treaty. For example, the Hochtief v.

Argentina tribunal held:

In the present case, it might be argued that the MFN clause requires that investors under the
Argentina-Germany BIT be given MEN treatment during the conduct of an arbitration but that
the MEN clause cannot create a right to go to arbitration where none otherwise exists under the
BIT. The argument can be put more generally: the MFN clause stipulates how investors must
be treated when they are exercising the rights given to them under the BIT but does not purport

to give them any further rights in addition to those given to them under the BIT.

In the view of the Tribunal, it cannot be assumed that Argentina and Germany intended that the
MEN clause should create wholly new rights where none otherwise existed under the
Argentina-Germany BIT. [...] The MFN clause is not a renvoi to a range of totally distinct
sources and systems of rights and duties: it is a principle applicable to the exercise of rights and

duties that are actually secured by the BIT in which the MEN clause is found.”

98. The Respondent also cites the dissenting opinion of Prof. Boisson de Chazournes in Garanti Koza

v. Turkmenistan:

In line with what the Maffezini v. Spain tribunal held, no investment award or decision has since
then decided that an MFN provision would allow the import of consent to ICSID arbitration
from another treaty. [...] The role of the MFN clause is not to substitute for a lack of consent,
but to ensure that the consent given is implemented in the most favourable manner to the
individual investor entitled to protection, as compared to the treatment given to other such

individuals in treaties with third countries. The National Grid v. Argentina tribunal correctly

 

noted that an MEN clause is not a basis for creating consent to ICSID arbitration when none

 

exists.

consent to ICSID through incorporation by reference in the frame of a treaty that does not allow

this, would have the effect of “replac[ing] a procedure specifically negotiated by parties with
an entirely different mechanism” or “system of arbitration”. It would involve a forum-shopping
attitude that bypasses the consent requirement of the Respondent while running against the

fundamental principles of international adjudication.”5

According to the Respondent, the majority decision in the Garanti Koza v. Turkmenistan case
was wrong, but was in any event premised on the idea that Turkmenistan had provided a general
or “essential consent” to arbitration in Article 8(1) of the UK-Turkmenistan BIT and a standing

offer of UNCITRAL arbitration in Article 8(2), neither of which is present in the instant Treaty.”

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal begins its analysis of the BIT’s provisions in Article 3 on MEN treatment” and its
implications with respect to Article 8 thereof, by referring to Article 3, paragraph 3. It leaves no
doubt that the MEN provisions under this BIT are applicable to the provisions on settlement of
disputes between one Contracting Party and nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party
as well. Paragraph 3 reads as follows: “The treatment provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above
shall apply to the provision of Articles 1 to 11 of this Agreement”. Article 8 thus features among

the Articles to the provisions of which the MEN treatment shall apply.

This is not disputed by the Respondent, who, while observing that “investment tribunals are
divided as to the applicability of MFN [clauses] to dispute settlement provisions”, accepts that
“in this case, [...] the applicability of the MFN standards to dispute settlement is resolved by the
BIT itself.””°

The Tribunal thus need not pronounce itself on the applicability of MFN clauses to arbitration
clauses or dispute settlement provisions in general, in particular in situations when the MFN
clause is silent on the scope of its applicability. Arbitral tribunals remain deeply divided on this

issue.”” Nor does the Tribunal have to engage in an analysis as to whether the term “treatment” in

” The Tribunal notes that these divergencies between different Tribunals stem mostly from the fact that the BITs
these Tribunals had to interpret remained silent on the applicability of the MFN clauses to investor-State dispute
settlement procedures. That is the case e.g. of the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT, the Argentina~-Germany BIT
or the Bulgaria-Germany BIT. For that reason this Tribunal does not consider awards or decisions pursuant to such

the text of Article 8 of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT covers only substantive standards of
treatment, or includes also procedural rights, including the right to initiate arbitral proceedings.”*
Article 3 in its paragraph (3) is clear that “[t]he treatment provided for” in the two paragraphs
thereof shall apply also to the provisions of Article 8. As the Study Group of the International
Law Commission on the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, having studied the issue between 2009
and 2015, observed in its Final Report “[t]he point [whether MFN provisions are capable of
applying to the dispute settlement provisions of the BITs] is essentially one of party autonomy;
the parties to a BIT can, if they wish, include the conditions for access to dispute settlement within
the scope of coverage of an MEN provision. The question in each case is whether they have done
so.” Venezuela and Barbados have done so in their BIT; they have agreed expressis verbis that
the MEN treatment clause shall apply to Article 8, i.e., to dispute settlement provisions and
conditions for resorting to international arbitration thereunder. Therefore, this Tribunal has no
other choice than to apply and enforce these provisions “in accordance with their terms pursuant
to the principle of pacta sunt servanda”.® The majority believes that it must give bona fide effect

to the provisions agreed by the Parties in their BIT, and not to empty Article 3(3) of its meaning,

BITs (e.g., ICS v. Argentina, supra note 17; Wintershall v. Argentina, supra note 17; Daimler v. Argentina, supra
note 42; Hochtief v. Argentina, supra note 60; ST-AD v. Bulgaria) as relevant for its interpretation and application
of Articles 3 and 8 of the Venezuela-Barbados BIT, since this Tribunal has a duty to apply the provisions of
Article 3 to Article 8.

 

*8 This is yet another divisive issue. The Tribunal, however, notes that some tribunals which interpreted MFN
clauses in the BITs not expressly providing for the applicability of the MFN clause to the investor-State dispute
settlement procedures have concluded that “[a]n investor’s entitlement to resort to arbitration under a BIT must be
construed as an integral part of the treatment accorded to [the investor].” Le Chéque Déjeuner and C.D Holding

thereby rendering it inapplicable to Article 8 as is the view preferred in the attached dissenting

opinion.

103. Article 3(3) of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT is almost identical to the United Kingdom Model BIT
(2008), the only difference being that in the UK Model Treaty Article 3(3) starts with the words
“for the avoidance of doubt it is confirmed that” which are then followed by the words identical
with the ones used by Barbados and Venezuela in their BIT, namely “the treatment provided for in
paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provisions of Articles | to 12 of this Agreement”.
This kind of provision has been used frequently in the BITs concluded by the United Kingdom since
1990/1991.*! It may be that this example “inspired” Barbados and Venezuela during the
negotiations of their BIT under consideration in the present case. Be that as it may, what is important
is the fact that, as the commentators of the UK Model BIT explain, “[w]here Article 3(3) is included,
it therefore provides an answer to the controversial question whether the MEN provision also applies

82

to procedural issues such as investor-State dispute settlement.

104. The Tribunal observes that Article 3(1) deals with treatment of “investments”, while Article 3(2)
deals with treatment of “nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party” (i.e., investors).
The right to submit a dispute to arbitration is a right accorded by Article 8 of the BIT, under the
conditions specified therein, to an “investor”. Article 8(2) uses the expression “the investor shall
have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration.” It follows that MFN treatment can extend to
dispute settkement provisions only through the operation of Article 3(2) of the Treaty.
“Investment” as such has no procedural rights, therefore Article 3(1) is without relevance for the

purpose of the Tribunal’s inquiry into its jurisdiction.

105. It is now for the Tribunal to determine how Article 3(2) impacts the provisions of Article 8 on
settlement of disputes between an investor and a State. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent
that the MEN clause cannot serve the purpose of importing consent to arbitration when none exists

under the BIT between Barbados and Venezuela.* It also appears that the Claimant is arguing

that it does not seek to import consent to arbitration in the present case from another BIT

concluded by Venezuela with a third State.**

The question which has to be answered is whether Venezuela has given its consent to international

arbitration for disputes with Barbadian investors in the BIT at hand.

It is necessary to recall Article 8(4) of the BIT. It provides that “[e]ach Contracting Party hereby
gives its unconditional consent to submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph | of this article
to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this article”. Venezuela thus has
given its unconditional consent to international arbitration, but of course, with the caveat “in
accordance with the provisions of Article 8.” The Tribunal earlier analyzed Article 8° and reached
its conclusion that “arbitration under UNCITRAL Rules was agreed to by the BIT’s Contracting
Parties for the period during which Venezuela had not yet become a Contracting State of the ICSID

Convention”.*® Without Article 3 of the BIT, this would have been the end of the exercise.

Article 3(3), however, requires the Tribunal to apply “the treatment provided for in paragraph
[...] (2) [...] to the provisions of” Article 8 of the BIT. The principle of effectiveness calls for
giving effect to Article 3(2).

There can be no doubt that Venezuela has given its consent, as it is stipulated in Article 8(4) —
“its unconditional consent” — to the submission of investment disputes with Barbadian investors
to international arbitration. Article 8(4), by using the expression “in accordance with the
provisions of this Article”, makes such submission of disputes to international arbitration subject
to the conditions specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 8. These conditions determine the
arbitration forum to which a dispute can be submitted, either ICSID, the ICSID Additional Facility,
or arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules. Yet, the fact remains that Article 8(4) expresses the
Contracting Parties’ overall “unconditional consent” to international arbitration. Venezuela has
given in Article 8 one consent to international arbitration, not three different consents (one to
ICSID arbitration, one to ICSID Additional Facility arbitration and one to ad hoc arbitration under
UNCITRAL Rules). That consent covers three different arbitral fora (ICSID, Additional Facility,
UNCITRAL) under the conditions specified in Article 8.

110. The Tribunal notes that otherwise Article 8(4) would serve no other useful purpose as it would

111.

have been sufficient for the Contracting Parties to limit Article 8 just to its first three paragraphs.
Paragraph | would have provided for arbitration under the ICSID Convention, while paragraph 2
would have covered scenarios prior to Venezuela’s becoming Party to the ICSID Convention.
There is a presumption that the Parties, by including a specific paragraph in Article 8, namely
paragraph 4, by which they give their “unconditional consent to the submission of disputes
[‘between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party
concerning an obligation of the former under this [BIT] in relation to an investment of the latter’ ]*’
to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article”, intended to give a
meaning to this paragraph, or in other words, this paragraph has to produce the legal effects

intended by the Parties.

In the view of the Tribunal, Article 8(4) expresses — as long as the BIT is in force, and it is not
disputed that it is still in force — each Contracting Party’s consent to submission of investment
disputes with nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to international arbitration.
There is thus no question of importing Venezuela’s consent to international arbitration with
Barbadian investors through the operation of Article 3(2) of the BIT from another of Venezuela’s
BITs concluded with a third State. The question rather is that of the conditions for resorting to
international arbitration. Venezuela, by withdrawing from the ICSID Convention, has not
withdrawn its consent to international arbitration, expressed in Article 8(4) of the BIT. The
consent is still there and valid. Venezuela’s withdrawal from the ICSID Convention prevents
Barbadian investors from instituting arbitral proceedings under Article 8(1) of the BIT as doing
so is conditioned, pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, upon Venezuela being a
Contracting State to the ICSID Convention. The door to ICSID arbitration has thus been shut by
Venezuela. However, if one day Venezuela accepts the Convention anew as it may, the door to
ICSID arbitration will reopen since so long as the consent to international arbitration under the
BIT has not been withdrawn, it continues to be in place. Without this consent this would not be
possible because, as the last preambular paragraph of the ICSID Convention confirms “no
Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification acceptance or approval of this
Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular

dispute to . . . arbitration.”

87 These are the words taken from Article 8(1) substituted for the phrase “as referred to in paragraph | of this

Article” used in Article 8(4).

PCA Case No. 2013-34

Page 38 of 45

112. Article 8 contains only conditions determining which one of the three arbitral fora mentioned
therein may be available. It sets forth no other conditions such as those which are provided for in
anumber of other BITs, e.g., the requirement that an investor litigate a dispute before the domestic
courts of the host State for a specific duration prior to initiating arbitral proceedings or the
requirement that an investor make a bona fide attempt to settle the dispute through negotiations
for a specified period of time (the so-called “cooling-off” period) before instituting arbitral
proceedings. Therefore, in the view of the Tribunal, since Venezuela and Barbados agreed in
Article 3 of their BIT that the MFN treatment clause shall apply to dispute settlement procedures
under Article 8, and since the Respondent admits as much, the MFN treatment is relevant to the

application of the conditions under which an arbitral forum may be seised.

113. Recourse to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules is subject to a temporal condition, namely
that it has been envisaged for the period prior to Venezuela becoming a Contracting State of the

ICSID Convention if the Additional Facility was not available for any reason.

114. It is in the nature of an MFN clause that the “treatment accorded by the granting State to the
beneficiary State, or to persons [...] in a determined relationship with that State” is “not less
favourable than treatment extended by the granting State to a third State or to persons [...] in the
same relationship with that third State”.**

115. The Claimant asserts that a number of the BITs concluded by Venezuela with third States provide
more favourable terms to investors, including Venezuela’s BITs with Belarus, Cuba, Iran, the
Russian Federation, Vietnam, Canada, the Czech Republic, Ecuador, Lithuania, Portugal and
Uruguay.® It is not necessary for the Tribunal to analyze all these BITs. It is sufficient that one
of them provides for more favourable treatment of investors in relation to the conditions under
which they can have recourse to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules than Barbadian investors.
If, in one of these BITs, the temporal condition for recourse to arbitration under the UNCITRAL
Rules is less stringent, or — in other words — more favourable to investors than the one in the
Barbados-Venezuela BIT, then Barbadian investors relying on Article 3(2) of the BIT can claim
not to be subjected to the conditions in Article 8(2) of the BIT as they appear therein, but to the

conditions more favorable to the investor from the third State.

116. One of the treaties invoked is the BIT which Venezuela concluded with Ecuador on
18 November 1993.” Article IX, devoted to settlement of disputes between an investor and the
Contracting Party in which the investment was made, provides for international arbitration and in
that context for three possible arbitral fora, namely ICSID, an ICSID Additional Facility and an ad
hoc arbitral tribunal under the UNCITRAL Rules, like Article 8 of the Venezuela-Barbados BIT. It

is useful to reproduce here the full text of Article IX of the Venezuela-Ecuador BIT. It reads:

Article IX
Settlement of disputes between an investor

and the Contracting Party in which the investment was made

1. Any dispute between an investor of a Contracting Party and the other Contracting
Party concerning implementation by the latter of the provisions of this Agreement shall, to the

extent possible, be settled by means of amicable consultations.

2. If the dispute cannot be settled within six months of the time it was initiated by one

of the Parties, it may be submitted, at the request of the investor, to:
— The competent courts of the Contracting Party, in whose territory the investment was made; or
— International arbitration, on the terms laid down in paragraph 3.

Once an investor has submitted the dispute to the courts of the Contracting Party in
question or to international arbitration, the choice of one or other of those procedures shall be

final.

3. If the investor decides to have recourse to arbitration, the dispute shall be submitted
to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established by the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other
States, which was opened for signature in Washington, D.C., on 18 March 1965, once both
States Parties to this Agreement have acceded to the Convention. Until such condition has been
met, each Contracting Party agrees that the dispute shall be submitted to arbitration in
accordance with the rules of the Additional Facility of ICSID for the Administration of

Conciliation, Arbitration and Fact-Finding Proceedings.

If for any reason ICSID or its Additional Facility is not available, the dispute shall be
submitted, at the request of the investor, to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal established under the

Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

4. The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach of this
Agreement by the Contracting Party, whether such breach has caused harm to the investor and,

if such is the case, the amount of compensation which is appropriate.

5. Arbitral awards shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each

Contracting Party shall execute them in accordance with its legislation.

Interim Award on Jurisdiction
Page 41 of 45

The Tribunal notes that paragraph 2 gives the investor a choice, which once made becomes final,
to submit a dispute which could not be settled amicably within six months, either to the competent
courts of the host State or to international arbitration. In relation to international arbitration the
provision specifies that such submission of a dispute shall be “on the terms laid down in

paragraph 3”.

In the view of the Tribunal, paragraph 2 of Article IX of the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT expresses
the consent of these two States to international (investment) arbitration similarly to how such
consent is given in Article 8(4) of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT, albeit in the latter it is expressed
in an even more emphatic way (“Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent”).
Further the Tribunal does not see any material or substantive difference in the formulas used in
Article 8(4) (“consent [...] to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this
Article”) and in Article [X(2) (“[i]nternational arbitration, on the terms laid down in paragraph 3”).

Both refer to the conditions specified in the provisions referred to therein.

The Tribunal has analyzed above” the conditions set forth in Article 8 of the Barbados-Venezuela
BIT, more precisely in paragraphs | and 2 thereof. Moving now to the terms, or in other words
the conditions, laid down in paragraph 3 of Article IX of the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT, the

Tribunal wishes to make several observations.

First, it provides for recourse to ICSID arbitration “once both States Parties to the [BIT] have
acceded to the [ICSID] Convention”. It is worth recalling that the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT was
signed on 18 November 1993 when only Ecuador was a party to the ICSID Convention,” while
Venezuela was only a signatory State but not yet a Contracting Party to the ICSID Convention.™*
The exact same situation of Venezuela not being a Party to the ICSID Convention continued when

it signed the BIT with Barbados a few months later, on 15 July 1994.°°

Second, under these same circumstances, both BITs now under the Tribunal’s focus, provide for
the ICSID Additional Facility. The Tribunal has already interpreted the words “[a]s long as [...]

Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the [ICSID] Convention”, in Article 8(2) of the

® See supra, fl 74-89.

°3 Ecuador signed the Convention on 15 January 1986 and deposited its instrument of ratification on the same
date. The Convention entered into force for Ecuador on 14 February 1987.

°4 Venezuela signed the Convention on 18 August 1993 and deposited its instrument of ratification on 2 May 1995.
The Convention entered into force for Venezuela on 1 June 1995.

°5 See supra, {3 and note 1, as well as 76.

Page 42 of 45

Barbados-Venezuela BIT as “leav[ing] no doubt that the Parties had in mind the period prior to
Venezuela becoming a Party to the ICSID Convention”.” The Tribunal also noted the agreement
of the Parties to the dispute on this point in relation to the availability of the ICSID Additional
Facility only in Venezuela’s pre-ICSID period.*’ The Ecuador-Venezuela BIT provides in
Article [X(3) that “[uJntil such condition has been met [i.e., until both Contracting Parties to the
BIT ‘have acceded to the [ICSID] Convention’], each Contracting Party agrees that the dispute
shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the Additional Facility of ICSID”. In the view
of the Tribunal, the expression “until such condition has been met” means, in the circumstances
prevailing at the moment of signing the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT, until Venezuela has become a
Party to the ICSID Convention, or in other words it covers the pre-ICSID period. Accordingly,
the Tribunal does not see any material difference in the temporal scope of the expressions “[a]s
long as... Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the [ICSID] Convention” and
“[ujntil such condition has been met [i-e., until ‘both States Parties to the [BIT] have acceded to

the [ICSID] Convention’]”.

122. The Tribunal pauses here to observe that investors from Ecuador and from Barbados in Venezuela,
in relation to international arbitration with Venezuela before an ICSID Tribunal or under the
Additional Facility Rules, were in the same situation. ICSID became available only once
Venezuela ratified the ICSID Convention. Until that moment, in the pre-ICSID period for
Venezuela, they could have instituted arbitral proceedings under the Additional Facility Rules,

but not once that pre-ICSID period was terminated.

123. Third, both BITs also contemplate the possibility of seizing an ad hoc arbitral tribunal under the
UNCITRAL Rules. But there the similarity ends. The Barbados-Venezuela BIT provides that “[i]f
for any reason Additional Facility is not available the investor shall have the right to submit the
dispute to arbitration under the [UNCITRAL Rules]”. This option is envisaged in Article 8(2)
which the Tribunal interpreted to the effect that its introductory words “[a]s long as [...]
Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the [ICSID] Convention” apply also in relation

to the availability of arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules.”

124. The structure of Article [X(3) of the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT differs from paragraph 2 of Article 8
of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT. Article IX(3) is divided into two distinct subparagraphs. The

% See supra, | 83.
°7 See supra, Wl 81, 86.
%8 See supra WI 83-84.

PCA Case No. 2013-34
Interim Award on Jurisdiction
Page 43 of 45

original Spanish text makes this abundantly clear by not only separating the two subparagraphs,
but also by opening the second one with a hyphen. The second subparagraph gives a right to the
investor to submit a dispute to an ad hoc tribunal under the UNCITRAL Rules not only when the
Additional Facility is for any reason not available, but also when ICSID itself is for any reason

not available. This is a critical difference in comparison with the Barbados-Venezuela BIT.

125. Ecuador and Venezuela knew when they concluded their BIT that ICSID would be available
“once both States Parties to this [BIT] have acceded to the [ICSID] Convention”, i.e., once
Venezuela ratified it, as Ecuador had already been a Party to the ICSID Convention. For the period
prior to Venezuela’s ratification of the ICSID Convention, as the words “[u]ntil such condition
has been met” used in the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article IX clearly indicate, the
Additional Facility was the substitute forum. The words in the separate second subparagraph “[i]f
for any reason ICSID [...] is not available” cannot be limited just to one single reason, namely to
Venezuela becoming a Party to the ICSID Convention through its ratification, since that reason
was already specifically addressed in subparagraph | of Article IX and the “remedy” provided for
therein in the form of the Additional Facility. “Any reason” in relation to the ICSID has to have
a broader meaning, covering also a situation when the ICSID, having become open to an
Ecuadorian investor following Venezuela’s ratification of the ICSID Convention, would later be
unavailable for “any reason”, for instance as a result of denunciation of that Convention pursuant

to its Article 71.

126. The Tribunal reads the condition “[i]f for any reason ICSID or its Additional Facility is not
available”? for recourse to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules as a cumulative one, meaning
that neither ICSID nor its Additional Facility is available. The Additional Facility is not available
since, in the view of the Tribunal, it was contemplated for the period before Venezuela ratified
the ICSID Convention and thus joined Ecuador, among other States, as a Contracting Party thereto.
That is, in the Tribunal’s view, the meaning of the phrase “[uJntil such condition has been met”
in Article [X(3). In any event, irrespective of the temporal scope of that phrase, the Additional
Facility is not available to investors from Ecuador under the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT since both
countries denounced the ICSID Convention and are no longer Contracting Parties to it. Ecuador
did so on 6 July 2009 with effect, under Article 71 of the ICSID Convention, as of 7 January 2010.
Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention on 24 January 2012 took effect on

25 July 2012. Nor is ICSID available for Ecuadorian investors in investment disputes with

Venezuela. However, Ecuadorian investors may still have recourse to UNCITRAL arbitration
since neither ICSID nor the Additional Facility is available. Therefore, they benefit from more

favorable treatment than investors from Barbados.

Venezuela in its BIT with Ecuador in Article IX(2) agreed to international arbitration with
Ecuadorian investors, on the terms laid down in paragraph 3. Venezuela, in relation to investors
from Barbados, has given in Article 8(4) its unconditional consent to international arbitration in
accordance with the provisions of that Article. Both Articles provide for three arbitral fora ICSID,
Additional Facility, UNCITRAL arbitration) under the conditions specified therein. The
conditions under which Ecuadorian investors have a right to recourse to an UNCITRAL

arbitration are more favorable than the conditions for investors from Barbados.

However, in Article 3(2) of its BIT with Barbados Venezuela accepted an obligation not to subject
nationals or companies from Barbados to treatment less favorable than that which it accords to
nationals or companies of any third State. Ecuador is such a third State. Under Article 3(3) of the
Barbados-Venezuela BIT such treatment shall also apply, beyond any doubt, to the settlement of
disputes with investors who are nationals of Barbados. Venezuela, having given its consent to
international arbitration, shall accept that Barbados’ investors shall have recourse to UNCITRAL
arbitration, which is listed in Article 8(2) of the BIT, under conditions which are not less favorable
than the conditions under which Ecuadorian investors have such recourse to UNCITRAL

arbitration pursuant to Article IX of the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT.

It follows that investors from Barbados, relying on Article 3(2) of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT,
are entitled to submit their investment disputes with Venezuela in accordance with its Article 8

on the same conditions as investors from Ecuador.

Accordingly, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that, having regard to Article 3(2) of the BIT
and Article IX of the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT, the objection of the Respondent that the Tribunal

lacks jurisdiction ratione voluntatis has to be rejected.
