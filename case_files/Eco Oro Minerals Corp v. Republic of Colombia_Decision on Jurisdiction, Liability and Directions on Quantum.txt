INTRODUCTION!

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement
of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of Section B of Chapter
Eight of the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia, signed
on 21 November 2008 and which entered into force on 15 August 2011 (the “FTA” or
the “Treaty”),? and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965, which entered into force on
14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

A. THE PARTIES

2.

The claimant is Eco Oro Minerals Corp. (formerly known as Greystar Resources Limited
(“Greystar’)), a corporation constituted under the laws of British Columbia, Canada, and
trading publicly on the Canadian Securities Exchange (formerly, on the Toronto Stock
Exchange), with its registered address at Suite 300-1055 West Hastings Street, Vancouver,
BC V6E 2E9, Canada (“Eco Oro” or the “Claimant”).?

The respondent is the Republic of Colombia, a sovereign State (“Colombia” or

the “Respondent”).

The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties”. The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and
entered into force on 15 August 2011) (Exhibit C-22; see also Exhibit R-137); and Circular No. 024 of the
Directorate of Foreign Commerce of the Ministry of Commerce concerning the entry into force of the Treaty
(3 August 2011) (Exhibit C-21). See also Canada-Colombia Environment Agreement (also signed on
21 November 2008 and in force on 15 August 2011) (Exhibit R-138).

For ease of reference, the Tribunal refers to the Claimant as Eco Oro even when referring to actions undertaken.
before it had changed its name from Greystar to Eco Oro.

B. BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE

5.

This dispute relates to measures adopted by the Respondent in connection with the paramo
ecosystem in Santurban, which allegedly have deprived Eco Oro of its mining rights under
a concession contract for the exploration and exploitation of a deposit of gold, silver,
chromium, zinc, copper, tin, lead, manganese, precious metals and associated minerals
entered into on 8 February 2007 between Eco Oro and INGEOMINAS. The contract relates
to the Angostura gold and silver deposit located in the Soto Norte region of the department
of Santander, within the Vetas-California gold district: Concession Contract 3452

(“Concession 3452” or the “Concession”).

The Claimant alleges that Colombia has breached its obligations under (i) Article 805 of the
FTA by means of the unlawful, creeping and indirect expropriation of its investment; and
(ii) Article 811 of the FTA by failing to accord Eco Oro’s investment the minimum standard
of treatment (“MST”). The Claimant seeks full reparation for what it deems to be the
destruction of its investment in Colombia, claiming compensation for damage caused as a
result of the Respondent’s breaches and violations of the FTA and international law in an
amount of USD 696 million, plus pre-award and post-award interest. The Respondent
submits that Eco Oro’s claims ought to be dismissed in their entirety as the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction over this dispute and there is no basis of liability accruing to Colombia under

the FTA.

Save as specified otherwise, the versions of the exhibits and relevant translations into English
thereof referred to by the Tribunal in this decision are the ones provided by the Parties via
the online case document repository (Box). In cases where the Parties have provided
different translations of the same document or portion thereof, a table containing both

translations is used.

The Tribunal has given careful consideration to the extensive factual and legal arguments
presented by the Parties in their written and oral submissions, and taken full account of the
submissions from the Government of Canada. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary
to reiterate all such arguments, but rather addresses those arguments which it considers most

relevant for its decisions. The Tribunal’s reasons, without repeating all the arguments

2/387

advanced by the Parties, address what it considers to be the determinative factors required
to decide on the requests of the Parties. Where the Tribunal considers, however, that a brief
repetition of certain aspects of its conclusions in the context of particular issues is
appropriate, it has done so. The Tribunal’s analysis shall not be limited to authorities referred

to by the Parties.*

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A.

INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION

On 7 March 2016, the Claimant wrote to the Respondent, notifying it pursuant to
Article 821(2)(c) of the FTA of the claims Eco Oro intended to submit to international
arbitration (“Notice of Intent”).> In its Notice of Intent, the Claimant, inter alia, proposed
to hold amicable consultations with Government representatives, with a view to establishing

a constructive dialogue permitting to reach a negotiated solution to the dispute.

On 8 December 2016, ICSID received a request for arbitration from the Claimant against

Colombia, accompanied by exhibits C-001 to C-061 (the “Request for Arbitration”).

On 15 December 2016, the Respondent submitted to the Centre a copy of a Notice of
Denial of Benefits sent on that same date to the Claimant by which Colombia stated that it
denied the benefits of Chapter 8 of the FTA to Eco Oro and its alleged investments on the
basis of Article 814(2) of the FTA.°

By letter of 20 December 2016, the ICSID Secretariat requested additional information from

Eco Oro concerning its Request for Arbitration, which was provided on 22 December 2016.

On 29 December 2016, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for

Arbitration, as supplemented on 22 December 2016, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the

See, e.g., Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award
(22 September 2014) (Exhibit RL-96), para. 568, fn. 460.

Notice of intent to submit the claim to arbitration (7 March 2016) (Exhibit C-48).

the Acting Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal
as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the

Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

B. CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

14.

The Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the
ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be
appointed by each Party, and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of
the Parties. Pursuant to the Parties’ agreed method of constitution, failing an agreement of
the Parties on the presiding arbitrator, she or he would be appointed by the Secretary-General
of ICSID, without limitation to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators.

The Tribunal is composed of:

On 11 September 2017 and in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure
for Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID Arbitration Rules”), the Secretary-General
notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the
Arbitral Tribunal (the “Tribunal’”) was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that

date. Ms. Ana Constanza Conover Blancas, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve

as Secretary of the Tribunal.

C. INITIAL PROCEDURAL STEPS

17.

On 13 September 2017, ICSID received a letter from the Comité para la Defensa del Agua
y el Paéramo de Santurbdn, the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), the
Inter-American Association for the Defense of the Environment (AIDA), MiningWatch
Canada, the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and the Centre for Research on Multinational
Corporations (SOMO) (together, the “Petitioners”) addressed to the Tribunal. In their letter,
the Petitioners advised the Tribunal that one or more of them anticipated to submit a request
for leave to participate in the arbitration as amici curiae. The Petitioners further requested
the Tribunal to (i) make available to them the documents submitted to or issued by the
Tribunal in the proceeding by establishing procedures for the publication of case materials,
and (ii) establish a timetable for requesting leave for amici intervention, in order to avoid
disrupting the proceedings. On 14 September 2017, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted

a copy of the Petitioner’s letter to the Tribunal and the Parties.

The Parties were notified on 8 March 2021 of the fact that Professor Sands had been granted the nationality

of Mauritius.

5/387

On 22 September 2017, in response to an invitation to provide comments from the Tribunal,

each Party filed observations on the Petitioners’ letter of 13 September 2017.

On 10 October 2017, the Secretary of the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, on behalf of the
President of the Tribunal, to inquire whether the Parties would agree to the appointment of
Mr. Joao Vilhena Valério as an assistant to the President of the Tribunal in this case.
By communications of 13 and 16 October 2017, the Parties confirmed their agreement on
the appointment of Mr. Vilhena Valério. On 30 October 2017, the Secretary of the Tribunal
transmitted a copy of Mr. Vilhena Valério’s signed declaration of independence and

impartiality to the Parties.

D. First SESSION AND WRITTEN PHASE OF THE PROCEEDINGS

20.

21.

22.

On 21 November 2017, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held

a first session with the Parties by telephone conference.

On 30 November 2017, following the first session, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. 1, recording the Parties’ agreements on procedural matters and the decision of
the Tribunal on the disputed issues. Procedural Order No. | established, inter alia, that: the
applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, except to the extent
modified by Section B of Chapter Eight (Investment) of the FTA and supplemented by any
rules adopted by the Joint Commission of the Free Trade Agreement Between the Republic
of Colombia and Canada (the “Commission’”) under Articles 822(2), 832, and 2001(3)(a) of
the FTA; the procedural languages would be English and Spanish; the Tribunal’s award and
procedural orders, the notice of intent and the Request for Arbitration would be publicly
available subject to the deletion of confidential information; and that the place of the
proceeding would be Washington, D.C. Procedural Order No. | also set out three scenarios
for procedural timetables for the written phase, including time limits for the filing of

applications from non-disputing parties.

On 20 March 2018, the Claimant filed a Memorial on the Merits dated 19 March 2018
(the “Claimant’s Memorial’), with exhibits C-62 to C-279 and legal authorities

CL-1 to CL-91. The pleading was also accompanied by two witness statements and two

6/387

27.

expert reports, as follows: (i) Witness Statement of Mr. Mark Moseley-Williams dated
19 March 2018 (“First Moseley-Williams Statement”); (ii) Witness Statement of
Mr. Wilmer Gonzalez Aldana dated 19 March 2018 (“First Gonzalez Aldana Statement”);
(iii) Expert report of Behre Dolbear titled “Report on Eco Oro Minerals Corporation’s
Angostura Gold Project — Santander Department, Colombia” dated 19 March 2018,
prepared by Mr. Bernard J. Guarnera and Dr. Robert E. Cameron (“First Behre Dolbear
Report”), with supporting documents BD-1 to BD-36; and (iv) Expert report of Compass
Lexecon titled “Valuation Assessment of the Angostura Project’ dated 19 March 2018,
prepared by Messrs. Pablo T. Spiller and Santiago Dellepiane A. (“First Compass Lexecon
Report”), with supporting documents CLEX-1 to CLEX-66.

On 18 April 2018, the Respondent filed a request to address the objections to jurisdiction as
a preliminary question (the “Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation”) accompanied by

exhibits R-1 to R-20 and legal authorities RL-1 to RL-30.

On 18 May 2018, the Claimant filed a response to the Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation
(the “Claimant’s Response on Bifurcation”), accompanied by exhibits C-280 to C-300 and
legal authorities CL-92 to CL-128.

On 4 June 2018, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it was inclined to join the jurisdictional
objections to the merits and that the majority of the Tribunal had been discussing whether
the most efficient conduct of the proceeding could lead it to bifurcate the damages phase.
The Parties were invited to submit observations on this proposal, which were received on

15 June 2018.

On 28 June 2018, following additional exchanges between the Parties, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 2, dismissing the Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation and joining
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections and issues related to quantum to the merits phase of

the proceeding.

By emails of 17 and 20 August 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed

to propose to the Tribunal amendments to Annex A to Procedural Order No. | concerning

7/387

28.

29.

30.

31.

32.

the timetable for the remaining procedural steps in the arbitration. In addition, the Parties

proposed to reserve the last two weeks of January 2020 to hold an oral hearing.

By emails of 24 August 2018, in response to a consultation from the Tribunal, the Parties
confirmed their availability to hold the pre-hearing organizational meeting set out in
Section 20 of Procedural Order No. 1 on 20 December 2019, as well as their agreement to

hold the hearing in Washington, D.C.

On 29 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, by which it approved the
amendments to the procedural calendar proposed by the Parties on 17 and 20 August 2018,

including the hearing dates and the date for the pre-hearing organizational meeting.

By letter of 26 September 2018, the Respondent filed a request for a 60-day extension of the
deadline set out in Procedural Order No. 3 to submit its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and
Memorial on Jurisdiction. On 1 October 2018, in response to an invitation to provide
comments from the Tribunal, the Claimant submitted its observations regarding the

Respondent’s extension request.

On 10 October 2018, following additional exchanges between the Parties, the Tribunal
issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning adjustments to the procedural calendar. In its
order, the Tribunal granted a 60-day extension to the Respondent to file its
Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction and allowed a 60-day
extension to the Claimant for the filing of its Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on

Jurisdiction, if so required.

By communications of 26 and 29 October 2018, and 27 and 29 November 2018, the Parties
consulted with the Tribunal concerning potential alternative hearing dates, in case the
Claimant were to apply for a 60-day extension under Procedural Order No. 4 and the
end-January 2020 hearing needed to be moved. Having consulted with the Parties, the
Tribunal concluded that it was necessary to keep the January 2020 hearing dates to avoid

several additional months of delay in the proceeding.

By communications of 18 and 20 December 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their
agreement to propose amendments to the procedural calendar with respect to the timetable

for the remaining procedural steps prior to the hearing.

On 19 December 2018, the Petitioners filed an application for leave to intervene as
non-disputing parties pursuant to Annex 831 of the FTA and Rule 37(2) of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules, which included a request to file a written submission, to access

case documents and to attend the hearing (the “Petitioners’ Application”).

On 21 December 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, approving the Parties’

proposed amendments to the procedural calendar of 18 and 20 December 2018.

On 24 December 2018, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits
(“Respondent’s Counter-Memorial”) and Memorial on Jurisdiction (“Respondent’s

The Claimant’s observations were accompanied by legal authorities CL-129 to CL-138 and

the Respondent’s observations were accompanied by legal authorities RL-133 to RL-138.

On 18 February 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 concerning the

9/387

39,

40.

41.

42.

Petitioners’ request to file a non-disputing party submission, it denied the Petitioners’ request
to obtain access to case documents which were not publicly available, and it confirmed that
the Petitioners had the right to attend the oral hearing as it was open to the public pursuant
to Article 830(2) of the FTA and paragraph 21.8 of Procedural Order No. 1. The Tribunal
concluded the following at paragraph 35 of Procedural Order No. 6:

“[O]n the basis of the strikingly limited Application, the Tribunal does not
find that the Petitioners have met the requirements of Arbitration Rule 37(2)
and Annex 831 of the FTA, or even sought to meet those requirements. Those
provisions impose on a petitioner a duty to set out reasoned arguments, and
none are sufficiently present.”
On 22 March 2019, following exchanges between the Parties, each Party filed a request for

the Tribunal to decide on production of documents.

On 5 April 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, ruling on the Parties’

respective requests for document production.

On 1 June 2019, the Claimant filed a Reply on Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction

(“Ricaurte Opinion”), with supporting documents PMR-1 to PMR-46.

(“Second Rossi Report”), with supporting documents MR-49 to MR-78; (vi) Expert Report
of Mr. Christopher Johnson dated 9 October 2019 (“Johnson Report”), with supporting
documents CJ-1 to CJ-30; and (vii) Expert Report of Prof. Felipe de Vivero Arciniegas dated
9 October 2019 (“Vivero Arciniegas Report”), with supporting documents PFDV-1 to

On 8 November 2019, the Claimant filed an application requesting that the Tribunal (i) strike

Rule 31(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules or, alternatively, (ii) grant the Claimant the right

G. Post-HEARING PROCEEDINGS

60. On 28 January 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, providing guidance
regarding the Parties’ post-hearing briefs — to be filed by 28 February 2020 — and posing the

following six questions to the Parties:

“QUESTION 1 - The arbitral record incorporates references to decisions of
the Colombian courts or to Colombian law in connection with matters
apparently connected with disputed issues in this arbitration. What legal
relevance should the Tribunal attribute to such references given the fact that
the claims in this case have been made under international
treaties/international law?

QUESTION 2 - Article 2201 of the Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement
provides, inter alia, as follows:

‘3. For the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the requirement

that such measures are not applied in a manner that constitute arbitrary or
unjustifiable discrimination between investment or between investors, or a
disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing
measures necessary:

a. To protect protect human, animal or plant life or health, which the
Parties understand to include environmental measures necessary

to protect human, animal or plant life and health;

b. To ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not
inconsistent with this Agreement; or

c For the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural
resources.

17/387

4. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from
adopting or maintaining measures relating to nationals of the other Party
aimed at preserving public order, subject to the requirement that such
measures are not applied in a manner that constitutes arbitrary or
unjustifiable discrimination. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Parties
understand that the rights and obligations under this Agreement, in particular
the rights of investors under Chapter Eight (Investment), remain applicable
to such measures.’

What is the effect of the second sentence of the exception in Article 2201(4)
(as emphasised in italics), and its absence from the exception in
Article 2201(3), on the application of Chapter Eight (Investment) to the rights
of investors in relation to measures to which the Article 2201(3) exception is
applicable? It would be helpful if the assessment could take into account other
treaty practise of Canada and Colombia.

QUESTION 3 - What, if any, is the application and effect of the ‘margin of
appreciation enjoyed by national regulatory agencies when dealing with
public policy determinations’ (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Phillip Morris v.
Uruguay, Award, 8 July 2016 (Authority RL-102), § 388) to the delimitation
of the paramo?

QUESTION 4 - Both Colombian legal experts addressed Constitutional
Court Decision C-339/02 of 7 May 2002 (Exhibit C-82) in their testimony on
Day 4. In Decision C- 339/02, the Constitutional Court addresses a
constitutional challenge against articles 3 (partially), 4, 18 (partially), 34, 35
(a) and (c) (partially), and 36 (partially) of the Mining Code 2001. This
Decision, inter alia, provides as follows:

[.]

Article 34(1) prohibits mining exploitation and exploration works in such
areas that are delimited and declared, in accordance with the regulations in
force, as areas for the protection of renewable natural resources or the
environment, or that expressly exclude mining activities. Up to this point,
there are no objections to the provision, since it is in agreement with the
principles set out in the Constitution for environmental and natural resource
protection, which were discussed at the beginning of these recitals.

Article 34(2) indicates that excluded areas comprise the following: a) The
system of national natural parks; b) regional natural parks, and c) reserve
forest areas. The aim is to protect biodiversity, given the great importance
that Colombia has worldwide, as acknowledged by the Court in analyzing the
issue. The Court also explains that, besides the areas excluded in this Law,
there may be others, whether already declared or to be declared as such in
the future by the environmental authority.

18/387

Of course, excluded areas must be clearly geographically delimited by the
environmental authority, in compliance with Article 5 of Law 99 of 1993.
Provision is also made for cooperation by the mining authority in areas of
mining interest, which is in keeping with the principle of priority protection
of the country’s biodiversity, along with sustainable exploitation, in
accordance with universal and sustainable development principles included
in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development dated June 1992,
which was ratified by Colombia.

The Court considers it worth mentioning that the mining authority must
cooperate with the environmental authority, but this duty of cooperation does
not limit or condition the exercise of the powers of the environmental
authority, which is the one authorized to establish excluded areas. Thus, the
operative part will make the enforceability of Article 34(2) of Law No. 685 of
2001 subject to certain conditions.

[.]

When applying paragraph 3, one must follow the precautionary principle, a
principle which can be understood with the expression ‘in dubio pro
ambiente’. The same principle must be applied with respect to the fourth
paragraph of article 34, in accordance with the principle number 25 of the
Rio Declaration that states: ‘Peace, development and environmental
protection are interdependent and indivisible’.

Assuming that Colombia is observing the precautionary principle referred to
above — i.e., in dubio pro ambiente — so far as the delimitation of the
paramos is concerned, does that have any impact on the consideration of its
rights and obligations under international law?

Specifically, assuming that the fact that it has yet to delimit the paramo (see,
e.g., Exhibit C-455) is legitimate and grounded on Colombia’s duty not to
allow activities that pose a risk irreversibly to affect the environment and its
natural resources, does that prevent Colombia from incurring any possible
responsibility under international law in case it is established that the
investors’ rights have been violated?

QUESTION 5 - In discussing Constitutional Court Decision C-35 both
Colombian legal experts referred to the right of many parties affected by the
decision to seek compensation from the lower courts. What domestic legal
options were available to a diligent investor to obtain compensation after the
Constitutional Court’s Decision C-35?

QUESTION 6 - The parties are further invited to make any further
submissions they believe relevant, if and only to the extent they believe it
would be helpful to the Tribunal, arising out of the evidentiary hearing which
took place between 20 - 24 January 2020.”

On 11 February 2020, the Government of Canada (“Canada”) wrote a letter to the Tribunal
providing written notice to the disputing parties and to the Tribunal that Canada intended to
exercise its right to file a non-disputing submission on questions of interpretation of the

Treaty pursuant to Article 827(2) of the FTA.

On 12 February 2020, the Tribunal invited Canada to file its written submission by
4 March 2020 and noted that the disputing parties would then have 21 days upon receipt of

said submission to file observations on Canada’s submission.

On 13 February 2020, the Claimant sent a letter to the Tribunal requesting the Tribunal to
place certain conditions and parameters on Canada’s submission and the responsive

submissions of the Parties.

On 17 February 2020, the Parties were invited to provide a joint booklet containing all the
relevant legislation in Spanish and English and in chronological order so as to assist the

Tribunal in preparation for the Tribunal’s deliberations scheduled for 5 March 2020.!°

On 18 February 2020, the Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal conveying its endorsement
to Canada’s filing of a non-disputing party submission and deferring to the Tribunal as to
when and in which conditions the Tribunal wished to receive such submission and the

Parties’ comments thereto.
On 19 February 2020, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties and to Canada, inter alia, as follows:

“Having carefully reviewed and considered the parties’ observations, the
Tribunal concludes that it would be assisted by receiving a written submission
from Canada that does not exceed 8 pages and is limited to the questions
raised in the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 11 of 28 January 2020.

As per the Tribunal’s request during the Hearing: Tr. Day 2 (Ms. Blanch) 403:9 er seq and Tr. Day 5
(Ms. Blanch), 1584:14 er seq.

73.

In view of considerable time constraints related to the Tribunal’s
deliberations scheduled for 5 March 2020 in the present proceeding, the
Tribunal is obliged to request that the written submission from Canada be
received not later than Thursday, 27 February 2020. The parties will be
allowed to submit a brief reply submission by Tuesday, 3 March 2020 which
shall not exceed 4 pages. The Tribunal apologises for the short time afforded
to you in this regard, which is necessary to allow it to meet the demands of
the schedule in this arbitration.

The Tribunal notes that the deliberations it will hold on 5 March will be
preliminary in nature. The Tribunal may raise further questions for the
parties arising out of such initial deliberations.”

On 27 February 2020, the Claimant requested a 48-hour extension to the deadline for filing

the post-hearing briefs. On the same date, the Respondent opposed the extension request.

On 27 February 2020, the Tribunal granted the Claimant’s extension request and noted that
the Parties could file their respective post-hearing briefs by 1 March 2020.

On 27 February 2020, Canada filed its non-disputing party submission (“Canada’s Non-
Disputing Party Submission”).

On or about 28 February 2020, the Parties provided a Joint Booklet of Relevant Legal

Instruments to the Tribunal in hard copy.

On | March 2020, the Parties filed their respective post-hearing briefs. The Claimant’s
submission was accompanied by an Annex containing corrections to the Hearing transcript
(“Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief”). In footnote 212 of the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief,
reference was made to a new, unnumbered, legal authority (i.e., Constitutional Court,
Judgment T-299, 3 April 2008). The Respondent’s submission was accompanied by a
Consolidated List of Exhibits (on account of the reference made in the said submission to

twelve new legal authorities — RL-176 to RL-187) (“Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief’).

On 3 March 2020, the Parties filed their respective comments on Canada’s Non-Disputing

Party Submission.

On 5 March 2020, the Tribunal held a deliberations session in London, United Kingdom.
Further sessions were held via Zoom on 8 February 2021 and 25 March 2021.

(2) Republic of Colombia

With more than 54,000 species registered in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
(GBIF), Colombia shares first place with Brazil in terms of biodiversity in the world and is
identified by the United Nations Environment Programme as one of the 17 megadiverse
countries that are home to 70% of the biodiversity in the world on only 10% of its territory.
Colombia ranks number one in terms of biodiversity in birds and orchids, second in plants,
amphibians, freshwater fish and butterflies, third in reptiles and palm trees and fourth in

mammal diversity.*?

Colombia’s Political Constitution of 1991 (“Political Constitution”)® is designated as the
Green Constitution*4 as a consequence of the fact that environmental protection is at
the heart of Colombian society and law. As far back as 1992, in its Judgment T-411/92, the

Constitutional Court of Colombia,** stated that:

“Ecology contains an essential core, it being understood by this that part that
is absolutely necessary so that legally protected interests and what gives rise
to it turn out to be real and effectively act as a guardian. The essential content
is overtaken or not recognized when the right is submitted to the limitations
that make it unfeasible, making it more difficult beyond what is reasonable or
divesting it of the necessary protection. The rights to work, private property,
and freedom of business enjoy special protection, provided that there exists a
strict respect of the ecological function, this is the duty to safeguard the
environment due to a fundamental constitutional right.”

According to Colombia, it has “a particularly significant moral responsibility to conserve

and preserve its environment for the benefit of the planet and mankind.”*® Articles 8, 58, 79

for liquid, industrial and domestic waste, program for industr ial and domestic solid waste, program for the
protection of flora and recovery of (forest eco systems, P , and the Mc

Program for particulate matter and gases.”

B. PARAMO ECOSYSTEMS

86.

Paramos are high-mountain ecosystems that play a central role in maintaining biodiversity,
premised on a unique capacity to absorb and restore water. In South America, paramo
ecosystems form the so-called ‘pearl necklace’ along the Andean Mountains. In Colombia,
37 paramo complexes have been identified, representing about 50 percent of the world’s
paramo ecosystems. Paramos have highly endemic flora and fauna. The Santurban Paramo
provides water to around 2.5 million people in 68 surrounding municipalities.*° Indeed,

Colombia views the paramo ecosystems as “environmental jewels”.*!

C. RELEVANT GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES

87.

88.

(1) Environmental Authorities”

On 22 December 1993, the Congress of Colombia enacted Law No. 99 of 1993 (“General
Environmental Law”), inter alia, formulating the principles that govern Colombian
environmental policy, creating the Ministry of Environment (“MinAmbiente”) and
reorganizing the Public Sector in charge of the management and conservation of the

environment and the renewable natural resources.*?

Articles 1(2) and (4) of the General Environmental Law formulate the general environmental
principles that: (i) the country’s biodiversity, as it is a national heritage site and of interest
to humanity, must be protected first and foremost and maximized sustainably; and
(ii) paramos, low paramos, water springs, and aquifer recharging zones must be especially

protected.

Tr. Day 1 (Mr. Mantilla-Serrano), 253:8-10.

Tr. Day 1 (Mantilla-Serrano), 249:5 et seq. (in particular, 267:14-21 — “Colombia were becoming more and
more aware of the importance of protecting these kind of jewels, environmental jewels that we have been
entrusted with in taking care of in Colombia. And that took place in the early '90s, and I have been walking
you through the different measw international measures and domestic measures that were taken by
Colombia in order to fulfill thi ion”; 268:10-12 —“the protection and the actual ban on mining is-if we're
talking about centuries, it’s quite recent”) For a timeline of the legal instruments for the protection of the
paramos, see IAVH, Biodiversidad 2015, Historic legal instruments for the protection of paramo ecosystems

Pursuant to Article 2 of the General Environmental Law, MinAmbiente is “the lead agency

for the management of environment and renewable natural resources, and shall be in charge

of promoting a relationship of respect and harmony between man and nature and of defining,
pursuant to this Law, the policies and regulations to which the recovery, conservation,
protection, regulation, handling, use and exploitation of the Nation’s renewable natural
resources and environment shall be subject, in order to guarantee sustainable development.”
Article 2 further determines that MinAmbiente, “jointly with the President of the Republic
and ensuring the participation of the community, shall develop the national policy on
environment and renewable natural resources, so that the right of all the persons to enjoy a
healthy environment is guaranteed and the Nation’s natural heritage and sovereignty is

protected.”

Article 23 of the General Environmental Law created the Regional Autonomous
Corporations, public corporate entities charged with “administering, within the area under
their jurisdiction, the environment and renewable natural resources, and promoting
sustainable development in compliance with the legal provisions and the policies of the
Ministry of Environment.” In the area of the Project, the two competent Regional
Autonomous Corporations are the Regional Autonomous Corporation of the North-East
Border (“CORPONOR’) and the Regional Autonomous Corporation for the Defence of the
Bucaramanga Plateau (“CDMB”).

Article 19 of the General Environmental Law further created the Alexander Von Humboldt
Institute (“IAVH”), a civil non-profit corporation, of a public nature but subject to the rules
of private law, “charged with conducting basic and applied research on the genetic
resources of the national flora and fauna and with drawing up and preparing the scientific

biodiversity inventory in all the national territory” and “in charge of the applied scientific

investigation in relation to the biol 1 and hydrobiol / resources in the l

territory of the Country.”

MinAmbiente was restructured in 2011, its designation — Ministry of Environment, Housing
and Territorial Development (MADVT) — being substituted by Ministry of Environment and
Sustainable Development (MADS).**

On 27 September 2011, the National Environmental Licensing Agency (““ANLA”) was
created so as “to take care of the study, approval and issuance of environmental licences,
permits and processes that will contribute to improve the efficiency, efficacy and

and inable de 45 This Special

Administrative Unit substituted the Directorate of Environmental Licenses and Permits,

which acted on behalf of the MinAmbiente between 1993 and 2011.

(2) Mining Authorities

According to Article 317 of the Mining Code 2001, the Ministry of Mines and Energy
(“MinMinas”) is the default mining authority.*° The objective of MinMinas is to formulate,
adopt, direct and coordinate the policies, plans and programs of the Sector of Mines

and Energy.*”
MinMinas delegated certain administrative functions to the following entities:

a. National Mining Company - MINERCOL Ltda. (“MINERCOL”): between 2001
and 2004;4%

b. Colombian Geology and Mining Institute - INGEOMINAS (“INGEOMINAS”):

ECO ORO’S INVESTMENT IN THE ANGOSTURA PROJECT AND THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY
COLOMBIA

(1) Open-Pit Mining Project

At the recommendation of a former director of Eco Oro,*! in the early 1990s, Eco Oro
decided to invest in a gold-silver deposit located in Angostura, within the California-Vetas
Mining District, a region of longstanding mining tradition.*? This deposit, together with the
La Bodega and La Mascota gold-silver deposits, is distributed over a ~4 km interval of an
11 km long, NE trending high to intermediate sulphidation epithermal system that forms the
core of the California-Vetas gold district. The deposits occur in that order, from NE to SW,
and are located in the western branch of the Eastern Andean Cordillera of northeastern
Colombia near the border with Venezuela, some 400 km NNE of the Country’s capital,
Bogota, and ~67 km NE of the city of Bucaramanga, the capital of the Department of
Santander. The deposit is situated at elevations of from 2,400 to 3,500 metres above sea level

(“masl”).*

Exhibit MR-11

Gold is reported to have been discovered in the California-Vetas district as early as 1549
during a Spanish military action, although it had already been the site of much earlier
artisanal activity by the indigenous Sura people. Spanish colonials exploited two open-pit
operations in the district at San Antonio in the La Baja portion and at La Perezosa,
immediately SW of La Mascota and NE of Angostura respectively. Production continued
on a small scale through the next two and a half centuries. In the early 19th and 20th
centuries the British company Colombian Mining Association and French company Francia
Gold and Silver undertook operations that included a mill and smelter just outside the town
of California. In 1947, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company took an option on a property
at La Baja that encompassed the present La Bodega deposit and conducted exploration via
tunneling and 746 m of drilling. Core recoveries were reportedly so poor that insufficient

information was available to justify a large option payment and Anaconda withdrew. Nippon

Mining Company undertook drilling in the La Baja area in 1967, whilst exploration was
undertaken by Placer Development and INGEOMINAS in the 1970s and 1980s

respectively.**

On 28 October 1994, Eco Oro entered into an assignment agreement with Mr. Crisanto Pefia
and with Minas Los Diamantes of Permit 3452.*° Permit 3452 had originally been granted
in 1988 to Mr. Crisanto Pefia and to Mr. José Alfredo Rangel and entitled its holders to
explore and exploit precious metals in a 250-hectare area within the Angostura gold
deposit.*° Permit 3452 was governed by Decree 2477 of 1986°” and expressly provided that
the area encompassed by Permit 3452 did not fall within the scope of Article 20 of said

Decree, which provides as follows:

“Exploration and exploitation activities shall not be performed in the manner
provided in the above articles: [...]

e) In other areas where the performance of mining activities is prohibited by
the Code on Renewable Natural Resources and Environmental Protection
and other applicable provisions.”

In 1995, Eco Oro started carrying out a program of surface mapping, sampling and diamond

drilling.** Between 1995 and 2001, Eco Oro acquired additional rights over the Angostura

After obtaining CDMB’s approval of the relevant Environmental Management Plan
(“PMA”) for the exploratory stage of the mining project for Permit 3452 (in June 1997”),
Eco Oro announced its first resource estimates, in the region of several million ounces, in
September 1997. One year later, Eco Oro published a news release stating that the previous
resource estimate had been doubled in volume and which contemplated an open pit mine or
an underground mine.“ This estimate was again updated in November 2005 declaring
indicated and inferred resources of 10.3 million ounces of indicated and inferred resources
of gold® and by mid-2006 the declared resources were increased by a further million ounces
of gold. By January 2009 gold resources of over 15 million ounces were declared® and
by August 2010 Eco Oro estimated over 11 million ounces of measured, indicated and

inferred gold.

“a more modern legislation, which gives legal stability to investors, in accordance with
international standards.”®® The 2001 Mining Code provided for three phases: exploration,
construction and exploitation in one unified concession contract. It further provided, inter

alia, as follows:

“ARTICLE I. PURPOSES. The public interest purpose of this Code is to
promote the technical exploration and exploitation of privately-held and
state-owned mining resources; to foster such activities in order to meet the
needs of domestic and foreign demand for such resources, and to ensure that
these resources are exploited in accordance with the principles and
regulations governing the rational exploitation of non-renewable natural
resources and the environment, focusing on sustainable development and the
country’s social and economic progress as a comprehensive notion.

ARTICLE 15. NATURE OF THE BENEFICIARY’S RIGHT. The concession
contract and other titles issued by the Government referred to in the
preceding Article shall not grant the beneficiary any property right on the
minerals ‘on site,’ but the right to exclusively and temporarily determine the
existence of minerals in exploitable quantities and qualities within the
covered area, and to take such minerals through extraction or abstraction,
and the right to subject third party plots of lands to the easements required
for the efficient performance of such activities.

ARTICLE 34. AREAS THAT MAY BE EXCLUDED FROM MINING. Mining
exploration and exploitation works and projects may not be carried out in
areas declared and delimited in accordance with the legal framework
currently in force for the protection and development of renewable natural
resources or the environment and which, in accordance with the relevant
legal provisions, expressly exclude said works and __ projects.
The aforementioned exclusion zones will be those constituted in accordance
with the legal provisions in force, such as areas that comprise the system of
national natural parks, regional natural parks and forest reserve areas.
To that end, these areas should be geographically delimited by the
environmental authority on the basis of technical, social and environmental
studies with the collaboration of the mining authority, in those areas of
mining interest.

In order for mining exploration and exploitation works and projects to be
excluded or restricted in areas for the protection and development of
renewable natural resources or the environment, the act by which these are
declared must be expressly based on studies that establish the incompatibility
of or need to restrict mining activities. However, by means of a well-founded
administrative act of the environmental authority that orders the subtraction
of the required area, the mining authority may authorize that in the areas
referred to in this article, with the exception of parks, mining activities may
be carried out in a restricted manner or only by means of specified extraction
methods and systems that do not affect the objectives of the exclusion zone.
To that end, the interested party in the Concession Contract must present
studies that demonstrate the compatibility of mining activities with such
objectives.

[.]
ARTICLE 36, EFFECTS OF THE EXCLUSION OR RESTRICTION.

In concession contracts, the areas, plots of land and courses where, pursuant
to the above articles, mining activities are prohibited shall be deemed
excluded or restricted by operation of law or conditioned by the granting of
special permits or authorizations.

This exclusion or restriction need not be declared by any authority
whatsoever, or be expressly stated in acts and agreements, nor may be subject
to any waiver by the bidder or concessionaire of such areas or plots of land.
If such areas or plots of lands were actually the site of a concessionaire’s
works, the mining authority shall order they be immediately removed and
cleared, without awarding any payment, compensation or damages
whatsoever for this reason, notwithstanding the proceedings the competent
authorities may commence in each case where applicable.

[.]

38/387

ARTICLE 45. DEFINITION.

The mining concession contract is the agreement entered into between the
State and an individual to carry out, at the individual’s expense and risk,
exploration works for state-owned minerals that may be found within a
delimited area, and to exploit them under the terms and conditions
established in this Code. This agreement differs from public works contracts
and public services concession contracts. The phases comprised by the
concession contract within its purposes are technical exploration, economic

Xp ion, mineral beneficiation at the ire’s expense and risk
and closure | or ceasing of the relevant works and construction.

 

 

ARTICLE 46. APPLICABLE LAW.

The mining laws in force at the time that the concession contract is perfected
will be applicable throughout the term of its execution and extensions. If said
laws are modified or added to at a later date, these laws will apply to the
concessionaire only insofar as they broaden, confirm or improve its rights
with the exception of those regulations that contemplate the modification of
the anticipated economic revenues to the State or Territorial Entities.

[J

ARTICLE 197. CONSTITUTION AND EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT.
The conclusion of a concession contract and its registration in the National
Mining Registry are regulated by the provisions of this Code.

For_the ion _of this contract, before the and
performance of the exploitation work, all envi | requirements and
conditions set forth in this Chapter, and for those not foreseen therein, those
set forth _in_the general envi ! regulations, should _be_met.”

[Tribunal’s emphasis]

 

103. The 2001 Mining Code also contained a provision allowing for the integration of areas

founded in different mining titles, pursuant to which Eco Oro applied for the integration of
the areas encompassed by its different titles.” As Eco Oro’s titles were governed by
different statutes, Eco Oro requested that the provisions of the 2001 Mining Code be applied

the integration of the areas of ten of the mining titles held by Eco Oro within the Angostura

deposit.” In its Resolution, INGEOMINAS further established the following:

“As to the duration of the contract to be signed and the plate it will have, it is
observed that the oldest title is permit No. 3452, registered in the National
Mining Register on August 14, 1990; consequently, it will be this title that
will determine the plate and the duration of the contract to be signed, which
has an execution period of 16 years, therefore said term must be discounted
from the title to be granted, which will have a remaining total duration of
14 years counted from the registration of the contract to be signed, and will
have an exploration stage of 3 years, 2 years of construction and assembly,
and the remainder will be the exploitation period, the above in response to
the approved single exploration and exploitation program.

The term of the contract for the consolidated areas was calculated in
accordance with Article 103 of [the 2001 Mining Code].” [Tribunal’s
emphasis]

104. On 8 February 2007, Eco Oro and INGEOMINAS entered into a Concession Contract for

the Exploration and Exploitation of a Deposit of Gold, Silver, Chromium, Zinc, Copper, Tin,
Lead, Manganese, Precious Metals and Associated Minerals No. 3452 with INGEOMINAS
(“Concession 3452”).”> Concession 3452 was registered with the Mining Registry on

9 August 2007.

(Exhibit C-443), whereby Greystar requested, inter alia, that the provisions of the 2001 Mining Code be
applied to all its titles. See also INGEOMINAS Resolution DSM No. 75 (2 February 2007) (Exhibits C- 109

In May 2007, the IAVH published the 2007 IAVH Paramo Atlas (the “2007 Atlas”),”> which
was prepared on a scale of 1:250,000. The IAvH established a lower limit for the bioclimatic
zone of the sub-paramo being 3200 mas! which resulted in a 54% overlap of the Santurban

Paramo and the area of Concession 3452.

On 16 April 2008, Eco Oro filed an amended PMA with CDMB further to the integration of
the areas of its mining titles.”° Whilst there is no reference in the file as to whether this PMA
was approved, there are subsequent acts by CDMB determining that Eco Oro’s activities
were generally compliant with environmental requirements and approving the
Environmental Audit Reports submitted by Eco Oro on the basis of an approved PMA” on

the basis of which, Eco Oro contends, it understood its amended PMA had been approved. ”®

On 20 March 2009, Eco Oro announced that the IFC had completed an investment in the
company.” The investment was preceded by an Environmental & Social Review by the

IFC, which, on the basis of baseline studies undertaken by Ingetec, highlighted the fact that

the area of influence of the Project enshrined a “habitat of key importance”, “the paramo, an

area of significant biological relevance defined by Colombian legislation.”*°

On 23 September 2009, Eco Oro submitted its Construction and Works Plan (Plan de
Trabajo y Obras) (“PTO”) to INGEOMINAS.*! The filing of a PTO is required by
Article 84 of the 2001 Mining Code prior to the expiry of the exploration phase and is
presented for the approval of the competent environmental authority. Exploitation cannot
be commenced without, inter alia, such approval. Section 1.9.2 of the 2009 PTO was titled
“Main environmental and social problems” and states “[t]he proximity of project Angostura
to the Santurban Paramo is something to be taken into account, because the lakes are
situated in the area [...].” The plans which were to be submitted with the PTO were

delivered on 10 February 2010.

On 22 December 2009, Eco Oro applied for a Global Environmental License to
MinAmbiente. Among other materials provided, Eco Oro submitted an Environmental
Impact Study (“EIA”) prepared by Union Temporal Vector and Ingetec pursuant to the
Terms of Reference provided by MinAmbiente.*? This EIA identified a significant presence
of paramo and subpaéramo ecosystems in the Concession area. On 13 January 2010,
MinAmbiente ordered the commencement of an administrative procedure for the grant of a

Global Environmental License.*?

On 9 February 2010, Law 1382 of 2010 was enacted.** Pursuant to Article 3 of this Law,
Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code was amended to include an express reference to “paramo
ecosystems” amongst the areas in which mining operations could be prohibited, reading, in

relevant part, as follows:

“Mining exploration and exploitation works and projects may not be carried
out in areas declared and delimited in accordance with the legal framework
currently in force for the protection and development of renewable natural
resources or the environment.

The aforementioned exclusion zones will be those that have been constituted
or will be established in accordance with the legal provisions in force, such
as areas that comprise the system of national natural parks, regional natural
parks, protected forest reserve areas and other forest reserve areas, paramo
ecosystems, and the wetlands indicated in the list of international importance
of the Ramsar Convention. To that end, these areas should be geographically
delimited by the environmental authority on the basis of technical, social and
environmental studies. The paramo ecosystems shall be identified in
accordance with the cartographic information provided by the Alexander Von
Humboldt Investigation Institute.”

111. Article 3, paragraph 1, further contained a grandfathering provision providing that:

“If on the effective date of this law, any construction and assembly or
exploitation activities are being undertaken subject to a mining title and an
environmental license or their equivalent in areas which were not previously
excluded, such activities shall be allowed until their expiration, but no
extensions shall be granted with regard to such titles.”

112. Article 3, paragraph 3, in turn specified that:

“The declaration of the exclusion areas referred to in this section requires the
Ministry of Mining and Energy’s prior non-binding opinion.”

113. On20 April 2010, MinAmbiente ordered that the EIA be returned to Eco Oro, on the grounds

that the project was located in a paramo zone as delineated according to the 2007 Atlas.*°
The Order issued by MinAmbiente further made reference to the amendment of Article 34
of the 2001 Mining Code introduced by Article 3 of Law 1382 of 9 February 2010, noting
that “in order to define the [mining] exclusion area [...] reference must be made to the
definition of the [[AvH], as established by said law.” The Order issued by the MinAmbiente
requested Eco Oro to present a new study taking into account the so-called “Paramo of

Santurban” ecosystem as an area excluded from mining activities.

This decision generated significant concern both within Eco Oro and in the market at large.
Eco Oro was concerned that almost all its activities were above 3200 masl thus coming
within the boundaries of the 2007 Atlas, including half of the open pit area, and this decision
effectively stopped the project, causing it to be potentially unfeasible or uneconomic.*°
Eco Oro published a news release on 26 April 2010,°7 which was echoed in several

specialised news outlets.** Eco Oro’s market value collapsed that day.*”

On 29 April 2010, Eco Oro filed a request for reconsideration of the 20 April 2010 order
issued by MinAmbiente, on the basis that Eco Oro’s application had been submitted under
the prior iteration of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code and, therefore, should be considered
under such provisions and not the amended provisions introduced by Law 1382.°” Eco Oro
also referred to the consolidation of its mining titles and to the fact that it had adhered to the
provisions of the 2001 Mining Code, which contained Article 46 which Eco Oro invoked to
argue that Law 1382 should not apply retroactively to the Concession. Eco Oro further
argued that, even if Law 1382 were applicable, the requirements set out in Article 34 of the
2001 Mining Code as amended by said law had not been complied with. Eco Oro noted that

the IAvH was not an environmental authority and therefore had no jurisdiction to declare a

mining exclusion zone. Eco Oro was concerned about the impact of MinAmbiente’s
decision and, in a report to the Board of Directors, the CEO noted that a “comprehensive
communication plan [had] to be developed to inform and shape Government and public
opinion that mining can be conducted responsibly alongside preservation of paramo and
water resources.”?' Tt was also noted that CDMB was “getting more vocal on preservation
of paramo” and that the publicity given to Eco Oro’s permit issue was attracting the attention
of NGOs who supported protection of the paramo and water resources from the activities

of miners.

On 19 May 2010, Eco Oro reported internally that it had had a “very good meeting with

Martinez the Mines Minister’ who had said the “Governments [sic] definitely wants the

project to go ahead.”

On 27 May 2010, MinAmbiente overturned its previous order and directed that the

assessment of Eco Oro’s EIA be resumed on its merits.”

As a part of the procedure required to be followed with respect to mining applications,
MinAmbiente held public hearings in California and in Bucaramanga. The meeting in
California, in November 2010, registered support for Eco Oro’s mining project, while the

one held in Bucaramanga in March 2011 was suspended due to violent confrontations.*°

Several demonstrations took place in different parts of the country, some of them in support

of the mining project and some others in support of paramo protection and water quality.*°

On 4 October 2010, pursuant to Order GTRB-0485,°” the Bucaramanga Regional Working
Group of INGEOMINAS asked Eco Oro to complete its PTO with respect to “the definition
of dumps, drilling and blasting, reservoirs, exploitation fronts, leaching piles and geology
as well as plans, schedules, etc.” Eco Oro was notified of this request two months after the
date of the order and given two months to obtain the requested documentation.
Documentation was provided on 24 January 2011, 18 February 2011 and 22 February 2011
and, on 14 March 2011, Eco Oro provided hydrogeological and stability studies.

On 15 December 2010, INGEOMINAS approved Eco Oro’s application for the first two-
year extension of the exploration stage under Concession 3452.°° Unlike subsequent
extension decisions, INGEOMINAS did not refer in this extension approval to there being

any limitation on Eco Oro’s activities within the area of the Concession.

On 20 January 2011, INGEOMINAS notified Eco Oro of its Technical Opinion on the
hydrogeological chapter of Eco Oro’s PTO,” which contained serious reservations about the
hydrogeological model presented by Eco Oro and recommended that Eco Oro carry out a
“more exhaustive work [...] in the hydrogeological research that would lead to minimizing

the uncertainties shown in the model.”

122. On 22 February 2011, INGEOMINAS designated Concession 3425 and the Project a Project
of National Interest (“PIN”).!°° Among the reasons for that decision, INGEOMINAS set

out the following:

“This project has a social and economic impact in the regions where the
operations are located and in the country, which translates into benefits such
as the creation of new jobs, royalties and investment in works that will benefit
the region.

As the project involves polymetallic sulphides, the techniques required for the
exploration, exploitation and extractive metallurgy involve the use of
chemical methods to treat the mineral ore that have an environmental impact,
which is a very sensitive subject for the communities that are directly affected
and, therefore, stricter verification and compliance with the technical, legal
and economic obligations is required in order to maximize the use of the
reserves with the least possible environmental impact.

In accordance with the bioclimatic characterization, the project’s
geographical location requires special attention from the Colombian
Government, as public opinion has shown great interest in the effects it might
have on the ecosystems and the communities that would be affected by the
exploration works.

Pursuant to the criteria established in Resolution No. 955 dated
November 21, 2007, INGEOMINAS considers this to be a project of national
interest as it meets the following requirements:

J. Large size with a high level of production.

2. High operating, technological and financial capacity.

3. Production is primarily intended for international markets.

4. It generates important economic resources for the country and the regions
where the operations are located.”

(2) Underground-mining Project

On 23 March 2011, after certain groups from outside the California and Vetas area voiced
their opposition to the open pit project based on its perceived environmental impact and after

internal discussions and the consideration of alternative solutions, '°! Eco Oro requested that

102

it be permitted to withdraw its Environmental License application.'°* Eco Oro made clear

that it was not fully withdrawing from the Project and clarified that the intent was “simply to
desist from on-going environmental licensing to allow for a future re-filing in the terms that
reflect concerns.” As an alternative to the open pit project, on 18 March 2011 reference
was first made to an underground-mine, in a news release addressing the purported
celebration by IAVH of Eco Oro’s withdrawal from the Project.!°* However, on 31 May

2011, MinAmbiente decided not to accept Eco Oro’s withdrawal request but to continue sua

5

sponte with the administrative procedure.'°> It proceeded to refuse to grant the global

environmental licence requested by Eco Oro. (This decision was confirmed by ANLA on

31 October 2011.!°°)

On 11 May 2011, the Colombian Constitutional Court rendered Judgment No. C-366,
whereby Law 1382 of 2010 was declared unconstitutional on the basis of lack of prior
consultation.!°’ However, the effects of this declaration of unconstitutionality were deferred

for a term of two years.

following Eco Oro’s request to withdraw it.!°°

126. On 25 May 2011, MinAmbiente issued Resolution No. 937.!° Article 1 provided that its
purpose was “[t]o adopt the cartography mapped at 1:250,000 scale provided by the [[AvH]
set forth in the so-called Atlas of Colombian Paramos [i.e., the 2007 Atlas!!°] for the
identification and delimitation of Paramo Ecosystems.” Article 1 further provided in

relevant part as follows:

“Paragraph 1. In the event that the environmental authorities have
conducted, within their areas of jurisdiction on the current status of the
paramos and approved the respective environmental management plans, the
identification and cartographic delimitation of the paramo ecosystem will be
the one set forth in said studies and plans prepared; and therefore, it will be
the one applicable for all legal purposes, provided the cartographic scale
utilized for delimitation is equal to or more detailed than the 1:25,000 scale,
and the elevation that was defined as the lower altitudinal limit for the
ecosystem is not increased, nor is the extent of the total established area
decreased, according to the identification made at the cartography 1:250,000
scale provided by the Alexander von Humboldt Research Institute of
Biological Resources.

Paragraph 2. The paramo ecosystems that have been declared in a category
of protected area will maintain that condition. However, under no
circumstance may mining activities or any other that are incompatible with
these ecosystems may be authorized.

Paragraph 3. The cartography adopted through this resolution will be
available for consultation by the interested parties on the website of the
Ministry of Environment, Housing and Territorial Development.”

127. On 16 June 2011, Law 1450 of 2011 (the 2010-2014 National Development Plan) was

period of up to three (3) years from the date of completion of the demarcation.

Paragraph 1. No agricultural activities, exploration or exploitation of
hydrocarbons and minerals, nor construction of hydrocarbon refineries shall
be undertaken in the paramos ecosystems. For these purposes, the
cartography contained in the Atlas of Colombian Paramos by the Alexander
von Humboldt Investigati Insti will be idered as a mini

Paragraph 2. In wetland ecosystems, agricultural activities, high-impact
hydrocarbon and mineral exploration and exploitation activities may be
restricted partially or completely on the basis of technical, economic, social
and environmental studies adopted by the Ministry of the Environment,
Housing and Territorial Development or any other entity acting in its place.
Within ninety (90) calendar days of the enactment of this Law, the National
Government shall set the regulations regarding the applicable criteria and
procedures. Under no circumstances may these activities be conducted in
wetlands specified in the list of wetlands of international importance of
the RAMSAR Convention.” |!

(Exhibit C-330) (“Currently, the requirements for declaring pdramo ecosystems throughout the country, as
reflected in the law in force have not been satisfied. Although the transitional regime in [Law 1450] requires
that the cartography set out in the von Humboldt Institute’s Atlas to be used as a minimum reference, at no
point does it determine that such cartography established the areas excluded from mining. Finally, the position
of the control organs in relation to the protection of natural resources is clear to this Office. Thus, the
precautionary principle constitutes one of the fundamental tenets of Colombian environmental policy.
However, such principle cannot disregard acquired rights, in accordance with Article 58 of the Political

as follows:!'3

“Currently, the requirements for declaring paramo ecosystems throughout
the country, as reflected in the law in force have not been satisfied. Although
the transitional regi[m]e in [Law 1450] requires that the cartography set out
in the von Humboldt Institute’s Atlas to be used as a minimum reference, at

precautionary principle constitutes one of the fundamental tenets of
Colombian environmental policy. However, such principle cannot disregard
acquired rights, in accordance with Article 58 of the Political Constitution.”

129. Brigitte Baptiste, Head of the IAvH, commented on this provision and on the provisions of

the late Law 1382 of 2010!'* nearly two years later (on 27 June 2013), as follows:

“First, I would like to insist and clarify that the delimitation to which we are
permanently referring is an administrative act by the Ministry of
Environment, the environmental authority, through which a specific legal
regime for the high mountain territories is adopted. It is not the delimitation
of an ecosystem for academic reasons or for the exclusive purpose of
conservation; it is a very unexpected policy decision in the history of this
country which excludes economic activities in about 3 million hectares of
high mountain.

Such delimitation, as an administrative act, was ordered by law — a law that
was first established by the former mining code, which has been repealed.
The law was more recently established in the development plan law, so it
constitutes a fully effective mandate from Congress giving powers and
instructions to the Ministry of Environment, the autonomous regional
corporations and the Humboldt Institute.”

. At around this time, Eco Oro carried out a corporate rebranding,

1:25,000 was underway pursuant to the provisions of Law No. 1450 and that the provisional

boundaries of the paramo had been set forth in the cartography of the 2007 Atlas.'!°

7 Which signalled a

significant change in corporate identity. According to Eco Oro’s President and CEO at the
time, “/t/he Greystar name has negative associations with Government in Colombia and in
Bucaramanga. Rebranding is necessary. This can be achieved through renaming the
Colombian company or through a corporate transaction. Clearly Government and public do
not trust a junior with no CV to develop a large and sensitive project.”''* In a letter to

MinMinas in 2013,'! Eco Oro summed up those changes as follows:

underground mine project (27 February 2012) (Exhibit C-24).

(16 August 2011) (Exhibit C-23).

Letter from Steve Kesler (Greystar) to the Greystar Board of Directors (14 March 2011) (Exhibit C-327). In
this letter, Mr. Kesler makes the following assertions with regard to the open-pit and underground options:
“7. A preliminary evaluation of an underground project indicates a smaller project but with robust economics
and at a capex that Greystar can manage. 8. EBX is developing a similar underground project at La Bodega.
[...] 10. Greystar does not want a NO decision to the current project as this is always difficult to reverse. An
agreement with Government to delay a decision and allow a joint study of options for leach pads would be a
better outcome. This was verbally agreed in Toronto . However, a change of location outside of the present
project area {eg to Surata) will mean significant delay in undertaking, new baseline studies, geotechnical
studies, project redesign and new EIA as well as engaging in land purchase. There would still be no guarantee
of an environmental license. Bucaramanga objections to a cyanide heap leach in a water course feeding the
city would remain. However, an option to develop the open pit in the future should ‘be maintained. 11. The
underground option requires a program of drilling to increase resources and to classify as reserves, more
detailed mine design studies, plant location and tailings dam studies. Discussions in Toronto with concentrate
traders indicated that a market does exist for pyrite concentrate and this needs to be developed as an
alternative. With the development of Cerro Matoso's heap leach project there will be a market for acid in
Colombia. This makes the option of off-site processing through roasting worth exploring. Minimization of
project footprint in challenging topography has value in public perception as well as reduced site pr eparation
costs.” See also Office of the C it Advisor O: (CAO), “C i IFC

“The changes that have taken place around the Angostura Project are
translated, among others, in that it is being led under a new philosophy and
a new strategic direction, nurtures itself from learning and knowledge of the
experiences and mistakes of the past. Equally behind this project are new
investors with a more human and environmental outlook; there is a new
Board of Directors with the participation of Colombians interested in
marking the development of this country and a new team mostly made up of
Santandereans.

You, Minister, must be aware of the abysmal differences between the old
Greystar open-cast project from a technical and environmental point of view,
and today’s Eco [Oro] underground project. But perhaps, we have not made
a big enough effort you [sic] pick up the feeling, the mood, the soul of those
who day by day fight. Our company takes it from there and shapes, with
realities, the dreams of thousands of families of the needy province of
Soto Norte.

Our identity is authentic and genuinely Colombian, and like you Dr. Amilkar,
we are proud of it: for no reason - not even for gold - would we be at the
forefront of a project that could undermine or jeopardise our land and
our people.”

decision, ANM highlighted that the extension was granted exclusively for the area that did
not overlap with the PZ Jurisdiccion-Santurban Paramo zone. ANM further ordered that,
once the decision became final, the areas overlapping with the paramo be handed over
pursuant to Article 82 of the 2001 Mining Code. On 29 August 2012, Eco Oro requested
that Resolution VSC 2 be revoked in its entirety.!2> On 12 September 2012, ANM issued

Resolution VSC 4,'?° whereby it amended its previous Resolution, stating that:

“Based on the evidence of the validity of the applicability of Laws No. 1382
of 2010 and No. 1450 of 2011 to concession agreement No. 3452, how the
legal exclusion indicated therein is to be put into practice should be
considered, with the elements available to the mining authority and based on
the criteria of reasonableness, proportionality and responsibility.

[.]

Hence, and in response to the arguments put forward by the mining title
holder in its petition for reversal, it is necessary to examine the rationality
and proportionality of the decisi ined in Resolution No. VSC-002,
dated August 8, 2012, based on the undeniable fact that, at present, Article
202 of Law No. 1450 of 2011 has not been developed, so there is no map at
a more detailed scale to provide the mining authority with solid arguments
to delimit with absolute certainty the paramo that the resolution is intended
to protect.

 

As a result, the decision in Resolution No. VSC-002, dated August 8, 2012,
must be intended to protect both the collective right to the environment
represented by the preservation of the paramo and the right of the holder of
the mining title to preserve an area whose legal status is uncertain, because
it cannot be said with complete certainty, due to the absence of technical
parameters, that it is located within the paramo.

However, the precautionary and prudent action that must be taken by the
government agency concerning collective rights cannot go so far as to
threaten subjective rights. Hence, the instruments provided for by the legal
system have to be used to create conditions to suspend rights so that, when
an uncertain condition is satisfied, the right is either granted or forfeited.

54/387

Accordingly, and in response to the arguments put forward by the holder of
the mining title in its petition for reversal filed under No. 2012-261-026565-
2, it is clear that the delimitation of the paramo ecosystem based on the map
of the Alexander von Humboldt Research Institute is temporary until the
competent environmental authority creates the final delimitation at a scale
of 1:25,000 after carrying out the technical, economic, social and
environmental studies referred to in Article 202 of Law No. 1450 of 2011.
For this reason, the mining authority determination must be in line with said
condition. Therefore, the mining authority considers it appropriate to adjust
Article 1 of Resolution No. VSC-002 of 2012 and, therefore, will modify it to
extend the exploration stage of mining concession agreement No. 3452 of
2007, suspending exploration activities in the area overlapping with the
paramo, in accordance with the delimitation based on the map in the Paramo
Atlas of Colombia by the Alexander von Humboldt Institute, until the Ministry
of the Environment and Sustainable Development or the entity acting in its
capacity issues the final delimitation of the paramo area in accordance with
Article 202 of Law No. 1450 of 2011. This will serve to ensure the effective
enforcement of the prohibition on mining activities in pdramo areas
contained in Article 202 of Law No. 1450 of 2011.

[J

[Eco Oro] may not carry out exploratory activities in the paramo area
pursuant to Article 202 of Law No. 1450 of 2011, until the Ministry of the
Environment and Sustainable Development or the entity acting in its capacity
issues the final delimitation to a scale of 1:25,000.” [Tribunal’s emphasis]

“The scope of science’s role in determining and fulfilling society's
requirements will always be partial, first because that is the nature of
knowledge, and second because the scientific research sector in Colombia
and in the Environmental Sector is very weak. The law directs us to produce
the information necessary to delimit the paramo, but fails to provide us with
the minimum tools or instruments to do so. During the first twelve months of
that process, we really have to aggressively draw on the funding on which we
depend in order to commence that process, which includes building a series
of criteria and academic conferences that enable us to do our best.

[.]

The paramo demarcation process required by law is of national scale — this
is very important — and the Institute must provide the requisite knowledge so
that all the paramos of the country — thirty-four paramo complexes — may be
delimited over the years, in a way that their biodiversity and ecological
function is protected. For us, it is impossible, from a scientific point of view,
to attain the detailed zoning or micro-zoning referred to by Alfredo Molina
at the beginning of the session, since Colombia's poor information systems
and handling and processing of environmental information are terribly,
terribly underdeveloped. We strive to abide by the law starting from a
national vision and from a process of estimation at successive, more detailed,
scales, reach then more precise estimations, which will in any case always
contain a significant level of uncertainty for decision-making processes, and
which pave the way for the required processes of agreement.

Up to now, the Institute has made no delimitation proposal, no. Iam sure that
any member of society may decipher, with the existing data, the boundaries
and characteristics of the paramo. But from our point of view, we have an
ecological and ecosystemic model with a 1:100,000 scale which is still
extremely inaccurate. Based on the information available which will be
gathered in the upcoming days, we will surely have to debate which
delimitation is required by law, even with a 1:25,000 scale, which is probably
not enough for the need or urgency of decision-making in specific points such
as the Vetas and California municipalities.

Now then, we have a great willingness and the time necessary to produce,
let's say, the best state-of-the-art knowledge on the region’s biology and
ecosystem, and to discuss the rest of the information on social and economic
studies. We also want to understand, very well, the dependence of the
communities on the paramo’s ecosystems and their lifestyles. A few days ago,
we were in the countryside — specifically, in Vetas and Berlin — and we were
told to leave. I perfectly understand the tension that we are working with, and
it is absolutely not our intention to cause any conflict with the community at
all, much less for the sake of a healthy environment built by local communities
and minorities that depend on their daily activities to survive, but we also
have to comply with the law.”

On 30 July 2013, on the basis of the restriction contained in Resolution VSC 4, which
Eco Oro understood to be “presently indicative and temporary”,'** Eco Oro requested from
the ANM a suspension of activities “until the final delimitation of the Santurban ecosystem
on a 1:25,000 scale is disclosed.” °° This request was based on the provisions of Article 54
of the 2001 Mining Code stating “technical, logistic and legal reasons” and attaching a
document named “Technical Considerations on the Suspension of Activities under Mining
Concession Agreement 3452.” This suspension request was granted by Resolution
VSC 1024 on 5 December 2013 for the term of six months commencing on 1 July 2013.'°7
That suspension was extended for a further six months on 17 January 2014'°* and again on

During the suspension, Eco Oro reported situations of galafardeo (unauthorized mining
activities) occurring in the areas encompassed by the Concession Contract 3452.'*°
This situation resurfaced later in June 2016.'4' Illegal mining has been an issue that the

Colombian mining sector has been facing for decades. It was mentioned, for instance, in the

On 9 September 2013, the Attorney General sent a letter to MinAmbiente, MinMinas and
ANM.'*° In this letter, the Attorney General stressed that the Colombian economic model
defined in the Political Constitution contemplated two key concepts so far as mining is
concerned: (i) mining, as with any other activity that has an impact on the environment, must
be developed responsibly and subject to strict environmental standards that ensure
compliance with the Colombian Constitution, especially, Article 80; and (ii) mining is a
lawful activity defined by law as being of social interest and public utility; it is broadly
regulated by the Colombian legal system and contributes to Colombian growth and
development. In that context, the Attorney General requested the addressees of its letter,

inter alia, to:

“Avoid ideologization of the debate and make decisions based on
comprehensive supporting studies; [...] Regularly share any progress made
in the zoning and delimitation process for the sake of transparency; [...]
Recognize any consolidated situations and vested rights to prevent the filing
of legal claims against the Colombian state; [...] The National Mining
Agency is required to proceed with caution to refrain from rejecting
proposals or terminating agreements if there are conditions — such as the
decisions made by the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable
Development — that may threaten citizens and companies that, relying on the
principle of confianza legitima, have approached the State to propose or
develop mining concessions.”

On 11 October 2013, the Santander Mine Workers’ Union (SINTRAMISAN) sent a letter to

OUR LIVES, JUST DELIMIT THE SANTURBAN PARAMO.”

On 24 February 2014, the Mayors of Soto Norte and other Municipalities wrote a letter to

149

MinAmbiente, countersigned by hundreds of citizens, '*” stating, inter alia, the following:

“Since the declaration of the Santurban Paramo Regional Natural Park
(PNR), more than 1,300 direct jobs and approximately 2,500 indirect jobs
have been lost in the areas of Vetas, California, Surata Matanza, Charta and
Tona. This reduction in employment in the area has resulted in a complicated
situation for civil unrest and illegality that will likely be aggravated if the
delimitation of the Paramo ecosystem covers an area larger than the Park.
This is because the communities of the Soto Norte region are not prepared to
allow their rights to be further affected; It is our duty to show that the Ministry
of Environment's decision on the delimitation of the Santurban paramo
ecosystem should not ignore the acquired rights of mining titleholders of the
Soto-Norte Region. This results in a sensitive situation from a juridical and
political perspective because in the municipalities that make up the region,
there are innumerable deposits of gold and silver, over which there are many
mining titles that were acquired from the Constitution and the Law (some of
which were granted under the terms of Law 2655 of 1988 and others under
Law 685 of 2001), and registered in the National Mining Registry; [...] If the
real objective is to preserve the area adequately, to prevent the proliferation
of illegal mining and to avoid environmental disasters, displacement and
misery, as well as a rise in unemployment and legal uncertainty, the area of
the paramo should not be larger than the area of the park.”

145. On 29 March 2014, Minister of Environment Luz Helena Sarmiento (“Minister

Sarmiento”) gave an interview to a newspaper!”° during which she said:

“Tomorrow, in Santurban, we will show the final boundaries of the paramo.
This is the solution to the typical conflict between the environment and
development, which is a matter of debate in the country and throughout the
world. Tomorrow we will put an end to the uncertainty,’ she said.

[..]
What happens in Greystar’s case?

Greystar, which is now Eco Oro, has no environmental license for
exploitation.

So it cannot carry out activities within the paramo?

They need to work outside the established boundaries. But the fact that they
are outside does not mean that they have secured the license. It means that
they have the right to file the request to obtain the environmental license for
exploitation. Outside the boundary, they can carry on with their exploration,
which does not require a license.

[..]
In short, will the foreign companies have to leave the Santurbén Paramo?

Yes. There are two Canadian giants: the previously called Greystar, which
now goes by Eco Oro, and Leyhat. And a Brazilian one, AUX, which was
exploring way below the paramo and seems to be having administrative
problems unrelated to the delimitation. They are trying to sell and they fired
a majority of their employees. The two Canadians must, I believe, analyze
whether operating outside the established boundary is profitable.

Why?

Because they cannot carry out mining activities in the titles that they have in
the paramo.

They did not have a license?

 

No. And as I tell my children, ‘Sorry, life is hard’

The coordinates of the paramo ecosystem were not, however, published the following day
(or indeed for eight months thereafter). On 1 April 2014, Eco Oro stated in a press release
that MinAmbiente had announced that the boundaries of the Santurban Paramo had been
delineated but no coordinates or cartography had been received by Eco Oro. Eco Oro further
noted that once it had received the cartography, it would assess the impact of the delineation

of the paramo on its assets. '*!

152

On 6 August 2014, ANM approved Eco Oro’s application'> for the third two-year extension

of the exploration stage under Concession Contract 3452.'*> In its decision, ANM reiterated
that Eco Oro “may not perform exploration activities within the paramo area, pursuant to
Article 202 of Law No. 1450 of 2011, until the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable
Development, or any other entity that may replace it, issues the final delimitation at a

1:25,000 scale.”

In August 2014, the newly appointed Minister of Environment'** visited Santander.!*>
During this visit, the Minister said that “The solution to this problem lies in where the
boundary will be located, but the most important, complementary aspect is how to clearly
guarantee that these people can continue to live in decent manner and, likewise, how to
guarantee adequate supply and quality of water to the entire Bucaramanga metropolitan
area [...].” To that effect, a manager, Luis Alberto Giraldo (“Mr. Giraldo”), was appointed
to lead the process aimed at coordinating the various stakeholders and become acquainted

first-hand with the reality of the municipalities. In performance of his duties, he visited

On 8 September 2014, a newspaper article recounted the history of the Santurban Péramo,

stating that there were records of Santurban as a paramo for more than four centuries. !>*

On 7 October 2014, MinAmbiente sent a letter to the Consejo de Estado!» asking the

following seven questions:

“1. Does the prohibition under Article 202(1) of Law No. 1450 apply
prospectively, i.e. would it affect only legal or factual situations that had not
already materialized prior to the entry into force of the prohibitions contained
in Law No. 1382 of 2010 and Law No. 1450 of 2011?

2. If the answer to the previous question is no, is the enforcing authority of
such law required to immediately order the closure of all prohibited
activities? Would such order result in potential liability for the State in
relation to persons with an interest in legal situations which have already
materialized in the area delimited as a pdramo ecosystem?

3. If the answer to the first question is no, is the government allowed to request
compliance with such law in a gradual or progressive manner, in furtherance
of the principle of legitimate expectations?

4. Can the environmental authority, through zoning and the regime governing
the uses of the delimited paramo ecosystem, adopt environmental actions to
progressively and gradually allow the reconversion of prohibited activities in
paramo ecosystems, even when such activities had materialized before the
entry into force of Law No. 1450 of 2011?

5. Is it possible to file an application for an envi | license with the
environmental authority in relation to mining titles that had been granted
before the entry into force of such prohibition and that did not apply for or
obtain the relevant environmental license authorizing the commencement
of mining exploitation activities? Is the environmental authority, while
Law No. 1450 of 2011 is in force, allowed to authorize mining exploitation
activities by granting an environmental license for mining titles that
were effective prior to the entry into force of the legal prohibition under
Law No. 1382 of 2010?

6. Pursuant to Article 202 of Law No. 1450, is the Ministry required to delimit
the ecosystem in line with the technical elements provided by natural
sciences, taking into account the social and economic information required
to characterize the area?

7. Or is it required to define the ecosystem by combining the elements
resulting from natural sciences and the social and economic aspects of the
area, which would involve excluding ecosystems already transformed by
human activities from the delimitation of the paramo?”

paramo ecosystems which cannot be neutralized through existing
environmental instruments cannot continue, and the general interest of

On 17 October 2014, a Colombian newspaper noted that in the “last few weeks [...]
[m]ultinational mining company AUX, formerly owned by Brazilian businessman Eike

Batista, was transferred to a Qatari investment group, which recently bought the company

for more than USD 400 million.”'®!

On 17 December 2014, the ANM sent a letter to MinAmbiente pursuant to the cooperation
principle enshrined in Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code, together with “Technical Studies
conducted in the Santurban paramo area, at scales of 1:250.000 and 1:100.000, and the
proposed line based on the mines surveyed in the mining censuses of 1966, 1997, 2000, and

2010, with the respective memorandum summarizing the reasons for the proposal.” \

The boundaries of the Santurban Paramo were eventually published on 19 December 2014
by means of Resolution 2090.'® The Resolution divided the paramo into three zones: (i) the
preservation zone; (ii) the restoration zone; and (iii) the sustainable use zone. The same
resolution made some exceptions to the general prohibition to carry out mining operations
in the area. Among other exceptions, the Resolution stipulated that mining operations could
be authorised and executed in the restoration zones of the paramo located in the
municipalities of Vetas, California and Surata (where Concession 3452 is located).
Additionally, and generally, the Resolution contained a grandfathering provision, similar
(but not identical) to that contained in Law 1382, which provided that those projects with a
mining concession contract and with an environmental control and management instrument
could continue with the operations despite being located in a paramo, not being nonetheless

entitled to any extension. According to ANM, there were 54 current mining titles

Mayor of California, '® in which he stated the following:

“In the opinion of the Mayor of California, it was clear that not even those
who delimited the Santurban paramo knew how to explain it.

‘At the meeting with prosecutor Ordojiez, it was clear that neither the
Ministry of Environment, nor the Alexander von Humboldt Institute, could
explain why the line was made as it was [...]. The Minister of the Environment
only went to Tona, and none of the Vice ministers that they sent walked on the
paramo, none went to the area, they did not look into the social and economic
aspects, and that is something the Court is not aware of.”

 

On 6 January 2015, following the delimitation of the Santurban Paramo by Resolution 2090,
ANM decided not to further extend the suspension of Eco Oro’s activities, on the basis that

the technical circumstances giving rise to the stay of the activities were deemed overcome.!”°

On 25 April 2015, a newspaper article reported that President Santos attended a mining
conference and stated the following: “What Colombia needs, I reiterate and would like to
say it again to you, is a strong, organized and competitive mining sector, especially now that
we are decisively moving in the direction towards peace and reconciliation.” According to
the same article, MinMinas promised at that conference “to support projects classified as

projects of national interest (the well-known PINEs) such as Eco Oro’s Angostura in

Santurban (Santander).”'

158. On 9 June 2015, Law 1753 (National Development Plan 2014-2018) was enacted, which
included exceptions similar to the ones in Resolution No. 2090.'!” The relevant provisions

of Law 1753 are as follows:

“Article 173. Protection and delimitation of paramos. No person may engage
in agricultural activities, exploration or exploitation of non-renewable
natural resources or construction of hydrocarbon refineries in the areas
delimited as paramos.

The Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development shall delimit
paramo areas within the area of reference defined in the map provided by the
Alexander Van Humboldt Institute at a scale of 1:100,000, or 1:25,000, if
available. In this area, the regional environmental authority shall conduct the
technical studies required to characterize the environmental, social, and
economic context pursuant to the terms of reference issued by the Ministry of
the Environment and Sustainable Development. Within such area, the
Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development shall delimit the
paramo area on the basis of technical, environmental, social, and economic
criteria.

Paragraph 1. Within the area delimited as paramo, those activities for the
exploration and exploitation of non-renewable natural resources that have a
contract and an environmental license with the equivalent environmental
control and management instrument, granted prior to February 9, 2010 for
mining activities, or prior to June 16, 2011 for activities involving
hydrocarbons respectively, may continue to be performed until termination
without extension. From the entry into force of this law, the Environmental
Authorities shall review the environmental licenses granted prior to the
effective date of the prohibition for the delimited paramo areas, and they shall
be subject to the control, follow-up, and review by the mining, hydrocarbons
and environmental authorities, within the scope of their powers and following
the guidelines issued for that purpose by the Ministry of the Environment and
Sustainable Development.

In any case, failure to comply with the terms and conditions under which the
mining or environmental licenses were granted will result in the expiration
of the mining title pursuant to the Colombian Mining Code, or in direct
revocation of the environmental license without the holder’s consent and
without right to compensation.

12 Law No. 1753 of 2015 (9 June 2015) (Exhibit C-36).

159.

160.

If, despite the existence of the environmental license, it is not possible to
prevent, mitigate, rectify, or compensate for any possible environmental
damage to the paramo ecosystem, the mining activity may not be continued.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, any entities falling
within its purview and the political-administrative subdivisions, in
coordination with the Regional Environmental Authorities and subject to the
guidelines of the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development,
shall agree on the design of, training on, and implementation of replacement
and conversion programs for any agricultural activities being conducted
prior to June 16, 2011 within the delimited paramo area, in order to ensure
the gradual application of the prohibition.

Paragraph 2. In the area of reference not included within the delimited
paramo area, it is forbidden to grant new mining titles, to enter into new
agreements for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons, or to
conduct new agricultural activities. This area shall be subject to organization
and comprehensive management by the authorities of the political-
administrative subdivisions pursuant to the guidelines issued by the Regional
Environmental Authorities, so as to mitigate and prevent any disturbances
affecting the area delimited as paramo and to contribute to the protection and
preservation thereof.

Paragraph 3. Within a period of three (3) years following the delimitation,
the environmental authorities shall zone and define the uses to be assigned to
the delimited paramo area pursuant to the guidelines issued for that purpose
by the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development.”

Law 1753 further established that ANLA would be fully and exclusively in charge of the
procedures regarding the environmental permits and licenses required for the performance
of the Strategic Projects of National Interest (PINEs) and that the persons in charge of the
projects validated as PINEs were to abandon any ongoing environmental procedures and

resubmit them to ANLA.

Eco Oro held meetings with the Minister of Mines and was informed that Ms. Claudia Pava
had been appointed as an official to remain in Bucaramanga and that her main goal was to

In December 2015, ANM published a brochure named “Exploring Opportunities.”!*° In this
investment promotion material, ANM included a legal disclaimer to the effect that the
information outlined in that publication had been prepared based on the existing rules and
that those rules could be amended at any time. ANM added that “Colombia occupies the 9th
place worldwide in proper climate for mining investments, improving two places since 2014
according to the report ‘Where to Invest in Mining 2015’ presented by the American
consulting firm Behre Dolbear.”'*! ANM further provided information detailing those
companies with projects in Colombia, mentioning “Eco Oro, Canada” (p. 24); Colombia’s
main institutions (pp. 26-27); the duration of the Concession Contract (p. 28); the type of
duties to be paid: surface canons / royalties (p. 33); and IIAs and FTAs entered into by
Colombia (p. 37). ANM warned prospective investors that they should verify whether the
proposed title was or was not within the prohibited areas for mining, whether it was in an
area with communities of ethnic minorities and/or in an environmental exclusion zone

(p. 30). No express reference was made to paramos.

On the basis of Law 1753, on 5 January 2016, Eco Oro requested ANLA to provide Terms

of Reference for the preparation of an EIA for an underground-mine project.'*?
On 25 January 2016, ANLA replied to Eco Oro’s request, asking Eco Oro to provide an

1,183

executive summary of the projec (Eco Oro did not pursue this, however, as the

Colombian Constitutional Court Judgment C-35 of 2016 referred to below, determined that
the provision of such Terms of Reference was in the competence of local/regional

authorities).

On 8 February 2016, the Colombian Constitutional Court issued Judgment C-35 of 2016,
(“Judgement C-35”)!*4 which, inter alia, struck down the provisions of Law 1753 of 2015
that established exceptions to the general prohibition to perform mining operations in the
paramo, including the exceptions that echoed the ones included in Resolution No. 2090
(mentioned above). Additionally, Judgment C-35 declared section 51 of Law 1753
unenforceable, thereby eliminating ANLA’s exclusive competence regarding the

environmental permits and licenses required for the performance of the PINEs.

This decision was the subject of two clarification requests, one from MinAmbiente!** and

the other from the ANM.'*° The two requests were denied by the Constitutional Court, the

187

first on procedural grounds'*’ and the second on the basis that the “jurisdiction of the

Constitutional Court is expressly set forth in Article 241, and does not include a role as an

advisory or consulting body to deal with the effects of its own decisions or the effectiveness

188

of legal or regulatory provisions. The decision was criticised by the mining sector,

which expressed concern for the “/egal instability in the country which was directly affecting
investments in, and the future of, mining operations.”'* After analysing the impact of the
unconstitutionality declaration rendered with regard to Article 173(1)(1) of Law 1753 on the

performance of mining concession contracts awarded prior to 9 February 2010, CIIPE

the unenforceability of the subsections of the provision challenged, which were intended to provide for the
implementation of an adjustment period, the Constitutional Court makes a radical choice which does nothing
but shift the attribution of damage. Consequently, any potential wrong caused will not be attributed to a
Legislative act but to a court decision. [...] when performing a ‘balancing exercise’, contractual rights cannot
be disregarded as under the balancing theory, the prevailing right must be able to absorb the damage caused
to the non-prevailing right and create additional profit. From the above it follows that the prevailing right
must be capable of compensating the holder of the non-prevailing right in such a way so as to secure the
protection of lawfully acquired rights.”

On 12 February 2016, Eco Oro first considered the commencement of dispute resolution
proceedings under the FTA.'®! On 7 March 2016, Eco Oro filed a Notice of Intent to submit
the claim to arbitration.'°* On 8 December 2016, Eco Oro filed its Request for Arbitration.
A newspaper article dated 26 March 2016 referred to the fact that three companies were
relying on the Free Trade Agreements executed by Colombia with the United States and

Canada to demand that the mining agreements involving strategic ecosystems be

honoured !*? writing:
“The delimitation of paramos in Colombia is paying off a_ historical
debt to the environment, but it is also creating a legal limbo for companies
that already held concessions with environmental licenses in those
strategic areas.

In addition to the delimitation of the Santurban paramo, eight other
ecosystems were delimited this week and the Government expects that, by the
end of this year, the other 27 high-mountain systems will have their
boundaries delimited to protect them from mining and hydrocarbons
extraction, following the decision of the Constitutional Court that, even
before its prohibition in 2010, there should not have been any projects in such
strategic areas. But the Government had allowed the continuation of such
projects until the expiration of the contracts, precisely to prevent legal
disputes.

According to the National Mining Authority (ANM), there are more than
475 mining titles — 286 in exploitation — that overlap with 28 paramos,
covering an area of 127,000 hectares. Such concessions are held by nearly
100 companies and 300 individuals who will have to cease their activities as
paramos continue to be delimited.

Eco Oro, formerly Greystar, a Canadian company that has been developing
the Angostura mining project for twenty years in the Santurban paramo, has
sparked the first flame. A couple of weeks ago, ignoring the authority of the
Ministry of Mines and the National Mining Authority, the company sent a
letter to President Juan Manuel Santos, communicating its intention to
formally initiate amicable settlement proceedings, invoking the provisions of
the free trade agreement with Canada that provide legal protection to foreign
companies.

[.]

‘We have invested USD 250 million, have progressed this project for twenty

years and the idea is to continue to make progress towards that goal,
obviously respecting the environment, the paramo. I have also seen the film
‘Wild Magic’ and we are all aware that this is an ecosystem we need to take
care of, but that does not entail that mining cannot be done. There are
compatibilities, and that is what we are looking for,’ stated Mark Moseley-
Williams, President of Eco Oro.

For such reason, the Government is debating whether to halt the mining
locomotive that it so enthusiastically announced in 2010 or to seek solutions
so that these businesses can carry out their mining projects without affecting
the ecosystems. How will it act with respect to the mining titles that overlap
with the paramos? Why did it grant concessions within those ecosystems?
How feasible is it that an international tribunal could undermine the
country’s autonomy?

The Minister of the Environment, Gabriel Vallejo, has already agreed that
there will be strict compliance with the judgment rendered by the
Constitutional Court, ordering the eradication of any mining activities
currently carried out in the paramos and that new mining titles in them not
be granted.

‘Following the resolutions that I have signed regarding the delimitation of
the paramos, with respect to mining and hydrocarbons, environmental
licenses shall, in accordance with the relevant limitations, cease to be in
force. And we are working with the Ministry of Mines to make a decision
regarding titles currently in force in order to have them terminated on the
basis of the Constitutional Court decision.’

77/387

In any case, the Minister said that companies are entitled to file any claims
they may consider appropriate if they believe their rights have been violated.
However, ‘we are abiding by a decision of the Court.’

Another question that comes into play is: Why did the Government grant
concessions in the ecosystems?

First, because doing so had only been impliedly prohibited under a section of
the 2010-2014 Development Plan, but with the exception that the companies
holding concessions with an environmental license granted prior to 2010
could perform exploitation activities in the paramos until their contracts were
terminated. However, that is what the high court objected to.

According to the former comptroller for environmental matters, Mauricio
Cabrera, he warned on several occasions, in his capacity as advisor to the
Ministry of the Environment, that granting titles in such areas would cause
legal problems in the future.

‘Later, in 2013, the Office of the Comptroller General issued a warning
because that year, the Government reopened the mining registry. We said it
was inappropriate and that under the circumstances it was not appropriate
to grant mining titles in the country again. Nevertheless, this is what
occurred.’

That is to say, the problem that the Executive attempted to avoid six years ago
has just reappeared with Eco Oro’s warning. However, this is not the only
one that the Colombian Government will have to face. Cosigo Resources and
Tobie Mining and Energy are already demanding compensation in the
amount of USD 16.5 billion. The companies argue that after the declaration
of the national natural park of the Yaigojé-Apaporis reserve, in 2007, their
mining rights were unlawfilly revoked, in violation of the Free Trade
Agreement with the United States. [...].”

194

a report entitled “Compliance Investigation, IFC Investment in Eco Oro (Project # 27961),

“[g]iven recent developments in Colombia, and in particular, the ANM’s recent withdrawal
of a significant portion of the mining title upon which the Project depends, we take the view
that the Project is unlikely to be developed further.’ The Center for International
Environmental Law (CIEL), an NGO, noted that “[t]e IFC’s divestment not only extricates

the Bank from a clear conflict of interest, but also highlights the presence of ill-advised

mining projects in the Colombian paramo and the illegitimacy of the suit.”!°°

On 21 July 2016, Eco Oro entered into an Investment Agreement with Trexs (“Investment

Agreement”).'°” According to Eco Oro’s announcement of 22 July 2016!%:

“The Investment, which is subject to customary terms and conditions, is going
to occur in two tranches. The first tranche (‘Tranche 1’), which is closed
concurrently with the execution of the Agreement, is for US$3 million and the
second tranche (‘Tranche 2’) is for US$11 million. The Company has issued
10,608,225 common shares, which represents 9.99% of the Company’s issued
and outstanding shares, to the Investor pursuant to Tranche 1.

The Company will call a meeting of its shareholders to obtain shareholder
approval for the issuance of common shares pursuant to Tranche 2. Pursuant
to Tranche 2, the Company will issue 84,590,427 common shares, which will
result in the Investor owning an aggregate of 49.99% of the Company's
issued and outstanding shares and an unsecured convertible note in the
principal amount of US$7 million (the ‘Note’). In the event that shareholder
approval is not obtained, Tranche 2 will consist of the Note and secured
contingent value rights (the ‘CVR’), entitling the Investor to 51% of the gross
proceeds of the Arbitration.”

On 26 July 2016, ANM informed Eco Oro that, on the basis of overlap between the area
granted under Concession 3452 and the Santurban Paramo Preservation Zone, “the surface
canon to be paid by the concession holder [would] need to be assessed and paid solely on
the non-overlapping area, provided that no mining activity [was] permitted to be carried out
on the remaining piece of land.”'? Eco Oro replied to ANM on 5 August 2016, insisting
that the full surface canon would be paid on the basis that, to that date, Concession 3452 was
valid, had not been modified and its extension was pending. °° On 3 November 2016, ANM
approved the payment of “surface canon fees in the amount of COP 118,769,899 for the

tenth year of the exploration period under Concession Contract No. 3452, which shall extend

from 9 August 2016 through 8 August 2017.”2°!

On 8 August 2016, Eco Oro was notified that ANM had approved Eco Oro’s application for
the fourth two-year extension of the exploration stage under Concession 3452. 7°? In its
decision, ANM highlighted that the extension applied “exclusively with respect to the area

that does not overlap with the ZP — JURISDICTIONS — SANTURBAN — BERLIN paramo

“This measure strongly affects the Angostura Project, since [it] deprives
Eco Oro’s mining rights, specifically 50.73% of the area of Mining
Concession 3452, and makes it seriously question its viability.

In this sense, this document is intended to describe the activities to be carried

out during the extension, which are aimed at establishing whether or not it is

viable to i developing the A ‘a Project, idering the new

measure adopted.

We clarify that submission of this present proposal of works does not suppose
nor can be interpreted, in any way, as project viability.

Constitutional Court decision with respect to the action for the protection of constitutional

rights requested from that Court against Resolution 2090 of 2014.7°°

On 17 January 2017, Technical Opinion VSC 3 was issued by the ANM titled “Assessment
of Complementary Document on the Extension of Exploration Stage” one of the conclusions
of which (2.1.4.1) stated: “However, following Resolution 2090 of December 19, 2014,
whereby the Santurbaén Paramo is delimited, it is necessary to clarify whether mining
operations in the ‘Zones for the restoration of the paramo ecosystem’ can be executed or
not. Furthermore, it needs to be defined if this area is part of the ‘Santurban-Berlin Paramo
Area.’ [...] Therefore this aspect needs clarification, from a legal standpoint, as to whether
mining is permitted in this area, or not, pursuant to the provisions of Resolution 2090 of
December 19, 2014 and Court Judgement C-035 of February 8, 2016 on the paramos. [...].”
Paragraph 2.1.4.4 noted: “Please send this technical opinion to the legal office of the Projects

of National Interest Group, to make the necessary clarification.”?”
On 8 February 2017, the ANM issued Resolution VSC 10 which, inter alia, stated:

“Consequently, and in accordance with the provisions of Resolution No. 0206
of 22 March 2013, the Vice Presidency for Mining Monitoring, Control and
Safety of the National Mining Agency rules:

directors.?!! On 27 March 2017, the Requisitioning Shareholders issued a Circular entitled

“Let’s Fix Eco Oro.”?!?

On 7 March 2017, Eco Oro requested ANM to authorise the suspension of Eco Oro’s
obligations under Concession 3452 pursuant to Article 51 of the 2001 Mining Code, on the
basis of force majeure or unforeseeable circumstances (caso fortuito).”'? According to
Eco Oro, the delineation of the Santurban Paramo had become uncertain following both
Judgment C- 35 and given that a decision of the same Constitutional Court was expected in
a tutela action concerning Resolution 2090. Eco Oro further alluded to an additional source
of uncertainty, arising from the fact that some decisions by ANM identified that mining was
prohibited in the preservation zone, whereas other decisions noted that such prohibition
extended to the restoration zone as well. Finally, Eco Oro stressed that the CDMB
(the environmental authority responsible for licensing the Project) had recently informed
Eco Oro that, given the lack of clarity regarding the regulatory framework applicable to the
Project, it was not in a position to process or grant an environmental license requested by
Eco Oro so that the Angostura Project could progress to the construction and mounting and,

subsequently, exploitation phases, until the litigation currently on foot was resolved.

On 23 March 2017, Eco Oro replied to ANM with regard to Resolution VSC 10, noting that
it was not the competent authority for making this type of determinations: the Colombian
State and particularly the mining and environmental authorities were the bodies that should
develop the guidelines that the mining title holder was to follow, in accordance with their

own interpretation of the Law and case law.?!+

On 24 April 2017, the Supreme Court of British Columbia rendered a Judgment?! with
regard to a petition by the Requisitioning Shareholders to set aside the issuance of shares by
Eco Oro’s Board of Directors to Trexs, Amber Capital LP (“Amber”),”!° Paulson & Co. Inc.
(“Paulson”)*!’ and Ms. Anna Stylianides (“Ms. Stylianides”) on the basis of oppression.
The petition was dismissed, inter alia, because the Supreme Court considered that
“[t]he petitioners [were] sophisticated investors and invested in Eco Oro with their eyes

open and with full knowledge of the Investment Agreements and Notes.”?'®

On 11 May 2017, during his speech in the National Mining Congress, the Minister of Mines
addressed the Constitutional Court decisions that declared several articles of the
2001 Mining Code unenforceable. According to the Minister of Mines, “we have been left

in a very serious situation: there are many norms and we do not know what the rule is. We

fill legal loopholes with decrees.” The head of the Mining department added that many of

the current problems in the sector, in terms of regulation, come from “not having regulated
the Constitution of 1991; for 25 years, some principles have remained open to interpretation.
Winds of change started to blow and so did interpretations.” The Minister of Mines further

stated that “The Court is breaking a golden rule by legislating. The Court is legislating and

laws are made by Congress.”?'°

On 22 August 2017, ANM refused to grant a further suspension of obligations under
Concession 3452, on the basis that the events invoked by Eco Oro were not unforeseeable.”
The same Agency decided a suspension request submitted by Eco Oro with respect to a

different mining title concluding that the obligations should be suspended on the basis of

force majeure.”?!

On 11 September 2017, Eco Oro announced, inter alia, that Trexs had agreed to loan

USD 4 million to Eco Oro.?”

On 12 September 2017, Eco Oro issued a notice of annual general and special meeting
of shareholders and management information circular for a meeting to be held on

10 October 2017.73

Nearly one year after it had been filed, on 13 October 2017, ANM approved the PTO filed
by Sociedad Minera de Santander S.A.S. (“Minesa”) — the holder of a mining concession
that was completely surrounded by Concession 3452 — for the furtherance of its Soto Norte
mining project “provided that its execution does not interfere with the rights of the holders
of concession contract No. 3452 and Exploitation License 0105-68 and other holders that
could be affected.”** On 8 November 2017, Eco Oro appealed that decision.?7>
On 21 November 2017, the Minister of Environment stated that the decision over the

environmental license to be granted to Minesa would be put on hold until the delimitation of

the Santurban Paramo is revised.?° The Minister of Environment further stated that “[e]ach

potential effect must be examined in detail because it is a lie that we are trying to swap water

for gold.” On 21 March 2019, ANM decided not to reverse its decision.”

On 17 October 2017, Trexs announced that the convertible note had been rescinded and that,
following the rescission, Trexs was “the owner of and has control and direction over
10,608,225 Shares, or approximately 9.9% of the Shares issued and outstanding following
the recission and the recission of certain other Share issuances effected on the conversion

of other Notes.”??8

On 10 November 2017, the Colombian Constitutional Court published Judgment T- 361/17
(dated 30 May 2017) rendered in a tutela action, whereby Resolution 2090 was struck down
and a re-delimitation of the Santurban Paramo was required due to lack of public
consultation.””’ In this decision, the Constitutional Court asserted that MinAmbiente had
“acted in bad faith insofar as it interpreted the law in a manner that hindered access to
information. This is so because it refused to provide the maps that were communicated on
March 31, 2014 on the grounds that it had not yet issued the delimitation administrative
decision, an argument that ignores the fact that the request concerned preparatory or
provisional documents.” However, the Constitutional Court determined that the
unenforceability of Resolution 2090 would only become effective one year as from the date
of notification of its Judgment. The Constitutional Court further directed MinAmbiente to
issue a new resolution delimiting the Paramo in the Jurisdictions of Santurban — Berlin,
which administrative decision was to be issued as a result of a prior, participative, effective

and deliberative proceeding, within one year following the notification of the Judgment.

190. On 17 November 2017, the Attorney General requested the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (“UNESCO”) to include Colombian Paramo
Ecosystems as a World Heritage Site.>° On 12 February 2018, during a Video Tweet,”*!
the Attorney General confirmed that the Office was “currently working so the request is

accepted.” The Attorney General also stated the following:

“Answer: ‘Good afternoon. The truth is that paramos are strategic
ecosystems because they are the main matting that protects and allows the
distribution of water in our country. We are lucky to have around 50% of all
the paramos in the world here in Colombia. This is why the Administrative
Prosecutor's Office, through the head of environmental matters, adopted
several measures to protect these ecosystems.

[...] Also, recently, we requested from the National Mining Agency the
exclusion of all protected areas, particularly paramos, and that all works and

 

 

activities tl 1 by ires be i diately suspended and
abandoned without compensation, as mandated by Article 36 of the current
Mining Code.

And regarding the Santurban paramo, in light of the Constitutional Court’s
decision, we are following up on the discussions held with the Ministry of the
Environment and, of course, we are working towards the pdaramo’s
delimitation before the end of the current administration.’

Question: ‘What do you mean by ‘abandoned’?’

Answer: ‘I mean that, sometimes, mining areas overlap with protected areas
because titles were granted on protected areas where mining cannot be
conducted. So, pursuant to the applicable regulations, the Administrative
Prosecutor's Office has insisted on this because there are several titles
currently in force that overlap with areas where mining is prohibited.”

On 16 April 2018, the ANM confirmed its decision to reject Eco Oro’s suspension request.?>

On 21 June 2018, Eco Oro informed ANM that it found itself prevented from fulfilling its
obligation to submit a PTO before the end of the time period established by Articles 84 and
281 of the 2001 Mining Code (i.e., 21 June 2018), due to increased legal uncertainty
regarding Eco Oro’s right to carry out mining activities in the area of Concession 3452 and
the absence of information about the new boundaries of the Santurban Paramo that were yet

to be issued by MinAmbiente in compliance with Judgment T-361/17.7*+

On 30 August 2018, MinAmbiente applied to the Santander Administrative Tribunal for an
extension of time to comply with Judgement T-361, stating: “[...] the remaining period of
approximately 2 months is insufficient to comply with that ordered, and it is therefore
necessary to extend this term by an additional 8 months, which this Ministry considers
suitable for the situation at hand and which will allow all phases of the participation process

d

to be satisf ua. ing an effective exercise of fund

1 rights.”*>> This request
was granted on 9 October 2018 by the Santander Administrative Tribunal which clarified
that “the new delimitation of the Santurbdn-Berlin paramo which should be adopted by the
Ministry of Environment may not be issued on a date later than eight months after the end
of the term of one year set out in article 5 of the resolving part of Judgment T- 361/2017.”?°
That meant that the new delimitation should be issued by no later than 15 July 2019.

On 27 July 2018, Law No. 1930 fixed paramos as strategic ecosystems and provided for its
integral management.” The development of mining exploration and exploitation activities

is prohibited under Article 5 of this Law as follows:

“The development of projects, works or activities in paramos will be subject
to the corresponding Environmental Management Plans. In any case, the
following prohibitions will be taken into account:

On 30 August 2018, ANM granted Eco Oro a time extension until 30 November 2018 to
comply with its duty to submit the PTO.?°*

On 23 November 2018, Eco Oro requested that the current deadline be extended until 15
October 2019 (3 months after the expiration of the deadline set in Judgment T-361/17 for
the new boundaries of the Santurban Paramo to be issued”*’). On 24 December 2018, ANM
rejected Eco Oro’s request, asserting that there was no valid basis for extending the deadline
for submission of the PTO.*4° On 14 February 2019, ANM required Eco Oro, at risk of
being fined, to submit the PTO within 30 days.7*!

On 9 November 2018, the Attorney General’s Office and the Ombudsman’s Office prepared
its third compliance report with respect to the actions taken by MinAmbiente pursuant to

Judgement T-361 noting, inter alia, that MinAmbiente had “[...] made no substantial

progress in terms of compliance with the orders of the Honourable Constitutional Court.”?*

On 15 March 2019, the Attorney General’s Office and the Ombudsman’s Office prepared its
fourth compliance report noting “[...] Finally, the Public Ministry observes with concern the
short time remaining to fulfil the pending phases of the schedule effectively, given that they
are the most significant in accordance with the in the [sic] findings of law considered in

granting protection under the constitutional claim [tutela] petition, namely: to guarantee full

to MinMinas) and C-424 (Letter to MinAmbiente), which have similar contents, Eco Oro states, inter alia, the
following:

 

“As set out below, certain measures adopted by the Colombian government, particularly the
ANM, have rendered ECO ORO’s Angostura Project in Concession 3452 unviable and left
ECO ORO with no choice but to renounce Cc ion 3452 in order to mitigate its losses

bel

5. Against this backdrop, ECO ORO commenced na arbitration against the Republic of
Colombia under the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia
in order to seek compensation for the destruction of the value of its investments in
Concession 3452 and the Project. In liance with its obligations under
international law, ECO ORO adopted measures to preserve the status quo with respect to
Concession 3452 so as to protect all available options to mitigate its losses.

bel

As a result, at present, the exploration phase of Concession 3452 has formally ended and
thus ECO ORO has no choice but to formally renounce the Concession in order to mitigate
its losses and thus among other things, (a) avoid the continuing costs related to the mine's
maintenance and safety; and (b) avoid a declaration of caducity (caducidad) that could
impede the conclusion of the sale and transfer of certain mining titles by ECO ORO to
Minesa.”

Environment, Ricardo Lorenzo, was present along with “[...] more than a thousand people
[...]”, during which the Minister confirmed consultations had already been held in 25
municipalities, with nearly 300 proposals being submitted and further confirmed that “[...]
there is no intention of removing communities from their territories. On the contrary, [...]
the goal is to work with them, as part of a democratic participation process that is meant to
adequately delimit this ecosystem which is of strategic importance for the country.” The
article further summarised the views of the Mayor of Vetas, who explained that the
inhabitants of the municipality were seeking a guaranteed right to work, to continue mining

and low-impact agricultural and livestock activities.74*

On 29 July 2019, ANM visited the site of Concession 3452.74

In November 2019, MinAmbiente issued a proposal for the new delimitation of the
Santurban Paramo.”*° The new delimitation proposal was not significantly different from

Eco Oro alleges having spent more than USD 250 million in advancing the

Angostura Project.”

According to Compass Lexecon, “Eco Oro spent approximately USD 258 million from 1997
to 2018 based on audited financial statements for Greystar and Eco Oro. [...] Exploration
and evaluation costs totaled USD 198 million, of which USD 51 million are related to
drilling, USD 56 million to exploration and technical studies, and USD 35 million to
administrative purposes. General and administrative expenses totaled USD 58 million, of
which USD 26 million went to audit, accounting and legal expenses and USD 11 million for

salaries and benefits.”

Charles River Associates (CRA), in turn, proposed corrected calculations of the historical

costs incurred by Eco Oro with respect with the Project, submitting that the “revised estimate

Jor the relevant time period is approximately $40 million.”??

The Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the relevant rule on the interpretation of treaties is
that embodied in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969
(the “VCLT”).?7! The supplementary means of interpretation of treaties is set out in

Article 32 of the VCLT. Articles 31 and 32 provide as follows:

“Article 31. GENERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context
and in the light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall
comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all
the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in
connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the
other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which
establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its
interpretation;

(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations
between the parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the
parties so intended.

Article 32. SUPPLEMENTARY MEANS OF INTERPRETATION

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the
preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in
order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or
to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:

(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.”

212. As mentioned above, Article 832(1) of the FTA provides that “[a]n interpretation by the
Commission of a provision of this Agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal established
under this Section, and any award or other ruling under this Section shall be consistent with
the interpretation.” It shall be noted that, on 24 October 2017, the Commission issued

Decision No. 6 (“Commission’s Decision”),”” providing, inter alia, as follows:

“The Joint Commission, acting under subparagraph 3(a) of Article 2001 of
the Colombia-Canada Free Trade Agreement (hereinafter, the ‘Agreement’),
reviewed Chapter Eight of the Agreement. In this respect, the Joint
Commission decided that Articles 803, 804 and 805 be authoritatively
interpreted as follows in order to clarify and reaffirm their meaning:

1. Investment and Regulatory Measures

For the purpose of Chapter Eight, the Parties reaffirm the right of each Party
to regulate within its territory to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as
the promotion or protection of safety, health, the environment, cultural
diversity or gender equality, or social or consumer protection.

2. National Treatment and Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment

(a) Whether treatment is accorded in ‘like circumstances’ under Articles 803
and 804 depends on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the
relevant treatment distinguishes between investors or covered investments on
the basis of legitimate policy objectives.

Decision No. 6 (24 October 2017) (Exhibit R-139).

(b) The ‘treatment’ referred to in Article 804 does not include procedures for
the resolution of investment disputes between investors and States provided
Sor i in other international investment treaties and other trade agreements. In

ive obligations in other inte l in treaties
and other trade agreements do not in themselves constitute ‘treatment’, and
thus cannot give rise to a breach of Article 804, absent measures adopted or
maintained by a Party.

 

3. Minimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with International Law

(a) The concept of ‘full protection and security’ in Article 805 refers to a
Party’s obligations relating to the physical security of investors and covered
investments.

(b) If an investor of a Party submits a claim under Section B of Chapter Eight,
including a claim alleging that a Party has breached Article 805, the investor
has the burden of proving all elements of its claim, consistent with general
principles of international law applicabl
This includes the burden to prove a rule of customary international law
invoked under Article 805, through evidence of the elements of customary
international law referred to in footnote 2 of Chapter Eight.

CLOSING PROVISION

The adoption by the Joint Commission of this or any future interpretation
does not indicate an absence of agreement between the Parties about other
matters of interpretation of the Agreement.”

213. It shall be noted, nonetheless, that the Claimant challenges the applicability of the

Commission’s Decision in the present case, as it was rendered almost a year after Eco Oro
commenced this arbitration against Colombia. According to the Claimant, that would
retroactively modify Article 805 of the Treaty, in violation of Article 28 of the VCLT.2?
The Respondent, in turn, submits that the Claimant’s argument is without merit, as the
Commission’s Decision “merely confirms the meaning of the FTA as it already existed.
It does not seek to modify the text in accordance with the existing international law

jurisprudence.”?"*

to the Respondent, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide the present dispute~’’ on the

grounds that:

a. Colombia has validly denied the benefits of Chapter Eight of the FTA to Eco Oro
in accordance with Article 814(2) of the Treaty (“Article 814(2)”);

b. Eco Oro is not a protected investor under the FTA, because it assigned its claims to

non-Canadian nationals;

c. Eco Oro has failed to comply with four of the mandatory conditions precedent to
arbitration provided for in Article 821 of the FTA, including failing to bring its

claims within the limitation period;
d. Eco Oro’s claims fall outside of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis; and
e. Eco Oro’s claims fall outside of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae.

A, WHETHER COLOMBIA HAS VALIDLY DENIED THE BENEFITS OF CHAPTER EIGHT OF THE
FTA TO ECO ORO IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 814(2) OF THE FTA

217. Article 814(2) provides as follows:

“A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of the other
Party that is an enterprise of such Party and to investments of that investor if
investors of a non-Party or of the denying Party own or control the enterprise
and the enterprise has no substantial business activities in the territory of the
Party under whose law it is constituted or organized.”

(1) The Parties’ Positions
(a) The Respondent’s Position

218. The Respondent submits that Article 814(2) permits State parties to deny the advantages of
the Treaty, including access to international arbitration, to companies which are owned or
controlled by nationals of third States and have no substantial business in their State of
incorporation. This provision is similar to the counterpart provisions in NAFTA, CAFTA

and certain BITs and serves to safeguard against “free-rider” investors.”

219. According to the Respondent, it validly exercised its right to deny Eco Oro the benefits of
the FTA by letter dated 15 December 2016,7*° on the grounds that Eco Oro (i) was owned

or controlled by nationals of non-Parties (i.e., non-Canadians) and (ii) had no substantial

business activities in the territory of Canada.?*!

(i) Nationals of Non-Parties Owned or Controlled Eco Oro at the time
Eco Oro Sought to Invoke the Protections of the FTA

As at the date of its Request for Arbitration (i.e., 8 December 2016), Eco Oro had not
satisfied the conditions stipulated in Article 814(2), so far as its ultimate ownership and
control were concerned.”*

Eco Oro’s incorporation in Canada is irrelevant: Colombia needs only to show that Eco Oro
is either owned or controlled by investors of a non-Party. Indeed, Eco Oro does not even
meet its own “chosen” definition that “ownership” and “control” exist if “a non-Party
owns more than 50% of its shares, or exercises de facto control over the company through
the operation and the selection of members of its board of directors or any other
managing body.”

Turning first to ownership, Eco Oro’s public filings confirm that, at the relevant time,
Delaware corporations Amber, Paulson and Trexs, together with Bermudan corporation
Harrington, owned 49.61% of Eco Oro’s shares as of December 2016.78 There is no
requirement, either in the FTA or by reason of any authorities, that the ownership or control
must be by a single non-Canadian entity or that if more than one entity, they must be shown
to be acting in concert. Colombia relies on a plain reading of the Treaty: Eco Oro has not
denied that a majority of Eco Oro’s beneficial owners were non-Canadian at the relevant
time and, as 49.61% of its shareholding was owned by Delaware corporations (Amber,
Paulson and Trexs) and Bermudan company (Harrington), “the obvious inference is that a

majority of Eco Oro’s shareholders were non-Canadian.”?*>

a. Secured Contingent Value Rights (“CVRs”) entitling Trexs to 51% of the gross
proceeds of this arbitration and granting Trexs the benefit of covenants and rights

In addition, each Participating Shareholder entered into a separate investment agreement
pursuant to which they were issued CVRs granting them 19.3% of the proceeds of the
arbitration such that the Participating Shareholders were together granted 70.93% of the
proceeds of the arbitration. This gave them the right to control both Eco Oro and its claim.

Whilst the terms of the CVRs are not public, an Eco Oro shareholder circular stated that:

“[A] change of control would not be possible without the consent of Tenor,
and the CVRs in effect allow Tenor and the Participating Shareholders to
have full control over the Arbitration and other operations of Eco Oro.

[J

The Investment Agreement, including the issuance of the CVRs, differ from
customary arrangements to finance the Arbitration in that they provide for:
[...] control of the Arbitration vesting in Tenor and the Participating
Shareholders rather than the Company; events of default that effectively
prevent any change of control of the company or of management.”?!

Chapter 418, Article 1(1) of the British Columbia Securities Act defines a “control person”

as follows:?°

“[I]f a person or combination of persons holds more than 20% of the voting
rights attached to all outstanding voting securities of an issuer, the person or
combination of persons is deemed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary,
to hold a sufficient number of the voting rights to affect materially the control
of the issuer{.]”
Given the Participating Shareholders held (i) shareholdings in excess of the 20% threshold;
and (ii) rights under their respective investment agreements, Eco Oro was controlled by the

Participating Shareholders.

(ii) Eco Oro Had No Substantial Business Activities in Canada

At all material times, Eco Oro’s sole business focus has been the Angostura Project as

evidenced, for example, by its Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended

Angostura Project Eco Oro also described itself to the MinMinas as “genuinely

amount to “substantial business activities’ whether or not taken individually or
cumulatively: they are corporate, financing and administrative activities and not business

activities and as such are “ancillary, secondary activities that do not form a part of Eco Oro’s

business. To be substantial requires “at a minimum” activities “beyond the normal

activities or functions required merely by the fact of its corporate existence [...].”?°" Indeed,

to have had substantial business activities in Canada, Eco Oro would have needed to have

acquired mining titles in Canada*”® and can only rely on its own activities and not on the

activities of third parties in Canada. 7”

(iii) Colombia Has Validly Denied the Benefits of Chapter Eight of the FTA to
Eco Oro in Accordance with Article 814(2)

Colombia validly exercised its right to deny the benefits of Chapter Eight to Eco Oro by its

6,300

communication of 15 December 201 which was issued one week after Colombia

received Eco Oro’s Request for Arbitration. That was the time at which it should “analyse
whether the objective conditions for the denial are met and, if so, decide on whether to
exercise its right to deny the benefits.”*°' A ‘retroactive’ denial would not be contrary to the
Treaty’s objective and purpose. Eco Oro knew that it had no substantial business activities

in Canada and that it was owned or controlled by non-Canadians and so would have been

aware that Colombia could exercise this right at the time it made its investment. The Treaty

protections are thus conditional upon Colombia’s right to deny Eco Oro such benefits.*°”

The FTA wording is clear and unambiguous: the ordinary meaning of the denial of benefits
provision contains no express requirement that a denial of benefits may only be invoked
prospectively and there is no compelling basis on which such a requirement should be
implied. Indeed, there is no limitation in the FTA as to the time at which Colombia may
exercise its right to deny the benefits of Chapter Eight, the only applicable time limit being
that imposed by ICSID Arbitration Rule 41 requiring a respondent to submit its jurisdictional
objections no later than the date fixed for the filing of the Counter-Memorial (which time

limit Colombia complied with).

Further, the FTA is based on the Canadian model foreign investment promotion and
protection agreement which includes a denial of benefits clause which reproduces the
equivalent provision in NAFTA Article 1113(2), subjecting the State’s exercise of denial of

benefits to “prior notification and consultation.” As this specific prior notification and
consultation language is omitted from the FTA, Canada and Colombia must have expressly
decided not to subject the exercise of denial of benefits to “prior notification and
consultation.” Eco Oro’s response that the parties to the FTA thought these words were
unnecessary or implied is unsupported by evidence, inherently improbable and based entirely
on conjecture. The logical inference is that the parties to the FTA intended to omit the

requirement.

In support of its submissions, in addition to the Ulysseas and Guaracachi decisions,

Colombia also cites the decisions in Pac Rim?® and Empresa Eléctrica del Ecuador.*"*

The object and purpose of a treaty cannot give rise to limitations of the rights of a State

through the imposition of new conditions for the exercise of its rights that are not provided

305

for under such treaty.*°’ Canada and Colombia did not include any requirement as to the

time by when such a denial should be invoked, hence no such requirement falls to be

imposed.*°°

Finally, the reason the relevant time to assess compliance with the nationality requirements
of ownership and control is at the time an investor files its Request for Arbitration is precisely
because it is only at this time that a State can consider and exercise its denial of benefit rights;

it would be unworkable for it to be expected to investigate the nationality of an investor’s

ownership or control each time an investment is made.*°”

In Pac Rim, El Salvador raised denial of benefits as an objection to jurisdiction over two years after the claimant
had submitted its claim to arbitration. The United States filed a submission as a Non-Disputing Party, observing
that any requirement that a DR-CAFTA Party invoke the denial of benefits clause before a claim is submitted
to arbitration “would place an untenable burden on [that] Party [...] to monitor the ever-changing business
activities of all enterprises in the territories of each of the other six CAFTA-DR Parties that attempt to make,
are making or have made investments in the territory of the respondent.” Agreeing with this submission and
applying Article 31(1) of the VCLT to the interpretation of the denial of benefits clause, the tribunal concluded
that “[t]here is no express time-limit in CAFTA for the election by a CAFTA Party to deny benefits” and “the
Respondent's consent to ICSID Arbitration in CAFTA [...] is necessarily qualified from the outset by [the
denial of benefits clause at] Article 10.12.2”. Having found that both the substantive and procedural
requirements for the denial of benefits were met, the tribunal dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction. See

(b) The Claimant’s Position
(i) Colombia Cannot Deny Eco Oro the Benefits of the Treaty

Colombia cannot retrospectively deny Eco Oro the benefits of the FTA; in any event,
Colombia has failed to show either that Eco Oro is owned or controlled by non-Party

investors or that it has no substantial business activities in Canada.

The purpose of a denial of benefits provision is to give a State the opportunity to counteract
nationality planning and protect itself from abuse by investors whose investment the State
did not want to protect (i.e., free-riding or treaty shopping via corporate structuring).
The present case is precisely the converse: Eco Oro is a Canadian company that has made
investments directly into Colombia for over two decades, its Canadian nationality having
been acknowledged by Colombia during the totality of this time and its investments in
Colombia having been praised by Colombia.*”* It is of note that Colombia has not even been

able to identify the non-Party State whose nationals it claims own or control Eco Oro.

(ii) Colombia Cannot Retroactively Deny Eco Oro the Benefits of the Treaty

Article 814(2) must be interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning in light of the
object and purpose of the FTA. The preamble of the FTA states that the object and purpose
of the FTA is, inter alia, to “ensure a predictable commercial framework for business
planning and investment.” Permitting a retroactive denial of the Treaty’s benefits would
achieve precisely the opposite — a putative investor would have no certainty as to whether

its investment would or would not be protected.

. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention specifies that the date on which the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction is to be evaluated is the date on which the Request for Arbitration is filed.
Pursuant to the ICSID Convention, “[w]hen the parties have given their consent, no party
may withdraw its consent unilaterally.” Colombia’s consent is provided for in the FTA and
Eco Oro’s consent was given when it filed its Request for Arbitration. At that point, consent
to arbitration was perfected and from that date, pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID

Convention, Colombia could not thereafter deny the benefits of the Treaty to Eco Oro insofar

as they apply to the present dispute. This interpretation is supported by Plama*” and the
vast majority of decisions that have been determined subsequently. The fact that most of
these cases have been decided under the Energy Charter Treaty (the “ECT”) is irrelevant
—the underlying principle and logic applied by the respective tribunals apply with equal force
here. Just as Article 17(1) of the ECT (i) requires the relevant State to give notice of the
denial to the investor (it sets forth a reservation of rights mechanism which to be effective
must be exercised), (ii) is phrased in the present tense*!° and (iii) has, as its object and
purpose, the need for certainty and predictability, the same applies to Article 814(2). The use
of the word “may” in Article 814(2) indicates that the State has to take a decision which must
be communicated to the investor. Once it is accepted that notice must be given, such notice

can only have prospective effect.*!!

The words excluded from the Canadian model foreign investment promotion and protection
agreement (the reference to “prior notification and consultation’) have no linkage with the
retrospective denial of benefits. In any event, the mere absence of words is insufficient,
without evidence, to draw any conclusion as to the joint intention of the parties to the FTA.
An absence of requirement for prior notification for a denial of benefits is at odds with the
object and purpose of the FTA; in any event, Colombia did give notice to Eco Oro and must
therefore accept that provision of notice was a prerequisite to denying the benefits of

Chapter Eight of the FTA.

Finally, whilst the relevant time for assessing the substantive requirements of Article 25(1)
of the ICSID Convention was the date of filing of the Request for Arbitration, that does not
mean Colombia did not need to raise its jurisdictional objections based on the denial of
benefits provisions until it filed its Counter-Memorial. Referring back to the need for
certainty, if Colombia could deny the benefits of the FTA to an otherwise putative qualifying

investor without ever telling it so, such an investor would not be operating within a

“predictable” framework and long-term business planning and investment would be

frustrated.

(iii) The Conditions For Invoking the Treaty’s Denial of Benefits Are Not Met

The correct test as to whether a non-Party owns or control a majority of the voting stock is
not 50% +1 but even if it were, Colombia has failed to meet it. To have the right to deny the
benefits of the FTA to Eco Oro, Colombia must show either that the alleged non-Party or
Parties have outright ownership of 100% of Eco Oro’s equity or, alternatively, that such
investors are able to exercise de facto control by their ownership of more than 50% of the

voting stock.

With respect to the test of “ownership”, the ordinary meaning of the word “own” implies
outright ownership. In breach of the VCLT, Colombia imports into the text the concept of
majority ownership. Eco Oro is owned by the holders of its common shares which were at
the relevant time (and still are) traded on the stock exchange. Eco Oro is not required by
law to maintain any record of the nationality of its shareholders. The same applies to its
beneficial owners. Eco Oro is obliged?!” to maintain a central securities register recording
(i) the name and last known address of each registered shareholder and (ii) the number of
shares held. However, this requirement does not apply to the beneficial owners of its shares.
Pursuant to section 87 of the Securities Act of British Columbia, shareholders that own or
control 10% or more of its issued shares must file a report which is publicly available

disclosing the volume of shares owned or controlled.

Even if ownership included majority ownership, the three documents referenced by
Colombia*"* do not evidence Colombia’s assertion that, according to its public filings, the
share ownership percentage of three of its shareholders amounted to 49.61% as of
December 2016. No inference should be drawn as to the nationality of its shareholding from

the non-production of information to which Eco Oro has no access. Were Colombia’s

construction to be correct, if over 50% of Eco Oro’s stock were owned by non-Canadian
investors, even if each such investor only owned a single share, on the basis that collectively
they would own over 50%, Eco Oro would be held to be owned or controlled by investors
of anon-Party. This is nonsensical. Investors cannot make decisions for Eco Oro; that is a
matter that is determined by its governance structure. In any event, all non-Party investors
must be from the same third country, as is clear from the text that specifies the investors
must be from “a non-Party” (the Tribunal’s emphasis following Eco Oro’s argument). As its
shares are listed on a liquid stock exchange, Eco Oro’s shareholders frequently change and
it would generate significant uncertainty if the right to be assured of treaty protection

depended on the dynamics of the stock market on any particular day.

With respect to “control”, at the relevant date, no shareholder owned (whether as the
registered owner or beneficially) 20% or more of Eco Oro’s outstanding shares. Therefore,
no one owned the 50% +1 threshold required to constitute control for the purposes of
Article 814(2). Colombia has adduced no evidence in support of its assertion that the

Participating Shareholders were acting in concert.

Colombia’s references to Canadian domestic law are irrelevant: the FTA must be interpreted
according the provision its ordinary meaning. However, even if Canadian domestic
legislation were relevant, Colombia has referred to the wrong Canadian statute — the
Securities Act of British Columbia (which does not address issues of control) instead of the

Business Corporations Act of British Columbia, which provides as follows:

“[A] corporation is controlled by a person if (a) shares of the corporation are
held, other than by way of security only, by the person, or are beneficially
owned, other than by way of security only, by (i) the person, or (ii) a
corporation controlled by the person, and (b) the votes carried by the shares
mentioned in paragraph (a) are sufficient, if exercised, to elect or appoint a
majority of the directors of the corporation.”>'*

The question of “control” is fundamentally a question of corporate law and the correct statute

is the Business Corporations Act of British Columbia.*!> No non-Party exercised de facto

control: at the relevant time the Board of Directors comprised eight members and no
shareholder had sufficient shares to be able to control the appointment of directors to the
Board. Pursuant to its Articles of Association,*!© Eco Oro is governed by two bodies: (i) the
shareholders, who take decisions on either a two-thirds supermajority basis or a simple
majority basis depending on the nature of the issue to be decided upon; and (ii) the board of
directors, who are appointed by the shareholders and who take decisions on those issues
delegated to it on a majority basis. Pursuant to these provisions, a shareholder would need
to have appointed at least four of the six directors to be able to “control” Eco Oro and that
could only be achieved by a shareholder holding in excess of 50% of the voting stock. On the

relevant date (as detailed above) no shareholder held that percentage of voting stock.

The Investment Agreement did not give Trexs control over Eco Oro: whilst it required
Eco Oro to take all commercially reasonable steps to appoint a Trexs nominee to the Board
or, absent such appointment, to permit a Trexs nominee to attend board meetings as an
observer, this type of provision is commonly required by capital providers making equivalent
investments. Thus, whilst Trexs had a contractual right to have a candidate considered for
appointment to the board (and at the relevant time had a nominee appointed to the board)
such appointment was not guaranteed. In any event, the ability to appoint one member of a

six-person board does not equate to control.

With respect to the provisions of the Investment Agreement, Trexs’ veto rights are standard
negative covenants in corporate finance and, rather than an usurpation of control by Trexs,
they are an exercise of the powers granted to Eco Oro’s board of directors under the Articles
of Association. Again, the consultation rights and rights to receive information are not an
assertion of control but a standard feature of financing agreements. Indeed, it is noteworthy
that, having received the Trexs CVR, Colombia made no further submissions as to its giving
of control, no doubt on the basis that the actual text was not supportive of Colombia’s initial

submissions.

Eco Oro has substantial business activities in Canada. Whilst the words “substantial

business activities” are not defined in the FTA, it is typically interpreted by tribunals to

Articles of Incorporation of Eco Oro (5 May 2005) (Exhibit C-10).

require the investor-claimant to be more than a “shell company” with business activities that
are “nominal, passive, limited and insubstantial’*"? and that “substantial” refers to the

substance of the activity rather than its form.?!®

The purpose of the denial of benefits
provision is to ensure shell companies are not established and used to manufacture
jurisdiction. Eco Oro has maintained its place of business in Canada since 1987 and, in that
time, has bought and contracted for many services, including: mineral sample storage,
laboratory testing, assay analysis, metallurgical test and resource estimation. In addition, it
conducts corporate and commercial activities in Canada such as its finance and investor
relations, it trades its shares on a Canadian stock exchange, complies with Canadian security
filing obligations, raised equity funding, maintains active Canadian dollar denominated bank
accounts with the Bank of Montreal in Canada and holds its annual general meetings in
Canada. The fact its primary (or only) investment is outside Canada is irrelevant: it has
continuously had substantial business activities in Canada and has also carried out

exploration projects in Spain, Portugal, Brazil, Indonesia, the USA as well as Canada.?!°

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

As an initial point, the Tribunal notes that Colombia does not assert that Eco Oro is a
“free rider” or that it has made any attempt to treaty shop. It is not disputed that Eco Oro
has maintained business functions in Canada since 1987 (the issue being whether or not those
functions were substantial) and Colombia has from time to time acknowledged
both Eco Oro’s Canadian nationality and referred, in positive terms, to the existence and
importance of Eco Oro as a Canadian investor and to the importance of the Angostura Project

itself.

The Tribunal first turns to Colombia’s contention that Eco Oro is owned or controlled by
investors of anon-Party. The FTA does not refer to a majority or partial ownership, it simply
specifies ownership and it contains no definition. The ordinary meaning of “own”, when not
circumscribed by adjectives such as “partial” “shared” or “majority” connotes full or

complete ownership. The Tribunal therefore construes “own”, as used in the FTA, to require

Pac Rim, Decision on Jurisdictional Objections (1 June 2012) (Exhibit CL-118), para, 4.75.
Amto, Final Award (26 March 2008) (Exhibit CL-107), para. 69.
Claimant’s Rejoinder, para. 84.

111/387

252.

100% ownership. An investor with less than 100% ownership falls to be considered in the
second limb, namely whether they have the ability to exert control. Colombia has not
asserted that 100% of Eco Oro’s shares were, at the relevant date (8 December 2016) owned
by a non-Party and the Tribunal therefore finds that Colombia has not shown that Eco Oro

was owned by a non-Party.

Turning to the question of “control”, Colombia contends that the Tribunal should infer that
50% plus one shares were owned by investors of a non-Party given 49.61% of its
shareholding was owned just by three Delaware corporations and one Bermudan company.
Colombia says it is irrelevant whether or not such non-Party shareholders were acting in
concert as there is no such requirement in the FTA: Eco Oro was controlled by investors of

a non-Party.

It is not accepted by Eco Oro that 49.61% was owned by investors from a non-Party but, in
any event, turning to the express wording of the FTA, the requirement is for ‘control’. This
must mean, on an ordinary reading of the word, actual not putative control. It is insufficient
that if all the non-Canadian investors were to act in concert, they would be able to exercise
control. The Tribunal must make its decision on the basis of the facts - was Eco Oro
controlled by investors of a non-Party? Whilst it may be that Amber, Trexs, Paulson and
Harrington were acting in concert, even if they did collectively own 49.61%, this could not
result in control. Colombia has adduced no evidence that any of the other non-Canadian
shareholders were acting in concert, nor that there was any communication of any nature
between them. The Tribunal cannot plausibly proceed on the basis that it should infer control
in these circumstances. This is particularly so given the nature of Eco Oro’s governance
structure, which both requires shareholders to take decisions either by a simple majority or
a two-thirds majority and provides that a shareholder may only appoint a Director to Eco
Oro’s Board if such shareholder holds in excess of 50% of the voting stock (Colombia has

not adduced evidence to show any shareholder held that percentage on the relevant date).

112/387

253.

254.

There is further no provision in the Investment Agreement which evidences that Trexs was
able to, let alone did in fact, control Eco Oro (and the Tribunal notes that, having received
the CVRs, Colombia did not pursue its submissions that they gave the Participating

Shareholders control over Eco Oro).

Having determined that Eco Oro was neither owned nor controlled by investors of a non-
party on the relevant date, Colombia was not entitled to deny the benefits of Chapter Eight
to Eco Oro. It is therefore unnecessary to consider Colombia’s other submissions, but the
Tribunal notes that those business activities described by Eco Oro (and which activities
Colombia did not dispute took place) were sufficient to comprise substantial business
activities in Canada. The Tribunal does not see there is any requirement for Eco Oro to have
acquired a mining licence in Canada to meet this limb. It is further unnecessary for the
Tribunal to consider whether, to be effective, any notice should have been served on Eco
Oro notifying it of Colombia’s exercise of its right to deny Eco Oro the benefits under the

FTA nor by when such notice, if required, should have been exercised.

B. WHETHER ECO ORO IS A PROTECTED INVESTOR UNDER THE FTA

255.

Article 838 of the Treaty provides as follows:

“[...] investor of a Party means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or an
enterprise or national of a Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made
an investment. A natural person who is a dual citizen shall be deemed to be
exclusively a citizen of the State of his or her dominant and effective
citizenship. A natural person who is a citizen of a Party and a permanent
resident of the other Party shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the
Party of which he or she is a citizen.”>”°

Footnote 12 to Article 838 of the Treaty further provides that: “For greater certainty, it is understood that an
investor ‘seeks to make an investment’ only when the investor has taken concrete steps necessary to make said
investment, such as when the investor has duly filed an application for a permit or license required to make an
investment and has obtained the financing providing it with the funds to set up the investment.” Free Trade
Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into
force on 15 August 2011) (Exhibit C-22; see also Exhibit R-137).

 

 

113/387

(1) The Parties’ Positions
(a) The Respondent’s Position

. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae because the true beneficiary of the claim is
a Delaware-incorporated US company — Trexs — to whom Eco Oro assigned the benefit of

its claim in July 2016.77!

(i) Nationality under the FTA falls to be determined by reference to the true
beneficiary of the claim
. It is a well-established principle of international law that only a real party in interest has
standing to sue,” such that the nationality of a claimant falls to be determined by reference
to the beneficiary party and not the nominal claimant.>” Indeed, this principle is reinforced
by the provisions of Article 819 of the FTA which gives standing to a claimant to submit,
“on its own behalf,” a claim that it “has incurred loss or damage” arising from an
FTA breach. Therefore, it is not sufficient that Eco Oro is a Canadian incorporated company

if it does not stand to benefit from the claim.

. This principle is not overridden by the /ex specialis regime created by certain of the FTA’s
definitions. There is insufficient specificity in the FTA and Article 838 does not provide
that complying with the definitions of “investor” and “investment” is a sufficient rather than
just a necessary condition to establish a claimant’s standing to bring a claim. The FTA is
subject to and consistent with principles of international law on standing and there is no

clearly evinced intention that the contracting States intended to derogate from this.

. Whilst no case has yet considered the issue, commentators observe that where, prior to the
commencement of an arbitration, a funding arrangement is entered into which gives rise to

a de jure or de facto assignment of the benefits of a claim to an entity that does not satisfy

the nationality requirements, the tribunal will lack jurisdiction ratione personae as the
nationality requirement should be considered by reference to the funder’s nationality.>**
The fact there are no prior cases applying this principle to this fact pattern is immaterial as

third-party funding of this nature is of recent origin.

(ii) The FTA’s Nationality Requirement was to be satisfied at the date of the
Request for Arbitration
The FTA’s nationality requirement falls to be determined at the date of the submission of
the dispute to arbitration as that is when the agreement to arbitrate is formed both under the

FTA and international law. This was 8 December 2016.

a. The Nationality Requirement was not satisfied at the date of the
Request for Arbitration because Eco Oro had assigned its claim
to Trexs
As of 8 December 2016, Eco Oro had already assigned the benefit of its claim to Trexs
pursuant to the Investment Agreement which was “in substance and effect an assignment of
the benefit of the claim by which Trexs became its main beneficiary and the party in control

of it.7325

Trexs became the main beneficiary: not only was it granted 51% of the proceeds of the claim
(whereas Eco Oro only stood to benefit by 22.7% of the proceeds), it was also granted certain
rights enabling it to control the process of the claim. These include the ability to control all
material aspects of the claim, including the right to veto any settlement or termination of the
arbitration and the rights to appoint a member to the board of directors, to be provided with
relevant information concerning the claim and to be consulted in relation to filings and

certain steps in the arbitration.

In addition, the Investment Agreement itself recognised, by implication, that it was assigning

the claim to Trexs by virtue of one of the representations and warranties which provided that

266.

Eco Oro had not “other than pursuant to [the Investment Agreement] assigned all or any

portion of [its claims under the FTA].”°7°

Therefore, as at the date the arbitration was commenced, the actual beneficiary of the claim
was Trexs, a Delaware corporation. Accordingly, the FTA’s nationality requirement is

not satisfied.

(b) The Claimant’s Position
(i) Eco Oro is an “investor” with Canadian nationality as defined in Article
838 of the Treaty

327 it was

Eco Oro complies with the requirements of the FTA: as accepted by Colombia,
incorporated in accordance with the applicable laws of Canada and it is a qualifying investor
for protection under the FTA in accordance with the definitions of “investor of a Party” and

“enterprise.”***

That in itself is sufficient as the FTA only requires that an enterprise
(Eco Oro) be “constituted or organized” under the laws of Canada (which Eco Oro is) and
permits the submission of a claim to arbitration by any “investor” of one of the FTA’s
contracting parties. Colombia has failed to identify any other provision requiring the
application of additional criteria. The Treaty requirements are clear and precise and no
additional requirements need to be implied; giving effect to the FTA as /ex specialis is

consistent with rules of international law.

Colombia’s argument to the effect that there is an established rule of international law that
the beneficiary of a claim is the proper party to the claim such that the nationality of the
claimant falls to be decided by reference to the nationality of such beneficiary is both
illogical and misplaced: illogical because in the case of publicly traded entities there will
rarely be a single beneficiary of a claim as such entity will have several economic

stakeholders and the nationality of such stakeholders may change several times in any one

Respondent’s Memorial, para. 43; Investment Agreement, Section 13(s)(ii) (Exhibit R-1).

Respondent’s Memorial, para. 19.

Eco Oro notes it is a company constituted under Canadian law, therefore qualifying as an investor pursuant to
Article 801(1) of the FTA. As required by Article 821(2)(d) of the FTA it included copies of; (i) its Certificate
of Good Standing issued by the Registrar of Companies of the Province of British Columbia, Canada
(Annex B); and (ii) The Certificate of Existence and Legal Representation of Eco Oro’s branch [Sucursal] in
Colombia issued by the Chamber of Commerce of Bucaramanga (Annex C).

day; and misplaced because the nationality provisions in the FTA are /ex specialis. Tribunals
apply nationality criteria strictly; indeed, one of the commentators cited by Colombia notes
that “the nationality of the claimant would be unaffected by the fact that the proceeds of the
award may go directly to a third party.”*? Pursuant to international law, a corporation’s
nationality is established by its place of incorporation**’ and not by the ultimate destination

of the proceeds of any claim.

Colombia misstates and misapplies the principle and legal authorities upon which it seeks to
rely as each relates to the nationality of the beneficial owner of the underlying property the
subject of the dispute (i.e., the investment that gave rise to the dispute) and not the
beneficiary of the claim itself. It has not been disputed that Eco Oro has full legal title to

Concession 3452.

Accordingly, Eco Oro is an investor pursuant to the provisions of the FTA and thus has

standing to bring this arbitration.

(ii) Eco Oro has not assigned its claims to Trexs

Whilst irrelevant, Eco Oro has not assigned its claim to Trexs, it has merely granted an
economic interest in its proceeds which has no effect on its own nationality. Trexs is just
one of several equity and debt holders in Eco Oro and, as with other investors, it has
provided capital to help both Eco Oro’s business in Colombia as well as to finance the
arbitral proceedings. It is not a third-party funder, but even if it were, recent cases
concerning third-party funding have concluded that in the absence of express wording in the

relevant treaty to the contrary, tribunals should opt for “informed indifference” towards a

1

funder’s involvement with respect to the admissibility of the claim.**! In the present case,

“[t]ransfer of economic interest (or ‘beneficial interest’) to a funder of a different
nationality than the funded party before the initiation of the arbitral proceedings does not
affect jurisdiction, unless relevant investment treaty contains clear language to this effect.

271.

332

the FTA requires nothing more of Eco Oro than that it is an “entity constituted under the
laws of Canada” which it is. The FTA definitions are clear: there is therefore no justification

or necessity for the Tribunal to import any additional requirements into it.

It would be impractical and would “eviscerate the distinct legal personality that comes with

99332

the incorporation of a business if it were necessary to analyse how each stakeholder

stands to benefit from the proceeds of an arbitration in order to determine the nationality of
aclaimant-enterprise. It would also be contrary to the object and purpose of the FTA which
seeks to ensure a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment
if its qualification as an investor were to depend on the relative interests and priorities of its

stakeholders.

There is a legal distinction between an assignment of a claim (after which the claim can only
be brought by the assignee) and an investment into a publicly traded entity. The Investment
Agreement achieves what it says it is, namely an investment; assignment is not its practical
effect and Eco Oro is not a “facade.” The question of “control” is not relevant to the question
of Eco Oro’s status as an investor and Eco Oro has full control over the arbitration; no steps
can be taken without its consent. Trexs holds less than 10% of Eco Oro’s shares and the
majority of Eco Oro’s directors have no links with Trexs such that Trexs has no command

over Eco Oro’s decision-making process, including with respect to the arbitration. In any

That the claimant is a purely or partially nominal owner (and thus not the ‘real party in
interest’) otherwise has no bearing on the requirements of ‘investor’ and ‘investment.’

This position finds support in a constant line of case law: CSOB v. Slovakia, Saluka
Investments BV v. The Czech Republic, RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation and
Quasar de Valores v. The Russian Federation. The arbitral tribunals deciding these cases
took into account the presence of a third-party funder and, far from declining to ‘recognize
the role of third-party funders’, opted for informed indifference towards the funder’s
involvement as regards admissibility of the funded investor's claim. This indifference has
nothing to do with ‘ ignoring the elephant in the room’, but rather constitutes the logical

of of inves treaty language. In the absence of
clear treaty provisions to the contrar ry, the economic interest a funder obtains by virtue of
the funding agreement as well as the motives behind its investment are not relevant for
deciding on the legal question whether or not the funded party’s claim is admissible. This
is not only the correct legal approach, but also corresponds with business reality. It would
hardly make sense if, in a financially deeply interconnected world, ‘[a]nything short of full
and disclosed claim assignment to a third party might shed doubt on the identity of the actual
claimant.”

event, the directors all owe fiduciary duties to all the shareholders.** Finally, certain words
were omitted from the Investment Agreement provision quoted by Colombia: it should read
“other than pursuant to the Investment, [Eco Oro] has_not_disposed_of, transferred,
encumbered or assigned all or any portion of such Claim Proceedings (or any interest
therein) or any proceeds thereof, whether by way of security or otherwise (including any set
off or agreement to set off any amounts relating to the Claim Proceedings).” (The words
underlined are the words omitted by Colombia). When read in full, it is clear the purpose
and meaning of the provision is to confirm that Eco Oro has not and would not convey the
claim proceeds in any way. It does not infer that the Investment Agreement was in reality
an assignment. Indeed, Colombia cannot complain that Eco Oro was obliged to seek funding

as a direct result of Colombia’s own unlawful conduct.>*4

. The CVR which was appended as Schedule A to the Investment Agreement provides that it
“does not derogate from or in any way limit or restrict [Eco Oro’s] ownership of the Claim

Proceeding Rights and [Eco Oro’s] ability to prosecute the Claim Proceedings or otherwise

result in the Holder owning or controlling the Claim Proceedings.”>°

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

. It is not disputed that Eco Oro is incorporated in accordance with the applicable laws
of Canada and is a Canadian enterprise. Accordingly, Eco Oro satisfies the express
requirements set out in Article 838 of the FTA. The test in Article 838 is clear and specific:
the Tribunal does not accept Colombia’s contention that there is insufficient specificity in
the FTA. Colombia does not identify any provisions in the FTA requiring investigation into

Eco Oro’s beneficial ownership and the Tribunal does not accept Colombia’s further

119/387

contention that as there is no provision in the FTA specifying that this is the only applicable
test, the Tribunal must instead be guided by a principle of international law which requires
consideration of the beneficial owner of the putative claimant. In the absence of such
provisions, it is not apparent to the Tribunal why it should engage in an analysis of the
beneficial owners of a listed company. The cases cited by Colombia do not relate to the
beneficial owner of the claimant but to the beneficial ownership of the property the subject
of the claim. Whilst this may not always be a distinction with any substance, in the present
case, where there is no allegation (or evidence) that Eco Oro itself is not the 100% owner of
the title to Concession 3452, the Tribunal is satisfied that Eco Oro is a protected investor for

the purposes of Article 838 such that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione personae.

C. WHETHER ECO ORO HAS COMPLIED WITH THE CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO.
ARBITRATION PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 821 OF THE FTA

274. Article 821 of the Treaty (“Article 821”) provides as follows:

“Article 821: Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration

1. The disputing parties shall hold consultations and negotiations in an
attempt to settle a claim amicably before a disputing investor may
submit a claim to arbitration. Consultations shall be held within 30
days of the submission of the Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to
Arbitration under subparagraph 2(c), unless the disputing parties
otherwise agree. Consultations and negotiations may include the use of
non-binding, third-party procedures. The place of consultations shall
be the capital of the disputing Party, unless the disputing parties
otherwise agree.

2. A disputing investor may submit a claim to arbitration under Article 819
or Article 820 only if:

(a) the disputing investor and, where a claim is made under Article 820, the
enterprise, consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set
out in this Section;

(b) at least six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim;
(c) the disputing investor has delivered to the disputing Party a written notice
of its intent to submit a claim to arbitration (Notice of Intent) at least

six months prior to submitting the claim. The Notice of Intent shall
specify:

120/387

(i) the name and address of the disputing investor and, where a claim is made
under Article 820, the name and address of the enterprise,

(ii) the provisions of this Agreement alleged to have been breached and any
other relevant provisions,

(iii) the legal and the factual basis for the claim, including the measures at
issue, and

(iv) the relief sought and the approximate amount of damages claimed;

(d) the disputing investor has delivered evidence establishing that it is an
investor of the other Party with its Notice of Intent;

(e) in the case of a claim submitted under Article 819:

(i) not more than 39 months have elapsed from the date on which the disputing
investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the
alleged breach and knowledge that the disputing investor has incurred
loss or damage thereby, and

(ii) the disputing investor and, where the claim is for loss or damage to an
interest in an enterprise of the other Party that is a juridical person that
the disputing investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, the
enterprise, waive their right to initiate or continue before any
administrative tribunal or court under the law of either Party, or other
dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the
measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred
to in Article 819, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or
other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages,
before an administrative tribunal or court under the applicable law of
the disputing Party, provided that the action is brought for the sole
purpose of preserving the disputing investor's or the enterprise's rights
and interests during the pendency of the arbitration; and

(f) in the case of a claim submitted under Article 820:
(i) not more than 39 months have elapsed from the date on which the
enterprise first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of

the alleged breach and knowledge that the enterprise has incurred loss
or damage thereby, and

121/387

(ii) both the disputing investor and the enterprise waive their right to initiate
or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law
of either Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings
with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be
a breach referred to in Article 820, except for proceedings for
injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the
payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under
the applicable law of the disputing Party, provided that the action is
brought for the sole purpose of preserving the disputing investor’s or
the enterprise’s rights and interests during the pendency of the
arbitration.

3. A consent and waiver required by this Article shall be in the form provided
in Annex 821, shall be delivered to the disputing Party and shall be
included in the submission of a claim to arbitration. Where a disputing
Party has deprived a disputing investor of control of an enterprise, a
waiver from the enterprise under subparagraphs 2(e)(ii) or 2(f)(ii) shall
not be required.

4. An investor may submit a claim relating to taxation measures covered by
this Chapter to arbitration under this Section only if the taxation
authorities of the Parties fail to reach the joint determinations specified
in Article 2204 (Exceptions — Taxation) within six months of being
notified in accordance with those provisions.

5. An investor of a Party who is also a national of a non-Party may not initiate
or continue a proceeding under this Article if, as a national of the non-
Party, it submits or has submitted, directly or indirectly, an investment
claim with respect to the same measure or series of measures under any
agreement between the other Party and that non-Party.”*°

(1) The Parties’ Positions
(a) The Respondent’s Position

275. The Parties have not perfected their consent to submit the dispute to arbitration as Eco Oro
has failed to comply with four of the mandatory conditions precedent set forth in Article 821

and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction.

336 Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and
entered into force on 15 August 2011) (Exhibit C-22; see also Exhibit R-137), Art. 821.

276.

279.

(i) Consent to Arbitration under the FTA is conditioned on compliance with
the Conditions Precedent in Article 821
These requirements are conditions precedent and not mere formalities: pursuant to
Article 823(1) of the FTA, Eco Oro’s failure to comply with any of these conditions

precedent results in nullification of Colombia’s consent to arbitrate.

(ii) Eco Oro has Failed to Comply with Four of the Conditions Precedent
Listed in Article 821 of the FTA
a. Article 821(2)(c)(iii)
The Notice of Intent did not state all the legal and factual bases for its claim, including each
one of the measures at issue. The wording of the FTA is clear: it requires the Notice to
contain, inter alia, “the legal and the factual basis for the claim, including the measures at
issue.” This requires the listing of all the measures at issue, without limitation, to ensure
Colombia is properly apprised of the existence, scope and subject matter of the controversy.

It is insufficient for Eco Oro only to describe the “basis” of the claim in its Notice of Intent.

The cases cited by Eco Oro are irrelevant: none of the underlying Investment Treaties had
equivalent provisions requiring either the listing of all measures or alternatively conditioned
consent to arbitrate on compliance with such measures. Even if it were sufficient to describe
the basis of the dispute without specifying the entirety of the measures at issue, Eco Oro’s
Notice of Intent is still not acceptable because Colombia could not have understood from the
Notice of Intent that Eco Oro intended to bring claims with respect to measures that did not
concern the Angostura Project or the delimitation of the Santurban Paramo. Eco Oro is
seeking to introduce “by the back door” claims not related to the original dispute. To the
extent that claims were uncrystallized at the time the claim was submitted to arbitration,
Eco Oro should have waited before filing its Request for Arbitration and it should have filed
a new notice of intent to apprise Colombia of those new disputes which were not related to
the Angostura Project or the process of delimiting the Santurban Paramo. Accordingly,

Eco Oro failed to comply with the condition precedent in Article 821(2)(c)(iii).

Eco Oro’s reliance upon Article 46 of the ICSID Convention (“Article 46”) does not assist

it—a tribunal’s powers under Article 46 to hear incidental or additional claims apply only to

123/387

280.

281.

a dispute falling within the scope of the consent of the parties and as Eco Oro has failed to
comply with the conditions precedent contained in Article 821, there is no consent to submit

the dispute to arbitration and thus Article 46 is of no avail.

b. Article 821(2)(b)

Eco Oro failed to comply with the six-month cooling-off period. Eco Oro, in its Request for
Arbitration, refers to Resolution VSC 829, Resolution 48, Resolution VSC 906, Judgement
T-361, Order VSC 195 and Colombia’s decision to have the Colombian paramo declared
UNESCO World Heritage Sites as all being contrary to Colombia’s obligations under the
FTA. However, even on Eco Oro’s case, each of these measures was adopted less than six
months before Eco Oro submitted its claim to arbitration and they were mostly adopted after
the submission of the claim to arbitration. In particular, Eco Oro argues that it was deprived
of “vital rights under Concession 3452” by Resolution VSC 829, however that was only
adopted in August 2016. Thus, less than six months had passed between the date of the
measures giving rise to the claim and the date of submission of the claim to arbitration.
Again, this is a mandatory requirement which cannot be dispensed with. Whilst Eco Oro
relies upon the Crystallex case,>*’ Colombia notes that the relevant Canada-Venezuela BIT
did not contain an equivalent provision making the notice period a condition precedent.***

Therefore, Eco Oro failed to comply with the condition precedent in Article 821(2)(b).

c. Article 821(3)

Eco Oro failed to comply with the waiver requirements which are mandated to be in the form
of Annex 821 and included in the submission of a claim to arbitration. This waiver must
relate to measures that are alleged by Eco Oro to be in breach of the FTA and is submitted
with the Notice of Intent. Eco Oro’s waiver did not relate to all the measures alleged by
Eco Oro in this arbitration to be in breach as some occurred after the waiver and Notice of

Intent were submitted.*°

on 8 December 2016 and the mandatory cut-off date is therefore 8 September 2013 (the “cut-
off date”), however Eco Oro had knowledge of all relevant alleged breaches and the
resulting loss or damage before that date. The mining ban had been in force since Law 1382
came into effect on 9 February 2010 and Eco Oro has not had the right to mine in those areas

of its Concession overlapping with the Santurban Paramo since at least August 2012.

Eco Oro’s knowledge arises, inter alia, from the following which occurred before the cut-

off date (the “pre cut-off Measures”):

a. Law 1382 of 2010 which established an immediate mining ban in that area of
Concession 3452 which overlapped with the Santurban Paramo, being 54.42%
(confirmed by Resolutions VSC 2 and 4) and Eco Oro knew or ought to have known
that Concession 3452 was not protected by the transitional regime introduced.

Colombia refers to the following as evidencing that knowledge:

i. Anemail dated 24 April 2010” from Mr. Kesler (Eco Oro’s then President
and CEO) noting that Eco Oro was “Jed to believe that the Angostura project
would benefit from ‘grandfathering’ regarding the new law” which it
submits shows that the grandfathering exemption had not materialised for

Eco Oro;

ii, An internal memorandum dated 3 May 2010 which confirms that Eco Oro

knew it did not benefit from the transitional regime;*4!

iii. The rejection of its 2009 EIA pursuant to which Mr. Kessler noted in the
same email of 24 April 2010 that “[t]his effectively stops the project [...].

The project, with this condition, may not be feasible or economic.”;3”

125/387

iv. A report prepared by Mr. Kessler for Eco Oro’s board of directors noting

that the impact of this on the share price was “dramatic.”

Resolution 937 of 2010 confirmed Law 1382 was enforceable by reference to the

2007 Atlas;
Resolution 1015 of 2011 rejected Eco Oro’s EIA referring to Resolution 937;

Law 1450 of 2011 re-enacted the mining ban established in Law 1382 and
specified that the 2007 Atlas would serve as a “minimum reference” to enforce the
mining ban;

Resolution 35 of 2011 upheld the denial of an environmental licence; and

Resolution VSC 4 of 2012, which definitively confirmed Eco Oro could not
conduct mining activities in that part of Concession 3452 overlapping with the
paramo. As this was unchallenged by Eco Oro it took effect as a definitive
determination of Eco Oro’s rights under Concession 3452 through the application
of Laws 1382 and 1450. Thus, Eco Oro must have known VSC 4 curtailed its

ability to conduct mining activities in the paramo areas of Concession 3452.

284. Eco Oro sought to challenge these measures evidencing its awareness of them before the cut-

off date.

Those measures enacted after the cut-off date on which Eco Oro relies (the 2014-2019

Measures), do not give rise to a distinct, independent, self-standing cause of action; they

merely continued the prohibition on mining in paramo areas and so do not trigger the

limitation perios

Resolution 2090 did not increase or reduce the area of Concession 3452
overlapping with the Santurban Paramo vis-a-vis Resolution VSC 4, which had
been implemented before the cut-off date. Eco Oro is incorrect to say it benefitted

from the transitional regime as it neither held an environmental license nor an

equivalent environmental control and management document granted before
9 February 2010 as required by Article 5. The environmental managing plan Eco
Oro possessed referred to a smaller project in a smaller mining title and not the area

of Concession 3452 overlapping with the Santurban Paramo.

Resolution VSC 3 did not lift the suspension on mining activities imposed by VSC
4, it simply rejected Eco Oro’s request to extend the suspension of activities in the
exploration phase of Concession 3452 because the delimitation of the paramo

pursuant to Resolution 2090 had been issued by the time the request was rejected.

Law 1753 again confirmed the prohibition on mining activities in the paramo
ecosystem and again Eco Oro did not qualify for the transitional regime as it
neither had the requisite environmental licence nor environmental control and

management plan.

. Judgment C-35 was irrelevant to Eco Oro as it could not have benefitted from the

grandfathering exemption which the judgement struck down.

Resolution VSC 829 did not curtail any of Eco Oro’s rights because Eco Oro had
not been able to mine in the areas of its Concession overlapping with the Santurban
Paramo since at least August 2012 when the ANM refused to extend Eco Oro’s
exploration phase with regard to such overlapping area. It extended the exploration
phase only for areas that fell outside the Santurban Paramo and the ANM had taken

a substantially identical position in Resolution VSC 4.

The CIIPE minutes are irrelevant, merely confirming the existence of an

overlapping portion of the title.

Resolution VSC 906 rejected Eco Oro’s request to suspend its obligations under
Concession 3452 on the basis that Eco Oro’s alleged uncertainty about the effects
of Judgment C-35 were unfounded. The uncertainty alleged by Eco Oro related to
whether or not mining was prohibited in paramo ecosystems and thus in the parts
of Concession 3452 overlapping the Santurban Paramo. However, this uncertainty

existed before the cut-off date.

h. Judgement T-361 annulled Resolution 2090. However, the annulment did not alter
the ban on mining in the area delimited by the 2007 Atlas (being the “minimum
reference” area) and Resolution 2090 was ordered to remain in force until the new
delimitation was prepared, which new delimitation could not afford a lower level of
protection to the paramo than that provided by Resolution 2090. Again, therefore,

this judgment did not give rise to a self-standing cause of action.

i. Finally, Colombia’s application to UNESCO was a continuation of Colombia’s
legislature’s policy decision to ban mining in the paramos and did not give rise to

a self-standing cause of action.

In arguing that the Angostura Project survived notwithstanding the pre cut-off Measures,
Eco Oro contends that Colombia provided continued support for the Angostura Project after
the mining ban adopted in 2010 and that it was only the 2014 — 2019 Measures that destroyed

the Angostura Project. These submissions are not supported by the actual facts.

The Terms of Reference for the underground mining project did not indicate support for the
Angostura Project: they were accompanied by a letter from ANLA Director Ms. Sarmiento
noting the requirement to take into account the ongoing process of delimitation of the
Santurban Paéramo and further noting the adoption of the 2007 Atlas pursuant to
Resolution 2090.*#> It is correct that the letter referred to Decree No. 2820 of 5 August 2010
(“Decree 2820”),*“° but such reference was not an indication that mining was not banned in
the Santurban Paramo. Decree 2820 did not specifically regulate the granting of
environmental licences in paramo areas but instead provided a general framework for the
processing and issuance of environmental licenses in Colombia. Further, it required a
favourable opinion from the MinAmbiente as a precondition for the granting of an
environmental licence and required the subject project to comply with applicable instruments
for the conservation and sustainable use of the environment. The applicable instrument at
the time of Eco Oro’s request for Terms of Reference was Resolution 937 which meant that

the 2007 Atlas delimitation applied. Therefore, at this time (February 2012) Eco Oro should

have understood that it would not be able to mine in those areas overlapping with the

Santurban Paramo.

PIN and PINE designations were neither endorsements nor confirmation of the legal or
environmental feasibility of the Project; they merely streamlined certain administrative
processes or provided additional oversight and scrutiny to sensitive projects. Indeed, the
Project was designated a PINE because of its anticipated adverse environmental impact,

were it even to materialise.*"”

Surface canons were calculated with respect to the entire area of a mining title, not taking

into account mining exclusion zones.***

Whilst it was open to Eco Oro to request a
reconfiguration of the title to remove those areas where it could not conduct mining activities
(for example mining exclusion zones), it did not do so. The ANM was unable itself to
calculate the percentage of the area which did not overlap with the Santurban Paramo until
it received the polygon maps.*“? It would not have been possible for an ANM official to
determine the coordinates of the overlapping area in the absence of such a map as it would
have engaged such official’s personal responsibility. Eco Oro could have requested

reimbursement of the overpaid sums if it had requested a reconfiguration of the title.

It is also incorrect to say that Eco Oro’s rights were restored from the effects of the pre cut-
off Measures because it benefitted from grandfathering provisions: it had none.
The raison d’étre of Article 5 of Resolution 2090 was to grandfather projects at the
exploitation stage only. Eco Oro did not have the required documentation and so had not

progressed to the exploitation stage: the transition regime did not apply to it.

The mining ban continued in force notwithstanding Constitutional Court Judgement C-366
as Judgement C-366’s effect was expressly deferred by the court for two years. By the time
its effects came into force, Law 1450 had been enacted which again contained a ban on

mining in the paramo ecosystems. In the Consejo de Estado Advisory Opinion 2233 of

293.

294,

11 December 2014 (“Advisory Opinion 2233”) the Consejo de Estado explained that this
meant the mining ban had been continued without interruption since 9 February 2010.>°°
Indeed, it is telling that Eco Oro never took any steps towards preparing an EIA and PTO

for its underground mine.

Resolution VSC 3 did not lift the mining ban over the entirety of the Concession area
but merely confirmed Eco Oro could resume its activities pursuant to Resolution 2090.
As Eco Oro had no grandfathered rights under Article 5, the suspension of mining was only
lifted in relation to those areas that did not overlap the Santurban Paramo as delimited by the

2007 Atlas.

Finally, as the Santurban Paramo had already been delimited pursuant to Resolution 2090,
Law 1753 was irrelevant and, in any event, as the Project was not at the exploitation stage,

the transitional regime in Article 173 did not apply to Eco Oro.

It is incorrect for Eco Oro to say that its administrative challenges to the pre cut-off Measures
are irrelevant because these measures did not result in a permanent deprivation of its rights:
Laws 1382 and 1450 introduced a permanent definitive ban on mining in paramo ecosystems
that is continuing. It is irrelevant that the ban was enforced through a provisional
delimitation contained in the 2007 Atlas: Eco Oro could not reasonably have expected the
ban to have been lifted and, whether or not the measures resulted in a formal deprivation of
its Concession, the fact is that Eco Oro has been barred from conducting mining activities in
the overlapping portion of its Concession area since August 2012, whether the overlap is

defined with reference to the 2007 Atlas or Resolution 2090.

 

(iii) Colombia did not exacerbate the dispute following the submission of the
Claim to Arbitration

. Whilst Colombia denies that it took any steps which aggravated the dispute following

submission of the Notice of Intent, even were the allegation to be correct, no argument has
been raised, let alone identified by Eco Oro, which would support its contention that such

aggravation would exempt it from compliance with the Article 821 requirements.

Consejo de Estado Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (Exhibit R-135), p. 11.

130/387

296. Eco Oro has identified certain measures that post-date the Notice of Intent which it asserts

are “Related Measures” because they concern the same subject-matter of the dispute
notified in the Letter of Intent and over which, it says, the Tribunal has jurisdiction on the
basis they are “incidental” or “additional” claims relating to the same subject matter as that
described in the Notice of Intent. These Related Measures are not related to the measures
the subject of the Notice of Intent. The dispute described in the Notice of Intent was limited

to Colombia’s “unreasonable delay” in delimiting the Santurban Paramo and its “persistent
lack of clarity” regarding Eco Oro’s right to continue developing its mining project.
It neither concerned Resolution 48 (which related to another mining title) nor measures not
concerning the delimitation of the Santurban Paramo such as (i) the termination of the
exploration period and Eco Oro’s renunciation of Concession 3452; (ii) the ANM’s decision
to approve Minesa’s PTO; or (iii) the alleged delay in approving the transfer of certain of

Eco Oro’s titles not relating to the Angostura Project to Minesa.**!

297. In particular:

a. Resolution VSC 829 granted Eco Oro a two-year extension of the exploration
period of that part of Concession 3452 which did not overlap with the Preservation

Area of the Santurban Paramo and thus confirmed its definitive delimitation.

b. Resolution 48 did not contradict Resolution VSC 829 and thus did not create any
additional uncertainty.

c. By Resolution 906, the ANM rejected Eco Oro’s final request for a suspension of
its obligations under Concession 3452 and this decision was upheld by
Resolution 343. The ANM’s decision was reasonable and valid under Colombian
law and therefore did not violate Eco Oro’s rights.

d. Judgement T-361 did not have any impact on the 54% overlap of the paramo with

Concession 3452.

Respondent’s Reply, para. 104.

131/387

e. As for the UNESCO application, firstly Colombia has done nothing additional to
the announcement by the Attorney General and, in any event, Eco Oro has not

substantiated how this declaration would have impacted upon Concession 3452.

f. Finally, Eco Oro did not renunciate Concession 3452 due to actions by Colombia
but to avoid being in breach of its own obligations as it had failed to submit a PTO
within the three-month grace period granted by the ANM after the expiration of

Concession 3452’s exploration period.

298. Colombia therefore submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to judge such conduct.

(iv) Article 46 of the ICSID Convention does not empower the Tribunal to
adjudicate Eco Oro’s “related measures” claims
299. As Eco Oro failed to comply with the Article 821 requirements in relation to these
Related Measures, the Tribunal is not empowered under Article 46 ICSID Convention to

hear them as they are not within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

(b) The Claimant’s Position
(i) Eco Oro complied with all of the Treaty’s pre-arbitration formalities

300. The Parties’ consent to arbitrate extends to all measures relating to the subject matter of the
dispute, so long as any claim arising therefrom is made no later than the reply memorial.>*?
Colombia’s consent to submit its investment disputes with foreign investors is provided in
Article 822. The provisions in Article 822 are procedural requirements which were complied
with by Eco Oro prior to the submission of its claim to arbitration. Therefore, the FTA

requirements to submit the dispute to arbitration have been satisfied.

301. Eco Oro consented to submit the present dispute to arbitration in accordance with

Article 821.

Respondent’s Reply, paras. 103 et seq.

Claimant’s Rejoinder, para. 97, referring to Rule 40(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which provides as
follows: “An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the reply and a counter-claim
no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the
ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim
at a later stage in the proceeding.”

132/387

a. Article 821(2)(c)(iii)

302. All Colombia’s breaches the subject of Eco Oro’s claim are incidental to, and/or relate to the

same subject matter as, the claims notified in its Notice of Intent. In particular, the Notice of
Intent put Colombia on notice that (i) its claim concerned the impairment of Eco Oro’s
mining rights in relation to its Project within Concession 3452; (ii) it had a claim under
Article 805; and (iii) reserved its rights under Article 811. Pursuant to the wording of
Article 821(1)(c), the Notice of Intent is only required to specify the “basis” for the claim.
This cannot require comprehensively detailing “every feature or element” of the claim, let
alone future conduct relating to the claim which would be impossible to foresee at the time
of submitting the Notice of Intent. The purpose of this requirement is to apprise the State of
the subject-matter of the dispute, as Colombia itself accepts.*** Therefore, to satisfy the
requirement, Eco Oro need only provide Colombia with sufficient information as to the
subject-matter of the dispute, including the measures at issue.*** Nothing in the FTA
supports Colombia’s submission and it plainly cannot have been the intention of the drafters
that a claimant should be obliged to launch new arbitration proceedings for each post-Notice
of Intent measure, even if such measure is part and parcel of the same dispute. Indeed, by
the terms of footnote 8 to the FTA, the FTA itself recognises that disputes, even once notified
in the Notice of Intent, are not static such that administrative acts giving rise to a claim may
be reviewed, confirmed or modified. It would make no sense were a claimant to be required
to issue a new Notice of Intent each time such an administrative act was modified. Clearly,
any such later measure reflecting the evolution of the claim would form a part of the dispute
and fall within the scope of the Parties’ consent to arbitrate. Whilst Colombia argues that
the purpose is to exclude “premature or unripe” claims, it is simply unfeasible to expect an
investor to wait until its claims were ripe — how could it know if the dispute would be further

exacerbated? Indeed, postponing submission of a Notice of Intent would unnecessarily delay

justice and the resolution of a bona fide dispute which is itself prejudicial and would cause

procedural chaos. It is also unfeasible given the 39-month limitation period.

The Related Measures plainly concern the same subject-matter as the dispute (see below)

and the Tribunal is entitled to exercise jurisdiction over the Related Measures.

b. Article 821(2)(b)

. Eco Oro waited at least six months from Colombia’s first measures giving rise to the present

dispute before commencing arbitration. The purpose of a cooling-off period is to ensure that
the State is aware that a dispute has arisen in respect of a specific subject-matter. Colombia
cannot have been unaware of the subject-matter of the dispute given the content of Eco Oro’s
Notice of Intent. The cases relied upon by Colombia are of no assistance to Colombia.
Whilst the tribunal in Burlington Resources v. Ecuador declined to extend jurisdiction over
an alleged breach of which no notice had been given,**° Eco Oro gave notice of the existence
of an investment dispute under Articles 805 and 811, being the provisions relevant to its case
as finally pleaded, including the claim for Colombia’s failure to accord its investment a
minimum standard of treatment under Article 805. Eco Oro waited the requisite period after

filing its Notice of Intent before commencing its arbitration proceedings.

c. Article 821(3)

Eco Oro’s waiver is in compliance with Article 821 being in the precise form of a letter
containing the contents as set out in Annex 821 and it applies to the entire scope of the
dispute, including any future actions of Colombia as is clear from the wording that it applies
to State measures “that are alleged to be a breach” of the FTA. The measures that post-date
the Notice of Intent of which Eco Oro complains are closely related to the notified dispute.
In any event, this objection appears to have been abandoned by Colombia in its Reply

on Jurisdiction. °°”

d. Article 821(2)(e)(i)

Eco Oro waited more than nine months after delivering its Notice of Intent before

commencing arbitration.

At the time of commencing arbitration, not more than 39 months had elapsed since Eco Oro
first acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of (i) those breaches by Colombia that
form the subject of its claims in this arbitration and (ii) that it had incurred a loss resulting

from those breaches.

As a jurisdictional objection, this issue should be decided on a prima facie basis, this being
the “universal” approach when considering jurisdictional objections.*°* Eco Oro refers to
all the measures that were adopted by Colombia after 8 September 2013 and it does not
found its claim on measures that occurred before that date. The first measure Eco Oro
identifies as giving rise to a breach for which Eco Oro seeks recovery took place in 2014
which was within the 39-month time period. The events prior to this merely comprise years
of delay on the part of Colombia to delimit the Santurban Paramo, it was only the measures
which took place in 2014 and thereafter which resulted in a permanent deprivation of its

rights under Concession 3452 and the crystallisation of its losses.

In any event, Eco Oro had not been deprived of its mining rights as at the cut-off date.
The pre cut-off Measures did not result in a breach of the FTA and thus did not have the
effect of depriving Eco Oro of its Concession 3452 rights; they are merely part of the factual
context. Eco Oro refers to the events that took place before the cut-off date merely as
contextual factual background to its claim; these events have no impact on the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction.

310. The fact Eco Oro still had mining rights over the entire area of Concession 3452 at the cut-

359

361

off date is demonstrated by the following:

It had to pay surface canons over the entire area until July 2016, when the amount
payable by Eco Oro was reduced by the ANM pro rata to the area falling outside
the Preservation Zone of the Santurban Paramo. Indeed, it is noteworthy that
(i) Colombia has never offered to reimburse Eco Oro for the amounts allegedly
overpaid up to July 2016 and (ii) it was only in August 2016 that CIIPE concluded

that the overlapping area was neutralised by State measures.*°°

Law 1382 did not specifically prohibit mining activities in paramo areas: until the
paramo was designated in accordance with the requirements of Article 3
(i.e., geographically delimited by the Environmental Authority based on technical,

social and environmental studies) the mining restrictions could not take effect.

Order 1241 and Resolutions 1015 and 35 denied Eco Oro’s open pit mining project
not because of mining restrictions but due to its disapproval of certain aspects of
the open-pit project. Indeed, MinAmbiente confirmed at that time that it had not

declared an exclusion zone over the paramo ecosystems.*

Resolution 937 was illegal, as concluded by the MinMinas because it did not meet

the requirements set out in Laws 1382 and 1450.*°!

Law 1450 required the Minister of Environment to delimit paramo ecosystems on
a 1:25,000 scale based on technical, social and environmental studies and thus
could only come into effect when the further delimitation exercise had been
properly undertaken. The ANM did not impose a ban on Eco Oro pursuant to
Laws 1450 and 1382, it imposed a temporary suspension of mining activities in the

area of Concession 3452 overlapping the 2007 Atlas pending publication of the

Intersectoral Commission for Infrastructure and Strategic Projects (CIIPE) Minutes of Meeting No. 5
[CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT] (16 August 2016) (Exhibit C-397).

delimitation by MinAmbiente, at which point the suspension was lifted. There was

no permanent deprivation of Eco Oro’s mining rights under Concession 3452.

Resolution VSC 4 again imposed a temporary suspension “until the Ministry of
Environment [...] issues the final delimitation to a scale of 1:25,000">° not a
permanent exclusion. The suspension was lifted when Resolution 2090 released
the delimitation at a scale of 1:25,000 at which point, as Concession 3452 was
grandfathered, Eco Oro was permitted to undertake mining activities in the entire
area of Concession 3452. Therefore, there was no permanent impairment of its

rights.

In fact, Colombia continued to endorse and support the underground mining project
in Concession 3452. It provided Eco Oro with terms of reference for the EIA, it
twice nominated the Project and Concession 3452 as a PIN and it required Eco Oro

to pay canons over the entire surface area of Concession 3452.

Resolution 2090 was issued after the cut-off date and did not contain a final
delimitation of the Santurban Paramo. However, as the Project was grandfathered,
Resolution 2090 had limited effect, although it did curtail Eco Oro’s rights in
certain ways, for example by prohibiting the extension of the duration of
Concession 3452. Resolution VSC 3, issued very shortly after Resolution 2090,
lifted the mining suspension imposed by Resolution VSC 4 leaving Eco Oro free to

pursue its mining operations over the entire area of Concession 3452.

Law 1753 again contained grandfathering provisions such that Eco Oro remained

permitted to continue its mining operations.

311. Thus, the measures passed before the cut-off date were irrelevant and meaningless to

Eco Oro’s claim. It was only in 2016 that its rights under Concession 3452 became
imperilled when the grandfathering provisions in Law 1753 were struck down as
unconstitutional by Judgement C-35, although it was unclear whether the Constitutional
Court’s decision also applied to the grandfathering provisions in Resolution 2090. In August

2016, the ANM issued Resolution VSC 829 extending Concession 3453’s exploration phase

314.

only in respect of that part of Concession 3452 which did not overlap with the Preservation
Zone of the Resolution 2090 delimitation but this was with reference to Judgement C-35
(and not to the pre cut-off Measures). It was only at this point that Eco Oro lost its rights to

conduct mining activities in over 50% of its Concession.

The fact that Eco Oro made certain administrative challenges does not make Resolution 2090
and subsequent events a single continuous dispute arising from the pre cut-off Measures.
Such challenges went only to the scope or effect of the Government act in question. As such
measures did not permanently deprive Eco Oro of rights under Concession 3452, such
challenges are irrelevant. In any event, as the measures which were effected after the cut-
off date are separately actionable, pursuant to the decision in Berkowitz v. Costa Rica,*® the

Tribunal has jurisdiction over them.

Eco Oro has also complied with the requirements contained in Articles 25(1) and (2) of the

ICSID Convention as:

a. There is a legal dispute arising from Colombia’s breach of its obligations under

the FTA;

b. The dispute arises directly out of Eco Oro’s investments in Colombia, which
investments are qualifying investments for the purposes of the FTA and the

ICSID Convention;

c. The dispute has arisen between Colombia, an ICSID Contracting State and
Eco Oro, a national of Canada, an ICSID Contracting State; and

d. Colombia has consented to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration pursuant to
Article 823 and, by filing its Request for Arbitration, Eco Oro consented to submit

its dispute to ICSID arbitration in accordance with Articles 821 and 823.

Therefore, the Parties’ consent to submit the present dispute to arbitration was perfected on

8 December 2016.

(ii) The Related Measures

Colombia does not argue that Eco Oro’s Notice of Intent was deficient nor does it assert that
Eco Oro is claiming for any Government measures that pre-date its Notice of Intent and that
were not referenced therein. Colombia’s objections are based on the fact that Eco Oro’s

claim in the arbitration include the Related Measures which post-date the Notice of Intent.

These Related Measures all concern the same subject-matter as the dispute notified in the
Notice of Intent, namely the impairment of Eco Oro’s mining rights in relation to the
Angostura Project as a result of the delimitation of the Santurban Paramo as encapsulated in

the following paragraphs from the Notice of Intent:

“The dispute arises out of the Republic’s measures and omissions, which have
directly impacted the rights granted to Eco Oro for the exploration and
exploitation of the ‘Angostura’ gold mining project, located in the Soto Norte
region of the Department of Santander, within the Vetas-California gold
district, which Eco Oro has been developing since 1994 (the Angostura
Project). [....]

The measures and omissions that have affected Eco Oro include (but are not
limited to) the Republic’s unreasonable delay in specifying the boundaries of
the Santurban Paramo and whether they overlap with the Angostura Project,
as well as its persistent lack of clarity regarding Eco Oro’s right to continue
developing its mining project in light of further requirements which remain
undefined and, later, as a consequence of Decision C-035 [Sentencia C-035]
handed down by the Constitutional Court on 8 February 2016, which
extended the prohibition of mining activities in paramo areas.”>*
The Related Measures are thus a continuation of, exacerbation of, or otherwise related to the

same subject-matter of, the dispute that was notified in the Notice of Intent.

Where a State has exacerbated a dispute after the arbitration has been filed, tribunals have
routinely exercised jurisdiction over such later measures. To do otherwise would be
unnecessary and inefficient. Where there has been an evolution of the same dispute, rather
than two different disputes, given the link between the initial claim and the later measures,

the pre-arbitration formalities performed for the initial claim also cover the later measures.*°>

Colombia is incorrect to state that the Crystallex and other cases cited by Eco Oro are not on
point because the underlying treaties did not make such requirements “conditions precedent”
or require the notices of dispute to specify the “measures” at issue. Article XII(2) of the
underlying treaty in Crystallex provides that prior to filing a claim the investor must deliver
a notice “alleging that a measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting Party is in
breach of this Agreement.” Further, the language of the treaty evidences that submission of
a claim is conditional upon compliance with the relevant procedural requirements and
itis clear from the wording of the award that the tribunal considered the pre-arbitration
formalities to be mandatory. The same approach was adopted by the tribunals in
Eiser v. Spain,>© Enron y. Argentina,*®' Metalclad,*® Swisslion v. Macedonia,*® Teinver v.

Argentina,*” Tenaris v. Venezuela*”! and Ethyl v. Canada.*”

The approach followed by
each of the tribunals in these cases was to consider whether the subsequent acts referred to
related to a dispute that had already been notified. If so, it would be unreasonable and

inefficient to “require the dispute to be carved into multiple slices, with each new

Jove);

requiring an additional request for iations and a subseq request for

a separate additional arbitration.”*”> Colombia has not cited a single case making a contrary

finding.

319. Itis also of note that in Crystallex, the tribunal noted that if the State’s argument were correct

320.

374

375

it “would allow a state to continue to adopt new measures with a view to triggering new

notices and amicable settlement requirements.

9374

The relationship between the Related Measures and the subject matter of the Notice of Intent

can be seen as follows:

a.

Resolution VSC 829 justifies the refusal to extend the exploration phase of
Concession 3452 in relation to those areas of Concession 3452 which
overlapped with the Preservation Area of the 2090 Delimitation by reference to
Judgement C-35. Judgement C-35 and the 2090 delimitation are specifically
identified in the Notice of Intent and Resolution VSC 829 is therefore

unequivocally linked to the subject matter of the dispute.

Resolution 48 addresses the effects of Judgement C-35 and the 2090 delimitation
and whilst it concerns a different concession contract (Concession EJ-159 and not
Concession 3452), it indicates that the ANM was issuing conflicting decisions
exacerbating the uncertainty and lack of clarity described in Eco Oro’s Notice of
Intent regarding Concession 3452 and thus is again related to the subject matter.
The Tribunal is not asked to exercise any jurisdiction over Concession EJ-159, it is
simply referenced as part of the facts relevant to Eco Oro’s claims regarding

Concession 3452.

Colombia concedes that the ANM’s decision in Resolution 906 (and by association
the rejection in Resolution 343 of Eco Oro’s appeal of the decision) relate to the
subject matter, Resolution 906 having been described by Colombia as addressing

“the alleged uncertainty surrounding the delimitation of the Santurban Paramo.”>7>

By its content, Judgement T-361 created further uncertainty as to the scope of
Eco Oro’s mining rights under Concession 3452 and therefore is clearly related to

the subject matter of the dispute.

Respondent’s Reply, para. 102.

141/387

e. The Attorney General’s office, having initially deplored the legal uncertainty to
which the mining industry had been subjected through the delimitation process and
having urged the Government to respect existing and acquired mining rights so as
not to incur State liability, then contradicted itself by stating publicly that Colombia
intended to apply to UNESCO to have all its paramos formally declared World
Heritage Sites, to ensure mining operations were prohibited in these areas.
The Attorney General referred specifically to the Santurban Paramo, explaining the
objective was to prohibit mining in the delimited paramo areas without paying
compensation to existing mining title holders. Again, this is clearly related to the

subject-matter.

f. The letter ordering Eco Oro to submit a PTO for Concession 3452 within
30 days specifically addressed the ANM’s views regarding the effect of the
paramo re-delimitation on Eco Oro’s ability to proceed with its obligations.
Eco Oro’s letters of renunciation referenced the ongoing uncertainty relating to the
paramo delimitation and its effects on Concession 3452 since Resolution 2090.

Hence the rationale for the renunciation is thus again related to the subject-matter.

g. Eco Oro had no alternative but to renunciate Concession 3452 given the acts of
the ANM. Having taken contradictory positions in the latter half of 2018 with
respect to whether or not Eco Oro should have received an extension for the filing
of a PTO, on 14 February 2019 the ANM wrote to Eco Oro ordering it to submit a
PTO within 30 days, failing which the Concession would be subject to forfeiture.
Eco Oro would therefore be in breach of its obligations under the Concession
resulting in the initiation of caducity proceedings which would trigger cross
forfeiture of Eco Oro’s other titles and frustration of the pending assignment
of some of its titles to Minesa. It was not possible to prepare a PTO within the
very short period of time allowed and thus renunciation was a mitigation of

Eco Oro’s losses.

321. Article 46 of the ICSID Convention empowers the Tribunal to hear “incidental” and
“additional” claims “arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided they

are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction

142/387

322.

323.

376

of the Centre.” ICSID tribunals have consistently applied Article 46 as well as Rule 40(1)
of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to hear claims arising from State measures taken after an

investor’s notice of dispute or after the commencement of arbitral proceedings.*”°

Whilst Colombia says Article 46 is inapplicable because Eco Oro’s failure to comply with
the Article 821 requirements means there is no consent to arbitration, this argument is
circular and unsupported by the text of the FTA. The issue between the Parties is whether
the Parties’ scope of consent is limited exclusively to the measures listed in the Notice of
Intent, or whether it extends to measures exacerbating the dispute notified and which post-
date the Notice of Intent. Under Article 823, Colombia consented to having disputes
submitted to arbitration so long as the pre-arbitration formalities were complied with.
Once the dispute was submitted to ICSID, Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and
Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules gave the Tribunal jurisdiction to hear all claims

that arise from the subject matter of the dispute.

The cases cited by Colombia to support its argument are inapposite. The tribunal in
Guaracachi*” declined jurisdiction over the new claims as, inter alia, there was insufficient
nexus between the old and new claims and the new claims all pre-dated the notice of dispute
even though they were known to the claimant at the time the notice was issued. This is not
the position in the present case. Equally, the tribunal in Supervisién y Control S.A. v. Costa
Rica>”® refused jurisdiction over new claims that were not mentioned in the Notice of Intent,
nor “directly related to those included in the Notice of Intent” on the basis of non-compliance
with the notification requirement. However, claims that were directly linked were held to

be admissible.

The Tribunal should therefore exercise jurisdiction over the Related Measures.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis
(a) Article 821(2)(c)(iii)

Colombia’s first objection is the adequacy of Eco Oro’s Notice of Intent given its failure
expressly to list the Related Measures in breach of Article 821(2)(c)(iii). This provision
requires specification of “the legal and factual basis for the claim, including the measures
at issue.” Given the context of Article 821 as a whole and considering the ordinary meaning
of the provision, the purpose of this Article is to ensure the State is provided with sufficient
detail to enable it to engage in constructive and informed discussions with the investor to
enable a realistic possibility of achieving a settlement of the dispute before the arbitration is
commenced. It was therefore not necessary for Eco Oro to include extensive detail in its

Notice of Intent, provided “the measures at issue” were clear.

Colombia does not argue that Eco Oro wrongfully omitted relevant measures which took
place before the Notice of Intent was issued. It is difficult to see how Colombia could
reasonably expect Eco Oro to have identified measures that occurred after the date the Notice
of Intent was issued (the Tribunal considers below whether it has jurisdiction over the
Related Measures). The Notice of Intent identified that the harm suffered by Eco Oro arose
as a result of Colombia’s delays in delimiting the boundaries of the Santurban Paramo in
addition to the impact of Judgement C-35 in extending the boundaries of the mining ban. At
the time the Notice of Intent was issued, it provided clear and full details of the measures out
of which the dispute arose, namely the acts of Colombia specifically in relation to the
delimitation of the Santurban Paramo. Colombia cannot therefore reasonably argue that it
was not properly apprised of the existence, scope and subject-matter of the controversy at

the time the Notice of Intent was served.

It must also be borne in mind when considering the content and adequacy of the Notice of
Intent that Eco Oro had to keep at the forefront of its mind two specific time periods when
deciding when to file its Notice of Intent: the minimum six-month time limit in
Article 821(2)(b) and the 39-month limitation period contained in Article 821(2)(e)(i).

Eco Oro therefore had to judge the point in time at which its claim had crystallised but once

144/387

328.

329.

this point had been reached, it couldn’t wait for an indeterminate period of time to see if

Colombia effected any further measures exacerbating the dispute.

The Tribunal therefore turns to consider the Related Measures and specifically whether Eco
Oro’s inclusion of them in its submissions is bringing in “by the back-door’ claims which
were not included in the Notice of Intent. It is unclear whether Colombia says that the fact
that these form a part of Eco Oro’s case notwithstanding they were not referred to in the
Notice of Intent renders the Notice of Intent invalid or whether Colombia’s argument is that
the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Related Measures or both. As a preliminary point, it
cannot be the case that a claim becomes frozen in time once a Notice of Intent is filed. Just
because an investor takes the step of filing a Notice of Intent does not mean that a State will
automatically cease its activity in relation to the disputed property. Claims are not static and
Government action may continue in parallel with inter-party consultations and the progress
of arbitral proceedings. An investor must be entitled to continue to seek remedies in relation
to continuing activity which it asserts is (or may come to be) in breach of the relevant Treaty,
even after it has commenced arbitration, insofar as those breaches are related to claims set
out in the Notice of Intent. The alternative — to expect an investor to file a new Notice of
Intent each time a further measure occurs — is hardly realistic or practical, as it would result

in unnecessary waste of time and financial resources.

The Tribunal accepts that to the extent a measure is unrelated to the dispute but in relation
to which Eco Oro sought to make a claim, such a claim should clearly be the subject of a
new arbitration and the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction over such measure. However,
if there is a clear nexus between the measures detailed in the Notice of Intent and the Related
Measures then the Tribunal should be able to exercise its jurisdiction over the Related
Measures. The Tribunal therefore considers each of the Related Measures to ascertain
whether there is sufficient nexus between such measure and the claim as detailed in the
Notice of Intent such that it is an evolution of the same dispute and it would therefore be
inefficient to require repetition of the pre-arbitration formalities. In this regard, the Tribunal
notes that the Notice of Intent is a detailed document (comprising 14 pages) with the last

measure referred to being Judgement C-35.

145/387

330.

331.

332.

333.

334.

335.

336.

The first Related Measure is Resolution VSC 829. This resolution extended Eco Oro’s
Concession rights only in the area which did not overlap with the Santurban Paramo and,
unlike the other extensions, made no reference to any temporary nature of the exclusion zone
pending the publishing of a 1:25,000 scale delimitation. It refers to Judgement C-35 and
accordingly has a nexus to the subject matter of the dispute as referred to in the Notice of

Intent. The Tribunal therefore finds that it has jurisdiction over this measure.

Whilst Resolution 48 concerns a different concession contract, it again relates to the effects
of Judgement C-35 and the Resolution 2090 delimitation and is relevant to Eco Oro’s
statement in the Notice of Intent as to the lack of clarity surrounding the consequences of
both Judgement C-35 and the Resolution 2090 delimitation. The Tribunal notes Eco Oro’s
clarification that it is not asking the Tribunal to exercise any jurisdiction over Concession
EJ-159 but is simply referencing it as part of the facts relevant to its claims and the Tribunal
accepts that there is a sufficient nexus between it and Eco Oro’s claim as detailed in the

Notice of Intent.

Again, the Tribunal finds that Resolution 906 relates to the subject matter of the dispute as
detailed in the Notice of Intent having been issued to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the

delimitation of the Santurban Paramo.
Constitutional Court Judgement T-361 is clearly an evolution of, and related to, the dispute.

Given that the Attorney General’s office referred specifically to the Santurban Paramo and
explained the objective was to prohibit mining in the delimited paramo areas without
paying compensation to existing mining title holders, the Tribunal again finds that the

pronouncement is related to the subject- matter of the dispute.

The communications between Eco Oro and Colombia in relation to the requirement for
Eco Oro to submit a PTO for Concession 3452 and Eco Oro’s renunciation of its Concession
are the final act of this evolved dispute. As such, the Tribunal finds it has jurisdiction

over them.

In conclusion, the Related Measures are all sufficiently connected with the dispute as

described in the Notice of Intent such that they each form a part of the continued unravelling

146/387

337.

338.

339.

of Concession 3452. The Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction over them both pursuant to
Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and as forming a continuing part of the dispute described

in the Notice of Intent.

The Tribunal also finds that Eco Oro provided sufficient detail in its Notice of Intent such
that Colombia was able to understand the basis of the case that was to be brought against it.

Eco Oro therefore complied with its obligations under Article 821(2)(c)(iii).

(b) Article 821(2)(b)

The Tribunal next turns to Colombia’s second objection, namely that Eco Oro did not respect
the six-month cooling-off period. This objection is not persuasive. Eco Oro’s Notice of
Intent references Judgement C-35 as the final measure leading to the dispute. The date of
this Judgement was 8 February 2016 and more than six months elapsed before Eco Oro
commenced the arbitration. The fact the Related Measures occurred after this date and
indeed continued to arise during the course of the arbitration is irrelevant; it cannot have
been the intention of the drafters of the FTA that if there is a subsequent measure which
exacerbates the dispute, this obliges the investor to start new arbitral proceedings and
conversely it cannot be the case that a State could enable proceedings to be derailed by the
simple process of effecting a further Related Measure after a Notice of Intent is issued.
Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Eco Oro is in compliance with its obligations under
Article 821(2)(b). It should be noted that in coming to this determination with respect to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the Related Measures, the Tribunal makes no findings as to the

legal effect of any of these measures.

(©) Article 821(3)

It is unclear whether Colombia maintains its objection with respect to the alleged inadequacy
of Eco Oro’s waiver (if it does then it is with a notable lack of enthusiasm). The waiver
issued by Eco Oro followed almost word for word the text contained in Annex 821 and the
fact that it did not contain reference to the Related Measures is unsurprising given they only
came into being after commencement of the arbitration. Given this and given the Tribunal’s

determination that the Related Measures are an evolution of the same dispute as that

147/387

340.

341.

D.

342.

described in the waiver, it is clear that the waiver is not defective. The Tribunal therefore

finds that Eco Oro has complied with its obligations under Article 821(2)(e).

(d) Article 821(2)(e)(i)

Turning finally to Colombia’s limitation period objection under Article 821(2)(e)(i), it is
common ground that the date from when the time period starts to run is the date on which
Eco Oro obtained actual or constructive knowledge of the adoption of the measures the
subject of the claim and became aware that a breach of the FTA could cause loss or damage
to its investment. Eco Oro says it had mining rights over the entirety of Concession 3452 as
at 8 September 2013 and that it was the measures which occurred after that which deprived

it of these rights. It therefore does not rely on measures which took place before the cut-off

 

date; the only relevant measures for the purposes of the Tribunal’s analysis being those
which took place after the cut-off date. In these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot see how
Eco Oro could be said to have known (or had constructive knowledge) of events which had
yet to take place, notwithstanding Colombia’s allegations that these measures could hardly
have taken Eco Oro by surprise given the measures that had been effected prior to the cut-
off date. The fact that on Colombia’s analysis, Eco Oro should have anticipated such
measures is not sufficient to comprise actual or constructive knowledge of the specific post
cut-off date measures for the purposes of Article 821(2)(e)(i). The Tribunal therefore finds
that Eco Oro is not in breach of Article 821(2)(e)(i).

In undertaking this analysis, the Tribunal has not considered whether Eco Oro did indeed
have any mining rights as at the cut-off date which were capable of being expropriated; that

analysis is to be performed when considering the merits of Eco Oro’s claims.

Article 838 of the Treaty (“Article 838”) provides, inter alia, as follows:

“covered investment means, with respect to a Party, an investment in its
territory of an investor of the other Party existing[**°] on the date of entry
into force of this Agreement, as well as investments made or acquired
thereafier|.J”>*!

(1) The Parties’ Positions
(a) The Respondent’s Position

Eco Oro’s claims relate to the prohibition on mining in the paramo areas of Concession 3452
which has been in force since 2010. This is before the entry into force of the FTA on
15 August 2011 and the dispute between the Parties therefore arose before 15 August 2011.
The measures which took place after that date are all a continuation of the mining ban in

paramo areas which was enacted in 2010.

Eco Oro seeks to bring two claims against Colombia: (i) that Colombia unlawfully
expropriated its investments by depriving it of “the use and enjoyment of its right to mine
the Angostura Project under Concession 3452” and (ii) that Colombia denied Eco Oro fair
and equitable treatment because it failed to “abide by its commitments in Concession

Contract 3452 and the 2001 Mining Code, including the commitment to a stabilized legal

framework.”?*? However, Eco Oro never had the rights it asserts and, even had it had such

rights, they would have been curtailed by a series of laws and regulations prior to the FTA’s

entry into force in August 2011.

In considering this, Eco Oro may only rely on those facts and matters which arose after the
entry into force of the FTA; pursuant to Article 801(2) the Tribunal must disregard “any act
or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force
of this Agreement.” Eco Oro’s rights to mine must be assessed at the time the FTA entered
into force, however at this time Eco Oro’s mining rights had been curtailed both by the
declaration of the Santurban-Sisavita and the Santurban Natural Regional Parks and
by Resolution 937 which imposed the same mining restrictions on Eco Oro as did

Resolution 2090. The dispute between the Parties therefore arose in 2010.

Under international law a dispute arises when a “disagreement on a point of law or fact, a
conflict of legal views or of interest between two persons” occurs.** The Parties have been
in dispute as to Eco Oro’s rights to conduct mining activities in the Santurban Paramo since
at least April 2010, as evidenced by the following measures embodying Colombia’s policy
in relation to mining activities in the paramo ecosystems and which Eco Oro opposed,

namely:

a. Law 1382;

b. Concepto Técnico 594 of 15 April 2010 by which MinAmbiente determined that a

significant portion of Concession 3452 overlapped with the Santurban Paramo;

c. Order 1241 of 20 April 2010 by which MinAmbiente rejected Eco Oro’s EIA on
the basis that mining was prohibited in paramo ecosystems and that a significant

area of Concession 3452 overlapped with the Santurban Paramo;

d. Order 1859 of 27 May 2010 by which MinAmbiente determined that it would assess
the merits of Eco Oro’s EIA;

e. Resolution 937;
f. Resolution 1015;

g. Law 1450; and

h. Eco Oro’s EIA was rejected by MinAmbiente relying upon Law 1382 and which

rejection was upheld by Resolution 35.

It can be seen from this that Resolution 2090 was not an isolated measure but instead a
continuation of the mining ban established by Laws 1382 and 1450, both of which predated
the FTA’s entry into force. Whilst Law 1382 was struck down, the mining ban was re-
enacted through Law 1450 and Eco Oro did not benefit from the grandfathering regime in
Law 1382. Whilst environmental licenses could be issued for non-mining activities in the

paramo, mining activities were not permitted.

Eco Oro did not have grandfathered rights and so had no rights to be curtailed by Law 1382
and its rights were not curtailed by Law 1450 because the mining ban did not become

effective until the issuance of Resolution 2090.

Eco Oro’s argument that to assess its jurisdiction ratione temporis the Tribunal should only
look at the claims as framed by Eco Oro applying a prima facie test is wrong: an objective
test should be applied.*** The authorities Eco Oro relies upon to support its argument

are not of assistance as none relate to the question of ratione temporis but instead

ratione materiae,*** ratione personae,** or are otherwise inapplicable.**”

Eco Oro’s legitimate expectations must be derived from facts arising after the FTA’s entry
into force. However, in its submissions, Eco Oro says it formed legitimate expectations at
two points in time: (ij) when it originally acquired the mining titles which were
consolidated into Concession 3452; and (ii) when the titles were in fact consolidated.°***

These expectations are legally irrelevant and in any event must have ceased prior to the FTA

entering into force. As of 15 August 2011, Eco Oro could not legitimately have expected it
would be permitted to mine in the entirety of the area of Concession 3452 as by then (i) its
environmental licence application had been rejected due to the presence of the paramo
ecosystem in the project area and (ii) the mining ban in paramo areas had been enacted by
Laws 1382 and 1450. Pursuant to Article 801(2), legitimate expectations which arose and

ceased prior to the FTA coming into force must be disregarded.

(b) The Claimant’s Position

This objection was only advanced for the first time in Colombia’s Reply on Jurisdiction and
therefore should be excluded under Rule 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. In any event it

is wrong.**?

The Tribunal must determine Colombia’s jurisdictional objections on a prima facie basis,
this being the “universal” approach when considering jurisdictional objections.*°° Colombia
is wrong to say this only applies to the evaluation of objections ratione materiae. In the
commentary relied upon by Eco Oro, the author merely notes that the prima facie test was
used “Jess frequently” and since publication of this article, the prima facie test has been used

in a number of cases.*”!

As a threshold matter, the events raised by Colombia do not form the basis of Eco Oro’s
claims and are accordingly irrelevant for the purposes of determining jurisdiction. Colombia
says that prior to the entry into force of the FTA, Eco Oro’s rights had already been curtailed
by (i) the declaration of the Sisavita Regional Park; (ii) the declaration of the Santurban
Regional Park; and (iii) Resolution 937 which adopted the 2007 Atlas. Eco Oro’s rights

were not curtailed by any of these three events. The Sisavita Regional Park did not overlap
with the Angostura deposit at all and the Santurban Regional Park only overlapped with a
de minimis part of the Angostura deposit. The declarations of the two regional parks were
not relied upon by Colombia as being relevant to Colombia’s jurisdictional objections in its

submissions prior to its Reply and their creation is irrelevant to Eco Oro’s claim.

Colombia’s argument that any legitimate expectations Eco Oro may have had must have
ceased by the time the FTA entered into force is incorrect. The events referred to by
Colombia did not deprive Eco Oro of its rights and therefore cannot have had any negative
effect on Eco Oro’s legitimate expectations. As Eco Oro’s rights were only deprived by
events which took place after the FTA entered into force, its legitimate expectations arising

out of those rights could not have ceased to exist.

That should be the end of the investigation. If, however, Colombia’s argument needs to be
addressed in substance, it is clear that the real dispute between the Parties does not arise from

events prior to the cut-off date but from after the FTA came into force.

Thus, it was only events after the FTA entered into force that caused Eco Oro to suffer a
permanent loss and only those events which resulted in Eco Oro having knowledge of a

breach of the FTA causing it loss and therefore triggering the FTA time limitation.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Eco Oro says that in making its case it does not rely upon any acts or facts that arose before
the entry into force of the FTA, namely on 15 August 2011. It states that it relies only upon

those acts which took place thereafter.

Eco Oro further says its rights were only deprived by events which took place after the FTA
entered into force, such that its legitimate expectations arising out of those rights could not

have ceased to exist.

For the purposes of this jurisdictional objection, as Eco Oro relies only on post-15 August
2011 measures, that is sufficient to found jurisdiction over those measures: the Tribunal does

not have jurisdiction to determine whether prior acts are compatible with the FTA, although

153/387

it is entitled to have regard to those acts in establishing the facts as they occurred after
15 August 2011, including the state of mind of the Parties, and the expectations they may
have had at that time. Whether or not Eco Oro had protected rights will be considered below,
but on the basis that Eco Oro’s claim stands or falls on its reliance only upon facts and events

which occurred after 15 August 2011, the requirements of Article 801(2) are satisfied.

E. WHETHER ECO ORO’S CLAIMS FALL WITHIN THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION
RATIONE MATERIAE

361. Article 2201(3) of the Treaty (“Article 2201(3)”) provides as follows:

“Article 2201: General Exceptions
[..]

(3) For the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the
requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that
constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investment
or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade
or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent
a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary:

(a) To protect human, animal or plant life or health, which the Parties
understand to include environmental measures necessary to protect
human, animal or plant life and health;

(b) To ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not
inconsistent with this Agreement; or

(c) For the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural
resources.

154/387

(1) The Parties’ Positions
(a) The Respondent’s Position

(i) Colombia has not consented to arbitrate claims arising out of measures
which are expressly excluded from the scope of the FTA
. Colombia argues that Article 2201(3) of the FTA should be construed as providing that
nothing in the FTA is to be read as restricting the Contracting Parties’ ability to adopt
measures “necessary [t]o protect human, animal or plant life or health” and for “the
conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources”. On that basis, Colombia
asserts that it has not consented to arbitrate disputes relating to such measures, as Colombia’s
consent to arbitration set out in Article 823 of the FTA only extends to “claim[s] by an
investor of a Party that the other Party has breached [...] an obligation under Section A [of
the FTA]”. There can be no breach of the FTA if the actions taken by Colombia are (i)
necessary; (ii) do not constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination; and (iii) are not
disguised restrictions on international trade.*” Article 2201(3) does not solely apply to limit

a tribunal’s right to award non-monetary damages.**

Further, given environmental
measures were excluded from Chapter Eight in its entirety, it is not surprising that the more
specific exclusion provided for in Article 837 does not reference them and the fact Annex
811(b) confirms that measures for the “protection of the environment” do not constitute
indirect expropriation is equally unremarkable given their exclusion from the scope of
Chapter Eight. The Parties have not consented to resolve through arbitration claims
concerning measures that fall outside the scope of Chapter Eight and the Tribunal therefore

does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate on these measures.

. Support for this can be found in an opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union
(“CJEU”), stating that environmental exceptions in investment instruments act as a bar to

jurisdiction over claims concerning measures for the protection of the environment.*?>

Colombia further asserts that Article 2201(3) should be read consistently with GATT Article
XX which is phrased in very similar terms to Article 2210(3) and on which the Environment
Agreement and this carve-out are based. It is apposite to refer to GATT and WTO law in

interpreting Article 2201(3),*°° which support its construction.

Finally, Colombia posits that the second sentence in Article 2201(4) of the FTA does not
appear in either of the treaties giving rise to the disputes in Bear Creek**” (the Canada-Peru
FTA) and Infinito*** (the Canada-Costa Rica BIT), cited by Eco Oro in support of its
interpretation of Article 2201(3). Bear Creek and Infinito are thus clearly distinguishable on
this basis alone, and cannot inform the Tribunal’s interpretation of Article 2201(3), which
must be construed on its own terms, against the background of the other terms of the FTA,
and in light of its particular object and purpose and all other important principles of

international treaty interpretation.*”°

(ii) Eco Oro’s claims fall squarely within the Environmental Exception of the
FTA and therefore outside of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

The measures giving rise to Eco Oro’s claims are all measures falling within the FTA’s
environmental carve-out because they were all necessary for the protection of human, plant
and animal life, namely the paramo ecosystem and for the conservation of non-living
exhaustible natural resources, namely water. These measures have not been applied “in a
manner that constitutes arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination” as they apply to all holders
of mining rights located in areas which overlap the Santurban Paramo. Indeed, Colombia

notes that Eco Oro has not alleged discrimination.*°°

(b) The Claimant’s Position

(i) Article 2201(3) of the Treaty has no bearing on Eco Oro’s claims and
Colombia's interpretation is incorrect
Article 2201(3) provides that “nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a
Party from adopting or enforcing measures” taken for any of the listed purposes that meet
the qualifying criteria. The text of Article 2201(3) is explicit and specific: the ordinary
meaning is that it does not prevent the payment of compensation (which payment does not
prevent Colombia from adopting or enforcing measures to protect the environment) but only
applies when a State is seeking to pass (adopt) or implement (enforce), inter alia,

environmental measures.*”!

Indeed, the payment of compensation, as a result of an
internationally wrongful act such as a breach of the FTA, is a default rule under international
law.*” It is unnecessary for Article 2201(3) to state that this obligation remains in effect; to
the contrary, it would require explicit and unequivocal text to restrict a State’s obligation to

pay compensation.‘°

Again, applying the VCLT rules on treaty interpretation, Article 2201(3) specifically applies
to Chapter Eight. Article 834(2)(b) (in Chapter Eight) permits a tribunal to award restitution
but the act of restitution may require what Article 2201(3) expressly prohibits. It cannot be
correct that Article 2201(3) carves out environmental measures from the ambit of Chapter
Eight: if it had there would have been no need to refer to them in Chapter Eight at all.
For example, pursuant to Annex 811(2)(b), in “rare circumstances” environmental measures

will amount to an indirect expropriation. Had environmental measures been excluded from

See Claimant's Reply, fn. 1500, where Eco Oro asserts that “[a] similar provision appears at Article 1114 of
NAFTA. It has been interpreted as serving the purpose of a general reminder to be ‘sensitive to environmental
concerns.’ Metalclad Corporation v The United Mexican States (ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/97/1), Award,
30 August 2000, CL-15, para 98: ‘This conclusion is not affected by NAFTA Article 1114, which permits a
Party to ensure that investment activity is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns’; see
also SD Myers, Inc v The Government of Canada (UNCITRAL), Separate Opinion of Dr Bryan Schwart,
12 November 2000, CL-95, paras 117-118: ‘Commentators on NAFTA have referred variously to Articles like
1114 as ‘tautologies’ or as ‘diplomatic, rather than legal’ statements. [...] I view Article 1114 as
acknowledging and reminding interpreters of Chapter 11 (Investment) that the parties take both the
environment and open trade very seriously and that means should be found to reconcile these two objectives
and, if possible, to make them mutually supportive.”

  

See, e.g., Claimant’s Rejoinder, para. 208; Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 117, where Eco Oro makes
reference to Articles 27(b) and 36(1) of the ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally
Wrongful Acts (2001) (Exhibits CL-17 / CL-202 / RL-115).

Claimant’s Rejoinder, para. 208.

371.

Chapter Eight this provision would not have been included. Again Article 807(2) carves out
environmental measures, but had they been excluded in their entirety from Chapter Eight
this would have been unnecessary. In any event the second sentence of this article
specifically provides that an environmental measure will still be subject to the investment
protections offered in Articles 803 and 804 (guarantees of National Treatment and Most-

Favoured Nation Treatment): this is irreconcilable with Colombia’s asserted construction.

A further argument against Colombia’s construction is the absence in Article 837 of a
reference to environmental measures. Article 837 refers to those matters excluded from the
dispute settlement provisions of Chapter Eight as listed in Article 837, but environmental
measures are not included in the list and nor are measures falling within the ambit of
Article 2201(3). Colombia’s argument that the alleged general carve-out of environmental
measures contained in Article 2201(3) explains both the inclusion and exclusion of
references to environmental measures is contradictory. It is also noteworthy that Article
2202, which takes, in part, the same form as Article 2201(3) and which contains an exception

for national security, is explicitly referenced in the exceptions contained in Article 837.

This construction is supported both by the decisions in Bear Creek*4 and Infinito.*°°
The tribunal in Bear Creek considered an identical provision to Article 2201(3) holding that
it could not be interpreted in such a way as to absolve Peru of a liability to compensate the
investor for breach of a provision in the Canada-Peru FTA, stating that “since the exception

in Article 2201 does not offer any waiver from the obligation in Article 812 to compensate

for the expropriation, Respondent has also failed to explain why it was necessary for the

protection of human life not to offer compensation to Claimant for the derogation of Supreme

Decree 083.4

The CJEU authority referred to by Colombia is inapposite, (i) being contained in an opinion
relating to the compatibility of CETA with EU law and not arising out of adversarial

proceedings; and (ii) having been the product of teleological interpretation as opposed to the

textual analysis required by the VCLT. Colombia’s reference to decisions rendered pursuant
to GATT Article XX is equally inappropriate. GATT Article XX only applies to Chapters

Two to Seven and therefore cannot shed any light on the interpretation of Article 2201(3).4”

Article 2201(3) permits an investor to seek compensation but not restitution for a breach of
the FTA. As Eco Oro is not seeking restitution, only monetary compensation, Colombia is
not prevented from “adopting or enforcing” the measures at issue and Article 2201(3) has

no relevance to Eco Oro’s claim.

(2) Canada’s Non-Disputing Party Submission

In a non-disputing party submission dated 27 February 2020, Canada provided its views on
Article 2201(3). It noted that the general exceptions in sub paragraphs 1 — 3 are standard in
Canada’s trade agreements and the language used is generally similar across its agreements.
This enables States to “differentiate between investments on the basis of a broad range of
policy objectives without breaching the national treatment obligation” meaning that
“legitimate regulatory actions will rarely need to be justified on the basis of the general
exception on Article 2201(3) because they will not constitute breaches of the investment
obligations in the first place.” The general exceptions thus act as a “final ‘safety net’ to
protect the State’s exercise of regulatory powers in pursuit of the specific legitimate

objectives identified in the exceptions.”*°*

Canada notes that these exceptions only apply once there has been a determination that there
is a breach of a primary obligation in Chapter Eight. The exceptions in Article 2201 cannot
broaden the scope of a State’s primary obligations. For the exception to apply, the measure
in question must (i) not be applied in a manner that constitutes arbitrary or unjustifiable
discrimination between investments or between investors, or a disguised restriction on
international trade or investment; (ii) relate to one of the policy objectives set out in
paragraphs (a) — (c) (which includes the protection of the environment); and (iii) be

“necessary” to achieve these objectives. If the general exception applies, there can be no

violation of the FTA and thus no State liability and, consequently, payment of compensation

would not be required.

Canada further notes (in response to a question raised to the Parties by the Tribunal) that
each sub-paragraph of Article 2201 has its own scope of application and should be read and

construed without reference to any of the other sub-paragraphs.

Canada finally explains that the Contracting Parties to the FTA “did not view their investment
obligations as being at odds with the protection of environmental and social goals and their
environment and human rights obligations.” As provided for in Article 1701 of the FTA,
the Contracting Parties “affirmed that trade and environment policies are mutually
supportive” and that “a good faith interpretation of investment obligations in their context
and in light of the purpose and objective of the [FTA], will not be inconsistent with a State's
ability to adopt environmental protection measures. In this respect, in the context of an
allegation that a regulatory measure is in breach of Article 811, a proper analysis of the
measure in light of the guidance provided in Annex 811.2 (and if necessary under
Article 2210(3)) will not limit the State’s ability to regulate in the public interest for the

protection of the environment.”*?

In response, Eco Oro notes Canada’s acceptance that Article 2201(3) bears no
relation to the question of Colombia’s consent to arbitrate. This is a matter addressed in
Articles 818 — 837. Canada confirms Article 2201(3) only applies after determination of a
breach of a primary obligation in Chapter Eight; this presupposes that a tribunal constituted
under Chapter Eight will have had jurisdiction to hear claims based on, inter alia,
environmental measures. Given the exceptions listed in Article 837 and its Annex do not
include environmental measures, it is clear that Colombia has consented to arbitrate claims
arising out of environmental measures; there is no wholesale exclusion of environmental

measures from the scope of Chapter Eight.
Colombia concurs generally with Canada’s submission and notes the Tribunal should place

“significant weight” on it. Colombia further notes with approval Canada’s submission that

160/387

379.

380.

the Article 2201(3) exception operates as a “safety net” and that where it applies there is no
violation of the FTA and no liability to pay compensation, which submission, it says, is
irreconcilable with Eco Oro’s submission that Article 2210(3) only operates to prevent a
tribunal awarding non-monetary relief. This is a “highly persuasive” basis to depart from
the Bear Creek and Infinito judgements cited by Eco Oro (to the extent they are in any event
relevant). Article 2210(3) is clearly a “critical component” in the FTA scheme providing
for the balance between investment protection and environmental and human rights

obligations.

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal is here considering the relevance of Article 2201(3) in terms of Colombia’s

jurisdictional objection and not in terms of the merits of Eco Oro’s claim.

The Tribunal construes Article 2201(3) in accordance with its ordinary meaning pursuant to
the VCLT to consider its applicability to the question of jurisdiction. The title of this Article
is “General Exceptions” and Article 2201(3) commences with the words “For the purposes
of Chapter Eight [...].” Given these words, it is difficult to construe Article 2201(3) other
than as in principle being of application when Chapter Eight is engaged, rather than applying
to exclude the totality of the application of Chapter Eight. Had it been intended, as contended
for by Colombia, that environmental measures per se were entirely outside the scope of
Chapter Eight, the measures listed in Article 2201(3) would not be referred to as ‘exceptions’
to Chapter Eight; the words would be redundant. The fact that there is a detailed description
of the specific purpose and necessity of the environmental measures provided for in
Article 2201(3) (which list is a contained list and not just examples of measures that are to
be regarded as exceptions) is inconsistent with Colombia’s construction. Were it intended
that all forms of environmental measures are excluded from Chapter Eight, this level of detail
would also be redundant. The Tribunal’s analysis is supported by Canada’s submissions that
these exceptions only apply once there has been a determination that there is a breach of a

primary obligation in Chapter Eight.*!°

Accordingly, the Tribunal does not accept Colombia’s submissions that this provision can
operate as a bar to the existence or exercise of jurisdiction, and it therefore finds it has

jurisdiction ratione materiae.

SUBSTANTIVE CLAIMS

Having concluded that it has jurisdiction to determine Eco Oro’s claims, the Tribunal now

turns to consider the merits of its substantive claims.

The Claimant submits that Colombia has breached Article 811 of the Treaty (“Article 811”)
relating to expropriation, as well as multiple aspects of Article 805 of the Treaty
(“Article 805”) relating to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment
of aliens, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.

The Respondent denies having breached any provision of the Treaty.

A. ARTICLE 811 OF THE FTA AND EXPROPRIATION

384.

aul

Article 811 provides as follows:

“(1) Neither Party may nationalize or expropriate a covered
investment{*"'] either directly, or indirectly through measures{*"*] having
an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter
referred to as ‘expropriation’), except:

Pursuant to Article 838 (Definitions) of the FTA, “covered investment means, with respect to a Party, an
investment in its territory of an investor of the other Party existing on the date of entry into force of this
Agreement, as well as investments made or acquired thereafter.’ The same provision establishes that
“investment means: (a) an enterprise; (b) shares, stocks and other forms of equity participation in an
enterprise; (c) bonds, debentures and other debt instruments of an enterprise, but does not include a debt
instrument of a state enterprise; (d) a loan to an enterprise, but does not include a loan to a state enterprise;
(e) an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to a share in income or profits of the enterprise; (f) an
interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in the assets of that enterprise on dissolution;
(g) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic
activity in such territory, such as under (i) contracts involving the presence of an investor's property in the
territory of the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or (ii) contracts where
remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenues or profits of an enterprise; (h) intellectual
property rights; and (i) any other tangible or intangible property, moveable or immoveable property, and
related property rights acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other
business purposes.”

Pursuant to Article 106 (Definitions of General Application) of the FTA, “measure includes any law,
regulation, procedure, requirement or practice.”

for a public purpose; [47]
in a non-discriminatory manner;

on prompt, adequate, and effective compensation in accordance with
paragraphs 2 to 4; and

in accordance with due process of law.

Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the
expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took
place (‘date of expropriation’), and shall not reflect any change in
value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known
earlier. To determine fair market value a Tribunal shall use appropriate
valuation criteria, which may include going concern value, asset value
including the declared tax value of tangible property, and other
criteria.

Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable
and freely transferable. Compensation shall be payable in a freely
convertible currency and shall include interest at a commercially
reasonable rate for that currency from the date of expropriation until
the date of payment.

The investor affected shall have a right under the law of the
expropriating Party, to prompt review of its case and of the valuation
of its investment by a judicial or other independent authority of that
Party in accordance with the principles set out in this Article.

This Article shall not apply to the issuance of compulsory licenses
granted in relation to intellectual property rights, or to the revocation,
limitation or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that
such issuance, revocation, limitation or creation is consistent with the
WTO Agreement.”*!*

Annex 811 of the Treaty (“Annex 811”) provides as follows:

“The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:

Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and
entered into force on 15 August 2011) (Exhibit C-22; see also Exhibit R-137). Footnote 7 to Article 811 of
the FTA provides that “[t]he term ‘public purpose’ is a concept of public international law and shall be
interpreted in accordance with international law. Domestic law may express this or similar concepts using

different terms, such as ‘social interest’, ‘public necessity’ or ‘public use.”

Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and

entered into force on 15 August 2011) (Exhibit C-22; see also Exhibit R-137), Art. 811.

163/387

(1) Paragraph 1 of Article 811 addresses two situations. The first situation
is direct expropriation, where an investment is nationalized or
otherwise directly expropriated as provided for under international
law.

(2) The second situation is indirect expropriation, which results from a
measure or series of measures of a Party that have an effect equivalent
to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright
seizure.

(a) The determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a
Party constitute an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-
based inquiry that considers, among other factors:

(i) _ the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the
sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Party has an adverse
effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an
indirect expropriation has occurred,

(ii) _ the extent to which the measure or series of measures interfere with
distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and

(iii) the character of the measure or series of measures;

(b) Except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or series of
measures is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be
reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith, non-
discriminatory measures by a Party that are designed and applied to
protect legitimate public welfare objectives, for example health, safety
and the protection of the environment, do not constitute indirect
expropriation.”4!>

386. For ease of reference, in considering the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal includes such
detail as it finds helpful with respect to the facts contended for by each Party, the relevant
laws and each Party’s contentions to the meaning and effect of each such law,
notwithstanding that there may be some repetition of facts previously covered in the Factual

Background section (section IV above).

387. The Tribunal first considers the nature of Eco Oro’s covered investment.

entered into force on 15 August 2011) (Exhibit C-22; see also Exhibit R-137).

B. Eco ORO’S COVERED INVESTMENT

(1) The Parties’ Positions
(a) The Claimant’s Position

As at December 2014, Eco Oro’s Treaty-protected rights arising out of Concession 3452 and
its regulatory framework consisted of: (i) the exclusive right to explore and exploit mineral
resources in the entirety of the Concession area;*'° (ii) the right to a stabilised mining legal
framework such that only those new, more favourable mining laws enacted after the
execution of Concession 3452 in February 2007 would apply to its Concession;*!” and
(iii) the right to renew the Concession for an additional 30 years upon fulfilling the requisite

conditions.*!*

These rights initially arose out of Permit 3452. From 1997, Eco Oro carried out its mining
activities in the area covered by Permit 3452 pursuant to an approved PMA.*!° Permit 3452
and Eco Oro’s subsequent titles were granted under the 1988 Mining Code,*”° which
required a concessionaire to obtain an exploration licence and complete its exploration
activities before obtaining an exploitation licence. Pursuant to Article 6 of the 1988 Mining
Code, permits granted prior to the 1998 Mining Code (such as Permit 3452) and exploration
and exploitation licences issued pursuant to the 1988 Mining Code constituted acquired
rights. Article 10 of the 1988 Mining Code provided that mining activities could be

carried out anywhere in Colombia, save for the restricted mining zones, which included

Concession Contract No. 3452 (8 February 2007) (Exhibits C-16 / MR-34), Clause 4. Whilst in opening
submissions, Mr. Blackaby appeared to concede that Eco Oro only had an acquired right to apply for an
environmental licence and not an acquired right to exploit subject to obtaining an environmental licence
(Tr. Day | (Mr. Blackaby), 31:6-7), in paragraph 3 of its Post-Hearing Brief, Eco Oro maintains its submission
that it had valuable rights to exploit, which exploitation rights were expropriated by Colombia.

By signing Concession Contract 3452, Eco Oro gained access to Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code —
Law No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (Exhibit C-8).

Concession Contract No. 3452 (8 February 2007) (Exhibits C-16 / MR-34); Article 77 of the 2001 Mining

provided that:

“The Ministry may indicate areas in which prospecting, exploration or

studies, since these are incompatible with such works pursuant to the
Renewable Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Code [...].

The indication referred to in the previous paragraph does not affect
previously issued titles, while they remain valid.”

424

of the licences obtained (granted pursuant to the 1988 Mining Code) were converted into

exploitation licences shortly after being acquired by Eco Oro.
within a prohibited area and therefore Eco Oro had acquired rights to explore and exploit
pursuant to Permit 3452 and its other exploration and exploitation licences over 92% of the

Angostura deposit.

Article 6 of the 1988 Mining Code established what constituted acquired rights for the
purposes of mining laws and regulations (namely duly executed and formalised concession
contracts) and noted the difference between such acquired rights and mere expectations.*”?
Thus, when the titles were consolidated under Article 101 of the 2001 Mining Code into
Concession 3452, this gave Eco Oro acquired rights pursuant to Article 6 of the 1988 Mining
Code. Eco Oro’s single unified title granted it the right (and obligation) to explore and
exploit the entirety of the Concession area for up to 30 years and to obtain an extension of
423

the Concession. Whilst seven of the ten titles were under exploitation at the time of

integration, it is accepted that when Concession 3452 was granted, it reverted to being in the

4

exploration phase.*”* However, on being granted the unified title, the ANM approved

Eco Oro’s Unified Exploration and Exploitation Program, confirming it had fully complied

with the obligations set out in the various integrated titles. Eco Oro’s Concession 3452 had

Exploration Licences 13356 and 47-68. See Greystar Resources Ltd., Consolidated Financial Statements for

a duration of 20 years because the ANM deducted the ten years of exploration that had been

conducted under the oldest integrated title, namely Permit 3452.

Concession 3452 was a new contract and subject to a new legal regime but it was not a new
title: the concessionaire was entitled to assume that mining would continue to be allowed as
it had been allowed under the old regime.*”> Although Concession 3452 was only registered

on 9 August 2007, it came into effect on 8 February 2007 when it was executed.*?°
Eco Oro’s rights pursuant to Concession 3452, included the following:

a. To explore (clause 4(a)), which right entailed two reciprocal obligations on Eco Oro
(i) to pay surface canons over the entire area and (ii) the obligation to explore.
Eco Oro further had the right and obligation to apply for an environmental licence
by submitting a PTO for approval of the mining authority and an EIA for the
approval of the environment authority, prior to the expiry of the exploration phase.
Upon being granted an environmental licence, Eco Oro was then permitted to

commence exploitation activities;
b. The exclusive right to exploit in the concession area (clause 4(b));
c. The right to request an extension of the concession.

Eco Oro’s right to undertake exploitation activities in the whole of Concession 3452 is an
acquired right. Pursuant to Articles 58 and 197 of the 2001 Mining Code, Eco Oro had
acquired rights under Concession 3452 to explore, to exploit (provided the relevant
environmental regulations were complied with) and to obtain an extension of the
Concession. This is confirmed by (i) an opinion of MinMinas in 2012;*?" (ii) the Consejo

428

de Estado in a 2017 judgement;*** and (iii) by Clause One of Concession 3452 which stated

that the object of the agreement was “to undertake a project of economic exploitation [...]

in the entire area set out in Clause Two of this agreement [...]°*?

The fact that Eco Oro had to fulfil certain requirements (pre-conditions) before being able to
exercise its exploitation rights (such as obtaining approval of its PMA and getting an
environmental licence) does not change the fact these rights are acquired rights and not
condition precedents. This is demonstrated, inter alia, by the 2005 MinAmbiente Decree
governing the granting of licences (“the granting of an environmental licence is the pre-

””)430 and as stated ina letter

condition for the exercise of rights arising from [...] concessions
from MinAmbiente to the Consejo de Estado dated 7 October 2014.*!_ Thus, Concession
3452 gave Eco Oro acquired rights, the exercise of which was subject to obtaining the
relevant approvals, permits and licences. This became part of Eco Oro’s patrimony and thus
subject to legal protection. Eco Oro’s application for an environmental licence was entitled

to be considered as if there was no blanket ban on mining.

For Eco Oro’s right to exploit to be subject to a condition precedent (a suspensive condition)
as argued by Colombia, it would have had to have been expressly agreed to by both Parties.
The provision in Concession 3452 that Eco Oro had to apply for an environmental licence
was not a condition precedent but a legal requirement to be complied with to exercise a right
under the Concession. There are many such requirements, for example the various permits
and authorisations required for exploration activities as provided for in Article 198 of the
2001 Mining Code. This is clear from reading Articles 59, 197 and 199 of the 2001 Mining

Code which refer to the exercise of a right.

In compliance with these rights and obligations, Eco Oro has invested over USD 250 million,
over the course of 20 years, building: roads; over 1,000 drilling platforms from which it has
drilled over 362 kilometres of cores; several kilometres of exploration tunnels to expand the

existing network of tunnels that had existed when it acquired the underlying titles; and a

water treatment plant to treat the water draining from these tunnels. It has also declared over

3.2 million ounces of resources. *”

Pursuant to Article 45 of the 2001 Mining Code, Eco Oro carried these activities out and
incurred expense at its own technical and economic risk; not at its own legal risk.
The concession contract is an adhesion contact, established by the administrator. It is also a
reciprocal State contract (as defined by Article 1498 of the Civil Code) and, as confirmed by
Colombian jurisprudence, it is not aleatory.** Its purpose is to provide clear and firm legal
stability to those private parties that participate in exploration and exploitation activities,
conferring rights and obligations, such that the applicable legal rules are those in force at the
time the contract is perfected. Whilst it is accepted that certain subsequent public interest
laws, for example environmental laws, may adversely affect such a contract pursuant to the
principle that the public interest prevails over private interests, given the rights are acquired,
compensation is payable if the rights are adversely affected.*+*+ Article 90 of the Constitution
provides that for the State to be liable to pay compensation, there are three requirements:
(i) the existence of harm; (ii) the harm must be attributable to the State through either an
action or omission by any public authority; and (iii) such harm must be unlawful.
The compensable loss includes economic and non-economic losses, including loss of a

chance; the valuation is governed by the principles of full reparation and equity.

Were Colombia’s construction correct, it would entail Eco Oro renouncing its right both to
compensation and to the re-establishment of the economic equilibrium of the concession.
This would be impermissible under Colombian jurisprudence and doctrine as it would distort
the commutative nature of the concession contract. Because these are reciprocal contracts,

the only risks that can be validly transferred to the concessionaire are the economic risks of

the project, never legal or regulatory risks.**>

(b) The Respondent’s Position

Eco Oro did not have an exclusive right to explore and exploit mineral resources in the
entirety of the concession area arising out of Concession 3452. Its only right was the right
to explore for minerals and to apply, within strict time limits, for the necessary permissions
and licenses to construct mining infrastructure and exploit minerals, subject always to

compliance with applicable licensing restrictions and other relevant laws.

Eco Oro identifies its covered investment as being those rights arising out of
Concession 3452 and the regulatory framework and asserts that these rights were
expropriated. Whilst Permit 3452 was an exploration and exploitation permit, it only
covered 250 hectares out of Concession 3452’s 5,000 hectares and all exploitation activities
had been discontinued prior to Eco Oro’s acquisition of it. Eco Oro had no acquired rights
at the time of executing Concession 3452 to mine in the entirety of Concession 3452 or at
all. All rights, including any exploitation rights it may have had under the 1988 Mining
Code and Decree 2477 of 1986, were voluntarily relinquished upon its entry into Concession
3452, when its rights instead became subject to the 2001 Mining Code.**° Only mining titles
governed by the 2001 Mining Code, or those in respect of which a conversion request to the
2001 Mining Code had been made, could be integrated. Therefore, upon integration of the
ten titles pursuant to Article 349 of the 2001 Mining Code, all ten titles became subject to

the same unified, modern, legal framework.**”

In any event, the pre-2001 Mining Code titles did not confer any mining rights, the titles
being licenses and permits and not concession contracts. Professor Ricaurte accepts that
licenses and permits could be unilaterally modified by the Mining Authority without the
concessionaire’s consent.** Being titulus precarious, they could be altered or withdrawn at

any time without compensation being payable and their term was strictly limited with no

inadecuada distribucién de los riesgos, eventual crisis de los contratos” (2000), 11 Revista de Derecho Publico,

right of renewal. The fact that INGEOMINAS was aware that some exploitation had been
carried out under Permit 3452 is irrelevant, the entire Angostura Project was legally reset

upon integration of all the titles.4°°

Whilst Eco Oro is correct that concession contracts under the 2001 Mining Code are,

440 and as such can be

inter alia, bilateral and adhesion contracts, they are onerous contracts
aleatory or commutative. Colombian doctrine has held that concession contracts may be
aleatory because the parties are subject to a contingency of profit or loss.*4! This
contingency can be seen from Article 45 of the 2001 Mining Code, which provides that the
concessionaire carries out the concession contract at its own expense and risk. Therefore,

Concession 3452 is not commutative.

Professor Ricaurte is also incorrect to say that the principle of economic equilibrium applies
to mining concession contracts; such concession contracts are governed by the 2001 Mining
Code and not, pursuant to Article 53 of the 2001 Mining Code, by the General Public

Procurement Code.

. Concession contracts are multi-tiered agreements (contratos escalonados) such that the

rights and obligations accruing to the concession holder change over the course of each phase

of the concession.”

Not every contractual right is an acquired right; to qualify as such the
right must (i) have been perfected such that all requirements or pre-conditions to the vesting
of the right have been fully satisfied; and (ii) not be revocable. Whilst the object and ultimate
purpose of a concession contract is economic exploitation, its achievement is subject to
compliance with the stipulated laws and regulations and Clause 1 of Concession 3452 does
not provide that the right to exploit is an acquired right. The main purpose of the exploration
phase was to allow Eco Oro to conduct such activities as would enable it to submit its PTO

for approval from the relevant mining authority and apply for an environmental licence, but

there was no guarantee those applications would be successful. It is clear from the text of
Clause One that the PTO, once submitted and approved, forms a part of the concession
contract and defines the content of the object of the concession contract. Any application
for an environmental licence for activities which failed to offset their effects on the
environment must be rejected and the precautionary principle militates against issuing an
environmental licence for activities whose effects on the environment are uncertain. In any
event, an environmental licence can be revoked at any time without compensation if the
relevant environmental authority finds that the project causes an adverse impact on the
environment. A PTO may also be denied if it is not demonstrated that the project will be

technically or economically feasible.

. To acquire the right to exploit minerals under Concession 3452, pursuant to Articles 85

and 86 of the 2001 Mining Code and Clauses 5 and 6 of Concession 3452, Eco Oro had to,
inter alia, submit a viable PTO and obtain an environmental licence,‘** neither of which it
did for the underground mining project (and its attempt to obtain an environmental licence
for the open-pit mining project failed): in the absence of these, there is no right to carry out
construction or exploitation activities. These requirements are suspensive conditions to
which the existence of the right to fulfilment is subject; there is no right to exploit without
satisfying them and as they are attached to the rights to construct and exploit, these rights
cannot be acquired rights but are merely bare expectations which were not immune to
subsequent changes in the laws and regulations. This is clear from the Civil Code which
provides that: “4 condition is suspensive if, while it is not fulfilled, the acquisition of a right
is suspended, it is resolutive if a right is extinguished when it is fulfilled." This is also
confirmed by a Judgement of the Constitutional Court.4> Contrary to a bare expectation
(simples expectativas), an acquired right can be transferred to a third party and is immune to
subsequent laws or regulations. A right that is subject to a suspensive condition is deemed

not even to exist until the condition is met.*#°

As these conditions have not been satisfied, the right to exploit has not been perfected and

so cannot be an acquired right.

Whilst Mr. De Vivero accepted in his oral testimony that the right to explore was an acquired
right, even though to exercise this right required the obtention of permits and licences, he
further testified that the same did not apply to exploitation. In the exploration phase, the
entirety of the area is available to the concessionaire to carry out certain activities and that
is the acquired right — it is correct that to exercise certain aspects of that right, permits or
authorisations may be required, to enable trees to be cut down or to use water for example,
but the whole of the concession area is available and accessible. At the exploitation phase,
the concessionaire has no accessibility to any part of the concession area unless and until
they get the environmental licence. This environmental licence is completely different to
an environmental authorisation and without it there is no access at all to any area of

the concession.

Upon being asked by MinAmbiente to clarify the nature of the exploitation right,**”

the Consejo de Estado confirmed these rights were not acquired rights.*#* The practical
effect may be the same where there is an acquired right which requires compliance with
aprecondition to be exercisable and a suspensive condition,” but if there is a
requirement which must be complied with before the right can be exercised it cannot be an

acquired right.**°

Whilst Article 58 of the 2001 Mining Code grants the exclusive right, inter alia, to exploit
minerals, it does not say that this is an acquired right. Again, Article 14 of the 2001 Mining
Code does not say that, by entering into the concession, Eco Oro gained an acquired right to

exploit, it merely provides that (i) concession contracts are the only type of mining contract

permitted under the 2001 Mining Code; and (ii) mining titles issued prior to the effective

date of the 2001 Mining Code are to remain in force.**!

Whilst Eco Oro had an acquired right to explore and an acquired right to apply for an
environmental licence, given that Constitutional Court Judgement 339 of 2002 confirmed
the possibility of establishing mining exclusion zones in the paramo pursuant to Articles 34
and 36 of the 2001 Mining Code, Eco Oro would have known its application would be

refused and therefore it is not even as if Eco Oro has lost any opportunity.4°

A “right to a stabilized mining legal framework” does not constitute a Treaty-protected
investment, being merely a statutory right and not a contractual right.** It is therefore not a

covered investment capable of being expropriated.

Eco Oro’s acquired rights were therefore: (i) to the availability of that part of
Concession 3452 that is not restricted by an environmental exclusion zone to conduct
exploration activities, subject to the obtention, where applicable, of the necessary
environmental permits (as these permits are different in nature to an environmental
licence it does not change the nature of this acquired right); and (ii) to apply for an

environmental licence.

The breach of an acquired right does give right to compensation, whereas the breach of a
mere expectation does not.*** However, as Eco Oro had no acquired right to exploitation, it

has no right to compensation.

Finally, Eco Oro does not have any right to renew its concession for an additional 30 years
because such a right would only have vested had Eco Oro reached the exploitation phase;
Eco Oro remained in the exploration phase, having not, inter alia, obtained an environmental

licence.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

416. Eco Oro’s right to exploit will only benefit from constitutional protection pursuant to
Article 58 of the Political Constitution if it is an acquired right. Eco Oro says it is whereas

Colombia says it is not. Article 58 provides as follows:

“All private property is guaranteed, together with other rights acquired in
accordance with the civil laws, which may not be ignored or undermined by
subsequent laws. When the application of a law passed for the purpose of
public utility or social interest results in a conflict between the rights of
individuals and the need recognized in said law, the private interest shall be
subordinate to the public or social interest. Property has a social function
that implies obligations. As such, an ecological dimension is inherent in it.
The State will protect and promote associative and joint forms of property.
Expropriation may be carried out for reasons of public utility or social
interest defined by the legislature, subject to a judicial decision and prior
compensation. The compensation will be determined by taking into account
the interests of the community and of the individual concerned. In cases
determined by the legislature, the expropriation may be carried out by means
of administrative action, subject to subsequent litigation before the
administrative law courts, including with regard to the value of
compensation.”*>

417. In Judgment C-529 the Constitutional Court drew the distinction between those rights

protected by Article 58 and mere expectations, noting:

“[Page 9]
The provision [Article 58 of the Political Constitution] refers to consolidated
legal situations, not those ing to mere ex, i Given that in mere

 

 

 

expectations the right has not been acquired, they are subject to future
regulation introduced by law.

It is clear that an amendment or repeal of a given legal provision produces
effects to the future, except for the principle of most favorable rule, such that

i ions which were lidated under the ded or repealed provision
may _not be impaired. Therefore, pursuant to the constitutional provision,
individual and concrete rights which have already been acquired by a person
are not affected by the new rules, which can only apply to legal situations
arising afier the rules’ entry into force.” *® [Tribunal’s emphasis]

418. The Constitutional Court further stated in Judgment No. C-168 that:

 

p. ll
“Private property and other acquired rights under civil law are guaranteed
and_cannot_be_ disregarded _or infringed _by_sub laws. When the

 

application of a law issued to protect a public interest or a social interest

results in a conflict between the rights of individuals and the interest
d by the law, the private interest must yield to the public or social

interest...

[...]

acquired rights are the legal powers regularly exercised and the expectation

of having legal powers that are not exercised at the time of the change in

legislation”. (Explanations of Comparative Chilean Civil Law, Volume I,

pp. 64 and following)

[...]

Bare expectations do not constitute rights, nor potential rights. They refer to

factual situations rather than legal situations: they are interests that are not

legally protected and that resemble ‘castles in the sky’...

 

 

 

As can be seen, case law as well as doctrine distinguish acquired rights from
bare expectations, and ... the legislators, when issuing the new law, cannot
harm or ignore them. The same does not occur with lled ‘ex

because as their name indicates, they are merely the probability or hope there
is of one day obtaining a right; ly, they can be ch d at the
lawmaker’s discretion.

Our Supreme Law expressly protects acquired rights, in article 58, and
prohibits lawmakers from issuing laws that will hurt or ignore them, leaving
so-called exp ic whose lation is the Ip e of I. kers,
outside of this coverage, in accordance with the parameters of equity and
justice that the very Constitution has laid out for the performance of their duty.
[...]

In conclusion: acquired rights are incorporated definitively to the equity of
the owner, and are covered from any official act that might ignore them

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the Constitution itself guarantees and protects it; the same does not
occur _with_ex ie which _in_general_lack legal relevance, and
ly_can_be_ch 1_or_ extinguished _by_lawmakers,[...)’**"

176/387

420. The Tribunal first considers the position as at the date on which Eco Oro’s ten titles were

458

the provisions of Article 101 of the 2001 Mining Code.

“7. Acquired rights

In line with the decisions of this Constitutional Court, acquired rights are
rights which have definitively become part of a person’s estate. Thus, a right
has been acquired when the person asserting the right satisfies the
requirements established in the law, i.e. when the legal premises are fully met.
In line with this notion, n lidated legal situations, i.e. those where the

factual requirements for the isition of the right have not been satisfied,

do not constitute acquired rights but mere expectations.
[RESPONDENT’S TRANSLATION]
[p. 19]
In this regard the Court said:
The Court has indicated that acquired rights are violated when a law affects
established legal situations that give rise to a right of a sub. ive nature that
has_definitively become_part_of a_person’s estate. However, if the
circumstances indicated have not been met, what exists is a mere expectation
that can be modified or extinguished by the legislator. (Ruling C-584/97, MP.
Eduardo Cifuentes Mufioz)
With regard to their scope of protection, the Court has said that, by express
provision of article 58 of the Constitution, acquired rights are ii ib
which implies that they cannot be disregarded by sub. laws, although
laws_may_modify or _even_extinguish_the_rights_over_which
individuals have mere expectations.
As the Court has emphasized, case law and doctrine have clearly
differentiated between acquired rights and bare expectations, and they agree
that the former are intangible and therefore the legislator, in issuing the new
law, cannot harm or disregard them. This is not the case with the so-called
‘expectations’, because as their name indicates, they are only the probability
or hope to one day obtain a right; consequently, they can be modified at the
discretion of the legislator. (Ruling C-453 of 2002 Alvaro Tafur Galvis)
[Page 20]
From the abovementioned jurisprudence it may be concluded that neither a
law nor the administrative or judicial authorities may modify legal situations
which have become consolidated under an earlier law, but they can do so
where only mere expectations are concerned.”*** [Tribunal’s emphasis]

 

 

  

 

 

integrated into Concession 3452. Whilst Article 6 of the 1988 Mining Code provided that
duly executed concession contracts and licences and permits are treated as giving rise to
acquired rights, this is not relevant to the Tribunal’s analysis. Having voluntarily sought

integration of its titles, Eco Oro relinquished all of the rights it held at that point pursuant to

Constitutional Court, Judgment No. C-314 (1 April 2004) (Exhibit PMR-16) (USB drive provided at the
Hearing).

This is the consequence of

459

460

acogimiento under Article 101, as described by Professor Ricaurte in her commentary to the

2001 Mining Code, and as advised by Mr. De Vivero.**?

The Tribunal next looks for guidance in Concession 3452. Clause One of Concession 3452
provides that the object of the Concession is “to undertake a project of economic exploitation
[...] in the entire area set out in Clause Two of this agreement.”* The Tribunal
notes there is no guarantee that economic exploitation will be achieved. Clause Five of
Concession 3452 and Article 85 of the 2001 Mining Code specify that Eco Oro could not
proceed to exploitation without having received approval of its PTO and having obtained an
environmental licence. There is no provision which addresses the legal status of Eco Oro’s
right to exploit Concession 3452, nor does the Concession agreement make any distinction
between the right to explore and the right to exploit or their respective legal natures. Further,
no provision provides whether the requirements to obtain an approved PTO and an
environmental licence are suspensive conditions such that the right to exploit is only a bare
expectation which does not vest until these conditions are satisfied. It is therefore unclear
merely upon a review of the Concession whether Eco Oro’s right to exploit is an acquired

right but which can only be exercised upon the obtention of the necessary approvals.

Both experts accept that Concession 3452 was subject to one legal regime, the 2001 Mining
Code. In seeking to construe the relevant provisions of the 2001 Mining Code, it is of
assistance to note the following. Firstly, the Congressional Gazette No. 113 (14 April 2000),

summary of the Congressional discussions that preceded its issuance, states as follows:

“The Concession Contract
Definition

Given that, as a general rule, the only title granted by the State for the

hnical exploration and exploitation of mining resources shall hereafter be
the concession contract, it is pertinent to define it and highlight its typical
elements. This is not a mere theoretical intellectual exercise, but rather it
constitutes a highly useful tool for its correct interpretation and for the
appropriate resolution of conflicts and discrepancies arising out of
their execution.

M. Ricaurte, Commentary to the 2001 Mining Code (2017) (Exhibit R-195), Art. 101.
Concession Contract 3452 (8 February 2007) (Exhibit C-16), Clause 1.

178/387

1. The definition of concession put forth in Article 49 of the Bill covers both a
formal and a teleological approach. As regards the former, it confirms that a

ion is a true contractual transaction ing that it is a meeting of
the minds between the State and a private party. Perhaps on its face this might
look like an unimportant or redundant assertion, but its purpose is nothing
other than to legally rule out certain lines of thinking which to this day persist,
according to which concessions of this kind are not true contracts but mere
permits or authorizations unilaterally issued or granted by the State for
exploiting the State’s own resources.

The definition is also adopted with the criterion of identifying the object of the
contract, which is to carry out the studies, hanisms and works that have
an_exclusive purpose: to exploit the soil or_the_mining subsoil at_the
contractor ’s own expense and risk. Moreover, this latter aspect excludes, as
an element of the contract, the performance of the contract in full or in part
through state investments.” *! [Tribunal’s emphasis]

423. Secondly, MinMinas’ explanatory statement in April 2000 to the Colombian Congress for

461

462

463,

the enactment of the 2001 Mining Code, inter alia, states that: “[...] the Bill’s aim is for the
new Mining Code to become a useful and efficient tool for the [mining] industry's
development and, as such, its greatest contribution is to offer, by means of categorical and
express mandates, a clear and firm legal stability to the private parties that participate in

the exploration and_exploitation of mining resources.”4

[Tribunal’s emphasis].
In June 2000, the Congressional Gazette also records that Article 46 of the 2001 Mining
Code “enshrined a principle that is essential for the legal stability required by the
concessionaire, in addition to vesting the concessionaire with the right to be subjected only
to favourable changes in legislation.”*° Finally, in May 2001, the Colombian
Congressional records as contained in the Report to the House of Representatives note that
the 2001 Mining Code “enshrines the principle of the stable contractual legal framework

[Normatividad], which guarantees that throughout the contract’s performance, and

7464

Turning to the 2001 Mining Code, several Articles refer to a concession agreement as
providing the exclusive right to exploit as well as explore (Articles 15, 45 and 58 by way of
example) however those articles refer to the right to exploit as being an exclusive right; there
is no express provision in the 2001 Mining Code identifying which, if any, of the rights
granted by a concession agreement are acquired rights. Article 58 details what rights are

granted under the Concession:

“ARTICLE 58. RIGHTS UNDER THE CONCESSION.

The concession contract shall grant the concessionaire the exclusive power to
perform, within the area granted, any such studies and works as may be
necessary to establish the existence of the minerals that are the subject-matter
of the contract, and to exploit them in accordance with the principles, rules
and criteria inherent in the mining engineering and geology accepted
techniques. The concessionaire shall also be entitled to install and perform,
within and outside such area, the equipment, services and works required to
efficiently exercise the easements referred to herein.’*® [Tribunal’s
emphasis]

Eco Oro further cites Article 46 which provides:

“ARTICLE 46. APPLICABLE LAW

The mining laws in force at the time that the concession contract is perfected
will be applicable throughout the term of its execution and extensions. If said
laws are modified or added to at a later date, these laws will apply to the
concessionaire only insofar as they broaden, confirm or improve its rights
with the exception of those regulations that contemplate the modification of
the anticipated economic revenues to the State or Territorial Entities.” +

Again, this Article does not expressly provide that the right to exploit is an acquired right.
However, it is of note that the 2001 Mining Code does not provide that the right to explore
is an acquired right. The terminology used to describe the right to explore is that it is an

“exclusive power” and yet the Parties agree that the right to explore is an acquired right. The

429,

467

terminology with respect to the right to exploit is the same as that with respect to the right to
explore, namely that it is an “exclusive power.” Accordingly, the Tribunal does not find that
there is any relevance to the fact that the 2001 Mining Code does not provide that the right
to exploit is an acquired right. It appears that at no time in the discussions leading to the
issuance of the 2001 Mining Code was any distinction drawn between the rights to explore

and to exploit, both being spoken of as rights obtained under a concession agreement.

The relevant authorities would also appear to have been acting under the belief that the right
to exploit was an acquired right which was therefore protected by Article 58 of the
Constitution. For example, in September 2011, MinMinas (Ms. Diaz Lopez) wrote to
INGEOMINAS (Mr. Montes) stating:

“Finally, the position of the control organs in relation to the protection of

natural resources is clear to this Office. Thus, the precautionary principle

constitutes one of the fund / tenets of Colombian envil ! policy.

However, such principle cannot disregard acquired rights, in accordance

with Article 58 of the Political Constitution.” *°’ [Tribunal’s emphasis]
In providing this opinion, MinMinas noted that it was not commenting upon a specific case
but giving a general opinion. In addition to raising serious doubts as to the legality of
Resolution 937 of 2011, it considered the concept of acquired rights. However, in doing so,
it did not address whether the rights it identified as acquired rights were merely exploration
rights or exploration and exploitation rights. Had MinMinas been of the belief that
exploitation rights were not acquired rights, it seems unlikely that it would have addressed
the application of the precautionary principle on acquired rights. It has not been suggested

that exploration rights should be excluded to protect the paramo.

In May 2012, MinMinas issued Opinion 2012026198 in response to a question raised by the
Attorney General’s Office regarding Mining Concession Contracts stating: “However, this
is not the case with the concession contracts that have been duly granted, which at the time

of execution give rise to acquired rights which become part of the concessionaire’s

(Exhibit C-330).

patrimony subject to protection by the law.”*% Whilst no explanation is given as to the
nature of the rights that are referred to as being acquired, again the Tribunal does not
understand there to have been any distinction drawn between exploration and exploitation

rights.

430. Ina memorandum issued in December 2013, the ANM stated:

468

“[Page 20]

It is then undeniable that the notion of acquired rights and, naturally,
consolidated situations are directly related to the application of the Law in
time, as in no event may a subsequent Law produce retroactive effects
intended, as suggested in this case, to deny a legal situation created and
consolidated under an earlier Law.

[...]

[Page 23]

It is therefore clear that Mining Concession Contract No. 141, having been
executed in strict observance of the law in force at the time, which, it is worth
noting again, did not contain any prohibition on entering into a contract in
the area that is the object of the present Contract, granted EXPLOTACIONES
CARBONIFERAS YERBABUENA LTDA a true right to exploit a coal deposit
in the icipality of Zi ira, which i an acquired right; that is
to say, it consolidated a subjective legal right that must be respected despite
the legislative changes that were to eventuate.

[...]

[Page 24]

It is particularly important to draw the attention of the Honorable Court to

the fact that in the present matter, when Contract No. 141 was executed, it
enerated for the contracting parties a duly lidated legal right and not

a mere expectation, for which reason a subsequent provision cannot act as an

7

 

 

 

 

im such that the right is ignored. This is the understanding of the
Constitutional Court in Decision C-478 of 1998 [...}.

Le]

[Page 26]

Le]

In accordance with the above considerations, it is relevant to highlight what
the Ministry of Mines and Energy has said, precisely regarding the prevalence
of acquired rights when the declaration of forest protection reserve areas
occurs after the granting of a mining title. Accordingly, the Ministry expressed
in a report filed under number 2012026647 of 16 May 2012, as follows:
[page 27]

Ministry of Mines and Energy, Opinion 2012026198 in response to a question raised by the Attorney General’s
Office regarding Mining Concession Contracts (14 May 2012) (Exhibit PMR-26).

“.. Thus, where an area is declared to be a forest protection reserve, in which
it is not ible to carry out mining activities in accordance with article 34
of Law 685 of 2001, mining titles granted prior to the declaration of the area
must in any case be respected, as those titles give rise to acquired rights on
the part of the mining titleholders that cannot be ignored under sub.
laws.[...]*

 

 

 

Again, in their letter to MinAmbiente, of 24 February 2014, the Mayors of Soto Norte
and other Municipalities refer to the acquired rights of mining titleholders in circumstances
in which the Tribunal understands the reference to be to exploitation as well as

to exploration.4”°

Colombia supports its contention that the right to exploit is not an acquired right by reference
to Advisory Opinion 2233. However, the Consejo de Estado does not state that a right to
exploit is not an acquired right. The opinion considers the question of payment of
compensation where a mining exclusion zone is declared over a concession area.
The Consejo de Estado first considers the tensions between, on the one hand, the general
interest in protecting the environment and, on the other hand, the private interest of those in
possession of mining concessions which it held can be seen as “a declaration of principle
that [the mining] activity is one of general interest and is encouraged by the government
itself, which is further supported by various sections of the Mining Code aimed at providing
legal certainty and assurance to those conducting this activity in a legal manner that is

compatible with the environment.”*”!

433. The Consejo de Estado then details the rights granted by the mining concession, stating:

“The rights granted by the mining concession are indicated in two additional
statutes from the Mining Code: (i) Article 15 indicates that the concession
contract does not grant ownership over the minerals on site, but rather grants
the right to ‘establish, exclusively and temporarily within the concession
area, the existence of minerals in an exploitable quantity and quality, and to
appropriate them by extracting or capturing them’; and (ii) Article 45,
whereby the ion contract grants to the ion holder exclusive
authority to conduct within the concession area the studies, works and
projects necessary to establish the existence of the minerals to which the
contract refers and to exploit those minerals, [...] at the risk and expense of
the concession-holder, and the closing or removal of the corresponding works
and sites.”

 

In this way the mining concession grants to its holder the right to explore and
exploit the assigned areas and also to shut down and close the respective
activities, all in strict adherence [...] to environmental regulations.

It is thus clear that those who have obtained from the government a mining
concession, which is understood to have been granted for lands for which
such activity is permitted (the code itself, in Article 36, excludes outright those
areas for which mining is not permitted), are entitled to the expectation that
their lawful activity will be respected and will be allowed to carry on during
the term of the contract, which is 30 years (Article 70). Without a doubt, there
can be medium- and long-term endeavors and investments should be
recognized.”*”* [Tribunal’s emphasis]

434. The Consejo de Estado concludes that the private right of the investor must yield to the

general interest in preserving the environment such that holders of concessions in areas
where a mining exclusion zone is subsequently declared do not have a right to mine in that
mining exclusion zone. However, whilst the Consejo de Estado does not expressly state that
the right to exploit is, or is not, an acquired right (noting only that the concession agreement
gives an exclusive authority to exploit), it continues by stating that “the government must
review on a case-by-case basis the need to reach agreements for economic compensation, in
order to avoid legal claims’, further noting that there would be no breach of any bilateral
treaty agreement unless the State “refiise[d] to provide the necessary compensation for the

specific situations affected by the new law.”*?

In understanding the meaning of this opinion, the Tribunal notes that Article 58 of the
Constitution provides that the State may carry out expropriation “for reasons of public utility
or social interest [...] subject to a judicial decision and prior compensation.”*" It would
not have been necessary for the Consejo de Estado to refer to a need for compensation upon
taking away a right to exploit if such right were merely a bare expectation that did not vest
until the requisite suspensive conditions had been complied with. There would only be the
need to undertake a case-by-case review to determine whether compensation were payable
if the right to exploit were an acquired right, the loss of which would, prima facie, give rise
to a right to compensation; the purpose of the review being to determine the value of the
exploitation right lost in the light of the surrounding circumstances, no doubt including the
progression and current status of the exploration activities undertaken at that time the zone

was declared.

Eco Oro also cites in support of its submissions the Consejo de Estado judgements dated
3 February 2010 (which it says holds that the concession contract grants economic rights
which are opposable to third parties and assignable in accordance with the law*”>),

14 May 20124” and 6 July 2017.*”” The 2017 decision*” states at paragraph 23 that:

“23. [the concession agreement] is evident that the mining title granted to the
private respondent was previous to the declaration and delimitation of the
special reserve area that overlapped with the concession, which is why it had

an_acquired right that could not be ignored. In fact, article 46 of [the 2001
Mining Code], which entails the National Government's prerogative to

declare these type of areas of special interest, clearly establishes that these
cannot ignore titles that predate their establishment [...].

24. it must be noted that the claimant has insisted on the fact that the
necessary activities for the delimitation of the reserve area began before the
execution and registry of the title in favor of Mr Rendle. However it must not
be overlooked that the final delimitation, for reasons of publicity to those
interested in the mining titles of the area, only becomes binding with the
issuance of the act that declares and delimits the special public interest area.

25. Moreover, this Chamber does not ignore that the claimant begun the
proceedings to declare the nullity of the concession contract in light of the
undeniable breach of the public interest. But even though it is clear that
lawmakers wanted to restrict third parties’ mining and exploration and
exploitation expectations in reserve areas in order to protect the public
interest, it is also evident that lawmakers wanted to prevent the public interest
from impinging upon the acquired rights of private parties holding titles that
predate the establishment of the area, which is precisely what has happened

in the present case.” [Tribunal’s emphasis]

437. Turning to the Consejo de Estado Judgment No. 52038,*” it was held that:

follow:

“4.5. On the other hand, a duly granted and registered mining title creates a
consolidated legal situation, as a result of the principle of legal certainty.
This grants _an_exclusive right to exploit the mining resources of the

area, its appropriation through its extraction or collection and

subsequent economic traffic.

4.6. Regarding legislation, that protection is reflected in the general rule that
the contract is subject to those legal provisions that were in force at the time
of its conclusion, which stands as an unobjectionable_contractual_and

it / guarantee of acquired rights since, idering the decisic
of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, acquired rights are ‘rights
that have been incorporated into the estate of a person.’

4.7. Therefore, as to the practical aspect, the protection afforded by the law
is reflected in instruments such as the mining protection action provided for
in Articles 307 et_seg.{**°| of the Mining Code, which affords onsite
protection for exploration or exploitation works carried out by the mining
title holder against any statements that disrupt, alter or affect the

There is no translation into English of these provisions. Article 307 of the 2001 Mining Code provides as
“PERTURBACION. El beneficiario de un titulo minero podré solicitar ante el alcalde, amparo

performance of the mining activities. This_instrument_is_intended_to
uarantee the full enjoyment and exercise of the rights that the title holder
has acquired by executing the concession contract.” [Tribunal’s emphasis]
In 2019, whilst not commenting specifically on the legal status of the right to exploit, the
Consejo de Estado stated the following with respect to the nature of the rights granted by a

concession agreement:

“The Ministry of Mines and Energy issued the following opinion on the rights
stemming from the execution of a mining concession agreement:

‘Before the State, the applicant only has an expectation of obtaining the
respective title, given that due to the ongoing process of the concession
proposal, while these are not fully finished, the interested parties will only
have a mere expectation to obtain the title.

However, this is not the case with the concession contracts that have been
duly granted, which at the time of execution give rise to acquired rights

which become part of the concessionaire’s patrimony subject to protection
by the law. ”**' [Tribunal’s emphasis]

Having reviewed all the documentation provided to the Tribunal by the Parties, including
the congressional discussions with respect to the proposed 2001 Mining Code,
communications from relevant State bodies and interested parties, Advisory Opinion 2233
and the judgements of the Consejo de Estado and the Constitutional Court which were
referred to the Tribunal, it is clear to the majority of the Tribunal that whilst there is no
express authority upon which it can rely, this arises from the general understanding that the
rights a party acquired under a concession agreement were indivisible: a concessionaire is
granted acquired rights to explore and to exploit, entitling it to compensation if its economic
equilibrium was disrupted. The fact the exploitation right may be difficult to value, or indeed
may be valueless in circumstances where it has almost no chance of getting an environmental

licence, cannot and does not of itself mean it is not an acquired right.

Therefore, as at the date of entry into force of the FTA, the Tribunal finds that Eco Oro had
acquired rights to explore in the totality of the area of Concession 3452 (Article 58 of the
2001 Mining Code and Clause 4 of the Concession 3452). The majority of the Tribunal finds

that Eco Oro had acquired rights to exploit in the totality of the area of Concession 3452
(Article 58 of the 2001 Mining Code and Clauses | and 4 of Concession 3452), the exercise
of such rights being subject to PTO approval and obtaining an environmental license; and
extend the concession at the end of its term (Article 77 of the 2001 Mining Code and Clause
4 of Concession 3452).

‘WHETHER THERE WAS A MINING BAN OVER ANY PART OF CONCESSION 3452 IN EXISTENCE
AS AT THE DATE THE FTA ENTERED INTO FORCE
Having determined the nature of Eco Oro’s covered investments at the time the FTA entered
into force, the Tribunal now turns to consider whether there was a mining ban in force when

the FTA came into existence.

(1) The Parties’ Positions
(a) The Claimant’s Position

Articles 34 and 36 of the 2001 Mining Code do not permit Colombia to ban mining in paramo
areas with immediate effect on Concession 3452, without an express declaration that the
concession falls within that area and upon notification of such restriction. Constitutional
Court Judgement 339 of 2002 does not have the effect contended for by Colombia; it merely
provides that the list of areas in Article 34 where exclusion zones can be established is not

exhaustive and it just eliminates the phrase in Article 36 “pursuant to the prior articles.”

Article 34 provides that exclusion zones can only take effect once the three stated
requirements in the article have been complied with, namely: (i) the mining exclusion is
expressly provided for by law or regulation; (ii) the exclusion zone has been geographically
delimited on the basis of technical, environmental, social and economic studies
demonstrating the incompatibility of the area with mining activities; and (iii) the exclusion
zone has been delimited with the collaboration of the mining authority. An exclusion cannot

be lawful if not undertaken in accordance with these requirements.

Article 36 addresses the effect of an exclusion that has come into force either pursuant to
Article 34 or from the application of another provision of the 2001 Mining Code. It is clear

from the wording of Article 34 (and construing it in the context of Articles 31 — 35) that it

188/387

445.

can only have an effect on a subsequently executed concession contract — an exclusion can
only be expressly mentioned in a concession if such concession is already in existence at the
time the concession is executed but the exclusion need not be “expressly mentioned” as the
concessionaire would be aware of it. The purpose of specifying that such restriction need
not be mentioned is that it may well be burdensome and impractical to expressly carve out
of each mining title areas corresponding, for example, to roads, power lines and rural
dwellings; indeed the mining authority may not even be aware of any excluded or restricted
areas at the time the title is granted.**? Therefore, the provision must be referring to pre-
existing restrictions and exclusions. Article 36’s application to subsequent concessions is
also clear from the fact that the “renunciation of the applicant’ to the exclusion zone is not
required — there is no purpose in an applicant renunciating the exclusion zone because it is
excluded as of right. Further, the provision “if in fact said zones [...] were to be occupied”
clearly refers to the situation where an exclusion exists, the concession is executed and yet
the concessionaire continues to carry out mining activities in such area. In this situation, the
activities would be illegal and the concessionaire would be forced to withdraw without

compensation.

Establishing an exclusion zone after execution of a concession would breach the provisions
of Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code, which enshrines the principle of non-retroactivity of
laws to acquired rights, a provision which stabilises mining laws. The effect of Article 46
was confirmed by the Constitutional Court as follows: “[...] Jn fact, article 46 of law 685 of
2001, Mining Code, which entails the National Government prerogative to declare these
type of areas of special interest, clearly establishes that these [areas] cannot ignore titles
that predate their establishment [...].”**° This principle of non-retroactivity of laws and the
respect for acquired rights set out in Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code is also enshrined in

Article 58 of the Political Constitution.“

The same principle was confirmed by Advisory Opinion 2233.**> Thus, a mining exclusion
zone delimited subsequent to the execution of a concession will apply to the concession (i) if
enacted for reasons of public interest; and (ii) upon the payment of compensation.**°
Pursuant to Article 90 of the Constitution, this compensation must include compensation for
the actual damages suffered (damnun emergens), certain future losses (/ucrum cessans) and

the loss of a chance (uncertain future losses).**’

Laws 1382 and 1450 also did not establish an effective mining ban in the paramos.

Paragraph | of Law 1382 contained a grandfathering regime as follows:

“If on the effective date of this law, any construction and assembly or
exploitation activities are being undertaken subject to a mining title and an
environmental licence or their equivalent in areas which were not previously
excluded, such activities shall be allowed until their expiration, but no
extensions shall be granted with regard to such titles.”*8
Law 1382 was struck down by the Constitutional Court in May 2011 as unconstitutional
having been enacted in the absence of community consultations. Whilst Advisory Opinion
2233 stated that the first time paramo exclusion zones were established was by Law 1382,*°°
this did not mean that an immediately effective mining ban had been established in the
Santurban Paramo as a result of Law 1382. Article 3 required the mining exclusion zone to
be delineated on the basis of technical, social and environmental studies and on the basis of
cartographic information to be provided by the IAvH.*”° Thus, the mining ban could not
become effective until the paramos had been delineated in accordance with these
requirements. The fact no mining ban had immediately become effective is demonstrated
by the actions of Colombia in adopting Decree 2820,*”! Article 10 of which anticipated
mining in paramo ecosystems. Further, Article 1 of INGEOMINAS Resolution 267 of

15 December 2010 extended the exploration phase of the entirety of the area of Concession

3452 for two years.

The 2007 Atlas did not entail a mining ban in the paramos. It had no normative content, was
just an academic exercise and the purpose was “to compile all information available at the
time about the paramos and identify the actions taken to protect them.” Indeed, the
methodology used was inadequate for the purposes of validly determining a paramo

ecosystem.*?

Whilst the effects of the striking down of Law 1382 were deferred for two years, Law 1450
was enacted in June 2011, which required delimitation based on technical, social,
environmental and economic criteria. Again, no mining ban could become effective
until delimitation in compliance with these requirements had been undertaken. Therefore,
Laws 1382 and 1450 did not ban mining in the areas of the Concession overlapping the 2007
Atlas, Eco Oro continued mining activities in those areas after this time and Colombia
designated the Project a PIN, demonstrating that mining in the concession area had not

been excluded.

Resolution 937 also did not create a permanent mining ban; it merely adopted the 2007 Atlas
as a reference for the identification and delimitation of the paramo ecosystems (Article 1).
This was explained in a letter from MinMinas to INGEOMINAS on 27 September 2011:
“Currently, the requirements for declaring paramo ecosystems in the country, as set out by
current norms, are not met. Although the transitory provision of [Law 1450] orders that the
cartography of [the 2007 Atlas] be used as a reference, at no point does it determine that
the zones excluded from mining are established by such cartography.”*”? In any event, this
Resolution failed to meet the requirements of Laws 1382 and 1450 in that it wasn’t based on

Resolution was only issued one week before Eco Oro’s application for an environmental
licence for its open-pit mine was denied by the environmental authorities and yet such denial
was not on the basis of Resolution 937 or the 2007 Atlas, but rather on detailed technical

reasons. *?°
The fact there was no mining ban is further confirmed by:

a. ANLA’s Resolution 35 of 31 October 2011, which stated that “[...] the Ministry
has not declared an exclusion zone for mining in the paramo ecosystem [...]” and
that the IAvH cartographic information had not been used to identify and quantify

the area of the different bioclimatic levels within the area of interest.*”°

b. Whilst Resolution VSC 2 only granted Eco Oro an extension over non-overlapping
areas of Concession 3452, this was overturned by Resolution VSC 4 which stated
that Article 202 of Law 1450 “had not been developed” so that the paramo could
not be delimited “with absolute certainty” and that, therefore, the legal status of the
overlapping area of Concession 3452 was “uncertain” as “it cannot be said with
complete certainty, due to the absence of technical parameters, that it is located
within the paramo.” As a result, the exploration phase for the entirety of
Concession 3452 was extended for a further two years, albeit it was noted that no
exploratory activities could be carried out in the paramo area pursuant to
Article 202 of Law 1450 “until the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable
Development or the entity acting in its capacity issues the final delimitation to a

scale of 1:25,000.”4°"

(b) The Respondent’s Position

. Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code empowers MinAmbiente to exclude areas from mining

activities, including paramo areas as confirmed by Constitutional Court Judgement 339 of

2002. Paramos were defined in Resolution 769 of 2002 to include low high Andean

forests.*°* This exclusion zone could be achieved either through the creation of a national
park or through the delimitation of a paramo ecosystem and the fact such zone was declared
over all or part of an area where a concession had been granted is irrelevant. This should
have been well understood by Eco Oro when it executed Concession 3452 and was a risk

that Eco Oro voluntarily assumed.

Article 36 confirms that where a restriction on mining arises, it is immediately applicable,
without the need for any express declaration, such that mining is prohibited de jure in those
areas designated as a mining exclusion zone and is applicable to any existing concession,
not just future concessions. Had it been intended that it was only to apply to future
concessions this would have been explicitly provided for in Article 36. This was the case
with Article 9 of the 1988 Mining Code which expressly provided that any exclusion zone
declared would not affect mining titles which had already been granted. This construction
is also clear from the fact that Article 36 provides that it is unnecessary for a concessionaire
to waive any of its rights in order for the exclusion zone to take effect by operation of law.
Eco Oro’s construction makes no sense — it would be absurd to grant a mining concession
over an area where a mining exclusion zone had been established. Colombia’s construction
is also supported by the 2002 Judgement C-339 of the Constitutional Court.*°? Colombia
does not say that at the time Concession 3452 was executed, the Santurban Paramo had been
designated and excluded. For it to succeed, Colombia does not need to show that there was
an outright ban, Colombia was entitled to wait to see the nature of the mining proposed by

Eco Oro before deciding whether or to introduce a mining ban.>°°

Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code is not a stabilisation clause, it merely enshrines the basic
general principle of non-retroactivity of the law and confirms that concession contracts are
governed by the legislative framework in existence at the time the concession contract was
entered into. Further, it makes no reference to environmental protection legislation, merely
to mining laws and its lack of applicability to environmental protection legislation was

confirmed by Advisory Opinion 2233 specifically referring to the protection of paramo

ecosystems.**! Indeed, Article 196 of the 2001 Mining Code specifies that all environmental
provisions and regulations apply immediately to all mining activities and the travaux to the

2001 Mining Code note that Article 46 does not stabilise environmental laws, stating that

 

“[...] there can be rules following the ssion contract, that must ssarily be applied

hnical

to the ionaire, e.g. t. and envir I laws and lations [...J.°>°

Indeed, these travaux have been cited with approval by Professor Ricaurte.

MinAmbiente’s exercise of a right expressly reserved under the 2001 Mining Code does not
constitute a retroactive change of the law but is instead the application of an existing law

which Eco Oro accepted on executing Concession 3452.

. Law 1382 together with the MinAmbiente’s Resolution 937 of May 2011 banned mining in

paramo ecosystems as delimited in the 2007 Atlas.

Although Law 1382 was struck down, the effect was suspended for two years such that the

ban continued uninterrupted as per the following:
a. MinAmbiente Resolution 937 of May 2011;
b. Law 1450 (which confirmed its immediate application);
c. Law 1753 of 2015; and
d. Law 1930 of 2018.

The fact the ban had been operative since 9 February 2010 was confirmed by Advisory
Opinion 2233 which provided that, “with respect to mining activities, the ban on undertaking

them in paramo ecosystems has been operative in Colombia since February 9 2010.°°

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

the need to protect the environment and of the importance and fragility of the paramo

ecosystem. This can be seen from the General Environmental Law, which was published on
22 December 1993, the Biodiversity Convention having entered into force in Colombia on
29 January 1996, the Ramsar Convention entering into force on 18 October 1998, and
Colombia’s adoption of its (green) Constitution. Article 1.1 of the General Environmental
Law is of particular relevance, referring to the relevance of the Rio Principles, Principle 15
of which contained the precautionary principle (namely that “where there are threats of

serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason

for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation”; also know as

in dubio pro ambiente) and which was enshrined into Colombian Law by Article 1.6 of the
said General Environmental Law.*™ In addition, Article 1.4 provides that “the paramo and
sub paramo areas, water springs and aquifer recharge zones shall be the subject of special

protection.”

Before the 2001 Mining Code came into force, it is common ground that Permit 3452 was

not in a prohibited area.

The key provisions of the 2001 Mining Code with respect to Colombia’s right to impose a

mining ban and the manner in which it is to be undertaken are Articles 34, 36 and 46.

(a) Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code

. Articles 34 and 36 are not easy to construe. Article 34 is titled “Areas that may be excluded

from mining.” At the very least, this puts a potential investor on notice that it was in the mind

of the legislator that certain mining activities could be banned in certain areas. The text
might be construed to include areas in which mining has been excluded as well as those in
which it may be excluded, i.e., a future delimitation. However, the phraseology is
contradictory in the body of the article. The text first refers to areas where mining

exploration and exploitation may not be carried out in areas “declared and delimited” (which

The Consejo de Estado in its Advisory Opinion, quoting Constitutional Court judgments C-703 of 2010 and
C-988 of 2004, notes with regard to the precautionary principle that “although it is part of the positive order,
with legal rank, in any case ‘it has been constitutionalized, since it is derived from the internationalization of
ecological relations (Article 266 of the Constitution) and from the duties of protection and prevention
contained in articles 78, 79 and 80 of the Charter’ in addition to the fact that it derives from the duty imposed
on the authorities ‘to avoid damages and risks to life, health and the environment™. See Consejo de Estado,
Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (Exhibit R-135).

465.

could be construed as referring to the fact that areas are already excluded by operation of
Article 34) rather than areas “to be declared and delimited.” This suggests the scope of the
Article relates to areas that have been delimited by virtue of this Article. However, the text
then provides that “exclusion zones will be those constituted in accordance with the legal
provisions in force, such as areas that comprise the system of natural national parks,
regional natural parks and forest reserve areas”; the wording that the exclusion zones
“will be” not “are” those constituted in accordance with the legal provisions in force, and
that the areas “should be” rather than “are” delimited by the environmental authority,
indicates that this is providing for a future delimitation rather to an immediate existing ban.
The inclusion of the phrase “such as” indicates this was not an exhaustive list and therefore,
as stated in Judgement 339, paramo ecosystems may also be declared mining exclusion zones

pursuant to Article 34.

In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that Law 1382 amended Article 34 by adding the
following underlined words that the exclusion zones will be “those that have been
constituted or will be established in accordance with the legal provisions in force [...]”>°
Law 1382 was struck down by Constitutional Court judgement C-366 of 2011 such that the
underlined words are not applicable. This supports the Tribunal’s construction that Article

34 can only apply to future areas to be designated as mining exclusion zones.

Article 34 details the process by which mining exclusion areas are to be declared and
delimited, namely where (i) such declaration and delimitation is undertaken in accordance
with the legal framework currently in force for the protection and development of renewable
natural resources or the environment; (ii) the delimited areas should be geographically
delimited by the environmental authority on the basis of “technical, social and
environmental studies” with the collaboration of the mining authority; and (iii) the act
declaring a mining exclusion area must be expressly based on studies establishing the
incompatibility of or need to restrict mining activities. Having regard to the language of
Article 34 in its entirety, the Tribunal construes it such that it empowers MinAmbiente to

publish, in the future, a mining exclusion zone but requires MinAmbiente to follow the

Law No. 1382 (9 February 2010) (Exhibit C-18) (USB drive provided at the Hearing).

506

specified process in order to achieve this, i.e., a future delimitation. The Tribunal does not

understand this construction to be disputed by Colombia.”

(b) Article 36 of the 2001 Mining Code

Article 36 provides that where mining activities are prohibited, such areas are “deemed
excluded or restricted by operation of law [...] [and] this exclusion or restriction need not
be declared by any authority whatsoever or be expressly stated in acts or stated in acts and
agreements [...].”. The question is whether, when an area is declared as a mining exclusion
zone, does it only apply to future concessions or also to concessions that were already in

existence at the time the exclusion zone is declared.

In construing Article 36, the Tribunal is mindful that, whilst Colombian law contains a
general principle of non-retroactivity, it also allows a public purpose law to have
retrospective effect provided that it is carried out with strict adherence to the principle of
legality, with due process and with appropriate compensation where due. This retrospective
effect is outlined in Advisory Opinion 2233 in which the Consejo de Estado explains (albeit
with respect to the legal effect of Section 202 of Law 1450):

“3. Retroactivity and retrospectivity. Immediate general effect of public
policy rules and their application in environmental matters

The Chamber has identified four general rules for this type of situations that
relate to the application of law over time:

‘1. All laws are applied with respect to the future as of their effective date, on
the understanding that they cannot disregard acquired rights or consolidated
situations and that they produce immediate effects on mere expectations and
ongoing situations.

2. Constitutionally, there are two explicit limits to the effects of new laws that
must be respected by the legislature: the existence of rights acquired with just
title in Article 58 of the Constitution [...]. As_an exception that confirms the
rule, Article 58 allows for the sacrifice of rights acquired under just title ‘for
reasons of public utility or social interest’ subject to

[J

 

Tr. Day 1 (Mr. Mantilla-Serrano), 266:6-267:6.

197/387

A distinction is then made between retroactivity or application of new laws to
situations consolidated (terminated) under a previous rule — which by
constitutional principle is not permitted (Article 58 of the Constitution) — and
retrospectivity or application of the new law to situations in progress at the
time of its entry into force.

LJ

Based on the foregoing, it is possible to understand that the application of the
new law to ongoing situations does not necessarily conflict with Section 58 of
the Constitution: [...]

[J

Therefore, in relation to new laws, it is possible to speak of an application
that is ‘general, immediate and future-orientated, but with retrospectivity’,
that is, with effects on the legal situations in progress at the time of its entry
into force. In this way, unlike situations consolidated or defined under a
previous law — over which a general principle of non-retroactivity applies —
it can be accepted that the new law governs not only the legal situations
arising from its entry into force, but also the present and future legal effects
of those which arose under a previous law (retrospectivity).

This retrospective effect of the law is particularly important in relation to
rules issued on the grounds of morality, public health or utility, in respect of
which Act 153 of 1887 expressly provides for their immediate application,
even when they restrict rights protected in the previous law. [...]

[J

What has just been stated in relation to the immediate application of the rules
of public or social order is even more relevant in environmental matters,
whose provisions have this status by law.

[J

It can then be concluded for the analyzed case that Section 202 of Law 1450
of 2011, being an environmental rule of public order and social interest
nature, has immediate general effect and can be applied with retrospectivity,
unless there is a constitutional reason of greater weight that prevents this or
demands its moderation, as will be seen later.”*°’ [Tribunal’s emphasis]
468. The Consejo de Estado further notes that “since the sacrifice of individual and established

situations does not constitute the general rule of State action and entails a clear afflictive

effect on citizens, their legal position is surrounded by a series of minimum guarantees such
as (i) strict adherence to the principle of legality (compliance with constitutional
requirements); (ii) observance of due process and (iii) payment of compensation to prevent
the Administration’s decision from becoming a ‘confiscatory act, expressly prohibited by
Article 34 of the Constitution.’ [...] Therefore, the constitutional protection of legitimate
expectations determines that normative changes are not made ‘arbitrarily and suddenly
without any consideration for the stability of the legal frameworks that govern the action of
persons and to the detriment of the predictability of the consequences to individuals of

adjusting their behavior to these rules.”

. The fact that certain provisions of the 2001 Mining Code may also be applied or relied upon

to have retrospective effect is confirmed by Article 196 of the 2001 Mining Code. This
Article states “[t]he legal provisions and regulations of an environmental nature” have a
general and immediate application and Article 197 which refers to “environmental

requirements and conditions”*®

which, whether or not “set forth” (as translated by
Colombia) or “contemplated by” (as translated by Eco Oro), must be complied with or met
before the commencement and execution of mining works, in order to be permitted to
exercise rights under the concession contract. These provisions require compliance with
environmental regulations not necessarily contemplated at the time the 2001 Mining Code
was enacted, but which are subsequently enacted. This makes clear that an investor who
proceeded on the basis of the 2001 Mining Code, had clear notice that future environmental

laws or regulations could be applied to have retroactive effect. This may be relevant to

determining the nature and reasonableness of Eco Oro’s expectations.

The Tribunal therefore finds that, provided due process is followed with respect to the
declaration of the mining exclusion zone, following the Consejo de Estado’s analysis with
respect to the retrospective effect of Article 202 of Law 1450, Article 36 may be applied in

a manner that has or allows for retrospective effect, subject to compensation pursuant to

The Tribunal notes the Parties have provided alternative translations of this Article but both refer to
“requirements and conditions” being those that are environmental or of an environmental nature. Law No. 685

Article 58 of the Constitution (the Tribunal considers below whether due process was indeed

followed when delimiting the Santurban Paramo).

The Tribunal notes that when the 2001 Mining Code was published, Article 36 had been
written on the basis that it referred to situations where mining activities had been prohibited
“pursuant to the above articles” but this wording was deleted pursuant to the Constitutional
Court Judgement 339 of 2002. In the Tribunal’s view, the removal of these words does not
change the meaning of Article 36 in that any prohibition contemplated by Article 36 must
have been carried out lawfully and must, therefore, be in compliance with Article 34. Article
36 therefore provides that, when an area is excluded from mining activities in accordance

with the Article 34 requirements, it is deemed excluded with immediate effect.

There is a further contradiction between Article 34 —which expressly requires an “act by
which [the exclusion zones] are declared’— and Article 36, which states that the “exclusion
or restriction need not be declared by any authority whatsoever.”*°? The Tribunal
understands this to mean that for the delimitation to be lawful, there must be some form of
declaration, for example the declaration of the creation of a national natural park, regional
natural park, forest reserve area or paramo ecosystem, which declaration expressly excludes
mining exploration and exploitation works and projects in accordance with Article 34.
However, it is not then necessary for there to be a further declaration that the effect of the
creation of the national natural park, regional natural park, forest reserve area or paramo
ecosystem is that the area within such designated area is a mining exclusion zone. It is an
automatic consequence of the Article 34 declaration that the area immediately becomes a

mining exclusion zone without more.

The Tribunal next turns to consider whether Article 36 excludes the payment of
compensation where a mining exclusion zone comes into being. The last sentence of Article
36 provides that “[...] if such areas or plots of lands were actually the site of a
concessionaire’s works, the mining authority shall order they be immediately removed and
cleared without awarding any payment, compensation or damages whatsoever for this

reason, notwithstanding the proceedings the competent authorities may commence in each

Law No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (Exhibit C-8), Arts. 34, 36.

200/387

474,

case where applicable.”*"° As is clear from the opening words of this sentence, the provision
is directed to a situation where a concessionaire’s works are located in the areas delimited as
mining exclusion zones. The Article provides that “they” shall be removed and cleared
without compensation, but to what does the word “they” refer? Logically, this appears to be
a reference to the concessionaire’s works that must be removed and cleared, such that no
compensation is payable for the removal and clearance of the works themselves. However,
the provision is silent as to whether or not compensation is payable for the loss of any
underlying acquired rights due to any declaration of a mining exclusion zone. Given this
silence, the Tribunal is guided by Article 58 of the Constitution, which provides that
compensation is payable for loss of an acquired right, the quantum of which is to be
determined “by taking into account the interests of the community and of the individual
concerned.”*!! The Tribunal therefore finds that Article 36 does not prohibit the right to
compensation for the loss of an acquired right to exploit. The Tribunal’s construction is
supported by the statements of the Consejo de Estado in Advisory Opinion 2233, as detailed
above, which indicate that certain compensation may be required to be payable, in respect
of the loss of an acquired right. The Tribunal’s construction ensures Colombian law is
respected but balances any immediate potential harm to the environment by ensuring that
“works” are removed from the area ensuring that the area in the exclusion zone is able to

return to its natural state.

(c) Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code

In undertaking its analysis in Advisory Opinion 2233, the Consejo de Estado also considers

the meaning and effect of Article 46. It notes that “the guarantee of legal stability and respect

for legitimate confidence does not imply a rule prohibiting amendment of current statutes

upon execution of a contract, but rather, it allows the possibility of economic claims in cases

where the conditions of the investment have changed. Put another way, Article 46 of the

Law No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (Exhibit C-8), Art. 36.

Mining Code does not necessarily result in the applicability of the prohibition stipulated by

lawmakers for the protection of paramo ecosystems.”>'\

It is apparent from this language that Article 46 does not have the force of a stabilisation
clause. Nevertheless, it tends to reinforce the Consejo de Estado’s finding that whilst a
subsequent law may lawfully have a retrospective effect on Eco Oro, Eco Oro may retain

the possibility of an economic claim against Colombia.

The Tribunal therefore finds that, pursuant to Article 34, Colombia was permitted to
designate mining exclusion zones provided that the procedure set out therein was complied
with. Article 36 provides that if the area is excluded pursuant to the procedure laid down by
Article 34 then it becomes immediately effective and if existing works have to be removed
this is at the cost of the concessionaire. However, an existing title holder may be entitled to

compensation if it suffers loss of an acquired right.

Having construed the relevant provisions of the 2001 Mining Code, the Tribunal next
considers Laws 1382 and 1450 and Resolution 937. The Tribunal first recalls the
requirements set out in Article 34 which must be complied with before an exclusion zone

can be declared, namely:

a. The act by which the mining exclusion zones areas are declared and delimited must

expressly state that it excludes mining exploration and exploitation works.

b. The exclusion zone must be geographically delimited on the basis of technical,
social and environmental studies (this was the wording in effect at the time the 2007
Atlas was published, the requirement for economic studies not then having been

added);

c. The act by which the exclusion zone is declared must be expressly based on studies

that establish the incompatibility of or need to restrict mining activities; and

480.

481.

d. The delimitation must have been prepared with the collaboration of the mining

authority.

Colombia accepts that the 2001 Mining Code did not expressly create an exclusion zone over
any part of Concession 3452°'? but says that Article 3 of Law 1382 of February 2010 and
MinAmbiente Resolution 937 prohibited all mining in those paramo ecosystems delimited

by the 2007 Atlas.

(d) Law 1382 of 2010

. Ona careful review of Law 1382, it does not seem to the Tribunal that it created a mining

exclusion zone in the area of the 2007 Atlas.

Article 3 of Law 1382 amends Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code such that Article 34
expressly refers to paramo ecosystems as an area which “may” be excluded from mining.
This is consistent with Judgement 933. Article 34 continues by stating that “/¢/he
aforementioned zones will be those that have been constituted or will be established in
accordance with the legal provisions in force.”*'* This suggests that exclusion zones could
have been put in place by the time of the enactment of Law 1382, however, even on
Colombia’s case, as of the date Law 1382 was published no exclusion zone had yet been
created by the 2007 Atlas; Colombia argues that it was only the publication of Law 1382

which achieved this.

Law 1382 provides that such exclusion zones should be areas “geographically delineated by
the Environmental Authority based on technical, social and environmental studies.
The paramo ecosystems shall be identified in accordance with the cartographic information
provided by the [IAvH].” Paragraph 3 of Article 3 further provides that “[t]he declaration
of the exclusion areas referred to in this section requires the Ministry of Mining and

Energy’s prior non-binding opinion.”>!°

Turning first to the requirement that exclusion zones must be delimited on the basis of the
technical, social and environmental studies, Colombia adduced no evidence of any such
studies having been undertaken before 2010. Indeed, Colombia accepts that the 2007 Atlas
was not prepared on the basis of technical, social and environmental studies as such, having
been created as a part of MinAmbiente’s 2002 paramo programme.*!° Colombia argues that
the Article 34 studies were unnecessary as Resolution 937 specifies that the 2007 Atlas was
to be adopted as a minimum reference. The Tribunal turns to Resolution 937 next, but for
the purposes of Law 1382 it seems to the Tribunal that it does not make the 2007 Atlas an
exclusion zone as it was not created in accordance with Law 1382’s requirements.
What Law 1382 does is set out the conditions pursuant to which a mining exclusion zone
can be created; the 2007 Atlas did not of itself comply with those conditions. Further there
is no evidence that any “prior non-binding opinion” had been obtained from MinMinas.

The Tribunal finds, therefore, that Law 1382 did not of itself create a mining exclusion zone.

Given this determination, the Tribunal does not need to consider whether the grandfathering
regime applied to Eco Oro, as no mining exclusion zone had been effected over any area of

Concession 3452.

(e) Resolution 937

The Tribunal next turns to MinAmbiente’s Resolution 937, Article 1 of which adopts the
2007 Atlas “for the identification and delimitation of Paramo Ecosystems.”*'’ Colombia
says the meaning of this is that the 2007 Atlas becomes the delimitation required by Article
34 of the 2001 Mining Code (as amended by Law 1382) which gives the 2007 Atlas the force

of law as a mining exclusion zone.

. The 2007 Atlas clearly identifies and delimits Paramo Ecosystems for certain purposes. The

question is: does the delimitation meet the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining
Code? Article 1 of Resolution 937 does not explicitly state the purpose for which the 2007
Atlas is adopted, indeed it does not state that the identification and delimitation is for the

purposes of complying with the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code or Law

1382. Colombia accepts that the 2007 Atlas was not prepared on the basis of technical,
social and environmental studies, notwithstanding that both Article 34 of the 2001 Mining
Code and Law 1382 expressly require this for any delimitation to be valid. Further,
Resolution 937 makes clear that, to the extent that environmental authorities may have
undertaken their own delimitation in their own jurisdictions (as permitted by Article 1(1)),
such delimitation must be at least as detailed as 1:25,000. This shows the importance of the
delimitation being on a 1:25,000 scale, whereas the 2007 Atlas was on a scale of 1:250,000.
The Tribunal therefore does not accept that the Santurban Péramo became a mining

exclusion zone with the adoption of Resolution 937. Something more was needed.

. Asan aside, whilst the Tribunal does not accept that Resolution 937 has the effect contended

for by Colombia, it must have been clear to all interested parties that the parameters of the
Santurban Paéramo, once delimited in accordance with the law, would not encompass an area
less than that of the 2007 Atlas. The Tribunal so concludes because Article 1(1) of
Resolution 937 further provides that delimitations carried out by the environmental
authorities in their own areas of jurisdiction will be the legally binding delimitation “for all
purposes” provided the cartographic scale used is at least as detailed as 1:25,000 delimitation
with no higher elevation than that defined as the lower altitudinal limit for the ecosystem in
the 2007 Atlas and with an area no less that that contained in the 2007 Atlas. It follows from
this that, with the adoption of Resolution 937, Eco Oro was put on notice as to the future
delimitation of the paramo, and the geographic extent of such delimitation being an area no
less than that contained in the 2007 Atlas, although, as the Tribunal notes below (paras. 698
and 799), there was a lack of clarity as to what was meant by the words “nor is the extent of

the total established area decreased”>'*.

() Law 1450

The Tribunal next turns to Article 202 of Law 1450, adopted on 16 June 2011. Paragraph 1
provides that the paramo ecosystem should be delimited to a scale of 1:25,000 based on
technical, economic, social and environmental studies, the delineation to be adopted by an

administrative act of MinAmbiente or whoever acts in its capacity. Article 201(1) provides,

Ministry of Environment, Resolution No. 937 (25 May 2011) (Exhibit R-70), Art. 1, para. 1.

205/387

489,

inter alia, that no mining activities shall be undertaken on the paramo ecosystems and that,
“for these purposes” the 2007 Atlas will be considered as “a minimum reference” until a
more detailed scale cartography has been obtained. As noted in the previous paragraph,
above, the reference to the area delimited in the 2007 Atlas is not without consequence, albeit

a reference lacking in precision.

. This provision is not easy to construe given the wording of Article 34 and the Tribunal

accepts there is a tension between them. The Tribunal finds the proper construction of this
Article is that it is calling for the requisite delimitation to be undertaken rather than stating
that it has been undertaken by Resolution 937. This is evident from (i) the reference to the
fact the paramo ecosystems “should be” delineated to a 1:25,000 scale, which suggests that,
at that point, a delimitation at that scale had not been conducted (as indeed was the case);
(ii) the wording that the delineation prepared “will be” adopted by MinAmbiente; and
(iii) the fact that at the time this Resolution was passed (25 May 2011) there was no
delimitation at a 1:25,000 scale — the closest was the 2007 Atlas which was not only a
delimitation at a scale of 1:250,000 but had also not been prepared on the basis of technical,

economic, social and environmental studies.

It is also of note that, in Law 1450, there was an addition of economic studies to be
undertaken in determining the delineation of the paramo ecosystems. Again, no evidence
was adduced of any technical, economic, social and environmental studies having been

undertaken.

. Colombia says that the reference to the 2007 Atlas serving as “a minimum reference”

confirms the 2007 Atlas is, for preliminary purposes at least, the mining exclusion zone and
its effect is permanent, at least until a 1:25,000 plan is published. Against this, Eco Oro says
that Article 202(1) merely effects a temporary (or preliminary) suspension of mining within
the 2007 Atlas, pending a lawful delimitation carried out pursuant to the requirements of the
2001 Mining Code (as amended by Law 1382), thus ensuring that no permanent damage can
be caused to a potential area of the paramo ecosystem but which will have no effect once the

1:25,000 plan is published.

206/387

491. The Tribunal does not agree with Colombia’s construction. Article 202(1) can only be

construed such that a temporary suspension of mining activities in the paramo ecosystems
comes into effect as delineated by the 2007 Atlas, which suspension will end once the
required delineation at a scale of 1:25,000 and undertaken on the basis of technical, social
and environmental studies has been published. Paragraph | of Article 202 does not create a
permanent mining ban: it cannot when Colombia itself accepts that the 2007 Atlas does not
meet each of the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code nor those of Article 3
of Law 1382. These requirements are essential to ensure any final delimitation is as
reasonably accurate as possible to ensure that a proper balance is achieved between on the
one hand protecting the paramo ecosystem and on the other protecting the livelihoods of
those who work or live in areas which fall within the 2007 Atlas but may not fall within a
delimitation undertaken in accordance with Article 34 and Law 1450. Clearly a delimitation
at a scale of 1:250,000 will be less accurate than a delimitation at a scale of 1:25,000 and
Colombia accepts there are errors in the 2007 Atlas which would be corrected by a more
detailed delimitation. By way of example only, Colombia accepts that the 2007 Atlas had a

potential margin of error of between 100-150 meters in altitude*!?

which could be significant
in terms of determining the parameters of the mining exclusion ban and the extent of the
overlap with Concession 3452. Indeed, on Eco Oro’s case, in a mountainous area such as
where the Angostura Deposit is located, this altitudinal shift could result in a shift of up to
250 meters in the Resolution 2090 delimitation boundary such that almost all of the
Angostura deposit might end up outside the Preservation Zone.*”° This construction is
supported by the text of Resolution VSC 4, which confirms “[...] the delimitation of the
paramo ecosystem based on the [2007 Atlas] is temporary until the competent environmental
authority creates the final delimitation at a scale of 1:25,000 after carrying out the technical,
economic, social and environmental studies referred to in Article 202 of Law No. 1450

of 2011.” [Tribunal’s emphasis]

Colombia accepted there was a 5-13.9% margin of error in determining where the boundary should lie and the
margin of error could be as much as 150 meters in altitude in certain areas, because the “quality of the
information has limitations.” Respondent’s Rejoinder, paras. 257-258.

493.

S21

subject only to a temporary (or provisional) mining ban: there is no permanent mining
exclusion zone over Concession 3452, just a mandatory suspension of mining activities
pending the final delimitation of the Santurban Paramo in accordance with all applicable
tules at the time such delimitation is completed. This is the position under Law 1382 and
this temporary suspension of mining activities continued as a result of the two-year
suspension of the effect of the overturning of Law 1382. In this regard, the Tribunal notes
that the reason for Law 1382 being overturned was its unconstitutionality for failure to
consult, which tends to support the conclusion that, as at that date, no final delimitation had
been carried out in accordance with the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code.
Before the two year’s suspension had expired, Law 1450 was published which, as the

Tribunal has determined above, had the same suspensive effect.

The Tribunal’s construction is further supported by the Constitutional Court which, in 2017,

stated:

“ijn the case at hand, under Laws No. 1450 of 2010 and 1382 of 2011, the
Lawmaker prohibited mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation
projects and activities in areas delimited as paramos. Furthermore, it
imposed on the Ministry of the Environment and Social Development the
obligation to make progress on the delimitation of paramos. However, the
only paramo delimited when the prohibition was in place Santurbén by
way of Resolution No. 2090 of Di ber 19, 2014. Therefore, even if the
administrative acts whereby the environmental licenses and permits, and
concession agreements, were granted remained valid, they had been deprived
of their legal basis, as the Lawmaker placed limits on the private persons’
freedom to carry out mining and hydrocarbon activities in paramos.” *!

494,

“Particularly, although pdramos are ecosystems that, pursuant to the law,
call for special protection, they are not protected areas per se, since the
‘protected area’ category is tied to_a declaratory and_impl

 

 

 

procedure by the envir ! authorities. In other words, although these
ecosystems have been identified as areas that require special protection, no
category of specific or ic protection has been regulated for such

 

 

biomes. To that extent, at present there are paramo areas that have been
declared to_be protected areas and others that have not.”*” [Tribunal’s
emphasis]

“[W]e may conclude that, although there is a definition of paramo _and the
obligation to delimit it, determining the scope of protection is effected through
such administrative acts as decided upon by the Ministry of the Environment
and Sustainable Development on demarcating paramo areas.” * [Tribunal’s
emphasis]

 

In support of its construction of Law 1382, Resolution 937 and Law 1450, Colombia refers
to Advisory Opinion 2233 and, in particular, the following statement which, on first review,
appears contradictory to the statement of the Constitutional Court: “Although Act 1382 of
2010 was only in force for a short period of time, the fact is that the deferred effect of its
declaration of unconstitutionality allowed the exclusion of paramos from mining activity to
continue over time, as it was later included in the general prohibition of Act 1345 of 2011
that we are now dealing with. Put differently, with respect to mining activities, the ban on
undertaking them in the paramo ecosystems has been operative since February 9, 2010.”>*4

[Tribunal’s emphasis]

. In the Tribunal’s view, these two statements can be reconciled. In its judgment, the

Constitutional Court is determining, inter alia, the actual date on which any specific mining
ban came into force. Whilst the Consejo de Estado makes a general statement of the
importance of protecting the paramos, the focus of its opinion is on considering the effect of
a mining ban on “persons and companies who were validly carrying out mining and

agricultural activities in paramo zones prior to the Act’s passage.” Given the “Act” that the

Consejo de Estado is referring to is Law 1450 (which was passed in 2011), when the Consejo
de Estado refers to mining having been prohibited in paramo ecosystems pursuant to the
2001 Mining Code and Law 1382, it is effectively confirming that there is the power to
exclude mining from areas where paramo ecosystems have been declared pursuant to the
legal requirements contained in the 2001 Mining Code and Law 1382. The same must
therefore be so with respect to Law 1450, such that it does not of itself bring in a permanent
mining ban but ensures a suspension of mining pending a final delimitation in accordance
with the law. Indeed, in defining the problem, the Consejo de Estado says, in paragraph 1,
that Section 202 of Law 1450 “orders the delimitation of the country’s paramo ecosystems
and prohibits the undertaking of mining and agricultural activities within them.” This is
consistent with a construction that Law 1450 does indeed (i) order that mining is finally
prohibited within the paramo ecosystems, once finally delimited and (ii) ensures that the
condition of the paramo ecosystems is not adversely affected pending delimitation, by

suspending mining within the 2007 Atlas pending such final legal delimitation.

. In summary, the Tribunal understands Advisory Opinion 2233 to explain that, once a final

delimitation has been undertaken in compliance with the requirements of Article 34
(as amended), a permanent mining ban becomes immediately effective and enforceable in

the delimited area.*75

Thus, the enactment of Law 1382 provided for the immediate
applicability of a ban on any area once, but only once, it was lawfully declared as a paramo
ecosystem in compliance with Article 34. If legitimately declared, such a ban would be
continued by Law 1450 without a break. However, as the Santurban Paramo had not been
finally delimited in accordance with Article 34, Laws 1382 and 1450 did not create any
permanent mining ban in Concession 3452. In other words, the term “paramo ecosystems”
is being used as short-hand for areas which are to be permanently excluded from mining
once delimitation has been lawfully undertaken, i.e., in compliance with the requirements
contained in the 2001 Mining Code and repeated in Law 1450. Until this happens, mining

is suspended, but this is not the same as a permanent ban.

499,

The Constitutional Court confirms this construction in Judgement C-35 stating that the
Santurban Paramo was the only paramo that had been delimited but that such delimitation

took place only by Resolution 2090 on 19 December 2014.°°

The Tribunal takes comfort that its construction is correct from the contemporaneous
understanding of both MinMinas and MinAmbiente as well as other Government bodies.
For example, MinMinas wrote to INGEOMINAS stating that whilst the 2007 Atlas was to
be used as a reference it did not itself establish mining exclusion zones.°”’ Further, when
Eco Oro’s application for an environmental licence for its open-cast mine was rejected in
Resolution 1015, detailed technical reasons were provided rather than a simple statement
that the mining activities planned were banned because they were intended to be carried out
ina delineated paramo ecosystem.*** The latter would have been far simpler and the obvious
thing to say had there been a mining exclusion zone in place. Again, ANLA confirmed in
Resolution 35 dated 31 October 2011 that no mining exclusion zone had been permanently
declared in the paramo ecosystem. The ANM Resolution VSC 4 noted that it was
“undeniable” that at that point Article 202 of Law 1450 had not been developed such that
there was not a more detailed map than the 2007 Atlas at 1:250,000 and that therefore the
“legal status” of the area in Concession 3452 was “uncertain because it cannot be said with
complete certainty, due to the absence of technical parameters, that it is located within the
paramo.” The effect was that exploratory activities continued to be suspended “wntil the
Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development or the entity acting in its capacity

issues the final delimitation to a scale of 1:25,000.”

The Tribunal therefore finds that as at the date of entry into force of the FTA, whilst mining
activities had been suspended, there was no mining exclusion zone in force over any part of
Concession 3452 and Eco Oro had acquired rights to explore in the totality of
Concession 3452 (Article 58 of the 2001 Mining Code and Clause 4 of the Concession 3452).
The majority of the Tribunal finds that Eco Oro had acquired rights to exploit in the totality

D. WHETHER COLOMBIA UNLAWFULLY EXPROPRIATED ECO ORO’S INVESTMENT.

501.

(1) The Parties’ Positions
(a) The Claimant’s Position

Article 811 provides for indirect expropriation. It is uncontroversial that contractual rights
may be indirectly expropriated,*”° seizure of title is not required and the measures do not
need explicitly to express the purpose of deprivation of rights or assets, provided they have
“a devastating effect on the economic viability” of the project and cause the claimant to
“incur unsustainable losses”>*® depriving the investor substantially of the use, value and
enjoyment of its investment. Thus “[...] a measure or series of measures can still eventually

amount to a taking, though the individual steps in the process do not formally purport to

531

amount to a taking or to a transfer of title. “The last step in a creeping expropriation

that tilts the balance is similar to the straw that breaks the camel’s back. The preceding
straws may not have had a perceptible effect but are part of the process that led to the
break.”**? Intent is not a prerequisite, the issue is the effect of the measures in question.**
The form and purpose of the measures is irrelevant, the question being whether the measures

are or are not expropriatory.

The measures in question comprise the totality of the events commencing with Resolution
2090 and concluding with the deprivation created by Resolution VSC 829 (the “Challenged
Measures”). Colombia indirectly expropriated Eco Oro’s entire investment in Colombia,
the date of expropriation being 8 August 2016 when Resolution VSC 829 was issued by the
ANM advising that, pursuant to Judgement C-35 of the Constitutional Court, it was only
extending Concession 3452 for the areas that fell outside the Santurban Paramo as delimited
by Resolution 2090. The Challenged Measures deprived Eco Oro substantially of the use,
value and enjoyment of Concession 3452. Colombia disputes this saying its actions, having

been taken for the protection of the environment, do not constitute expropriation.

(i) The Nature of the Assets Expropriated

Eco Oro’s rights to undertake exploitation activities in the totality of Concession 3452,°*“ as
well as the right to extend the term of the Concession were expropriated, both rights being

acquired rights.

(ii) The Challenged Measures

The key events are as follows.

a. Resolution 2090

Resolution 2090 is an administrative act. Article 1 provided for delimitation of the

Santurban Paramo “in accordance with the technical, economic, social and environmental

Whilst during the oral hearing there was some debate as to whether the rights Eco Oro asserts it held at the
time of the expropriating measures consisted of the right to exploit, the exercise of which was subject to
fulfilling the necessary legal requirements or whether it was more limited, being the right to apply for an
environmental licence to enable it to undertake exploitation activities, in its Post-Hearing Brief (paragraph 3),
Eco Oro confirmed it asserted it had a right to exploit, which right was expropriated.

studies conducted by the [(CDMB and CORPONOR| and the contributions of the [[AvVH]”>*>
(a 2014 document titled “Contributions to the delimitation of the paramo through
identification of lower limits of the ecosystem at a 1:25,000 scale and analysis of the social
system of the territory”*® (the “Contributions Document”) as cartographically represented
on the map attached to the Resolution which was on a scale of 1:25,000 and was stated to be

an integral part thereof (“2090 Atlas”).

Resolution 2090 did not “confirm” the 2007 Atlas delimitation. Ms. Baptiste confirmed that
to delineate the paramos, the [AvH was required to prepare a new set of criteria and adequate
methodology which differed from those used to prepare the 2007 Atlas.**” The delimitation
was eight times larger than Santurban Park, whereas previous indications (including from
Ms. Baptiste***) had been that the boundaries of the area delimited by Resolution 2090 would
be similar to those of Santurban Park. Further, the Santurban Paramo delineated at a
1:25,000 scale by the IAVH is approximately 56% larger than the total area identified in the
2007 Atlas and the total paramo area in Colombia under the 2012 Atlas*° was 47% larger
than that in the 2007 Atlas.*#° Pursuant to Resolution 2090, 50.7% of Concession 3452
overlapped with the preservation area, a further 3.9% overlapped with the restoration area
and 32% of the Angostura deposit overlapped with the preservation area and 28% overlapped

with the restoration area.

Resolution 2090 had limited impact on Eco Oro as Article 9 permitted mining activities in
the restoration zone located, inter alia, in the municipality of California where Concession
3452 is located, subject to compliance with mining and environmental regulations and
Eco Oro’s rights were grandfathered by Article 5°“! as Eco Oro’s PMA is an equivalent
environmental management and control instrument. However, Article 5 deprived Eco Oro

of its right to extend its concession beyond its initial term curtailing Eco Oro’s rights,

although this still gave sufficient time to pursue a viable Project.*#* Further, Article 5’s
provision that the existing environmental licenses or equivalent environmental management
and control instruments “may be subject to revision and adjustments” and further that
regional and environmental bodies “shall define more detailed guidelines, in the context of
zoning and the determination of uses regulation, as well as in the corresponding
environmental control and management documents” created uncertainty; it was unclear what
these detailed guidelines and documents would consist of and thus to what extent they would
impact on mine planning or how PMAs of grandfathered projects would be amended and

whether they would be made stricter.

b. Law 1753

Eco Oro again benefitted from the grandfathering provisions in Article 173 of Law 1753°%
because Concession 3452 and the PMA both pre-dated 9 February 2010. This meant that
Eco Oro’s mining activities, including exploration and exploitation, could continue
throughout its Concession area as the transitional regime did not only apply to exploitation
activities. Whilst Law 1382 expressly exempted “construction assembly or exploitation
activities”, Resolution 2090 did not contain such language, instead referring to “mining
activities that have concession contracts [...] as well as [...] equivalent environmental

management and control instrument.”**+

The rights to explore and to exploit are indivisible
and, in any event, Law 1753 expressly refers to exploration as well as exploitation activities.
The grandfathering regime in Law 1753 therefore allowed Eco Oro to continue carrying out
those activities it was permitted to do pursuant to its Concession and PMA which was the
right to explore and exploit up to the end of the Concession (subject to obtaining an
environmental licence), it is grandfathering the existing Concession irrespective of the stage

of activity the concessionaire has reached.

Colombia is also wrong to say that an “equivalent environmental management and control
instrument” is a reference to an environmental licence — given the words immediately follow

after the reference to an environmental licence that would render the term duplicative and

deprive it of any legal effect (effet utile).**° An “equivalent environmental management and
control instrument” is not an environmental licence but another different instrument.
Given MinAmbiente Decree 2041 of 2014 (enacted just two months before Resolution 2090
was published) defines PMAs as an “environmental management and control instrument”**°
it is clear that the reference in Resolution 2090 to an “equivalent environmental management

and control instrument” is a reference to a PMA.

Eco Oro’s updated PMA was submitted in 2008 after integration of the mining titles and was
associated with Concession 3452 (not Permit 3452 as was the position with the original
PMA) and has been used by the CDMB to monitor Eco Oro’s activities since submission. It
is clearly therefore an equivalent “environmental management and control instrument” for

the purpose of the grandfathering regime.

. The fact the Project was grandfathered is also evident from Colombia’s acts (i) in lifting the

suspension of Eco Oro’s mining activities in all areas of the concession without any reference
to any applicable mining restrictions in the concession area; (ii) the ANLA indicating that
an underground mine could be licensed;*4” (iii) calculating Eco Oro’s canon payments in
relation to the entirety of the area; (iv) only reducing the area over which the canon payments
were calculated 18 months after Resolution 2090 was issued once judgement C-35 had been
published; (v) appointing a PINE official to look after the Project because it was “the ‘VIP’
Project in the nation’; and (vi) the President’s Minister and advisors telling an IFC
representative in a meeting that “ANZA was willing to evaluate the underground project

under the paramo ecosystem [...].”

If it is determined that the grandfathering regime did not apply to Eco Oro, this does not
mean there was no indirect expropriation, it is just a timing issue and the effect is that the

expropriation took place when Resolution 2090 was issued, rather than subsequently upon

Eco Oro notes that this principle is recognised under Colombian law — Constitutional Court Judgement

the issuance of Resolution VSC 829, which effectively applied Resolution 2090 to Eco Oro

without the benefit of the grandfathering provision.

Whilst Ms. Baptiste says in her testimony that the Resolution 2090 delimitation has not been
criticised, this is incorrect.*#* After publication of this delimitation, the IAvH accepted there
could be a margin of error of 100 meters in altitude**? (it is unknown how this margin of
error was determined as annex 8 in which this evaluation was carried out and in which it was
reflected was not produced despite Colombia being ordered so to do). MinAmbiente
estimated the margin of error to be even greater, as much as 150 meters in altitude in certain
areas, because the “quality of information has limitations”, noting that further field studies
should have been carried out to verify the information.*°° Given that where the Angostura
Deposit is located is mountainous, this altitudinal shift could result in a shift of up to 250
meters in the Resolution 2090 delimitation boundary such that almost all of the Angostura
deposit would be outside the Preservation Zone. Additionally, the town of Vetas and certain
densely populated areas of the municipality of Berlin fell within the delimited zone.
MinAmbiente acknowledged that certain such areas should be removed from the Resolution
2090 delimitation®>! but no amendments were made. The CDMB also recommended

amendments to it**

(having undertaken the delimitation of Santurban Park two years before)
but again no amendments were made. Even the Constitutional Court noted that
MinAmbiente may modify the delimitation on the basis that various participants had warned

of errors in the delimitation.**

c. Judgment C-35

Further uncertainty was created when the Constitutional Court first announced and then

published Judgment C-35.*** Whilst the grandfathering provisions in Law 1753 were struck

down by this judgment, it didn’t strike down the equivalent provisions in Resolution 2090.
Judgment C-35 also provided that those provisions in Article 173 of Law 1753 which
allowed MinAmbiente to deviate from the mapping carried out by the IAVH on the basis of
criteria other than scientific (i.e., social and economic) were unconstitutional and the
Ministry could only deviate if it could scientifically demonstrate that doing so would provide
a higher degree of protection to the paramo.*°> This raised concern that the delimitation in
Resolution 2090 would also be struck down as unconstitutional since social and economic
criteria had not been taken into account; indeed there was a challenge pending before the
Constitutional Court. Additional uncertainty was created by the Constitutional Court raising

concerns, obiter dicta, about underground mining in paramo areas.

Mines noted the uncertainty which had been caused by this judgement and the CDMB
explained to Eco Oro in a meeting on 21 November 2016 that these uncertainties prevented
it from processing a request for an environmental licence. The ANM characterised the

judgement as “radical” and “an absolute interference with contractual rights and effects,

from a mining point of view, contracts executed, and investments made, under the

regulations in force at the time, which could potentially cause unlawful damages to those
who, on the basis of the contract, and legitimate expectations, carried out investments which
could be deemed to have been indirectly expropriated, as a consequence of the
unconstitutionality decision. Evidently, this situation raises national and international
concerns in light of investment protection treaties [...].”*°* This uncertainty brought the

project development to a standstill.**?

d. Resolution 829

Resolution 829 was issued by the ANM and extended the exploration phase for a further two
years but only over the area which did not overlap the Preservation Zone pursuant to

Judgment C-35.

Eco Oro was therefore not deprived of its rights in relation to 50.73% of Concession 3452
until (i) the ANM’s letter to Eco Oro on 26 July 2016, requesting payment of the surface
canon calculated only on the 49.27% of the area Concession 3452 which did not overlap
with the Preservation Zone because that overlapping area was excluded from mining
pursuant to its letter dated 19 May 2016°° (which cited Judgement C-35); and (ii) the
notification from the ANM on 8 August 2016 that it had decided, in Resolution VSC 829,
only to extend the exploration phase (as requested by Eco Oro) in respect of that area of the
Concession which did not overlap with the Preservation Zone of the 2090 Delimitation,

i.e., 49.27%.

Resolution 829 was not, as argued by Colombia, mere clarification that mining was not
permitted in the concession area that overlapped with the paramo but was issued as a
consequence of Judgement C-35. This can be seen from the following: “paramo ecosystems
must be excluded from mining activities by the operation of law, including those carried out
pursuant to concession contracts that have already been granted and that are
environmentally feasible, as indicated by the Honourable Constitutional Court in the
constitutionality analysis carried out in judgement C-035 of 2016.” The reference to
“concession contracts that have already been granted and that are environmentally feasible”

is a reference to grandfathered concession contracts.

Although pursuant to Resolution 829 it was clear mining would not be permitted in the
Preservation Zone, there was considerable uncertainty as to what would be permitted in the
Restoration Zone. This uncertainty was exacerbated when Eco Oro received Resolution 48
from the ANM (on 20 September 2016) which was in respect of another of its titles but

which granted an extension over the entire concession area, notwithstanding that the area of

561

562

that concession overlapped with both the Preservation Zone and Restoration Zone but which
further stated that mining activities were prohibited in both of these zones. The uncertainty
continued when the Director General of the CDMB advised Eco Oro that it was unclear
whether mining would be permitted in the Restoration Zone.*°! 27.6% of the Angostura

Deposit overlapped with the Restoration Zone.

This uncertainty also extended to the balance of Concession 3452 that did not overlap with
either the Preservation Zone or Restoration Zone. The pending Constitutional Court
challenge to Resolution 2090 and the 2090 Delimitation raised concerns that the
MinAmbiente could be required to re-delimit the paramo such that it encroached further into
Concession 3452. There was clear confusion within the ANM (as evidenced by the ANM’s
technical report VSC 3) and the Director General of the CDMB advised Eco Oro that the
CDMB would not be able to process any application for an environmental licence relating

to Concession 3452 until the uncertainties were lifted.°

It is clear from the following that Eco Oro had not been deprived of its mining rights before

Resolution 829:

a. The ANM would not have needed to refer to grandfathered concession contracts in

Resolution 829;

b. The ANM would not have extended the exploration phase over the entire

concession area in both August 2012 and 2014;

c. Surface canons would not have been charged over the entire area in 2012 to 2015;
in September 2015 the 2090 Delimitation had already been completed such that
Judgment C-35 was the only intervening act between then and the ANM seeking

surface canons over only 49.27%; and

d. The suspension of mining activities in Resolution VSC 4 would not have been lifted

in January 2015, after the Resolution 2090 delimitation.

524,

In further support of Eco Oro’s argument that it was only deprived of its mining rights by
Resolution 829, it is clear from the CIIPE minutes of August 2016 that it was only upon
receipt of Resolution 829 that Eco Oro learnt of its deprivation and that this deprivation was
as a result of the declaration of the unconstitutionality of the grandfathering provision in
Article 173(1) of Law 1753.° The confusion as to whether the effect of Judgement C-35
was that mining was just banned in the Preservation Zone or whether it also extended to the
Restoration Zone must also have been shared by CIIPE given the reference in the minutes to
the loss of 60% of the area of Concession 3452 which corresponds to the overlap with both
Zones. There was further uncertainty as to whether a buffer zone would be imposed further
reducing the available area in which mining would be permitted or whether mining to the

border of the 2090 Delimitation would be allowed.

Whilst Eco Oro sought to maintain the status quo after this indirect expropriation to preserve
the possibility of future mitigation, the uncertainty never lifted and the further measures
undertaken by Colombia between 2017 and 2019 thwarted its mitigation efforts. Indeed,
Eco Oro had been hopeful that the remaining area of Concession 3452 had value to Minesa,
a mining company whose concession was landlocked within Concession 3452 and which
required the building of tunnels located within the non-overlapping portion of Concession
3452, such tunnels being indispensable to Minesa’s project. However, this possibility of
mitigating its losses was thwarted by the ANM granting to Minesa the right to tunnel through

Concession 3452 without regard to Eco Oro’s rights.

Colombia’s denial of any further extension to file the PTO led to the expiration of the
exploration phase of Concession 3452 and Eco Oro therefore had no alternative but to
renounce the Concession in further mitigation of its losses, including the need to avoid the
continuing costs associated with maintaining and securing the mine site and avoiding the
declaration of forfeiture which could impede the completion of the sale and transfer of

certain of its other mining titles to Minesa.

564

Eco Oro was therefore deprived of the value or control of its investment. The fact it retained
the ability to mine just under half of the area of Concession 3452 is irrelevant as the loss in
resources in the area lost to delimitation destroyed the economics of the project.*°* Further,
the uncertainty as to the extent of Eco Oro’s rights to the remaining area which did not
overlap with the Santurbén Paramo as then delimited (some of which overlapped with the
Restoration Zone and some of which were not covered by the Resolution 2090 delimitation)
rendered any remaining rights Eco Oro may have had valueless. There was considerable
uncertainty as to the ability to mine in the Restoration Zone (and this encompassed 27.6%
of Concession 3452’s area) and it was further unclear whether any re-delimitation would
encroach yet further into the non-overlapping areas of Concession 3452. Eco Oro’s Terms
of Reference obtained in 2011 are irrelevant to evaluating the uncertainty caused by
Colombia’s measures in 2016 and beyond. Whilst Eco Oro sought to maintain the status quo
so as to preserve the possibility of mitigating its losses should the position become clearer,
Colombia ultimately caused the expiration of the exploration phase leaving Eco Oro no

option but to renounce its right to Concession 3452 in a further attempt to mitigate its losses.

(iii) Effect of the expropriating measures
Eco Oro was deprived of its rights under Concession 3452 by an arbitrary delimitation
—Resolution 829 deprived Eco Oro of over 50% of the area of Concession 3452 which
overlapped the Preservation Zone as delimited by Resolution 2090 and this loss of resources,
coupled with the crippling uncertainty as to what could be achieved with the remaining area
of the concession, destroyed the economic viability of the Project. But for the deprivation
of its rights, Eco Oro would have produced an EIA showing that its mining project could

have been carried out in an environmentally respectful way.

a. The FTA Does Not Establish the Primacy of Environmental
Protection Over Trade and Investment

As a preliminary point, Colombia’s contention that the State parties agreed to subordinate
investment protection to environmental preservation in the FTA is wrong. Both ideals are

mutually supportive, neither is subordinated to the other. They must be applied consistently.

First Moseley-Williams Statement, para. 59.

222/387

528.

529.

530.

566

Eco Oro does not seek restitution but compensation for measures taken by Colombia as the
measures taken were not for a legitimate purpose. This “is a fair outcome that preserves a
broad discretion for Colombia to regulate the environment whilst affording reparation in

connection with the destruction of the acquired rights of Eco Oro.”>*

Colombia’s argument that legitimate expectations that arose before the entry into force of
the FTA are not protected by Article 801 and Annex 811(2) is also wrong. Article 801(2)
precludes any action arising out of a State measure that pre-dates the entry into force of the
FTA (the action that frustrates the legitimate expectations), it does not preclude reliance on
legitimate expectations formed before the FTA entered into force. This is clear from the
definition of “covered investment” in Article 838 of the FTA which includes within the scope

of the Treaty’s protection investments which existed on the date the FTA entered into force.

b. Annex 811(2)

Colombia’s action on 8 August 2016 had “an effect equivalent to direct expropriation.”
Whilst it is correct that the Preservation Zone of the Santurban Paramo only overlapped
with 50.73% of the area of Concession 3452 and 32.4% of the Angostura Deposit,
the economic effect of this was to destroy the viability of the Project.*°° According to Eco
Oro’s mining experts, Behre Dolbear, having considered three similar properties located
immediately adjacent to the Angostura Project which were sold between 2011 and 2012, the
Angostura Project had considerable market value prior to the measures. They value it at
USD 696 million as of 8 August 2016. They further opine that there is no basis to assess the
current actual value such that the loss to Eco Oro is 100% of the fair market value of the

project. The value of Concession 3452 has thus been eviscerated.

It was also impossible for Eco Oro to pursue the Project in the light of the many
legal uncertainties (summarised above) surrounding the extent or existence of Eco Oro’s

rights in those parts of Concession 3452 which did not overlap the Santurban Paramo

as delimited in the 2090 Delimitation.’ This rendered any remaining rights to

Concession 3452 valueless.**

Eco Oro’s rights were therefore indirectly expropriated applying the factors detailed in

Annex 811(2)(a).
Colombia is incorrect to argue that its measures are excused by Annex 811(2)(b).

For this Annex even to apply, the measure in question must relate to the protection of the

environment. Hence the following measures do not come within Annex 811(2)(b):

a. The ANM’s refusal on 22 August 2017 to suspend Eco Oro’s obligations in light
of the uncertainties surrounding the Project and its rejection of Eco Oro’s appeal;

and
b. The ANM’s March 2019 deadline to submit a PMA.

The remaining measures are “rare circumstances” such that they constitute indirect

expropriation for which compensation is payable.

Sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of Annex 811 are interpretative aids describing the circumstances
in which an indirect expropriation arises and they are to be read together: sub-paragraph (a)
contains a non-exhaustive list of “factors” to be “considered” as part of a “case-by-case, fact
based inquiry” to determine whether the measures constitute an indirect expropriation.
These “factors” are not strict conditions to finding an indirect expropriation, but part of a
holistic analysis, as is clear from the wording that the factors are to be “consider[ed]”; there
is no provision that they are determinative. Sub-paragraph (b) contains further guidance for
the inquiry initiated by sub-paragraph (a) by clarifying the types of measures that will not
constitute indirect expropriation. A measure that is adopted in good faith, is non-
discriminatory and is designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives
will not be expropriatory; the three requirements are cumulative (reflecting the latter part of

the sub-clause, (the “811(2)(b) Rule”). The first part of the sub-clause provides an exception

to this rule such that it does not apply where there are “rare circumstances” (the “811(2)(b)
Exceptions”) and provides a non-exhaustive illustrative example of such a “rare

circumstance.”

Colombia’s construction, which requires mutually exclusive analysis of the two sub-
paragraphs, does not comport with the ordinary meaning of the text of these two sub-
paragraphs. Firstly, the “economic impact’ of a measure is a factor listed in sub-
paragraph (a), however, in considering the severity of the measure to determine its
proportionality pursuant to sub-paragraph (b), it is necessary to consider its economic
impact. Again, sub-paragraph (a) lists the “character” of a measure as a factor however, to
determine under sub-paragraph (b) whether that measure is “non-discriminatory” and the
manner in which it is “designed and applied”, it is necessary to consider its character.
The two sub-paragraphs are thus clearly to be considered in one joint, coterminous analysis.
This is further demonstrated by the fact that the two sub-paragraphs consist of one long
sentence joined together by a semi-colon. Further to this analysis, Eco Oro’s contentions
with regard to the Annex 811(2)(a) factors is included in its submissions with respect to

whether the measures were a valid exercise of Colombia’s police powers.

Annex 811(2)(b) is a codification of, and reflects, the customary international law doctrine

of police powers, as was noted by the tribunal in Philip Morris v. Uruguay>®

referring to the
Canadian Model BIT whose provision is virtually identical to the sub-clause and as
confirmed by Canada in Lone Pine v. Canada.*”° This doctrine is not absolute: to meet the
threshold of non-compensable and non-expropriatory government action, there are “a

number of conditions that a measure has to comply with, including non-discrimination, good

faith, non-arbitrariness and proportionality.”*"'

Even if Annex 811(2)(b) does not reflect the customary international law doctrine of police
powers, the position is still the same: those circumstances that give rise to exceptions to the
police powers doctrine, such as measures that frustrate legitimate expectations or are not
bona fide, reasonable or proportionate, or are arbitrary, capricious or otherwise not taken in
good faith, would also qualify as “rare circumstances” under the ordinary meaning of Annex

811(2)(b).

The example of an 811(2)(b) Exception in Annex 811(2)(b) is purely illustrative (“when a
measure is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having
been adopted in good faith”). Colombia is wrong to term this a “severe and bad faith
regulation”,*”? what is required is an assessment of proportionality: when is a measure or
series of measures so severe in the light of its purpose? This analysis enables a determination
of whether a measure can “be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith” this
is the additive, aggravating element that makes a measure that would otherwise be covered
by the 811(2)(b) Rule qualify as an 811(2)(b) Exception and is the factor that makes the
circumstances “rare.” Annex 811(2)(b) does not mandate the finding of bad faith nor of
severity and, as is clear from the inclusion in the provision of the words “such as”, other
measures that “cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith” for
reasons other than disproportionality must also qualify as an exception to Annex 811(2)(b).
To argue that the only measures that can qualify as 811(2)(b) Exceptions are those that
cannot be reasonably be viewed as having been adopted in good faith for reasons of

disproportionality (and not for any other reasons) is nonsensical and would render the words

“such as” in Annex 811(2)(b) devoid of meaning

The criterion that measures must be adopted in good faith aligns with the police powers
requirement that the measure is bona fide. As well as being enshrined in the text of Annex

811, good faith is a fundamental principle of international law.

The principle of good faith has various manifestations when considering the manner in which
States are to treat foreign investors but in summary encompass a State’s obligation not to act

in a way that frustrates an investor’s legitimate expectations, to ensure regulatory

transparency with no arbitrariness or capricious in discretionary decision-making, of
fairness, clarity, non-ambiguity and predictability.°”> Whilst the reference cited from the
Oxford Handbook on International Investment Law is in relation to fair and equitable
treatment, the international law treatment of good faith is imported into the police powers
doctrine by the express reference in Annex 811(2)(b) to the requirement that a measure be
taken in good faith such that the analysis to be undertaken is the same whether being
conducted with respect to the ability to rely on the police powers exception or a minimum
standard of treatment analysis.*”* Indeed, Annex 811(2)(a) expressly refers to reasonable
investment-backed expectations as one of the three specified factors to take into account

when considering whether there has been indirect expropriation.

When good faith is assessed for the purposes of the police powers exception in Annex
811(2)(b) (as the express wording of the sub-clause requires), it is necessary to understand
what is meant by good faith in international law and it includes the failure to respect an
investor’s legitimate expectation; this is part and parcel of what is considered good faith and
thus the failure to respect an investor’s legitimate expectation forms a part of any assessment

as to the relevance of Annex 811(2)(b).

In summary, Colombia’s measures fall within the three 811(2)(b) Exceptions, each of which
independently renders Colombia’s measures compensable. They frustrated Eco Oro’s
legitimate expectations; are arbitrary and disproportionate; and resulted in a non-transparent
and unpredictable regulatory regime or were not otherwise implemented in good faith.
Colombia is therefore obliged to compensate Eco Oro for these measures which expropriated

its mining rights.

(iv) Eco Oro’s legitimate expectations

An expectation is legitimate when premised on “assurances explicit or implicit, or on
representations made by the State”*”> and such expectations must have been formed at the
time the investment was made or, where the investment is made through several steps,
“legitimate expectations must be examined for each stage at which a decisive step is taken
towards the creation, expansion, development, or reorganisation of the investment.”>"
Whilst a foreign investor may recognize a host State’s right to regulate, it would expect to

restricting mining activities in areas of Concession 3452 delimited by Resolution 2090 as
paramo were in breach of specific commitments made by the Government on which Eco Oro

had a right to rely.

The legitimate expectations formed by Eco Oro derived directly from: (i) Decree 2477 of
1986; (ii) the 1998 Mining Code which applied to Permit 3452; (iii) Permit 3452 itself which,
on its face, contained an express acknowledgement from MinMinas that the area covered by
the permit was not subject to any particular environmental delimitation; (iv) the 2001 Mining
Code, pursuant to which Eco Oro’s mining titles were integrated into Concession 3452; and

(v) the Colombian law doctrine of confianza legitima (legitimate expectations).

Of the ten titles integrated into Concession 3452, eight were exploitation titles which
represented 92% of the Angostura Deposit, the owners of which had carried out extraction
activities such that there was an expectation such activities could continue. The 1988 Mining
Code applied when Eco Oro bought these titles and it provided that “permits and licenses
granted by means of a duly executed resolution, that remain in force and valid at the date of

enacting of this Code” constitute acquired rights.*”* Whilst Article 10 excluded certain areas

from mining, Article 9 provided that any areas indicated as prohibited to mining “does not
affect previously issued titles, whilst they remain valid.” These acquired rights gave Eco Oro
the expectation it would have the right to mine (including the right to exploit) in the entirety
of the area granted under each title, subject only to those areas excluded at the time the title
was issued and to complying with the applicable regulatory and licensing requirements. As
a result of these expectations, Eco Oro commenced its investment in Colombia by carrying

out exploration works and acquiring additional mining titles.

Although Eco Oro’s ten titles were consolidated into Concession 3452 pursuant to the 2001
Mining Code, that did not extinguish the constitutive rights associated with and acquired
from the underlying mining permits. Instead, Eco Oro obtained additional acquired rights
based on the terms of Concession 3452. Colombia is wrong to say that there was no basis
for Eco Oro to have had an expectation it would be permitted to conduct exploitation
activities over the entire area of the Concession —Clause One explicitly provided that the
sole purpose of the Concession agreement was exploitation such that Eco Oro would have

rights over the entirety of the Concession area.

Section 46 of the 2001 Mining Code further stabilised the legal framework applicable to
mining projects. This applies to the provisions of the 2001 Mining Code and all norms
specifically aimed at mining activities, including environmental norms. As provided by
Advisory Opinion 2233, whilst Article 46 did not preclude the authorities from restricting
rights to carry out mining activities in the paramo ecosystems, compensation could

be payable.°”

None of the prior laws such as the Environmental Law, those efforts commencing in 2002
for the protection of paramo ecosystems and the 2007 Atlas amounted to a restriction on
mining activities in the area of Concession 3452. If they had, Eco Oro would not have been
granted Concession 3452. Eco Oro legitimately formed expectations based on Clause One

of Concession 3452 and Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code.

Whilst the licensing regime may have been exacting, Eco Oro was deprived of its acquired
right to attempt to meet the applicable environmental licensing requirements during the term

of Concession 3452.5%

Eco Oro was induced by these measures to make its investment and form legitimate
expectations and, prior to Colombia’s measures, Eco Oro had legitimate expectations it
would (i) have exclusive rights to carry out mining activities within Concession 3452; (ii) be
permitted to use the entirety of the Concession area for the duration of any term extensions
subject to complying with its obligations and obtaining the necessary environmental licenses
or authorisations; and (iii) Concession 3452 was protected from legislative or regulatory
developments as well as other governmental acts having the effect of reducing the scope of

Eco Oro’s rights.

These legitimate expectations were frustrated by: (i) Judgment C-35; (ii) Resolution 829;
(iii) ANM’s statements in late 2016 that mining would also be prohibited in the Restoration
Zone of the Santurban Paramo as delimited by Resolution 2090; and (iv) the suggestions
from the CDMB and MinAmbiente that they would be unable to issue an environmental
license, even for areas that had not been delimited by Resolution 2090 as paramo. Indeed,
the Government itself recognised the illegitimacy of its interference with the expectations of
investors such as Eco Oro. The ANM wrote to the Constitutional Court noting that Judgment
C-35 would result in an absolute interference with the contractual rights of concessionaires
equating to indirect expropriation. By frustrating Eco Oro’s legitimate expectations,

Colombia failed to act in good faith and thus the 811(2)(b) Exceptions cannot apply.

Colombia is wrong to say that Eco Oro should have known since at least 2007 that it would
never be permitted to mine in the entirety of the Concession area. When Eco Oro first
invested in Colombia with Permit 3452 there was no ban on mining in the paramos. Permit
3452 expressly stated it did not contain areas within which mining was prohibited. Whilst
the General Environmental Law had been passed in 1993, it did not restrict mining in the
paramos, merely stating that paramos, sub-paramos, springs and aquifer replenishing zones

are subject to “special protection.” There was no guidance as to what that special protection
consisted of, nor did it establish any restrictions on carrying out any activities in those areas
(and indeed no other regulation contained any such restriction at that time). Whilst it
required the granting of environmental licenses for the extraction of natural resources and
required environmental authorities to take account of the precautionary principle when
granting such licences, it is not correct, either as a matter of law or fact, that environmental
authorities denied licences to any project where they could not establish with absolute
certainty such project would not have an adverse effect on the paramo. Environmental
licences were granted to mining projects in areas later delimited as paramos (including areas
within the 2007 Atlas) throughout the late 1990s and the 2000s. Further, the Rio Declaration
specifies that the precautionary principle only applies “where there are threats of serious or
irreversible damage.” The General Environmental Law implemented the precautionary
principle, stating that “[...] the environmental authorities and the individuals will apply the
precautionary principle according to which, where there is a threat of irreversible and grave
harm, the lack of absolute certainty should not be used as a reason to postpone the adoption

of efficient measures to prevent the degradation of the environment.”**!

. Advisory Opinion 2233 confirmed that the mere existence of a potential risk is insufficient

to permit invocation of the precautionary principle, there must be scientific evidence that the
activity presents a risk and that “in general the duties of prevention that the Constitution
assigns to the authorities in this field, do not mean that a product or process can only be
used when it has been demonstrated that it has no risk, as it is impossible to demonstrate the
absence of risk [...]. If there is no basic evidence of a potential risk, the precautionary
principle cannot be arbitrarily invoked to inhibit the undertaking of specific commercial or
investigative practices. Conversely, in cases where a potential risk has been identified, the
precautionary principle obliges the authorities to assess whether or not the risk is tolerable

and to determine the course of action on the basis of that assessment.”

The General Environmental Law did not impose a mining ban in the paramos and in any
event there had been no delimitation of the paramos at that stage. Therefore, when
Concession 3452 was granted there were no laws prohibiting or restricting mining in paramo
areas. All that was in force was Decree 1220 of 21 April 2005,°*° article 10 of which
provided “[...] when [mining projects] are intended to be developed in paramo ecosystems
[...], the environmental authorities shall take into consideration the decisions taken on the
matter regarding their conservation and sustainable use through the different administrative
instruments of environmental management.” Further, several environmental licences were
issued in areas subsequently delimited as paramo around the same time. The fact that the
2007 Atlas had been published did not give the paramos any “heightened importance” such
that “obtaining an environmental licence [...] would have been an uphill task.”***
Colombia’s assertion is also inconsistent with the fact that Colombia created the Vetas-
California Mining District less than two years before Concession 3452 was executed, the
purpose of which was to develop the mining industry there by “increasing the participation
of mining investors [...] both junior and development companies, as well as conglomerates
and traditional mining companies to attract technical resources and national and foreign

capital to the sector.”°*>

Resolution 2090 did not “confirm” the 2007 Atlas delimitation. Firstly, Ms. Baptiste
confirmed that to delineate the paramos required the IAvH to prepare a new set of criteria
and an adequate methodology*® and, further, the Santurban Paramo delineated at a 1:25,000
scale by the IAVH is approximately 56% larger than the total area identified in the 2007 Atlas
and the total paramo area in Colombia under the 2012 Atlas was 47% larger than that in the
2007 Atlas.*8’ Indeed, the [AVH commented that regional environmental authorities used

their own information with regard to the location of the paramos rather than using the 2007

Decree No. 1220 of 2005 (21 April 2005) (Exhibit C-97).

Atlas*** and therefore Colombia is incorrect to say the 2007 Atlas was a “widely accepted”

source of information on paramos.

It is also incorrect that Eco Oro should have understood it would not be permitted to mine in
the Concession area as a result of the denial of its application for an open pit environmental
licence in 2011. The denial was on the basis of certain technical concerns and not on the
basis of Law 1382. Whilst MinAmbiente Order 1241 of 20 April 2010°* (ordering the return
of Eco Oro’s application) required the new EIA to take the Santurban Paramo into
consideration as an area excluded from mining activities (pursuant to Law 1382 which was
found to be unconstitutional), this Order was revoked pursuant to Eco Oro’s successful

appeal with the effect that no mining ban was enforced pursuant to Law 1382.

By Resolution 1015 of 31 May 2011, MinAmbiente denied Eco Oro’s application for an

open-pit licence application>”

(thereby denying Eco Oro’s request to withdraw its open-pit
licence application having decided instead to revert to an underground project) on the basis
of the environmental impact of an open-pit mine pursuant to a 127-page analysis.*°! Such a
detailed analysis would not have been required had there been a mining ban pursuant to Law

1382.

The purpose of appealing Resolution 1015 was only to seek certain clarifications regarding
the implications of this decision for Eco Oro’s future activities. The result of the appeal was
Resolution 35 from ANLA (which had newly been created and the Director General of which
was Ms. Sarmiento). This clarified that the decision was “purely technical, and never
took into consideration any legal grounds.”*°? Therefore, it was not based on Law 1382.
It further confirmed there had been no reliance on the 2007 Atlas which was too imprecise

to be used as a reference,*”* the paramo delineation and regulation of land use within the

paramo had yet to be carried out,>**

and Resolution 1015 had not declared a mining exclusion
ban over the paramo ecosystem.*** It ordered that the text of Resolution 1015 be amended
to include the following: “Likewise, it is important to note that this Ministry is competent to
determine whether or not the project in question is environmentally viable, on the basis of
the applicable technical and legal considerations [...] and not to determine, in light of the
evidence of a paramo ecosystem, its limits and land use [...] which is under the direct
purview of the regional environmental authority with jurisdiction over the said

ecosystem.”>°°

Eco Oro could not have been expected to understand from this that an application for an
underground mine would be rejected: there was no general mining ban based on Laws 1382
and 1450; Resolution 1015 was specific to the open pit mine; and the environmental impact
of the underground mine would be significantly reduced. Indeed, Eco Oro’s request for
Terms of Reference for the underground mine was granted with no reference to any mining
ban but simply a reference to the fact that the EIA should be prepared following the terms
of reference and provisions of Decree 2820 of 5 August 2010 (which regulated the granting
of environmental licences for mining projects in paramo areas) and that Eco Oro should take
into account the fact the Santurban Paramo was in the process of being delimited. This latter
statement merely required Eco Oro to consider the nature of the ecosystems delimited within

Concession 3452 in setting out its environmental mitigation measures in its EIA.

The ANM further did not apply a mining ban based on Law 1450. Eco Oro successfully
appealed Resolution VSC 2 dated 8 August 2012,°°” which had only granted Eco Oro’s
request for a two-year extension of the exploration phase in respect of the non-overlapping
areas of the Concession, pursuant to Law 1450. Thus, Resolution VSC 2 had provided
fora permanent deprivation of Eco Oro’s rights in relation to the overlapping area.

Resolution VSC 4 revoked Resolution VSC 2, acknowledging that the requirements for the

application of a mining exclusion zone pursuant to Law 1450 had not been fulfilled,*”*

thereby extending the exploration phase for a two-year period over the entire Concession

area. Resolution VSC 2 further temporarily suspended activities in the overlapping area
99599

 

“until the Ministry of Environment [...] issues the final delimitation at a 1:25,000 scale.

  

The effect of this is that it cannot be said that Eco Oro should have realised that the 1:25,000
scale delimitation would extend to no less an area than the 2007 Atlas given that the
2007 Atlas was to apply as a “minimum reference” per Law 1450. If that were correct,
Resolution VSC 4 would not have extended the exploration phase for a two-year period
over the entire Concession area, knowing that the overlapping area would have come within
a subsequent delimitation on a 1:25,000 scale. Instead, Resolution VSC 4 acknowledged
that, until the final delimitation was carried out, the legal status of the overlapping area was

“uncertain” and it was “impossible to confirm” whether there was any overlapping area.°°°

Resolution VSC 4 shows that Law 1450 could not create a mining ban until the Santurban
Paramo had been delimited in accordance with the requirements contained therein and that
the temporary suspension ordered was exactly that, temporary, lasting only until the

delimitation of the paramo was published.

It is also noteworthy that Colombia supported the Project and induced Eco Oro to continue
to invest in it by nominating it both as a PIN and a PINE in recognition of its “high impact

on the economic and social growth of Colombia [...]’,°"!

which designation gave the Project
special government support to ensure such projects happen (as royalties were needed for
development).* It is unrealistic to suggest that Colombia would have done this had it
known that this Angostura Project had no prospect of being developed due to a ban on mining

in the paramos. There were several other examples of Governmental support in 2015 and

(vy) Colombia’s Measures were arbitrary, capricious and disproportionate

The above also demonstrates that Colombia’s measures were arbitrary, capricious and
disproportionate. The FTA itself requires, as part of the objects of the Treaty, to ensure a
predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment. Colombia should
have conducted itself “in a coherent manner, without ambiguity, transparently and
maintaining an environment that is sufficiently stable to permit a reasonably diligent
investor to adopt a commercial strategy that it can implement over time.”°4 Colombia’s
measures failed to do this, resulting in a non-transparent and unpredictable regulatory
environment. Pursuant to the definition endorsed by the tribunal in EDF v. Romania,
arbitrariness occurs where “a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion,
prejudice or personal preference”, “a measure taken for reasons that are different from those
put forward by the decision maker” or “a measure [is] taken in wilful disregard of due
process and proper procedure.” Further to be reasonable it must be proportionate to the
public interest to be protected, i.e., to the policy objective sought, which policy must be
rational.%° As stated by the Tecmed tribunal, in order to determine if measures were
expropriatory, they considered “whether such actions or measures are proportional to the
public interest presumably protected thereby and to the protection legally granted to
investments, taking into account that the significance of such impact has a key role upon
deciding the proportionality. [...] There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality

between the charge or weight imposed to the foreign investor and the aim sought to be

realised by any expropriatory measure. To value such charge or weight, it is very important
to measure the size of the ownership deprivation caused by the actions of the state and

607

whether such deprivation was compensated or not. The European Court of Human

Rights followed the same approach noting that “there must also be a reasonable relationship
of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised [...}.”°°*
Other tribunals to take the same approach include those in LG&E v. Argentina which noted
that a State measure would be disproportionately severe if it resulted in a “permanent, severe
deprivation of [the investor’s] rights with regard to its investment, or almost complete
deprivation of the value of {the investor’s] investment.”© Eco Oro submits that the effect
of Colombia’s measures was exactly that: a severe and substantial deprivation of the value

of its investment.

In addition to the inconsistent and chaotic approach of the various State bodies, the
delimitation undertaken in Resolution 2090 was also undertaken in an arbitrary, shambolic
and disproportionate manner. No documents have been disclosed showing how social-
economic criteria were factored into the Resolution 2090 delimitation notwithstanding the
legal requirement that the delimitation be undertaken on the basis of technical,

environmental, social and economic studies.

Ms. Baptiste describes the methodology for preparing proposals for the delimitation of
paramo ecosystems in her witness statement by reference to a document titled the “Forest

Paramo Transition” publication,°!°

which she describes as “a reference for understanding
the preparation of the biotic technical inputs used as a basis for the issuance by the [[AvH]
of recommendations aimed at the delineation of paramos in the country.” The methodology
contained therein required the identification of the Transition Zone, based on statistical
models populated with data obtained through, inter alia, data gathered in field studies and

the accuracy of the modelling results would also be verified using field data studies. There

was a detailed protocol for these field studies, consisting of 60 pages. Colombia further
confirmed that the probabilistic models were supplemented and corrected to the extent
necessary with targeted field studies. However, Colombia has confirmed that no field studies
were undertaken for the purpose of the delimitation of the Santurban Paramo. Colombia’s
assertion that the actual methodology was set out in the Contributions Document and not the
Forest-Paramo Transition Document cannot be correct as the Contributions Document

merely sets out the Paramo delimitation proposal and not its actual methodology.

Colombia says that targeted field studies would have been redundant because it used existing
field records and secondary information to build the distribution models but again this cannot
be right. The IAVH itself states, in a report dated 2013, that “[t]he extension of this [ecotone
or transition] strip requires further verification with fieldwork, which will be the subject of

subsequent phases, with greater levels of cartographic detail (1:25,000).”°"!

Finally, Colombia justifies itself by saying it did not have the financial and logistical
resources to carry out fieldwork but this cannot be correct as, at the same time it was
delimiting other paramos, such as the Pisba paramo, using extensive field studies. Even
were it to have been correct, given that the Angostura Deposit consisted of just 0.1% of the
delimited paramo,*'? field studies could have been undertaken in that area. Alternatively,
the ECODES Report could have been adopted which was prepared by over 50 professionals
along transects from over 165 sites within and outside the Angostura Deposit and which
concluded there was no paramo within the area comprising the Angostura deposit. Instead
of using this however the IAvH relied upon historic databases, with no indication as to how
the data was collected, together with a field study conducted as a part of a different study by
a single undergraduate biology student who only visited seven plotted sites, and which was
not carried out along transects and did not meet the requirements set out in the Forest Paramo
Transition document. Additionally, the closest sample was taken 10 kilometers away from

the Angostura Deposit. The IAvH also failed to use any field data to verify its results,

IAvH, “Contributions to the strategic conservation of the Colombian paramos: Updating the mapping of the
paramo complexes to a scale of 1:100,000” (6 February 2014) (Exhibit C-200).

The Tribunal notes that, whilst in para. 26 of his first witness statement, Mr. Moseley-Williams refers to the
percentage overlap as being 0.09%, in certain instances in Eco Oro’s memorials (e.g., paras. 164, 199, 240 of
Claimant’s Reply) the reference is rounded up to 0.1%. The Tribunal does not find anything turns on this.

notwithstanding that Annex 8 to the Contributions Document noted that evaluation and
validation would be undertaken with field data as well as satellite images from the technical

delimitation proposal.°'?

In addition, what was delimited was not the paramo ecosystem but the Transition Zone
between the High Andean forest and the paramo ecosystem. Had the IAvH used the upper
limit of the Transition Zone almost the entirety of the Angostura Deposit would have
remained outside the delimited zone.°'* Further, the IAvH didn’t even follow the Transition
Zone boundary but instead simply followed the altitudinal contour lines, in particular the
3100 mas! line, most often near the lower limit of the Transition Zone but sometimes
significantly deviating to include areas neither in the paramo nor the Transition Zone and, in
the case of Concession 3452, it just follows an altitudinal line such that only 50% of the area
of the 2090 Delimitation corresponds to the paramo ecosystem. MinAmbiente did not
scrutinise the IAvH’s proposed delineation and it has been at least twice criticised by
the Constitutional Court for lacking in adequate scientific criteria in certain respects®!> and
for MinAmbiente’s failure to properly conduct the required consultation process.
It also took note of MinAmbiente’s concession that serious errors were made in the

delimitation process.°!°

Implementation of the Resolution 2090 delimitation was also disproportionate to the
legitimate interest in protecting it: the aim was to delineate on a scale of 1:25,000 based on
technical, economic, social and environmental studies but instead, it employed excessive
means in delimiting not the paramo but a different ecosystem which included not just the
Transition Zone but in certain places, even areas below it. This particularly affected
Eco Oro. The Angostura deposit overlapped with only 0.09% of the total delimited area,
only approximately 6% of the Angostura deposit lies within the actual paramo ecosystem,

with 65.11% lying within the Transition Zone, the remaining 29% is neither in the paramo

Colombia confirmed that Annex 8 only used satellite images and not field studies, the reference to “field
studies” in the title being an “oversight” by IAvH — see Letter from Latham & Watkins to Freshfields
Bruckhaus Deringer (28 May 2019) (Exhibit C-431).

By including the transition zone, the overlap with the Angostura Deposit increased from 6% to 60%.

617

nor the Transition Zone. Less stringent measures could have been taken such as delimiting
the paramo based on the location of the ecosystem as instructed by Law 1450, employing
field studies, or using the ECODES Report and allowing Eco Oro to present its project to the
environmental licensing authorities. The precautionary principle does not assist Colombia
as it is not applicable as there is no existing threat of serious or irreversible harm —the mere
existence of a potential risk is insufficient to permit Colombia to invoke the precautionary

principle.

Finally, as Eco Oro had decided to mine using underground operations, the impact on the
environment would have been minimised and the Government could have taken more

circumscribed measures to protect the paramo.

In conclusion, the [AvH did not follow its own methodology (which placed heavy emphasis
on conducting field studies to verify the results of probabilistic modelling) as it failed to
conduct the required field studies and sampling.°!” Whilst Ms. Baptiste said this would have
been “inappropriate” and not “practicable”, it was what the IAvH’s own methodology
required and this methodology was followed when delineating another paramo system in

2013.

However, not only was the delimitation carried out in breach of the legal requirements, it
was also carried out in bad faith and in a non-transparent manner, as evidenced by the
significant delays in the Minister of Environment, Ms. Sarmiento, publishing the
delimitation which the Constitutional Court found (Judgement T-361) to have been in
“bad faith.” The Constitutional Court further criticised MinAmbiente’s actions finding that
they “violated the right to environmental participation of the petitioners and the entire
community of the area of influence of the Santurban Paramo in issuing Resolution
No. 2090”, denied access to information, failed to involve all parties affected by the
delimitation to participate in the consultation exercise but instead specified the number of
people to be invited even identifying the representative group from which they should be

invited and failed to ensure “prior, efficacious and effective forums” for community

participation.°'® Indeed the Minister even gave an interview in which she promised that the
paramo boundary would shortly be published, yet notwithstanding that she withheld
the boundaries, she announced publicly that the Santurban Paramo overlapped with

Concession 3452.

Colombia has not produced the ANM’s proposed paramo delimitation and memorandum
summarising the reasons for its proposal, notwithstanding that Article 34 of the 2001 Mining
Code requires the ANM’s collaboration. Eco Oro requests that the Tribunal draws an

adverse inference from Colombia’s failure to produce this.

Finally, the community consultations did not happen as referred to by the Constitutional

Court when striking down Resolution 2090.

(vi) There was no transparent or predictable regulatory environment

Eco Oro was also subjected to a regulatory turmoil as a result of:

a. MinAmbiente announcing in late 2013 that the delimitation had been finalised but
then refusing to provide the co-ordinates (provoking a letter from the Attorney
General to MinMinas, MinAmbiente and the ANM deploring the legal uncertainty

this caused to the mining industry");

b. the Resolution 2090 delimitation;
c. Resolution VSC 3;

d. whilst Article 5 of Resolution 2090 provided that regional environmental
authorities such as the CDMB should issue more detailed environmental guidelines
and PMAs for the paramos in their localities, this has yet to be done by the CDMB

for the Santurban Paramo;

requisite environmental guidelines);

f. Judgment C-35 only striking down the grandfathering exceptions in Law 1753 but
not those in Resolution 2090 leading the Minister of Mines and Energy to say “we
have been left in a very serious situation: there are so many norms and we do not

know what the rule is.”;°°

j. Judgment T-361;

k. the initial extension to file a PTO until the new delimitation was complete followed
by the failure to agree a concomitant extension when the period for completing the

1. Resolution VSC 906 (rejecting Eco Oro’s request for a further suspension) and
requiring preparation of the PTO which, pursuant to the 2001 Mining Code,
required identification of the “definitive delimitation of the exploitation area” yet
in the absence of final delimitation of the Santurban Paramo this was impossible.
It should be noted that Resolution VSC 906 was predicated on the basis Judgment
C-35 was foreseeable but Eco Oro could not have planned for the risk a legislative
act would be struck down as unconstitutional. It was also arbitrary, unreasonable

and discriminatory because firstly, the ANM had approved a suspension request for

(Exhibit C-243).

242/387

a different mining company that had requested a suspension on the same basis“?!
and, secondly, two weeks earlier the ANM had granted Eco Oro the same
suspension request on the grounds of “unforeseeab[ility]” which had been made on

the same grounds but for a different concession area (Concession 22346);

ANM Resolution VSC 343 rejecting Eco Oro’s appeal was arbitrary and
unreasonable and nonsensical given that Judgement T-361 required the re-

delimitation of the 2090 Delimitation;

. ANM’s letter dated 24 December 2018 refusing to grant an extension for filing the

PTO was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable in refusing to grant a concomitant
extension for filing the PTO as was given for MinAmbiente to complete the

re- delimitation; and

. ANM Resolution VSC 41 ordering Eco Oro to submit its PTO within 30 days which

was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable given the ANM was aware that this was

impossible for Eco Oro to achieve.

577. Inconclusion, Colombia’s measures were not implemented in good faith as demonstrated by

621

the following:

a.

The act of delineating areas of Concession 3452 as being within the paramo without

conducting any supporting field study was arbitrary and non-transparent;

The withholding by MinAmbiente of the coordinates of the Santurban Paramo for

many months was, as described by the Constitutional Court, bad faith;

MinAmbiente’s failure both to consult with all potentially affected parties and to

allow them to participate meaningfully in the delineation process;

The various inconsistent, unresponsive and confusing communications from

the ANM;

581.

e. The ANM’s refusal to suspend Eco Oro’s obligations until the uncertainty ended;

f. The admission by MinAmbiente that the delineation in Resolution 2090 was deeply

flawed and required correction, as endorsed by the Constitutional Court; and

g. The Government’s failure to prevent illegal miners using mining and processing
methods that pose a threat to the environment compared with professional miners
such as Eco Oro demonstrates a failure to implement its policies in a consistent and

coherent manner.

Thus, the day before Resolution 2090 was published, Eco Oro’s Treaty-protected rights
arising out of Concession 3452 and its regulatory framework consisted of: (i) the exclusive
right to explore and exploit mineral resources in the entirety of the concession area; (ii) the
right to a stabilised mining legal framework such that only those new, more favourable
mining laws enacted after the execution of Concession 3452 in February 2007 would apply
to its concession; and (iii) the right to renew the Concession for an additional 30 years upon

fulfilling the requisite conditions.

Having demonstrated that Colombia’s measures do not fall within the 811(2)(b) Exceptions
and are compensable, it is also clear that taking into account the factors in Annex 811(2)(a),
that there has been an indirect expropriation. Concession 3452 is valueless and thus the

economic effect is equivalent to direct expropriation.

As no compensation has been offered, this expropriation is unlawful. Accordingly, Eco Oro

seeks compensation and it elects the valuation date to be the date of the expropriation.

(b) The Respondent’s Position

(i) The FTA Establishes the Primacy of Environmental Protection Over
Trade and Investment
For Eco Oro to succeed it must show (i) that its mining rights were not curtailed by the
mining ban established by Law 1382 because it had grandfathered rights and (ii) that its
rights were not curtailed by the mining ban established by Law 1450 because it did not
become effective until the issuance of Resolution 2090. Eco Oro cannot demonstrate either
of these.

582.

583.

584.

22

Eco Oro did not have grandfathered rights under Law 1382, Resolution 2090 or Law 1450
because grandfathering was only available to concessions which had already reached the
construction or exploitation phase. This can be seen from the wording of the relevant
provisions. Starting with Resolution 2090, it is undisputed Eco Oro did not have an
environmental license, but neither was it in possession of “the equivalent environmental
control and management instrument duly granted before 9 February 2010.”°? The key
word is “equivalent”, namely equivalent to an environmental license. To be the equivalent
of the environmental licence it must have an equivalent effect to that of an environmental
license, namely the right to exploit. Eco Oro’s PMA is not equivalent to an environmental
license. The only PMA that was approved was dated in 1997 which was before Eco Oro had
acquired all the titles which comprised Concession 3452. It did not permit exploitation but
was expressly limited to the exploration phase and on its face stated that the relevant
environmental license would need to be obtained to undertake exploitation activities. It only
covered an area of 250 hectares whereas Concession 3452 comprised more than 5,000
hectares and its scope was very limited in terms of the work it covered, being only in relation
to some roads and tunnels. Whilst Eco Oro provided an updated PMA in 2008 (notably
again only in relation to exploration activities), it was also not approved. It should be noted
that the 1997 PMA provided that any planned modifications had to be reviewed and
approved. Further, at the time both the 1997 and 2008 PMAs were prepared, they were both

in respect of the proposed open cast mine; they did not contemplate the underground mine.

The PMA was therefore not equivalent to an Environmental Licence and consequently Eco
Oro did not benefit from the grandfathering provision. It is also of note that Eco Oro did not
argue that its rights were grandfathered at the relevant time and, when ANM issued
Resolution VSC 2 reducing Eco Oro’s concession area, it expressly noted that the transition
regime did not apply, yet when Eco Oro appealed this decision, Eco Oro did not explicitly

assert that its rights were grandfathered.
Turning to the construction of the FTA, on a good faith reading of Chapters Eight, Seventeen

(particularly Article 1702) and Twenty-Two (particularly Article 2201(3)) the primacy of

environmental protection over trade and investment is clear. This is confirmed by the
Government of Canada which stated that the FTA “allow[s] the countries to take certain
measures to protect human, animal and plant life or health which may be inconsistent with

trade or investment obligations.”°?

In the absence of arbitrariness, unjustifiable
discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, a State cannot
be held liable for adopting measures to protect the environment unfettered from any
obligation to compensate investors. Whilst the preamble to the FTA does refer to the
objective of ensuring a predictable commercial framework for business planning and
investment, it is notable that this is to be done only in a manner that is consistent with
environmental protection and conservation, as stated in Chapter Seventeen and the Canada-

”ye4 which was

Colombia Environment Agreement (the “Environment Agreement
intended to be complementary and closely interrelated with the FTA pursuant to Article
1704(1) and is indeed expressly referred to in the Article 1703 of the FTA. The statement
of the Government of Canada must also be taken into consideration, providing: “[t]he
Environment Agreement, signed in parallel to the [FTA], reinforces the concept that free
trade should not take place at the expense of the environment.”® This deliberate policy

decision must inform the interpretation of Chapter Eight.

(ii) Colombia Did Not Expropriate Eco Oro’s Investment

As well as not having a covered investment (as Eco Oro had no acquired right to exploit),
the measures complained of by Eco Oro did not have an effect equivalent to direct
expropriation as there was no deprivation. Colombia had reserved to itself the right to
designate Mining Exclusion Zones by Articles 34 and 36 of the 2001 Mining Code.
This right is a contractual right, the exercise of which cannot constitute deprivation. Thus,
up to the point at which Eco Oro acquired rights to exploit (which it never acquired)
Colombia had the right to make that designation and remove areas from Concession 3452,

the exercise of which could not constitute a violation of international law. Even if it were

found to be a deprivation, it occurred pursuant to VSC 2 and 4 of August and September

2012 and therefore it occurred prior to the mandatory cut-off date.

Further, the measures did not affect the totality of the concession area, indeed over a third of
the Angostura Deposit remained unaffected such that substantial value in concession 3452
remained unadulterated. Eco Oro’s loss was partial and therefore not expropriatory. Whilst
Mr. Moseley-Williams asserted that the uncertainty over the remaining areas of Concession
3452 “made developing plans impossible”,®* this was unsupported and, in any event, Eco
Oro was not prevented from carrying out mining in those areas of the concession which did
not overlap the paramo —it just had to comply with the applicable requirements. The
possibility of Eco Oro obtaining a license but for Colombia’s measures was remote at best
given the lack of any evidence adduced (other than the bare assertions in Mr. Moseley-
Williams’ statement) as to the technical, economic or environmental feasibility of such a
project. Indeed, it is “overwhelmingly likely’ that any mining project would have been
rejected in light of the precautionary principle which must be complied with by public

agencies when assessing environmental impact and taking licensing decisions.°?”

Turning to the first stated factor in Annex 811(2)(a), there was no economic impact from the
measures complained of by Eco Oro. Firstly, on 26 April 2010 Eco Oro’s share price
collapsed by more than half when its open cast mining licence application was rejected (from
$463 million on Friday 23 April to $220 million on Monday 26 April 2010) and then
dropping very significantly when Law 1382 was applied to Concession 3452 by Resolution
VSC 4, in September 2012, with the entire enterprise value falling to below $20 million.
This was all before the measures complained of. Any economic impact of the alleged
expropriatory measures would be demonstrated by a significant fall in Eco Oro’s share price
but there was no significant deterioration in the share price at the time of or after the measures
complained of — that drop had already occurred, as a result of Laws 1382 and 1450 and
Resolution 937. Additionally, the 2090 Atlas did not significantly increase the area which

had already been delimited as paramo by the 2007 Atlas.

588. Turning to the second factor, it is important to note that this does not direct the analysis

589.

590.

591.

628

towards a frustration or violation of legitimate expectations; the provision is narrower,
referring to the extent to which there is interference with reasonable investment-backed
expectations. A reasonable investment-backed expectation is one held at the time of making
the investment, it causes the investor to make the investment, and there is clearly an
obligation on the investor to undertake due diligence both before making the investment and

before making further investments.

Eco Oro cannot have had any distinct reasonable investment-backed expectations that it

would have been permitted to undertake exploitation activities in the paramo.

Colombia did not give Eco Oro any specific assurance that measures would not be taken to
protect the paramo within Concession 3452 and Eco Oro could not have held any reasonable
investment-backed expectation that it would be permitted to mine in the entirety of
Concession 3452. Such a belief could not have survived even basic due diligence.
No commitments were given to Eco Oro, nor is there any evidence that Eco Oro made its
investment in reliance upon any such commitment. No stabilization agreement was entered
into and, by entering into Concession 3452, Eco Oro voluntarily subjected itself to the regime
provided for under the 2001 Mining Code; it is irrelevant whether any previous regime did
contain such a guarantee. The 2001 Mining Code and applicable legislation at that time did
not contain any guarantees that measures would not be taken to protect the environment from
the effects of mining exploitation. It merely confirmed that the laws applicable to the
concession are the “mining laws in force at the time that the concession contract is

perfected.”°*

The environmental legislation in force in 2007 restricted Eco Oro’s ability to proceed with
the Angostura Project due to the requirement to obtain an environmental licence before
undertaking mining activities. Indeed, had Eco Oro undertaken even basic due diligence

prior to investing in Concession 3452 it would have realised that mining would be prohibited

as a significant portion of the area overlapped with paramo and Colombia had a long-

standing policy to protect the paramo which is demonstrated by:

a. Article 4 of the General Environmental Law which designated paramos as
ecosystems subject to “special protection” as a general environmental principle and
Article 1 refers to the Rio Principles, Principle 15 of which provides for the
application of the precautionary principle which principle is directly enshrined into
Colombian law by Article 1.6 of the General Environmental Law. Eco Oro must
have known at the time it entered into the concession that the prospect of obtaining
an environmental licence for a project located in the paramo ecosystem was very

limited if non-existent.

b. Resolution No. 769 of 2002, pursuant to which CDMB and CORPONOR had
engaged in significant efforts to delineate the Santurban Paramo, assess its

condition and take steps to protect it.

c. The 2007 Atlas which confirmed that the Santurban Paramo overlapped a part of

Concession 3452.

d. Eco Oro should further have been aware of the authorities’ approach to licensing
applications pursuant to the precautionary principle (Colombia’s environmental
authorities have never granted licences for projects adversely impacting paramo
ecosystems) and could not have had any reasonable expectation that the authorities

would derogate from this principle.

592. Eco Oro’s legitimate expectations could not have been frustrated by Judgment C-35 because
Eco Oro had no grandfathered rights. The ANM’s August 2016 decision was fully in line
with the then existing legislation to protect the paramo, including Laws 1382 and 1450.
Eco Oro has not adduced any credible evidence that the statements it asserts were made by
CDMB and MinAmbiente were in fact made and, even if they had been made, they could
not have frustrated Eco Oro’s legitimate expectations as they were not made by the authority

responsible for the licensing of Eco Oro’s project, namely ANLA.

Even had Eco Oro had legitimate expectations that Colombia would take measures to protect
the paramo in a way that would prevent it from mining in the entirety of the concession area,
as the facts upon which Eco Oro says it based its expectations all took place before the entry
into force of the FTA, those facts are not binding on Colombia (Article 801(2)). Eco Oro
knew by August 2011 that Colombia had decided to take measures to ban mining in the
paramo areas delineated in the 2007 Atlas; this is why its application for an environmental
licence for an open pit mine failed. It knew that even though the 2007 Atlas delineation was

not definitive, mining in a significant part of its concession area would not be possible.

It knew open-cast mining would not be permitted (its application for a mining licence for
this had been rejected) and there can be no violation of legitimate expectations where a State

is just exercising an expressly reserved right.

Eco Oro would have been required to satisfy itself that the basis for its expectations were
reasonable and accurate and yet it has adduced no evidence of having undertaken such due
diligence. It was no secret that Colombia was seeking to protect the paramo in accordance
with its international obligations so to do. Eco Oro could not have had any legitimate
expectation that that right would not have been exercised. Eco Oro must have been aware
that Colombia had been taking steps to protect the paramo “in the strongest possible way”?
and indeed by the time Concession 3452 took legal force upon registration, 54% of the
Concession 3452 area had been designated as paramo pursuant to the 2007 Atlas. Eco Oro
has adduced no evidence of any due diligence having been carried out in relation to

this investment.

The Bilcon case is not applicable as, in that case, the concessionaire had already applied for
an environmental licence (which was rejected forming the basis of the alleged deprivation)
and in the relevant Treaty there was no express reservation of a right by the State to revoke

part of the contractual entitlement of the concessionaire.

In summary, Eco Oro could not have formed any legitimate expectations that it would be
permitted to conduct mining exploitation activities throughout Concession 3452

notwithstanding the existence of paramo ecosystems.

The third listed factor is equally of no avail to Eco Oro. The measures were regulatory
measures taken pursuant to Colombia’s long-standing policy to protect the paramo, resulting
from the Ramsar Convention, the Biodiversity Convention and the laws Colombia
implemented to give effect to these obligations. The measures were all bona fide, regulatory

and non-discriminatory.

Only if the Tribunal finds a prima facie case for indirect expropriation can it then turn to
apply Annex 811(2)(b). It is therefore not necessary to consider the meaning and application
of Annex 811(2)(b) as Eco Oro doesn’t succeed in showing that having investigated the facts
surrounding Eco Oro’s claim, considering the relevant factors, that it suffered deprivation of

its rights.

However, even if Annex 811(2)(b) were relevant, Colombia’s measures fall squarely within
its ambit. Eco Oro has not established any “rare” circumstances supporting a finding that
Colombia’s non-discriminatory regulatory measures for the protection of the environment

could amount to an indirect expropriation under the FTA.

Whilst Annex 811(2)(b) is the embodiment of the police powers doctrine, it clearly applies
to the measures complained of as they were taken to protect the environment and were
bona fide and not discriminatory (as accepted by Eco Oro); prima facie it must be common
ground that the measures cannot constitute indirect expropriation. It is clear from (i) the
object and purpose of the FTA; (ii) Canada and Colombia’s mutual undertakings contained
in Article 1702; and (iii) the provisions of the Environment Agreement, that non-
discriminatory measures designed and applied to protect the environment would only
constitute indirect expropriation in “rare circumstances.” This is a high bar given the
example contained in the provision, namely “a measure or series of measures so severe in

the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good

faith” and Eco Oro has failed to meet it, having identified no circumstances that it can

identify as “rare.” The delineation was conducted “responsibly, carefully, eminently

251/387

630

63

632

reasonably, in accordance with the methodology adopted by the IAVH at the time, in

39 such that no rare

accordance with the [...] long standing legal definition of the paramo’
circumstances arise; the measures Colombia took were a legitimate exercise of its sovereign
powers to protect the environment and no compensation is payable even if Eco Oro has
suffered loss. As confirmed by the tribunal in Tecmed, it is “undisputable” that “the State’s
exercise of its sovereign powers within the framework of its police power may cause
economic damage to those subject to its power as administrator without entitling them to

631

any compensation whatsoever. Colombia’s measures were taken pursuant to its

legitimate right to regulate and were not expropriatory measures.

(iii) Legitimate expectations
It is incorrect that Annex 811(2)(b) incorporates the requirement that measures must be
undertaken in good faith bringing in notions such as legitimate expectations, proportionality
and transparency. Just because frustration of legitimate expectations is an exception to the
police powers doctrine, does not mean it must equally be an exception to Annex 811(2)(b).
Whilst Annex 811(2)(b) embodies the police powers doctrine, it is a lex specialis, is
unambiguous and goes beyond the police powers doctrine to give effect to the contracting
parties’ agreed intended subordination of investment protection to environmental concerns.
The concept of interference with expectations comes into Annex 811(2)(a) and it would be
nonsensical if, having addressed this in considering whether there is prima facie an indirect
expropriation that one was then directed to reconsider exactly the same notion in considering
whether the measure is excepted as being a “rare circumstance.” This would be “importing
through the backdoor all of the broad notions of the fair and equitable treatment standard
which form part of [...] the notion of good faith [...].” Annex 811(2)(b) specifically is

addressed at rare circumstances and so the provision must be construed narrowly.

However even if the frustration of legitimate expectations were covered by Annex 811(2)(b),
Colombia’s measures could not have frustrated Eco Oro’s legitimate expectations as it had

none (whether or not investment backed) as detailed above.

(iv) Colombia's Measures were not arbitrary, capricious nor
disproportionate
A requirement of proportionality, lack of capriciousness and non-arbitrariness is also not
enshrined in the text of the provision and the authorities cited by Eco Oro are of no assistance
as Annex 811(2)(b) is /ex specialis. Annex 811 does not refer to “bad faith” as a general
exception, the requirement is for good faith which is not akin to fair and equitable treatment,
and thus does not import requirements such as “fairness”, “transparency”,
“(nonjarbitrariness”, “clarity”, “[nonljambiguity” and “predictab{ility].” The FTA only
provides for the more limited minimum standard of treatment in accordance with customary
international law. Even were the requirement of good faith contained within the FTA, it
carries a high burden which Eco Oro has failed to meet. Each of Colombia’s measures was

taken for the sole purpose of protecting the paramo.

Even again if that were not so, Colombia’s actions were proportionate; there were no less
stringent actions which it could have taken to protect the paramo. The fact that the
overlapping area is small does not make it proportionate to allow mining activities which
could be damaging to the paramo in that area. Eco Oro has not proposed what form such
less stringent measures could have taken. Colombia’s long-standing policy was to protect
the entire paramo. Additionally, “[t]ie delineation process was carried out scientifically by
the IAVH in accordance with international standards, and with the input of many senior
experts in the field [...] carrying out extensive field work to delimit the paramo ecosystem
would have been inappropriate [...] and an impossible task [...] the IAVH developed — and
submitted for peer review — a methodology which relied primarily on satellite imaging and
altitude data, which was then subjected to probabilistic modelling.” Targeted field studies

confirmed and, as necessary, corrected the Transitional Zone delineation. This methodology

635

has not been the subject of serious challenge or debate and thus Colombia’s measures were

proper and proportionate.

(v) The regulatory regime was transparent and predictable

The delimitation process for Resolution 2090 was neither arbitrary nor non-transparent and

was entirely predictable.

IAvH’s proposal for the delimitation exercise resulting in the 2090 Atlas was contained in a
peer-reviewed document titled “Contributions to the delimitation of the paramo” (i.e., the
Contributions Document).°+ This document was “the sole scientific report that was
produced in terms of a technical ecological delimitation of the paramo.”®> The relevant

extracts from the executive summary provide as follows:

“This document was produced [...] with the aim of providing elements of
judgement in biophysical, economic, legal and social aspects that contribute
to the delimitation at 1:25,000 scale of the Complex of paramos of the
Santurbén-Berlin jurisdictions (CJSB) performed by the pertinent
authorities.

[J

For the construction of this document, the starting point was the delivery of
the studies to the MADS by the appropriate CAR in November and December
of 2012, with the assistance of different sources of supporting information,
including research projects carried out by the [IAvH] in said complex, as well
as the Paramos and Life Systems Project, financed by the European Union,
studies conducted by universities, NGOs, private companies, and documents
provided by the community in this process.

Therefore, we present, on one hand, a proposal for the identification of the
lower strip of the Paramo ecosystem, outlined with the assistance of different
techniques, which included fieldwork data collected from different sources,
both recent and historical, models of potential distribution of the ecosystem
and representative species, as well as high resolution spatial satellite imagery
(5m) that attests to the current condition of the territory. The mapping
systems implemented in this process are at 1:25,000 scale.

The basic fact is that the boundaries between ecosystems are not presented
as precise lines in the land, and their identification in a map is an abstraction
exercise on an ecological process (transition) which is actually a gradual
process and appears in the form of a strip, and its extension on the altitudinal
gradient is variable and conditioned by topoclimatic features and the
trajectory of the historical and recent transformations of the landscape.
In line with the delimitation criteria laid down since 2010, this strip is deemed
to show clear elements of the Paramo ecosystem (climate, soils, vegetation,
etcetera) and is therefore undoubtedly part of the paramo in its different
definitions (some of which are supported by law), and necessary for the
preservation of its biodiversity and ecological functions.

Delimitation criteria of the paramos are call attention to the need to
appropriately identify the lower limits of the ecosystem under the following
consideration: 1) the lower paramo or sub-paramo is a part of the ecosystem
and its altitudinal position is not homogenous (which has been observed by
different experts and also recognised in Law 99 of 1993 and in Resolution
MADVT 0769 of 2002 among other regulations) 2) the ecotones, defined as
transitions to adjacent ecosystems 3) connectivity to other ecosystems.”
This document was created for the delimitation of the Santurban Paéramo and does not
contain any reference to field studies needing to be undertaken but instead permits the use
of existing field studies that were carried out under a previous project in 2013. The IAvVH
therefore followed properly the methodology contained in this document. Lessons learned
from the Santurban Paramo delimitation were included in the 2015 Forest Paramo Transition
Conceptual Framework along with all the other work the IAvH had been doing and this
formed the basis for the delineation of all subsequent paramos. However, the pilot, the

Santurban Paramo delimitation, was conducted pursuant to the 2014 document.

The Transition Zone was included in the original definition of the paramo in 2002 in
Resolution 769 (the subparamo or lower level of the paramo) being the low high-Andean
forests which was deemed to be of fundamental importance to the integrity of paramo

ecosystems as explained in the above extract from the I[AvH proposal.

Whilst the Santurban Paramo delimitation contained in Resolution 2090 was a pilot,*° the
only scientific criticism of it was that raised by Eco Oro’s expert, Mr. Aldana. The IAvVH

could not have undertaken its study in the same manner as was undertaken by ECODES as

255/387

637

the area to be delimited by the IAvH was too large and it did not have the resources to
undertake field studies in the entire area. In any event, the exercise was undertaken by the
use of “satellite imagery” and the use of “probabilistic distribution models using secondary
data on vegetation, climate data and topographic data to capture [...] the integrity of the
ecosystem, and determine] the extension of the paramo, including paramo areas altered by

human activity and atypical paramo patches”®*"

which identifies not only where the paramo
is but also where it had been disrupted which, the IAVH had determined, should still be

included as paramo.

. The ECODES Report was not able to assist I[AvH as it was performed according to a different

methodology, and it was of little utility as it related to the Angostura Polygon which had
been affected by ongoing activities for many years. It would also have been inappropriate
to use it as it would have been giving Eco Oro special treatment which IAvH clearly could

not do.

Whilst the IAVH study for the Santurban Paramo delimitation did not include field studies
whereas the subsequent delimitation studies in the Pisba paramo did, this is because there
was additional funding from the Fondo Adaptacion which provided funds for paramos that

had been affected by La Nifia phenomenon. This did not apply to the Santurban Paramo.

MinAmbiente did not withhold the Santurban Paéramo’s coordinates, they were published
when MinAmbiente issued its decision to adopt them. The Constitutional Court neither
found bad faith on the part of MinAmbiente nor that it had withheld the coordinates. Whilst

it did find that it should have disclosed its preparatory work, this is a different matter.

The ANM’s Technical Report, VSC 3, was an internal document, not a communication to

Eco Oro.

The ANM’s rejection of Eco Oro’s request to suspend its concession obligations was neither
arbitrary nor unfair but carefully reasoned, concluding that there was no force majeure such

that the requirements for a suspension were not satisfied.

Finally, Eco Oro has presented no evidence of any failure by the Colombian authorities to

prevent the alleged influx of illegal miners.

(2) Canada’s non-disputing party submission

In its non-disputing party submission, Canada confirms that Article 811 reflects and
incorporates the customary international law with respect to expropriation.** In applying
this Article, the first step is to identify whether there is a valid (i.e., vested) property right
capable of being expropriated: this is a threshold question. A conditional right is insufficient
for the purposes of the FTA. The relevant law is the domestic law of Colombia, being the
host State, and deference should be accorded to any interpretation by domestic courts on this
issue. There must have been a taking of fundamental ownership rights, either directly or
indirectly that causes a substantial deprivation of economic value of the investment; mere
interference with the use or enjoyment of the benefits associated with the investment being
insufficient. However a host State will not be required “to compensate an investment for any

loss ined by the imposition of a non-discriminatory, r ‘y measure designed and

 

applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives” i.e., measures taken pursuant to its
police powers.” This police power is reflected in the FTA in Annex 811 which “provides

guidance on how to distinguish measures that constitute indirect expropriation from

otherwise legitimate governmental action not requiring compensation.”

Having determined the scope of the interest alleged to have been expropriated, determining

whether indirect expropriation has occurred requires a “case-by-case fact based inquiry that

considers and balances a number of factors.” The factors to be considered include those

listed in Annex 811(2)(a). As none of these factors is determinative, nor can be considered

643

in isolation, the impact of the measure on the investment is only one of the relevant factors
to consider and ultimately if a measure falls within the provisions of Annex 811(2))(b) it will
not constitute indirect expropriation “reflect[ing] the deference given to States in their
determination of the level of protection they seek to achieve and the regulatory choices to
achieve these objectives. If the impact of a measure is so severe in the light of its purpose
that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith, this
may however indicate that an indirect expropriation is at issue not the exercise of police
powers. The use of the phrase ‘except in rare circumstances’ and the reference to measures
that ‘cannot reasonably be viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith’ are
consistent with the high degree of deference that States’ regulatory choices should be
accorded. Therefore bona fide non discriminatory regulatory measures to protect the
environment even if they are based on precaution (i.e. in dubio pro ambiente) will ordinarily
nor require compensation even if they affect the value and/or viability of an investor of

another party.”°?

(3) Colombia’s comments on Canada’s non-disputing party submission

As an over-riding point in response, Colombia notes that the Tribunal should place
significant weight on Canada’s submission given (i) Canada has no interest in the outcome
of the dispute; (ii) having been involved in negotiating the FTA, Canada has a “unique
perspective on how the treaty should be interpreted”;“ and (iii) the systemic interest of

States in ensuring consistency of interpretation.

Colombia then notes, with approval, Canada’s submission that Annex 811 reproduces a
State’s police powers and that this (i) accords with Colombia’s submission that it should be
afforded a “wide margin of appreciation to the policy decisions” of its regulatory authorities

and (ii) that it is irreconcilable with Eco Oro’s submission that compensation is payable

where the measure adopted is “disproportionate”, “contrary to legitimate expectations” or

“unreasonable.” Colombia further notes Canada’s submission that only a fully vested right
can be the subject of expropriation and Colombia reiterates that Eco Oro had no such right.
The determination of the “existence, nature and scope of the ‘property right” must include
any applicable limitation and Eco Oro’s rights were always limited by Colombia’s right to
designate mining exclusion zones without payment of compensation pursuant to Articles 34

and 26 of the 2001 Mining Code.**

(4) Eco Oro’s comments on Canada’s non-disputing party submission

Eco Oro first observes that Canada supports its submission that Annex 811(2)(b) is a
codification of the police powers doctrine applicable under customary international law and
is not /ex specialis going far beyond the police powers doctrine. This further means that,
insofar as Annex 811(2)(b) reflects the police powers doctrine under customary international
law, the recognised exceptions will apply under Annex 811(2)(b).%> In particular, a central
tenet of the police powers doctrine is that the measure in question must be bona fide which,

Eco Oro submits, is acknowledged by Canada.°

Eco Oro further notes Canada’s acceptance that Annex 811(2)(b) “does not constitute an
exception that applies after an expropriation has been found but is a recognition that the
exercise of police powers does not engage State responsibility.”°"’ This acknowledges that
“the determination as to whether the police powers doctrine applies must form part of the
overall evaluation of whether there has been indirect expropriation” such that
Annex 811(2)(a) (identifying factors to be taken into account when determining whether
there has been an indirect expropriation) and (b) (identifying circumstances where the

measure will not be treated as indirect expropriation) must be “applied holistically

and coterminously” which undermines Colombia’s argument that the analysis under

Annex 811(2)(a) and (b) are entirely separate.

(5) The Tribunal’s Analysis

As the majority of the Tribunal has determined in paragraph 440 above, Eco Oro had certain
vested rights capable of being expropriated, namely the right to explore, the right to exploit
(albeit a right which could only be exercised upon its PTO being approved and obtaining an
Environmental Licence) and the right to extend its concession at the end of the concession
period. The Tribunal has further determined that no permanent mining exclusion zone had
been established over the Santurban Paramo at the time the FTA entered into force. Given
this finding, the Tribunal does not need to consider here whether Eco Oro’s rights were
grandfathered (whether pursuant to the transition regime adopted under Article 5 of
Resolution 2090 or Article 173(1) of Law 1753): this is a question which goes to the date on
which the expropriation, if there was one, occurred and thus to the quantum of damages and

not to the question of whether an expropriatory act took place.

The Tribunal therefore turns to consider whether the Challenged Measures constitute an
indirect expropriation of Eco Oro’s vested rights or a legitimate exercise by Colombia of its

police powers.

Canada notes in its non-disputing party submission that “the police powers of the State are

expressly reflected in Annex 811°

and both Parties accept this. They disagree as to the
applicability of the generally accepted international law exceptions to the police powers
doctrine. Eco Oro contends that Annex 811(2)(b) reflects a State’s police powers as
understood in international law such that the exceptions under international law apply,
namely whether the measures violated specific commitments given by the State to the
investor, were disproportionate to the public interest® or not implemented in good faith
being arbitrary, unnecessary or otherwise not bona fide requiring consideration of good faith

tenets of fairness, transparency, non-arbitrariness, clarity, non-ambiguity and predictability.

Colombia says that Annex 811(2)(b) is /ex specialis such that the Tribunal does not need to

consider these general international law exceptions.

The tribunal in Philip Morris v. Uruguay, having considered provisions similar to
Annex 811(2)(b), held that such provisions reflect the more general doctrine of police

powers in customary international law.°*!

The Tribunal concurs. Annex 811(2) does not
expressly exclude the application of general international law when seeking to understand
and apply it. Indeed, parties to a Treaty cannot contract out of the system of
international law.°°? When States contract with each other it is inherent that they do so
within the system of international law. Therefore, in interpreting and applying the provisions
of Annex 811(2), awards on the police powers doctrine under customary international law

may provide some guidance (by analogy).

Whilst these awards indicate that various tribunals have taken different approaches on the
order in which to analyse the issues —do you first determine whether the criteria for an
indirect expropriation are met, and then determine whether the exception applies, or vice
versa?— there is no clear consensus in the practise. One approach is to consider whether the
relevant measure falls within the exercise of a State’s police powers before moving to a
careful assessment of whether there may have been an expropriation, including consideration
of deprivation. Applied to the text of Annex 811(2), this approach means considering sub-
paragraph (b) before (a). The tribunals in Methanex v. USA,®? Saluka v. Czech Republic,°*
Investmart v. Czech Republic, WNC Factoring v. Czech Republic® and A11Y v. Czech
Republic®*’ took this approach. A second approach is to consider the threshold issue of

whether there has been a substantial deprivation, before turning to the question of whether

the measures at issue were an exercise by Colombia of its police power. This approach was

Sand Chemtura v. Canada. In both these approaches,

followed in Tecmed v. Mexico®*
tribunals have apparently proceeded on the basis that a decision on police powers is also a
decision on whether there has been an indirect expropriation. In other words, the inquiry
into indirect expropriation and police powers is not distinguishable. In reaching this

conclusion, the following passage in Sa/uka is relied upon:

“It is now established in international law that States are not liable to pay
compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their
regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner bona fide
regulations that are aimed at the general welfare.”°°
A third approach is to evaluate all the relevant facts and then make a decision on whether
the relevant measures were expropriatory or an exercise of the State’s police powers. Rather
than following a two-stage analysis as the first and second approaches summarised above
do, this approach takes all factors into account before reaching a conclusion. This approach

can be seen in Marfin Investment Group and Others v. Cyprus.®°!

Whichever approach is adopted, the exception in Annex 811(2)(b) is best seen as a reflection
or explanation of the factors that are relevant to the expropriation inquiry in Annex 811(2)(a).
An assessment of whether there has been interference “with distinct, reasonable investment-
backed measures” and “the character of the measure or series of measures”
(in Annex 811(2)(a)) can only take place with reference to whether those measures “are
designed and applied to protect legitimate welfare objectives.” This is most obvious in
connection to the ‘character’ criterion but is also true of the ‘expectations’ criterion, as
investors must be taken to understand that States retain the power to regulate in the public
interest. The Tribunal further finds that the question of whether the measure has been
adopted in good faith or bona fides is the same for both the inquiry into expropriation and

that into police powers (or Annex 811(2)(b)) and necessitates consideration of the purpose

of the measures and the degree to which the State’s public policy concern is genuine as
opposed to the process by which the measures were created. Having considered these
alternative approaches, the Tribunal first considers whether the effect of the Challenged
Measures was equivalent to direct expropriation. If so, it then considers whether the
Challenged Measures were a legitimate exercise of Colombia’s police powers or constituted

an indirect expropriation.

It is clear that the measures had a level of adverse economic impact on Eco Oro’s covered
investment however was there a substantial deprivation of Eco Oro’s rights? Eco Oro says
that it was deprived of its right to exploit. This included the right to submit its proposed
environmental measures, as detailed in the submitted PTO, for approval by the
environmental authorities and to apply for an Environmental Licence. The Tribunal notes
Eco Oro’s application for an environmental license for an open-cast mining project was
rejected on environmental grounds. Further, no application was made by Eco Oro for its
proposed underground mining project. Finally, the Tribunal has not been provided with any
evidence as to how this underground project would be acceptable from an environmental
perspective. The difficulty as the Tribunal sees it is that once it was clear that a paramo
ecosystem overlapped with a significant part of the Concession area, it would inevitably have
been challenging for Eco Oro to satisfy the environmental authorities that it could undertake
exploitation activities without damaging the paramo, particularly in circumstances where the
precautionary principle had been enshrined into Colombian law. However, whilst no doubt
a difficult proposition to sustain, Eco Oro says that such an application was not doomed to
inevitable failure. In support of its contention that it could have satisfied the environmental
authorities as to the way in which its underground mining project would have been
environmentally satisfactory, Eco Oro says that 67 environmental licenses have been granted
in areas overlapping paramo ecosystems since the General Environmental Law enshrined
the precautionary principle, covering an area of 14,000 hectares, 29% of which titles had

more than 90% of their surface area within the surface area of a paramo and a further

662

43 environmental licences were being processed (referring to section 6.4.3 of a study

prepared by the IAvH using data as at 2011 for the 1:100,000 delimitation®”).

Ms. Baptiste advised she did not have full knowledge of this. However, in paragraph 77(a)
of its Post-Hearing Brief, Colombia says that: “[...] in accordance with the information
collected by the IAVH in 2011, there were 65 mining titles overlapping with the IAVH Atlas
reference area of the Santurban Paramo. However of those 65 mining titles, only 15 had
obtained environmental authorisations to conduct mining exploitation activities. Further by
December 2014, when Resolution 2090 was issued, the number of mining titles in the
Santurbén Paramo had decreased to 54. Of these 54 mining titles, only 10 had
environmental authorisations to conduct exploitation activities. None of the mining titles or
environmental authorisations in force in December 2014 were issued after 9 February 2010,
when the mining ban in paramo areas under Law 1382 entered into force. Furthermore,
none of these authorisations were for large-scale industrialized mining projects.
The footprint of these projects on the Santurban Paramo was minimal. In fact, less than 1%
of the Santurban Paramo (a mere 174.5 hectares) was covered with mining titles with

environmental authorisations issued prior to 9 February 2010.”

Whilst Colombia says that only 10 of the 54 mining titles in existence at the time Resolution
2090 came into force had obtained exploitation authorisations and these did not relate to
“large-scale industrialised mining projects”, Colombia has not explained the current status
of the remaining 44 mining titles. It is unclear whether PTOs have been approved for
exploitation activities and environmental licences issued in respect of any of the other 44
mining titles or indeed whether applications are currently under consideration. Given this,
whilst it is unarguable that Eco Oro would have faced significant difficulties in obtaining an
approved PTO and Environmental Licence for an underground mining project, the Tribunal
cannot say that Eco Oro had no prospect of success. It cannot be said with certainty that an
application for a PTO for an underground mine and an environmental licence will inevitably
be rejected. As a result of the Challenged Measures, Eco Oro has lost such opportunity to

apply for an approved PTO and an environmental licence in relation to that part of the

IAvH, “Contributions to the strategic conservation of the Colombian paramos: Updating the mapping of the
paramo complexes to a scale of 1:100,000” (6 February 2014) (Exhibit C-200).

concession which overlaps with the area delimited by Resolution 2090 to enable it to exercise

its vested right to exploit.

Eco Oro next says that those areas of Concession 3452 which do not overlap Resolution
2090 were also rendered valueless by the Challenged Measures. Although no expert
evidence was adduced in support of Mr. Moseley-Williams’ testimony, Colombia did not
challenge his testimony that whilst the Angostura Deposit only overlaps 0.09% of the 2090
Atlas, the effect of the Challenged Measures deprives Eco Oro of more than 50% of its
mining rights such that the economics of the Angostura Project are destroyed. On this basis,
Eco Oro has been deprived of its acquired right to exploit, pursuant to which right it has been
deprived of the opportunity to obtain approval of a PTO and apply for an environmental

licence with respect to the totality of the concession area.

Eco Oro’s expectation in entering into the Concession was to make a profit. The purpose of
the Concession was, as specified in Clause One, exploitation and it is typically only in the
exploitation phase of a project such as this that significant economic benefits may be
obtained, the costs of exploration having been incurred. It is indisputable that a deprivation
of this right will have caused potential economic loss to Eco Oro, but does this comprise
severe deprivation? Eco Oro’s share price had already dropped significantly when its open-
pit mining application was rejected in April 2010 (being before the cut-off date) and at this
point there was certainly a devastating economic impact to Concession 3452. Whilst the
share price did rise in early 2015 before again falling after implementation of the Challenged
Measures, the decline in share value in April 2010 appears more significant than that caused
by the Challenged Measures. However, Eco Oro suffered the complete deprivation of a
potential right to exploit. Without a right to exploit, albeit a right which was dependent upon
an approved PTO and environmental licence, there was no possibility of exploiting the
Angustura Deposit such that the Concession became valueless. Whilst of course the actual
economic value of the right to exploit in that area was uncertain, given the need to obtain a
future approval of the PTO and to obtain an Environmental Licence in circumstances where
the chances of making a successful application appear to be minimal, that exploitation right

was lost in totality as a result of the Challenged Measures. The Tribunal finds that this loss

265/387

636.

637.

663

664

is capable of being considered to be a substantial deprivation, such as to amount to an indirect

expropriation.

The Tribunal therefore turns to consider whether the Challenged Measures were a legitimate
exercise of Colombia’s police powers pursuant to Annex 811(2)(b): were they a non-
discriminatory measure or series of measures designed and applied to protect the
environment. If the answers to these questions are both yes, there is no indirect expropriation

unless they comprise a rare circumstance.

Turning first to their purpose, it cannot be disputed that the Challenged Measures were for
the protection of the environment, and it could not be argued the concern to protect the
paramo was in all respects a legitimate one. Paramos have significant environmental
importance, recognised at the national and international levels. Firstly, they provide
ecosystem services, the most important of which is water supply (supplying 70% of
Colombia’s water) and the regulation of the water cycle. Paramos effectively act like
sponges, taking in water from the atmosphere and enabling it to move down to the water
tables and so the soil plays a critical role in absorbing and carrying the water. The Santurban
Paramo is a particularly humid paramo, providing water to about 2.5 million people in
68 surrounding municipalities. Secondly, paramos capture large amounts of carbon from the

atmosphere.

Paramos are under threat from both human intervention and climate change. Due to the
predominantly cold weather and low availability of oxygen, they have a very slow
metabolism, which produces low growth and decomposition rates which makes their ability

to recover particularly slow®® and there is “consensus that the paramo’s ability to recover

from either open pit or underground mining activities is very low. Underground mining, for

example, can modify water drainage systems and carries the risk of drying out or reducing
water bodies and surface water flows.”°*+ Indeed, in determining the EIA submitted by

Eco Oro for its open pit mining project, Ms. Baptiste notes that “mining activities are

frequently harmful for biodiversity and soil recovery” and, as detailed in [AvH’s report

Constitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (Exhibit C-42), para. 155.
First Baptiste Statement, para. 36.

266/387

rejecting Eco Oro’s EIA, the IAvH noted that restoration measures would not be feasible

or viable.
638. The Constitutional Court notes in paragraphs 155 and 158-160 of Judgment C-35 that:

“restoration or recovery of a paramo ecosystem is virtually impossible [...].
Therefore when the soil and subsoil ecosystem functions suffer negative
impacts, such impacts are generally irreversible.

[J

In a nutshell, given the different factors of vulnerability that may affect the
subsoil, the soil, the flora, the fauna and the air in paramo ecosystems, we can
conclude that they are vulnerable ecosystems. Such vulnerability increases
if we take into account that their recovery capacity is slower than other
ecosystems.

Apart from the vulnerability factors mentioned above, paramo ecosystems
have very low resistance and resilience thresholds, that is to say they are
fragile ecosystems [...].

Currently the most common disturbances in paramo ecosystems are: [...] (iv)
open pit and underground mining [...].

Thus we should conclude that, owing to the vulnerability of the paramo
ecosystems, and the role they play in the regulation of the water cycle and in
carbon capturing, the paramo delimitation process carried out by the
Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development is of essential
importance [...].”°°

639. The Constitutional Court further noted in Judgment T-361 that:

“The right to environmental participation is reinforced in the paramos
governance. This is due to the fact that such biomes are of great importance
to the legal system because: (i) they are an ecosystem featuring great
diversity that needs to be preserved; and (ii) they offer environmental services
that are most significant for society life, such as the regulation of the
hydrologic cycle and the sequestration of atmospheric carbon.

267/387

In turn that biome is exposed to multiple disturbances that can destroy it, such
as crop farming, animal farming, mining or global warming, which processes
would bring societal wellbeing levels down. Therefore, it is necessary to
adopt tools that will preserve such natural environments: delimitation is an
example of such environmental management. However, the protection of
paramo ecosystems stands as a difficult task due to the debate concerning the
concept of paramos and the delimitation of the boundaries separating
paramos from the upper Andean forest. In view of this situation, paramo
management should seek the sustainability of such ecological niches and take
into consideration paramo interactions with other natural environments.
An example of this is the inclusion of the forest paramo buffer zone (FPBZ)
within its boundaries.”°°

640. The Tribunal further does not understand it to be contended that the measures were

641.

667

discriminatory in any way. The measures affected all mining concessionaires whose
concessions overlapped the Santurban Paramo. The Tribunal understands that there were
around 65 mining titles covering approximately 10% of the Santurban Paramo which would
potentially be affected by a mining ban, some locally owned and some owned by foreign
companies. Whilst there was clearly a tension between the aspirations of MinMinas and
MinAmbiente, the Tribunal does not find there was any evidence of an intention expressly
to target Eco Oro, or that Eco Oro was inadvertently targeted. It is clear from the local
demonstrations that many artisanal miners and local populations were equally concerned at
the prospect of losing both their mining rights (to the extent they had such rights) and their
livelihood, which had been dependent upon mining being undertaken in their localities.
Indeed, the Mayors of Soto Norte and other relevant localities sent a letter to MinAmbiente
and CDMB, with 70 pages of signatures attached, complaining of the lack of opportunity for
them to participate in the consultation exercise, noting that (i) 90% of the population in the
affected area relied directly or indirectly on mining activities; (ii) legal uncertainty with
respect to delimitation had led to unemployment and illegal mining; (iii) any delimitation
should not ignore the acquired rights of existing mining title holders; and (iv) that a

transitional regime be established.
MinMinas and MinAmbiente therefore had to balance the competing interests of the

environment and of the economic rights of private persons. In this regard, the Tribunal notes

onl

that whilst the artisanal miners and local populations were relocated or compensated by the

68 no such offer was made to Eco Oro. The Tribunal also notes the Constitutional

State,
Court’s reference to the right of an affected holder of a mining title, such as Eco Oro, to seek
compensation from the State. In response to questions from the Tribunal, Professor Ricaurte
advised that, in her view, a private party, such as Eco Oro, which had suffered harm as a
result of the State taking measures to protect the general interest in preserving the paramo,
was entitled to make an application for compensation, the assessment of which would be
conducted by the court. An action could be brought against the Government before the
administrative courts claiming compensation for violation of such private contractual rights
although, as explained by Professor Ricaurte, no such claims have yet reached the
Colombian High Courts, as the declaration of excluded areas is quite recent and there are
therefore no final judgements at the present time. This possibility of recourse is also
supported by the Consejo de Estado in Advisory Opinion 2233. Whilst Eco Oro was
required to, and did, waive such rights when commencing this arbitration, the Tribunal
accepts there was a constitutional right available to Eco Oro to seek compensation from the

State in the Colombian courts.°”°

Accordingly, whilst the solution to this “balancing
exercise” directly affected Eco Oro, the Tribunal does not find, on the basis of the
evidence before it, that the solution adopted by Colombia in terms of the measures
complained against could be said to have been targeted (negatively) against Eco Oro;

instead, the measures had a positive objective, namely to preserve the paramo.

The majority of the Tribunal therefore finds that the Challenged Measures were non-
discriminatory and designed and applied to protect a legitimate public welfare objective,
namely the protection of the environment. They were adopted in good faith. The Challenged
Measures were therefore a legitimate exercise by Colombia of its police powers unless they
comprise a rare circumstance such that they constitute indirect expropriation pursuant to

Annex 811(2)(a).

In determining whether the Challenged Measures are a rare circumstance, the Tribunal is
informed by the factors detailed in Annex 811(2)(a) as well as by the example contained in
Annex 811(2)(b): are the measures so severe that they cannot reasonably be regarded as
having been adopted in good faith. To be clear, whilst the Tribunal does not accept, if it
were so contended, that it must make a finding of bad faith or disproportionality with respect
to the effect of the measures taken, equally, a measure adopted in good faith is unlikely to
comprise a rare circumstance for the purposes of Annex 811(2)(b). In undertaking this
exercise, the Tribunal notes that the ordinary meaning of the word ‘rare’ in the context of ‘a
rare event’ is one which seldom occurs, is unusual, uncommon, or exceptional (as detailed
in the Oxford English Dictionary). Whilst the Oxford English Dictionary does not provide
a definition of the word ‘severe’ in the context of a ‘severe’ measure, common uses of the
word in such a context connote “something bad or undesirable”, “harsh”, “brutal”, “serious”
or “grave” and the addition of the word ‘so’ before ‘severe’ emphasises the extreme nature
of the severity contemplated. Accordingly, for the Challenged Measures to comprise an
actionable indirect expropriation, as opposed to a legitimate exercise of a State’s police
powers, there must be a very significant aggravating element or factor in the conduct of the

State and not just a bureaucratic muddle or State inefficiency.

The Challenged Measures were clearly implemented to protect the paramo ecosystem. There
was a recognised need to protect these ecosystems which was first highlighted a significant

time before Concession 3452 was granted, as can be seen from the following:

a. Article 79 of Colombia’s (Green) Political Constitution imposes on the State a legal

duty to conserve areas of special ecological importance.
b. In 1992 Colombia signed the Biodiversity Convention.

c. In 1993 Colombia enacted the General Environmental Law (Law 99 of 1993) which

provided that paramos were to be the subject of special protection.

d. In 1996 it ratified the Biodiversity Convention and in 1998 it ratified the

Ramsar Convention.

270/387

e. A “Programme for the Restoration and Sustainable Management of High
Colombian Mountain Ecosystems: PARAMOS” was launched in 2001 and
published in February 2002,° framed in accordance with the General
Environmental Principles of the General Environmental Law. This programme was
contained in a lengthy document which detailed the important cultural and
economic functions fulfilled by the paramos and specified the aim of “special
protection of pdramos, sub-pdramos, springs and aquifer replenishing zones.”
Pursuant to Article 2.1, the general objective was “[t]o provide national, regional
and local orientation for environmental management of Paramo ecosystems and
promote actions for their sustainable management and restoration [...].” Article
2.2 detailed the specific objectives including, inter alia: “Perform environmental
zoning and planning of the paramo ecosystems at a regional and local level and
implement environmental management plans with an ecological approach” and
“[p]romote the conservation of paramo ecosystems on the basis of ecologically,
socially, and economically sustainable forms of land use.” Article 1.1 of the
General Environmental Law referred to the relevance of the Rio principles,
Principle 15 of which contained the precautionary principle (namely that “[w]here
there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty
shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent
environmental degradation’’) which was enshrined into Colombian Law by Article
1.6 and Article 1.4 of the General Environmental Law providing that “the paramo
and sub paramo areas, water springs and aquifer recharge zones shall be the

subject of special protection.”°”

f. The Ministry of Environment Resolution 769 (dated 5 August 2002) was issued
titled “Establishing provisions for paramo protection, preservation and
sustainability” pursuant to which MinAmbiente established a legal definition of
“Paramo.” In particular it (i) identified the paramos it applied to as being those on

the western cordillera from approximately 3300 masl, on the central cordillera from

approximately 3700 masl, on the eastern cordillera from approximately 3000 masl
and in any other regions from approximately 3300 mas]; (ii) noted that paramos
comprise three strips (the sub-paramo, the paramo itself and the superparamo); and
(iii) noted that it included man-altered paramos. Article 3 provided for regional
studies to be completed within one year of terms of reference being established
detailing, inter alia, their geographical location and cartographic distribution and
using GPS to ascertain the Gauss-Kruger and latitude-longitude coordinates and
reporting on the current condition of the paramos in that region with the support of,
inter alia, the [AvH and to prepare an Environmental Management Plan containing,

inter alia, zoning and environmental organisation of paramos.

g. On 13 July 2004 CORPONOR created the Regional System of Protected Natural
Areas for the Department of Norte de Santander which was specified to include

“the paramo areas, sub-pdramos, springs, and aquifer recharge areas.”°™*

Therefore, both at the time Concession 3452 was originally entered into in 2007 and at the
time the FTA came into force in 2011, well before the Challenged Measures were enacted,
there was already significant understanding and awareness of the importance of protecting
the paramo and its fragility. Indeed, Eco Oro should have been aware of this at the time it
made its original investment in 1994. The intended purpose of the Challenged Measures as
designed and applied is therefore clearly bona fide, even if all the necessary measures to

achieve the underlying purpose have not yet been finally implemented.

The Tribunal next considers the manner in which the paramo ecosystem was delimited.
Was it proportionate given its purpose? Whilst the Parties do not disagree as to the
importance of protecting the paramo ecosystem, they disagree both as to the criteria to be
applied in determining the boundaries of the Santurban Paramo and as to whether the
delimitation was in accordance with the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code.

In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Annex 811(2)(b) does not impose an obligation to

CORPONOR, Directing Council Agreement No. 11 (13 July 2004) (Exhibit R-143).

272/387

647.

648.

comply with such domestic laws, although it is a relevant factor to consider in ascertaining

the bona fides of the measures.

The IAvH’s study was the basis for the delimitation applied in the Challenged Measures.
Whilst it is accepted by both experts that there is no single definition of a paramo, there is
substantial agreement on the essential elements of the paramo. The main differences with
respect to the boundaries of the paramo are, firstly, where the lower boundary of the paramo
is to be delimited and, in particular, whether the transition area (the “Transition Zone”) is
to be treated as paramo and, secondly, whether those areas which no longer exhibit the
typical characteristics and functions of a paramo can be described as paramo or not: Eco Oro

says no to both and Colombia says yes to both.

The Tribunal found both Parties’ experts to be honest and credible with respect to the
importance of protecting the paramo. Ms. Baptiste is of the opinion that it is important to
include the Transition Zone to ensure complete protection whereas Mr. Aldana took an
arguably more technical definition of the paramo. It is not unusual for scientists to disagree
but the Tribunal did not find either to be seeking to promote the interests of the Party which
had appointed them. In considering the relevance of including the Transition Zone in the
delimitation of the paramo, the Tribunal finds of assistance the following statement from the

Constitutional Court in Judgment C-35:

“Then, as we can see, the criteria on which different scientists have relied to
define the paramo differ, not only in quantitative terms —regarding their
altitude above sea level— but also in qualitative terms —as to the factors or
elements used to define the paramo. Some scientists adopt merely operative
definitions, such as the location between forest ecosystems and eternal snow,
while others add elements such as, inter alia, the type of vegetation, latitude
and geological morphology. These definitions pose a challenge to
delimitation -hence to the protection of these ecosystems. Yet some points of
the definition converge, which are related to the ecological functions or
services provided by these ecosystems, facilitating the adoption of some
delimitation criteria. As we will see below, these ecological functions or
services are the most efficient criterion in furtherance of certain legal
interests that are protected by the constitution.

[J

273/387

Two services stand out among the different environmental services provided
by the paramos, which are fundamental to society. On the one hand, paramos
are a cornerstone of the regulation of the water cycle (in terms of quality and
availability), for they collect and provide drinking water of high quality and
easy distribution. On the other, paramos are carbon ‘sinks’, that is they store
and capture carbon from the atmosphere at least ten times as much as
tropical forests, according to the most conservative calculations, contributing
to mitigating the effects of global warming.

[The Constitutional Court then summarises the qualities of the paramos in performing these

services:]

“After studying the characteristics and the main environmental services
provided by paramos, we should indicate that ecosystems are not to be
understood in a fragmented manner. In the case being analysed by the Court,
the functioning of the pdramo cannot be understood in isolation from that of
the forests that surround it along the lower parts, since these two ecosystems
interact with, and depend on, each other. This has been recognised by the
CBD, which defines an ecosystem as ‘[...] a dynamic complex of plant,
animal and micro-organism communities and their non-living environment
interacting as a functional unit.’

To the extent that the different resources that form part of the paramo serve
specific functions to the biological and chemical processes that develop in
them, the scope of the measures to protect this ecosystem cannot be
determined by a single criterion, for example their altitude, or the presence
of frailejones. Likewise impacts on the ecosystem cannot be analysed in
isolation, for an impact on the soil or on biological diversity may also result
in an impact on water.

In addition, paramos should not be considered independent ecosystems, for
they are closely related with the other adjacent ecosystems such as forests,
mainly in connection with water. [...].”°"

649. The extract cited above from Judgment C-35 demonstrates the difficulties in reaching a

675

commonly agreed definition of a paramo ecosystem and whether the Transition Zone should
be encompassed within the ecosystem boundaries. It is clear from this that Colombia’s
alternative approach to determining the correct boundary of the paramo does not of itself

equate to male fides.

The Constitutional Court further noted in Judgment T-361 that:

“The right to environmental participation is reinforced in the paramos
governance. This is due to the fact that such biomes are of great importance
to the legal®”® system because: (i) they are an ecosystem featuring great
diversity that needs to be preserved; and (ii) they offer environmental services
that are most significant for society life, such as the regulation of the
hydrologic cycle and the sequestration of atmospheric carbon.

In turn that biome is exposed to multiple disturbances that can destroy it, such
as crop farming, animal farming, mining or global warming, which processes
would bring societal wellbeing levels down. Therefore, it is necessary to
adopt tools that will preserve such natural environments: delimitation is an
example of such environmental management. However, the protection of
paramo ecosystems stands as a difficult task due to the debate concerning the
concept of paramos and the delimitation of the boundaries separating
paramos from the upper Andean forest. In view of this situation, paramo
management should seek the sustainability of such ecological niches and take
into consideration paramo interactions with other natural environments.
An example of this is the inclusion of the forest paramo buffer zone (FPBZ)
within its boundaries.”

Mr. Aldana says that once there has been a disturbance in the Transition Zone, the paramo
species descend and take over the areas previously occupied by the forest (paramisation) but
the paramised area does not normally have the composition, structure and functions of a
paramo and so may not be considered as paramo. Further, the Angostura area was an area
where there had been significant intervention as a result of intensive development for
hundreds of years of different activities such as grazing, agriculture and felling as well as

traditional mining.

. Ms. Baptiste on the other hand says that a paramo ecosystem should include areas which

have been transformed by human activity: ecosystems are socio-ecological systems and it is
not possible to proceed on the basis that a paramo ecosystem loses its nature when it has
interacted with human activity. The question of whether or not to include the Transition

Zone in the paramo depends on the definition adopted for the ecosystem, and “[n]o objective

 

The Tribunal notes the use in the English translation of the word “/egal”: this is the same as in the Spanish
original where the text also refers to the legal system. The provision is as follows: “El derecho de la
participacién ambiental se refuerza en la gobernanza que recae sobre los paramos. Lo anterior, en razén de
que ese bioma reviste gran importancia para el Sistema juridico {...].”

response exists to the question of whether the transition zone is part of the adjacent
ecosystem.” The IAvH believed the transition strip should be included as paramo as they
are areas of maximum biological diversity in the high mountains and a key element for the
paramos’ water regulation function. They also protect the connectivity between the paramo
and the forest, preventing the isolation of certain species. This is consistent with the
definition adopted by MinAmbiente in Resolution 769 of 2002 and “from the ecological
point of view, boundaries or limits correspond more precisely to transition zones. Delimiting

1

an ecosystem, including this sition area with ecosystems, permits the protection

of flows between ecosystems and thus guarantees comprehensive protection.”°”*

Ms. Baptiste confirmed in her testimony that the [AvH provided MinAmbiente with a strip
representing the Transition Zone together with a line that was the outside border of the
transitional strip to protect it as much as possible. This required some, albeit minimal, field
data and was effected by means of a probabilistic model with certain specific data.
Ms. Baptiste further confirmed that the Transition Zone was subject to a slight degree of
uncertainty (in an interview she confirmed it could move 50 meters up or 100 meters down)

but that the IAVH recommended line maximised protection for the Transition Zone.

Given the evidence from both experts and as noted by the Constitutional Court, it is clear
paramos require protection and it is also clear that once damaged it is uncertain whether
ornot they can be restored and, if so, the length of time such restoration will take.
Whilst Eco Oro says that the precautionary principle is not applicable, it seems to the
Tribunal that this is precisely the circumstance in which this principle —as for example
reflected in the preamble to the 1992 Biodiversity Convention and set out in Principle 15 of
the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development- does apply. As discussed above,
concern with respect to the fragility of paramo ecosystems and the need to ensure “special
protection” has been expressed since before Concession 3452. The Constitutional Court
references a number of studies and reports authored by public and private entities which
conclude that “pdramo ecosystems are very fragile and that mining may have negative

consequences on the vegetation cover and geomorphological, chemical and physical

changes in the soil and subsoil [...].°°”

and then summarises the “vulnerability, fragility
and capacity for recovery of the pdéramo ecosystem.”°° The precautionary principle is
clearly relevant when considering the effect and proportionality of the measures with respect

to the protection of the paramos.

Whilst the Tribunal does not, for the purposes of this Decision, need to reach a determination
of whether such a delimitation should or should not include the Transition Zone, it can
conclude that it was certainly not unreasonable for the Transition Zone to have been included
when delimiting the Santurban Paramo, having regard to the precautionary principle. This is
particularly the case in a circumstance such as this where (i) there is no certainty as to the
damage that could be caused by mining activities and whether or not such damage would be
irreversible and (ii) if not irreversible, the time it would take for the paramo to regenerate.
The Tribunal further recognises the importance, as explained by the Constitutional Court, of
ensuring the paramo is both able to interconnect with other ecosystems to ensure it can fulfil
its environmental services but equally is protected from any potential adverse interaction
with another natural environment. Accordingly, whether or not the delimitation was
conducted in accordance with Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code, it cannot be said to be
disproportionate in terms of its purpose of protecting the paramo ecosystem to include the
Transition Zone in the delimited area. The Tribunal considers below whether or not
Colombia’s failure to re-delimit the Santurban Paramo as ordered by the Constitutional Court

was proportionate.

The Tribunal therefore does not find that including the Transition Zone in the Santurban
Paramo was unreasonable or evidences a lack of good faith, and cannot be said to amount

an exercise of State power that is characterised by bad faith.

The Tribunal next turns to consider how the IAvH undertook its task of determining the
lower boundary line of the Santurban Paramo, specifically its lack of field studies. Whilst
the Tribunal understands Eco Oro’s reservations given the impact of the IAvH’s

determination on Concession 3452, it does not find the work undertaken by IAVH to have

been undertaken in breach of its agreed methodology. The study appears to have followed
the methodology which (along with the proposal for the delimitation for the Santurban
Paramo) was contained in the Contributions Document.®*! This was published in 2014

together with Resolution 2090.

The executive summary prepared by Mr. Sarmiento notes that the aim of the document is to
“provid|[e] elements of judgement in biophysical, legal and social aspects that contribute to
the delimitation at 1:25,000 scale of the [Santurban Paramo], performed by the pertinent
authorities. In this respect, this document is a contribution requested by the environmental
authority, after the formal delivery of the studies, and in accordance with the legislation.”
Ms. Baptiste confirmed that this document was a “concept”, being technical in nature and
fully backed up by the quality of the scientists that issued it. Ms. Baptiste further confirmed
that the IAVH was asked by MinAmbiente to “contribute its capabilities, [...] research in
connection with biodiversity and ecosystems. But it also has — this also has to do with the
conditions in the communities and related to the people in the circumstances”.
She explained that the I[AVH “worked with the people as well. We worked describing very
well the conditions of infrastructure, demographics, population matters. These are factors
that cannot be ascended from ecology [...]. We assessed all the work that had been
developed in connection with mining, history and the region. [...] There shouldn't be
individuals that are adversely affected and improperly affected so we have documents. We
conducted a very careful set of works to work with the persons and this apart from the other
activities we conducted in the Santurban Paramo.” Ms. Batiste confirmed that this was “[t]o
determine the level of presence of persons, what kinds of activities there are” and she noted
that she referred to these reports in her statement (paragraphs 38 onwards) such that there
were brief references to this work in the reports and the content was to be found in the 2014

Contributions Document.**?

This 2014 methodology did not refer to the necessity of undertaking new field studies,

although it does provide for the use of field work studies that had previously been

IAVH, “Contributions to the delimitation of the paramo” (2014) (Exhibit C-194).

undertaken. The Tribunal notes that the methodology was peer-approved and that the only

criticism it has been referred to is that from Mr. Aldana.

Whilst Eco Oro criticises the study undertaken by the IAvH for not including any field
studies, the Tribunal notes that a requirement for field studies was only included in a later
methodology, the Forest-Paramo Transition Conceptual Framework (the “Forest-Paramo
Transition”) and was not provided for in the Contributions Document methodology.
The Tribunal understands that this may well have been because the Santurban Paramo
delimitation was a pilot exercise and the 2015 document contained a revised methodology
partially updated to take account of lessons learnt from undertaking the Santurban Paramo

delimitation to be used in the subsequent delimitations.

The Tribunal also finds it understandable that Colombia did not follow a different
methodology to give effect to any desire to ensure that the Angostura Deposit was
not included in the delimited paramo. Any methodology applied to the area in
Concession 3452 would have had to be applied to all other affected concessions and, given
Colombia’s stated insufficient resources, it is understandable that this could not be
undertaken. The Tribunal also accepts Colombia’s evidence that it could not have accepted
the ECODES Report; it would have been inappropriate to expect Colombia to follow a
different methodology with respect to the area overlapping with Concession 3452 or to adopt
the delimitation prepared by Eco Oro’s own expert in a situation where there were a further
approximately 64 titles affected by the delimitation exercise. Firstly, the [AvH needed to
follow a methodology that could be applied homogenously across all the paramos to be
delineated, to ensure integrity in the delimitation process. Secondly, the IAvH could not
have been seen to have adopted a concessionaire’s own report or accepted findings from Eco
Oro which could have been said to have compromised IAvH’s impartiality and scientific
integrity. The ECODES Report could also have been perceived as being self-serving,
although the Tribunal emphasises that it found Mr. Aldana to be a genuine and honest
witness and it was clear that the ECODES Report had been prepared with considerable

resources and professionalism.

In conclusion, the Tribunal does not find that the [AvH’s work in preparing its proposal of
the Santurban Paramo delimitation was not bona fide and certainly there is no evidence that
the manner in which it was undertaken was so severe that it cannot be reasonably be viewed
as having been adopted in good faith. The Tribunal found Ms. Baptiste to be a compelling
and honest witness. IAvH followed the 2014 methodology. The Tribunal appreciates that
given the sizeable area of the Santurban Paramo there could have been shortages of logistical
and financial resources preventing field studies being undertaken in the totality of the area
to be delimited. It is clear that there are different views as to what a paramo comprises, but
the Tribunal did not see any evidence that the exercise undertaken by the [AvVH was done
other than in a genuine attempt to determine the paramo boundaries in the prevailing
circumstances. The Tribunal has sympathy with Eco Oro’s submissions that had field visits
been undertaken the delimitation may have been different and that had the margin of error
been applied in Eco Oro’s favour, the Angostura Deposit would not have been subject to the
mining exclusion zone, however the Tribunal has to balance that with the enormity of the
task which had to be undertaken, the difficulties in defining the paramo ecosystem as
summarised by the Constitutional Court and the importance of protecting the paramo
ecosystem. Whilst a wide boundary of the Transition Zone was included, considering that
(i) damage to the ecosystem has very significant adverse effects; (ii) it is unknown whether
damaged paramo ecosystem can be restored but that even if it can be restored, the length of
time to achieve this is significant; and (iii) underground as well as open pit mining is believed
to be a threat to the paramo ecosystem, the Tribunal does not find that there was any
arbitrariness, unreasonableness or capriciousness in the way that the I[AvH proposed the

Resolution 2090 delimitation.

Whilst the Tribunal does not find reason for significant criticism of the manner in which the
IAvH undertook its studies, it is, however, more troubled by the manner in which the

delimitation was declared by MinAmbiente.

The Tribunal first notes the dearth of evidence that any form of reliable social and economic
studies were undertaken in compliance with the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001
Mining Code. Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code required delimitation “by the

environmental authority on the basis of technical, social and environmental studies with the

280/387

686

687

688

collaboration of the mining authority.” It is further stated that the administrative act by
which any exclusion zone is established must be “expressly based on studies that establish
the incompatibility of or need to restrict mining activities.”®*° In addition, Law 1450 added
the necessity for an economic study in addition to the technical, social and environmental

studies required when undertaking a delimitation of the paramo.

The Tribunal has reservations as to the legitimacy or adequacy of the social and economic
studies that had to be undertaken; the only evidence that was adduced being the reference in

a document titled “Technical Specifications for the Territory's Comprehensive Management

for the Conservation of the Paramo Jurisdicciones — Santurban — Berlin. Incorporation of

Social and Economic Aspects” (the “Memoria Técnica”).°°° Whilst Colombia says that the
socioeconomic inputs are “described in detail’®’ in this Memoria Técnica, which

accompanied Resolution 2090, the document merely states as follows:

“The water that originates in the ‘Paramo Complex Jurisdictions —Santurban
— Berlin’ supplies the Zulia River Basin — which supplies the district of Riego
Asozulia, which groups 1,400 associated bodies of water with a concession
of 14.3 m3/s —and supports various activities: agricultural uses, the Tasajero
thermal power station, and water supply for the population. Only in the
Bucaramanga Metropolitan Area, the number of users of these waters for
human consumption comes to one million. 30 percent of the water for the city
of Cucurta comes from the paramo complex.

Additionally, they emphasise that if the complex’s area of regional influence
is defined based on seven hydrographic subzones, it consists of
68 municipalities in which approximately 2,500,000 people benefit directly
or indirectly from the water sources that originate from there.”°**

Colombia provided no further evidence detailing the substance of the studies undertaken,
despite being ordered to produce this. Whilst the document referred to above suggests that

some technical, social and economic studies were undertaken, the Tribunal would have

anticipated, if not the level of detail as was undertaken by the IAVH with respect to the
environmental and technical aspects of the delimitation exercise, at least more sophisticated
studies than appear to have been carried out as identified in the Technical Report. Indeed,
Colombia itself accepts that there was significant criticism of the social and economic

aspects of the delimitation, but not of the scientific exercise undertaken by [AvH.**?

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Colombia says that the social and economic studies are specified
at page three of Resolution 2090 and pages five to eleven of the Technical Report. Colombia
says it provided these reports to Eco Oro during the document production stage, including
the following: (i) studies prepared by the CDMB and CORPONOR assessing the physical,
biological and socio-economic features of the paramo; (ii) corine land covers (being maps
showing land cover in the areas identified as being paramo); and (iii) the information used
by MinAmbiente to map the preservation, restoration and sustainable use areas of the
Santurban Paramo.®° These documents are not on the record and the Tribunal is therefore

unable to clarify the level of detail or utility of such reports.

Colombia, in its response to Eco Oro with respect to Eco Oro’s document production request
seeking “documents demonstrating how, and the extent to which, the Ministry of
Environment ‘factored social and economic criteria into the delimitation’ of the Santurban

paramo” advised as follows:°!

“The social and economic criteria taken into consideration by the Ministry of
Environment to conduct the delimitation of the paramo are set out

Regarding the Claimant’s allegations concerning the alleged deficiencies of
Colombia's document production in Request No. 6, Colombia notes the
following.

First, the ‘technical, economic, social and environmental studies for the
delineation of the Santurban paramo submitted by the CDMB to the Ministry
of Environment filed under number (radicado) 4120-E1-57045’ requested by
the Claimants under Request 6(a) were in fact produced by Colombia under
Request No. 3 [...]. The IAVH (and not the Ministry of Environment) relied
on these documents to prepare its proposal for the delimitation of the paramo.
No other documents responsive to this request exist.

[...]
[...] Colombia confirms that, after an appropriate search within the relevant

State entities, it was unable to locate the attachments to letter
20141000413491 from the ANM to the Ministry of Environment.

283/387

[...] Colombia did not produce any of the documents referenced in ‘page 38
of Exhibit C-217’ (Request No. 6(g)) because Exhibit C-217 is simply a Power
Point presentation prepared by the Ministry of Environment outlining the
paramo delimitation process. As di: d above, Resolution 2090 and the
Memoria Técnica comprehensively include the technical, social and
economic information used by the Ministry of Environment to conduct the
delimitation of the Santurban paramo. No information outside that listed in
these two documents was used for the delimitation of the paramo. The
information referenced in page 38 of Exhibit C-217, but was not included in
Resolution 2090 or the Memoria Técnica, does not constitute ‘socio-
economic criteria taken into account for the delimitation’ and is therefore not
responsive to request No. 6(g).

In particular, the ‘studies to determine the economic value or ecosytems
prepared by Fedesarrollo, the Universidad Industrial de Santander — UIS,
among others’ are not referenced in Resolution 2090 and the Memoria
Técnica. The Ministry of Environment reviewed but ultimately did not rely
on these studies for the delimitation of the paramo. Colombia did not produce
these studies because they are not responsive to the Claimant’s request.

[oJ

669. It appears to the Tribunal clear from this response that:

a. the only social and economic criteria relied upon by MinAmbiente is that which
was set out “comprehensively” in the Memoria Técnica, however the information

contained therein is extremely sparse;

b. the underlying information cited in the Memoria Técnica and listed in Colombia’s
response to Eco Oro’s document production request is that which was listed
(and quoted in the preceding paragraph) which appears to consist predominantly of

biogeophysical data as opposed to social and economic data;

c. the “technical, economic, social and environmental studies for the delineation of
the Santurban paramo” submitted by the CDMB were relied upon by the IAvH in
preparing its proposal for the delimitation of the paramo — they were not relied upon

by MinAmbiente; and

d. no other documents responsive to Eco Oro’s request exist.

284/387

670. In this regard, the Tribunal also recalls that Ms. Baptiste confirmed in her oral testimony that

692

693

694

the IAvH’s capabilities extended to “research in connection with the biodiversity and
ecosystems” which extended to “conditions in the communities and related to the people in

the circumstances”®”

which entailed “work[ing] with the people as well. We worked on
describing very well the conditions of infrastructure, demographics, population matters.
These are factors that cannot be ascended from ecology. [...] We assessed all the work that
had been developed in connection with mining, history, and the region.”®? Ms. Baptiste
further confirmed that the nature of this type of work undertaken by IAvH was as described
“in the guide to disseminate the criteria for delimitation, well it defines three elements. This
is at page 15, biogeophysical criteria for identifying the lower strip or the lower part of the
ecosystem; the criteria of ecological integrity which define a reference area, which implies
a connected and integral ecosystem; and, finally, socioeconomic and cultural elements
which imply, considering the impact on the paramo of the presence of communities and their
systems of production, considering also the areas of the paramo that have been totally or
partially transformed, are the areas that have been ‘paramised.’ In all the documents of the
[IAvH], there were always chapters and materials concerning the social and economic
conditions in the zone. [...] The first document where [the conclusion] is to be found
explicitly is that on methodology, which I just explained, and then in the final reports that
were produced for delimitation of the paramo [Contributions Document].” Ms. Baptiste
then confirmed that all the elements she had described were contained in the final report, the
Contributions Document.®* Upon being taken to paragraph 40 of her first statement where
she stated that “social and economic aspects have no technical impact on the ecosystemic
analysis” Ms. Baptiste explained that: “[i]¢ is very important that the social and economic
aspects do not become algorithms for constructing the proposal for a delimitation because
they always entail specific interests. And in this way, the ecological line on the identification
of the paramo could have become very chaotic. It wouldn’t have been possible to draw or

propose a line. In any event what the Institute provides is a reference area, a reference line,

wo

for the Ministry, I reiterate, as we begin to incorporate or consider the social and economic

issues in keeping with its policies.”°°

The Tribunal understands from Ms. Baptiste’s evidence that whilst the IAVH did consider
social and economic studies, it was solely for the purpose of undertaking its ecosystemic
analysis as to the correct technical study as to the boundaries of the paramo. It was for
MinAmbiente to review economic and social studies before determining the delimitation to

be published in compliance with Article 34.

Minister Sarmiento, in her testimony, confirmed that the technical study required by
Article 202 of Law 1450 was the final IAvH report, the Contributions Document.”
However she accepted she had no knowledge of the required economic study.” With
respect to the requisite social study, Minister Sarmiento explained her knowledge was
limited to the following: different minutes were drawn up and a document was drawn up
with the University of Los Andes as a result of meetings and there were also meetings with
miners, farmers and the women of the Santurban Paramo (led by Minister Sarmiento).
However, she confirmed she was not aware of a single document that comprised the social
study, explaining that the social aspect was included in a number of documents. Indeed, she
explained that whether the women of the Santurban Paramo could be paid for environmental

services was a part of the economic aspect that she covered.°*

Whilst Minister Sarmiento explained that the boundary line drawn for the lower altitudinal
level was based exclusively on environmental and technical considerations, stating that

“[t]he social and economic criteria do not delimit or cannot be part of the delimitation of an

7699

ecosystem”®”” she then explained that the delimitation was a “complete exercise” as the State

“could not set aside the impact that might happen on the paramo, particularly the social

concerns around this limitation.”” The State had to strike a balance in circumstances where

there was confrontation between the people of the paramo and the people living in
Bucaramanga and whilst “the technical line is an ecosystem matter, but the State needs to
take into consideration, among its obligations, how to handle the special and economic
situation of the persons living there, particularly when there was such a high level of conflict
and so many threats that we are -- were seeing in this regard.””' She continued by saying
that the process was not just about drawing the technical line, for the State “it is an economic
and social issue because it is an issue that goes to, overall, or integral development, which

is what one always seeks in dealing with such matters.”"

Drawing the boundary line was
part of a development question and, as such, social and economic actions would also have
been taken as it is an integral process, also requiring consensus building and coordination
with the mayors of the regions directly impacted. Having received the proposal from the
JAvH, they received further inputs and so “moved step by step both on the technical side and

social side.”

Minister Sarmiento also explained that the involvement of MinMinas and the ANM was
limited to participation in some meetings with the IAvH, that the Minister of Mines had
attended one such meeting, and MinMinas and the ANM had provided some plans and

documents. ”4

Minister Sarmiento testified that she visited “on a weekly basis, [...] with the communities,
the most vulnerable Parties, the ones that were going to be affected the most with the
delimitation [and] organised the issue around the youth and women [and] started several
processes with the miners [and] met on a weekly basis with the Mayors and also with
[Eco Oro].””°> However again the documentary evidence of economic and social studies
was extremely limited and no documentary evidence was adduced demonstrating any

collaboration of the mining authority.

676. The Tribunal further notes the criticisms levelled by the Constitutional Court at the Minister
of Environment for the lack of public consultation undertaken. The Constitutional Court

explained as follows:

“the [MinAmbiente] has been vested by law with discretionary planning —
regulatory/law-making powers to delimit paramos [...]. This power entails a
flexible subjection to the legal system, as the authority enjoys freedom in
performing such function, to an extent such that the administration need only
wait for the maps prepared by the IAvH and is allowed to deviate from them
if it provides a justifying reason aimed at protecting the paramo niche.
However, the exercise of such discretionary powers is controlled by the legal
system and does not entail a scenario where no law applies. In actual fact,
in the paramo delimitation proceedings, the authorities are bound by basic
rights and other constitutional principles such as the imperatives of
optimising proportionality and reasonableness.

 

Illustrating this premise, the Ministry must guarantee the following
parameters: (i) distributive justice i.e. an equal allocation of environmental
burdens in the region of the Santurban massif; (ii) participation in the
lelimitation pr ding and the ing, impli ion and e ion of
measures affecting people; (iii) sustainable development through territory
classification and the authorization or banning of activities; and (iv) the
application of the precautionary principle in managing the area's
environment.

 

In connection with environmental participation, this Division notes that it
must guarantee the principle’s normative contents, which criteria were
specified [above]. We even outlined the specifics of such right in paramo
delimitation [...]. These include: (i) access to public information; (ii) public
and deliberative participation by the community; and (iii) the availability of
administrative and judicial remedies to enforce such rights.”

677. The Constitutional Court held that MinAmbiente had not respected the principle of
good faith by having denied protection of the rights to environmental participation, failed to
provide access to information and not ensured the community’s active and deliberative
participation. This finding supports the Tribunal’s concerns as to the manner in which

MinAmbiente enacted the delimitation.

678. Considering the above, the Tribunal does not accept that the delimitation exercise undertaken
by the MinAmbiente was compliant with the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining
Code and Law 1450. However, whilst MinAmbiente was found by the Constitutional Court
not to have respected the principle of good faith under domestic law in certain respects in

288/387

679.

confirming the delimitation, the Tribunal finds by a majority that this does not mean the
Challenged Measures themselves are of a sufficiently egregious nature to comprise a lack of
bona fides on the part of Colombia. The importance of protecting the paramo ecosystems is
unquestionable and there was no doubting the genuine motivation of those responsible to
protect the environment. The purpose of the Challenged Measures is clearly not in bad faith
and MinAmbiente’s breaches in failing to consult were not directed towards Eco Oro but to
the local farmers and miners. Thus, whilst the execution of the measures was not carried out
in compliance with the domestic law requirements, the Tribunal does not find that such non-
compliance, in itself, is sufficient to constitute a lack of bona fides on the part of Colombia,
viewed in the context of the bona fide purpose of the measures and the bona fides of the

TAvH in undertaking its analysis.

When considering the proportionality of the Challenged Measures, given the Angostura
Deposit only overlapped with 0.09% of the delimited Santurban Paramo the Tribunal can
understand that moving the boundary, so as to ensure the Angostura Deposit was not subject
to the mining ban, would seem to Eco Oro a minor and insignificant change. However, the
Tribunal does not accept that it was disproportionate of Colombia not to move the boundary
to ensure there was no overlapping with the concession area, or not to undertake field studies
to verify the delimitation where it overlapped with the Santurban Paramo. To undertake this
with respect to Concession 3452 would have required Colombia to follow an alternative and
unapproved methodology just for the area comprising Concession 3452, potentially to the
detriment of other concession holders and other interested parties who were affected by the
2090 Atlas. Whilst the Tribunal appreciates that for Eco Oro the overlap with Concession
3452 was an insignificant part of the delimitation, the consequential ramifications could have
been significant and it would have been in breach of the IAvH’s integrity to change the
limitation boundaries in one specific area to benefit one party. The Tribunal also accepts
Ms. Baptiste’s evidence that they did not have the resources to carry out the same field study
checks in all areas subject to delimitation and again it would have been incorrect for the
IAvH solely to carry out field studies in areas where concerns had been raised by one affected

concessionaire.

A further criticism is that even to this day the Santurban Paramo has not been finally
delimited giving rise to considerable uncertainty. Whilst it is certainly correct that it has still
not been delimited and Colombia must accept responsibility for this, it does not mean that
the Challenged Measures themselves are disproportionate in the light of their purpose to
protect the paramos. It has not been argued by Eco Oro that the paramos are not deserving
of protection, the issue is whether the Challenged Measures are a proportionate way to

achieve this.

In considering the Annex 811(2)(a) factors in carrying out this exercise, the Tribunal also
considers whether the Challenged Measures interfered with any distinct reasonable
investment-backed expectations. To determine this the Tribunal follows the test applied by
the tribunals in Methanex and Oxus: did the State give specific commitments that it would
refrain from the acts complained of. A distinct reasonable investment-backed expectation
cannot be the same as a legitimate expectation and the Tribunal agrees with the answer given
by Mr. Pape to Professor Sands at the Hearing that there must be an obligation on an investor
claiming that its reasonable investment-backed expectations has been breached, to have
undertaken its own due diligence before relying on any encouragement or support given by

the Government in making its investment.’

. Whilst the Tribunal appreciates that the individual permits were obtained a significant time

17°” such that it

ago and that Eco Oro had changed its corporate identity and direction in 201
is not unreasonable that there may not now be any records of due diligence undertaken, even
the most cursory due diligence even before Concession 3452 was granted would have
revealed (i) the potential existence of a paramo ecosystem within the boundaries of
Concession 3452; (ii) the Government’s commitment and obligation to protect these

ecosystems; and (iii) that such protection could be achieved by the imposition of a mining

ban. 78 Indeed, Eco Oro’s own initial reports acknowledged the presence of paramos within

its concession area.”

The potential applicability of the precautionary principle to the paramo should also have
been understood by Eco Oro. The precautionary principle was enshrined into
Colombian Law by Article 1.6 of the General Environmental Law and Article 1.4 of the
same Law states that “the paramo and sub paramo areas, water springs and aquifer
recharge zones shall be the subject of special protection.” Constitutional Court Judgment
C-293 of 2002 upheld the constitutionality of the precautionary principle such that private
rights, including acquired rights, are not violated “if/ as a consequence of a decision made
by an environmental authority that, applying the precautionary principle, within the limits
enshrined by the legal provision itself, decides to suspend the work or activity carried out by
a private person, by way of a grounded administrative act, harm or hazard to renewable

resources or human health derives therefrom, even in the absence of any absolute scientific

evidence to that effect.”

In considering the consequences of this judgement, Professor Ricaurte accepted
“as impeccable reasoning” Professor Sands’ summary that any investor would have known
that the general right of the State to act to protect the environment prevails over the narrower
particular right of the investor where the State’s resources are at issue and that a lawyer

advising a reasonable investor would have had to say “J’m bound to alert you to the

Some examples include: Colombia’s (Green) Political Constitution, Article 79 which imposes on the State a
legal duty to conserve areas of special ecological importance; the Biodiversity Convention; the General
Environmental Law which provided that paramos were to be the subject of special protection; the Biodiversity
Convention; the Ramsar Ct ion; the P for the ion and inabl of High

possibility that, because you are investing in an area that concerns nonrenewable resource,
you are subject to an overriding interest of the State to protect other interests, including

environmental interests.”™"!

Therefore, at the time Concession 3452 was entered into, there was already significant
understanding and awareness of the importance of protecting the paramo and events
subsequent to Concession 3452 being registered, but prior to the FTA coming into force,
should further have given rise to an awareness on the part of Eco Oro of the potential for
amining exclusion ban to be imposed over a part of Concession 3452. These include

the following:

a. In July 2007 draft Senate Bill 010 of 2007 was introduced to amend parts of the
2001 Mining Code stating that “the five years that have transpired since the
approval of [the 2001 Mining Code] have allowed the detection of deficiencies
which must be corrected and identification of the need to strengthen the Mining

Authority in the exercise of its powers, especially its duty to manage the mining

resources owned by the State in a rational and responsible manner.”"!*

b. The 2007 Atlas had been published which overlapped 54% of Concession 3452.7!

c. On 23 November 2007 CORPONOR and the CDMB created the Berlin Paramo

Renewable Natural Resources Integral Management District.”!*

Tr. Day 4 (Professor Ricaurte), 960:7-15.

Draft Senate Bill No. 010 (1 November 2007) (Exhibit R-50).

The Tribunal notes that the 2007 Atlas was published in May 2007, which was after Concession 3452 was
executed but before it was registered. Whilst Article 50 of the 2001 Mining Code provides that “[iJn order to
be concluded, and for proof thereof, it shall be registered in the National Mining Registry”, the Tribunal also
notes that the timing of this registration is entirely in the hands of Colombia and that, whilst it was not registered
until after the 2007 Atlas was published, it had been executed beforehand, on 8 February 2007. It would be
difficult, therefore, for Colombia to argue that there is any significance to the fact that the 2007 Atlas was
published before Concession 3452 became legally effective given it was published after Eco Oro had entered
into it. It was not suggested that having executed Concession 3452 Eco Oro could have withdrawn from it
without penalty. Equally however it was issued many years before the FTA came into effect.

d. In June 2008 the Santurban-Sisivita Regional Park was created and 7.9% of

Concession 3452 overlapped it.

e. By the time the FTA came into force, Laws 1383 and 1450, Resolution 937, and
the Santurban National Regional Park had been created all of which evidenced the
possibility that the delimitation of the Santurban Paéramo would overlap a

significant area of Concession 3452.

f. There was less than a 0.2% difference between the overlap created by the 2007
Atlas and the 2090 Atlas.

It is also clear that Eco Oro was aware that if a paramo was declared over any part of its
concession, mining activities in such overlapping areas were at risk of no longer be
permitted. This can be seen from the content of a letter dated 7 July 2011 pursuant to which
Eco Oro renounced the part of its concession which overlapped with the Santurban-Sisivita
Regional National Park not only on the basis that “there are no indicators that indicate the
presence of precious metals in that area” but also because of “the impossibility of performing

deeper exploration tasks because this is an environmentally-protected area.”"!>

The Tribunal has determined that Article 46 was not a stabilisation clause and, as found by
the Consejo de Estado in Advisory Opinion 2233 (expressly with respect to Law 1450) laws
may be applied retrospectively without breaching the Constitution where it is for a public
nature such as protection of the environment, albeit that there may be an obligation to pay
compensation. In particular, the Consejo de Estado advised in section 3 of its Advisory
Opinion:

“[...] It can then be concluded for the analyzed case that Section 202 of

Law 1450 of 2011, being an environmental rule of public order and social

interest nature, has immediate general effect and can be applied with

retrospectivity, unless there is a constitutional reason of greater weight that
prevents this or demands its moderation, as will be seen later.”7'®

The Tribunal therefore does not find that Colombia made any specific commitment, either
in the 2001 Mining Code or the Concession itself, that there would be no retrospective
mining exclusion zone imposed on any part of the concession area. Indeed, the reverse was
the case, as can be seen from the Tribunal’s analysis of Articles 34 and 36 of the 2001 Mining
Code and from Judgement C-293 of 2002.

Did Colombia make any other representations that gave rise to distinct, investment-backed
expectations? It is correct that Colombia made representations to Eco Oro as to its support
for the project. It was known by Colombia at the time Concession 3452 was granted to Eco
Oro that the paramo overlapped with the concession area and yet not only was Concession
3452 granted to Eco Oro but Eco Oro also received significant encouragement from a
number of different State bodies that it would be permitted to undertake exploitation
activities throughout its concession area. For example, Eco Oro says that President Santos
expressed his support at a meeting Eco Oro attended with him and his Chief of Staff in
February 2016 during which he encouraged Eco Oro to apply for its environmental licence
as soon as possible so that the Project could be showcased as a post paramo delimitation
success story.’!” Whilst the only evidence of what was apparently said by President Santos
was given by Mr. Moseley-Williams, it was not denied that this meeting took place. Indeed,
two years before Concession 3452 was executed, the Vetas-California Mining District was

created to attract foreign mining investment.

The Project was designated both a PIN and a PINE at various times to enable Eco Oro to
receive “special support” to move the Project forward, as publicly confirmed by the then
Minister of Mines (Mr. Gonzalez) in March 20157'* in the context of Colombia’s efforts to

attract foreign mining investment.

Eco Oro itself received significant encouragement from MinMinas, which was keen to
encourage mining companies to enter into mining concessions as a much-needed

contribution to the country’s economy. As well as actually being awarded Concession 3452,

which clearly anticipated the possibility of exploitation activities in the totality of the
concession area, Eco Oro says it received full support from the Minister of Mines
immediately after the issuance of Resolution 2090,”!° According to Mr. Aldana, the day
after Resolution 2090 was published, the Minister of Mines pledged his full support to assist

Eco Oro in advancing the Project.”

Indeed, Eco Oro attended many meetings with Government officials in preparation for the
environmental licensing process yet at no point did the relevant Government agency give
any indication that the Project would not be possible as a result of the paramo delimitation.
None of these events gave Eco Oro any indication that the Project would not be possible as

aresult of the paramo delimitation.

Even after Judgment C-35 was published, it was clear to Eco Oro that notwithstanding
uncertainty as to its effect, MinAmbiente and MinMinas, the ANM and the Attorney General
still believed that mining activities would be permitted in Concession 3452 and positively

encouraged Eco Oro to maintain that belief.

It is concerning that Eco Oro received such support from parts of the government of
Colombia at a time when Colombia was both well aware of the presence of the paramo within
the concession area and was fully conversant with its obligations to protect the paramo given
its commitment to protect the paramo. However, the Tribunal does not find these
representations constitute specific commitments not to impose a mining exclusion zone in
the area of Concession 3452; rather, they comprised nothing more than general expressions
of support for the project. Given Eco Oro’s apparent failure to undertake any due diligence
before relying on such representations as were made to it by Colombia, the Tribunal does
not find Eco Oro had any distinct reasonable investment backed expectations that
exploitation would be permitted in the entirety of the concession area. The Tribunal
appreciates that Eco Oro’s failure to undertake due diligence would not have enabled it to

predict Colombia’s breach of its own, constitutionally mandated obligations to protect the

paramos, but this per se is not relevant to whether Colombia made a specific commitment to

Eco Oro that it would not subsequently prevent mining in any part of the concession.

The Tribunal finally turns to consider where there are any other circumstances that it should
consider in determining Colombia’s bona fides in designing and implementing the
Challenged Measures. In this regard the Tribunal questions whether Colombia should bear
any responsibility for its role in attracting investments through the enticement of a
concession based on the agreement between the State and a private party in connection with
an activity the legal regime of which is unilaterally controlled by the State and for its actions
in granting Concession 3452. If Eco Oro should have been aware of the presence of paramo,
surely all parts of the State machinery should also have been aware: the Santurban Paramo
was first identified as paramo as early as 1851.7! If Eco Oro is to be criticised for not
understanding the potential implications of generalised statements as to environmental
protection on the scope and validity of its concession rights, prior to entering into the
Concession, so too should Colombia. Colombia should have understood that it should not
grant concession rights over such environmentally sensitive land. If the State did not have

this foresight, it cannot be right to expect Eco Oro to have had it.

Further, surely Colombia should have anticipated (in compliance with its basic political and
social obligations) the clash of interests between different sectors of its population
(as testified by Minister Sarmiento) which in substantial part accounts for the State’s
meandering decisions regarding the paramo. This cannot be held to be the responsibility of
Eco Oro and nor should Eco Oro be penalised for this. Eco Oro could not have anticipated
through due diligence the immense confusion in the applicable legal regime created by the
contradictory State decisions and changing positions of different State organs, including
from the highest courts of the land, on vital State and international environmental matters,
such as the delimitation of the paramo, impacting on a natural resource invaluable for

Colombia and the World.

It is also of concern that as a result of Colombia’s actions having implemented Resolution

2090, there have been instances of illegal mining in the area of Concession 3452 which have

not been prevented by Colombia and which pose a significant threat to the protection of the

paramo.

The Tribunal must weigh in the balance all these factors in determining whether Colombia’s
actions in designing and applying the Challenged Measures were bona fide. Taking a step
backwards, it is clear there was an (inevitable) tension between the needs of environmental
protection and economic development and (as explained by the Consejo de Estado in its
Advisory Opinion 2233) Colombia had to weigh up the balance between the private interest
and the prevalence of the general interest; pursuing the protection of one could not always
similarly protect the other. Does the failure of Colombia at all times to respect its obligations
to preserve and protect the paramo in its interactions with Eco Oro rise to the level of a lack
of bona fides? Whilst it is clear that there may have been failings, at times significant
failings, on the part of Colombian State organs and officials in the manner in which they
have sought to comply with their domestic and international obligations with respect to the
protection of the paramo, the Tribunal’s task under Annex 811(2) is to consider the
Challenged Measures and not to judge Colombia’s actions or its failure to act to preserve the
paramo. As stated by Canada, “[...] bona fide non-discriminatory regulatory measures to
protect the environment even if they are based on precaution (i.e. in dubio pro ambiente)
will ordinarily not require compensation even if they affect the value and/or viability of an
investment of an investor of another Party.”’ The Tribunal accepts that there was a lack
of clarity as to the meaning or effect of Resolution 2090, Judgment C-35, Resolution
VSC 829 and Decision T-361 such that even now there is still no clarity as to whether or not
there is a valid mining exclusion zone over any part of Concession 345 and no final
delimitation of the Santurban Paramo has been effected. The Tribunal also notes that
notwithstanding the Constitutional Court’s ruling in Decision T-361 that the delimitation
carried out could be modified in the event of errors and the direction to delimit the Santurban
Paramo within one year, this has still not been undertaken with the consequence that any
errors which may have had such a deleterious effect on Eco Oro remain uncorrected.
However, the Tribunal asks itself: do these measures amount to a measure that is so severe

in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good

Canada’s Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 11.

faith? By a majority, the Tribunal does not find that the necessary element of severity is
present given the undoubted bona fide purpose of these Challenged Measures and the overall
proportionality of the current boundary of the delimitation when viewed against a reasonable
(albeit not unanimous) scientific conclusion as to the need to include a Transition Zone in
the delimited area, the size of the resulting paramo and the need to adopt a consistent
methodology for the entirety of the area delimited. The fact that this does not result in
compensation, notwithstanding that under Colombian law an acquired right cannot be
expropriated without the payment of compensation, does not mean there was indirect
expropriation for the purposes of Article 811. Given the measures were adopted as a part
of Colombia’s valid and legitimate exercise of its police powers, pursuant to

Annex 811(2)(b), under international law, no compensation is payable.

The majority of the Tribunal therefore does not find the Challenged Measures to have been
so severe that they cannot be reasonably viewed as having been undertaken in good faith.
The majority of the Tribunal finds that they were motivated both by a genuine belief in the
importance of protecting the paramo ecosystem and pursuant to Colombia’s longstanding
legal obligation to protect it. In sum, the Challenged Measures were adopted in good faith,
are non-discriminatory and designed and applied to protect the environment such that they
are a legitimate exercise of Colombia’s police powers and do not constitute indirect

expropriation.

E. ARTICLE 805 OF THE TREATY AND MINIMUM STANDARD OF TREATMENT

700. Article 805 of the Treaty provides as follows:

701.

“(1) Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in
accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of
treatment of aliens, including fair and equitable treatment and full
protection and security. The concepts of ‘fair and equitable treatment’
and ‘full protection and security’ do not require treatment in addition
to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law
minimum standard of treatment of aliens.

(2) The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide ‘fair and equitable treatment’
includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or
administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the
principle of due process.

(3) A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of
this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not
establish that there has been a breach of this Article.”’>
The Tribunal notes that the factual matrix and many of the legal arguments contained in the
Parties’ submissions with respect to Eco Oro’s claim that Colombia is in breach of
Article 805 of the FTA are the same as those referred to in the Parties’ submissions with
respect to Eco Oro’s claim for breach of Article 811. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not
repeat these submissions either in its summary of the Parties’ positions or in its analysis of

the merits of Eco Oro’s claim.

nA

The acts and omissions of the Colombian State referred to above do not comply with
customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including the

obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment (“FET”).

Colombia cannot rely on the content of the Commission’s Decision’*

that specifies a
claimant bringing a claim under Article 805 has “the burden to prove a rule of customary
international law invoked under Article 805, through evidence of elements of customary
international law referred to in footnote 2 of Chapter Eight.” Footnote 2 provides that
customary international law refers to international custom as evidence of a general practice
accepted as law, in accordance with subparagraph 1(b) of Article 38 of the Statute of the
International Court of Justice. This decision was rendered nearly one year after this
arbitration was commenced and is therefore inapplicable pursuant to Article 28 of the VCLT
as it cannot retroactively modify Article 805. Even if it did apply, Colombia is wrong to say
that Eco Oro has not proved the content of the MST it relies upon through the elements of
customary international law, namely State practice and opinio juris. Eco Oro relied upon
the decisions of international tribunals which are an acceptable source for establishing the

existence and substance of rules of customary international law.’”°

The International Law Commission (“ILC”)’s study on the accepted sources of customary
international law found that crucial evidence of State practice includes conduct in connection
with treaties and that opinio juris may be ascertained through “public statements made on
behalf of States; [...] treaty provisions; and conduct in connection with resolutions adopted
by an international organisation or at an intergovernmental conference.”"° Additionally,
decisions of international courts and tribunals are acceptable sources for determining

customary international law. For example, as stated by Professor Reisman “[...] the same

formulas recur in many other BITs that are then interpreted by tribunals. Where there is a

convergence of practice and opinio juris among a significant number of such tribunals, it

may serve as evidence of customary international law. Hence, in the context of customary

international law in investment law, BITs and decisions of tribunals adjudicating the
disputes arising from these investment treaties have come to play a significant role in the
ongoing formation of law in this field. These two sources are particularly important [...]

because much of international investment law is developed through them — they represent

State practice and opinio juris in this area of law.”

Colombia is also incorrect to say that the customary international law MST is still rooted in
Neer?*; this standard has been overtaken such that the relevant standard is that investments
of aliens are protected from, inter alia, unfair and inequitable treatment. As explained by

Professor Weiler in the Oxford Handbook on International Investment Law:

“From the perspective of the investor, the promise of ‘fair and equitable
treatment’, or the prohibition found in some BITs against discriminatory or
arbitrary interference, also amounts to a guarantee of freedom from
arbitrariness or caprice in discretionary decision making. A customary
international law formulation of the same freedom, conferred as a right in the
treaty context, is the prohibition against abuse of authority (or abus de droit).
Professor Bin Cheng devoted an entire chapter of his renowned treatise on
the principles of international law to the manner in which the doctrine of
abuse of rights rises, as understood in international law generally, from the
general international law principle of good faith [...].”"

 

In addition, treaty practice demonstrates that the fair and equitable treatment language was
equivalent to the international minimum standard, as the connection is drawn between FET
and customary international law in a number of treaties and model BITs of Canada,
Colombia and the United States as well as the IISD Model International Agreement on
Investment for Sustainable Development. Whilst repetition of treaty language on its own
may be insufficient to give rise to a binding customary international law obligation, FET is
distinct because it is almost universally included in contemporary treaties with similar
language, model BITs and has been identified in a number of treaties as being a component

of the MST under customary international law. This leads to the conclusion that FET has

become a widely recognised standard for the treatment of foreign investors and constitutes

a part of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.

Finally, case law also supports this conclusion. The ordinary meaning of the FET standard
is a broad concept that cannot be summarised in a precise statement of legal obligation
allowing for independent and objective determination of whether it has been reached.
Many tribunals have expressed the view that there has been a substantive convergence of the
FET standard and the MST under customary international law. For example, in Waste
Management II, the tribunal concluded that “the minimum standard of treatment of fair and
equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the
claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory
and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process

leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.””°

There is therefore little material difference between MST under customary international law
and the FET standard. To the extent this is not accepted, Article 804 guarantees that

Colombia will accord Canadian investors and their investments “treatment no less

favourable” than that which it accords to the investments of any other country. In its bilateral

investment treaty with Switzerland, Colombia ensures the “fair and equitable treatment” of

investments made by Swiss investors without reference to the minimum standard

of treatment.”>!

This standard has been described by an international arbitral tribunal as requiring States:

“[T]o provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the
basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to
make the investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a
consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its
relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and
all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals
of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able
to plan its investment and comply with such regulations. [...] The foreign
investor also expects the host State to act consistently, i.e. without arbitrarily
revoking any preexisting decisions or permits issued by the State that were
relied upon by the investor to assume its commitments as well as to plan and
launch its commercial and business activities.” 7

As it is a broad concept, conduct that is “arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic or

99733

is discriminatory is in breach of this obligation and Colombia is required to follow an

approach that is: “just”, “even-handed”, “unbiased” or “legitimate.”"* Tribunals applying
FET as part of customary international law have generally converged on interpretative
criteria, including that a State must, inter alia, (i) not frustrate an investor’s legitimate
expectations; (ii) provide a stable and transparent legal and regulatory environment; and
(iii) act in good faith and not in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, disproportionate or the
like. With respect to this third limb, the principle of good faith is a central tenet to the
minimum standard of treatment and Eco Oro relies upon the same arguments as it does with
respect to Colombia’s breaches of Article 811: Colombia must not frustrate Eco Oro’s
legitimate expectations and must act in good faith incorporating the concepts of fairness,

transparency, (non)arbitrariness, clarity, (non)ambiguity and predictability.

. Additionally, Colombia is to afford Eco Oro full protection and security entailing an

obligation of “due diligence” or “vigilance” on the part of Colombia.

Colombia breached its obligations in three respects. Firstly, it breached Eco Oro’s legitimate

expectations to explore and exploit in the entirety of Concession 3452. Eco Oro had received

Colombia’s encouragement for over 20 years and its rights were legitimate as they were

premised upon explicit or implicit assurances or representations, contained in:
a. Permit 3452;

b. The 1988 Mining Code, particularly Article 1 (the Code was enacted to “encourage
investment in [the mining] industry, and promote the development of the regions
where [mining activities] are carried out’), Article 6 (“[plermits and licences
granted by means of a duly enforceable resolution, that remain in force and valid
as of the date of the entry into force of this Code” constitute acquired rights) and
Article 9 (environmental zones could not apply retroactively to previously

issued titles);
c. The 2001 Mining Code, particularly Article 46 (a stabilisation clause); and
d. Concession 3452, particularly Clause One.

As explained above, it is incorrect that Eco Oro should have been aware both that it may not
have had access to all parts of Concession 3452 for the duration of the concession or of the
difficulties it would face in successfully obtaining an environmental licence. None of the
instruments referred to by Colombia (the General Environmental Law, the Paramo
Programme and the 2007 Atlas) amounted to a restriction on mining activities in the area of
Concession 3452 and as a function of Colombia’s measures, Eco Oro was deprived of the
right to attempt to meet the applicable environmental licensing requirements during the term

of the concession which was an acquired right.

The legitimacy of its expectations is reinforced by the Colombian law doctrine of confianza
legitima which protects expectations formed by commitments or assurances given by the
Government from subsequent Government actions that undermine those expectations (as

referred to by the Attorney General in his letter to both the Ministries of Mines and

737

Environment and also to the ANM urging the delimitation process to respect existing and

acquired mining rights so as not to incur State liability.”°

These expectations were formed each time Eco Oro took a decisive step towards the

“creation, expansion, d or rec isation of the in 736 Tt was

 

reasonable for Eco Oro to rely on these assurances that purported to have a stabilising effect.
As stated by Professor Reisman and Dr. Arsanjani: “[w]here a host state which seeks foreign
investment acts intentionally, so as to create expectations in potential investors with respect

to particular treatment or comportment, the host state should [...] be bound by the

 

commitments and the investor is entitled to rely upon them in instances of decision.”

These legitimate expectations were frustrated by those Government measures described in
detail with respect to Eco Oro’s arguments above in relation to the breach of Article 811, but
in summary: (i) Resolution 2090; (ii) Judgement C-35; (iii) VSC 829; and (iv) the opinions
and decisions issued by the ANM indicating mining would be prohibited in the Restoration

Zone as well as the Preservation Zone.

The FET standard also requires Colombia to maintain a stable and transparent investment
environment in accordance with Eco Oro’s legitimate expectations and enabling Eco Oro to

plan its business and investments in an orderly fashion.

Colombia failed to provide this. As described in more detail with respect to Colombia’s
breach of Article 811, the delimitation was arbitrary, inconsistent and confusing, such that
Eco Oro has been on a regulatory roller coaster and Colombia has not provided a stable legal
and business environment. Colombia’s failures are numerous. Specific examples include
its failure to delimit the paramo ecosystems in the Santurban area as required by Law 1450
for more than four years at all times exhibiting an absolute lack of transparency, preventing

Eco Oro from understanding the legal status of its investment in the Angostura Project.

Even the Attorney General of Colombia complained of the “/egal uncertainty” caused by
this failure to map out paramo ecosystems. The delay in the delimitation was followed by
opaque and constantly changing rules with respect to Eco Oro’s ability to carry out mining

activities within the Santurban Paramo.

The principle of stability and predictability also protects against “inconsistency of action

738

between two arms of the same government vis-a-vis the same investor” ’’* which requires a

government to act “coherently and appl[y] its policies consistently.””°°

Colombia’s measures have not been applied coherently nor consistently and there has been
inconsistency between the different government bodies which has affected Eco Oro’s
capability to take any material decision with respect to its investment. These acts have been

described in detail above but comprise, inter alia:
a. The delays to releasing the delimitation coordinates;
b. the Project being designated a PIN and PINE;

c. the suspension of mining activities being lifted over the entirety of Concession 3452

after Resolution 2090 was issued;

d. the failure of CDMB to issue the detailed environmental guidelines and
environmental management plans for the Santurban Paramo, or carry out the zoning
required or issue an environmental management plan as required by Article 5 of

Resolution 2090;

e. the fact Eco Oro was unable to carry out all the provisions of Law 1753 in the
absence of the environmental guidelines required by Article 5 of Resolution 2090

being issued;

f. Judgement C-35 only striking down the grandfathering provisions in Law 1753 but

not referring to the equivalent grandfathering provisions in Resolution 2090;

g. the failure of the Constitutional Court to provide clarification of the state of the law,

notwithstanding the request from the ANM and Minister of Environment;

h. inconsistent decisions and communications from MinAmbiente and ANM with

respect to where mining activities were and were not permitted;

i. unreasonable and arbitrary rejections of Eco Oro’s requests for further suspensions
of the deadline to complete the exploration phase and apply for an environmental

licence;
j. the confusion resulting from the striking down of Resolution 2090; and

k. the final refusal to grant an extension to Eco Oro to file its PTO until such time as
the new delimitation was complete; although the time for publishing the new
delimitation was extended, Eco Oro was not given a concomitant extension by

the ANM.

Not only is a transparent and stable legal and business environment a component of the
obligation of FET, it is also a cornerstone of the FTA. The Preamble provides that the
Contracting Parties resolve to ensure a “predictable commercial framework for business
planning and investment.” Colombia cannot refer to any legal authority or other support for
its contention that “regulatory change taken specifically for the purposes of enhancing
and/or enforcing environmental laws and regulations cannot therefore, in any view, violate

the minimum standard in the absence of very specific undertakings to the contrary.”™*

Finally, Colombia has failed to act in good faith which is inherent in FET as it acted

arbitrarily, capriciously and disproportionately.”*! Arbitrariness occurs where “a measure

744

[is not] based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference.”"”

A measure also must be reasonable and thus proportionate, requiring the existence of a

rational policy against which to measure the proportionality.

Colombia breached Article 805 by enforcing Resolution 2090, which was arbitrary and
shambolic. There is no evidence of the socioeconomic studies having been undertaken, and
the transition zone is not a part of the paramo ecosystem but is a different ecosystem and
therefore should not have been included in the delimitation. Colombia delimited the
Santurban Paramo without undertaking the necessary field work, in breach of its
methodology; this is particularly egregious in the area including the Angostura Project which
was historically a mining district and where there had been significant foreign investment
from Eco Oro and others. This is particularly so given the Angostura Deposit covered only
0.09% of the total area of the delimited Santurban Paéramo. Colombia also failed to delimit
the paramo in accordance with specific criteria but just traced a line, most often near the
lower limit of the Transition Zone, but sometimes deviating to include areas which were
neither in the paramo nor in the Transition Zone. MinAmbiente accepted the IAvVH
delimitation without scrutiny and yet it has been criticised by the Constitutional Court both

78 and

in Judgement C-35, for lacking adequate scientific criteria in certain respects,
Judgement T-361, for inadequate consultation. The Court further took note of

MinAmbiente’s concession that serious errors had been made in the delimitation process.”

Implementation of Resolution 2090 was also disproportionate as the IAvH delineated a
different ecosystem to the paramo ecosystem and Eco Oro was particularly affected by this.
IAvH’s own data shows that the Angostura Deposit does not lie within a paramo ecosystem.
Only approximately 6% of the deposit lies within the actual paramo ecosystem, 65.11% lies
within the Transition Zone (which is not a part of the paramo ecosystem) and the remaining
29% is outside both the paramo ecosystem and the Transition Zone. However, the

delimitation pursuant to the 2090 Atlas neutralised 32.4% of the deposit area.

There are other less stringent measures which could have been adopted by Colombia such
as not including the Transition Zone in the area delimited, conducting field studies which
would have shown that Concession 3452 was not in a paramo ecosystem, adopting the
ECODES Report, or allowing Eco Oro to present its project and EIA to the environmental
authorities and allowing them to determine the compatibility of the Project with the requisite
environmental requirements. This could not have been undertaken invoking the
precautionary principle as that can only be invoked where there exists a specific and
scientifically proven risk of serious or irreversible harm; the mere existence of a risk being

insufficient.

Further elements of bad faith are displayed by Colombia’s significant delay in undertaking
the delimitation exercise and then withholding in bad faith the coordinates for many months
even after the exercise had been completed (as determined by the Constitutional Court in
Judgement T-361). Since Judgement C-35, the Government has failed to give any clarity to
Eco Oro as to what is permissible in the Restoration Zone nor what is the status of the
remaining part of Concession 3452 which does not overlap the Santurban Paramo.
Notwithstanding that Eco Oro was advised on two occasions that so long as the regulatory
uncertainty persisted, the Project would be unlicensable, Colombia refused to suspend Eco

Oro’s obligations pending resolution of the regulatory uncertainty.

Colombia also issued arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable regulatory decisions and orders,
specifically (as explained in more detail in respect of Eco Oro’s arguments as to Colombia’s

breach of Article 811):

a. The ANM’s refusal in Resolution VSC 906 on 22 August 2017 of Eco Oro’s 7
March 2017 request for a suspension of its obligations pending clarification

regarding the scope of its remaining rights;

b. The ANM’s rejection in Resolution VSC 343 on 16 April 2018 of Eco Oro’s appeal
against VSC 906;

309/387

728.

729,

730.

731.

746

c. The ANM’s extension for Eco Oro to file its PTO to coincide with the date when
the revised delimitation was issued but then the refusal to agree a further extension

concomitant with the extended date by which the re-delimitation was to be issued;

d. The ANM’s notification of 14 February 2019 ordering Eco Oro to submit its PTO
within 30 days, the failure to do so leading to rendering the Concession liable to

forfeiture.

e. In addition, without Eco Oro’s knowledge or consent, Colombia granted rights to a

third-party (i.e., Minesa) to tunnel through Concession 3452.

In summary, Colombia’s acts and omissions have failed to satisfy Eco Oro’s legitimate
expectations that Colombia would respect the solemn stability commitments established in
its 2001 Mining Code and apply in a consistent and non-arbitrary manner the Political
Constitution and laws of Colombia in place at the time when it made its investments.

Colombia has consequently breached Article 805 of the FTA.

(b) The Respondent’s Position

(i) Colombia Treated Eco Oro’s Investment in Accordance with the
Minimum Standard of Treatment Under Customary International Law

It is clear from the text of footnote 2 to Article 805 that both FET and FPS under this Article

do not require treatment “in addition to or beyond” the MST.

Eco Oro has firstly failed to prove the content of the standard it is relying on by reference to
State practice and opinio juris pursuant to the Commission’s Decision. The fact the
Commission’s Decision was issued after the commencement of this arbitration is irrelevant;

it merely confirms the meaning of the FTA as it existed upon entering into force.

Investment treaty tribunal decisions are not acceptable sources, at best they only reflect State
practice and opinio juris.”* This can be seen in Canada’s non-disputing party submission

in Bear Creek.”*° Eco Oro cannot rely on decisions of tribunals interpreting an autonomous

FET standard that is not qualified by customary international law in order to prove the

existence of rules of customary international law.

Legitimate expectations are not protected under MST under customary international law, as
stated by both Canada and the United States in non-disputing party submissions”*” and by
numerous commentators such as Professor Dumberry in his study of the FET standard in the
context of NAFTA.”4* Equally, there is no guaranteed right to a stable and transparent legal
and regulatory environment, indeed the MST must not be applied in any way that fetters a
State’s right to regulate; a high degree of deference must be extended to the right of a State
to regulate matters within its boundaries.” Finally, there is no general and consistent State
practice and opinio juris establishing an obligation of transparency under the MST. All the
cases cited by Eco Oro relate to tribunals applying the autonomous FET standard, not the
MST under customary international law, and the Tribunal should disregard those cases not

decided on the MST standard.

For there to be a compensable breach of MST, there must be conduct which is “arbitrary

 

beyond a merely i i or q ionabl lication of administrative or legal policy
or procedure so as to constitute an unexpected and shocking repudiation of a policy’s very

purpose and goals, or to otherwise grossly subvert a domestic law or policy for an ulterior

motive; or involve[s] an utter lack of due process so as to offend judicial propriety.”"°

Were the Tribunal to determine, however, that a MST did encompass obligations of
legitimate expectations, stable and transparent legal and regulatory environment, Eco Oro

has failed to meet the very high bar it would need to succeed in its claim. Colombia does

not say that Neer still defines the standard for Eco Oro to meet but it does remain relevant to
the interpretation of the MST FET standard and numerous tribunals subsequently have

confirmed that the bar is high.”*!

As already detailed above with respect to Eco Oro’s claim for breach of Article 811,
Colombia did not provide any specific or unambiguous assurances to Eco Oro that it would
be permitted to mine in the paramo area of Concession 3452. As Eco Oro did not have any

legitimate expectations, none could be frustrated.

Colombia’s policy of protecting the paramo was consistent; there was no regulatory turmoil.
In particular, even if there was a delay in publishing the 2090 delimitation, it did not cause
legal uncertainty for Eco Oro as the MinAmbiente was not required to issue its delineation
within any specific timeframe and merely gave advance notice to the mining companies as
a matter of courtesy. It published the delineation when it was ready to do so and Eco Oro
has not challenged this and in any event it was 99% identical to the 2007 Atlas. The delay
in the CDMB publishing the guidelines is also irrelevant as Eco Oro has no grandfathered
rights so would have been unable in any event to prepare a PTO for approval. Equally, all

the measures relating to the grandfathering provisions are irrelevant to Eco Oro.

MinAmbiente and ANM’s communications and decisions in relation to the treatment of the
Restoration Area were neither inconsistent nor confusing as Eco Oro was never informed it

would be able to mine in the Restoration Zone.

The ANM always responded to Eco Oro in a prompt and responsible manner and was
justified in denying Eco Oro’s request for an indefinite suspension pending the re-delineation

of the Santurban Paramo.

Eco Oro has adduced no credible evidence to support its contentions and it is clear that all
arms of the government were working together towards one paramount goal, protecting the

paramo.

The FPS standard does not include legal protection and security as stated in the
Commission’s Decision and in any event this is clear as has been endorsed by numerous
tribunals such as Crystallex, Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA and Vivendi
Universal SA v. The Argentine Republic and Gold Reserve Inc v. Bolivarian Republic of

Venezuela.

Finally, Colombia did not act arbitrarily, capriciously or disproportionately. The Resolution
2090 delimitation was not shambolic, nor disproportionate and ANM’s decisions were all

fully and properly justified.

In any event, given the substantial deference which should be given to Colombia’s right to
balance important policy decisions with those of private parties, to accept Eco Oro’s claims
would be for the Tribunal to second-guess Colombia’s decision-making. It is not appropriate
for a host State to be required to elevate unconditionally the interests of a foreign investor
above all other considerations, where there is no evidence of irrationality or bad faith.”
Clearly, Colombia had the right not to elevate unconditionally the interests of Eco Oro above

the well-being of the paramo ecosystem.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Colombia’s obligation under Article 805 is to ensure treatment that meets the level of that
required by the customary international law MST. The Tribunal must therefore ascertain

what that level comprises and then apply it to the facts.

As a preliminary point, the Tribunal does not accept that the meaning of MST under

customary international law must remain static. The meaning must be permitted to evolve
as indeed international customary law itself evolves;’>? it should be understood today to

include today’s notions of what comprises minimum standards of treatment under customary

(21 January 2016) (Exhibit RL-155), para. 573.

See, e.g., Merrill, Award (31 March 2010) (Exhibit CL-176), para. 193: “customary international law has not
been frozen in time and that it continues to evolve in accordance with the realities of the international
community. No legal system could endure in stagnation.”

international law. Colombia correctly accepts that the Tribunal is not rigidly bound by the
standard set out in Neer’ and it is the Tribunal’s view that the standard today is broader

than that defined in the Neer case.”*°

The Tribunal also accepts that Colombia is under no obligation to exceed this standard and,
as it is not considering an autonomous treaty standard of FET but a “minimum” standard,
the Tribunal further accepts the obligation should not be interpreted expansively.
The Tribunal does not, however, accept that footnote 2 to Article 805 limits it as to what
sources the Tribunal may refer to as evidence in analysing the meaning of MST under
customary international law; the concept has been considered by several tribunals and where
the Tribunal finds it to be of assistance in ascertaining what is the current meaning of MST
under customary international law, it considers those decisions which it finds to be relevant.
As stated by the tribunal in Merrill’ “State practice and opinio juris will be the guiding

beacons of this evolution.”

In construing Article 805, the Tribunal is again guided by Article 31 of the VCLT,”*” such
that it is necessary to “interprer[] [it] in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning

to be given to the terms of the [FTA] in their context and in light of its object and purpose”.

The ordinary meaning of ‘fair’ and ‘equitable’ is “just” “even-hande unbiased” and
“legitimate.”"* Thus, actions that infringe a sense of fairness, equity and reasonableness

will fall afoul of Article 805.

The Preamble to the FTA provides that its purpose is, inter alia, to “ensure a predictable
commercial framework for business planning and investment” and “enhance and enforce
environmental laws and regulations, and to strengthen cooperation on environmental
matters.” Applying the ordinary meaning of Article 805 to the object and purpose of the
FTA (as relevant to Eco Oro’s claim), Eco Oro was entitled to expect that Colombia would
treat its investment in an even-handed and just manner to ensure a predictable business
environment and foster the promotion of foreign investment but that, in doing so, it would
ensure the enhancement and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, such that

neither investment protection nor environmental protection takes precedence.

This does not mean that Colombia was under an obligation to guarantee that the domestic
regulatory environment would remain stable. The Tribunal has found that Concession 3452
did not contain a stability clause and it accepts that a State cannot be rigidly bound to those
rules and regulations in force at the time the investment is made. Indeed, as noted by the

tribunal in Mobil Investments:

“This applicable standard does not require a State to maintain a stable legal
and business environment for investments, if this is intended to suggest that
the rules governing an investment are not permitted to change, whether to a
significant or modest extent. Article 1105 may protect an investor from
changes that give rise to an unstable legal and business environment, but only
if those changes may be characterized as arbitrary or grossly unfair or
discriminatory, or otherwise inconsistent with the customary international
law standard. In a complex international and domestic environment, there is
nothing in Article 1105 to prevent a public authority from changing the
regulatory environment to take account of new policies and needs, even if
some of those changes may have far-reaching consequences and effects, and
even if they impose significant additional burdens on an investor. Article
1105 is not, and was never intended to amount to, a guarantee against
regulatory change, or to reflect a requirement that an investor is entitled to
expect no material changes to the regulatory framework within which an
investment is made. Governments change, policies changes and rules
change. These are facts of life with which investors and all legal and natural
persons have to live with. What the foreign investor is entitled to under
Article 1105 is that any changes are consistent with the requirements of
customary international law on fair and equitable treatment. Those
standards are set at, as we have noted above, at a level which protects against
egregious behaviour.”7°°

 

750. Whilst Mobil Investments was an arbitration under NAFTA, the Tribunal agrees with the

751.

759

principle that Article 805 cannot act as a restraint upon Colombia’s legitimate ability to

regulate matters within its borders.

The Tribunal further understands it is inevitable that, in exercising its police powers, a State
will find itself at times having to make difficult and potentially controversial choices,
particularly when considering issues of environmental protection and public health.

The Tribunal therefore agrees with the tribunal’s statement in Cargill that “an actionable

finding of arbitrariness must not be based simply on a tribunal’s determination that a

domestic agency or legislature incorrectly weighed the various factors, made legitimate

compromises between disputing constituencies, or applied social or economic reasoning in

Mobil, Decision on Liability and Principles of Quantum (22 May 2012) (Exhibit CL-179), para. 153. See also
Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania, ICSD Case No. ARB/05/8, Award (11 September 2007)
(Exhibit RL-75), para. 332: “/t is each State’s undeniable right and privilege to exercise its sovereign
legislative power. A State has the right to enact, modify or cancel a law at its own discretion. Save for the
existence of an agreement, in the form of a stabilisation clause or otherwise, there is nothing objectionable
about the amendment brought to the regulatory framework existing at the time an investor made its investment.
As a matter of fact, any businessman or investor knows that laws will evolve over time. What is prohibited
however is for a State to act unfairly, unreasonably or inequitably in the exercise of its legislative power.”

a manner that the tribunal criticises.” In determining whether Colombia’s actions were
in breach of Article 805, the Tribunal therefore does not seek either to second-guess
Colombia’s decision-making nor to judge the calibre of the administration of Colombia’s

Hl

governmental programmes.”°! Equally, deference to the State’s powers cannot require

the Tribunal to condone actions that would otherwise comprise a breach of Article 805.

Eco Oro contends that good faith and the prohibition of arbitrariness are basic obligations of
international law and the Tribunal is satisfied that FET encompassing concepts of non-
arbitrariness, transparency and fairness are recognised elements of customary international
law within the confines of reasonableness. Article 805 encapsulates the bona fide obligation
upon a State and, as such, constitutes a guarantee to investors that whilst regulatory changes
may be made, any such changes will be consistent with the requirements of FET under
customary international law and not made in an arbitrary or otherwise egregious fashion.
The regulatory changes effected by Colombia will therefore amount to a breach of
Article 805 if Colombia has acted in a way which is “arbitrary or grossly unfair or
discriminatory, or otherwise inconsistent with the customary international law standard”"
always bearing in mind how these terms are understood in the context of customary

international law.

A similar approach has been followed by other tribunals. For example, the tribunal in S.D.
Myers’® noted that the starting point for analysis is that such a violation occurs “only when

it is shown that an investor has been treated in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the

Cargill, Award (18 September 2009) [Redacted] (Exhibit RL-81), para. 292.
See, e.g., Philip Morris, Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of Gary Born (8 July 2016) (Exhibit RL-102),
para. 137: “Jt is important to recognize that the fair and equitable treatment standard, and the protection
against arbitrary measures, does not empower this, or any other, tribunal to second-guess legislative or
regulatory judgments. On the contrary, it is well-settled that the judgments of national regulatory and
legislative authorities are entitled, under the fair and equitable treatment guarantee, to a substantial measure
of deference.”; TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC v. Republic of Guatemala, 1CSID Case No. ARB/10/17,
Award (19 December 2013) (Exhibit CL-184), para. 493: “although the role of an international tribunal is
not to second-guess or to review decisions that have been made genuinely and in good faith by a sovereign in
the normal exercise of its powers, it is up to an international arbitral tribunal to sanction decisions that amount
to an abuse of power, are arbitrary, or are taken in manifest disregard of the applicable legal rules and in
breach of due process in regulatory matters.”

treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective.
That determination must be made in the light of the high measure of deference that
international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters
within their own borders.” Although a case determined under NAFTA regarding a breach
of Article 1105, this supports the proposition that there is a high threshold for finding a
violation of the MST.

Reviewing past decisions, concepts such as transparency, stability and the protection of the
investor’s legitimate expectations play a central role in defining the FET standard, as does
procedural or judicial propriety and due process and fairness, refraining from taking arbitrary
or discriminatory measures, or from frustrating the investor’s reasonable expectations with
respect to the legal framework affecting the investment. Unjust or idiosyncratic actions,”
a wilful neglect of duty, an insufficiency of action falling far below international standards,
or even subjective bad faith have all been found to be in breach of FET. 7 A State may

treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith.’°°

Having reviewed the relevant decisions, whilst malicious intention, wilful neglect of duty or

bad faith are not requisite elements of MST under customary international law, there must

be some aggravating factor such that the acts identified comprise more than a minor
derogation from that which is deemed to be internationally acceptable. The conduct in
question must engender a sense of outrage or shock, amount to gross unfairness or manifest

767 or there must have been a lack of due

arbitrariness falling below acceptable standards,
process which has led to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety.”° The
treatment complained of must therefore be unacceptable from an international perspective
whilst set against the high measure of deference that international law extends to States to

regulate matters within their own borders.

Eco Oro asserts that Colombia acted in an arbitrary manner. Tribunals have wrestled with

the meaning of ‘arbitrary’ and ‘arbitrariness.’

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ‘arbitrary’ means “[d]ependent on will or
pleasure” or “[b]ased on mere opinion or preference as opposed to the real nature of things,
capricious, unpredictable, inconsistent.”" A similar definition is found in Black’s Law
Dictionary which defines the word ‘arbitrary’ as “[d]epending on individual discretion; of,
relating to, or involving a determination made without consideration of or regard for facts,

circumstances, fixed rules or procedures” and ‘arbitrary’ (of a judicial decision) is defined

as “founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact.”7”°

The starting point for this analysis is the decision of the International Court of Justice in

Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (‘ELST’):

“Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as
something opposed to the rule of law. This idea was expressed by the court in
the Asylum case, when it spoke of ‘arbitrary action’ being ‘substituted for the
rule of law’ [...]. It is a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which
shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.”™

In considering what is meant by a sense of juridical propriety, the Tribunal again turns to the
definitions contained in the Oxford English Dictionary and Black’s Law Dictionary. There
is no definition of ‘juridical impropriety’ in Black’s Law Dictionary. The Oxford English
Dictionary defines ‘impropriety’ as “the quality of being improper” such that there is a “want
of accordance with the nature of the thing, or with reason or rule, incorrectness,
erroneousness, inaccuracy” or “want of accordance with the purpose in view;
unsuitableness, unfitness, inappropriateness.” Turning to Black’s Law Dictionary,

impropriety is “behaviour that is inappropriate or unacceptable under the circumstances.”

Of further guidance are the indicia of arbitrary measures which were formulated by Professor
Christoph Schreuer when acting as an expert in EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania’ and

which have been cited with approval, most recently’? by the tribunals in Teinver v.

Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America y. Italy), 1989 1.C.J. 15, 76 (Judgment of
20 July 1989) (Exhibits CL-153 / RL-50), para. 128. See also Asylum Case (Colombia v. Peru), [1950]
ICJ Reports 266 (Judgment of 20 November 1950) (Exhibit RL-139), para. 284, cited to in ELSI: “In principle,
therefore, asylum cannot be opposed to the operation of justice. An exception to this rule can occur only if, in
the guise of justice, arbitrary action is substituted for the rule of law. Such would be the case if the
administration of justice were corrupted by measures clearly prompted by political aims. Asylum protects the
political offender against any measures of a manifestly extra-legal character which a government might take
or attempt to take against its political opponents. The word "safety", which in Article 2, paragraph 2,
determines the specific effect of asylum granted to political offenders, means that the refugee is protected
against arbitrary action by the government, and that he enjoys the benefits of the law”.

are:

a. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent

legitimate purpose;

b. a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice, or

personal preference;

c. a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the

decision-maker; and
d. ameasure taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.

In assessing whether there has been a breach of Article 805, it is necessary to consider all
the facts and circumstances. As determined in Gold Reserve v. Venezuela, “even if a measure

or conduct by the State, taken in isolation, does not rise to the level of a breach of the FET,

such a breach may result from a series of circumstances or a combination of measures.” 1”

To establish a violation of Article 805, Eco Oro must therefore firstly show that Colombia

either (i) breached Eco Oro’s legitimate expectations as such expectations were, or should

have been, informed by the exercise of due diligence; or (ii) failed to provide at all times a
stable and transparent investment environment; or (iii) did not act in good faith as
required by international law. Secondly, if such a breach is found, it must be determined

whether Colombia’s actions are unacceptable from an international law perspective.
The Tribunal now turns to apply this standard to the facts.

(a) Legitimate Expectations

The Tribunal has already found that Colombia did not make any specific representations to
Eco Oro that it would not bring in a mining exclusion ban in any part of Concession 3452
with retrospective effect. Did Eco Oro have other legitimate expectations that were
frustrated by Colombia? Eco Oro says that Colombia created its legitimate expectations and
induced its investment, referring to the mining permits it obtained which were consolidated
into Concession 3452, the Concession itself, and the legislation pursuant to which the

permits and Concession 3452 were issued.

In the context of considering whether Colombia is in breach of Article 811, the Tribunal
determined by a majority that Eco Oro did not have any investment-backed legitimate
expectations on the basis that the statements made in Permit 3452 and the 1988 Mining Code
did not constitute legitimate representations on which Eco Oro could rely in making its
investment. The Tribunal has also determined by a majority that Article 46 of the 2001
Mining Code is not a stabilisation clause and, had Eco Oro undertaken appropriate due
diligence, it would have been advised that Colombia could retrospectively impose a mining

ban on all or part of Concession 3452 to protect a paramo ecosystem.

However, Eco Oro says Colombia made other representations. It granted Concession 3452
to Eco Oro in full knowledge that a significant part of the concession area overlapped the
Santurban Paramo (there was a general awareness of the existence of paramo in the area

where Concession 3452 was granted since 18517’), that mining exploitation activities were

787

being conducted in the Santurban Paramo area (and indeed had been for centuries’”’) and of
the likely adverse effect of mining on the paramo which it had accepted responsibility to
protect pursuant to Law 373 of 1997,”*° the General Environmental Law,’*! Articles 8, 58,
79 and 80 of the Political Constitution,’** as well as the environment-related international
conventions it had signed up to such as the Ramsar Convention’*? and the Biodiversity
Convention.’** Indeed the Constitutional Court observed in Judgement T-411/927** that
Colombia had a “[...] duty to safeguard the environment due to a fundamental constitutional
right.” Thus, at the time Concession 3452 was granted to Eco Oro in 2007, Colombia knew
both that the Santurbén Paramo existed and that it had an obligation to protect it. Colombia
could have chosen not to grant a mining concession over this area. Colombia had the power
to delimit the paramo and, pursuant to section 16 of Law 373 of 1997, it was obliged to

99786

acquire paramo areas such as the Santurban Paramo “as a priority”'°° as well as to initiate a

recovery, protection and conservation process to ensure protection of the paramo. However,
Colombia did not take the necessary action it was legally required to take to protect the
Santurban Paéramo; instead, it granted a mining concession over the area in question. Indeed,
notwithstanding Colombia’s obligation to protect paramo ecosystems, the Tribunal notes
there was a considerable increase in the granting of mining titles in paramo ecosystems
between 1990 and 2009 with an approximate consequential 555% increase in investments in

the mining sector.’*”

Indeed, even after the grant of Concession 3452, notwithstanding the subsequent laws,

resolutions and court decisions (as described above) mandating the final delimitation of the

See Constitutional Court Judgment No. T-361 (30 May 2017) (Exhibit C-244), e.g., pp. 214-215, where the
Constitutional Court acknowledges that gold mining “has always been connected to [the great Department of
Santander] and its populations”.

paramo, no such delimitation was undertaken, yet Eco Oro continued to receive
encouragement from Colombia with respect to Concession 3452. Examples include
statements to the effect that Colombia supported the Project and wanted to ensure successful
exploitation as the Angostura Project was a ‘VIP’ project, on one occasion from President
Santos and, on other occasions, from various ministers and other government officials.
Further, the repeated nominations of Concession 3452 as a PIN/PINE all led to Eco Oro’s
understanding that the Angostura Project was supported by Colombia. Given these
circumstances, Eco Oro’s belief that the Santurban Paramo did not overlap the Angostura
Deposit, as concluded by the ECODES report, is therefore reasonable and gave rise to a

legitimate expectation that the Angostura Project was supported by Colombia.

Could reliance on these representations have been displaced by due diligence? Whilst there
is no evidence on the record of the due diligence actually undertaken by Eco Oro, it cannot
be disputed that proper due diligence would have notified Eco Oro of the presence of paramo
within the area of the Concession. Equally, due diligence would have alerted Eco Oro to the
fact that paramo presence had been known to Colombia since 18517°* and Eco Oro would
also have been alerted to the fact that Colombia had had the duty to protect paramo
ecosystems since Law 373 of 1997 but had not taken any action. Eco Oro should also have
been aware that given the terms of Constitutional Court Judgment C-293 of 2002, its rights
pursuant to Concession 3452 were subject to the overriding interests of the State to protect
the environment. Against this, however, Eco Oro should also have been aware of Article 58
of the Political Constitution, the Colombian law principle of ‘confianza legitima’ (legitimate
expectation) and Colombian law relating to acquired rights (such as Eco Oro’s right to
exploitation) which, as confirmed by the Consejo de Estado in its Advisory Opinion 2233,
ensures that in the event of a retroactive application of the law leading to loss of an acquired
right, compensation must be paid, such compensation including compensation for actual

damages suffered as well as certain future losses and the loss of a chance.
In weighing up the various factors, it is also relevant to note that Colombia encouraged

foreign miners into the country and held up Eco Oro as an example of a successful investor.

These statements were clearly made to encourage foreign investment, although again basic
due diligence would have alerted any potential investor of the need to clarify whether the
proposed concession overlapped any suspected paramo ecosystem and of the potential risk
of a mining exclusion ban being imposed. Indeed, a disclaimer was included in the
December 2015 brochure published by the ANM,”® alerting investors to the risk that the
applicable rules could be amended at any time and that prospective investors should verify
whether the proposed title was or was not within the prohibited areas for mining and/or in

an environmental exclusion zone.

In considering Eco Oro’s legitimate expectations, regard must also be had to the object and
purpose of the FTA: Colombia was obliged to ensure a predictable business environment.
Indeed, predictability is essential in enabling an investor properly to plan its business strategy
and ensure its compliance with the rules and regulations which will govern its business. Eco

Oro was entitled to an expectation that “its business may be conducted in a normal

framework free of interference from Government regulations which are not underpinned by

2790

appropriate policy objectives whilst recognising that Colombia could not be rigidly

bound to those rules and regulations in force at the time the investment was made.

Equally, Eco Oro was not entitled to any guarantee of success: mining is inherently uncertain
and given the nature and location of the project it must have been foreseeable to Eco Oro
that it would inevitably face significant challenges in seeking successfully to explore and
then exploit the concession area, but such anticipated challenges would have related to the

nature of the project itself and not to Colombia’s actions.

At the heart of the matter is Colombia’s failure to comply with its legal obligations to delimit
the Santurbaén Paramo pursuant to the provisions of Colombian law. Did Colombia ensure
that the regulatory changes it both instituted and, of equal relevance, failed to institute with
respect to the designation of the Santurban Paramo were consistent with its treaty obligations
to ensure a predictable business environment and with the requirements of customary

international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including the obligation to

provide fair and equitable treatment, and not made in an arbitrary or otherwise egregious

fashion?

Since at least 1991, Colombia has been subject to a legal duty to conserve areas of special
ecological significance”! as evidenced by its signatory of the Biodiversity Convention in
1992 and the passing of the General Environmental Law. Colombia has thus committed
itself to the protection of the paramo and its actions were, it submits, undertaken pursuant to
its obligation to protect the paramo. The FTA also emphasises this environmental obligation.
Any analysis of whether Colombia’s actions, viewed as a whole, were the result of reasoned
judgement and were related to and reasonably proportionate to Colombia’s articulated
objectives or were instead arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic must be

undertaken in this context.

The existence of the Santurban Paramo had been known since 1851 and although Colombia
had been under an obligation to delimit and acquire all paramos since the passing of Law
373 in 1997, at the time the Concession was granted in 2007, the Santurban Paramo had not
been delimited. Further, whilst Colombia was aware that the Santurban Paramo overlapped
at least a part of Concession 3452, it took no steps to issue a mining exclusion zone over this
area at the time the Concession was granted. At the time Eco Oro made its investment,
Colombia had therefore failed to comply with its constitutional obligations to protect

the paramo.

Since Concession 3452 was granted and to this day, no lawfully compliant final delimitation
of the Santurbén Paramo has been effected, such that the legal status of the paramo remains
in a state of paralysed confusion. Colombia was and is well aware of the temporary nature
of the delimitation; for example, the ANM concluded in Resolution VSC 4 (issued on
12 September 2012)’ that the 2007 Atlas delimitation was only temporary and the
suspension of the mining activities in those areas identified as paramo would be maintained
“until the [MinAmbiente] issues the final delimitation to a scale of 1:25,000.”

This recognition that the delimitation is temporary in nature can also be seen from the

Political Constitution of Colombia (1991) (Exhibit C-65), Art. 79.

Attorney General’s Video Tweet on 12 February 2018 when he stated that Colombia was
“[...] working towards the paramo’s delimitation before the end of the current

administration.”

It is also clear that some of Colombia’s actions appear to facilitate or support mining in areas
of paramo; for example, Decree 2820 (5 August 2010) provides, inter alia, that
environmental licences could be issued for mining exploitation activities in special
ecosystems, including paramo areas (Article 10). Again, whilst Colombia says that ANM’s
designation of Concession 3452 as a PINE on 22 February 2011 (and again on 19 June 2013)
was due to the potential environmental implications of the Project, the express wording of
the designation provides that it is given not only due to the relevant project’s “environmental

impact”, but also on the basis, inter alia, of its “social importance” and “its important
reserves destined for international markets.””> Indeed, of the seven criteria listed (a project
must meet at least one to be designated a PINE) only one relates to the environmental impact
of the project whilst the remaining six relate to economic and socio-economic reasons (the
declaratory resolution does not state the reasons for which the PINE designation was
awarded to Concession 3452). It is unclear whether the Project was designated a PINE due

to its economic importance to Colombia or for reasons of environmental sensitivity.

The failure to carry out a delimitation at 1:25,000 also means that the inevitable errors in
both the 2007 Atlas and the 2090 Atlas remain uncorrected such that the Angostura Deposit
cannot be said with any certainty to be within the Santurban Paramo. Ms. Baptiste explained
that the 2007 Atlas was not a delimitation and was so large scale and imprecise that the area
of Concession 3452 was “invisible.””* It is inevitable that the 2007 Atlas would have given
rise to significant confusion as to what mining activity would be permitted and where it
would be permitted within the concession area. Again, the ANM noted in Resolution
VSC No. 4 that “it cannot be said with complete certainty, due to the absence of technical

parameters, that [the concession area] is located within the paramo”.”°

It is also uncontroversial that the lengthy and continuing delay in publishing a final
delimitation of the Santurban Paramo led to considerable uncertainty for Eco Oro and indeed
for the mining industry more generally, as to what mining operations would and would not
be permissible in potentially affected areas. This can be seen, for example, from a letter
dated 9 September 2013 written by the then Colombian Attorney General, Alejandro
Ordéfiez Maldonado, to the Minister of Mines, the Minister of the Environment and the

President of the ANM.7%

The Attorney General noted that pursuant to Law 1450 the mining sector was one of the
comerstones for the financing of the Development Plan and that “[t]he many reforms
required by the State to make the mining industry the ‘locomotive’ contributing to
Colombian prosperity were based on this assumption.” He further noted that there was a
responsibility under the Constitution to develop mining in a responsible manner, however,
he then referred to the failure of the Environment Ministry to delimit the paramos (and also
its failure to delimit the reserve forests which failure continued even 54 years after the
enactment of the relevant law) and stated that this delay had “hindered not only the execution
of mining activities in these areas but also the implementation of social measures by the

State [...].” He then explained that these delays and consequential issues:

“created an uncertain legal environment that resulted in the discussion
becoming ideological, which made it seem in some respects that the

of an envi lly responsible mining industry is
incompatible with the conservation of the environment, which criminalizes
the activity, exaggerating its effects and creating suspicions about any

decision taken by the mining or environmental authorities.””"
The Attorney General concluded by stating as follows:

“In short, the Ministries and ANM are hereby compelled to take appropriate
action in order to:

1. Coordinate efforts to comply with their obligations as established by law
and the Constitution;

2. Whenever possible and as mandated by the Political Constitution, settle
existing queries given that there are mining areas that had been granted
to black and native communities in some of the areas intended to be
regulated;

3. Avoid ideologization of the debate and make decisions based on
comprehensive supporting studies;
4. Regularly share any progress made in the zoning and delimitation

process for the sake of transparency;

5. Recognize any consolidated situations and vested rights to prevent the
filing of legal claims against the Colombian state;

6. The National Mining Agency is required to proceed with caution to
refrain from rejecting proposals or terminating agreements if there are
conditions — such as the decisions made by the Ministry of the
Environment and Sustainable Development — that may threaten citizens
and companies that, relying on the principle of confianza legitima, have
approached the State to propose or develop mining concessions.”"*

781. It can be seen that Colombia’s inconsistent approach continued, however. Whilst Minister

798,

Sarmiento announced on 30 November 2013 that the delimitation of the Santurban Paramo
had been completed, she did not publish the coordinates. Instead, although she had
announced that the coordinates had been agreed, she then initiated consultations with
affected communities, an action which contributed to the Constitutional Court’s finding of
bad faith on the part of the Environment Ministry. Even after these consultations had
concluded, the coordinates were still not released. On 30 March 2014, Minister Sarmiento
announced she would be publishing the coordinates to put an end to the uncertainty, but
although a map was published, it did not contain coordinates. Instead, Minister Sarmiento
publicly stated that the delimited paramo would be four times bigger than Santurban Park
and that there was an overlap between Concession 3452 and the delimited paramo. Whilst
Eco Oro says it was advised that the official coordinates would be released “in the coming
days” this still did not transpire. Minister Sarmiento then announced the coordinates would
be published by 1 August 2014 but again this did not happen and shortly thereafter Minister
Sarmiento was replaced as Minister of Environment by Mr. Gabriel Vallejo, the fifth

environment Minister in less than four years.

The uncertainty and confusion as to what the parameters of the Santurban Paramo should be
can also be seen from the following. Whilst the [AvH was progressing with the delimitation
of the Santurban Paramo, it submitted a formal opinion to the CDMB as a part of the process
by which the CDMB created the Santurban Park on 16 January 2013. Eco Oro’s submission
during this arbitration to the effect that this Park comprised 11,700 hectares and only
overlapped with a small fraction of the Angostura Deposit and would not have impeded its
development was not contested. Article Two of CDMB’s Decision declaring this Regional
National Park, noted that the preservation purposes for which the Park was declared included
the preservation of the “ecosystems of the paramo, sub paramo and Andean forest” and to
“guarantee the connectivity of the paramo ecosystems and the High Andean forests of the
Santurban ecoregion, which extend up to the department of Norte de Santander.””?
Article Four expressly provided that no mining exploration or exploitation activities could
be authorised in the Santurban Park. The Tribunal notes that Ms. Baptiste wrote to the
Mayors of each of the affected regions advising that whilst the delimitation of the paramo
and the delimitation of a Regional Park are different processes from a legal and technical
standpoint, she was “certain that the lines of both figures will be similar because they involve
a paramo ecosystem [...].”*°° It is therefore not only inconsistent but also no explanation has
been given why, when the coordinates were released as the 2090 Atlas, the Santurban
Paramo at 98,950 hectares was approximately eight times bigger than the Santurban Park
resulting in approximately 50.7% of Concession 3452 laying within the preservation area,
3.9% within the restoration area, 32% of the surface area of the Angostura Deposit

overlapping with the preservation area and 28% located beneath it.

The 2090 Atlas also did not satisfy the requirements of the 2001 Mining Code and therefore
did not create a permanent mining exclusion zone as it was not a delimitation for the purposes
of the 2001 Mining Code. Whilst it must have been clear to Eco Oro (and to the mining
community and local population) that when the 2001 Mining Code compliant delimitation
was finally undertaken, it was likely that it would be no smaller in overall size than the 2090

Atlas, given (i) that the Angostura Deposit only comprised 0.1% of the overall delimited

area;*°! (jj) Colombia accepted there was a 5-13.9% margin of error*” in determining where
the boundary should lie and the margin of error could be as much as 150 meters in altitude
in certain areas, because the “quality of the information has limitations”; and (iii) there
were clear errors in the 2090 Atlas boundaries with towns included within the boundaries,
Eco Oro cannot have been expected to assume with any certainty that the Angostura Deposit
would be determined to be within a mining exclusion zone. This clearly would have given
rise to uncertainty as to in which parts of Concession 3452 Eco Oro could undertake mining

activities.

. This confusion as to whether the Angostura Deposit would or would not fall within the

delimited area can only have been compounded by subsequent acts of the government and
its officials. Firstly, the Minister of Mines gave Eco Oro a pledge of full support to assist it
in advancing the Angostura Project.8°* The Tribunal notes no evidence was adduced by

Colombia to dispute this and Mr. Aldana was not cross-examined on this point.

Secondly, although a further two-year extension was granted for the exploration phase
limited to that area of Concession 3452 which did not overlap the paramo (Resolution VSC
727 dated on 6 August 2014),*°> only 5 months later, pursuant to Resolution VSC 3 (dated
6 January 2015),°°° the ANM lifted the suspension on mining activities in the totality of
Concession 3452, basing its decision on the following conclusion reached by the “Office of
the Vice-President of Mining Supervision, Control and Safety (Technical Opinion No. VSC-
088 of November 22, 2013)”:

3.1. After review of the technical considerations submitted by the company
holding title with respect to the requested stay of exploration activities, it is
hereby deemed technically feasible to grant such request because the
arguments raised by ECO ORO are found to be reasonable. Indeed, to
conduct hydrogeological and geotechnical studies, information should be
gathered both in unrestricted and in restricted areas, for the construction of
the hydrogeological model is highly relevant to this project, due to the
envir Li it has, idering the location of the contract
area having an “impact on the paramo, which relates to the aquifer
recharging zone and its location on the La Baja Creek basin, a tributary of
the Surata river. The Geotechnical Model is based on the Geological and
Structural and the Hydrogeological Models, and similarly require a
comprehensive evaluation of the rock massif that is part of both the
restricted and unrestricted areas.

 

A pending water concession application, and the difficulty caused by the lack
thereof for the development of exploration activities, constitutes an additional
argument in support of the foregoing, given that the alternatives ECO ORO
considered are economically unfeasible, a situation which negatively impacts
on the execution of the exploration program.”*"” [Tribunal’s emphasis]

786. Thirdly, Concession 3452 was again designated a PINE and in March 2015 the then Minister
of Mines, Mr. Tomas Gonzalez stated publicly in March 2015 at the Prospectors and

Developers Association of Canada (“PDAC”) Annual Convention that:

“[PINEs such as Eco Oro] will receive special support from the government
so that they can move forward as fast as possible. Under the new system, the
responsible ministers meet every week and look at the projects with that
designation, and see how each one is progressing. The meetings include the
ministers of Mines and Energy, Environment, Defence, Labour and the
Interior. We sit around the table and look at what issues face each project,
and then assign tasks to the various ministers. In the following meeting, we
then evaluate each task, and see how the project has progressed. [...]
We need to make sure these projects happen, because we need royalties for
development.”*°*

787. This statement is against a backdrop of Colombia’s efforts to attract foreign mining

investment. In the previous annual PDAC Conference, in early 2012, the Minister of Mines

had referred to “a transition to a new era in which mining and energy are going to lead

economic growth for the coming decades.”*”

Fourthly, the new four-year national development plan, Law 1753 of 2015, declared that the
CIIPE may confer PINE status upon projects regarded as being of social interest and serving
a public purpose and that PINES would be subject to licensing and administrative processes

before national rather than regional authorities.*!”

Finally, on 8 February 2016, Eco Oro received support for Concession 3452 from President
Santos who explained Eco Oro should apply for its environmental licence as soon as possible
to enable Colombia to “showcase” the Angostura Project as a post-paramo delimitation

success story.*! !

It cannot be said that the purpose of these actions of Colombia was in support of its stated
aim to protect the paramo; it is clear they were supporting and facilitating the continuation
of the Angostura Project. Had protection of the paramo been Colombia’s aim, it would have
ensured delimitation of the Santurban Paramo was completed reasonably promptly and in
a manner compliant with the 2001 Mining Code. It is not unreasonable that on the basis of
the above, Eco Oro believed that Colombia was supportive of the project and that
the regulatory framework would enable it to proceed to explore and exploit the

Angostura deposit.

Given this and given what then happened as described below, the Tribunal finds Eco Oro’s

description of being on a regulatory roller-coaster to be apt.

The same day that President Santos expressed his support, the Constitutional Court issued a
press release announcing it had reached a decision on the challenge to Law 1753, striking
down as unconstitutional certain provisions, including Article 173(2) of Law 1753 such that
MinAmbiente could only deviate from the [AvH’s mapping insofar as it could scientifically

demonstrate that its decision would result in a higher degree of protection of the paramo

(Judgment C-35). It is clear that this press release exacerbated the already present confusion
amongst both the mining and environmental authorities and provided no clarity as to whether
or not mining activities could be carried out in Concession 3452. The position was not

assisted as the actual judgment was not released for several months after the press release.

The extent of this confusion can be seen from the statement of the then Minister of Mines,
German Arce Zapata in his speech to the third National Mining Congress that “we have been
left in a very serious situation: there are many norms and we do not know what the rule is.

We fill legal loopholes with decrees. [...] The Court is breaking a golden rule by legislating.

812

The Court is legislating and laws are made by Congress. In its request to the

Constitutional Court for clarification (which request was denied), the ANM noted that:

“The Constitutional Court itself understands that its decision may be
controversial and decides in favor of the protection of paramos given the
ecosystem fragility that makes them extremely vulnerable to human
intervention and mining or hydrocarbon activities.

Nonetheless, the Constitutional Court admits there is a wide array of mining
methods, and sustains that proper environmental monitoring could mitigate
mining adverse effects.

This leads to a practical legal problem: the decision of the Constitutional
Court, regardless of its relative and surmountable nature, thanks to the use
of increasingly sophisticated methods or systems aiming at guaranteeing
envir lly friendly and inable respectful mining as well as the

application of increasingly efficient monitoring tools, could result in the
acceptance of mining even in fragile ecosystems such as paramos.

The paragraphs declared unenforceable were intended to promote the above:
tolerance for mining under environmental neutral conditions, guaranteed
through administrative acts that made exploration and mining conditional on
the observance of strict environmental protection standards by those title
holders that obtained said titles before the entry into force of the legal
prohibition of mining in paramos.

“Sector minero crece pese a la amenaza de la inseguridad juridica”, El Mundo [English Translation]
(11 May 2017) (Exhibit C-243).

334/387

794, Eco Oro sought clarification from both the ANM and ANLA as to the effect of this judgment

In a state governed by the rule of law, a legislative decision that responded
to an initiative of the Executive smoothly translated into an act of
government: not allowing mining in paramo ecosystems unless a prior mining
contract has been executed.

The existence of a mining contract forced the Legislature and the Executive
to permanently safeguard public heritage from potential monetary claims for
wrongful damage attributable to the Legislature. At the same time, the rule
provided for the protection of the ecosystem through legal instruments such
as the issuance of environmental licenses and the implementation of
monitoring tools. [...]

Notwithstanding the above, the Court has handed down its opinion and it is
final. Legal enforcement agencies such as the Mining Authority are now
abiding by a legal provision that, as certain subsections of the first
paragraph of Article 173 of Law No. 1753 are no longer enforceable,
amounts to an absolute interference with contractual rights and affects,
from a mining point of view, contracts executed, and investments made,
under the regulations in force at the time, which could potentially cause
unlawful damages to those who, on the basis of the contract, and legitimate
expectations [confianza legitima], carried out investments which could be
deemed to have been indirectly expropriated, as a consequence of the
unconstitutionality decision.

Evidently, this situation raises national and international concerns in light of
investment protection treaties. Therefore, the judgment handed down by the
Constitutional Court needs to be clarified so that the applicable
(environmental, mining or hydrocarbon) enforcement agency can perform
its duties in a proper manner and in compliance with the law, through the
implementation of the administrative act that best suits the purpose of
protecting the paramo, at all times mitigating the potential damage that
may be caused to those adversely affected by the declaration of
unconstitutionality.”* [Tribunal’s emphasis]

on its concession but none was forthcoming. The Tribunal does not find this surprising given
the obvious confusion this judgment created in both MinMinas and MinAmbiente as well as
in the ANM and indeed more widely. This can be seen, for example, from the unchallenged
evidence of Mr. Moseley-Williams*!* and from a statement from the Environment Minister

in March 2016, that pursuant to Judgement C-35, all existing environmental licenses shall

“cease to be in force” and that they were working with MinMinas “to make a decision
regarding [mining] titles currently in force to have them terminated on the basis of the
Constitutional Court decision.”*'> Again, in a letter dated 11 May 2016, MinAmbiente
advised that by analogy with Judgement C-35, the grandfathering provision in Law 1753
must be treated as having “disappeared from the legal framework since” Judgement C-35

was entered.*!6

795. Itis further clear that there was utter confusion as to whether mining activities were permitted
in the restoration and sustainable use areas of the paramo. The relevance of this for Eco Oro

was that the Restoration Zone covered nearly 30% of the area of the Angostura Deposit.

796. This confusion can be seen from the following differing and untransparent approaches of

MinMinas, MinAmbiente, CIIPE and the ANM:

a. MinAmbiente advised that restoration areas in traditional mining communities and
sustainable use areas were not encompassed by the prohibition enacted by

Judgment C-35.

b. The approach of MinMinas and the ANM was not consistent with MinAmbiente’s
approach (indeed it was not even internally consistent) as can be seen from the
manner in which Eco Oro’s request for its final extension of the exploitation period

was dealt with:

i. By Resolution 839 dated 2 August 2016, Eco Oro’s application to extend
Concession 3452 was only granted in respect of that area which did not
overlap the preservation area, with no reference to what it was and was not
permitted to do in the restoration area. Resolution 839 referred to a
technical opinion dated 1 August 2016 on which it had relied, which
differentiated between the Santurban Paramo area and the restoration zone

but which further concluded that in addition to the ban on exploration

(Exhibit C-231).

336/387

activities in the paramo, the ban should also be applied to mining activities

within the restoration zone.*!”

However, a contradictory approach was adopted by the ANM with respect
to another mining title of Eco Oro (EJ1-159) which also overlapped the
preservation and restoration areas of the delimited paramo, yet the ANM’s
Resolution 48 dated 7 April 2016 (but only notified to Eco Oro on
20 September 2016) granted an extension of the exploration phase over the
entire area of the Concession. This indicates further confusion within the

ANM as to the status of the restoration zone.

iii. Upon seeking clarification, the ANM advised with respect to title EJ1-159
that Eco Oro could carry out mining activities in those areas that did not
overlap the preservation areas. Thus, with respect to Concession 3452,
Eco Oro could not undertake exploration activities in the restoration zone
whereas with respect to title EJ1-159 it was permitted to undertake
exploration activities in the restoration zone. This is clearly completely

contradictory.

iv. This inconsistent behaviour can further be seen in ANM Resolution 683 of
9 August 2017 which stated that Eco Oro could not undertake mining
activities in any overlapping sustainable use areas in another of Eco Oro’s

Concessions, number 22346.*!*

c. The CIIPE (which included the Minister of the Environment and the Vice Minister
of Mines) understood that the mining ban covered the preservation and restoration

zones of the 2090 Atlas.

. The level of uncertainty as to what was and was not permitted can also be seen from a
statement made by the Director General of the CDMB who, albeit expressing a personal

view, stated that mining activities would be permitted in the restoration zone but not in the

preservation zone and that he was unsure whether any buffer zone would be required or
whether mining activities would be permitted up to the boundary of the delimited area.
However, he noted that the uncertainty would prevent the CDMB from processing an

application for an environmental licence for Concession 3452.°!°

A further example of the inconsistent treatment received by Eco Oro relates to the sums
charged by way of surface canons. Up to July 2016 (thus including a period after the 2090
Atlas had been issued), the ANM had claimed, and Eco Oro had paid, surface canons based
on the total area of Concession 3452. On 6 July 2016, after Judgment C-35 had been handed
down, the ANM changed its policy and sought payment only in respect of that part of the
concession area which did not overlap the preservation area of the Santurban Paramo

(49.27% of the concession area).

In a final twist, Constitutional Court Decision T-361 struck down Resolution 2090 and thus
also the 2090 Atlas, and ordered that a new delimitation of the Santurban Péramo be
undertaken. Whilst it was stated that the new delimitation was to take into account the
criteria set out in Resolution 2090, there was a marked lack of clarity as to the true meaning
and effect of this decision given the vague terms used and a number of questions were raised.
What was the status of the Santurban Paramo at this point? It was unclear precisely what
was meant by the Constitutional Court’s requirement that the protection offered by the new
delimitation to be carried out cannot be lower “as to the protection of the environment” than
that provided by Resolution 2090. Given it also specified that the demarcation of the
Santurban Paramo could be modified in the event of errors (and it was accepted that the 2090
Atlas contained errors), could this mean the boundary lines could not be reduced at any
point? Or did it mean that where there were accepted errors, the boundary could be redrawn
even if it meant a reduced area of protection? Or indeed did it mean that if the paramo
boundary was reduced in one area it had to be increased in another area so as to ensure the
total area within the paramo stayed the same or was even increased? Indeed, how could it
be verified whether any subsequent demarcation provided lower or higher protection — the

paramo is the paramo and once it is fully protected it surely cannot be protected to an even

802.

greater extent? The Constitutional Court further stated that any ensuing modification could
not adversely affect measures to protect or safeguard the paramo “in global terms” without
providing any clarification as to what this meant. Yet more uncertainty was generated by
this decision and yet the Constitutional Court’s order to MinAmbiente that the delimitation

be completed within one year was not complied with.

A week after the publication of Judgment T-361, the Environment Minister stated that
pursuant to this decision, no environmental licenses could be issued for mining projects in
the vicinity of the Santurban Paramo until the new delineation had been completed and yet,
even as of now, no delimitation has been undertaken and there is still no certainty as to where
the boundary of the Santurban Paramo falls and the extent to which there is overlapping with

Concession 3452.

The effect of this on Eco Oro can be seen from the fact that, after Judgment T-361 had been
issued, the ANM refused to give Eco Oro an extension for its exploration phase to enable it
not to have to take any further steps until after the boundaries of the paramo were certain.
This meant that Eco Oro had to submit its PTO by June 2018 failing which it would forfeit
its concession. However, until the delimitation was published, it was uncertain in what areas
of Concession 3452 mining activities would or would not be permitted. The Tribunal fails
to comprehend how Eco Oro could have been expected to undertake this exercise given
Colombia’s continued failure finally to delimit the paramo. And yet, whilst Colombia was
refusing to give any extension of time to Eco Oro, it was itself seeking an eight-month
extension of time to comply with the time limit imposed by the Constitutional Court to

complete the delimitation of the Santurban Paramo.

Further failure to act can be seen from the fact that whilst Article 5 of Resolution 2090
required regional environmental authorities such as CDMB to issue more detailed
environmental guidelines and environmental management plans for the paramo in their
locality, again this has yet to be undertaken with respect to the Santurban Paéramo.
This failure renders the provision in Article 173 of Law 1753 that mining activities would
not be permitted in paramo ecosystems if environmental damage could not be avoided

difficult to apply in practice.

In considering the level of consistency (or inconsistency) in Colombia’s actions the Tribunal

 

also notes that various laws, resolutions and court decisions, commencing with Law 373
of 1977, imposed on Colombia an obligation to acquire (and hence first delimit) paramo
areas in compliance with its constitutional duties.**° Colombia did not do this. It is
approximately twenty years since the 2001 Mining Code set out the regulatory regime to
achieve a final delimitation of the Santurban Paramo and yet the Santurban Paramo has still
not been finally delimited and no reason for this has been given. Indeed, the Constitutional
Court noted in Judgment T-361 that “according to the information provided by the Alexander
von Humboldt Institute, there are currently 385 mining concessions in force related to

paramo areas that have not been delimited by the Ministry of the Environment.”*?!

The Tribunal notes that its analysis with respect to Article 805 is as to legitimate expectations
and not “reasonable investment-backed expectations”, as is the case with an Article 811

analy:

 

Having weighed up the respective positions of the Parties, the majority of the
Tribunal finds that Eco Oro had legitimate expectations that (i) it would be entitled to
undertake mining exploitation activities in the entirety of Concession 3452; (ii) in the event
the State were to expropriate Eco Oro’s acquired rights, compensation would be payable;
and (iii) that Colombia would ensure a predictable commercial framework for business
planning and investment. The majority of the Tribunal finds that Colombia’s actions in
refusing to allow mining exploitation activities to take place in the entire area of
Concession 3452 without payment of compensation, its inconsistent approach to the
delimitation of the Santurban paramo and its ultimate (and continuing) failure to delimit the

Santurban Paramo frustrated Eco Oro’s legitimate expectations.

A majority of the Tribunal finds that Colombia’s actions, including its failure finally to
delimit the Santurban Paramo in circumstances where Eco Oro was advised that no

environmental licenses could be issued for mining projects in the vicinity of the Santurban

This obligation was also contained in Article 8 of Resolution 769 of 2002, Advisory Opinion 2233 at

Paramo until the new delineation had been completed and the failure to give Eco Oro an
extension to submit its PTO, comprise conduct that failed to provide Eco Oro with a stable

and predictable regulatory environment.

 

(b) Are Colombia’s actions sptable from an is ional law
perspective?
The Tribunal now turns to consider whether Colombia’s frustration of Eco Oro’s legitimate
expectations is unacceptable from an international law perspective. In this regard, it should
be noted a finding of bad faith is not required.*? The fact the majority of the Tribunal found
Colombia did not act in bad faith in implementing the Challenged Measures does not mean,
per se, that Colombia is not in breach of Article 805. Whilst the intention of the Challenged
Measures may have been in good faith, the delimitation is still not finally completed such
that Eco Oro was left in limbo for a very considerable period of time, with no certainty as
to where the final boundaries of the delimited boundary would be sited, and yet equally not
granted an extension of time to file its PTO and seek an environmental licence
pending Colombia’s publication of the final delimitation undertaken in compliance with

Colombian law.

Colombia will be in breach of Article 805 if it has acted in an unjust or arbitrary manner as

understood under customary international law.

Colombia saw an exponential increase of the granting of mining titles in paramo areas at a
time where it was clear from legislation (international and domestic) and Colombian caselaw

that paramos should be subject to special protection. According to the Indicators of Mining

in Colombia, Monitoring the National Mining Development Plan 2007-2010: “The National
Government's policies, such as Decree 4743 of 2005, have boosted this result and have given
continuity to the Vallejo Plan, which, since 1967, has granted a series of tariff exemptions
to imports of machinery and equipment used in the mining cycle, as well as to activities
related to the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons. [...] Similarly, in the mining
sector, investments increased from US$466 million in 2002 to approximately US $3.054

billion in 2009, an increase of 555%.”*>

In Judgment C-35, Constitutional Court commented on Colombia’s continued failure to

protect the paramo ecosystems by delimiting the paramos as follows:

“135, [...] although paramos are ecosystems that, pursuant to the law, call
for special protection, they are not protected areas per se, since the ‘protected
area’ category is tied to a declaratory and implementation procedure by the
environmental authorities. In other words, although these ecosystems have
been identified as areas that require special protection, no category of
specific or automatic protection has been regulated for such biomes. To that
extent, at present there are paramo areas that have been declared to be
protected areas and others that have not.

[J

140. [...] Therefore, to the extent that the protection of the paramo ecosystem
depends directly on strict compliance with the delimitation duty by the
Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development, the Court shall
integrate the regulatory unit with the first two subsections of section 173 of
Law No. 1753 of 2015 since, to the extent that the responsibility to delimit
paramo areas lies with the Ministry of the Environment, the decision to be
adopted would be completely ineffective, especially if we take into account
that the Ministry of the Environment has delimited only one paramo.

(December 2010) (Exhibit C-277).

342/387

165. First, the Court would like to note that the Legislature is currently
working on two bills in the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate to
establish a general framework to protect paramo ecosystems. At the speech
for the second debate before the Plenary Session of the Senate to discuss Bill
No. 45 of 2014 (Senate), the legislature acknowledged that ‘[p]aramos should
be protected permanently, because they are not isolated and are related to
other systems that have suffered serious impacts in terms of thaw levels and
loss of vegetation cover and glacier masses. Paéramos are closely related to
glaciers, and specialized literature has warned that in 30 years’ time,
approximately, snow would no longer occur in the country if current
conditions persist. In that regard, the IDEAM has warned that, while
Colombia had 17 glaciers in 1850, at present only 6 glaciers continue to exist,
decreasing from 374 km2 to 45.3 km2, and this phenomenon has accelerated
over the last 30 years.’

In turn, at the speech for the first debate on the Bill No. 106 of 2015
(Representatives), note was made of ‘[...] the importance of relying on a
regulatory instrument to assert greater legal and technical strictness
regarding the conservation and protection of paramo complexes and paramo
ecosystems in Colombia. Such bill should be in line with the current
environmental and socio-economic conditions in those areas, reiterating
their nature as strategic ecosystems, as an integral part of the Protected
Areas National System. With a view to the foregoing, it should include a clear
definition of the financing sources for the implementation and application
thereof. Likewise, the participation and mandatory and priority cooperation
of the different administrative authorities in the different orders, not only in
the declaratory process, but also in the execution of the respective
environmental management plans [...].’

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this was not the first attempt to create a legal
provision concerning the exclusive protection of paramos. Indeed, over the
last decade there have been several attempts to expand a law to design
paramo protection measures, but such attempts have proven fruitless, and the
bill has been disregarded and all of the projects have been shelved. [...]

  

166. Based on the considerations made above, it is clear that, at present,
paramos as ecosystems are not subject to special protection, nor has the use
thereof been defined, nor has an authority specifically responsible for their
administration, management and control been appointed. In spite of all the
attempts to create regulations to protect paramos, the truth is that there is a
statutory and regulatory deficit in complying with the constitutional mandate
to protect areas of special ecological importance, in this case, paramo
ecosystems.

[.]

343/387

167. [...] there is no present guarantee that paramos are being protected.
[4

810. Whilst the Tribunal accepts that Article 805 cannot be invoked to restrain Colombia from

81

824

regulating matters within its borders, it can be invoked where the State acts in an arbitrary
manner. Even viewed in isolation, it is difficult to comprehend on what basis the
delimitation of the Santurban Paramo has still not been undertaken. No reason has been
given by Colombia and, although the Tribunal understands that a paucity of resources may
have contributed to the length of time taken to prepare the 2090 Atlas, this cannot excuse the
fact the delimitation has still not been concluded so many years after the process was initially
commenced. Indeed, the fact that, even after the Constitutional Court ordered the
Environment Ministry to complete the delimitation within a year of Decision T-361, such
delimitation has still not been completed is grossly unfair to those such as Eco Oro whose
rights depend upon knowing where mining is and is not permitted. Even after the Santander
Administrative Tribunal opened contempt proceedings against the Minister of Environment
for failure to progress the delimitation in violation of Judgement T-361, the delimitation has
still not been concluded. This failure is also clearly troubling in the light of the FTA’s
express terms as to the importance of environmental preservation. Had the delimitation been
undertaken in accordance with Judgment T-361 it could be understood that Colombia was
acting pursuant to a legitimate purpose, but this is not the case with respect to a failure to

delimit the paramo whilst suspending rights granted under the Concession.

. The Tribunal also notes that, when considering the reasonableness of both Colombia’s

actions and more particularly its failure to act, it is of relevance that the Angostura Deposit
comprised less than 1% of the Santurban Paramo as delimited by the discredited 2090 Atlas
and thus, whilst the Tribunal accepts the applicability of the precautionary principle, it
should also not be ignored that it is not possible accurately to determine the actual threat of
damage to the paramo. Indeed, whilst of course Eco Oro could have reached certain

assumptions as to the likely parameters of the Santurban Paramo, the Tribunal does not

344/387

believe it is reasonable to expect Eco Oro to prejudge the boundaries of the final delimitation

in circumstances where Colombia has itself failed to determine the boundaries.

812. The Tribunal also does not accept Colombia’s submission that all arms of the Government

were working towards the same objective, namely the preservation of the paramo.

813. The Constitutional Court acknowledged in Judgment C-35 that:

“Long-term environmental effects, that is, the environmental sustainability of
a legal provision, is a decisive factor for constitutionality review. It is up to
the legislative and executive branches of the Government to meet the
population’s immediate needs, and from this standpoint, they are especially
concerned with guaranteeing that the Government obtains revenue from the
fees and taxes on extraction activities. However, in a democratic system, it is
up to the constitutional courts to counterbalance the short-term importance
valued by the other branches of government, especially if elected
democratically. In this way, although the constitutional courts shall not
discard the short-term effects, they should consider especially the long-term
effects, which offer a full panorama of the constitutional problem and the
tension with legally protected interests. Thus, it should give special weight to
the effects of mining and hydrocarbon activities on paramo ecosystems.”*?5

814. Given the increasing and dominant focus on the protection and preservation of the

environment, as seen from the Constitutional Court judgments referred to above, the actions
of Government officials, including even President Santos, in supporting a mining project
which undoubtedly was in or neighbouring an area which Colombia had undertaken to
protect is hard to comprehend other than that such actions were supportive of Eco Oro mining
the Angostura Deposit. It is recognised that Colombia saw the mining industry as key to its
economic growth but the existence of the Santurban Paramo was known at that time to
Colombia. Whilst MinMinas’ objective of promoting foreign investment into the mining
sector, providing support to Eco Oro and wanting the Angostura Project to succeed in order
to encourage other foreign investment is understandable, the support to Concession 3452
and indeed to the other foreign mining companies and those local mining communities ran
directly contrary to the parallel obligation to ascertain the correct delimitation of the

Santurban Paramo and take the necessary steps to protect it. The conflicting motivations of

826

MinMinas (in its drive for investment) and MinAmbiente (seeking the protection of the

paramos) could not be clearer.

It can be seen from the above review that not only were there at all times two competing
approaches within the Colombian ministries, on the one hand the need for the economic
benefits derived from a vibrant mining industry and on the other a belief in the need to protect
the paramo, but there was also a complete lack of agreement or even co-ordination in any
part of the Government as to what should be done with respect to the delimitation of the
Santurban Paramo. This did not need to be the case. As stated by the Attorney General, the
delay in completing the delimitation of the paramo created an environment in which it
appeared that “the development of an environmentally responsible mining industry is

incompatible with the conservation of the environment {...].”°*6

The effect of this has been a near total failure to resolve the competing demands of the
relevant interests: the environment, the need for water in the surrounding areas, the
livelihood of the local farmers and artisanal miners, protection of jobs provided by the
foreign mining companies and the rights of those mining companies. It has also contributed

to the existence of illegal mining with the inevitable harmful impact on the paramo.

The Tribunal notes that there are a number of contemporaneous records detailing the

existence of illegal mining. By way of example:

a. Various articles were published describing the emergence of illegal mining in the
Santurban Paramo including one published in Portofolio on 6 February 2014 titled
“Tllegal mining creeps into parts of Santurban” in which it was noted that the towns
of Vetas and California “have been the most seriously affected” and that mercury
and explosives were being used in these operations and another dated 1 August

2014 reporting that the number of illegal miners illegally entering the tunnels of

those mining companies that had had to suspend mining (such as Eco Oro) was in

the region of 1,000.*?

b. Eco Oro issued a communique on 25 February 2014 to the community of

Soto Norte containing a “respectful but firm call to the people” to refrain from

carrying out illegal mining operations;*”*

c. Minister Sarmiento was reported to have assured the mayors that tough measures

would be announced to clamp down on such illegal mining.*°

d. A letter from the Municipality of Vetas to the Attorney General dated
20 February 2015 seeking his intervention before the MinAmbiente for assistance

for the local community and noting that “illegal mining is increasingly becoming

the only option for workers to make a living.”**°

e. On 2 June 2016 a Ms. Uribe (citizen of Bucaramanga) wrote to the Vice President,

noted that: “4s regards illegal mining, different strategies are being implemented,

to exploit them. Inter-institutional roundtables have been established with formal
companies in order to adjust their PTO. In any event illegal mining activities in
the paramo area require more decisive planning based on the CONPES
(Colombian Council of Economic and Social Policy). Coordination with the
National Planning Department (DNP) and the Ministries of Environment, of Mines
and Energy and of Defence shall be progressed in order to define a schedule and

action plans regarding any paramos to be delimited in the future.

As regards security issues, the Ministry of Defence has requested that the
companies strengthen their private security. Furthermore it was noted that the
Ministry of Mines and Energy and the Governor's Office are working on a
productive change programme which will include 5,000 people in Vetas and 2,000

people in California.”**

ANM decided a suspension request submitted by Eco Oro with respect to
Concession Contract No. 22346 concluding that Eco Oro’s obligations should be
suspended on the basis of force majeure, considering “the presence of illegal
groups and the carrying out of illegal mining activities in the area of the

mining title.”*4

818. Indeed, Colombia accepts that “illegal mining has been always a problem in Colombia, and

834

not only in paramo areas, all over Colombia. So, illegal mining is something that the

Government takes very seriously, and it is attacking the illegal mining. And I make a

parentheses because it is not only linked with ancestral mining, in areas where mining has
taken place since forever, but also because it has some links in some instances to a grave
situation and to natural consequences. So, it is something that Colombia takes extremely
serious, and it is something that is not exclusively related to the paramo. Actually, it is less
marketed in paramo areas than in other areas in the country. I will not dwell on that. But
the second point is also very important because precisely I mentioned it before, that
Colombia's interpretation of paramo has enacted clearly that, even if they, through human
intervention has been deterioration in the paramo, that doesn’t take out the qualification of
paramo, and, actually, on the contrary, that insists that this sort of restoration area, areas
in which the paramo has been degraded and, therefore, has to be reinstated to whatever kind
of measures can be taken. And on the measures taken is, first of all, try to avoid illegal
mining, try to prevent alternatives to the people because there is not only illegal mining,
there is literature--there is other aspects of human intervention that may deteriorate the

paramos. So, that’s the situation in Colombia.”*°>

It is not in dispute that illegal mining is generally far more harmful to the environment than
mining undertaken lawfully in compliance with an approved EIA. In circumstances where
it is acknowledged that the paramo is fragile and in need of special protection such that the
State has determined no mining activities should be permitted in the paramo ecosystem, as
well as taking steps to prevent mining activities lawfully undertaken pursuant to a legal title,
Colombia should have taken steps to prevent the more damaging activities carried out by
illegal miners. Whilst it is clear that Colombia was aware of the issue, proposing inter-
institutional coordination and establishing inter-institutional roundtables, the Tribunal has
not seen any evidence as to actual action taken by Colombia other than to require the

companies to strengthen their private security.**°

The majority of the Tribunal finds that Colombia’s actions with respect to the delimitation

of the Santurban Paramo have been grossly inconsistent and given rise to considerable

what is going to happen.”).

349/387

837

confusion and uncertainty as to (i) what activities may and may not be undertaken within the
paramo as currently delimited; (ii) what the final boundaries will comprise; and (iii) when
the final delimitation will be announced. The Tribunal therefore asks itself whether
Colombia’s conduct amounts to gross unfairness or manifest arbitrariness falling below
acceptable standards. The majority of the Tribunal answers this in the affirmative.
Colombia’s failure to lawfully and finally delimit the Santurban Paramo in breach of the
Constitutional Court’s judgement is a wilful neglect of Colombia’s statutory duty and caused
harm to Eco Oro as it was made clear that no environmental licenses could be issued for
mining projects in the vicinity of the Santurban Paramo until the new delimitation had been
completed. Colombia’s refusal to allow Eco Oro a concomitant extension of time to submit
its PTO, in circumstances where the paramo boundary had not been finally determined such
that Eco Oro had no certainty as to where the paramo overlapped with the Angostura Deposit,
if at all, and where Colombia itself was being given extensions of time to complete the
delimitation, can only be viewed as grossly unfair. This comprises conduct that was arbitrary
and disproportionate, and which has inflicted damage on Eco Oro without serving any

apparent purpose, falling within Professor Schreuer’s first indicium.

Whilst the bar is a high one and the Tribunal does not expect that Colombia should have
elevated unconditionally Eco Oro’s interests above its obligation to protect the paramo,
equally Colombia should have ensured that its various arms took the necessary steps to
comply with Colombia’s constitutional obligation to protect the paramo such that they acted
in parallel and in a coordinated manner with respect to Concession 3452. It should be
reminded that, for purposes of attribution, “[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be
considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises
legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the
organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central
Government or of a territorial unit of the State.”*>" It is clear from the above review of
Colombia’s actions, viewed as a whole, that Colombia’s approach to the delimitation of the

Santurban Paramo was one of arbitrary vacillation and inaction which inflicted damage on

Eco Oro without serving any apparent legitimate purpose. Colombia was not willing to
address and manage the widely disparate interests of those impacted by where the boundary
of the Santurban Paramo was drawn; it found itself torn between the competing interests of
protecting the paramo and obtaining much needed royalties. It has failed to act coherently,
consistently or definitively in its management of the Santurban Paramo and in so doing has
infringed a sense of fairness, equity and reasonableness and indeed has shown a flagrant
disregard for the basic principles of fairness. This is more than just inconsistency or
inadequacy by Colombia and its officials. Colombia has not accorded Eco Oro’s investment
treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of
treatment of aliens, including the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, and the

Tribunal therefore finds by a majority that Colombia is in breach of article 805 of the FTA.

838,

“(3) For the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the
requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that
constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investment
or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade
or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent
a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary:

(a) To protect human, animal or plant life or health, which the Parties
understand to include environmental measures necessary to protect
human, animal or plant life and health;

The Tribunal does not accept Colombia’s construction of Article 2201(3).°°°

Pursuant to Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the Tribunal’s task is to interpret this provision “in

good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in

their context and in the light of its object and purpose.”**°

The Preamble to the FTA details, inter alia, that its object and purpose is to ensure a

predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment in a manner that is

841

consistent with environmental protection and conservation. Canada accepts that “the

Parties [to the FTA] did not view their investment obligations as being at odds with the

protection of [....] their environment and human rights obligations. and that “trade and

environment policies are mutually supportive [...]’.°* In determining the ordinary meaning

of Article 2201(3) it is therefore necessary to understand, as has been held by the Tribunal,

that neither environmental protection nor investment protection is subservient to the other,

they must co-exist in a mutually beneficial manner.

In the context of the FTA’s object and purpose, the Tribunal construes Article 2201(3) as
being permissive, ensuring a Party is not prohibited from adopting or enforcing a measure
to protect human, animal or plant life and health, provided that such measures are not
arbitrary or unjustifiably discriminatory between investment or between investors or a
disguised restriction on international trade or investment. Such a construction is consistent
with the FTA’s objective of environmental protection: by prohibiting an investor from
applying for restitution pursuant to Article 834(2)(b), the State is not precluded from
adopting or enforcing the measure in question. Equally, however, there is no provision in
Article 2201(3) permitting such action to be taken without the payment of compensation.
Given that the FTA is equally supportive of investment protection, had it been the intention
of the Contracting Parties that a measure could be taken pursuant to Article 2201(3) without
any liability for compensation, the Article would have been drafted in similar terms as Annex
811(2)(b), namely making explicit that the taking of such a measure would not give rise to
any right to seek compensation under Chapter Eight. In this regard, it is of note that there is
no reference in Article 2201(3) to claims for breaches of the FTA. Indeed, given that the
Contracting Parties drafted other provisions, such as Annex 811(2)(b), to include an express
stipulation as to the circumstances in which a measure is not to constitute a treaty breach, it
is simply not credible that the Contracting Parties left such an important provision of non-

liability to be implied when considering the operation of Article 2201(3).

The Tribunal therefore construes Article 2201(3) such that whilst a State may adopt or
enforce a measure pursuant to the stated objectives in Article 2201(3) without finding itself
in breach of the FTA, this does not prevent an investor claiming under Chapter Eight that

such a measure entitles it to the payment of compensation.

This construction comports with Colombian constitutional law (as described above).
Further, if all measures that were not arbitrary, not unjustifiably discriminatory between
investment or between investors or were not a disguised restriction on trade and which were

taken to protect the environment gave rise to no liability on the part of the State, it would

render certain provisions of Chapter Eight redundant. For example, the reference to
environmental measures in Article 807(2) would be otiose. Such a construction also
conflicts with Annex 811(2)(b) which expressly acknowledges that in certain circumstances
a measure taken for the protection of the environment may constitute indirect expropriation.
If Colombia’s construction were correct, there would be a clear conflict between Article
2201(3) and Annex 811(2)(b): a State would refer to Article 2201(3) asserting that as a result
it had no liability to pay any compensation, whereas the investor would refer to Annex
811(2)(b) in support of its right to claim damages. Colombia did not explain this

inconsistency.

Colombia also provided no justification as to why it is necessary for the protection of the
environment not to offer compensation to an investor for any loss suffered as a result of
measures taken by Colombia to protect the environment, nor explained how such a
construction would support the protection of investment in addition to the protection of the

environment.

The Tribunal’s interpretation is reinforced by the title of this Article, namely “General
Exceptions” and the fact it expressly refers to being an exception to Chapter Eight. To be
an exception to Chapter Eight must equally mean there are applicable provisions in
Chapter Eight, such that there must be circumstances in which an investor needs to seek
recourse to arbitration with respect to a measure which comes with the meaning of
Article 2210(3), which can only be to claim compensation for losses suffered as a result of

such measure.

The Tribunal’s analysis is supported by the decision of the tribunal in Bear Creek which
considered an identical provision. Whilst Colombia refers to this as a single decision,*“* this

does not lessen its validity as supporting the Tribunal’s construction of the provision.**>

Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 466.

The second case cited by Eco Oro, Infinito, relates only to whether Article 2201(3) acts as a jurisdictional
hurdle and is therefore of no relevance to this issue.

354/387

835. The Tribunal’s analysis is further supported by the provisions of Articles 27(b) and 36(1) of
the ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ILC

Draft Articles”),**° which establish as follows:

“Article 27

Compensation

1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an

836. Canada, in its non-disputing party submission, says that if the measure in question meets the
requirements of Article 2201(3) then “[...] there is no violation of the Agreement and no
State liability. Payment of compensation would therefore not be required.”**’ Whilst the
Tribunal accepts that the State cannot be prohibited from adopting or enforcing an
environmental measure in accordance with Article 2201(3), it cannot accept Canada’s
statement that in such circumstances payment of compensation is not required. This does
not comport with the ordinary meaning of the Article when construed in the context of the
FTA as a whole and specifically in the context of Chapter Eight, as analysed in the preceding
paragraphs.

VII. DAMAGES
838. Article 834(2) to (4) of the Treaty provides as follows:

“2. Where a Tribunal makes a final award against the disputing Party, the
Tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:

(a) monetary damages and any applicable interest;
(b) _ restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the
disputing Party may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest

in lieu of restitution.

The Tribunal may also award costs and attorney's fees in accordance with
this Section and the applicable arbitration rules.

3. Subject to paragraph 2, where a claim is made under Article 820:

(a) an award of monetary damages and any applicable interest shall
provide that the sum be paid to the enterprise;

(b) an award of restitution of property shall provide that restitution be
made to the enterprise; and

(c) _ the award shall provide that it is made without prejudice to any right
that any person may have in the relief under applicable domestic law.

4. A Tribunal may not order a disputing Party to pay punitive damages.”

evidence” that its loss was proximately caused by Colombia’s actions.**? This, Eco Oro has

failed to do.

Firstly, as explained in detail in Colombia’s submissions on the merits, at the time the FTA
came into force a mining ban was in existence over 54% of the Concession area such that
the value of Eco Oro’s Concession was already compromised and the post cut-off date

measures did not cause any further loss.

Secondly, the burden is on the Claimant to prove the certainty of its damages but Eco Oro’s
claim is inherently speculative. The Angostura Project did not progress beyond the
conceptual exploratory stage despite approximately twenty years of exploration activities,
the asset was non-operative at the time of the alleged wrongful conduct and Eco Oro had no
acquired right to exploit. The Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) calculation performed by
Golder Associates (“Golder”) in Eco Oro’s Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”)
purporting to show the economic viability of the Angostura Project is “utterly flawed and
speculative”.*°° Colombia’s underground mining expert, Mr. Johnson, adjusted Golder’s
DCF to correct for its flaws, to show the Angostura Project yielded a negative net present
value. Mr. Johnson’s assessment is corroborated by the economic behaviour of actual
buyers. Thus, Eco Oro has failed to discharge its burden of proving the economic viability

of the Angostura Project.

It is not to the point that the cases on which Colombia rely for its proposition that damages
should not be awarded for “speculative” projects all relate to damages calculated on a DCF
and not fair market value basis: Behre Dolbear’s expert opinion as to the viability of the

Angostura Project is based on a DCF calculation performed by Golder in Eco Oro’s PEA.

Thirdly, Eco Oro has failed to show that it could have secured an environmental license to
allow it to undertake mining exploitation activities. Pursuant to the General Environmental
Law, Colombia’s licensing authorities were legally prohibited from issuing environmental
licenses for mining exploitation activities where those activities could cause harm to the
paramo. Given the relevant authorities’ strict application of the precautionary principle, it
was “highly improbable” that Eco Oro would have been able to satisfy the ANLA and other
relevant authorities that either an underground or open pit large scale mining project could
cause no harm to the paramo such that but for Colombia’s actions it would have secured an

environmental licence.

Eco Oro is basing its claim for damages on a “remote hypothetical possibility that it may
have, somehow, been able to prepare a viable plan, obtain all necessary licenses and
permissions, and proceeded to extract minerals profitably.”**' There can be no liability for

damages.

(b) Claimant’s Position

Eco Oro refers back to its detailed arguments with respect to the merits. Firstly, there was
no mining ban in force at the time the FTA entered into force. Secondly, it had an acquired
right to exploit notwithstanding that its exercise required fulfilling certain legal requirements
such as obtaining an environmental license. Thirdly, it is for Colombia to prove that Eco
Oro would not have successfully applied for an environmental licence and given Colombia
has issued environmental licenses in paramo areas since the General Environmental Law,
Colombia’s argument as to the manner in which the General Environmental Law and the
precautionary principle will be applied cannot be correct. In any event, the Angostura
Project is not located in paramo as is demonstrated by the ECODES report and it is the
wrongful manner in which Colombia delimited the Santander Paramo that has deprived Eco

Oro of the right to attempt to meet the applicable environmental licensing requirements.

Finally, the Angostura project was not speculative. Eco Oro was a going concern at the time

of the Challenged Measures and Mr. Rossi confirmed in his testimony that “[...] there [are]

851 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 451.

849.

852

reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction” .***

The valuation methodology
applied by Compass Lexecon factors in the risk factors associated with the stage of
development of the Angostura Project by using comparable companies in a similar or earlier
stage of development. The cases referred to by Colombia all relate to damages claimed using

a DCF income-based approach which is not the approach adopted by Eco Oro.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

By a majority, the Tribunal finds that Colombia’s breach of Article 805 entitles it to make a
claim for damages in respect to any loss that it can show to have been caused as a result of

that breach.

The Tribunal has found that there was no mining ban in existence at the time the FTA came
into force. The Tribunal has further found, by a majority, that Eco Oro had an acquired right
to exploit, albeit such right could only be exercised upon its PTO being approved and upon
obtaining an environmental licence to allow it to engage in exploitation. It is common ground
that in absence of such a license Eco Oro could not engage in any exploitation. The Tribunal
further does not find, by a majority, that Eco Oro’s claim is necessarily speculative;
Colombia has not shown that no environmental licences were issued for mining activities in
paramo areas since the General Environmental Law came into force such that the
precautionary principle cannot be said to apply, or that Eco Oro had no prospect whatsoever

of obtaining an environmental licence.

Finally, the Tribunal does not accept, to the extent it is pleaded by Colombia, that it was Eco
Oro’s intervening acts and omissions that caused its loss, that the casual link has been broken
by Eco Oro’s renunciation. To the extent that Eco Oro is able to establish that it has suffered
losses as a result of the breach of Article 805, such losses will have been incurred before the
renunciation of the Concession and the renunciation was effected by Eco Oro in order to

mitigate its continuing losses as detailed in its letters to MinMinas and MinAmbiente.***

‘WHETHER ECO ORO IS ENTITLED TO FULL REPARATION BASED ON FAIR MARKET
VALUE

(1) The Parties’ Positions
(a) Claimant’s Position
(i) Appropriate Methodology

The only provision in the FTA relating to the standard of compensation is Article 811(2)
with respect to lawful expropriation. Eco Oro therefore turns to customary international law
principles as contained in Articles 31, 35 and 36(1) of the ILC Draft Articles.*** These
provide for “full reparation” which, where restitution is not possible, entails “[...] an

obligation to compensate for the damage caused [...]”.

Full compensation should be assessed on the basis of the resultant diminution of the fair
market value of the affected asset. This is the appropriate methodology for valuing the loss

caused by both a breach of Article 811 and Article 805 of the FTA.

An income-based valuation methodology is not appropriate; although a preliminary
economic assessment has been prepared, on the basis of which Behre Dolbear concludes the
Angostura Project would be economically viable, no final plans had been made as to the
development of the project and there is insufficient certainty for a feasibility study. Where
a project is at an early development stage, such as this, the necessary inputs cannot be
established with sufficient precision and an income-based valuation is not the preferred

valuation approach.*°>

In the precious metal mining industry a company’s primary value driver is the volume of
extractable minerals it has the right to exploit and, consistent with the industry-specific
guidance given by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (“CIM”)

special committee on Valuation of Mineral Properties in its Standards and Guidelines for

Valuation of Mineral Properties (“CIMVAL”),**° the fair market value methodology is the
preferred approach for a property at the stage of development that the Angostura Project

was at.

Calculating the fair market value on the basis of Eco Oro’s market capitalisation is
unreliable. Firstly, at the Valuation Date, the market had already priced in the negative effect
of key aspects of the Challenged Measures such that the market capitalisation cannot be used

to derive a fair market value. Secondly, Eco Oro’s stock is thinly traded and highly illiquid.

Colombia’s arguments as to other tribunal’s concerns as to the validity of a market-based
assessment are not applicable here: it is unnecessary to consider a hypothetical buyer as data
is available relating to three genuinely comparable market transactions (the “Comparable

Transactions”).

(ii) The comparable transactions valuation

The Comparable Transactions used are three purchases by AUX Canada of the outstanding
shares (i) in March 2011 of Ventana Gold Corporation (“Ventana”) which held the rights to
develop mining titles located in the California-Vetas Mining District including the
La Bodega and La Mascota deposits (the “Bodega Project”); (ii) in December 2012 of
Galway Resources Ltd. (“Galway”) which held 14 mining titles in the California-Vetas
Mining District; and (iii) also in December 2012, of Calvista Gold Corporation (“Calvista”)
which held the rights to 12 mining titles again in the California-Vetas Mining District
(the “Comparable Companies”). Whilst all three are comparable, the Bodega Project is

the most similar to the Angostura Project in terms of size and mineralisation.

The comparability can be seen as they each concern mining properties (i) located directly
adjacent to and landlocked by Concession 3452 on an eleven kilometre continuous
mineralized stretch of land starting in California and ending at the far end of the Angostura
deposit; (ii) at similar or earlier stages of development than the Angostura Project; (iii) in the
case of the largest Comparable Transaction, involves an underground project similar to the
CIMVAL, Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties (February 2003) (Exhibit C-85). See
also Victor Rudenno, The Mining Valuation Handbook, 4" ed. Milton, Australia: John Wiley & Sons (2012)

(CLEX-74), pp. 284-288.

one projected for Angostura; and (iv) owned by publicly traded Canadian companies subject
to the same regulatory reporting requirements as Eco Oro. Indeed, the extreme level of
comparability can be demonstrated in respect of each of the ten “modifying factors”
identified by the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards

(“CRIRSCO”) in its International reporting Template.**’

They are all independently
identified as “adjacent properties” to each other in their respective NI 43-101 reports
meaning they have “geological characteristics similar to those of the property being
reported on”.*°8 The comparability of these properties answers the concerns raised by the
tribunal in Khan Resources v. Mongolia*® and is consistent with the approaches in a number
of recent cases, such as Windstream v. Canada. This addresses Mr. Rossi’s concerns as

to the mineralization differences between the three projects.

The Comparable Transactions build in equivalent social and political risk market perception
and variations in broader economic conditions affecting gold mining companies that can be
accounted for by adjusting prices using the Junior Gold Mining Index. Indeed, CRA
advances a methodology that is practically identical, but uses additional comparable

transactions in addition to the three chosen by Compass Lexecon.

It is of note that whilst Colombia’s expert, CRA, says that the Comparable Transactions are
not appropriate to be used for valuation purposes, it uses them when calculating its Valuation
Multiple. The other nine transactions and companies used by CRA have underlying
properties that are not as comparable to the Angostura Project or are not appropriate to be

used for valuation purposes with four subject to different economic, political and social

contributions and risk factors, for example a distressed asset in Ecuador, an operation in
China with dissimilar reporting requirements, and four significantly smaller North American

transactions with vastly different mineralization than that at the Angostura Project.

In calculating the value of the Angostura Project, Compass Lexecon first computes a per-
ounce value for the volume of extractable minerals Eco Oro had the right to exploit
(“Extractable Minerals”) based on values ascribed by the market to other comparable
projects. Eco Oro and the Comparable Companies, being publicly traded Canadian mining
companies, report in a standardized manner pursuant to the guidelines established in
NI 43-101.8°! Such NI 43-101-compliant reports are authored by a recognised Qualified
Person and the authors of the reports relied upon by Eco Oro are independent of Eco Oro.
NI 43-101-compliant reports are considered in the industry to be “rigorous and inherently
reliable”.8°° Eco Oro and the Comparable Companies report their Extractable Minerals in
such NI 43-101-compliant reports such that there is a common basis for comparing them and
the Comparable Companies each published NI 43-101-compliant Extractable Minerals

estimates just prior to their sales.

Behre Dolbear have reviewed the estimates prepared by Golder in 2012, Micon International
Limited in 2015 and Eco Oro itself in 2017 and concludes that Eco Oro’s resource base of
the Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent is 2.97 million ounces of gold. Colombia’s expert
Mr. Rossi’s criticism of Behre Dolbear’s inclusion of a value for Extractable Minerals below
the selected cut-off grade is not valid. There are circumstances where an operator will extract
resources below the cut-off grade and further Ventana’s Board of Directors persuaded its
shareholders to reject AUX’s initial offer on the basis, inter alia, that it did not take into
account the fact that “[h]igher commodity prices effectively result in a greater proportion of

the deposit being economically mineable, resulting in a lower cut-off grade and a meaningful

increase in the resource.”**? Some value should be ascribed to such lower grade materials,

albeit significantly discounted vis-a-vis the materials at or above grade.

Further, Colombia’s argument that a deduction should be made for those resources that fall
outside the Preservation Zone of the 2090 Delimitation must fail given that the totality of

Concession 3452 was rendered valueless as a result of the prevailing uncertainty.

Having computed an adjusted transaction enterprise value for each of the Comparable
Companies to capture all market changes between the dates each transaction took place as
against the Valuation Date, Compass Lexecon then derives a common denominator
(the Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent) to apply across the three transactions given each of
the Comparable Companies and Eco Oro have differing amounts of mineral material divided
amongst different mineral resource categories (measured, indicated and inferred). Proven
and probable reserves are valued at 100%, measured and indicated resources have a
weighting of 50% and inferred resources have a weighting of 25%. Such weightings are
used practically uniformly in the mining industry. Compass Lexecon also converts other
extractable minerals (such as silver and copper) to a Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent by
dividing the volume of declared minerals by the ratio of the gold price to the applicable silver

or copper price prevailing on the date of the transaction.

The effective price paid per ounce of Extractable Minerals is ascertained by dividing the
Adjusted Transaction Enterprise Value by the Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent
(the Valuation Multiple) and this figure is multiplied by the Weighted Gold Ounce

Equivalent of Eco Oro’s Extractable Minerals.

This method has been approved by the Tribunal in Crystallex as being a method which is
“[...] widely used as a valuation method of businesses, and can thus be safely resorted to,

provided it is correctly applied, and, especially, if appropriate comparables are used.” *°*

869.

Compass Lexecon has calculated the price paid by AUX per Weighted Gold Ounce
Equivalent, the Valuation Multiple, for each of the three transactions as follows: for the
Ventana transaction, USD 366 (and it should be noted that the Bodega Project is now
operating under the ownership of Minesa (a Mubadala subsidiary) with declared resources
in 2017 of 10.2 million ounces of gold and 58.6 million ounces of silver); for the Galway

transaction, USD 196; and for the Calvista transaction, USD 45.

Compass Lexecon then computes a weighted average of the three Valuation Multiples based
on the relative Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent at each property (Ventana 1.57 million
ounces, Calvista 0.80 million ounces and Galway 0.83 million ounces) to reach a Valuation
Multiple of USD 242 per ounce of Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent. Compass Lexecon
then sense-check this figure by benchmarking it against the multiples implied by the market
capitalisation of publicly traded companies similarly placed to Eco Oro and show that it is a
reasonable metric, falling between the median and the 7" percentile of the observed market

multiples.

Compass Lexecon then multiplies Eco Oro’s resource base of the Weighted Gold Ounce
Equivalent (2.97 million ounces of gold as determined by Behre Dolbear) by the Valuation
Multiple to reach a valuation of USD 696 million (having adjusted to account for certain

private royalty agreements).

(iii) Colombia's proposed market capitalisati ry
Colombia’s market capitalisation methodology was only submitted in Colombia’s
Rejoinder. Whilst Compass Lexecon does not accept that Colombia’s proposed
methodology is correct given the early development stage Eco Oro was at, it does agree that
the three steps proposed by CRA are the correct steps to undertake a market capitalisation
valuation, namely: (i) selection of the base date or last clean date and ascertain the market
capitalisation at that date; (ii) adjustment by reference to how the mining industry would
have evolved up to the valuation date using the Junior Gold Mining Index; and (iii) make
any necessary additional adjustments to reflect such specific factors relating to Eco Oro as

may not have been captured by the Junior Gold Mining Index.

365/387

870.

871.

872.

873.

CRA has not, however, correctly followed these steps in its valuation; it has used data that
is not market based. For example, instead of ascertaining Eco Oro’s market capitalisation
on the base date, (23 April 2010), it takes Eco Oro’s enterprise value instead, a sum that is
USD 80 million lower as a result of cash held by Eco Oro for further investment. Further,
it has made adjustments on the basis of the differential production size between Eco Oro’s
2009 technical report which included a PEA prepared in anticipation of an open-pit mine
and the 2012 Golder Report which was prepared on the basis of an underground mine; this
has no relevance to an inference in the stock price value. CRA have also made no adjustment
for the difference between a minority stake in a stock market transaction with a very small

flotation percentage and the controlling stake.

CRA should have reviewed all market news and press releases between the base date and
the date on which the Golder underground resources were announced to give the market
impact of that assessment compared to the evolution generally in the junior gold mining
industry. Any adjustment to Eco Oro’s market capitalisation should have been effected on
the basis of that public news, calculated by Compass Lexecon to give rise to a reduction in
value of Eco Oro’s stock of 14.7%, which means a market capitalisation of USD 251 million.
This then needs further adjustment as it is the value of a minority stock. A 40% acquisition
premium should be applied to give a market capitalisation of USD 351 million for a

controlling stake and a USD 350 million enterprise value.

(iv) Valuation date

Eco Oro’s loss is its total loss of value in its investment pursuant to NMA Resolution VSC
829 on 8 August 2016 being the date when “the interference has ripened into a more or less

irreversible deprivation of the property rather than on the beginning date of the events.”*°>

Colombia’s argument that the valuation date should be either 19 December 2014 (the date
of the 2090 Resolution) or 8 February 2016 (the issuing of Judgement C-35) should be
ignored: neither of these measures had the effect of irreversibly depriving Eco Oro of its

rights and having instead been chosen on the basis of the prevailing (adverse) market

conditions (the Junior Gold Miners Total Return Index being 46.1 and 44.9% of the value

on Eco Oro’s identified valuation date).

The only possible alternative valuation date is 1 April 2019 when the NMA rejected

Eco Oro’s requests for a suspension of obligations and a request for the filing of its PTO.

(b) Respondent’s Position

The burden is on the Claimant to prove the certainty of its damages*” and Eco Oro’s claim
is inherently speculative. The Angostura Project never progressed beyond the conceptual
level, despite approximately twenty years of exploration activities and was non-operative at
the time of the alleged wrongful conduct with limited, if any, economic value. This is
evidenced by the fact even before the Challenged Measures, Eco Oro’s enterprise value had
fallen below USD 20 million. There can be no liability to compensate for speculative or

uncertain damage.**

(i) Appropriate methodology

CRA refers to the valuation standards and methodologies developed by CIMVAL which
provide for three main approaches: market, income and cost-based.*** Other tribunals have
held that for single-asset, publicly traded companies, the most reliable valuation approach is

to value the asset on the basis of the actual share price of the company as of the relevant

869

valuation date*®’ and CRA adopts the market approach applying actual market data. It is

incontrovertible that the price actually paid for an asset in the market is inherently more

reliable as an indicator of value than the price paid for other assets. Eco Oro’s concerns as

to the illiquidity of its stock issue are not valid; Eco Oro’s stock was traded with sufficient

frequency and volume to be reliable for valuation purposes.

The definition of fair market value is “the price that a willing buyer would normally pay to
a willing seller of the investment, after taking into account all relevant circumstances such
as the nature and duration of the investment.”*”” Given the consequences of the existence
of the paramo, no willing buyer would have valued the Angostura Project using the
methodology applied by Eco Oro. Compass Lexecon relies instead upon an “approach of
valuation by inference from the known values of ‘comparable’ assets.”*"' Such a
comparables analysis should only be used as a reasonableness check against other valuation

methods and not as the primary methodology.

As the economic viability of the Angostura Project has not been established, the market
multiples methodology is “highly conjectural”. Any reasonable (hypothetical) buyer would
assess the technical and economic viability of the Angostura Project, an exercise Compass
Lexecon has not undertaken. The only available analysis is Eco Oro’s PEA which is
insufficient and does not show the project’s viability. Indeed, the document notes it is only
a “[...] preliminary assessment based on conceptual mine plans and process flowsheets.”
Mr. Johnson confirms that reasonable potential purchasers would not rely on a PEA when

considering an acquisition or investment into a junior mining company, being considered no

more than a “scoping study”.’ A serious buyer would develop its own technical due

Reference is also made to Eco Oro’s reliance upon the definition of fair market value adopted by the Iran-US
Claims Tribunal in Starrett, which provides:“the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller in
circumstances in which each had good information, each desired to maximize his financial gain, and neither
was under duress or threat. [The expert] appropriately assumed that the willing buyer was a reasonable
businessman.” See Starrett Housing Corporation, Starrett Systems, Inc, and Others v. The Government of the

diligence to estimate the resources and viability of the project. In the absence of any such
due diligence from Behre Dolbear or Compass Lexecon, Eco Oro cannot be said to have

proved its loss.

Even were a PEA reliable for the purposes of a potential acquisition, Behre Dolbear’s
resource estimation cannot be relied upon. It merely endorses reports prepared by third-
party consultants (and as argued with respect to causation, the Golder PEA is not reliable),
and a non-NI 43-101-compliant report prepared by Eco Oro itself, without carrying out any
actual analysis themselves. NI 43-101 reports are just “marketing tools” with a “significant
bias towards optimism” and are “not accepted at face value, not even by securities
regulators”.* Behre Dolbear also inflates Eco Oro’s alleged loss by: (i) including “/ow
grade resources” and ascribing a value to them; (ii) the use of weighting factors for the
different categories of reserves which are not used in the mining industry; and

(iii) wrongfully ascribing value to Exploration Potential.

Thus, Eco Oro cannot show that any reasonable purchaser would have had a reasonable

expectation that the Angostura Project would have been viable.

(ii) Market capitalisation

Whilst CRA adopts the market approach, it does so on the basis of the actual market data;
CRA follows a three-step process. Firstly, CRA selects a date that predates the market’s
awareness, then it projects the market capitalisation forward to the valuation date by
reference to the movement in price of the market index for listed junior mining companies
between the chosen date and the valuation date. This resolves any concern that the market

had already priced in the effect of the Challenged Measures.

Colombia has calculated Eco Oro’s market capitalisation on the basis of the following base
dates or last clean dates: (i) 23 April 2010 being the last trading day prior to the date on
which Eco Oro publicly disclosed that its EIA licence application had been rejected due to

Mineral Project, in the case it is a motivated seller or is seeking to attract capital investment.” See also Mining
Disclosure: NI 43-101 fundamentals, best practices, and useful guidance for TSX and TSX Venture issuers (4
March 2015) (Exhibit CJ-3).

concerns with regard to the presence of paramo and is the last day on which the market had
not anticipated and priced the possibility of any of Colombia’s measures; (ii) 18 December
2014 being the day before Resolution 2090 was adopted; (iii) 6 September 2013 being the
closest trading day to the cut-off date, 8 September 2013; and (iv) 1 August 2011, the closest
trading day to the day the FTA entered into force on 15 August 2011. These calculations
show market capitalisation ranging between USD 13.79 million and USD 77.53 million
depending on which base date and valuation date are applied. Colombia contends that if

damages are to be awarded, the correct base date is 6 September 2013.

The second step is to adjust the calculated market capitalisation by reference to the Junior
Gold Mining Index to take account of how the industry would have evolved from the base

date to the valuation date.

The third step is a further adjustment of the market capitalisation to take account of any
company specific factors that may not be captured by the evolution of junior gold mining
index. This gives rise to a market capitalisation of USD 78 million on Colombia’s preferred

base and valuation dates.

However, this valuation is for the entire area of the Concession and the residual value of that
part of the deposit not impacted by Resolution 2090 should be deducted, namely 47.7% of
the total Concession area under which is estimated to be approximately 40% of the total
resource.*”* Eco Oro has not adduced any technical or expert evidence to show that no
project was viable in that part of the Concession which did not overlap the paramo and there
was no uncertainty with respect to the ability to mine in the non-overlapping part of the

concession.

(iii) Eco Oro’s Comparable Transactions approach

The methodology adopted by Compass Lexecon is speculative and unreliable.

The three Comparable Companies identified by Compass Lexecon are not sufficiently

comparable to the Angostura Project. It is rare in the mining industry to find assets that are

370/387

888.

889.

876

877

878.

closely comparable. The fact that the deposits are on the same mineralised trend does not of
itself make them comparable as deposits and trends are “complex” and “generally exhibit

> 875

significant differences in short distances The area where the Angostura Project is

located is the subject of extreme variation over a short distance and has a “complex array of

veins, unique to the Angostura deposit”*”®

as a result of events before, during and after
mineralisation. There are significant differences between Angostura and La Bodega and
even considerable geotechnical variation within the La Bodega Project. There are also
differences with Galway and Calvista has a different deposit type, containing “breccias” as
opposed to “veins”.8”” The fact there are differences between the Comparable Transactions
is evident from the fact the per-ounce price paid for each is significantly different, ranging

from USD 78 to 546 per ounce.’

The Comparable Companies are also not genuinely comparable because the relevant
transaction dates were in 2010 and 2011, significantly before Eco Oro’s asserted valuation
date, potentially giving rise to significant additional errors. Finally, three comparables is
insufficient, a broader spread is required, particularly where, as here, each transaction

involves the same buyer.

Compass Lexecon’s analysis is also flawed as not only is the comparable data unreliable, the
underlying data from the Behre Dolbear estimate of resources (based on Eco Oro’s 2017
Resource Estimation) has been demonstrated by Mr. Rossi to be unreliable. The significant
variation in capital costs between the assets requires adjustment which has not been
undertaken and the weighted average approach to the performance values of the Comparable
Transactions distorts the multiple in favour of Eco Oro, increasing the Weighted Gold
Equivalent Ounce from USD 347 per ounce to USD 407 per ounce giving rise to a 15%

inflation in the final valuation.

(Exhibit CRA-14).

371/387

890.

892.

Finally, Compass Lexecon’s bench-check cannot be relied upon as it is performed against a
skewed selection of publicly traded companies that are not comparable to Eco Oro such as
companies at a significantly advanced stage with established economic viabilities or in
countries with lower country risk, but that notwithstanding, the median (USD 124 per
weighted ounce) is still well below Compass Lexecon’s valuation of USD 177 per weighted
ounce. This is why Compass Lexecon adds a 40% acquisition premium to equal the
calculations. There is no place in a fair market valuation for the inclusion of an acquisition

premium.

Whilst Colombia does not accept the validity of a comparables-based valuation in this factual
matrix, it has prepared an alternative valuation based on comparables. Using Eco Oro’s
resource estimations, CRA examines valuation data from twelve properties globally being
the most comparable to the Angostura Project by reason of their inherent characteristics.
From this it can be seen that the Galway and Ventana transactions are clear outliers and CRA
concludes that the enterprise value of Angostura Project would have been USD 180 million.
However, this is not an accurate valuation of Angostura as (i) the data set includes Ventana
(which had lower capital and operating costs); (ii) it includes two companies whose
development was far more advanced than the Angostura Project; and (iii) most of the
companies included were based in countries with lower country risk. It is further of note
that a reasonable buyer would have factored in the risks associated with environmental

licensing and permitting.

(iv) Valuation Date

The correct valuation date should be 19 December 2014, when Resolution 2090 was
issued and Eco Oro lost any right to conduct mining exploitation activities in the area of
Concession 345 falling within the Resolution 2090 delimitation. Alternatively, 8 February
2016 when Judgement C-35 struck down the transitional regime which Eco Oro says it is
entitled to benefit from. Resolution VSC 829 merely confirmed the fact that Eco Oro could
not conduct any mining activities in the area delimited by Resolution 2090, it did not impact
on the extent of Eco Oro’s rights to conduct mining activities. Neither date proposed by

Eco Oro has merit; its loss crystalised earlier, at the time of the Challenged Measures.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal does not have sufficient information at this stage to determine the quantum of

damages, if any, that flow from Colombia’s breach of Article 805.

Given the Tribunal’s majority finding that there was a breach of Article 805 of the FTA, it
is necessary to ascertain the quantum of loss suffered by Eco Oro as a result of that breach.
The Tribunal accepts Eco Oro’s submissions that the appropriate standard is full reparation
for the loss suffered as a result of the breach, as provided for in the ILC Draft Articles, whilst
recognising that the burden is on Eco Oro to establish that loss. Eco Oro does not seek
restitution (nor could it given the terms of Article 2201(3) of the FTA). Where restitution is
not possible, pursuant to Article 36(1) the ILC Draft Articles, a State’s obligation is to pay

compensation for the damage caused.

What is less clear is the nature and extent of the loss suffered by Eco Oro as a result of
Colombia’s breach of Article 805. Eco Oro was not able to engage in exploitation without
an environmental license, and the breach of Article 805 found by the majority precluded Eco
Oro from applying for such a license. The question therefore arises as to whether Eco Oro’s
loss is limited to the value of the loss of opportunity to apply for an environmental licence,
or whether it may also claim for further losses that may be proven to be a direct consequence
of the breach? Relatedly, a question arises as to how such losses, if they occurred, are to

be valued?

The Parties made submissions as to the appropriate methodology for calculating damages.
It is common ground that, given the stage at which the Angustura Project had reached, an
income-based approach would not be appropriate and that the correct methodology is a

market-based methodology. The principles of fair market value are also not in dispute,

9

although the Parties provide slightly different definitions:*” in summary a fair market

See Claimant’s Memorial, para. 374, making reference to the definition in Starrett, Final Award (14 August
1987) (Exhibit CL-7), para. 277: “the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller in circumstances
in which each had good information, each desired to maximize his financial gain, and neither was under duress
or threat. [The expert] appropriately assumed that the willing buyer was a reasonable businessman.”; and
Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 457, making reference to World Bank, “Legal Framework for the
Treatment of Foreign Investment” (1992) (Exhibit CRA-42), p. 26: “the price that a willing buyer would
normally pay to a willing seller of the investment, after taking into account all relevant circumstances such as
the nature and duration of the investment.”

880.

valuation determines the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller, after taking
into account all relevant circumstances such as the nature and duration of the investment and

where neither party is under any duress or threat.

The Parties disagree as to how the fair market value should be determined; on the basis of
Comparable Transactions (as contended for by Eco Oro) or calculating Eco Oro’s market

capitalisation (as contended for by Colombia).

It is also common ground that there is relatively little actual data in the record before the
Tribunal upon which to assess Eco Oro’s loss. No Feasibility or pre-Feasibility study was
undertaken for Eco Oro’s underground mining project for the Angostura Deposit, the PEA
it submitted to the Colombian authorities related to the open-pit mine (which it abandoned
of its own volition) and there is no equivalent document in relation to the underground tunnel
or underground mining. There is also a paucity of independent documentation detailing the
nature and quantum of the Angostura Deposit’s Extractable Minerals. Colombia itself
accepts that, in the absence of the block model, drilling logs, and the information on process
metallurgy and process economics, an independent resource estimation cannot be carried
out**° leaving Eco Oro’s NI 43-101 reports as the only source of available data. Equally, the
Tribunal is not persuaded by Colombia’s market capitalisation methodology in the
circumstances of this dispute, particularly given the fact that there was not a significant
volume of trade in Eco Oro’s stock over the course of the Challenged Measures and the
use by CRA of the Junior Gold Mining Index to adjust Eco Oro’s market capitalisation as
opposed to calculating the impact of the actual market news and press releases

publicly available.

The Tribunal therefore finds that, of the alternative market basis methodologies put forward
by the Parties for determining Eco Oro’s loss, as a matter of principle the Comparable
Transactions methodology may be preferable. However, the Tribunal is uncertain as to

whether — and if so, how — this methodology might be used to value the loss of Eco Oro’s

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 503; First Rossi Report, para. 334.

374/387

900.

901.

right to apply for an approved PTO and environmental licence permitting it to engage in

exploitation.

In preparing its Comparable Transactions analysis, Eco Oro relies on three Comparable
Transactions, whereas Colombia relies on twelve. Whilst the Tribunal appreciates the
concerns raised by Colombia as to whether Eco Oro’s three Comparable Transactions are as
similar as contended for by Eco Oro, it seems to the Tribunal that they have more similarity
to the Angostura Deposit than those proposed by Colombia. The properties identified by
Eco Oro are neighbouring properties on the same mineralised trend, at equally early stages
of development (none having obtained environmental licenses), the sellers were each
publicly traded Canadian companies and the properties are subject to the same country risk.
The Tribunal understands that merely by virtue of the deposits being on the same mineralised
trend does not of itself make them comparable and that there is no certainty that there are no
geotechnical variations between the deposits under the mining titles held by Galway,
Ventana and Calvista and the Angostura Deposit. However, the Tribunal further notes that
they were described as “adjacent properties” in the NI 43-101 reports, which means the
consultant who prepared such reports appears to have taken the view they had similar

geological characteristics.

The Tribunal accepts that the Comparable Transactions took place several years before the
Challenged Measures, but notes that whilst the transactions identified by Colombia are
similar from an economic perspective, there are considerable other differences (excluding
with respect to Ventana, Galway and Calvista which Colombia includes in its identified
comparable properties). In particular, none are in Colombia, which means that the regulatory
and other country risks are different (the Tribunal accepts that for some the country risk may
be smaller). Moreover, one of the properties (Shandong Ruiyin) is not compliant with the
CRIRSCO’s reporting requirements and four of the properties have much smaller sizes than
the Angostura Deposit. Further, just as there is no certainty that the Ventana, Galway and
Calvista deposits had similar geological characteristics to the Angostura Deposit, there is
equally no certainty that the deposits for the properties proposed by Colombia had similar

geological characteristics.

375/387

902. Having weighed up the similarities between the transactions identified by Eco Oro and

88

1

Colombia — and subject to the point made above in relation to the absence of a license to
engage in exploitation — the Tribunal considers that, in the absence of any track record of
established trading, and given the presence of the three similar projects in the vicinity of
Concession 3452, the evidence relating to the three Comparable Transactions identified by
Eco Oro appears to offer the best evidence before the Tribunal as to the methodology that
might be followed. The Tribunal therefore finds it reasonable to consider this approach in
considering what loss has been suffered by Eco Oro. However, there is no evidence before
the Tribunal as to the application of that methodology — or indeed any other — to the valuation
of a loss that could be established as a direct consequence of the loss of the right to apply for
an environmental license. In this context, before the Tribunal determines the quantum of loss
suffered by Eco Oro, the Tribunal raises a number of questions to be addressed by the Parties,
to be supplemented with such expert evidence as the Parties each considers to be necessary
to adduce in support of their further submissions. In this regard, given, as Eco Oro accepts,**!
it has the burden of proof to make its case on damages, Eco Oro is ordered to file its
submissions responsive to the following questions and Colombia is then to file its
submissions in response, if any. To the extent either the Parties agree or the Tribunal so
orders, a second round of sequential reply submissions will be permitted. The questions are

as follows:

a. Are the losses suffered by Eco Oro for a breach of Article 805 and Article 811 the
same, and to be measured in the same way? If not, given the majority Tribunal’s

reasoning, what is the nature of the loss that Eco Oro has actually suffered, if any?

b. Should the expert evidence adduced by the Parties be revised, given the majority
Tribunal’s findings that Colombia is not in breach of Article 811 but is in breach of

Article 805? If so, how?

c. Given the Tribunal’s findings on the merits and given its analysis above with
respect to the inapplicability both of an income-based valuation methodology and

Colombia’s chosen comparable transactions, is Eco Oro’s proposed Comparable

Claimant’s Reply, para. 651.

376/387

Transactions methodology the one to be applied, or is there an alternative

methodology which should be considered given the nature of Eco Oro’s losses?

How can Eco Oro’s loss of opportunity to apply for an environmental licence to
allow exploitation be valued? On what basis is the quantum of that loss, if any, to

be assessed?

What is the probability that the Santurban Paramo overlaps with the Angostura

Deposit and to what extent?

What is the probability that Eco Oro would have been awarded an environmental

licence to allow exploitation in the following scenarios:

i. The Angostura Deposit is not within the boundaries of the paramo as

determined by the final delimitation;

ii. The Angostura Deposit is partially within the boundaries of the paramo as

determined by the final delimitation; or

iii. The Angostura Deposit is wholly within the boundaries of the paramo as

determined by the final delimitation.

What is the effect on the identification of the loss suffered, and its valuation, if any,
if Eco Oro failed to establish that an exercise in due diligence had been carried out

prior to the decision to move to the development of an underground mine?
What is the correct valuation date for a breach of Article 805 of the FTA?

If there is a significant gap between the identified valuation date and the dates on
which the Comparable Transactions took place, what adjustment, if any, should be

made to the Comparable Transactions valuation?

What evidence, if any, is there on the record, in addition to Mr. Moseley-William’s

testimony that the area of Concession 3452 that does not lie within the current

377/387

delimitation cannot be ascribed a value,*** such that no deduction should be made

in the event that a fair market valuation is adopted to value Eco Oro’s loss?

k. What evidence is there to support Eco Oro’s assertion of the costs it has incurred

to date?

(1) The Parties’ Positions
(a) Claimant’s Position

Eco Oro is entitled to full reparation and that includes the payment of interest. The ILC
Draft Articles provide that “[i]nterest on any principal sum payable under this chapter shall
be payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode

of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.”**>

Article 811(3) of the FTA provides that compensation should accrue at a “[...] commercially
reasonable rate [...] from the date of expropriation until the date of payment”.
A commercially reasonable interest rate is the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
plus 4 %**4 and this should be the floor of what is to be considered reasonable. Eco Oro
therefore claims interest at 6.6% being the rate that best represents a “[...] reasonable
commercial rate” by reference to the cost of borrowing “[...] for prime corporations in
Colombia which, on average, is equivalent to 6.6% per year during the relevant period since

the Valuation Date.”**°

This rate should be compounded semi-annually to ensure full reparation. A State’s duty is

to make full reparation immediately after its unlawful act has caused harm and to the extent

such payment is delayed (as is the case here) compound interest compensates Eco Oro for
its lost opportunity to use the funds for productive ends. Compound interest is thus an
element of full reparation as has been held by numerous tribunals.**° As held by the tribunal
in Gemplus, “there is now a form of ‘jurisprudence constante’ where the presumption has
shifted from the position a decade or so ago with the result it would now be more appropriate
to order compound interest, unless shown to be inappropriate in favour of simple interest,

rather than vice-versa.”**"

Eco Oro also claims post-award interest.***

Colombia’s submission with respect to the low risk of enforcement against Colombia does
not address the question of full reparation. The rate at which a private corporation can obtain
financing does not take account of the situation of the borrower and the cases cited by
Colombia do not arise under treaties with the same wording as Article 811(3), which

expressly provides for a “commercially reasonable rate”. A short-term risk-free interest rate

of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not
been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value
which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be of damages for loss sustained which would not
be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it — such are the principles which should serve to

does not take account of the economic realities for Eco Oro, namely that it was subject to
commercial risk after the valuation date and therefore before it renunciated the Concession
it still had to, in that period, raise and maintain capital at a commercial rate. Further, given
the relevant period is three years, this makes the use of a short-term rate inappropriate.
Finally, the rate proposed by Colombia is considerably lower than the cost of financing faced
by most corporations and nearly four times lower than Colombia’s own cost of borrowing

giving rise to a substantial windfall to Colombia in its own costs.

Finally, Colombia is unable to cite any case law to support its submissions with respect to
the inappropriateness of compound interest in this case. Compound interest “[...] reflects the
economic reality that a dollar foregone could otherwise have been invested, and that the
income on that investment could have also been reinvested, so that funds grow at a

compound rate.”**°

(b) Respondent’s Position

Whilst Colombia accepts tribunals have a right to award interest in principle, Article 811(3)
of the FTA is not applicable as it applies only to compensation for a lawful expropriation

and the applicable rate should reflect a “/ow risk” investment*”

compensating for the time
value of money, the loss of purchasing power and certain macroeconomic risks. Eco Oro
faces no commercial or market risk during the pendency of these proceedings and therefore
the applicable rate does not need to compensate for such risks. Finance charges or lost
investment should be claimed as separate heads of damages and Eco Oro has not made any
such claims. The rate should reflect a lower country risk given the fact Colombia has a

strong track record of paying arbitral awards rendered against it.

LIBOR is inappropriate as it includes commercial risks and no justification has been given

for the additional 4%. The applicable interest rate should be a ‘risk free’ rate such as the

Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 94(c). See also M. S. Knoll, “A Primer on Prejudgment Interest”,

US Treasury Bill Rate. This should be payable on any monetary sum awarded to Colombia
in respect of costs, including arbitration costs and professional fees and disbursements made

to Colombia.

. Pursuant to the Commentary to the ILC Draft Articles,*°' compound interest is only

appropriate when justified by “special circumstances” and no such special circumstances

exist in the present case.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal accepts that, to the extent that Eco Oro has suffered loss as a result of
Colombia’s breach of Article 805 of the FTA, Eco Oro should receive full reparation and
such reparation should include interest. The Tribunal further accepts that the appropriate

interest rate should be a commercially reasonable rate.

The Tribunal accepts Eco Oro’s submissions that the US Treasury Bill rate is not a
commercially reasonable rate. The Parties are invited to make any final submissions on what

is a commercially reasonable rate.

D. WHETHER THE AWARD SHOULD BE NET OF ALL APPLICABLE COLOMBIAN TAXES

914.

(1) The Parties’ Positions
(a) Claimant’s Position

Eco Oro submits that, as the valuation prepared by Compass Lexecon is net of Colombian
taxes, any Award should be ordered to be net of all applicable Colombian taxes and
Colombia should be ordered not to tax or attempt to tax the Award. Eco Oro also seeks an
indemnity from Colombia in respect of any adverse consequences that may result from the

imposition of a double taxation liability by the Colombian tax authorities if the declaration

in the Award recognising that the Award is net of Colombian taxes is not accepted as the

equivalent of evidence of payment.*”

(b) Respondent’s Position

Colombia has not made any submissions on this issue.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

In the absence of any submissions from Colombia, the Tribunal in principle accepts Eco
Oro’s submissions and holds that any award of damages will be expressly ordered to be net

of all applicable Colombian taxes.

WHETHER ECO ORO IS ENTITLED TO AN INDEMNITY IN RESPECT OF
REMEDIATION COSTS

(1) The Parties’ Positions
(a) Claimant’s Position

Eco Oro claims an indemnity in respect of remediation costs. Whilst Eco Oro renunciated
Concession 3452, this was not done voluntarily; it was compelled to do so because the ANM
arbitrarily refused to suspend its obligations under the Concession or extend the deadline for
submitting a PTO. The renunciation triggered a requirement under Colombian law to
undertake the remediation of the site of the Angostura Project. Whilst the costs are not yet

ing from Colombia’s breach of the FTA

 

known, these costs form part of Eco Oro’s losses ai

pursuant to the principle of full reparation.°*°

918.

919.

(b) Respondent’s Position

Colombia is not required to indemnify Eco Oro for the remediation costs. Colombia did not
compel Eco Oro to renounce Concession 3452, it renounced it voluntarily and it was this
intervening act (and its omission in failing to submit a PTO within the contractual time limit)
which caused the loss for which it seeks to hold Colombia liable. These costs would have
been payable in any event once the Concession was terminated, including if it had been
terminated upon successful completion of a mining exploitation project, pursuant to Articles

110 and 114 of the 2001 Mining Code and Clause 19 of the Concession Agreement.*”*

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal requests the Parties to address the following additional questions to assist it in

determining this issue:
a. What is the anticipated timetable for Eco Oro to undertake remediation work?

b. What is the likely nature of that remediation work?

IX. DECISION

920.

804

For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:
(1). The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims raised.

(2) By a majority, the Tribunal decides that Colombia is not in breach of Article 811 of
the FTA.

(3) By a majority, the Tribunal decides that Colombia is in breach of Article 805 of
the FTA.

(4) In this regard, given, as Eco Oro accepts, it has the burden of proof to make its case on
damages, Eco Oro is ordered to file its submissions responsive to the following

questions and Colombia is then to file its submissions in response, if any. To the extent

Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 496-498.

383/387

either the Parties agree or the Tribunal so orders, a second round of sequential reply

submissions will be permitted. The questions are as follows:

a. Are the losses suffered by Eco Oro for a breach of Article 805 and Article 811 the
same, and to be measured in the same way? If not, given the majority Tribunal’s

reasoning, what is the nature of the loss that Eco Oro has actually suffered, if any?

b. Should the expert evidence adduced by the Parties be revised, given the majority
Tribunal’s findings that Colombia is not in breach of Article 811 but is in breach of

Article 805? If so, how?

c. Given the Tribunal’s findings on the merits and given its analysis above with
respect to the inapplicability both of an income-based valuation methodology and
Colombia’s chosen comparable transactions, is Eco Oro’s proposed Comparable
Transactions methodology the one to be applied, or is there an alternative

methodology which should be considered given the nature of Eco Oro’s losses?

d. How can Eco Oro’s loss of opportunity to apply for an environmental licence to
allow exploitation be valued? On what basis is the quantum of that loss, if any, to

be assessed?

e. What is the probability that the Santurban Paramo overlaps with the Angostura

Deposit and to what extent?

f. What is the probability that Eco Oro would have been awarded an environmental

licence to allow exploitation in the following scenarios:

i. The Angostura Deposit is not within the boundaries of the paramo as

determined by the final delimitation;

ii. The Angostura Deposit is partially within the boundaries of the paramo as

determined by the final delimitation; or

iii. The Angostura Deposit is wholly within the boundaries of the paramo as

determined by the final delimitation.

384/387

(6)

n.

What is the effect on the identification of the loss suffered, and its valuation, if any,
if Eco Oro failed to establish that an exercise in due diligence had been carried out

prior to the decision to move to the development of an underground mine?
What is the correct valuation date for a breach of Article 805 of the FTA?

If there is a significant gap between the identified valuation date and the dates on
which the Comparable Transactions took place, what adjustment, if any, should be

made to the Comparable Transactions valuation?

What evidence, if any, is there on the record, in addition to Mr. Moseley-William’s
testimony that the area of Concession 3452 that does not lie within the current
delimitation cannot be ascribed a value, such that no deduction should be made in

the event that a fair market valuation is adopted to value Eco Oro’s loss?

What evidence is there to support Eco Oro’s assertion of the costs it has incurred

to date?

What is a commercially reasonable interest rate?

. What is the anticipated timetable for Eco Oro to undertake remediation work?

and

What is the likely nature of that remediation work?

The Parties are invited to confer and reach an agreement on the format and

timetable for the additional submissions requested by the Tribunal in this Decision and

to appraise the Tribunal of the terms of such an agreement by no later than

7 October 2021.

Upon receiving the Parties’ additional submissions, the Tribunal will render its award

on damages. Any award of damages will be expressly ordered to be net of all applicable

Colombian taxes. Colombia will be ordered not to tax or attempt to tax the award and

to indemnify Eco Oro in respect of any adverse consequences that may result from the

385/387

imposition of a double taxation liability by the Colombian tax authorities if the
declaration in the award recognising that the award is net of Colombian taxes is not

accepted as the equivalent of evidence of payment.

and

All other claims are dismissed.

Exhibit No.

 

“Naturally, exclusion areas need to be geographically delimited in a clear manner,
and this duty falls upon the environmental authority, in line with the provisions of
Article 5 of Law 99 of 1993. Moreover, it includes the mining authority's
collaboration in mining interest areas, which gives effect to the principle of prioritizing
the protection of our country's biodiversity along with sustainable utilization, in
accordance with the universal and sustainable development principles enshrined in the
Rio de Janeiro Declaration of June 1992, which has been ratified by Colombia.

The Court finds it necessary to point out that the mining authority has a duty to
collaborate with the environmental authority, but this collaboration duty does not,
however, operate as a limitation or condition on the exercise of the powers of the
environmental authority, which is the agency in charge of establishing exclusion zones;
it is for this reason that in the operative portion of this decision we will restrict the
constitutionality of Article 34(2) of Law 685 of 2001.” (p. 40)

stricter verification and compliance with the technical, legal and economic obligations
is required in order to maximize the use of the reserves with the least possible

Institute's Atlas to be used as a minimum reference, at no point does it determine that
such cartography established the areas excluded from mining

Finally, the position of the control organs in relation to the protection of natural
resources is clear to this Office. Thus, the precautionary principle constitutes one of
the fundamental tenets of Colombian environmental policy. However, such principle
cannot disregard acquired rights, in accordance with Article 58 of the Political

indicated therein is to be put into practice should be considered, with the elements
available t0 the mining authority and based on the criteria of reasonableness,

[Jd

Hence, and in response to the arguments put forward by the mining title holder in its
petition for reversal, it is necessary to examine the rationality and proportionality of
the decision contained in Resolution No. VSC-002, dated August 8, 2012, based on
the undeniable fact that, at present, Article 202 of Law No. 1450 of 2011 has not
been developed, so there is no map at a more detailed scale to provide the mining
authority with solid arguments to delimit with absolute certainty the paramo that the
resolution is intended to protect.

As a result, the decision in Resolution No. VSC-O02, dated August 8, 2012, must be
intended to protect both the collective right to the environment represented by the
preservation of the pdramo and the right of the holder of the mining title to preserve
an area whose legal status is uncertain, because it cannot be said with complete
certainty, due to the absence of technical parameters, that it is located within the
paramo.

However, the precautionary and prudent action that must be taken by the government
agency concerning collective rights cannot go so far as to threaten subjective rights.
Hence, the instruments provided for by the legal system have to be used to create
conditions to suspend rights so that, when an uncertain condition is satisfied, the right
is either granted or forfeited.

Accordingly, and in response to the arguments put forward by the holder of the mining
title in its petition for reversal filed under No. 2012-261-026565-2, it is clear that
the delimitation of the paramo ecosystem based on the map of the Alexander von
Humboldt Research Institute is temporary until the competent environmental authority
creates the final delimitation at a scale of 1:25,000 after carrying out the technical,
economic, social and environmental studies referred to in Article 202 of Law No. 1450
of 2011. For this reason, the mining authority determination must be in line with
said condition. Therefore, the mining authority considers it appropriate to adjust
Article 1 of Resolution No. VSC-002 of 2012 and, therefore, will modify it to extend
the exploration stage of mining concession agreement No. 3452 of 2007, suspending

 

exploration activities in the area overlapping with the pdramo, in accordance with the
delimitation based on the map in the Péramo Atlas of Colombia by the Alexander von
Humboldt Institute, until the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable
Development or the entity acting in its capacity issues the final delimitation of the
péramo area in accordance with Article 202 of Law No. 1450 of 2011. This will
serve to ensure the effective enforcement of the prohibition on mining activities in
paramo areas contained in Article 202 of Law No. 1450 of 2011.”

Brigitte LG Baptiste interview, Youtube: “Right, the question is what is the
problem that those potential solutions are trying to address. And who said we needed
mines? Who said we needed that gold? Who said we needed all that? For whom and
under what conditions? If there is a real problem justifying that, let's look for other
imaginary solutions that will serve as substitutes. Because, potentially, there is...
there have to be many roads we can take to live without the need to bleed Amazonas
dry, without the need to destroy a mountain, right? So, there is a very good exhibition
that opened today in Bogotd about gold in the péramos, with a humorous approach
to that apparent wealth. Now, if all Colombians swear time and again athat we need
mining to improve our quality of life, to purchase... to import more items, which is
what we're starting to do with the money that's coming, and foreign investment arrives
and we immediately go out and buy more TVs, import more consumer goods. If that's
the goal, then why ask if we really need to tear down péramos, deplete water reserves,

 

and make the situation worse, right? So we have to create imaginary solutions

following the principles... yada yada yada!”

Letter from Attorney General (Mr, Ordéjiez Maldonado) to MinAmbiente,
MinMinas and ANM:

“The above partly explains why as of this date the Colombian Mining Registry is not
up to date and organized: it is because of the delay in complying with the zoning and

regulation obligations required to clearly identify excluded areas. All this created an

 

uncertain legal environment that resulted in the discussion becoming ideolagical,
which made it seem in some respects that the development of an environmentally
responsible mining industry is incompatible with the conservation of the environment,
which criminalizes the activity, exaggerating its effects and creating suspicions about
any decision taken by the mining or environmental authorities.

In short, the Ministries and the ANM are hereby compelled to take appropriate action
in order to:

1. Coordinate efforts to comply with their obligations as established by law and the
Constitution;

2. Whenever possible and as mandated by the Political Constitution, settle existing
queries given that there are mining areas that had been granted to black and native
communities in some of the areas intended to be regulated;

3. Avoid ideologization of the debate and make decisions based on comprehensive
supporting studies;

4. Regularly share any progress made in the zoning and delimitation process for the
sake of transparency;

5. Recognize any consolidated situations and vested rights to prevent the filing of legal
claims against the Colombian state;

6. The National Mining Agency is required to proceed with caution to refrain from
rejecting proposals or terminating agreements if there are conditions — such as the
decisions made by the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development —
that may threaten citizens and companies that, relying on the principle of confianza

legitima, have approached the State to propose or develop mining concessions.”

Letter from Eco Oro (Mr. Linares Pedraza) to the Minister of Mines (Mr
Acosta Medina): “The changes that have taken place around the Angostura Project
are translated, among others, in that it is being led under a new philosophy and a new
strategic direction, nurtures itself from learning and knowledge of the experiences and
mistakes of the past. Equally behind this project are new investors with a more human
and environmental outlook; there is a new Board of Directors with the participation
of Colombians interested in marking the development of this country and a new team
mostly made up of Santandereans.

You, Minister, must be aware of the abysmal differences between the old Greystar open-
cast project from a technical and environmental point of view, and today's Eco [Oro]
underground project. But perhaps, we have not made a big enough effort you pick up
the feeling, the mood, the soul of those who day by day fight. Our company takes it

_from there and shapes, with realities, the dreams of thousands of families of the needy

province of Soto Norte.

Our identity is authentic and genuinely Colombian, and like you Dr. Amilkar, we are
proud of it: for no reason - not even for gold - would we be at the forefront of a project
that could undermine or jeopardise our land and our people.”

Sarmiento) and CDMB (Mr. Anaya Méndez): “Since the declaration of the
Santurbén Péramo Regional Natural Park (PNR), more than 1,300 direct jobs and
approximately 2,500 indirect jobs have been lost in the areas of Vetas, California,
Surata Matanza, Charta and Tona. This reduction in employment in the area has
resulted in a complicated situation for civil unrest and illegality that will likely be
aggravated if the delimitation of the Pdramo ecosystem covers an area larger than the
Park. This is because the communities of the Soto Norte region are not prepared to
allow their rights to be further affected; [...]. It is our duty to show that the Ministry
of Environment's decision on the delimitation of the Santurbén péramo ecosystem
should not ignore the acquired rights of mining titleholders of the Soto-Norte Region.
This results in a sensitive situation from a juridical and political perspective because
in the municipalities that make up the region, there are innumerable deposits of gold
and silver, over which there are many mining titles that were acquired from the
Constitution and the Law (some of which were granted under the terms of Law 2655
of 1988 and others under Law 685 of 2001), and registered in the National Mining
Registry; [...] If the real objective is to preserve the area adequately, to prevent the
proliferation of illegal mining and to avoid environmental disasters, displacement and
misery, as well as a rise in unemployment and legal uncertainty, the area of the
paramo should not be larger than the area of the park.”

“The solution to this problem lies in where the boundary will be located, but the most
important, complementary aspect is how to clearly guarantee that these people can

the solution this sector would propose to the problem of acquired rights, and Mr.
Rodriguez said that the solution was to revoke these. The Minister objected to extreme

“Running through the middle of what we see in this video, we would have the famous

called Tosca Borrero, through which the line would pass. Even so, everything we can
see in this video is supposed to be part of the paramo ecosystem. And right in front of
me, where there are authorized exploitation titles, the line could divide, if you will,
the area that is being exploited within the paramo from the area that is being exploited
below the paramo. However, if you look at the entire landscape, it's all the same, in

Letter from the MinAmbiente (Mr. Vallejo) to the Consejo de Estado (Mr
Hernandez): asking 7 questions:
“1. Does the prohibition under Article 202(1) of Law No. 1450 apply prospectively,
i.e. would it affect only legal or factual situations that had not already materialized
prior to the entry into force of the prohibitions contained in Law No. 1382 of 2010
and Law No. 1450 of 2011?
2. If the answer to the previous question is no, is the enforcing authority of such law
required to immediately order the closure of all prohibited activities? Would such order
result in potential liability for the State in relation to persons with an interest in legal
situations which have already materialized in the area delimited as a péramo
ecosystem?
3. If the answer to the first question is no, is the government allowed to request
compliance with such law in a gradual or progressive manner, in furtherance of the
principle of legitimate expectations?
4. Can the environmental authority, through zoning and the regime governing the
uses of the delimited paramo ecosystem, adopt environmental actions to progressively
and gradually allow the reconversion of prohibited activities in pdramo ecosystems,
even when such activities had materialized before the entry into force of Law No. 1450
of 20112
5. Is it possible to file an application for an environmental license with the
environmental authority in relation to mining titles that had been granted before the
entry into force of such prohibition and that did not apply for or obtain the relevant
environmental license authorizing the commencement of mining exploitation
Yo. 1450 of 2011 is in force,
allowed to authorize mining exploitation activities by granting an environmental

 

activities? Is the environmental authority, while Law

license for mining titles that were effective prior to the entry into force of the legal
prohibition under Law No. 1382 of 2010?
6. Pursuant to Article 202 of Law No. 1450, is the Ministry required to delimit the

 

ecosystem in line with the technical elements provided by natural sciences, taking into
account the social and economic information required to characterize the area?

7. Or is it required to define the ecosystem by combining the elements resulting from
natural sciences and the social and economic aspects of the area, which would involve
excluding ecosystems already transformed by human activities from the delimitation of
the péramo?”

decree are aimed at conducting activities in wetlands included in the list of wetlands

Afver failing to meet several deadlines, the Ministry of Environment is yet to publish
the delimitation’s coordinates, which, according to former minister Luz Helena
Sarmiento, have been ready since late 2013.

The Ministry of the Environment remains firm in its intention to focus on the social

ecosystems, Implementation of the prohibition contained in Act 1450 of

 

2011. Prevalence of the general interest and implementation of the nece:

 

sary

measures for its effectiveness”: “c. Those contracts executed prior to Act 1382 of
2010 that pose a risk to the paramo ecosystems which cannot be neutralized through
existing environmental instruments cannot continue, and the general interest of
environmental protection must take precedence over the private interests of the mining
concession-holder. In these events, the need to reach agreements for economic

compensation so as to avoid legal claims must be reviewed on a cae b-ca basis.”

 

This Advisoy Opinion contains s
“the conflce betneen private propery and the general interest is resolved under the
Constitution in the latter's favor, but on condition of the prior payment of

cral noteworthy pass

 

compensation, which acts as compensation or subrogation for the right of which its
holder has been deprived. In this way, property is not disregarded but, it is precisely
its recognition that determines its transformation into a credit claim against the
expropriating public entity, for the value of the compensation

Thus, since the sacrifice of individual and established situations does not constitute
the general rule of State action and entails a clear afflictive effect on citizens, their
legal position is surrounded by a series of minimum guarantees such as (i) strict
adherence to the principle of legality (compliance with constitutional requirements);
(ii) observance of due process and (ili) payment of compensation to prevent the
Administration's decision from becoming ‘a confiscatory act, expressly prohibited by
Article 34 of the Constitution.

 

“Thus, in cases such as the one analyzed, the protection of pdramo ecosystems for the
enefi of the entire community, and even for global environmental sustainability,
must also take into account the situation of the people who legally inhabit or exploit
these territories, in order to avoid, as far as possible the unnecessary creation of
situations of state liability through the implementation of the prohibition analyzed.

“it is constitutionally problematic for citizens to be exposed to sudden changes in
regulations, which affect validly formed economic and life expectations based on
existing regulations (even more so when they have been promoted, authorized or
tolerated by the State itself), without there being any legal periods or mechanisms of
transition or compensation, as the case may be. Consequently, the solutions to the
questions raised must consider how to render these constitutional requirements
compatible with the purposes of the legal prohibition analyzed.”

Vetas municipality. It was originally granted in the 1950s and more than two
generations of locals have legally worked under that title. The title is held by 14
residents of Vetas and it generates over 60 direct jobs. There is an environmental
control instrument (PMA) and a current concession agreement. 100% of this title has
been affected: 78.1% is covered by the preservation area (green) and 21.9% by the
restoration or potential péramo area (yellow). In light of everything that this title
represents for the past, present, and future of Vetas and considering that its holders
are local residents of our municipality, we request a review and analysis of the extent
of its overlap with the paramo and that it be excluded from the green arca.”

Letter from ANM to Eco Oro: “The Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable
Development has recently sent the National Mining Agency the submitted zones
corresponding to the reference areas for the pdramo ecosystems declared and delineated
in the country, which have been incorporated into the Colombian Mining Registry
(CMC).

In furtherance of the Mining Cadaster and Registry's duty to manage and update the
information contained in the national mining cadaster, the National Mining Agency,
under Decree No. 4134 of 201 1, has found that the mining concession contract under
Law No. 685 of 2001, identified with number EJ1-163, of which you are the holder,
overlaps 49.45% of a Preservation Zone, as per the delimitation of the Ministry of
the Environment and Sustainable Development of PZ- JURISDICTIONS-
SANTURBAN-BERLIN.

In addition, it should be borne in mind that, under Article 173 of Law No. 1753 of
2015, establishing the 2014-2018 National Development Plan, ‘All for a New
Country’, ‘No person may engage in agricultural activities, exploration or
exploitation of non-renewable natural resources or construction of hydrocarbon
refineries in the areas delimited as paramos.’ As a consequence, no mining activities
may be conducted in these areas.

Likewise, it should also be taken into account that the Constitutional Court, when
discussing such article, in judgment C-035 of 2016, ruled as follows:

However, the question to be resolved by the Court is whether it is reasonable to permit
mining and hydrocarbon activities temporarily in areas of special constitutional

protection when there is a deficit of legal protection, and the provision whereby such
activities are allowed does not provide for any real protection guarantee.

In the Court's view, the answer to the question asked above should be ‘no’. Sacrificing
legally protected interests, such as water quality, continuity and accessibility, and the
other environmental services provided by paramos is disproportionate to the potential
benefits that may derive fiom the extraction of non-renewable resources. With paramos
being such a vulnerable and fragile ecosystem, endowed with little adaptation
capacity, the impacts thereon are long term, if not permanent.

In addition, it is noteworthy for your mining project that Article 36 of Law No. 685
of 2001 provides as follows

In concession contracts, the areas, plots of land and courses where, pursuant to the
above articles, mining activities are prohibited shall be deemed excluded or restricted
by operation of law or conditioned by the granting of special permits or authorizations.
This exclusion or restriction need not be declared by any authority whatsoever, or be
expressly stated in acts and agreements, nor may be subject to any waiver by the bidder
or concessionaire of such areas or plots of land (...)

The above is set out for your information and relevant purposes.”

As a result, it follows from the maps provided by the abovenamed Ministry that

which mining activities of any kind are prohibited, in conformity with official
communication No. 2016220182461 submitted on May 19, 2016, by the Head

ANM Technical Report No. VSC 169: “4.1 Considering that this mining project
is currently in the ninth year of the exploration phase, it is concluded that the ‘Mining
and Environmental Policy’ submitted has been executed in accordance with the criteria
set forth in Section 12 of Concession Agreement No. 3452. The term of duration of
this policy is from August 8, 2015 to August 8, 2016, thus, the project is currently
in the ninth (9) year of exploration insured by the policy.

As regards the ‘Surface Canon’ paid by ‘Eco Oro Minerals Corp. Colombia Branch’,
amounting to $37,952,451 for the ninth year of exploration, it is considered correct
and in accordance with the criteria set forth in Concession Agreement No, 3452 and
Article 27 of Law No. 1753 of 2005.

Due to the foregoing, the concession holder under agreement No. 3452, ECO ORO

4.2 It is recommended that the request for extension of th

 

sxploration phase submitted
by the concession-holder under agreement No. 3452, Eco Oro Minerals Corp.
Colombia Branch be approved, as it is considered technically feasible and in
compliance with the provisions of the current regulations: Law No. 1450/2011,
Implementing Executive Order No. 943/2013, Executive Order No. 1073/2015,
Law No. 1753/2015. However, Constitutional Court Judgment No. C-035 of
February 8, 2016 on paramos should also be considered. Such judgment is aimed at
protecting areas of special ecological significance, such as pdramos, since these have a
major role in the regulation of drinking water in our country, are places of
groundwater recharge and of great vulnerability to any intervention.

In view of the foregoing and, the holdings of Constitutional Court Judgment No. C-
035 of February 8, 2016 and of case law on paramos, the exploration phase should
be continued within the drea of mining title 3452 that is outside the area delimited
as the Santurbén pdramo zone, péramo restoration zone and outside the Santurbén
Regional Natural Park.

Finally, a detailed schedule of the exploration activities to be conducted on a monthly
basis for the two years of extension, stating specific dates, is required in order to allow

for the future supervision and control of such activities and verification of performance

thereof

seriously question its viability.

In this sense, this document is intended to describe the activities to be carried out during

developing the Angostura Project, considering the new measure adopted.

We clarify that submission of this present proposal of works does not suppose nor can

invest in emerging market projects that will drive development and job creation within
our country partners.

Given recent developments in Colombia, and in particular, the ANM’s recent
withdrawal of a significant portion of the mining title upon which the Project depends,
we take the view that the Project is unlikely to be developed further. As you will
appreciate, IFC continues to seek opportunities to reinvest our funds into other projects
that fulfill our investment policy goals.

“Soto Norte (Minesa) and Angostura (Eco Oro)

As regards illegal mining, different strategies are being implemented, given that in the
case of Angostura illegal miners are operating inside the paramo area Illegal miners
are permanently intruding in the mines left by Eco Oro in order to exploit them. Inter-
institutional roundtables have been established with formal companies in order to
adjust their PTO. In any event, illegal mining activities in the pdramo area require
more decisive planning based on the CONPES (Colombian Council of Economic and
Social Policy). Coordination with the National Planning Department (DNP) and the
Ministries of Environment, of Mines and Energy and of Defense shall be progressed in
order to define a schedule and action plans regarding any péramos to be delimited in
the future.

[REDACTED TEXT]

As regards security issues, the Ministry of Defense has requested that the companies
strengthen their private security. Furthermore, it was noted that the Ministry of Mines
and Energy and the Governor's Office are working on a productive change program
which will include 5,000 people in Vetas and 2,000 people in California

As regards the delimitation process in the Santurbén péramo, the current legal status
was described: the Constitutional Court is currently reviewing the tutela action filed
against Resolution No. 2090 of 2014, through which the Santurbdn-Berlin paramo
was delimited.

Letter from Eco Oro (Mr. Moseley-Williams) to CDMB (Mr. Carvajal):
“Firstly, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for making time in your schedule
and meeting me and some of the members of the board of directors on November 21
The opportunity to exchange opinions and to understand the CDMB's stance with
regard to certain key matters for the Company is highly important, as it represents an
important input for the development of our business affairs.

As you are aware, Eco Oro has worked hard for several years to make Project Angostura
a reality, envisioning it as an example of sustainable development, good environmental
practices, regional development and job creation.

In this regard, we share your concern with respect to the lack of a decision by the
Constitutional Court regarding the action for the protection of constitutional rights
requested from the Court against Resolution 2090 of 2014, to finally clarify the
regulations applicable to the project. Without this decision, the CDMB will be unable
to process and grant an environmental license for the development of the Angostura
Project, as you stated during the meeting.

Finally, we would like to reiterate that the Company, in the context of its commitment
to the protection and conservation of the environment, wishes to make a contribution
to the CDMB by donating four (4) weather stations, hoping to contribute to a deeper
Inowledge of the environmental and weather conditions of the conservation areas
within the jurisdiction of the Authority. Eco Oro's team looks forward to coordinating
with your delegates to complete the donation.”

seeking suspension of its obligations under Concession Contract 3452:
“In December 2014, the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development,
through Resolution No. 2090, set the limits ofthe Santurbén Paramo. The Resolution
divided the péramo into three zones: i) the preservation zone; (ii) the restoration zone
and, iti) the sustainable use zone. The same resolution made some exceptions to the
general prohibition to carry out mining operations in the area. Among other
exceptions, the Resolution stipulated that mining operations could be authorized and
executed in the restoration zones of the péramo located in the municipalities of Vetas,
California and Suraté (where Concession 3452 is located). Additionally, and
generally, the Resolution provided that those projects with a mining concession
contract and with an environmental control and management instrument could
continue with the operations despite being located in a paramo. These exceptions would
be consistent with the rules of legal certainty set out in the Mining Code. Afterwards,
through Resolution VSC No. 00003, the National Mining Agency (ANM, on January
6, 2015, lified the suspension of operations under title 3452. Some months afier, on

 

June 2015, Law 1753 was enacted, which included exceptions similar to the ones of
Resolution No. 2090. Even if the scope of certain exceptions was still to be determined,
these regulations would allow Eco Oro to continue with the development of its
Angostura Project.

However, on February 8, 2016, the Constitutional Court issued judgment C-035/16,
whereby the provisions of Law 1753 of 2015 that established exceptions to the general
prohibition to perform mining operations in the pdramo, including the exceptions that
represented the ones included in Resolution No. 2090 (mentioned in the above
paragraph) and which applied to Eco Oro, were declared unconstitutional. In
addition, judgment C-035/ 16 limited he powers of the Ministry of the Environment
and Sustainable Development to demarcate the pdramos. Even though Judgment C-
035/16 has no direct impact on Resolution No. 2090, due to its importance, and
because there is a pending tutela action before the Constitutional Court against said
resolution, the demarcation of the Santurbdn Paramo became uncertain. This had a
direct impact on the possibility of developing activities under Concession 3.452.

Next, and based on Judgment C-035/16, the ANM issued Resolution No. VSC 829
on August 2, 2016, whereby the exploration stage of Concession Contract 3452 was
extended for two years, but “exclusively concerning the area that does not overlap with
the pdramo preservation zone.” Likewise, the ANM decided that, given that Agreement
3452 has ‘50.73% of its area partially overlapping with the pdramo preservation
zone" Eco Oro should only pay surface canons ‘for the area that does not overlap, on
the understanding that the rest is excluded by operation of the law.

This means that, as a result of Judgment C-035/16 and ANM Resolution No. VSC
829, Eco Oro lost the right to perform mining operations on most of the land under
Concession 3452 and to access the existing mineral resources, which deprives Eco Oro
of its rights.

The ANM subsequently limited to an even greater extent the possibility of developing
the Angostura Project, by creating a situation of uncertainty with respect to the Eco
Oro's rights under Contract 3452.

In this sense, on 7 April 2016, the ANM issued Resolution GSC-ZN 000048, of
which Eco Oro was notified on 20 September 2016, and in which it accepted the
extension request for the exploration phase that Eco Oro had filed in relation to

another of Eco Oro’s concession contracts, title EJ1-159. According to this resolution,
within title EJ1-159, as well as being prohibited in the ‘preservation’ area of the
Santurbén Péramo, mining was prohibited in the ‘restoration’ area of the Santurbén
Paramo, as well as in the Santurbén Regional Natural Park. If this same criterion is
applied to title 3452, it would reduce the area of Concession 3452 in which Eco Our
can carty out mining activities by a further 10%, This would even further reduce the
resources available in Concession 3452. In light of this, on 4 October 2016, Eco Oro

filed before the ANM an appeal against Resolution GSC-ZN 000048, requesting

clarification of the scope of these contradictory decisions. To date, no response has been
received from the ANM.

Moreover, to date, no guidelines have been established, or any zoning carried out, nor
has there been any determination of the activities permitted within the Santurbén-
Berlin Paramo, and it is not known what type of actions or measures will be taken in
order to do so. The lack of clarity and legal certainty regarding the activities that Eco
Oro can carry out within the boundaries of Concession 3452 makes it difficult, if not
impossible, to advance the development of a mining project.

Moreover, as mentioned above, a pending tutela action is currently underway against
Resolution 2090 before the Constitutional Court, which, in light of the precedent set
by Judgment C-35, could modify the application of Resolution 2090 or even deprive
the Resolution of effect and order the cessation of mining exploration and exploitation
activities being carried out in the Santurbdn Paramo while it is re-delimited.

As a consequence of the legal uncertainty affecting Contract 3452, the CDMB (the
environmental authority responsible for licensing the Angostura Project) has recently
informed Eco Oro that, given the lack of clarity regarding the regulatory framework
applicable to the Angostura Project, it is not in a position to process or grant an
environmental license requested by Eco Oro so that the Angostura project can progress
to the construction and mounting and, subsequently, exploitation phases, until the
litigation currently on foot is resolved. Additionally, if Resolution 2090 is lefé without
legal effect, it will not be possible for the Angostura Project to obtain an environmental
license since it will first be necessary for the entire process of delimiting and zoning
the Paramo to take place before mining activities can be authorized in the area where
the Angostura Project is located.

Mining Concession Contract 3452 is currently in the tenth year of exploration work.
The last extension of this phase granted by the ANM will expire on 8 August 2018.
Eco Oro will not be able to continue developing the Angostura Project if it is not
possible to obtain an environmental license prior to the expiry of the exploration phase.
For this reason, faced with the current unviability of the Angostura Project for the
reasons previously described, including the lack of legal clarity and security, it is not
sustainable for Eco Oro to continue carrying out activities and making investments in
the title, These circumstances constitute a force majeure or unforeseeable circumstances
[caso fortuito] event.”

they are the main matting that protects and allows the distribution of water in our
country. We are lucky to have around 50% of all the paramos in the world here in
Colombia. This is why the Administrative Prosecutor's Office, through the head of
environmental matters, adopted several measures to protect these ecosystems.

[...] Ako, recently, we requested fiom the National Mining Agency the exclusion of
all protected areas, particularly pdramos, and that all works and activities conducted

by concessionaires be immediately suspended and abandoned without compensation, as
mandated by Article 36 of the current Mining Code.

And regarding the Santurbén paramo, in light of the Constitutional Court's decision,
wwe are following up on the discussions held with the Ministry of the Environment and,
of course, we are working towards the pdramo's delimitation before the end of the
current administration.” Question: “What do you mean by ‘abandoned'?”

Answer: “I mean that, sometimes, mining areas overlap with protected areas because
titles were granted on protected areas where mining cannot be conducted. So, pursuant
to the applicable regulations, the Administrative Prosecutor's Office has insisted on
this because there are several titles currently in force that overlap with areas where
mining is prohibited.”

Letter from Eco Oro (Mr. Orduz) to the MinMinas (Ms, Suarez): “ECO ORO

Jiled its renunciation of Concession Contract No. 3452 (“Concession 3452")

with the National Mining Agency (“ANM’); “certain measures adopted by the
M, have rendered ECO ORO's Angostura
Project in Concession 3-432 unviable and left ECO ORO with no choice but to renounce

 

Colombian government, particularly the /

Concession 3452 in order to mitigate its losses:

1. In December 2014, Resolution No. 2090 of the Ministry of Environment and
Sustainable Development (“Resolution 2090") delimited the Santurbén Péramo,
which partially overlapped with the area of Concession 3452. Resolution 2090
contained certain exceptions to the general prohibition on conducting mining activities
in the péramo areas, including that mining projects which had a concession contract
and an environmental control and management instrument granted before February
2010—as was the case with Concession 3452—could continue to operate until the
termination of the Concession, notwithstanding the fact of overlapping with the
demarcated péramo area. In June 2015, Law No. 1753 was enacted, which ratified
the exception to the general prohibition on mining activities contained in Resolution
2090 for mining concessions with environmental control and management instruments
granted before February 2010. Based on those rules, ECO ORO could continue to
develop the Angostura Project.

2. However, on 2 August 2016, the ANA issued Resolution VSC 829 (“Resolution
VSC 829"), which extended the exploration phase of Concession Contract 3452 for a

final term of two years, but restricted that extension to “the area [of Concession 3452]

that does not overlap with the paramo preservation area [set out in Resolution 2090].
The ANM based this decision on Constitutional Court Ruling No. C-035/16 of 8
February 2016, which struck down the exception to the ban on mining in paramo
areas for concessions with environmental instruments granted before 2010, as
stipulated in Law No, 1753. The ANM stated that, inasmuch as Concession 3452

 

C-423

 

32/36

 

 

Date

Exhibit No.

 

 

filed with the A

 

“presents a partial overlap of 50.73% with the paramo preservation area,” the
extension of the exploration phase of Concession 3452 would only apply to the
remaining areas of the Concession,

3. Upon the issuance of Resolution VSC 829, ECO ORO was deprived of its rights to
conduct mining activities in most of the area of Concession 3452 and to access the
mineral resources in that area, despite having invested more than two hundred and

fifty million dollars in the Concession area on the basis of those rights. The Company's

inability to access these resources rendered the Angostura Project economically
unviable. Moreover, it was still not clear whether ECO ORO would be able to develop
the remaining Concession areas located outside the pdramo preservation area, as
defined in Resolution 2090, in light of: (i) the inconsistent stance adopted by the
Al

zone set out in Resolution 2090; and (ii) the likelihood that the Constitutional Court

  

‘M regarding the possibility of accessing the areas inside the pdramo restoration
g ig the Pr y 9 P

would declare Resolution 2090 unenforceable within the context of a pending action

for the protection of constitutional rights (tutela) (which was strong at the time, based

on the Constitutional Court's criticism of the delimitation in Ruling No. C-035/ 16)
4. In fact, in November 2016, the CDMB, which was the regional environmental
authority competent to issue licenses for ECO ORO’s Angostura Project, informed the
Company that, as a result of the legal uncertainty surrounding ECO ORO’s right to
conduct mining activities in the remaining areas of Concession 3452, and particularly
in light of the tutela action against Resolution 2090 which was pending at the time,
no environmental license request could be processed for any project located within
Concession 3452

5. Against this backdrop, ECO ORO commenced an arbitration against the Republic
of Colombia under the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of
Colombia in order to seek compensation for the destruction of the value of its
investments in Concession 3452 and the Angostura Project. Consistent with its
obligations under international law, ECO ORO adopted measures to preserve the status
quo with respect to Concession 3452 so as to protect all available options to mitigate
its losses.

6. Consequently, on 7 March 2017, ECO ORO requested the suspension of the
obligations deriving from Concession Contract No, 3452 through letter No. 123346,
(M under No. 2017904005542. Such suspension would have
suspended the deadline for completing the exploration phase of Concession No. 3452

  

until the legal uncertainties regarding the ultimate location of the péramo were
clarified. In that letter, ECO ORO pointed out that:

‘[GJiven the current unviability of the Angostura Project for the reasons outlined
above, including the lack of clarity and legal certainty, it is not sustainable for Eco
Oro to continue carrying out activities and making investments in the title. These
circumstances constitute a force majeure event or an act of God."

7. In the following months, other Colombian Government acts exacerbated the
uncertainty surrounding Concession 3452 and affected ECO ORO's rights under its
concession

7.1. First, on 22 August 2017, the ANM rejected ECO ORO's suspension request
through Resolution VSC }

 

. 000906, stating that there were no impediments to
completing mine planning on Concession 3452. It was irrational to demand that ECO
ORO continue investing in mine development in an area wl

 

xe there was no certainty
that mining activities would be permitted in the future. Thus, on 29 September 2017,
by means of Letter No. 123478, ECO ORO filed an administrative challenge [recurso
de reposicidn] to the ANM's decision and requested that a suspension of its obligations
be granted.

7.2. Second, on 13 October 2017, the ANM issued Order No. 00195 approving the
Construction and Works Plan (Plan de Trabajo y Obras, PTO) of Sociedad Minera de
Santander $.A.S. (‘Minesa’), the owner of Concession 0095-68 which is an enclave
within Concession 3452. Minesa's PTO contemplated the construction of key

infrastructure, specifically twin tunnels, through areas of Concession 3452 called
“Agua Limpia” and “La Ollada” (two areas of Concession 3452 located outside the
péramo preservation area delimited by Resolution 2090, for which no mineral
resources have been declared). Minesa had not asked for ECO ORO’s consent to use
these areas of Concession 3452, granted exclusively to ECO ORO by acquiring and
paying for the rights to those areas, as it was required to do as a matter of Colombian
law.. ECO ORO therefore challenged the ANM’s approval of Minesa’s PTO on the
basis that it provided for the construction of infrastructure inside Concession 3452
without ECO ORO’s consent, which constituted an additional infringement of ECO
ORO’s rights under Concession 3452.

7.3. Third, in November 2017, the Constitutional Court rendered Decision No. T-
361/17, leaving Resolution 2090 without effect inasmuch as the delimitation of the
Santurbén Paramo had been conducted in breach of the applicable public consultation

 

requirements. The Court postponed for a year—until November 2018—the
annulment of Resolution 2090 in order to allow the Colombian Government to carry
out the required consultation process and issue a new delimitation. The Constitutional
Court stated that the new delimitation could only provide greater, not lesser,
protection to the Santurbén Péramo. This cast doubt as to whether any areas of
Concession 3452 would remain available for mining activities if the péramo
delimitation was expanded. Following the issuance of the Constitutional Court's
decision, the Ministry of the Environment announced a moratorium on permitting for
projects in the area for this very reason

The November 2018 deadline set by the Constitutional Court to issue the new (and
broader) delimitation of the Santurbén paramo was five months after the 21 June
2018 deadline for ECO ORO to submit a PTO and complete the permitting process

_for Concession 3452 (a term that the ANM refused to suspend). In other words, ECO

ORO would not know whether any areas of Concession 3452 would remain available

for mining activities until five months after its deadline to complete mine planning

and permitting pursuant to its obligations under the concession.

7.4. Fourth, on 21 March 2018, the ANM issued ORDER VSC 048 dismissing ECO
ORO’s administrative challenge [recurso de reposicién] against the approval of
Minesa’s PTO. The ANM’s decision allows Minesa to build its mining project’s
essential infrastructure inside Concession 3452, even though those areas were granted
to ECO ORO and Minesa has not paid for use of these rights.

However, Minesa agreed to acquire other mining titles belonging to ECO ORO that
were not affected by the uncertainty linked to the delimitation of the Santurbn
péramo—mining titles that it needed to carry out its own mining project.

7.5. Fifth, on 3 May 2018, ECO ORO was notified of ANM Resolution VSC 000343
of 16 April 2018, dismissing ECO ORO’s appeal against the ANM’s refusal to suspend
the Company's obligations under Concession 3452. As a result, the expiry date for the
Concession’s exploration n phase was upheld and, thus, ECO ORO still had to comply
with its obligation to submit a PTO and complete the permitting procedures for
Concession 3452 before 21 June 2018.

8. Consequently, on 21 June 2018, ECO ORO informed the ANM through letter No.
123872 that, in view of the uncertainty regarding the location in which mining
activities would be allowed (if anywhere at all)['] following the new delimitation of
the Santurbén péramo, ECO ORO would be unable to comply with its obligation to
submit a PTO and complete the permitting procedure before the deadline of 21 June
2018, or even before 8 August 2018, the date on which the exploration phase of
Concession 3452 would expire.

[1] 1 As explained by ECO ORO to the ANM in its letter of June 21, 2018, “[u]nder
Article 84 of the Mining Code, the PTO must identify, among other things, the
‘definitive delimitation of the mining area," the ‘location [...] of the reserves to be
exploited,’ and the ‘location of the infrastructure and works, mineral deposits,
treatment plant and transport, and, if required, processing facilities.’ Thus, for ECO

ORO to be able to submit a PTO, it needs to clearly understand in which areas of
Concession 3452 it will be able to conduct mining activities.”

9. The ANM replied to ECO ORO's letter on 5 July 2018, pointing out the following:
“given that [...] Eco Oro indicates that it is not possible for it to fulfil its obligation
of presenting a PTO [...] we understand that ultimately you would require an
additional term for fulfilling your obligation, and this being the case, it is appropriate

_for the title-holder to file a formal request for an extension [...]."

10, Although it noted that it was not aware of any legal grounds for requesting an
extension of the Concession’s exploration phase (besides the suspension of its
obligations), ECO ORO accepted the ANM’s proposal and on 30 July 2018, by means
of letter No. 122912, ECO ORO requested that the ANM extend the Concession’s
exploration phase until afier the Ministry of Environment issued the new delimitation
of the Santurbén Paramo (the deadline for this being 30 November 2018).

11, Shortly afterwards, ECO ORO filed a request for pre-judicial conciliation with
the ANM (and Minesa) regarding the ANM’s decision to approve Minesa’s PTO, in a

final effort to have the decision revoked.

12. On 30 August 2018, through letter No. 20183500273331, the ANM decided
to grant ECO ORO an extension until 30 November 2018, the same deadline as that
established by the Constitutional Court for the new delimitation of the Santurbén
Paéramo. However, in October 2018, a Colombian court granted the Ministry of
Environment an extension until 15 July 2019 to complete the public consultations
required under Constitutional Court ruling No. T-361/17 and publish the new
delimitation of the Santurbén Péramo.

13. When ECO ORO requested, through letter No. 124065 of 23 November 2018,
that the ANM grant an equivalent extension for the expiry of its Concession, the ANM
rojected that request by means of letter No. 2019300267141 of 21 December 2018.
In its decision, the ANM averred that ECO ORO faced no “technical or legal
impediments” in preparing a PTO, which it knew to be false. The ANM’s decision
contradicts its previous decision to grant an extension until afier the original deadline
set by the Constitutional Court for the new delimitation of the Santurbén Péramo.
14. By December 2018, the conciliation relating to the approval of Minesa’s PTO
had failed

15, Although the Ministry of Environment has yet to publish the new coordinates for
the Santurbén Péramo, on 14 February 2019, the ANM issued Order VSC O41
instructing ECO ORO to submit a PTO for Concession 3452 within the following 30
days.

As a result, at present, the exploration phase of Concession 3452 has formally ended
and thus ECO ORO has no choice but to formally renounce the Concession in order to
mitigate its losses and thus, among other things, (a) avoid the continuing costs related
to the mine's maintenance and safety; and (b) avoid a declaration of caducity that
could impede the conclusion of the sale and transfer of certain mining titles by ECO
ORO to Minesa.”

Partial Dissenting Opinion

1. For the reasons that follow, based on the specific facts and applicable law in the present
case, and despite certain coincidences in the legal analysis and facts considered in the
decision and in this dissenting opinion in respect of or in connection with the indirect
expropriation claim, I find myself unable to share the conclusions in the decision in regard
to this claim.

2. Also, although I am in agreement with the decision’s final adjudication of the Claimant’s
fair and equitable claim, I do not agree — as it should become apparent from a comparison
of this dissenting opinion with the decision — with each and every finding, understanding
of the evidence or analysis leading to such decision.

3. Annex 811 (2)(b) of the Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement (the “Treaty”) is to be
read against the backdrop of general international law for its understanding and
interpretation. As set forth in the Phoenix award, the parties to a treaty cannot contract out
of the system of international law. As soon as States contract with one another, they do so
automatically and necessarily within the system of international law,' which brings into
the picture general principles of law and international law doctrines.” Therefore, when
construed or interpreted, this Treaty provisions cannot be isolated from general
international law.

4. Annex 811 (2)(b) refers to “rare circumstances” and includes as illustration of situations
in which “rare circumstances” would be present, “when a measure or series of measures
is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been
adopted in good faith [or of a] non-discriminatory [character]”.° If rare circumstances are
present under international law, a finding of indirect expropriation may follow.

5. “Rare circumstances” afford large leeway for interpretation. In the corresponding
interpretative exercise, the legal factors to be considered from an international law
perspective include legitimate expectations created when the concession was executed on
8 February 2007 (the “Concession”)* in respect of legal title/Concession rights of the

' Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award (15 April 2009), at para. 77.

into force on 15 August 2011) (Exhibit C-22; see also Exhibit R-137).

Claimant, general public international law principles of pacta sunt servanda, good faith
(including legitimate expectations and the condemnation of abuse of rights) and the
proportionality principle. Indeed, although good faith — a general principle of customary
international law — encompasses all the latter which, in turn, contribute to shaping the
notion of good faith and its substance, pacta sunt servanda is a general, stand-alone
principle of customary international law.

The above is apposite in connection with contractual agreements like the Concession.
Contractual rights thereunder are protected investments under the definition of investment
in Article 838(g)(i), Section “C” of the Treaty, which expressly includes concessions.
Contractual rights covered by this provision (unlike other situations which might also fall
within its purview) are particularly apt to generate legitimate expectations frustrated by the
retroactive or retrospective application of laws, including, without limitation,
environmental laws, insofar as not accompanied by full compensation or a credible offer
to fully compensate. Indeed, under Treaty Article 811(1)(c), lack of compensation as
defined in the Treaty constitutes a Treaty breach rendering the taking illicit under
international law.

The validity of the Concession under Colombian law has not been challenged, so that the
necessary conclusion is that the Concession was made with the concessionaire having the
legitimate expectation that its rights thereunder would be respected including, without
limitation, its right to make a profit or draw economic benefit. The frustration of such rights
resulting from retroactive or retrospective legislation or regulations must necessarily be
taken into account to determine if Treaty guarantees have been violated, including in the
analysis whether “rare circumstances” are present. As it will be further discussed below, a
valid concession under Colombian law vests the concessionaire with acquired rights to
explore and exploit the mining resource within the boundaries of the Concession
as granted.

Further, the protection of legitimate expectations is intimately intertwined with customary
international law rules, of substantial relevance when there is uncertainty in the applicable
legal regime introduced through State conduct after the granting of contractual rights under
a transaction to which the State is a party.

As the European Court of Human Rights* has decided, not only the protection of legitimate
expectations is a component of the general good faith rule of customary international law
but, indeed, such rule is a corollary of the protection of legitimate expectations as a
general principle of law® indissolubly linked to the good faith rule under customary
international law.

5 Opel Austria GmbH v. Council of the European Union, Case T-115/94 (Judgment of the Court of First Instance
(Fourth Chamber) (22 January 1997) ECR II-00039.

© See, for example, Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/01, Award
(22 September 2014) (Exhibit RL-96) at para. 576 showing that the protection of legitimate expectations is a general
principle of law. The International Court of Justice has not endorsed the existence of an international law principle
protecting legitimate expectations (Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia vs Chile) October
2018 Judgment ICJ Report 2018 page 507, at page 559 (para. 162). However, the facts giving rise to this decision

2

“The principle of good faith, codified by Article 18 of the First Vienna
Convention, is a rule of customary international law whose existence is
recognized by the International Court of Justice and is therefore binding on
the Community. The principle is the corollary in public international law of
the principle of protection of legitimate expectations, which forms part of
the Community legal order and on which an economic operator to whom an

institution has given justified hopes may rely”."

10. Although this case concerned the application in time of a provision of the EC Agreement,
it stands for a general principle of customary international law which is clearly relevant
when acquired rights are exposed to the retroactive application of legal rules, therefore
adversely affecting legal certainty and predictability and concomitant expectations
associated with them. In this connection, the following excerpt of this decision is pertinent:

“The principle of legal certainty requires Community legislation to be
certain and its application foreseeable by individuals and that every
Community measure having legal effects must be clear and precise and
must be brought to the notice of the person concerned in such a way that he
can ascertain exactly the time at which the measure comes into being and
starts to have legal effects. That requirement must be observed all the more
strictly in the case of a measure liable to have financial consequences in
order that those concerned may know precisely the extent of the obligations
which it imposes on them”®.

11. To consider, in light of the above, whether “rare circumstances” in face of which, for
example, not respecting a concessionaire’s rights under a concession would lead to the
violation of Treaty Article 811(1) and its Annex 811(2)(b), it is necessary to bear in mind
that normal circumstances require not applying retroactively laws or regulations interfering
with contractual rights and defeating acquired rights or expectations associated with such
rights. It cannot be “normal” to take for granted the retroactive application of the law or
legal regulations to defeat concession rights, which are prospective in nature, particularly
when such application is pursued by the State party to the contract to the detriment of the
private counterpart in a situation like the one at stake, in which the State played an active
role in attracting investments through, inter alia, the enticement of a concession based on
the agreement between the State and a private party the legal regime of which is unilaterally
controlled by the State. In such scenario, if such interference happens, a “rare
circumstance” is engendered, and compensation may be appropriate.

concerned the existence or not of the obligation to negotiate maritime boundaries in an inter-State dispute, and not the
enforcement of concession rights protected by a bilateral investment protection treaty. Further, the Court explicitly
recognized that the legitimate expectations principle was applied in treaty investment disputes.

12. Colombian law leads to similar conclusions. Under Colombian law, including Colombian
constitutional law, the retroactive (affecting acquired rights, Colombian Constitution
Article 58) or retrospective (affecting ongoing relationships) application of national law
requires compensation. Although this provision privileges the public interest over merely
private ones, it does provide for compensation in case of deprivation of property rights. In
this respect, not only does Article 58 preclude the retroactive application of the law as a
basic constitutional guarantee, but it also provides that acquired rights are part of the
property rights protected by this provision, which in the present case come into life
simultaneously with the coming into life of the contract or concession constituting their
source’. In turn, the notion of acquired rights unequivocally carries with it the principle
that acquired rights may not be eroded or suppressed by a retroactive application of the law
without compensating for the deprivation of such rights protected by the Colombian
Constitution.

13. Also, the Colombian law principle of “confianza legitima’” (“legitimate expectation or
reliance”) comes into the picture. The retroactive application of the law to the detriment of
acquired rights under Colombian law would be a still more blatant violation both of the
legitimate expectations principle under international law and the confianza legitima and
acquired rights principles under Colombian law. It should be noted that under Colombian
constitutional law, all of acquired rights, confianza legitima and legal predictability
(seguridad juridica) fall within the protected ambit of the good faith principle and are thus
united by a common thread'. It would then be the “rarest of circumstances” not to find a
violation of Annex 811(2)(b) on the basis of the facts and the law applying in the present
case, considered from the perspective of both applicable domestic and international law,
including the reference in this provision to the principle of good faith. Such proximity
between municipal and international law evokes the kind of convergence of legal principles
underlined in the European Court of Human Rights decision referred to at para. 9 above.

14. Under Colombian law, there is no limitation on the operation of these principles in respect
of environmental regulations. Specifically, Council of State Advisory Opinion 2233 of

9 (All citations to Colombian legal texts or cases in this opinion refer to their original text in Spanish). Article 58 of
the Colombian Consitution (Exhibit C-65) recites as follows: “Se garantizan la propiedad privada y los demas
derechos adquiridos con arreglo a las leyes civiles, los cuales no pueden ser desconocidos ni vulnerados por leyes
posteriores. Cuando de la aplicacién de una ley expedida por motivos de utilidad piblica o interés social, resultare
en conflicto los derechos de los particulares con la necesidad por ella reconocida, el interés privado deberé ceder al
interés piiblico o social. La propiedad es una fuuncidn social que implica obligaciones. Como tal, lees inherente una

e indemnizacion previa. Este se fijard consultando los intereses de la comunidad y del afectado. En los casos que

el legislador, dicha iacién podra por via admi iva, sujeta a posterior accién
contenciosa-administrativa, incluso respecto del precio”. The irretroactivity principle is further confirmed by
Article 46 of Law 685 of 2001 (Colombian Mining Code, Exhibit C-8): “Normatividad del contrato. Al contrato de
concesién le serdn aplicables durante el término de su ejecucién y durante sus prorrogas, las leyes mineras vigentes
al tiempo de su perfeccionamiento, sin excepcion o salvedad alguna. Si dichas leyes fueren modificadas 0 adicionadas
con posterioridad, al concesionario le serén aplicables estas tiltimas en cuanto amplien, confirmen o mejoren sus
prerrogativas exceptuando aquellas que prevean modificaciones de las contraprestaciones econémicas previstas en
favor del Estado o de las de Entidades Territoriales”.

11 December 2014 provides that: a) the doctrines of acquired rights and confianza legitima
apply (are not carved out or excluded) in connection with environmental regulations!!; and
b) both cases of retroactive application of the law in regard to acquired rights or of
retrospective application of the law in connection with ongoing relationships give rise to
compensation’. In fact, Constitutional Court Decision C-35 is an explicit acknowledgment
of the retroactive effects of its determinations because it expressly states that it is purposely
aimed at curing what is described as the then existing “deficient legal protection of paramo
ecosystems”!, in other words, at modifying the then existing law.

In the present case, notions of acquired rights and confianza legitima under Colombian
administrative law and converging notions of international law referred to above play a
central role in the evaluation of the factual and legal context of the situations that give rise
to these Treaty claims, including expropriation claims.

Focusing now on the text of Annex 811 (2)(b), this provision requires an analysis of pacta
sunt servanda, good faith, proportionality, legitimate expectations and abuse of rights.
Such principles must be brought to bear when interpreting references to the “severity” or
the “purpose” of measures concerned by the application of Annex 811(2)(b).

As argued by the Claimant and shown in the witness testimony of Mark Mosely Williams
(unrebutted in this part), the Angostura deposit 150 hectares is the Concession’s most
attractive in terms of silver and gold reserves. This sector of the Concession overlaps
0.09 % of the Santurban Paramo (assuming (quod non) the Paramo delimitation pursuant
to Resolutions 2090 of 2014 of the Ministerio de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible'*and
Resolution VSC 829 of 2 August 2016 of the Agencia Nacional de Mineria'>), but deprives
the concessionaire of over 50 % of its Concession mining rights and renders mining under
the Concession economically inviable'®. However, neither the Constitutional Court
Decision C-035 of 2016 nor Resolution 2090 of 2014'’, which preceded Resolution VSC
829, can be taken as the final criterion of delimitation since later Constitutional Court
Decision T-361 of 2017 struck down Resolution 2090 and ordered a new delimitation of
the Paramo, albeit by taking into account the criteria set forth in Resolution 2090.

Nevertheless, the meaning or real effects of this latter Constitutional Court Decision are
less than clear, since: a) it did not delineate the Santurban Paramo; b) in vague terms, it

says that as a result of any delineation the levels of protection of the Paramo cannot be
lower “as to the protection of the environment” than the one afforded under Resolution
2090; c) still, it goes on to say, the demarcation of the Paramo in such Resolution can be
modified in view of errors committed in the demarcation; d) in any case, it also says, that
any ensuing modification cannot adversely affect measures to protect or safeguard the
Paramo “in global terms”; and e) it states that in the delimitation the classification of
Paramo zones under the Alexander Humboldt Institute (IAvH) report must be taken into
account!*, At any event, the order in this Decision to the Ministry of the Environment
to delimit the Paramo within one year, in the form of an administrative act, was never
carried out.

19. On 24 December 2016, the Constitutional Court refused to clarify its Decision C-035
despite various indications from different sectors that its meaning and effects were
unclear!®. It should also be noted that different laws, resolutions or court decisions
(e.g. Law 1930 of 20187 at Article 14; Resolution 769 of 2002 at Article 87!,
Constitutional Court decision T-361 of 2012 at para. 15.3.4°?; Council of State Advisory
Opinion 2233 of 2014, at 7-8)*? impose on the State, in compliance with its constitutional
duties, the unilateral obligation to acquire, on its own initiative, paramo areas, which, if
complied with, would likely have avoided Colombian law and international law violations
leading to the Claimant’s claims in this case; however, despite the vital ecological
importance of this natural resource and Colombia’s constitutional duties which, since 1997
(Law 373), required Colombia to acquire paramo areas (and accordingly to delimit such
areas to determine what was to be acquired) it granted instead, in 2007, a Concession to
the Claimant without first establishing whether it overlapped or not with paramo area
subject to Colombia paramo acquisition obligations. Colombia did not attempt either to
acquire the concession rights it had granted the Claimant limited to the Concession sector
comprising the Santurban Paramo, which would have been in line with the mandate set
forth in Law 373 to protect the paramos.

20. No due diligence in 2007 — when the Concession was executed — could have anticipated
the uncertainties and accompanying contradictions created by State conduct postdating the
Concession summarized in paras. 16-19 above”*. Further, no due diligence on the side of
the Claimant could have enabled it to predict the radical impairment of its Concession
rights through host State conduct or justify the State’s breach of its own, constitutionally

mandated obligations to protect the paramos, reminded by the Colombian Council of
State?>, which were ignored when granting the Concession. In the specific context of the
transactions at stake, this situation of inequality gives rise to both legal and moral
obligations on the State not to unreasonably or disproportionately exercise its unilateral
regulatory or police powers”®, since the Respondent is solely responsible for failing to carry
out any due diligence or conduct itself and for its lack of foresight when determining the
legal entitlement vested in the private party under the Concession having in mind the social
or State interests compromised by granting it.

21. Further, blanket or general statements as to environmental protection prior to the
Concession could not have alerted the Claimant about specific issues regarding its
concession rights and their scope or delimitation, but certainly should have alerted the State
not to grant concession rights actually or potentially interfering in its laws or obligations
regarding Paramo protection, including preliminary due diligence to avoid such
interference, which should have included the delimitation of the Paramo through State
action prior to granting the Concession. It was exclusively in the hands of the State to
delimit the Paramo: the private party could not substitute itself for the State to carry out
such delimitation. If the State did not have this foresight, nor could the Claimant have
had it.

22. The IAVH was created pursuant to the 1993 General Environmental Law7’. It took it
17 years to issue its 2007 Report on the paramos”®, including Santurban, evaluating their
fragility and establishing their general geographic dimension (but not the Santurban
delimitation) after the execution of the Concession. The Claimant could not have
anticipated this through a due diligence, that was clearly not undertaken by the State itself
in protecting a Paramo already identified in the Colombian maps since 18517° and — as it
was of public knowledge — which had been subject to continuing — apparently destructive —
mining operations since then without effective counter-action by the Colombian State
despite this Paramo’s seemingly obvious delicate ecosystem characteristics.

23. The radical impairment of the concessionaire’s acquired rights arising out of state conduct
consisting, inter alia, of the uncertain Angostura deposit delimitation, rooted in turn in the
uncertainty of the Concession delimitation itself, cannot be dissociated from the parallel
neutralization of the exercise of such rights to, for example, obtain the mining licenses,
necessarily requiring the previous delimitation of the licensed area in which the exploration
and exploitation activities would be carried out. In such respect (and for all legal purposes,
including for assessing the existence of an indirect expropriation under the Treaty), it is not
possible — unless adopting a formalistic approach — to dissociate an acquired right under
applicable law from its exercise: there is no distinction between denying the existence of
an acquired right and neutralizing its exercise through private or State action or conduct,

as it has happened in this case. Acquired rights are as much ignored when their existence
is rejected as when their exercise is impaired. Therefore, a holistic evaluation of the
situation at stake shows that the Claimant’s acquired rights have been denied in their
entirety and, accordingly, that an illicit taking under the Treaty has ensued.

24. The uncertainties in the Concession delimitation were in part prompted by social strife
between water users in the city of Bucaramanga and miners in the Vetas Municipality.
However, the Claimant did not originate nor could predict the impact of this social strife
on the delineation of the Paramo as a result of the measures. Rather, the State (in
compliance with its basic political and social obligations) should have been aware of the
clash of interests between different sectors of its population (as testified by Minister Luz
Helena Sarmiento*® and acknowledged by the Colombian Constitutional Court?!) which —
as accepted in the decision — in substantial part account for the State’s meandering conduct
regarding the Paramo before and after the adoption of the measures and the uncertainty
regarding its delimitation, existing even today.

25. Therefore, a comparative evaluation of the severity of: (i) the detriment to the Paramo
sought to be prevented by Resolution 2090, the Constitutional Court Decision C-35 and
Resolution VSC 829 (collectively, the “Measures” in light of their purpose (as set forth in
Annex 811 2 (b)), and (ii) the deprivation of the Claimant’s rights caused by the Measures,
must necessarily take into account that the Paramo delimitation relied upon by the
Measures when adopted was, without any fault attributable to the Claimant, not accurate,
was still subject to modification or review, and in any case was not final, and that the
Measures, which could not have been anticipated by the Claimant when contracting, were
harmful to the Claimant by substantially depriving it from its acquired rights under the
Concession, particularly in connection with the Angostura deposit. The Respondent was
fully responsible for such uncertainty, the very existence of which also constituted a
violation of the Respondent’s constitutional duties. Such evaluation must also take into
account the relatively minimum effects on the Santurban Paramo on mining the Angostura
deposit, which — even if hypothetically considering the correctness of the Paramo
delimitation pursuant to the Measures — only affects less than 1% of the entire Paramo.

26. In view of the foregoing, the proportionality and abuse of rights principles — which are
closely linked and operate in tandem — and the good faith principle, including the notion
of legitimate expectations inherent to it, referred to in Annex 811(2)(b), require a weighing
and balancing exercise**. Such balancing and weighing exercise, also warranted under

22 Not only this weighing and balancing exercise along lines of proportionality and reasonableness should be applied
when construing and applying Annex 811(2) in accordance with international law, but it is also mandated under
Colombian law in expropriation cases (when the constitutionality of the applicable norm is challenged, but which,
mutatis mutandis, is set forth as a general principle (Constitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016)
(Exhibit C-42), at paras. 52-53, 56-57, para. 61 at p. 64)). According to this Decision, the most stringent constitutional
controls are brought to bear when applying such principle in situations in which a rule of law is applied retroactively,
since in those cases, principles of legal certainty, good faith and confianza legitima turn the weighing exercise table
in favor of the private party (Jbidem, paras. 74-75 at p. 71).

Colombian constitutional law, is part and parcel of a determination of the scope and limits
of such principles, in light of the State public and regulatory powers*>.

27. The adverse and severe impact of the Measures on the Claimant’s Concession rights is
undisputed, since it is not questioned that as a result of the Measures the Concession is, for
all practical effects, deprived of economic value or, in other terms, that the Claimant’s
investment was destroyed. In view of the uncertain nature of the delimitation exercise on
which the Measures are based, it is not possible to conclude that such Measures’ objectives
— protecting the Paramo — were pursued or adopted in good faith or are proportionate to
attaining such objective. The omission by Colombia to delimit the Paramo before granting
the Concession and Colombia however later resorting to its unilateral law making power
to impose on the concessionaire a Paramo delimitation the deficiencies of which have been
already highlighted, thereby retroactively damaging the concessionaire’s rights without
compensation, is not compatible either with the principle of good faith, referred to in Treaty
Annex 811(2)*4. Absent a reliable delimitation of the Paramo, it is not possible to grasp
which is the real harm (if any) posed by the rights under the Concession to the purposes of
protecting the Paramo ecosystem purportedly sought by the Measures. Therefore, the
severity of the harm inflicted on the Claimant is not proportionate to the protective
objectives of the Measures since: a) obviously, the Measures were neither reasonable nor
appropriate to such effect because the Santurban Paramo delimitation ensuing from the
Measures could not be assumed to be final or correct in view of the Constitutional Court
Decision T-361 of 2017*°, and b) the Measures were anyway enforceable irrespective of
any action or opposition of the Claimant to such enforcement.

28. Because of their purpose — protecting the Santurban Paéramo — the Measures qualify as
measures “designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives” alluded to
in Annex 811(2)(b), which include the protection of the environment. However, the
unilateral pursuit of such objectives by the State without the payment of compensation
cannot be privileged without ignoring the reference to rare circumstances because an
interpretation of this provision ignoring such express qualification of the State’s rights to
protect the public welfare would be incorrect: the reference to rare circumstances clearly
signifies that such State rights are not absolute or unbound, and that their exercise, even if
hypothetically assuming its validity under the applicable national law, may require —
depending on the circumstances — compensation in order not to infringe international law*°.

33 Constitutional Court, Judgment No, C-35 (8 February 2016) (Exhibit C-42), para. 124 at p. 117.

> The good faith standard under international law is an objective one. There is no need to prove bad faith intention or
motivation in order to show absence of good faith. As stated at para. 161 of S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada,
UNCITRAL, Partial Award (13 November 2000) (Exhibit RL-55): “The intent of government is a complex and
multifaceted matter [and] {e]ach of the many persons involved in framing government policy may approach a problem
from a variety of different policy objectives and may sometimes take into account partisan political factors or career
concerns. The Tribunal can only characterize CANADA’s motivation or intent fairly by examining the record of the
evidence as a whole”.

38 Constitutional Court, Judgment No. T-361 (30 May 2017) (Exhibit C-244).

36 “Eypropriatory environmental measures — no matter how laudable and beneficial to society as a whole — are, in
this respect, similar to any other expropriatory measures that a state may take in order to implement its policies:
where property is expropriated, even for environmental purposes, whether domestic or international, the state’s

9

29. On the other hand, the pursuit of such objectives by the State or, specifically, the purpose
of the Measures, is not adversely affected, impeded, prevented or interfered with through
the assertion or enforcement of the Claimant’s rights under Annex 811(2)(b) seeking the
payment of compensation under Treaty Article 811(1), since such payment does not
preclude any action undertaken or to be undertaken by Colombia to protect the Santurban
Paramo in pursuit of the public welfare protection objectives referred to in such Annex. In
rare circumstances — like the ones described above — the severity of imposing the payment
of compensation as a result of the Measures (the enforcement of which, or the advancement
of the policies underlying them, was and remains unhindered) does not outweigh the
severity of the deprivation of the Claimant’s acquired rights under the Concession and of
the ensuing destruction of the Claimant’s investment.

30. Asset forth in connection with State contracts against the backdrop of the exercise of State
police powers:

“The result of the general principle here advanced is therefore that the
public authority may be exempt from performing its contract according to
its strict expression, but that where this exemption results in a loss to the
individual contractor compensation should be payable save where that
payment would offend the principle. Such cases should arise only where the
burden of payment would be such that it could not be borne by the public
authority".

There is nothing in the record of this arbitration indicating or even suggesting that
Colombia would not be able to bear the payment of the compensation due and payable to
the investor in the present case.

31. Consequently:

(ji The Measures retroactively impose a delimitation on the Santurban Paramo, with
direct and adverse impact on the Angostura deposit, and with the effect of
substantially depriving the Claimant of the economic value of its acquired rights
under the Concession without compensation, and thus constitute a violation of
Treaty Article 811(1) and its Annex 811(2)(b).

(ii) By retroactively imposing the Santurban Paramo delimitation but at the same time
undermining the accuracy and reliability of such delimitation, and thus creating
uncertainty as to the very scope of the Measures and their effects, the Respondent
has violated the concessionaire’s acquired rights under the Concession, deprived

performance or injunctions or their equivalent but “C ion is not thereby necessarily also eliminated, since it
is the of, or ion from, a i act which is ob to the general rule, and not the payment
of money” (also at 20).

the concessionaire’s rights of their economic value, and thus are part and parcel of
the violation by the Respondent of Treaty Article 811(1) and Annex 811(2)(b).

The Measures infringe Colombian constitutional law rules precluding the
retroactive application of the law without compensation, the constitutional duties
of the Colombian State regarding the delimitation of the Paramo and the acquisition
of Paramo covered areas, and Colombian and international law principles
precluding the violation both of legitimate expectations and contractual acquired
rights under the Concession covered by the investment definition of the Treaty and
protected under its provisions and international law.

Even if the Measures’ purposes were considered in isolation, the fulfilment of such
purposes is not jeopardized since the enforcement of the Measures is not prevented
nor is it rendered impossible or impracticable. For that reason, also in light of the
considerations set out in paras. 5-30 above, not paying compensation as required
by Treaty Article 811(1) would inflict severe and unwarranted damages to the
investor, precisely in a rare circumstance situation pursuant to Treaty
Annex 811(2)(b) in which compensation is warranted.

The above is confirmed by a weighing and balancing exercise carried out by taking
into account the Measure’s purposes and the harm suffered by the Claimant
occasioned by the Measures. As a result of this exercise, the comparative severity
of the harm and deprivation suffered by the Claimant and its investment resulting
from the Measures outweighs the severity of the Respondent’s obligation to
compensate under the Treaty.

Under such circumstances, the Measures are: a) neither reasonable nor proportionate to the
harm to the Claimant resulting from the Measures; i.e, the destruction of its investment; b)
objectively incompatible with State conduct pursued in accordance with both international
customary law principles of good faith, referred to in Treaty Annex 811(2)(b) (including
the principles of proportionality and protection of legitimate expectations) and pacta sunt
servanda; c) constitute an arbitrary deprivation of the Claimant’s contractual rights under
the Concession the exercise of which did not and does not preclude or prevent
Respondent’s actions seeking the protection of the Santurban Paramo; and (d) thus
constitute an illicit indirect expropriation in violation of Treaty Article 811(1) and its
Annex 811(2)(b), which finally culminated on 8 August 2016 (date of notification to the
Claimant of ANM Resolution VSC 829).

ICSID Case No. ARB/16/41

 

PARTIAL DISSENT OF PROFESSOR PHILIPPE SANDS QC

 

This case turns on a struggle between competing societal objectives which pull in
opposite directions: on the one hand, the protection of the treaty rights of an
international investor; on the other hand, the ability of a community to take legitimate
measures to conserve its environment. In the present matter, the issues which are
presented to the Tribunal concern the lawfulness of the approach taken by the
government of Colombia, on behalf of the Respondent, to reconcile the protection of
the Santurban Paramo with the rights granted to Eco Oro, the Claimant, under the 2008
Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia, which entered

into force on 15 August 2011 (the FTA).

The dispute is centred on measures adopted by Colombia to protect the Santurban
Paramo, a high mountain ecosystem. The paramo is known to provide a significant role
in maintaining biodiversity, with a unique capacity to retain, restore and distribute water
across extended areas. This function is of great importance for the broader ecosystems,
and for human populations. There is no dispute as to the significance of the paramos of
Colombia, or that they represent a majority of such ecosystems around the world, and
that they are subject to established and far-reaching protections under the laws of

Colombia and international law.

The FTA between Canada and Colombia has evidently been drafted with care, to ensure
that measures properly taken to protect the respective environments of the two countries
are not undermined by rights granted to foreign investors. This shared concern for the
environment is reflected in the FTA’s specific provisions on (i) applicable law,!

(ii) police powers,” and (iii) exceptions.*

' Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered
into force on 15 August 2011) (Exhibit C-22; see also Exhibit R-137), Article 832 (the Tribunal “shall decide
the issues in dispute in accordance with [the FTA] and applicable rules of international law”).

2 Id., Annex 811(2)(b) (“Except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or series of measures is so severe
in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith, non-
discriminatory measures by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives,
for example ... the protection of the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation”).

3 See id., Article 2201(3) (‘For the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the requirement that such
measures are not applied in a manner that constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investment
or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in this Agreement
shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary: ... (c) For the conservation
of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources”).

4. The Tribunal has concluded that it has jurisdiction over the claims brought by Eco Oro,
and (by a majority) that the indirect expropriation claim submitted under Article 811 of
the FTA should be dismissed, having regard to the provisions of Annex 811(2)(b) on
police powers. I support these conclusions. A majority of the Tribunal has further
concluded that the claim brought by Eco Oro in respect of Article 805 of the FTA should
succeed. I respectfully disagree with this conclusion. The approach taken by the
majority fails to respect the text agreed by the drafters of the FTA, and is likely to

undermine the protection of the environment.

Article 805

5. Article 805(1) of the FTA provides:

“Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in
accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of
treatment of aliens, including fair and equitable treatment and full
protection and security. The concepts of ‘fair and equitable treatment’
and ‘full protection and security’ do not require treatment in addition
to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law

minimum standard of treatment of aliens.”

This language makes clear — as the Majority recognises — that the standard of protection
which has been granted to the investor is the Minimum Standard of Treatment (‘MST’),
the one that exists in customary international law. The standard to be applied by the
Tribunal is not the Fair and Equitable Treatment (‘FET’) standard, one that is to be
found and applied in other investment protection agreements. The parties to the FTA
have reinforced the distinction between the two different standards by the authoritative
interpretation of Article 805 and MST adopted in 2017 by the Joint Commission
established under the FTA; this confirms that the investor has “the burden to prove a

rule of customary international law invoked under Article 805”.*

4 Joint Commission of the Free Trade Agreement Between the Republic of Colombia and Canada, Decision No. 6
(24 October 2017) (Exhibit R-139).

6. As acknowledged by both the ICJ and the ILC, the fact that the FET provision can be
found in a number of treaties is not enough to affect the content of customary
international law.° Indeed, the widespread inclusion of FET provisions supports the
opposite conclusion, as states which include such provisions in their treaties may be
understood as expressing a desire to depart from the standard in customary international
law. As with all rules of customary international law, the crucial issue is whether there
is sufficient evidence of state practice and opinio juris to support the conclusion of the
existence of a rule of customary law. As noted below, the majority has made no effort
to address that evidentiary requirement, ignoring the explicit requirement of the FTA
drafters that the Claimant must prove the content of the rule of customary international

law invoked under Article 805.

7. In the past, certain tribunals have — accidentally or deliberately — sought to equate or
meld the MST and FET standards. The two standards may share a common aim of
imposing restrictions on the manner and extent to which a state is required to treat a
foreign investor in its territory, but they do so to in different ways. A breach of the
customary MST standard would invariably give rise to a breach of the FET standards,
but the reverse is generally not the case. This is because the MST standard sets a much

higher bar.
8. The position was stated with care and clarity in 1981, by F.A. Mann, who wrote:

“The terms ‘fair and equitable treatment’ envisage conduct which goes
far beyond the minimum standard and afford protection to a greater
extent and according to a much more objective standard than any
previously employed form of words. A tribunal would not be concerned
with a minimum, maximum or average standard. It will have to decide
whether in all circumstances the conduct in issue is fair and equitable

or unfair and inequitable. No standard defined by other words is likely

to be material. The terms are to be understood and applied

independently and autonomously.”®

Dr Mann’s conclusion, which is as pertinent today as when it was written, does not
mean that the law on MST is set in stone, or is static. It does mean, however, that there
is a cardinal distinction between the two standards, and in carrying out its task the duty
of a tribunal is bound to take that distinction and apply it to the facts of the case. A
failure to do so amounts to a departure from the intentions of the drafters of the FTA.
As the Joint Commission has made clear, the burden is on the Claimant to prove the
content of the customary rule, and that the standard it sets forth has not been met. A
tribunal that melds the two terms, or which misapplies one standard (MST) by applying
the conditions of the other (FET), or which fails to satisfy itself that the Claimant has
met its requisite burdens of proof, or which fails to give effect to the intentions of the
drafters, risks adopting an approach which might be said to manifestly exceed

its powers.

9. In the present case, the Claimant has not met the burden of showing sufficient state
practice, independent of the mere existence of FET provisions in modern investment
treaties, to establish that the customary standard has evolved so as to be identical
(or similar) to the FET standard. Nor has the Claimant offered any plausible evidence
on the requisite opinio juris. In so proceeding, the Claimant has not engaged with the
deliberate and explicit drafting choice made by the parties to the FTA, one that is
premised on the customary standard (MST) continuing to have its own identity,

autonomy and component elements.

10. The tribunal in Glamis Gold v United States of America noted that although the exact
formulation of the MST in the old case of Neer is no longer directly applicable as such,
the customary standard it articulated has not radically changed.’ That conclusion is
surely right. As outlined by the Majority in this case, the starting point in determining
whether a state’s conduct has breached the MST is whether it has acted in a way which

is “arbitrary or grossly unfair or discriminatory, or otherwise inconsistent with the

°F. A. Mann, ‘British Treaties for the Promotion and Protection of Investments’ (1981) 52 British Yearbook of
International Law 241, 244.

4

customary international law standard”.* The state’s conduct must be “egregious and
shocking”, and lead to an outcome which “offends judicial propriety”.!° In applying
the standard it is important that a tribunal’s analysis is made “‘in the light of the high
measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic
authorities to regulate matters within their own borders”.!! The Claimant has offered
no plausible evidence to support a different standard, and the Majority Decision has
cited no authority or evidence to support its conclusion. Whilst a finding of bad faith or
malicious intention on the part of the state is not required, the threshold for finding a
breach of the MST nevertheless remains very high, such that a finding that it has been
breached must be based on facts which are truly exceptional. Although the ordinary
decision-making processes of states may result in a breach of the FET standard, a breach
of the MST is not an everyday occurrence and should be found only in truly egregious

circumstances. !?

11. The Majority has sought to construct its finding of a breach of the MST on three
intertwined strands of reasoning: first, that the Respondent breached the Claimant’s
legitimate expectations; second, that the Respondent failed to provide a stable and
predictable legal environment; and third, that the Respondent acted arbitrarily in its
dealing with the Claimant. The approach is novel. I disagree with the Majority’s
reasoning in relation to all three strands, as there is no evidence to support the approach

to the MST standard, or the finding that there has been a breach of it.

Legitimate Expectations

12. The notion of legitimate expectations has become a frequent and controversial issue in
investment treaty disputes. It has become a recognised element of the FET standard,

but its role in the context of an MST inquiry is not yet established.

13.

First, as acknowledged by the Majority, in the context of the MST the failure to observe
a claimant’s legitimate expectations is just one factor a tribunal may take into account
in determining whether there has been a breach of the MST.!* The claimant must still
show that the failure to observe its legitimate expectations was, in the circumstances,

serious enough to amount to egregious and shocking behaviour.

. Second, and more pertinently, if legitimate expectations are to have any place in the

context of MST, the concept will have a more limited role than in relation to FET.
Unlike in a FET inquiry, there is no authority for the proposition that it will be sufficient
for a claimant to point to reliance on legislative provisions or broad statements. Rather,
the limited jurisprudence that exists (in the NAFTA context) indicates inter alia that a
claimant must be able to establish a “quasi-contractual” relationship or expectation, '*
in the sense that the state must have made “explicit” or “specific” encouragements or
representations on which the investor has placed reliance.'> The Majority’s analysis
fails to acknowledge or address this requirement, and in so doing has in effect conflated

the FET and MST.

. The Majority concludes that the Claimant had three legitimate expectations: (i) it would

be entitled to undertake mining exploitation activities in the entirety of the area covered
by Concession 3452; (ii) in the event that the State were to expropriate Eco Oro’s
acquired rights, compensation would be payable; and (iii) that Colombia would ensure

a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment.

. With regard to (i), there is no evidence before the Tribunal to establish that the

Respondent gave a “quasi-contractual” commitment that the Claimant would have the
right to exploit the entirety of the Concession area. Indeed, the right to exploit was
premised on the relevant environmental authorisations being obtained, in circumstances

in which the Claimant was aware at the time of its investment that the grant of such

authorisations was uncertain. To get around this fact, the Majority relies mainly on
general statements of encouragement from certain of the Respondent’s ministers and
officials, as well as the mere fact of the granting of the Concession, but neither gives
rise to a “quasi-contractual” relationship. As the Tribunal acknowledges in relation to
the expropriation claim, the Claimant was aware, or should have been aware, of the
existence and effect of the paramo in the Concession area; that the Respondent was
committed to the protection of the environment, and that its right or ability to go beyond
exploration to exploit the Concession area was subject to the overriding need to protect
the environment. Considering that, in its analysis of the Art 811 claim, these same facts
led the Tribunal to conclude that the Claimant had not received a specific assurance or
representation such as to give rise to a legitimate expectation, '° it is wholly inconsistent

for the Majority to reach a different conclusion in its analysis of the Art 805 claim.

. Likewise, I do not believe that there was any quasi-contractual commitment with regard

to expectations (ii) and (iii). The Claimant has not pointed to any specific assurances
that it would receive compensation in the event of an expropriation, or that the
Respondent would ensure a predictable framework for planning and investing. Any
investor could claim to have such ‘expectations’ on the basis of the Respondent’s
domestic law and general statements from ministers and officials, but these would not
be protected under the MST. I find the reference to expectation (ii) particularly odd
given that the Tribunal has concluded that no expropriation has taken place.
The concepts of stability and predictability, which underpin expectation (iii), are

addressed below.

. There is a further difficulty with the majority’s conclusion that the Respondent has

violated the Claimant’s legitimate expectations under MST (and 805). The Tribunal has
recognised that: (1) in order to rely on a claim of legitimate expectation (under FET) an
investor must show that its expectation would have been shared by a “prudent” or
“reasonable investor”, and to that end it must have engaged in some sort of due

diligence;'’ (2) there is nothing in the record before it to show that any due diligence

17 See Tribunal’s Decision, paras. 681, 762; see Antaris & Géde v Czech Republic, PCA Case No. 2014-01, Award
of 2 May 2018, para. 360(6): “in order to rely on legitimate expectations the investor should inquire in advance
regarding the prospects of a change in the regulatory framework in light of the then prevailing or reasonably to be
expected changes in the economic and social conditions of the host State.”

7

was undertaken by Eco Oro in respect of any of the representations upon which it was
said to have relied; '* (3) “the most cursory due diligence even before Concession 3452
was granted would have revealed (i) the potential existence of a paramo ecosystem
within the boundaries of Concession 3452; (ii) the Government’s commitment and
obligation to protect these ecosystems; and (iii) that such protection could be achieved
by the imposition of a mining ban”;!? (4) Eco Oro had no “distinct reasonable
investment backed expectations that exploitation would be permitted in the entirety of

the concession area”;??

and (5) an appropriate due diligence exercise would have
advised Eco Oro “that Colombia could retrospectively impose a mining ban on all or
part of Concession 3452 to protect a paramo ecosystem”.”! Yet notwithstanding these
rather clear conclusions, largely in relation to the failed Article 811 claim, the majority
nevertheless concludes that Eco Oro had a legitimate expectation in relation to MST,
on which it could rely notwithstanding the total absence of any exercise of due
diligence. In reaching its conclusion (at paras. 804 and 805 of the Decision), the

majority passes in silence on due diligence.”

Stability and Predictability

19. The Majority’s reliance on the concepts of stability and predictability are no less
problematic. Despite the Majority’s tendency to refer to the concepts separately, they
are closely interconnected and cannot really be said to be distinct in any meaningful
sense; indeed, it is not clear from the Decision what the Majority understands to be the
difference between stability and predictability. In any case, the obligation to provide
stability or predictability has no foundation in the FTA or in the case law on the MST.
In its initial explanation of the MST, the Majority makes no mention of matters of
legal or regulatory stability; indeed, at various parts of the Decision, including at
paragraph 749, the Majority explicitly states that the Respondent is not under an

obligation to provide a stable legal framework. Yet when it comes to the application of

2! Tribunal’s Decision, para. 765.

» In relation to the Article 811 claim, the majority concludes that “Eco Oro could not have anticipated through
due diligence the immense confusion in the applicable legal regime created by the contradictory State decisions
and changing positions of different State organs” on the delimitation of the paramo (Tribunal’s Decision, para.
696). In reaching this conclusion, the majority offers no evidence: it is mere assertion, unsupported by the record
of the proceedings. The point is not made in relation to the Article 805 claim.

8

the MST standard to the facts of the case, out of nowhere the obligation of stability
suddenly emerges, as though magically concocted out of thin air, with no reference to
be found either to the Claimant’s evidentiary burdens (on state practise or opinio juris
in relation to the customary law standard) or any legal authority. Legal or regulatory
stability is then mentioned repeatedly in the Majority’s reasoning, most brightly at
paragraphs 754, 762, 781, 803 and 805; this is despite that fact that legal and regulatory
stability has never before been treated as part of MST, and no authority or evidence is

cited for the conclusion.

2

S

. The reliance on predictability, to the extent that it is distinct from stability, is also
unsupported by any evidence or authority. The sole source which the Majority invokes
in relation to the relevance of predictability is a single line in the preamble to the FTA.
It is, however, widely recognised that a preambular aspiration cannot as such give rise

to a hard edged or actionable obligation.”*

2

. This reliance on stability and predictability is therefore manifestly incorrect. To be sure,
there is ongoing debate as to whether the FET standard encapsulates any sort of an
obligation to ensure legal and regulatory stability, with the weight of jurisprudence
indicating that such an obligation only exists where the FET provision in question
explicitly mentions stability. Without such clear language, most tribunals have
recognised that international investment law does not — and cannot, and should not —
freeze the regulatory environment of a host state, and must not act in effect as a
mechanism of insurance system for investors.*+ The decision of treaty parties — as in
this FTA — not to include a stability clause in an international agreement is one that a
Tribunal must take seriously, as it represents a deliberate choice of the drafters to

preserve a greater degree of regulatory discretion. The same goes for domestic

legislation. Invoking the concept of legitimate expectations, as the Majority does by

way of magical thinking, cannot change this.”°

. These considerations apply with particular force under the customary MST, which is
the standard applicable in this case. Where is the authority for the proposition that a
failure to provide stability or predictability can give rise to a violation of the MST
standard? The Majority has cited none. I am aware of none. The Majority has
effectively engaged in judicial law-making; it has invented a new element for the
identification of the customary standard which no state has appeared to have articulated,
in the total absence of any evidence of state practise or opinio juris. Despite the fact
that the drafters of the FTA have made it clear that in relation to Article 805 and MST
a claimant must prove the customary rule, with all that implies for evidence of state
practise and opinio juris, the Majority makes no mention of these elements in relation
to the facts of stability or predictability. Without evidence of opinion juris or state

practise, the claim to a customary standard does not get off the ground.

o

. The Majority has not explained why what has happened in Colombia is contrary to the
tule of law — indeed, it has done the very opposite, invoking a series of legislative and
regulatory acts and ensuing litigation, including before the Constitutional Court, in its
narrative. The Claimant’s own witnesses and experts testified as to the existence of
remedies still available to the Claimant, and the failure to pursue them, and the
plausibility of decisions of the Constitutional Court, even if they do not necessarily
agree with them. The comportment of Colombia may not be perfect, but in failing to
provide stability or predictability it cannot be said to violate the rule of law, or
customary law, or to even come close to shocking or offending a sense of judicial
propriety. By concluding as it has, the Majority ignores the obvious diligence with
which the Constitutional Court of Colombia addressed matters of considerable
complexity, offering reasons for all of its conclusions which are drafted with evident
care and balance. There is here a manifest inconsistency in the conclusions of the

Majority. In the absence of an aggravating factor, such as one of Professor Schreuer’s

(Exhibit RL-81), paras 289-290.

indicia, mere instability can never of itself be serious enough to give rise to a breach of

the MST.

24. Consequently, I do not believe that, in itself, the stability or predictability of the

domestic legal framework has any relevance in determining whether the Respondent

has breached the MST.

Arbitrariness

25. Iagree with the Majority that a state which acts arbitrarily may be in breach of the MST.

2

a

The starting point in assessing whether a state has acted arbitrarily is the decision of the
International Court of Justice in ELS/. In that case the Court indicated that a finding of
arbitrariness was only appropriate when a state has acted contrary to the rule of law, or
its conduct shocks or offends a sense of juridical propriety.”° Similar language has also
been used by investment tribunals,” and it continues to reflect the state of the law today.
The Claimant has offered no plausible evidence to support a contrary view, and the

Majority Decision has cited no authority to the contrary.

. In assessing arbitrariness, tribunals must recognise that they should not simply

substitute their own views on a particular issue for those of the host state. As stated by
the tribunal in Cargill v Mexico, and cited by the Majority, “an actionable finding of
arbitrariness must not be based simply on a tribunal’s determination that a domestic
agency or legislature incorrectly weighed various factors, made legitimate
compromises between disputing constituencies, or applied social or economic
reasoning in a manner that the tribunal criticises”.** I fully agree with the Majority that
the indicia of arbitrariness given by Professor Christoph Schreuer in EDF (Services)

Limited v Romania are relevant to the customary MST and helpful in the present case.”°

27. For the reasons outlined above, mere instability cannot amount to a breach of the MST.
Beyond ‘instability’, the Majority’s conclusion appears to turn on its view that the
Respondent acted for a reason other than environmental protection, and/or that the
Respondent did not act for a legitimate purpose.*° This view seems to be based on three
factors: that the Respondent referred to factors other than environmental protection in
some of its decision-making processes; that there were competing approaches to the
delimitation of the Santurban Pardmo in different parts of the Respondent’s
government; and that the Respondent has not eliminated illegal mining in its territory.
In my view, these factors, whether taken individually or cumulatively, are manifestly

not sufficiently grave to amount to arbitrariness, or a breach of the MST.

28. In determining whether measures taken by a state is arbitrary to the point of being
shocking, tribunals must be sensitive to the difficulties of government decision-making
in the face of legitimate objectives that pull in different directions. In the search for
balance, and in the face of competing pressures, different arms of the same government
may inevitably give expression to different and potentially conflicting priorities.
As noted above, this is particularly the case when the protection of the environment or
human health is at stake (one need only think of the current challenges faced by so
many governments around the world as they confront the emerging reality of global
warming/climate change and biodiversity losses and their consequences, or the reality
of Covid-19, as governments struggle to find a way through the difficulties of protecting

human health whilst also securing economic wellbeing).

29. Although states increasingly sign treaties committing themselves to the protection of
the environment, they are still often under pressure to prioritise other social objectives.
These competing objectives will often be economic in nature. As concern about the
protection of the environment increases, states are increasingly likely to be confronted
with decisions that involve complex trade-offs, making internal government debate
—and changes of direction — more likely. When a government does choose to prioritise
a certain interest, such as environmental protection, there are a variety of ways a policy

can be designed and implemented depending on the weight a government wishes to

>° Tribunal’s Decision, paras 810 and 821.

give to other interests. Such policy decisions imply delicate balancing acts and may
leave particular stakeholders disappointed or even financially worse-off. None of this,
in my view, is sufficient of itself to cast doubt on the sincerity of the government’s
stated objectives. These decisions and their consequences are not extraordinary in any

sense, but have become routine and the business of government.

. In this context, arbitrators and judges, as well as other adjudicators, must take care to

remain within the arbitral or judicial function: they must not legislate, and they must
take care not to trespass into a forbidden domain by imposing their own policy
preferences where the legislative branch — and perhaps also a divided executive arm —
oscillates over time between competing social objectives and policy goals. I fear that
the Majority has fallen into error: it has failed to take into account the realities of
governmental decision-making in legitimate domains, and the clear limits imposed by
the drafters of the FTA in relation to the protection of the environment, not least by
imposing the application of MST with all that implies for proving the content of the

customary rule.

On the factual record before the Tribunal, I do not consider that the behaviour of the
Respondent can be characterised as having shocked or offended a sense of juridical
propriety, or may be said to be contrary to the rule of law. Indeed, the Decision makes
crystal clear that Colombia has acted throughout in good faith, seeking to find
compromises in balancing the competing objectives of environmental protection and
economic development (in this case by means of mining activity). The Decision passes
in relative silence on the compelling testimony offered by witnesses, in particular
Ms Brigitte Baptiste, on behalf of the Respondent. As she explained, in her capacity as
Director General of the Alexander von Humboldt Institute (from 2010 to 2019), she
described how the Institute contributed to the delimitation of the paramo, confirming
the complexity of the task, the manner in which non-ecological factors were taken into
account, and the significance and challenge of delimiting the transition zone (strip)
between the paramo and other areas (“The transitional strip from any ecosystem to
another one is the area where you have the most ecological exchanges, where you have
the most flows because it is a border [...] So, the strip is key for the operation of the
ecosystem, and the strip is considered a key protection area for the paramo because this

is the ecosystem that is above, and also the flow of ecosystem and, in particular,

water.”>!) Ms Baptiste’s evidence on the delimitation was honest, balanced, compelling
and persuasive, reflective of her integrity; it strongly supported the conclusion that the
Respondent’s effort to delimit the paramo may not have been perfect, but it was carried
out in good faith, was motivated by genuine environmental considerations, and cannot
be said to have been arbitrary. Her evidence was undamaged by cross-examination or

other evidence.

32. Like many governments around the world, Colombia has found the challenge of taking
reasonable measures to protect its environment to be daunting, one that takes time and
is often composed of a multitude of decisions that apparently take contrary directions.
Ata time when the need to protect the environment is, in legal terms, a relatively recent
development, it is understandable that different parts of a government may on occasion
pull in different directions, or that over time contradictory legislation may be adopted,

or that different judicial decisions may be handed down.

33. In the age of climate change and significant loss of biological diversity, it is clear that
society finds itself in a state of transition. The law — including international law — must
take account of that state of transition, which gives rise to numerous uncertainties.
Adjudicators — judges and arbitrators — recognise the need to proceed with caution at a
time of transition and uncertainty. Indeed, the precautionary principle has been
developed to assist in the taking of decisions in times of uncertainty, and the Tribunal
has correctly determined that the application of the precautionary principle — treated as
being applicable as a rule of law in accordance with Article 832 of the FTA — to this
case has contributed to the conclusion that there has been no actionable violation of
Article 811 of the FTA. Yet in respect of Article 805, it seems that precaution has no

place for the Majority.

34. To be clear, the Respondent has not acted perfectly in its management of the paramo,
but the MST standard does not require it to have done so. Neither the MST nor the FTA
offer a right against confusion. The Majority is correct to point out that there were
problems with the manner in which the government handled the process of delimiting

the Santurban Paramo. It was slow, it was inconsistent, it was uncertain. The key

14

question, however, is: did the process of delimitation cross the line of departing from
the rule of law, or proceed on a basis that shocks our sense of juridical propriety? In my
view it did not, and the heart of the Decision makes that clear, premised as it is on the
view that the Respondent acted in good faith. Yet when it comes to the final and
permanent delimitation of the paramo, and all the difficulties that gave rise to, including
delays, the Majority has taken the evidence before the Tribunal and concluded that the
Respondent was somehow not truly motivated by the aim of environmental protection.
This conclusion is difficult to comprehend, given the evidence and the finding in the
context of the expropriation claim that the Respondent’s actions were motivated by a

desire to protect the environment.*?

Conclusion on Article 805

35. The Majority’s finding of a breach of Article 805 appears to be based on little more than
the evidence that the Respondent struggled with the compromises to be made as between
different interests, with reasoning and decision-making that was not as efficient, timely
or consistent as it could have been. Whilst there are legitimate criticisms to be made as
to how the Respondent acted, the same criticisms may be made of any government faced
with such decisions, and subject to judicial challenges at every stage. This is why the
standard to be applied is paramount, as reflected in the clearly expressed intentions of
the drafters of the FTA. In my view, the Majority has manifestly failed to apply the

correct standard.

36. The Majority’s analysis undercuts the plain meaning of the FTA and well-established
principles of customary law. The effect of its approach is to significantly lower the bar,
and in effect rewrite the FTA and the content and effect of MST. As the language of
the ICJ in ELS/ and other investment tribunals shows, a finding that a state has breached

the MST will be rare and extraordinary.

.It is not in dispute the protection of the paramo was a legitimate objective.
The designation of the general area of the paramo in 2007 has not been impugned, and

the Tribunal has recognised that the area in which mining has been prohibited has not

crossed a line of impropriety or illegality under the FTA. The Claimant went into this
project with its eyes open, knowing that it was investing in a paramo which was already
subject to certain protections, and it knew — or should have known — that over time
those protections were likely to become even more restrictive. By the time of its
renewed and revised project in 2011, when it abandoned an open cast mine for an
underground mine, the Claimant was well aware of the difficulties it faced. What the
Tribunal impugns is merely the fact that the Respondent has failed to give precise and
detailed effect in a timely manner to the permanent and final delimitation of the paramo
in accordance with a particular scale, timetable and factors. By any reasonable standard,
the situation faced by the Respondent, in seeking to give effect to a legitimate objective
of environmental protection, was challenging. Its approach in meeting that challenge
was not perfect, but it was not contrary to the rule of law, and it was not conduct that

shocked or offended a sense of juridical propriety.

The 2201(3) exception

Having concluded that there has been no breach of either Article 805 or Article 811,

I do not address the interpretation and applicability of Article 2201(3).

Retroactivity

Retroactivity, which has been addressed by Mr Grigera Naon as a matter of concern.
As a general proposition, outside of the criminal law context it cannot be said that there
is a strict rule against retroactivity. The point was addressed the tribunal in Cairn
Energy v India,® a case concerned with whether retroactive tax measures violated the
FET standard, independently of the doctrine of legitimate expectations. This appears to
be the first decision to consider the point in any detail.*+ The tribunal rejected the
proposition that a principle of legal certainty entailed an absolute prohibition against

retroactive measures.*° Instead, it stated that retroactive measures may not lead to a

(21 December 2020) (Arbs. Laurent Lévy (Pres.), Stanimir A. Alexandrov and J. Christopher Thomas QC).

breach of the FET when taken for the public interest and in conformity with the

principle of proportionality.*° A two stage test was suggested:

“(i) [T]he retroactive application of a new regulation is only justified
when the prospective application of that regulation would not achieve
the specific public purpose sought, and (ii) the importance of that
specific public purpose must manifestly outweigh the prejudice
suffered by the individuals affected by the retroactive application of

the regulation.”*7

Although in the context of an FET claim, the analysis in Cairn Energy is premised on
the proposition that it is not correct to assume that retroactive measures are strictly
prohibited. This is consistent with international case law and the practise of many
domestic legal systems, which do not support the idea of a general principle of law
(understood in the sense of Article 38 of the ICJ Statute) prohibiting retroactive
measures. The better view is that of the tribunal in Cairn Energy — that retroactive
measures are permissible if taken for the public interest and in accordance with the
principle of proportionality. The fact that a measure may have retroactive effects cannot
be sufficient for a tribunal to conclude that the facts of a case bring it within the “rare
circumstances” so that Annex 811 does not apply. Tribunals must instead consider
whether contested retroactive measures were taken in the public interest, and whether
they are proportionate. This ties in with the analysis in the Decision, as stated in paras
623-699, to the effect that the measures were taken in the public interest and were

proportionate.

Damages

4

So

. Having concluded that there has been no breach of Article 805 or Article 811, in my
view the question of damages does not arise. The majority having concluded otherwise,
in relation to Article 805, it will be necessary to have an additional phase to identify the

loss suffered by Eco Oro if any, and the methodology by which it is to be valued. In this

regard, as the questions put by the Tribunal make clear, the finding that Eco Oro had
no right to engage in any exploitation without the grant of necessary environmental
licenses, coupled with the absence of any exercise in due diligence as to what the
likelihood of receiving such licences was in relation to an underground mine, makes

this a not entirely straightforward task.

4

. In this regard, ss to the question of acquired rights,** it may be that as a matter of
Colombian law Eco Oro may be said to have rights that could be characterised, as the
majority does, as ‘acquired rights’. That characterisation, however, is of limited, if any,
consequence, for the case before us, which is concerned with what right Eco Oro
actually had under the FTA in relation to the concession. It had a right to explore, and
it had a right to apply for an environmental license which would allow it to engage in
future exploitation. It had no right, however, as such, to exploit, or to apply to extend
the concession for the purpose of future exploitation, without the grant of an
environmental license. Nor did Eco Oro have any right to an environmental license. To
conclude, as the majority does, that Eco Oro had an ‘acquired right’ to exploit subject
to the grant of a future (and speculative) environmental license does not, in my view,
materially assist in the identification and valuation of any loss as the majority may

determine to have occurred.
