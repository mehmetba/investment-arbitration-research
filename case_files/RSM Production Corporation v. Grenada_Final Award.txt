PART I: INTRODUCTION

(01) The Parties

1. RSM: The Claimant and Respondent to Counterclaim is RSM Production Corporation,
a company organised and existing under the laws of Texas, United States of America,
with its principal place of business located at 5299 Prentice Blvd, Suite 500,
Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111, USA. Its president and chief executive officer is
Mr Jack J. Grynberg, who is also a director of the company. Mr Grynberg has worked
as a petroleum engineer for more than thirty years. The company is owned by members
of Mr Grynberg’s family. (For ease of reference, the Claimant is here referred to as “the

Claimant” or “RSM.”)

2. | RSM’s Legal Representatives: In these proceedings, the Claimant was represented by
LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae (London), later Dewey & LeBoeuf, LLP (London
office) of 1 Minster Court, Mincing Lane, London EC3R 7YL, United Kingdom and
Grand Auzas & Associés (Paris), of 6 Rue Paul Valéry, 75116 Paris, France.

3. Grenada: The Respondent and Counterclaimant is Grenada. Grenada is an independent
State in the south-eastern Caribbean, north-west of Trinidad and Tobago and north of
Venezuela, with a population of about 100,000 persons. Grenada is a member of the
Commonwealth. (For ease of reference, the Respondent is here referred to as

“Grenada” or “the Respondent.”)

4. Grenada’s Legal Representatives: In these proceedings, Grenada was first represented
by DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary UK LLP, of 3 Noble Street, London EC2V 7EE,
United Kingdom. From November 2005, Grenada was represented by Freshfields
Bruckhaus Deringer LLP of Appollolaan 151, 1077 AR Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

(02) The Parties’ Dispute

5.

(03)

The Parties’ dispute arises from a written agreement made on 4 July 1996 (“the
Agreement”). It recorded a contractual arrangement whereby RSM intended to apply
for an “Exploration Licence” from Grenada for oil and gas over a designated area in the
waters off the islands of Grenada, Petite Martinique and Carriacou (divided into 42
licence blocks) and, in the event of commercial discovery, to apply for one or more
“Development Licences,” all such licences being granted by Grenada subject to the
Petroleum and Natural Gas Deposits Act 1989 of Grenada (“the 1989 Act”) and the

terms of the Parties’ Agreement.

In April 2004, RSM applied to Grenada for an Exploration Licence under the
Agreement and the 1989 Act. Grenada refused to grant this licence to RSM on 27 April
2004; and Grenada terminated the Agreement on 5 July 2005.

The Tribunal addresses further details of the Parties’ dispute below, in Part II of this
Award.

The Arbitration Agreement

Article 26, “Arbitration,” of the Parties’ Agreement provided:

“26.1 Any dispute or difference arising between the parties relating to the construction,
meaning or effect of this Agreement or the rights or liabilities of the parties hereunder,
or any matter arising out of the same or connected therewith shall be resolved
amicably by negotiations.

26.2 Subject to Clause 26.1 and 26.5 all disputes, differences or questions between the
parties to this Agreement with respect to any matter arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be referred to arbitration pursuant to Clause 26.3.

26.3 (a) Any unresolved dispute or difference aforesaid shall be submitted for
settlement by arbitration to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID) established by the Convention for the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of other States of 16 March 1965 and for this
purpose it is agreed that although the Company (as an investor) is a company

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 8 of 159

registered as a foreign company in Grenada, it is controlled by nationals of the United
States and shall be treated as a national of that State for the purpose of the Convention.

(b) Each dispute submitted by a party to arbitration shall be heard by an
Arbitration Board, composed of three arbitrators. Each party shall appoint one
arbitrator, and these two shall designate a third arbitrator, who shall chair the
Arbitration Board. If the arbitrators named by the parties fail to agree upon a third
arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the latter of the two arbitrators has been
appointed, or if any party does not appoint an arbitrator within thirty (30) days
following appointment of an arbitrator by the other party, such arbitrator shall, at the
request of either party, be designated by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of
ISCID [sic].

(c) If for any reason an arbitrator is unable to perform his functions, a
substitute shall be chosen in the same manner as the original arbitrator.

(d) Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, the third arbitrator
appointed pursuant to paragraph (a) shall not be a national of Grenada or of the
country where the parent company of the Company is incorporated.

26.4 (a) The said arbitration shall, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, be held
in London, England.

(b) The award resulting from arbitration shall be final and binding on the
parties.

26.5 Any matter in dispute between the parties under Clause 8.7, 13.5 and 13.7 shall be
referred for determination by a sole expert to be appointed by agreement between the
parties hereto and failing such agreement by the Chairman of the Administrative
Council of ICSID.”

The word “investor” is not here expressly defined. For ease of reference below, Article

26 of the Agreement is described as the “Arbitration Agreement.”

ICSID Convention: Both Grenada and the United States of America are Contracting
States to the 1965 ICSID Convention to which the Arbitration Agreement refers (as

above), having ratified this treaty in 1991 and 1966, respectively.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 9 of 159

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:

“The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of
an investment, between a Contracting State [...] and a national of another Contracting
State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When
the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.”

The term “investment” is not here expressly defined.

ICSID Arbitration Rules: It was common ground between the Parties that the relevant
arbitration rules, pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) of the ICSID Convention, were the Rules of

Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, as amended and effective on 1 January 2003.

(04) Applicable Laws

Article 28 of the Parties’ Agreement, “Applicable Law,” provides:

“This Agreement shall be governed by, interpreted and construed in accordance with
the Laws of Grenada.”

As regards the “Laws of Grenada,” it was common ground between the Parties that
recourse could be made to English common law; and both Parties did so extensively in

these proceedings [D5.205].

Substantive Law: It is common ground between the Parties that the Parties’ substantive
rights and obligations are governed by the laws of Grenada, subject to one issue in

regard to the law applicable to the Parties’ Arbitration Agreement.

Arbitration Agreement: As regards the Arbitration Agreement, RSM contended that
Article 26 was governed by the laws of Grenada, pursuant to Article 28 of the
Agreement. As submitted by RSM’s Counsel at the conclusion of the Main Hearing:
“The arbitration clause is part of the contract. I know, of course, we all know the

argument about severability, but we are not concerned here with severability as to

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 10 of 159

whether an arbitration clause is surviving a contract in some way or another, but it is a
clause of the contract, like any other, and it follows from that that it has to be
interpreted according to the applicable law which the parties have expressly chosen”

[D5.205-206].

Grenada submitted by its Counsel, at the conclusion of the Main Hearing, that the
Arbitration Agreement’s applicable law was public international law: “... the law
applicable to the arbitration clause, not because of severability, though severability is
recognised in the ICSID Convention, the law applicable to the arbitration clause,
because that is the mechanism created by a treaty, is public international law. If that

makes a difference or not, I don’t know, but that is the principle” [D5.209-210].

Ultimately, it appeared that this difference was not significant to the Parties’ respective
cases in these arbitration proceedings; and the Tribunal does not consider it significant

to its decisions in this Award.

(05) The Arbitration Tribunal

The Arbitral Tribunal was comprised of three members:

(1) Professor Bernard Audit, as Co-Arbitrator, appointed by RSM by letter
dated 20 September 2005, of Université de Paris II (Panthéon-Assas), 12 place
du Panthéon, 75005 Paris, France;

(2) Dr David S. Berry, as Co-Arbitrator, appointed by Grenada by letter dated
31 October 2005, of the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus, P.O.
Box 64, Bridgetown, Barbados; and

(3) V.V. Veeder Esq, as President, appointed by the two co-arbitrators on 1 December
2005, of Essex Court Chambers, 24 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London WC2E 3EG, United
Kingdom.

Ms Milanka Kostadinova, Senior Counsel, ICSID, was appointed Secretary to
the Tribunal.

writing or in transcripts which are on file at ICSID with copies in the Parties’

possession.

Main Hearing: The Main Hearing took place over five days from Monday, 18 June to
Friday, 22 June 2007, at the IDRC, 70 Fleet Street, London EC4Y 1EU, United

Kingdom. It was recorded by verbatim transcript.'

The Main Hearing was attended, on behalf of RSM, by Arthur Marriot QC, Thomas
Geuther Esq, Zoe Warwick Esq and Joshua Rosenthal Esq (all of LeBoeuf, Lamb,
Greene & MacRae (now Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP)); Me Philippe Auzas (of Grand,
Auzas & Associés); Mr James A.L. Bristol (of Henry, Henry & Bristol); Mr Jack
Grynberg (of RSM) and Mr Richard Ward (also of RSM). It was attended, on behalf of
Grenada , by Jan Paulsson Esq, D. Brian King Esq, Jonathan J. Gass Esq, Laura
Halonen Esq and Fiona Richardson Esq (all of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP);

Senator Gregory Bowen and Mr John Auguste (of the Government of Grenada).

The Parties made oral opening submissions on the Main Hearing’s first day [D1.05 and
D1.89 respectively]. The following witnesses then testified orally at the Main Hearing:
for RSM, Mr Bristol (D1.182x, D1.189xx and D1.230xxx) and Mr Grynberg (D2.05x,
D2.23xx, D3.04xx and D3.129xxx); for Grenada, Mr Auguste (D3.155x, D3.165xx and
D3.244xxx) and Senator Bowen (D4.03x, D4.14xx and D4.87xxx). On the Main
Hearing’s last day, the Parties made closing oral submissions and reply submissions

[D5.03, D5.90, D5.184 and D5.207].

At the end of the Main Hearing, the Tribunal informally closed the file to the Parties,
save as regards stated exceptions relating to transcript corrections and submissions on

costs to be made later in writing [D5.220-221].

' References made to the verbatim transcript below are to the relevant day and page: e.g., “D1.04” indicates

page 4 of the first day (18 June 2007). The bundle references are self-explanatory.

(07) The Parties’ Claims for Relief

27.

28.

RSM: As confirmed at the conclusion of Main Hearing [D5.203-204 & 213-216], RSM
seeks an order from the Tribunal in these terms, as taken from RSM’s Memorial,
Section D, “Prayer for Relief,” paragraphs 98.1 to 98.6 (page 27) and, as re-stated to
like effect in RSM’s Reply, Section D, paragraph 168 (page 88), namely:

“98.1. The Agreement remains in full force and effect;

98.2. The Government must under the Agreement ensure that RSM is granted an
Exploration License;

98.3. In the alternative, the Government must pay damages to RSM for the loss it
has suffered, such damages to be determined following an inquiry as to
damages;

98.4. The Government must not proceed with discussions with third parties
concerning the grant of oil and gas exploration rights within the area subject
to the Agreement and may not award, promise or issue any exploratory or
development rights to any third party which would affect RSM’s rights or
obligations under the Agreement before the Tribunal has issued its award;

98.5. The Government must pay in full the fees and expenses of the Arbitrators, the
ICSID administrative expenses and all costs incurred in connection with this
arbitration by RSM (including without limitation the fees and expenses of all
experts and all legal fees and expenses); and

98.6. RSM is entitled to such further relief as is just and equitable in all the
circumstances of this case.”

As regards the prayer for relief in paragraph 98.4 above, Counsel for RSM
acknowledged at the conclusion of the Main Hearing that it might unnecessarily
duplicate the prayer for relief in paragraph 98.1 [D5.204]. As regards the prayer for
relief in paragraph 98.3, at RSM’s request, the Tribunal indicated at the conclusion of
the Main Hearing that, if this relief were granted, the Tribunal would be minded to hold

a further hearing to conduct the requested “inquiry as to damages” [D5.216].

Grenada: As confirmed at the conclusion of the Main Hearing [D5.211-212], Grenada
seeks an order from the Tribunal in the following terms, as taken from Grenada’s

Counter-Memorial, Section 7, “Request for Relief” (page 183), namely:

11

29.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 14 of 159

“7.1 For the foregoing reasons, Grenada respectfully requests the Arbitral Tribunal to
render an Award:

”
(8)

Declaring that RSM’s claims are not within the jurisdiction of the Arbitral
Tribunal;

Declaring, alternatively, that Grenada has not breached any of its
obligations under the Agreement;

Dismissing all of RSM’s claims;

Declaring that RSM fraudulently induced the Government to enter into the
Agreement, and/or that RSM breached the Agreement;

Declaring, on the basis of the finding described in (4) above, that the
Agreement is rescinded, or alternatively terminated, or lapsed, such that
the Government has no further contractual obligations to RSM;

Ordering RSM on the basis of the finding in (4) above to refrain from: (a)
interfering in any way in Grenada’s foreign policy and relations with other
States; (b) representing to any person or entity that it has authority to act
as an agent or representative of the Government of Grenada; and (c)
asserting to any person or entity that it has any kind of license or other
rights in respect of Grenada’s offshore territory or EEZ;

Awarding to the Government, on the basis of the finding described in (4)
above, the sums of EC$ 391,860.00 and US$1,000.00;

Ordering RSM to pay all costs of this proceeding, including the
Government's legal and expert fees and expenses, the fees and expenses of
the Arbitral Tribunal and of any experts appointed by the Arbitral Tribunal,
as well as the costs charged by ICSID; and

Awarding the Government such other and further relief as the Arbitral
Tribunal may consider appropriate.”

Paragraph 7 of this prayer for relief addresses Grenada’s counterclaims for damages

made earlier in its Counter-Memorial in respect of contractual breaches of the

Agreement alleged against RSM, namely: (a) the sum of EC$ 391, 860.00 as Grenada’s

expense in compensating the fishermen damaged by RSM’s unauthorised research

committed by the “GSI Admiral,” paragraph 6.31 (p. 181); and (b) the sum of

US$1,000 nominal damages for RSM’s alleged failure to submit a timely application

for an Exploration Licence and proceed with its exploration activities, paragraphs 5.19

& 6.32, (pp. 167 & 182). In regard to paragraphs 4 and 5 of the prayer, Grenada makes

no formal claim in damages for tortious misrepresentation.

(08) The New York Legal Proceedings

30.

31.

32.

33.

On 1 November 2006, whilst these arbitration proceedings were pending before ICSID,
RSM (inter alios) filed a complaint in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York against Senator Bowen and three other individuals, raising issues of
corruption against each of them and claiming damages in excess of US $500 million.
These New York legal proceedings received extensive publicity, including materials
from these ICSID proceedings placed in the public domain which do not appear to have

originated from Grenada or Senator Bowen.

Given that Senator Bowen was manifestly an important witness for this Tribunal, it was
at least unfortunate that he felt himself subjected to this litigation by RSM as a means
of placing unfair pressure upon him for one purpose or another. The Tribunal was not
in a position to decide, whether Senator Bowen was right or wrong in his concerns,

which were more appropriately addressed by the New York Court.

Moreover, Senator Bowen was not a party to these ICSID arbitration proceedings; nor
was he separately represented before this Tribunal. Grenada took steps to protect him
by several applications to the Tribunal for interim measures, which were the subject of
several requests by the Tribunal to the Parties up to August 2007 and in turn several

procedural orders and requests made by the Tribunal, as indicated above.

The Tribunal is satisfied that Senator Bowen’s testimony was not adversely affected by
the New York Legal Proceedings. Given the Tribunal’s findings of fact in regard to
Senator Bowen below, it would serve no purpose in this Award to set out here anything

further in regard to those proceedings.

(09) Miscellaneous

34.

At the request of the Tribunal, on 9 July 2007 both Parties filed simultaneously their

submissions on costs.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 16 of 159

Save for the submissions on costs and transcript corrections, the Tribunal made it clear
at the Main Hearing that the record was closed as to the matters before the Tribunal for
its decision as regards any further “submissions or evidence or exhibits or legal

materials” by any Party, as already noted above [D5.221].

On 3 September 2007, RSM submitted an expert report by Mr Thomas Leslie Reeves.
By letter of 6 September 2007, Grenada objected that in view of the Tribunal’s ruling at
the Main Hearing the report should not be considered by the Tribunal. In all the
circumstances, given also the decisions recorded later in this Award, the Tribunal
decided that it is neither appropriate nor necessary to refer to RSM’s additional

materials.

These proceedings were formally closed by the Tribunal under Article 38(1) of the
ICSID Rules, by letter dated 15 January 2009 addressed to the Parties.

By letter from RSM’s Counsel to the Secretary of the Tribunal dated 4 February 2009,
together with Mr Jack J. Grynberg’s further communication, signed per se and dated 10
February 2009, RSM applied for the Tribunal’s permission to introduce into evidence
certain new materials and to re-open these proceedings in accordance with Article 38(2)
of the ICSID Rules. Grenada opposed RSM’s application by a communication dated 6
February 2009 from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP. By its procedural order of
24 February 2009, the Tribunal rejected RSM’s application: the Tribunal considered
that the Parties’ presentation of their respective cases was fully complete as of 15
January 2009 when the Tribunal declared the proceedings formally closed under Article
38(1); and the Tribunal also considered that, in principle, the re-opening of proceedings
under Article 38(2) requires the requesting party to show that the fresh evidence is of
such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor in the case or that there is a significant
need for clarification on certain specific points. In all the circumstances of the present
case and having considered the Parties’ written submissions, the Tribunal did not find
that any ground, as envisaged in Article 38(2), had been shown by RSM to exist for the

Tribunal to justify the re-opening of these proceedings.

PART I: THE PARTIES’ DISPUTE
AND THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES

Introduction

The Tribunal has considered the full submissions of the Parties in identifying the
principal issues and in arriving at the decisions on those issues in this Award. The
summaries listed below are made for the purpose only of explaining the Tribunal’s
approach in this Award and cannot, of course, reproduce the Parties’ fuller submissions
made to the Tribunal, both written and oral, during the course of these arbitration

proceedings.

The Principal Issues

The following principal issues arise from the Claimant’s Claim and the Respondent’s

Counterclaim:

Issue A: The Jurisdiction Issue

There arises first of all the issue of jurisdiction, which depends on whether this dispute
arises directly from an Ainvestment@ within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention. Subject to this question, there is no dispute that the Arbitration Agreement
is a valid and subsisting agreement to arbitrate under its applicable law or laws,

conferring jurisdiction upon this Tribunal to decide the merits of the Parties’ dispute.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 18 of 159

(i) The Claimant’s Case

The Claimant advances its case for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction upon the Parties’
Arbitration Agreement in the Agreement, as a private law agreement subject to the law
of Grenada. This Arbitration Agreement was consensually negotiated and agreed
between the Parties before other terms of the Agreement, Grenada having put forward
the Commonwealth Fund’s model contract which contained an ICSID arbitration clause
and RSM having proposed its draft production sharing contract which also contained an

ICSID arbitration clause.

As regards the Respondent’s case based on Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the
Claimant asserts that its “investment” is manifest on the facts of the present case.
Moreover, RSM has already invested approximately US $6 million between 1971 and
1984 (in addition to Mr Grynberg’s and RSM’s own work and know-how), quite apart
from the assumption of contractual obligations under the Agreement amounting to

further investment.

The unreality of Grenada’s position is increased by the fact that the Agreement
envisages a 58-year hydrocarbon exploration concession which inevitably becomes a
large infrastructure project in Grenada. If Grenada’s oil and natural gas reserves are as
large as RSM believes them to be, the Agreement would result eventually in the largest
investment and infrastructure project in Grenada’s history. Since Grenada’s annual
gross national income is only US $370 million, Grenada’s annual tax revenues and
royalties under the Agreement would result in a massive increase of the Government’s
annual income for the benefit of Grenada as a whole. The Agreement would also

provide employment and training for large numbers of Grenadian citizens.

Moreover, Article 26.3(a) of the Agreement records Grenada’s express acceptance that
RSM is “an investor” and express consent to ICSID arbitration, as invoked in this case.
When the present dispute arose, Grenada reiterated its consent to ICSID arbitration and
confirmed to RSM that it would honour the award of an ICSID tribunal. It is therefore
difficult to imagine a more compelling case for the assertion of jurisdiction by any

ICSID tribunal.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 19 of 159

There can therefore be no doubt that the Agreement evidences an investment, rather
than an ordinary commercial transaction such as the sale of goods contract in Joy
Mining Machinery Ltd v Egypt. In that case, the tribunal decided that a global approach
should be adopted under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and accepted that certain
classes of activity qualify “beyond doubt” as an investment under Article 25, citing
contracts containing express consent to ICSID arbitration and concession contracts (at

paragraph 59):

“The Tribunal is aware of many ICSID and other arbitral decisions noted above and
the fact that they have progressively given a broader meaning to the concept of
investment. But in all those cases there was a specific connection to ICSID, either
because the activity in question was beyond doubt an investment or because there was
an arbitration clause involved. The same holds true of concession contracts in which
the investor is called on to perform a public service on behalf of the State.”

(The Claimant also cited, principally, the decisions in Joy Mining v Egypt, CSOB v The
Slovak Republic (at paragraphs 63-64, citing the Report of the Executive Directors of
the World Bank on the ICSID Convention), and the ad hoc Committee decision in

Mitchell v DRC (at paragraph 30)).
(ii) The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent submits that this jurisdictional issue depends on whether this dispute
arises directly from an “investment” within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention; and that, if the Tribunal should determine that it has no jurisdiction
because there is no such investment on the facts of this case, there would be no need for
the Tribunal to resolve any of the substantive issues regarding RSM’s claims or
Grenada’s counterclaims. Given that jurisdiction has here been merged with the merits,
this jurisdictional issue requires all relevant facts to be decisively determined on the
evidence, with no assumptions in favour of RSM as the Claimant asserting jurisdiction

(as might be appropriate at the preliminary stage of ICSID arbitration proceedings).

48. The ICSID Convention establishes an objective jurisdictional standard that is either met
or not met, on the established facts. Parties cannot by agreement or waiver confer
jurisdiction on an ICSID Tribunal outside the scope of Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention. The so-called Salini factors are well-established requirements for
establishing the existence of an “investment” for the purposes of Article 25; and in

applying them, the facts of each case must be considered as a whole.

49. As the ICSID award in MHS v Malaysia and the Mitchell v DRC ICSID annulment
decision emphasized, a significant contribution to the host state’s economic
development is a cardinal feature of an “investment” in light of the purposes and
objects of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent relied upon a string of jurisdictional
decisions in recent years to such effect, namely: Salini v Morocco, Mihaly v Sri Lanka,
Joy Mining v Egypt, LETCO v Algeria, LESI v Algeria, Mitchell v DRC, CSOB v
Slovakia, Bayandir v Pakistan, Jan de Nul NV v Egypt, Autopista Concesionada de
Venezuela v Venezuela, Nagel v Czech Republic and MHS v Malaysia.*

50. RSM’s account of what constitutes its “investment” for jurisdictional purposes has
varied considerably during these proceedings. One common element among these

variations is that RSM’s alleged financial contributions are almost entirely unsupported

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 21 of 159

by documentary evidence. Taking all of RSM’s claimed investment activities as a

whole, they fail to meet, or at best meet only weakly, the various Salini factors.

For example, RSM has taken great care to minimize its financial commitment and to
ensure that any significant operations would be undertaken by others without any risk
to RSM. Further, RSM’s minimal activities did not contribute in any significant way to
Grenada’s economic development. One category of expenditure claimed by RSM as an
“investment” is the alleged expense incurred in undertaking various litigation and
arbitration claims for the benefit of Grenada. None of these claims has succeeded; most
were undertaken over Grenada’s objections; and all were meritless on their face. RSM
has also claimed to have acquired and reprocessed seismic data. The amounts claimed
to have been spent have not been supported by any documentary evidence; and, in any
case, RSM’s activity has been de minimis in the context of petroleum exploration. Even
if the jurisdictional test could be satisfied by what RSM had undertaken to do under the
Agreement (rather than by what it has actually done), its obligations under the
Agreement would not suffice to qualify as an “investment” under Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention: the most that RSM was obliged to do was a trivial amount of work

costing US $400,000.

In the words of its Counsel at the Main Hearing, Grenada submitted that: “At the
highest, they [RSM] were the putative beneficiary of a preliminary agreement which we
submit cannot itself constitute an investment. Did this preliminary investment contain,
comport, carry with it, an investment between its signature and the invocation of force
majeure? That ... is a window of 14 days. Where was the investment during that time

frame?” [D1.97].

As noted above, however, it is not Grenada’s case that the Arbitration Agreement was
invalid or non-existent or otherwise contractually ineffective by itself. As submitted by
its Counsel in Grenada’s closing oral submissions at the Main Hearing: “In this case,
we are not saying that the arbitration clause was an illusion. Our client signed it.”
[D5.154]. Grenada’s case turns only upon the “illusory nature” of RSM’s investment
under the “self-limiting” Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, as a result of which

Article 26 of the Parties’ Agreement is “pathological, because you could not use the

ICSID mechanism for what would, in effect, be an issue of the interpretation of a
document which is not relevant to an investment. You cannot use ICSID for that.”

[D5.212].

Issue B: Removal of Force Majeure

This issue addresses whether RSM violated Article 4.2 of the Agreement by interfering
with the resolution of Grenada’s maritime boundaries. Article 4.2 of the Agreement
required RSM “to take all reasonable steps to remove the cause” of force majeure. It
also addresses whether Grenada bore a like obligation towards RSM and, if so, whether
Grenada was in breach of this obligation. (Article 4.2 is cited in full below in Part III(2)
of this Award).

fi) The Respondent’s Case

RSM’s continuing interference in Grenada’s boundary negotiations with its neighbours,
in spite of repeated and explicit warnings that RSM’s conduct was endangering the
prospect of a successful conclusion to such negotiations, violated its obligation to act
reasonably to resolve an alleged event of force majeure under Article 24.2 of the
Agreement. That contractual breach entitled Grenada to terminate the Agreement under

the law of Grenada.

(ii) The Claimants’ Case

RSM did not guarantee that it would succeed in resolving Grenada’s boundary disputes
with Venezuela and Trinidad & Tobago. Even if, as Grenada asserts, RSM’s acts
temporarily antagonised Venezuelan officials, RSM’s conduct does not mean that
resolution of the boundary disputes became impossible or even that such resolution was
substantially delayed. Boundary negotiations can be slow and difficult. As Grenada’s
own Counter-Memorial admits, as regards Venezuela, “the slow progress of the
negotiations has been largely due to Venezuela”; and, as regards Trinidad & Tobago,

Grenada admits that “the coming into force of UNCLOS in 1994 has apparently put

20

(05)

59.

60.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 23 of 159

Trinidad & Tobago in a difficult position, such that it is reluctant to hold substantive

discussions regarding the boundary, let alone to agree on a line [with Grenada].”

RSM also relied upon Mr Auguste’s testimony where he explained that political events
in Venezuela and Trinidad & Tobago were responsible for Grenada’s difficulties: the
former’s attempted coup in 2002 and the latter’s constitutional crisis due to the 2000

and 2001 elections resulting a hung parliament [WS2, paragraph 28].

It is therefore impossible, on the evidence, for Grenada to prove that anything which
RSM is alleged to have done has caused Grenada to become unable to resolve its
boundary disputes. In any event, RSM’s efforts to resolve these boundary disputes do
not amount to breach of any condition of the Agreement under the law of Grenada. Nor,
given Grenada’s express admissions as to the reasons for the lack of progress in its
boundary negotiations, can Grenada prove that the alleged breaches by RSM caused
Grenada to lose “substantially the whole benefit” which Grenada expected under the
Agreement. Accordingly, even if there were a breach of the Agreement by RSM, it was
inconsequential; and termination of the Agreement by Grenada is not therefore
permitted under Grenadian law. To the contrary, Grenada was in breach of its

contractual obligation towards RSM.

Issue C: Expiry or Termination

This issue addresses the principal claim and counterclaim of the Parties, depending
upon the timeliness and effect of RSM’s application for an Exploration Licence under
Article 3.1 of the Agreement. (Article 3.1 is cited in full below in Part III(2) of this
Award).

fi) The Claimants’ Case

The Agreement gave to RSM the right to receive an Exploration Licence to explore for

oil and natural gas throughout Grenada’s entire maritime territory. Before signing the

21

62.

63.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 24 of 159

Agreement on 4 July 1996, RSM and Grenada knew that Grenada’s boundary disputes
with both Venezuela and Trinidad & Tobago would make hydrocarbon exploration and
production operations difficult or impossible in the most promising parts of the
concession area. Article 24.4 of the Agreement, containing an express ‘deeming’
provision relating specifically to the boundary disputes, was thus inserted by the Parties
into the Agreement to protect RSM’s rights and to extend the Agreement by the period
required to overcome an existing force majeure event at the time the Agreement was
made. Both RSM and Grenada then proceeded for eight years on the footing that
RSM’s obligation to apply for an Exploration Licence had been suspended from 4 July
1996 onwards. During those eight years RSM sought to overcome the force majeure
event. By early 2004, RSM considered that the risk of serious difficulties arising from
exploration operations had been reduced to the point that exploration could begin; and
RSM therefore submitted its application for an Exploration Licence under Article 3.1 of

the Agreement to Grenada’s Ministry of Finance on 13 April 2004.

Instead of issuing an Exploration Licence, in breach of the Agreement, Grenada
purported to terminate the Agreement on the basis that RSM’s licence application was a

few days out of time.

Under Article 24.2 of the Agreement, RSM was required promptly to notify the
Government of the force majeure event; and it did so by its letter dated 18 July 1996.
That does not change the fact that its obligations had already been suspended as of 4
July 1996. RSM’s obligations remained suspended from 4 July 1996 until 13 January

2004, upon Grenada’s receipt of RSM’s letter revoking force majeure.

There can be no doubt that Article 24.4 of the Agreement, validly invoked as regards
force majeure by RSM on 18 July 1996 with the written consent of Grenada, suspended
all of RSM’s obligations under the Agreement, including its obligation to apply for a
Exploration Licence. Grenada’s argument to the contrary is wholly at odds with the
plain language of Articles 3.1 and 24.4 of the Agreement and with the entirety of the
Parties’ conduct between 1996 and 2004.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 25 of 159

RSM’s licence application was received by Grenada on 13 April 2004. Even if this
means that RSM’s licence application was one or more days late, the presumption
under English and Grenadian law, to the effect that contractual time stipulations are
generally not of the essence, means that Grenada cannot terminate the Agreement or
avoid its contractual duty to grant to RSM an Exploration Licence under the

Agreement.

Moreover, the letter in which RSM revoked its force majeure declaration is dated 12
January 2004, but RSM’s facsimile transmission confirmation form indicates that it was
not transmitted to and received by Grenada until 13 January 2004, between 1434 and
1456 hours. The ninetieth day after 13 January 2004 was Monday, 12 April 2004. That
day was Easter Monday; and the preceding Friday was Good Friday, on both of which
days all Government offices in Grenada were closed (including the weekend).
Accordingly, RSM’s application was delivered to the appropriate Government officials
on the first working day after 12 April 2004 on which delivery could be effected, i-e.,
13 April 2004.

Delivery by RSM of the application to the Government by, for example, facsimile
transmission on 12 April 2004 would have been futile, because on that Easter Monday
the Ministry of Finance’s offices were closed, meaning that the Minister of Energy
would have been incapable of issuing an Exploration Licence on that day to the
Claimant. In such circumstances, where two parties must both do acts on a day on
which the acts cannot be done because that day is a public holiday, the relevant time

period should be extended until the next business day.

RSM’s licence application was therefore made in good time under the Agreement. At

the very worst, it was delivered only one day late.

In the alternative, RSM maintains that its first letter withdrawing the force majeure
declaration dated 12 January 2004 was ineffective because it was sent to the Office of
the Prime Minister of Grenada, rather than to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry
of Finance. Under Article 29.1(a) of the Agreement, the correct address for the delivery
of notices to the Government was that of the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of

Finance. Accordingly, RSM’s force majeure declaration was not validly withdrawn

23

69.

70.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 26 of 159

until 27 February 2004, when RSM submitted a fresh notice under Article 24.3 of the
Agreement correctly addressed, this time, to the Ministry of Finance. The ninety-day
period under Article 3.1 therefore began to run again on 27 February 2004 only and did
not expire until 26 May 2004. RSM’s application for an Exploration Licence, even if
not received by Grenada until 14 April 2004 (rather than 13 April 2004), was therefore

received in good time under Article 3.1 of the Agreement.

In any event, as already submitted, time was not of the essence under Article 3.1 of the
Agreement, as interpreted under the law of Grenada. The Agreement does not provide
that compliance with the ninety-day time period for filing a licence application by RSM
is a condition or condition precedent to Grenada’s duty to grant an Exploration Licence
to RSM. RSM and Grenada always knew that RSM’s licence application would be
submitted much later than ninety days after 4 July 1996 because the two boundary
disputes had to be resolved before exploration could begin by RSM; and, therefore, any
delay of one, two or even seventeen days by RSM could cause no conceivable prejudice
to Grenada. Such a delay did not permit Grenada to terminate the Agreement or to
relieve Grenada of its obligation under Article 3.1 of the Agreement to grant an

Exploration Licence to RSM.

(ii) The Respondent’s Case

According to the Respondent, the question here is whether Grenada was contractually
obliged in April 2004 to issue an Exploration License to RSM, which raises in turn
several sub-issues, namely (a) whether either force majeure suspended the running of
the ninety-day period under Article 3.1 of the Agreement for RSM to apply for an
Exploration License in good time or whether Grenada is estopped from denying that it
did not; (b) if neither of these sub-issues is established in RSM’s favour (as Grenada
submits), whether RSM’s application was made late, whether or not the ninety-day
limit is considered to be “of the essence” or a condition precedent (as Grenada
submits); and (c) if so, whether that delay beyond ninety days relieved Grenada of the
contractual obligation to grant a license or entitled Grenada to treat the Agreement as

lapsed or terminated (as Grenada also submits).

73.

74.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 27 of 159

Article 3.1 of the Agreement required RSM to apply for, and Grenada to grant, an
Exploration License “as soon as possible, and in no event later than 90 days” after
signing the Agreement. The only logical interpretation of this contractual wording is
that RSM must first make the application before Grenada must grant it as a bilateral
transaction, i.e., that RSM’s applying was a condition precedent to Grenada’s
obligation to grant the application. The question is thus whether RSM’s making the

application in timely fashion is part of that condition precedent.

Grenada submits that the express contractual obligation on RSM to apply “in no event
later than” a date certain should be interpreted as a condition precedent to Grenada’s
obligation to grant the application for an Exploration Licence. The situation is closely
analogous to the grant of an option, where the grantor has a clear and legitimate interest
in certainty as to when its property is free of an encumbrance. Moreover, virtually all of
both Parties’ obligations under the Agreement depend upon the grant of this initial
Exploration License. Accordingly, the fact that the obligation of Grenada to grant such
license never arose (as a result of the failure of a condition precedent) means that the

entire Agreement lapsed.

In the alternative, Grenada contends that RSM’s breach of its obligation to submit an
application timeously under Article 3.1 entitled Grenada to terminate the Agreement, as
it did by letter dated 5 July 2005: in the terminology of the common law (applicable in
Grenada), the obligation to apply for a license in timely manner was a condition of the

Agreement.

RSM has proposed various methods for counting the ninety-day period. To try to come
in within the contractual timetable, RSM has changed its position several times as to the
dates on which it “revoked force majeure” and delivered its application to Grenada. On
the other hand, Grenada has taken a consistent view as to the proper methodology for
counting the ninety-day period, commencing with Senator Bowen’s letter dated 27
April 2004 informing RSM that its application had been denied by Grenada as
untimely. Notwithstanding RSM’s varying theories, Grenada has set forth calculations
showing that, on any plausible view, more than ninety days elapsed before RSM

submitted its application for an Exploration Licence. Thus, RSM’s application was

25

75.

76.

77.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 28 of 159

untimely irrespective of whether force majeure suspended the ninety-day period, as
RSM claims (including for the fourteen days between the signing of the Agreement and

RSM’s giving notice of force majeure).

In any event, force majeure did not suspend the ninety-day period under the
Agreement. Article 24 requires that for a party to be excused from performing an
obligation, the event of force majeure must cause the party to be unable to perform that
obligation. This is common sense; and it is also the ordinary understanding of the force
majeure concept. RSM’s contrary argument is based entirely on one sentence in Article
24.4, but that sentence does not say what RSM would have it say. By its terms, it
applies only to obligations that arise after an Exploration License has been granted by
Grenada; and, by definition, it cannot affect the obligation of RSM to apply for that

license.

RSM’s interpretation also leads to a number of absurdities. First, according to RSM, if
there is boundary uncertainty in any part of Grenada’s territory that RSM has already
“given up” upon applying for a license renewal, all of RSM’s obligations are
nonetheless suspended. Next, RSM’s case grants to itself the unilateral right to both
suspend and reactivate both Parties’ obligations whenever RSM wishes to advance or
postpone force majeure conditions, a power that no rational contracting party would

give to its counterparty in this kind of transaction.

Lastly, Grenada is not estopped from insisting on the proper interpretation of the
Agreement. The Parties are agreed that estoppel by convention under the law of
Grenada, being the equitable doctrine invoked by RSM, requires RSM to establish that
the Parties shared a common misunderstanding. RSM has not established, and cannot
establish on the evidential materials, that essential element required by the law of
Grenada. Moreover, RSM believed it already had a license, a mistaken view never held

by the Government of Grenada.

Issue D: The Claimant’s Relief

This issue relates to the claim for relief made by RSM, assuming its application for an
Exploration Licence was wrongly refused by Grenada in breach of Article 3.1 of the
Agreement. (The relief claimed by RSM is set out above, at paragraph 27 in Part I of
this Award.)

(i) The Claimants’ Case

RSM estimates its loss in excess of US $500 million. Given Grenada’s inability to
satisfy a damages award in excess of US $500 million and the unique rights over
territory conferred by the Agreement, RSM submits that damages as such would plainly
be an inadequate remedy for RSM in this case; that there is therefore a strong
presumption in favour of a declaration in lieu of specific performance; and that RSM is
entitled to a declaration in lieu of specific performance under the law of Grenada. RSM
is not seeking an order for specific performance against Grenada, as RSM’s Counsel
expressly confirmed during his closing oral submissions at the Main Hearing [D5.79 &

82].

As regards specific performance and declaratory relief, RSM accepts that Grenada’s
Crown Proceedings Act 1959 (the “1959 Act”) governs the Tribunal’s remedial powers

in this arbitration in regard to the Agreement.

Section 17(1)(a) of the 1959 Act provides as follows:

“[W]here in any proceedings against the Crown any such relief is sought as might in
proceedings between subjects be granted by way of injunction or specific performance,
the court shall not grant any injunction or make an order for specific performance, but
may in lieu thereof make an order declaratory of the rights of the parties; ...”

83.

84.

85.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 30 of 159

Accordingly, being thus deprived of the natural remedy of specific performance in this
case, RSM claims a declaratory order in lieu of specific performance under the 1959
Act. Grenada’s attempt to resist a declaratory order in lieu of specific performance
under Section 17(1)(a) of the 1959 Act by reliance on principles of public international
law is misconceived, given the Agreement’s applicable law. It would mean that RSM’s
remedies in these ICSID proceedings would be more limited than if RSM were

pursuing its claim before a Grenadian state court.

Grenada’s further argument that a declaration in lieu of specific performance should not
be granted because Grenada is a sovereign state is misconceived. The express purpose
of Section 17(1)(a) of the 1959 Act, in furtherance of the fundamental principle under
Grenadian constitutional law of equality before the law between the Crown and its
subjects, is to place Grenada in the same position as its citizens. Moreover, Grenada’s

Rejoinder concedes that this Tribunal has the power to make such a declaration.

RSM is accordingly entitled to a declaration that Grenada should comply with the

Agreement and grant to RSM an Exploration Licence forthwith.

(ii) The Respondent’s Case

If the Tribunal concludes that Grenada breached the Agreement, Grenada submits that
questions regarding causation arise, namely (a) whether, as a matter of law, RSM is
required to prove that Grenada’s breach caused any harm to RSM; (b) if so, whether
RSM has satisfied that burden of proof in this case; and (c) if so, whether RSM should
be granted specific performance or a declaratory order in lieu of specific performance,

or money damages.

If (which Grenada denies) RSM is entitled to relief for any contractual breach by
Grenada, the Tribunal should limit such relief to money damages, if any, that RSM can
actually prove on the evidence adduced in these proceedings that it has suffered as a
result of such contractual breach. RSM, however, has deliberately declined to adduce in
this case any cogent evidence regarding its losses, notwithstanding the Tribunal’s

procedural orders and other repeated requests by Grenada.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 31 of 159

Grenada disputes RSM’s entitlement to specific performance, as being impermissible
under Section 17(1)(a) of the Crown Proceedings 1959 Act. It notes that no such relief

is now being claimed by RSM in this case.

Grenada also disputes RSM’s entitlement to any declaration in lieu of specific
performance under the 1959 Act, both in principle and as a matter of discretion. It
submits that the overwhelming body of international precedent and commentary
militates strongly against declaring that a state is obliged to permit a private party to
extract the state’s natural resources. Indeed, under international law, even if RSM had a
right to an Exploration License, Grenada could terminate that right upon payment of

compensation for lawful expropriation, i.e., money damages.

Under Grenadian law, the considerations that have guided courts in exercising their
equitable discretion whether or not to grant declaratory judgments reinforce the
conclusion that such relief would be inappropriate in this case. Such considerations
include, for example, public policy, the balance between the utility of the declaration,
the inconvenience and embarrassment it would cause and the probability (or

improbability) that the declaration will put an end to the dispute.

Issue E: Misrepresentation

This issue addresses whether RSM made unlawful misrepresentations that induced
Grenada to enter into the Agreement, entitling Grenada to rescind the Agreement under

the law of Grenada.
(i) The Respondent’s Case
RSM’s post-contractual conduct has made plain that RSM’s intentions from the outset

were not as RSM had represented them to Grenada before the Agreement. RSM then

represented itself as willing, able and eager to carry out exploration and development as

29

91.

92.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 32 of 159

envisaged by the intended Agreement. RSM’s plan, to the contrary, was to lock up
Grenada’s territory until the Agreement could be “farmed out” to another company or
companies; and those “farminees” would do all of the work, pay all of the costs and
take all of the risk: i.e., they would “carry” RSM’s interest. RSM thus induced Grenada
to enter into the Agreement on materially false premises, including the presentation of
itself as an “operator” experienced in maritime boundary negotiations (with its own
financial resources sufficient to fulfil its obligations towards the Respondent) and not a
mere “broker”; and Grenada is therefore entitled to rescind the Agreement for

fraudulent misrepresentation under the law of Grenada.

(ii) The Claimant’s Case

The Claimant first submits that allegations of misrepresentation and fraud must be
particularised and specific in an ICSID arbitration, which is not the case advanced by
Grenada. The Claimant contends that Grenada’s allegations remain defectively
generalised and unduly vague in these arbitration proceedings. Moreover, the Claimant
points out that Grenada’s allegations of misrepresentation had never been
communicated to RSM before receipt of Grenada’s Counter-Memorial in December
2006 during these arbitration proceedings, more than ten years after the
misrepresentations were allegedly made and allegedly relied on by Grenada. This delay

speaks for itself.

Secondly, as to what is pleaded, Grenada alleges that Mr Grynberg stated at one point
in the negotiations preceding the Agreement that his children’s money would be
invested in RSM. Grenada alleges that it was never RSM’s intention to invest any
meaningful amount of its own money (or even Mr Grynberg’s money). These factual
premises are false: RSM and its affiliates expended US$ 6 million to acquire and
process seismic data for the project; neither RSM nor its agents ever represented to
Grenada that RSM would not seek funding from third parties for its activities under the
Agreement; nor did they ever represent to Grenada that RSM would not seek to assign

its rights under the Agreement.

(09)

96.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 33 of 159

Indeed, Article 23.1(a) of the Agreement expressly permits RSM to enter into loan
agreements to fund its operations; Article 25 expressly permits RSM to assign its rights
and obligations under the Agreement, either wholly or in part, provided that Grenada
does not have reasonable grounds for withholding consent; and Article 1.1(i) of the
Agreement makes it expressly clear that RSM may assign “its participating interest or
any part thereof...” Moreover, before the Agreement’s execution, Mr Grynberg
informed Grenada that he intended to seek additional partners for the Agreement’s
performance. As to maritime boundary negotiations, although RSM offered the
assistance of Mr Grynberg in Grenada’s negotiations with Trinidad & Tobago and
Venezuela respectively, such negotiations could not be successfully achieved by any
individual acting alone but obviously required the consent of the states concerned; and
the primary reason for the failure of Grenada’s boundary negotiations resulted from the

adverse attitudes of Trinidad & Tobago and Venezuela.

Issue F: Licence Application

This issue is whether RSM breached its obligation to apply for a license in a timely
manner, in violation of Article 3.1 of the Agreement. As already noted, Grenada claims
only nominal damages in the sum of US $1,000 under this counterclaim. (Article 3 is

cited in full below in Part III(2) of this Award).

The Tribunal addresses this counterclaim as part of the issue relating to the lapse or

termination of the Agreement, namely Issue C above.

Issue G: Detailed Work Plan

The issue, as originally advanced by Grenada, was whether RSM breached its

obligation to submit a detailed work plan under Article 6.1 of the Agreement, thereby

31

ay

98.

99.

100.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 34 of 159

entitling Grenada to terminate the Agreement. Grenada’s Rejoinder also counterclaims
nominal damages if Grenada cannot terminate the Agreement. (Article 6.1 is cited in

full below in Part III(2) of this Award).

The Parties’ respective cases are succinctly pleaded. RSM denies any breach of the
Agreement and any relief to Grenada, even assuming its own contractual breach.

Grenada counterclaims liability for a breach by RSM and appropriate relief.

Issue H: Unauthorised Research

This issue addresses whether RSM violated Grenadian law and the Agreement in
February 2004 by conducting research in Grenada’s waters without permission from the
Grenadian authorities, in violation of Section 4 of the 1989 Act (cited in full below in

Part III(3) of this Award, paragraph 128, page 40).

(i) The Respondent’s Case

RSM deliberately violated Grenadian statutory law and international law in February
2004, when RSM caused a vessel to enter Grenadian waters and conduct seismic
research without permission. Such action violated Article 4 of the 1989 Act; and it also
breached the Agreement. The obligation for RSM to apply for (and the Government to
grant) an Exploration Licence would not make sense if the Agreement permitted RSM
to conduct exploration without a license, or at least express permission in accordance
with Grenada’s legislation. Indeed, RSM had earlier applied and obtained such
permission for earlier seismic research; it knew that such permission was required; and

it also knew that it had no permission in February 2004.

The damage to the long lines of Grenadian fishermen from this vessel’s unauthorised

activities was considerable, costing the Grenadian Government EC$ 381,860.00.

32

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 35 of 159

(ii) The Claimant’s Case

101. RSM notes that this allegation had never been communicated by Grenada to RSM
before receipt of Grenada’s Counter-Memorial in December 2006.
102. Grenada had granted RSM permission to conduct seismic exploration work on previous

occasions. As regards this incident, RSM agrees that it directed the “GSI Admiral” to
conduct a seismic survey in Grenadian waters in February 2004. However, contrary to
the Grenada’s case, Mr Grynberg for RSM notified Mr Auguste for Grenada of this
event and obtained his authorisation for the survey work, as confirmed both by Mr
Grynberg’s letters to Mr Auguste and by Mr Grynberg’s testimony in these arbitration

proceedings.

103. In any event, the voyage of the “GSI Admiral” did not amount to breach of any
condition of the Agreement under the law of Grenada; nor did it amount to a breach of
contract depriving Grenada of substantially the whole benefit of the Agreement. Under
the law of Grenada, termination of the Agreement is not permitted even if there was a
misunderstanding between Messrs Grynberg and Auguste resulting in a minor breach of

the Agreement by RSM.
104. In any event, even if there was a violation by RSM of the laws of Grenada, such a

violation cannot simply be translated into a contractual breach of the Agreement or

other civil wrong actionable by Grenada.

(11) Issue I: Respondent’s Relief

105. Ifany of the matters alleged by the Respondent in its Counterclaim has been

the Tribunal has set out above the principal issues comprising the Parties’ substantive
dispute, briefly summarising their respective cases. As appears below, however, it is

Parties’ dispute. Accordingly, the Tribunal proceeds to consider and decide only the

relevant issues for its decisions in this Award.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 37 of 159

PART IIT: THE PRINCIPAL TEXTS

(01) Introduction

109. It is necessary here to set out relevant extracts from the two principal texts to which

reference is made later below: namely the Parties’ Agreement and the 1989 Act.

(02) The Parties’ Agreement

110. The Agreement was made on 4 July 1996 between the Claimant as “the Company”
represented by Mr Max Flaxman and the Respondent represented by Senator Patrick
Bubb, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Grenada. The
Agreement’s effective date was 4 July 1996, being contractually defined as the date on

which the Agreement was signed by the Parties: Article 1.1(p).

111.

Preamble: The Preamble referred to an area described and shown in Annexes A and B
as being subject to “the entire ownership of, and control over, petroleum vested in the

Government”; and, after referring to the 1989 Act, it continued:

“Whereas the Company intends to apply for a Development Licence over the area
described in Annex A and shown on the map in Annex B hereof and the Government
intends to grant the said licence, and

Whereas the Company intends in the event of a commercial discovery to apply for a
Development Licence or licences and to develop, produce, process, transport, sell,
export or otherwise dispose of the said Petroleum, and

Whereas Section 6 of the [1989] Act authorises the Minister to enter into an agreement
with any person in respect of the grant of a licence, the condition to be included in a
Licence or any matter incidental to or connected with the grant of a Licence under the
Act, and

Whereas the Company has for the purposes aforesaid the necessary financial
capability, technical competence and professional skill.”

Article 1: Article 1.1 of the Agreement, “Definitions,” provided (inter alia):

(a) An ‘Affiliate’ or ‘Affiliated Company’, in relation to any person constituting the
Company, means any Company holding directly or indirectly a majority of shares
in such person or any Company which is controlled directly or indirectly by any
such aforesaid company ...

The ‘Company’ means RSM Production Corporation and includes any other person
to whom the Company has assigned its participating interest or any part thereof in
the Exploration Licence referred to in Article 3 or in any Development Licence
granted under Article 8.

G

>

Article 2: Article 2 of the Agreement provided:

“This Agreement constitutes an agreement made under Section 6 of the [1989] Act.”

. Article 3: Article 3 of the Agreement, “Exploration Licence,” provided:

“3.1 As soon as possible but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the Effective
Date, the Company shall apply for, and the Minister, under and in accordance with the
Act, will grant to the Company an Exploration Licence over the area described in
Annex A and shown on the map in Annex B. This Licence shall be substantially in the
form of the draft licence set forth in Annex C.”

“3.2 The Exploration Licence granted pursuant to Article 3 hereof shall be for an
initial period of four years commencing from the date of the grant of the License and
shall, subject to the Act, on application duly made by the Company, be renewed for two
further periods of two years each in accordance with the Act.”

As earlier noted, the “Effective Date” is defined as 4 July 1996. The form of the Draft
Exploration Licence to be granted by the Minister was indeed set out in Annex C, a
single page with only two dates to be completed together with the signature of the

Minister.

“As soon as possible but in no event later than ...”: As appears later in this Award,
these are the crucial words at issue in Article 3.1 of the Agreement requiring

interpretation and application by the Tribunal in this arbitration.

It was suggested by RSM’s Counsel during his closing oral submissions that, to make
time of the essence or to create a condition precedent to a timely application for an
Exploration Licence, it would be necessary to add expressly: “It is a condition
precedent of this agreement that the notice be filed within 90 days” or “it is a condition
of this agreement” [D5.76]. As regards the number of days, no distinction is drawn

between working days and holidays in the Agreement.

Article 5: Article 5 provided for the establishment of an Advisory Committee “as soon

as possible” after the Effective Date. It was never, in fact, established by the Parties.

Article 6: Article 6.1 of the Agreement, “Work Programme and Budget,” provided:

“Within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date or such further period as may be
allowed by the Minister, the Company shall prepare and submit to the Minister a
detailed work programme and Budget setting forth the Exploration operations which
the Company proposes to carry out in the Calendar year in which the Exploration
Licence is granted to the Company under Article 3 and the estimated cost thereof.”

Article 9: Article 9 of the Agreement provided that the Development Licence “shall be
granted” for a period of thirty years and “may, on application made by the Company”
be renewed for a further period of twenty years.

Article 12: Article 12 of the Agreement addressed royalties and corporation profits tax.
Article 23: Article 23.1 of the Agreement granted the right to “the Company” [...] “to
enter into loan agreements outside Grenada for the purpose of financing Petroleum

Operations hereunder ....”

Article 19: Article 19 of the Agreement addressed Employment and Training.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 40 of 159

Article 24: Article 24 of the Parties’ Agreement, “Force Majeure,” provided (here

divided into lettered sub-paragraphs for ease of reference below):

“24.1 [A] Failure on the part of the Company to fulfil any of the terms and conditions
of this Agreement shall not be treated as breach of this Agreement in so far as the
failure arises from force majeure and [B] if, as a result of force majeure, the fulfilment
by the Company of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement is delayed beyond
the period fixed or allowed for its fulfilment, the period of the delay shall be added to
the duration of this Agreement and to the period so fixed or allowed.”

“24.2 [A] Where the Company seeks to invoke Clause 24.1 it shall promptly notify the
Government in writing of the occurrence of conditions of force majeure and shall take
all reasonable steps to remove the cause thereof. [B] The Company shall promptly
notify the Government as soon as conditions of force majeure no longer prevent the
Company from carrying out its obligations and following such notice shall resume
Petroleum Operations as soon as reasonably practicable.”

“24.3 Where a force majeure situation continues for more than thirty (30) consecutive
days, the parties shall meet forthwith in order to review the situation and to agree on
the measures to be taken for the removal of the cause of force majeure and for the
resumption, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, of the performance of
the obligations hereunder.”

“24.4 [A] In this Article the expression “force majeure” means any event beyond the
reasonable control of the party claiming to be affected by such event which has not
been brought about at its instance and which has caused such non-performance or
delay in performance, including, without limitation, market prices for Petroleum or the
anticipated products of Petroleum which, after taking into account estimated Royalties,
corporate profits tax payments, and production, processing, transportation and all
other costs of every type and all other costs of every type and nature, would not afford
a reasonable profit to the Company; natural phenomena or calamities; epidemics;
fires; wars; invasions; blockades; riots; strikes; insurrections; labour disturbances;
acts of God; inevitable accidents; and any adverse claim or dispute as to the
Government's ownership of, or control over, the petroleum in any portion of the
Agreement Area. [B] For the avoidance of doubt, an adverse claim or dispute relating
to the Government's ownership of or control over the petroleum in any portion of the
Agreement Area shall be deemed a force majeure situation as to the entire Agreement
Area, thereby excusing performance of all of the Company’s obligation under this
Agreement and extending the duration of this Agreement and the period allowed for the
performance or fulfilment of all such obligations by the period required to establish
beyond doubt the Government’s ownership of, and control over, all petroleum in the
entire area described in Appendix A and shown on the Map in Appendix B.””

The Tribunal notes, particularly, the wording in Article 24.4 [B]: this is a clear albeit

unstated reference to Grenada’s boundary difficulties with Venezuela and Trinidad &

38

Tobago; and, as here expressed, an adverse claim or dispute as to any portion of the

area was to qualify as a force majeure event as to the entire area under the Agreement.

Article 25: Article 25 of the Agreement, “Assignment,” provided (with lettered sub-

paragraphs here added for ease of reference below):

“[A] The Company may not assign to any person, firm, company or corporation not a
party hereto, in whole or in part, any of its rights, privileges, duties or obligations
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Government, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. [B] However, the Company shall be free
to assign, by instrument in writing, its rights, privileges, duties, or obligations under
this Agreement to an Affiliate provided that no such assignment shall in any way relieve
the assignor of any of its obligations hereunder.”

The Tribunal notes that Article 25[A] was no absolute bar to RSM’s assignment: such
assignment was permitted subject to Grenada’s prior consent which was not to be

unreasonably withheld.

Article 27: Article 27.1 of the Agreement, “Termination,” provided:

“Tf by reasons of expiration, surrender or cancellation the Company no longer holds
any Exploration Licence granted pursuant to Article 3 or any Development Licence
granted pursuant to Article 8, this Agreement shall be deemed to have been terminated,
but save as aforesaid, shall continue in full force and effect so long as the Company
continues to hold any of the said Licenses.

Article 29: Article 29.1(a) of the Agreement, “Notices,” provided:

“All notices and other communications to be given under this Agreement shall be given

PART IV: THE PRINCIPAL FACTS

Introduction

Inevitably, with the passage of time over the last ten or more years, there are important
contemporary documents missing from the Parties’ files; and the independent
recollections of witnesses are, even at best, not wholly reliable given such time and the
controversial history of the Parties’ several disputes. The Tribunal here sets out,
primarily from the contemporary materials known to both Parties at the relevant time
and adduced in evidence, the chronology of principal factual events insofar as relevant

to the decisions made in this Award.

October 1995

By letter dated 9 October 1995 to Mr Max B. Flaxman (President of Grynberg
Resources, Inc. of Cranford, New Jersey), Mr John Auguste, as Energy Conservation
Officer (then working within the Ministry of Finance) raised several queries arising
from the Grenadian Government’s preliminary review of RSM’s proposed production
sharing arrangement [CB01.291]. In particular, Mr Auguste raised questions about the
status of RSM and indicated that RSM’s proposal did not appear to take account of the
relevant Grenada statute, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Act 1989 with its two stage
licence system (first, exploration, and second, development), nor of the “concession
type of arrangement” recommended by the Economic and Legal Advisory Services
Division (ELAS) of the Commonwealth Secretariat and embodied in ELAS’s Model

Petroleum Agreement prepared for the Government of Grenada “in January 1993.”
Mr Auguste therefore enclosed, with his letter, a computer disk with copies of ELAS’

Model Agreement, the 1989 Act and draft Petroleum Regulations to be promulgated
under that Act.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 45 of 159

This ELAS Model Agreement appears to be a version of the “Draft Petroleum
Agreement between the Government of Grenada and ABC Oil Company (Grenada)
Limited” dated December 1991 [sic], prepared by the Technical Assistance Group of
the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-Operation [CB01.102]. This draft refers to
the 1989 Act in its preamble and terms [CB01.103, 111 etc.]; its articles included a
definition of “Affiliate” [CB01.104]; and it envisaged the ABC Company applying for
an Exploration Licence under the 1989 Act “As soon as possible after the Effective
Date [...],” with such licence extending for a period of four years with two renewals of
two years subject to the 1989 Act [CB01.112]. In the event of petroleum discovery, the
Company could obtain, subject to the 1989 Act, an Exploration Licence for a period of
twenty years, renewable for a further period of ten years [CB01.127 & 135]. Article 27
of the draft contained a “Force Majeure” clause [CB01.191]; Article 28 contained a
limited “Non-Assignment” clause [CB01.193]; Article 29 was an ICSID arbitration
clause with Grenada as the arbitral seat [CB01.194]; and Article 31 provided for the
laws of Grenada as the applicable law [CB01.199]. This lengthy Model Agreement is
clearly a well-considered legal document, as already suggested by its origin within the

Commonwealth.

Mr Auguste’s letter included a prescient warning:

“FF. With reference to the contract area, be advised that the southern portion of the
contract area should not include any area under maritime boundaries delimitation
negotiations.”

This was an implicit reference to boundary negotiations between Grenada and

Venezuela and Trinidad & Tobago.

By letter dated 16 October 1995 [CB01.293], Mr Grynberg as President of Grynberg
Production Corporation, replied to Mr Auguste’s letter of 9 October 1995, in place of
Mr Flaxman (who was said to be out of the country). Mr Grynberg described RSM as
“a new company” formed by him and owned by his three adult children: “The intent is
that Grynberg Petroleum will be a guarantor of all expenditures, but in fact, the three
children have their own money and it will be their money that will be invested.” Mr

Grynberg expressed his agreement to the two-stage system required by the 1989 Act;

and he indicated that he would be arriving in Grenada in November 1995 to pursue

further negotiations with the Government of Grenada. It is to be assumed that he did so.

Mr Grynberg’s letter also included the following paragraph, referring to Mr Auguste’s

warning regarding the contract area and boundary negotiations [CB01.294]:

“ff) Based on my meeting with Prime Minister Keith Mitchell, Mr Mitchell was anxious
to include the areas to median point between Venezuela and Grenada and between
Trinidad and Grenada, which would strengthen Grenada’s hand in negotiations. The
median point is based on the 1954 Geneva Convention [sic: 1958 Geneva Convention]
and, in fact, there is a precedence [sic: precedent] in 1985 where the median point
between Malta, which as you know is an island, and Libya which is on the African
continent, has been reached and agreed upon. ... I would like you to know that I have
agreed with the Prime Minister that Grynberg Petroleum will, in fact, pay all the legal
costs if it is necessary to argue Grenada’s ownership in the International Court of
Justice in The Hague, Netherlands.”

Apart from this offer of financial assistance, it is not clear from the evidence adduced in
these proceedings what positive contribution for Grenada’s benefit RSM and Mr
Grynberg could have brought to these maritime boundary negotiations, which had

begun before this offer of assistance.

As regards Venezuela and Trinidad & Tobago, their Treaty of 18 April 1990 on the
Delimitation of Marine and Submarine Areas had entered into force on 23 July 1991.
This 1990 Treaty long preceded even the Parties’ first dealings leading to the Parties’
Agreement in 1996.

As regards Grenada and Trinidad & Tobago, these two States were (and remain)
members of the Commonwealth on friendly diplomatic terms; and both were (and
remain) signatories to the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf and the
1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea [LA2.695]. The first
substantive round of negotiations on the delimitation of their maritime boundaries took
place in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, on 19 and 20 November 1992; and a joint report was
agreed by the two delegations [CB01.208]. The Grenada delegation included Duke
Pollard Esq, an international legal specialist from the Commonwealth Secretariat. As
there agreed, a second substantive round took place in St George’s, Grenada, on 29 and

30 July 1993; and the two delegations again agreed a joint report [CB01.215]. The

44

142.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 47 of 159

Grenada delegation included Mr Auguste and Mr Pollard, together with an expert
hydrographer. It was agreed that a third round of meetings would take place at a date to
be fixed through diplomatic channels. (The Tribunal returns to these matters at greater

length under Issue B below, in Part VI of this Award.)

Returning to the Agreement in this case, there followed over the next months several
drafts of the proposed agreement between RSM and Grenada, apparently exchanged
between the Parties. It serves little purpose to recite their terms here, save to note that
each draft contained arbitration and applicable law clauses in similar terms. Thus,
Article 26 of the undated draft of about November 1995 [CB01.16] contained an ICSID
arbitration clause with an English arbitral seat; and Article 28 provided for the
application of “the Laws of Grenada” [CB01.44 & 46]. In addition, Article 24
contained a “Force Majeure” clause [CB01.43]; and Article 25 a qualified “Non-
Assignment” clause [CB01.44].

(03) January 1996

143.

In his budget speech to the House of Representatives in Grenada’s legislature on 19
January 1996, the Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Grenada (The Hon Keith
Mitchell) indicated that the Grenada Government intended to resume negotiations on
maritime boundary delimitation with both Venezuela and Trinidad & Tobago. As to
the latter, an inter-governmental meeting was to take place in St Lucia within the week.

The Prime Minister also added:

“Mr Speaker, talks are now being held with several interested groups to deal with oil
exploration issues. Less than two weeks ago a delegation of oil exploration experts and
financiers from North America met with top Government officials, including myself,
and expressed great interest in oil exploration in Grenada. Mr Speaker, please rest
assured that our dealings would be clearly transparent, and that environmental
implications will be given the fullest consideration” [CB1.302].

This was a reference to RSM.

147.

By letter dated 2 April 1996 [CB01.305], Mr Grynberg replied to a letter dated 1 April
1996 from Mr Auguste to Senator Bowen, the Minister of Works, Communications and
Public Utilities (which is missing from the Parties’ files). Mr Grynberg’s letter is
addressed to the Prime Minister of Grenada (The Hon Keith Mitchell), describing
RSM’s future work on seismic data “as soon as the boundary problem is settled” and
offering RSM’s qualified financial assistance “in resolving its boundaries with

Venezuela.”

Mr Grynberg also made specific points in regard to the current draft agreement
apparently proffered by Mr Auguste, concluding: “We would like to assure you that we
very much wish to proceed with the project, which we believe will be of great benefit to
Grenada and its people. Although RSM will bear the entire risk and expense of this
very challenging and expensive exploration project, we believe the potential benefits to

all parties justify our undertaking” [emphasis supplied].

By letter dated 15 April 1996 [CB01.310], Mr Grynberg replied to a letter dated 13
April 1996 from Senator Bowen (which is missing from the Parties’ files), sent in
response to Mr Grynberg’s letter of 2 April 1997. It was copied to H.E. Denis Antoine
Esq.

It is a long, discursive letter, making detailed drafting points on the current draft
agreement, particularly tax matters. Three passages are significant for present purposes.
First, Mr Grynberg noted: “... what we are proposing in Grenada is a deep water risky
exploration project in an area which has no known oil and gas reserves.” Second,
subject to the changes proposed by him, RSM was ready “to proceed with the execution
of the agreement by Grenada and RSM.” Third, the letter concluded: “I will be in
London from May 8-17 [1996] to meet colleagues from the oil and gas industry on
other matters. It would be helpful if it were possible to receive an executed agreement
prior to that time so that I might then seek additional partners for this challenging

exploration venture.”

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 49 of 159

This reference to “additional partners” could readily be understood, albeit implicitly, as
a statement of RSM’s intention to ‘farm out’ or transfer part of its performance of the
Agreement, consistent with the Agreement’s provisions on assignment (Article 25). It

elicited no adverse reaction from the Government of Grenada at the time.

Towards the end of April 1996, Grenada’s Cabinet approved the final draft of the
Agreement. It was not submitted for approval to Parliament; nor was it required to be

so approved under Grenada’s Constitution or the 1989 Act.

(05) May 1996

150.

151.

152.

By letter dated 28 May 1996 to Mr Flaxman (as Vice-President of Grynberg Production
Corporation), Senator Bowen replied to Mr Flaxman’s letter also dated 28 May 1996

(the latter is missing from the Parties’ files).

Senator Bowen there confirmed (inter alia) Grenada’s disinclination to agree a force
majeure clause with no time limit to the period of force majeure. It appears that RSM
had wanted no time-limit because the cause of delay, namely international border
negotiations with its neighbouring states, could be lengthy; and it also appears that, if
any time-limit was to be agreed by RSM, RSM was proposing a limit of not less than

ten years.

By letter dated 29 May 1996 to Senator Bowen [CB1.317], Mr Flaxman offered several
terms to be included in a draft side-letter, including assistance to Grenada in its border
negotiations “or the International Court of Justice.” Mr Flaxman did not here give way

to Senator Bowen’s concerns over a time-limit to the force majeure clause.

(06) June 1996

153. The outstanding negotiations were apparently concluded by telephone on 10 June 1996,
as a result of which Mr Auguste summarised the Parties’ agreement by letter dated 10
June 1996 to Mr Grynberg [CB01.321]. As regards force majeure and the time-limit for

the application of the Exploration Licence, it contained the following paragraphs:

“B.B With reference to the establishment of a limit for the existing force majeure event,
be advised that I am in agreement with Mr Flaxman’s suggestion that this matter be
held in abeyance for the time being. The three-year limit negates the
nature/characteristics and complexities inherent to Maritime Boundaries Delimitation
Negotiations.

Your attention is hereby drawn to Articles #24.1 and #24.3. I am of the opinion that the
afore-mentioned articles take care of the concerns of both parties (RSM and
Government of Grenada).”

“DD. Grateful if consideration would be given to an extension of the time period for
the issuance of the exploration license from seven (7) days to ninety (90) days. This
would allow ample time for the finalisation and promulgation of the Petroleum and
Regulations Act, and other institutional arrangements.”

Articles 24.1 and 24.2 of the Agreement, as eventually executed by the Parties
[CB01.350], contain no time-limit on the duration of the force majeure period. It is to
be noted, however, that RSM agreed, as requested by Grenada, to extend the time-limit
from seven to ninety days. It follows that the bulk of this time-period was intended by
the Parties to be required for Grenada’s Government and Civil Service in discharging
Grenada’s obligation to issue the Exploration Licence, rather than RSM’s discharge of

its obligation to apply for the Licence to Grenada, in comparison a much simpler task.
(07) July 1996
154. The Agreement: The Parties executed the Agreement on 4 July 1996, with Mr Flaxman
signing for RSM and Senator Patrick Bubb, Minister of State in the Ministry of

Finance, signing for Grenada [Exhibit C-1].

155. Force Majeure Letter: By letter dated 18 July 1996 signed by Mr Flaxman, fourteen

days later, addressed to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance (being a

15

a

recipient designated under Article 29 of the Agreement), RSM gave written notice of
force majeure under Article 24 of the Agreement [CB02.359; Exhibit C-10]. Given its

significance to the Parties’ dispute, its terms merit citing in full:

“In accordance with Article 24 of the Agreement between us dated July 4, 1996, RSM
Production Corporation hereby notifies the Government of Grenada of the occurrence
of a force majeure event, ‘dispute as to the Government [of Grenada] ’s ownership of or
control over the petroleum in any portion of the Agreement area.’

Under Article 24.4, this dispute is deemed ‘a force majeure event as to the entire
Agreement Area, thereby excusing performance of all the Company's [RSM Production
Corporation] obligations under this Agreement and extends the duration of the
Agreement and the time allowed for performance or fulfilment of all of such obligations
by the period required to establish beyond doubt the Government’s ownership of, and
control over, all petroleum in this entire area.’

In negotiations RSM has agreed to reimburse to this Government such direct costs and
expenses, not exceeding US$400,000, as may be incurred by the Government for third
party services in establishing its ownership and control of the petroleum in the entire
Agreement Area, although RSM has reserved the right to terminate, in its sole
discretion, such reimbursements at any time. For its part, the Government of Grenada
has agreed vigorously to pursue all appropriate means for establishing its ownership
and control of such petroleum, and has further agreed that any reimbursement amounts
paid to it by RSM in connection with third party service shall conclusively be deemed
proper expenditures in connection with the Initial Exploration Period which shall
directly reduce the minimum expenditure required under Article 4.1(a) during the
Initial Exploration Period.”

The letter was counter-signed by Senator Bubb for Grenada under the heading

“Accepted and Agreed: Government of Grenada,” undated.

Senator Bubb was not called as a witness by Grenada in these proceedings; and the full
surrounding circumstances in which he counter-signed this letter were not adduced in
evidence before this Tribunal. He was clearly a material witness in these proceedings;
and his conduct is not entirely explained by the submission, made by Grenada’s
Counsel in his closing oral submissions, that Senator Bubb “was a relatively
accommodating person” [D5.207]. The Tribunal was informed by Grenada’s Counsel
that Senator Bubb is no longer in Grenada, apparently living somewhere in the United
States of America not known to the Government of Grenada [D5.175]. It remains the
fact, however, that RSM’s letter was signed, accepted and agreed by Grenada, as
Grenada had signed the Agreement itself, again by Senator Bubb. Accordingly,

deprived of any testimony from Senator Bubb in these proceedings, the Tribunal is not

49

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 52 of 159

inclined to accept commercial criticisms from Grenada as to the terms of either this
letter or the Agreement itself; and for this reason, it takes no account of that part of the

expert report of Mr Tauecchio, adduced by Grenada.

157. As regards the letter’s third paragraph (cited above), there was no funding of US

$400,000 by RSM.

(08) August 1996

158. On or about 1 August 1996, the Government of Grenada issued a press release briefly

reporting the Parties’ Agreement, indicating that exploration for oil and gas within
Grenada’s territorial waters “may begin soon,” that discussions were under away, led
by Senator Bowen, “toward making out a distinct line to separate Grenada from
Venezuela and Grenada from Trinidad” and that once this was done “oil and gas
exploration should start soon afterwards.” This press release was sent to RSM by the

U.S. Embassy in Grenada [CB2.360].

(09) September 1996 etc.

159. By letter dated 12 September 1996, Grenada named Mr Grynberg as “a Special Envoy

160.

of the Government of Grenada to the Republic of Venezuela for the purpose of
discussing issues related to petroleum resources” [CB2.364]. This designation was
made for the purpose of including Mr Grynberg as a member of Senator Bowen’s team
assembling for the forthcoming maritime boundary negotiations between Venezuela
and Grenada, taking place later in September in Caracas. (Mr Grynberg later attended a
different meeting in Caracas in September 1997, on his own initiative.) It is convenient

here to project forward this part of the chronology.

Mr Grynberg was no “team-player” for Grenada; and there were soon complaints
within the Government of Grenada that he was pursuing his own commercial
objectives, in conflict with the interests of Grenada. As expressed to Senator Bowen by
Mr Auguste (now Permanent Secretary and Director General at the Ministry of

Finance) by letter dated 15 November 1996: “Maritime Boundaries Delimitation

50

161.

16:

N

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 53 of 159

Negotiations require adequate preparation, knowledge, expertise and experienced
personnel, fully cognisant of the relevant issues and good negotiators. It is not a simple
commercial negotiation/deal, nor is it dependent on personal contact and overtures,
‘wheeling and dealing’ etc. Team work is also an essential ingredient/parameter in the

formula for success” [CB2.368-369].

By letter dated 15 December 1997, Mr Grynberg released to the Government of
Trinidad & Tobago, via his representative Mr Thomas (a former Trinidadian Minister),
boundary materials deliberately slanted against Grenada “because I would like a speedy
resolution of the boundary demarcation” [CB2.370]. When asked to explain this
statement under cross-examination by Grenada’s Counsel at the Main Hearing, he
testified that his statement was “not correct” and that he wrote it only “because I
wanted Rod Thomas to have a point of argument that this is good for Trinidad as well”
and “strictly for negotiating purposes” [D3.82-83]. This letter was not copied to
Grenada at the time; and mendacity of this nature was never likely to promote good
inter-state relations between Grenada and Trinidad & Tobago. It demonstrates Mr
Grynberg’s pursuit of his own commercial interests (with RSM), at the expense of and

in conflict with Grenada’s own interests.

When the boundary negotiations between Venezuela and Grenada eventually took place
on 19 May 1998 in Grenada, attended by (inter alios) Senator Bowen and Mr Auguste
for Grenada, Mr Grynberg was not present [CB2.382]. Notwithstanding that he was no
longer a member of Grenada’s team, Mr Grynberg sought to intervene in these
negotiations by letter dated 4 February 1999 to Dr Cervini [CB2.386]. Mr Grynberg
there enclosed, in his own words RSM’s “license [sic] which RSM Production
Corporation, an affiliate of Grynberg Petroleum Company, has offshore Grenada.” At
that time, RSM had no such licence but only the Agreement. At the end of his letter,
Mr Grynberg concluded: “The Grenada negotiating team is available to come to
Caracas on short notice to meet and discuss the subject with appropriate authorities. If
you have questions or clarifications are needed [sic], I will be more than happy to do
so.” Mr Grynberg was not a member of the “Grenada negotiating team”; he was not

authorised to negotiate for Grenada; he was intervening as a private person, a foreigner,

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 54 of 159

in Grenada’s inter-state affairs for the purpose of advancing his own commercial

interests; and his conduct was improper by any standard of representative diplomacy.

The first substantive round of negotiations between Venezuela and Grenada took place
at St George’s from 28 February to 2 March 2001. The team leader for Grenada was
Senator Bowen, assisted by (inter alios) Mr Auguste [CB2.415]. Mr Grynberg was not
present. The second and third rounds took place later in 2001, again without Mr

Grynberg [CB2.450].

It would serve little purpose to recite here the many further attempts by Mr Grynberg to
insert himself, unbidden, into Grenada’s diplomatic negotiations with Venezuela and
Trinidad & Tobago; and the Tribunal considers the matter more fully under Issue B in
Part VI below within its contractual context. In summary, Mr Grynberg’s schemes
become increasingly outlandish, including another proposal to bring proceedings
against Trinidad & Tobago before the International Court of Justice at The Hague
[CB2.389 & 398-399]; a proposal that he and Venezuela’s representative “as two
technical people” sit down and establish the maritime boundary between Grenada and
Venezuela “in a day” [CB2.396, 397]; ICSID proceedings against Trinidad & Tobago
and Petrotrin, claiming damages in excess of US $100 million, in September 2002
[CB2.462 & 467]; legal proceedings against Trinidad & Tobago and Petrotrin before
the UN International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea, in October 2002 [CB2.498],
supported by a sworn but incorrect affidavit from Mr Grynberg that “RSM was
authorized to represent the Government of Grenada for the purposes of instituting these
proceedings” — RSM had no such authority [CB2.522]; a letter before action to the
Prime Minister of Trinidad & Tobago and Petrotrin alleging trespass by Trinidad &
Tobago in obtaining seismic and other data from Grenada’s maritime area [CB2.536];
legal proceedings in the U.S. District Court in Denver, Colorado against Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A, PDVSA Petréleo S.A. and CITGO Petroleum Corporation, in April
2003 [CB2.543, CB3.552, CB3.676]; and a gratuitous personal attack on Senator
Bowen by letter dated 28 February 2003 to Grenada’s Prime Minister [CB2.538].

Mr Grynberg’s conduct was made in the face of Grenada’s repeated requests to him not

to intervene in its diplomatic and inter-state negotiations with Venezuela and Trinidad

52

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 55 of 159

& Tobago. Again, it would serve little purpose in reciting these materials in full here. It
suffices to cite Senator Bowen’s letter to Mr Grynberg dated 26 January 2001
[CB2.414]: “Any consideration of the request made therein [Mr Grynberg’s letter] for
the alteration of what are now not even confirmed as being within Grenada’s territorial
boundaries will jeopardize the negotiations between Grenada and our neighbours. In
fact, Venezuela wants no contact or involvement of any person except Grenada
Government Officials in the boundary delimitation process with Grenada ....” Similar
requests, more strongly worded, were made by Senator Bowen’s letters to Mr Grynberg

dated 3 and 10 April 2001 [CB2.442 & 445].

(10) March 1998

166.

167.

In March 1998, RSM executed the Initial Grenada Inter-Company Agreement with
Vintage Petroleum Inc., of Delaware [CB2.376; R-17]. Its terms read somewhat oddly
with the Parties’ Agreement; but it is clear that the overriding condition precedents
contained in Article 2 of this agreement were never satisfied, including “the receipt of
all necessary approvals by the Government of Grenada.” Moreover, the other two
named parties never in fact executed this agreement (Premier Consolidated Oilfields ple
and Santa Fe Energy Resources Inc). Later, by letter dated 5 December 2002 to Mr
Grynberg, Vintage withdrew from this project [CB2.533].

In the Tribunal’s view, this agreement can be disregarded for the purpose of Article 25
of the Agreement; it was no assignment of anything; and it cannot therefore amount to

any contractual breach by RSM, as alleged by Grenada.

(11) September 2000

168.

By letter dated 27 September 2000 to Senator Bowen, Mr Grynberg informed Grenada
that he had secured the services of a seismic vessel to run two seismic test lines in
Grenadian waters, each of approximately fifty kilometres [CB2.402]. He inquired
whether “there are any fishing boats in this area because fishing boats may interfere
with this program and the seismic ship, of course, will interfere with the fishing

operations.”

53

16

©

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 56 of 159

By letter dated 4 October 2000, the Ministry of Works informed Mr Grynberg that the
Chief Fisheries Officer had advised that the proposed seismic survey should not pose
any adverse effects in the targeted areas” [CB2.405]. By letter dated 29 November
2000 to Mr Auguste [CB2.410], Mr Grynberg sent a “shot point map showing the two

lines shot in October.”

(12) November 2002 etc.

170.

171.

172.

By letter dated 11 November 2002 to Mr Auguste [CB2.527], Mr Grynberg confirmed
that he would be undertaking further seismic work offshore Grenada during the winter
[CB2.527]. By letter dated 29 January 2003 to Mr Grynberg [CB2.534], Grenada
informed Mr Grynberg that, during a review period, it “would not be issuing and

[approving] permits for vessels to conduct seismic in Grenadian waters ....”

A later incident took place on 11 February 2004 where the vessel “GSI Admiral” was
operating in Grenada’s Exclusive Economic Zone about twelve miles offshore and
interfered with Grenadian fishing-boats. The Grenada Fisheries Division, Coast Guard,
Port Authority and Ministry of Foreign and External Affairs had no prior knowledge of

this seismic research, which had been commissioned by RSM.

It is clear from the evidence in these proceedings that RSM had no actual permission or
other licence for the activities of the “GSI Admiral,” in contrast to the earlier seismic
work [CB3.607]. The consequences were serious for Grenadian fisherman: deprived of
any warning from the Grenadian Government, their long lines suffered extensive
damage for which the Government was obliged to pay them compensation as regards
replacement, loss of earnings and loss of use, in the total sum of EC$ 391, 860.00

[CB4.1162].

12 & 13.01.2004: By letter dated 12 January 2004 from Mr Grynberg to the Prime
Minister of Grenada, RSM revoked force majeure [CB3.589, 590]: “Because we are
now confident that we can proceed on our license offshore Grenada we are revoking the
force majeure and attaching our check #24280 dated January 12, 2004 in the amount of
$19,200.00 for payment of the first year’s rental in accordance with the license
agreement terms.” Mr Grynberg copied his letter to Senator Bowen, Mr Auguste, and to
the Leader of the Opposition. Although dated 12 January 2004, the fax transmission to
Grenada took place on 13 January 2004.

Insofar as this letter suggests that RSM already had an Exploration Licence, it was of
course mistaken: there was still no licence granted by Grenada, as both Parties knew.
The letter can only be read as foreshadowing a future application by RSM for an

Exploration Licence.

(14) February 2004

175.

176.

19.02.2004: There was no response by Grenada to RSM’s letter until Senator Bowen’s
letter dated 19 February 2004 to Mr Grynberg [CB3.602]. Senator Bowen made two
points: RSM had no licence, contrary to RSM’s letter; and RSM’s letter had been
passed to the Government’s legal department for advice regarding “the effect of Force

Majeure.” He also returned RSM’s cheque.

27.02.2004: Mr Grynberg signed a letter dated 27 February 2004, revoking force
majeure, addressed to the “Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance,” being an
express addressee for notices under Article 29.1(a) of the Agreement [CB3.604].
Unusually, Mr Grynberg did not copy his letter to any other recipient within the
Government of Grenada, including the Prime Minister, Senator Bowen and Mr
Auguste. This letter was not sent by registered post to the Ministry of Finance; nor by

fax; and it is not clear what method of transmission was actually used by RSM.

In this letter, acknowledging receipt of Senator Bowen’s letter dated 19 February 2004,
Mr Grynberg wrote that the “dispute concerning ownership of the petroleum in certain
portions of the Agreement Area has not been fully resolved, but RSM now believes that
there has been sufficient progress on this matter that the dispute no longer prevents it
[RSM] from applying for the Exploration Licence ....” The Tribunal notes that, as then
recognised by RSM, Grenada’s unresolved maritime boundary negotiations with its
neighbouring states did not preclude RSM from preparing its application for an

Exploration Licence under Article 3 of the Agreement.

In addition, Mr Grynberg’s letter stated that RSM would proceed with its application

for an Exploration Licence:

“... no later than May 10, 2004 which reflects our computation of the original 90-day
application period, as enlarged by the occurrence of the force majeure event beginning
on July 18, 1996. In part, this reflects RSM’s determination that its letter to the Prime
Minister [i.e. Mr Grynberg’s letter dated 12 January 2004] was wholly ineffective as
having been sent to the wrong office, and that the force majeure condition is only now
lifted by the delivery of this letter. If the Government of Grenada disagrees with our
computation, we would very much appreciate your advice, although RSM certainly
does not intend to wait until the end of this period. Instead, RSM will apply as soon as
reasonably practicable ....”

RSM included with this letter a cashier’s check dated 26 February 2004 in the amount
of US $19,200.00. (It is not apparent from the evidence what happened with such a

cheque, if it was received by Grenada).

There was no response from Grenada to Mr Grynberg’s letter dated 27 February 2004.

At the time, RSM should have been on guard, given Senator Bowen’s letter dated 19
February 2004 (see above), that it should act as prudently as possible as regards the
effluxion of time under the ninety-day period, particularly after almost eight years had
passed since the Agreement’s “Effective Date.” Indeed, Mr Grynberg indicated in his
letter that RSM would make its application “as soon as reasonably practicable” without
waiting any further. RSM did not, in fact, make its application until April 2004, as

recited below.

There is no issue that Mr Grynberg’s letter dated 27 February 2004 was received by the
Ministry of Finance and that this Ministry was a designated recipient for
communications from RSM, under Article 29(1)(a) of the Agreement (quoted above,
paragraph 126 at p. 39). However, the question arose between the Parties as to when it

was so “delivered” by RSM under Article 29 of the Agreement.

Senator Bowen testified that he himself did not recall seeing this letter at the time: “It is
likely that little attention was given to it by the Ministry of Finance, because they had
not had any involvement with the communication between the Government and RSM
since 1999, when the Energy Unit was transferred out of the Ministry. For years RSM
had sent their communications either to me, to Mr Auguste or to the Prime Minister,
and the responses were always received either from me or from Mr Auguste. In the
ordinary course, the Ministry of Finance would eventually have forwarded the letter to
my Ministry [i.e. the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Lands and Fisheries], although
as I have said I do not recall seeing it at the time” [Bowen WS1.46]. There is no

evidence that the Prime Minister or Mr Auguste saw Mr Grynberg’s letter at the time.

The correspondence registry of the Ministry of Finance, a contemporary document,
records the receipt of Mr Grynberg’s letter as at 14 April 2004 [Exhibit R-111]. This
registry was only seen by Senator Bowen during these proceedings (after his first
witness statement); and he confirmed during his oral testimony the significance of this
entry as showing that the Ministry of Finance did not receive Mr Grynberg’s letter on

27 February but only much later on 14 April 2004 [D4.9 & 74].

Mr Grynberg was cross-examined by Grenada’s Counsel as to the sending of his letter
dated 27 February 2004 to the Ministry of Finance [D2.126-128]. He could not, of
course, give any direct evidence as to the date of its receipt by the Ministry of Finance.
In these circumstances, the only question before this Tribunal is when this letter was in
fact “delivered” to Grenada within the meaning of Article 29(1)(a) of the Agreement

and, depending on that date, what consequences might follow.

In cross-examination by RSM’s Counsel, it was suggested to Senator Bowen that,
having in fact received Mr Grynberg’s letter on or soon after 27 February 2004, Senator

Bowen “had simply decided not to reply in detail at all to Mr Grynberg’s letter and to

wait and see what happened in regard the 90 days, and if it didn’t come in on time you
would use that as the basis for not giving the licence” [D4.75]. Senator Bowen testified
that this was not so: he had not seen the letter at the time; it was not copied to him; it
was not received by the Ministry of Finance before 14 April 2004; and he saw it only

later.

Having considered all the evidence, the Tribunal concludes that Mr Grynberg’s letter
was not delivered to Grenada until 14 April 2004 and, following its receipt by the
Ministry of Finance for Grenada, it was only seen by Senator Bowen subsequently. The
Tribunal cannot determine from the evidence exactly when it was received by Senator
Bowen. However, the Tribunal determines that Senator Bowen did not see Mr

Grynberg’s letter before 14 April 2004.

The Tribunal also accepts the truth of Senator Bowen’s testimony as to the absence of
any deliberate decision by Grenada not to respond in a timely manner to Mr Grynberg’s
letter dated 27 February 2004 before the expiry of the ninety-day period under Article

3.1 of the Agreement, however calculated.

The difference between 27 February and 14 April 2004 was potentially significant for
the Parties’ cases under Article 3 of the Agreement, because (on the Tribunal’s
calculations) the ninety-day time limit expired on 28 March 2004. Accordingly, there
was still time between 27 February and 28 March 2004 for RSM to make a timely

application for an Exploration Licence under Article 3.1 of the Agreement.

If Grenada had deliberately kept silent on 27 February 2004 upon receipt of Mr
Grynberg’s letter, deciding then not to respond to Mr Grynberg’s request for
confirmation that RSM’s computation was correct as a means of luring RSM into a
trap, that would have raised very serious questions not only as regards Grenada’s good
faith and Senator Bowen’s general credibility as a witness, but also whether Grenada’s
case should prevail under Grenadian law at all. However, as indicated, the Tribunal
determines that Mr Grynberg’s letter dated 27 February 2004 was delivered to Grenada
after 28 March 2004 (i.e., 14 April 2004) based on the Ministry of Finance’s registry.
It follows that Grenada could not have kept deliberately silent before 28 March 2004 in

response to a letter which it had not yet received; and there could be no bad faith or

58

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 61 of 159

other unconscionable conduct by Grenada in not responding to such letter before 28
March 2004. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that these issues do not arise for

decision by the Tribunal in this case.

05.04.2004: By letter dated 5 April 2004 from Mr Grynberg to the Permanent
Secretary, Ministry of Finance [CB3.610], RSM indicated that it would proceed with its
application for an Exploration Licence. This letter was copied to (inter alios) the Prime
Minister and Senator Bowen; and it was received by Grenada on 6 April 2004. The

Tribunal infers that this letter was sent by fax directly by RSM to Grenada.

06.04.2004: By a document dated 6 April 2004 signed by Mr Grynberg [CB3.611],
RSM applied to Grenada for an Exploration Licence. Mr Grynberg there noted (inter
alia) that the force majeure event ran from 18 July 1996 until RSM’s letter dated 27
February 2004 [CB3.614-615].

13 & 14.04.2004: The Parties dispute when and how RSM’s application was
communicated to and received by Grenada. It has been difficult for the Tribunal to
determine the precise date of this application, given conflicting testimony and missing
contemporary records. For this exercise, it is important to note that Monday, 12 April
2004 was a public holiday in Grenada (the Easter Holiday weekend having begun on
Friday, 9 April 2004). Accordingly, the Grenada Government’s offices re-opened on
Tuesday, 13 April 2004 and were open also on Wednesday, 14 April 2004. It is also
important to recall that 2004 was a leap year, with 29 February 2004 as an extra day

during that month.

It is convenient next to summarise the factual evidence for the two Parties respectively,

as found by the Tribunal.

RSM: According to RSM’s eventual case, the application was sent under cover of the
letter dated 13 April 2004 from RSM’s attorney in Grenada, Mr James Bristol
[CB3.626]. There are two versions of this letter. The first has the addressee struck out

in manuscript (i.e., the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance) and bears a stamp

dated 14 April 2004 of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [CB3.626:
Exhibit R-62]. The second is identical save that the addressee is not struck out; and it
bears the stamp receipt of the Ministry of Finance date-stamped “Apr 14 2004,”
adduced by Grenada at the Main Hearing with the Tribunal’s permission [Exhibit R-
111”).

Mr Bristol testified, in his witness statement, that he was “confident” that his letter and
attached application were delivered by hand to the Ministry of Finance on Tuesday, 13
April 2004, as the first working day after the Easter holidays: paragraphs 3-6
[WS2.446-447]. The Ministry of Finance was a mere five minutes’ walk from his
chambers. He also referred to a note in his firm’s postal record book suggesting that his
clerk posted a copy of his letter to RSM on 13 April 2004, which suggested to him that
the original letter (with the application) would have been delivered to the Ministry of

Finance on that same day.

In his oral testimony at the Main Hearing, Mr Bristol broadly confirmed his written
testimony [D1.183]. In the Tribunal’s view, however, Mr Bristol had no independent
recollection of the events of 13 or 14 April 2004; but he was clearly an honest witness,
doing his best to reconstruct what probably happened and when, where the most

significant element was (in his view) his firm’s postal record book.

On RSM’s application, the Tribunal admitted into evidence the relevant part of that
postal record book [Exhibit C-108], together with a copy of Mr Bristol’s letter to Mr
Grynberg of RSM bearing the date of 13 April 2004 [D1.222]. Both contemporary

documents indirectly support Mr Bristol’s testimony.

Mr Bristol added that the hand-delivery to the Ministry of Finance would have been
made by his secretary, Ms Marion Williams; and in accordance with his firm’s
procedure, Ms Williams would have procured the Ministry’s signed receipt in the
firm’s receipt book [D1.185]. Unfortunately, Mr Bristol’s firm could no longer locate
that receipt book; and it was not therefore submitted into evidence in these arbitration

proceedings.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 63 of 159

On 20 April 2004, Senator Bowen met RSM’s representative, Mr David Myrick Jr.
Senator Bowen expressed concern over certain aspects of RSM’s application; but it is

common ground that Senator Bowen said nothing about RSM’s application being late.

Grenada: Grenada’s case on lateness was first advanced by letter dated 27 April 2004
from Senator Bowen to Mr Grynberg [CB3.631], contending that RSM’s application
was contractually out of time and therefore invalid under Article 3.1 of the Agreement.
It was there said that the time-limit was ninety days from the “Effective Date” of the
Agreement (being 4 July 1996), of which fourteen days were exhausted prior to the
force majeure period commencing on 18 July 1996, leaving thereafter a period of 76
days. That period began to run again on 12 January 2004, therefore expiring on 28
March 2004. Accordingly, RSM’s application, whether made on 13 or 14 April 2004,
was made too late on any view; RSM was therefore too late under the Agreement’s
time-limit; and the Agreement accordingly lapsed or expired in accordance with its

terms and Grenadian law.

At the Main Hearing, as already indicated, Grenada introduced two further documents,
as “Exhibit R-111,” with the permission of the Tribunal [D1.222]. The first document
was the original document received by Grenada’s Ministry of Finance, without the
addressee’s deletion evident from the copy described above, date-stamped by the
Ministry on 14 April 2004 [Exhibits R-62, R-111]. The second document was the
correspondence register of the Ministry of Finance for 14 April 2004, recording (as the
last item on that day) its receipt of a letter from “James A.L. Bristol” with the
description “Application for Exploration Licence.” In Grenada’s closing oral
submissions, its Counsel submitted that that all the evidence clearly established that

RSM’s application was made to Grenada on 14 April and not 13 April 2004 [D5.116].

The Tribunal notes that Mr Grynberg, in his affidavit sworn on 7 May 2007 in the New

York Legal Proceedings, testified as follows:

“16. RSM delivered its application for an oil and natural gas exploration licence to the
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance on April 14, 2004, after a four (4) day
holiday.”

61

203.

a

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 64 of 159

This delivery date of 14 April 2004 accords with the date set out in RSM’s letter dated
4 May 2004 (see below); and it was the date first pleaded by RSM in its Request for
Arbitration of 31 August 2004 addressed to ICSID: “18. RSM delivered its application
for an oil and gas exploration licence a copy of which is attached as Exhibit I, to the

Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance on April 14, 2004” [WS1.4].

In conclusion, having considered all the evidence, the Tribunal finds that RSM’s
application was made to Grenada either on 13 or 14 April 2004. As appears later

below, this difference is legally immaterial to the Parties’ dispute.

(16) May 2004

204.

205.

By letter dated 4 May 2004 from RSM’s General Counsel (Mr Roger A. Jatko) to
Senator Bowen [CB3.633], RSM disagreed with Senator Bowen’s calculations,
contending (inter alia) that time ran from 27 February 2004 whereby the application
was made timeously. Mr Jatko also contended that, if time ran from 12 January 2004,
“., the licence application was filed on April 14, 2004 — the ninetieth day. Thus the
license application was timely filed even if the improper notice dated January 12 were

used as the triggering event” [CB3.634].

By the summer of 2004, both Parties were advancing irreconcilable arguments; none of
their differences were reconciled; legal advisers were acting on both sides; and it would
serve no purpose here to recite arguments and counter-arguments which have later

formed the Parties’ more extensive submissions in these arbitration proceedings.

(17) August 2004

206. In due course, on 31 August 2004, RSM filed its Request for Arbitration against

Grenada with ICSID [CB3.663], initiating this arbitration. (ICSID’s Acting Secretary-
General registered RSM’s Request on 5 August 2005 pursuant to Article 36(3) of the
ICSID Convention).

62

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 65 of 159

(18) July 2005

207. By letter of 5 July 2005 [CB3.771], the senior law officer in the Government of
Grenada, Mr Hugh Wildman, formally notified RSM that Grenada was terminating the

Agreement. It merits extensive citation, as follows:

“.. Legal Position

The legal position can be shortly stated as follows. Under clause 3.1, the 90 day period
for applying for an exploration licence expired on 2 October 1996. No application was
made by RSM by that date. Even if (which is not accepted) RSM’s letter of 18 July
1996 concerning force majeure had the effect of suspending the time within which RSM
had to apply for an exploration licence, the 90 day period had resumed at the latest
from 12 January 2004 when you wrote to the Prime Minister that “(B)ecause we are
now confident that we can proceed with our licence offshore Grenada we are revoking
the force majeure...” Allowing for the 14 days prior to the letter of 18 July 1996, the
remaining period of 76 days would have expired on 28 March 2004. RSM did not
apply for an exploration licence until 14 April 2004. It therefore failed to comply with
the strict time limit imposed by clause 3.1.

To suggest as you have in correspondence (notably in your letter to us of 4 May 2004)
that the notice contained in your letter to the Prime minister dated 12 January 2004
“could only be effective if directed to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of
Finance” is legally untenable, as is the contention elsewhere in the letter that “(D)f,
however, the January 12 letter were viewed as an effective notice, then such notice
must, in accordance with Article 19.1 of the Petroleum Agreement be “delivered or sent
by registered post”. Clause 29 is simply a notice clause which provides that notices or
communications “may” (not “must”) be given to the Permanent Secretary of the
Ministry of Finance. This means that the Permanent Secretary is authorized to receive
the notice. It does not mean that no-one else is. Clause 29 is facultative. The
procedure provided for it is not the only contractually effective method of
communicating with the Government.

Even if (which is not accepted) your letter of 12 January 2004 was not legally effective
notice under the Agreement, it is powerful evidence that by that date RSM was in fact
no longer prevented from performing its obligations. That in itself is enough to bring
an end to the period of suspension. It is also enough to require RSM to give notice
under clause 24 of the Agreement. Assuming in your favour that only notice to the
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance would suffice, RSM was in Breach
[sic] of its obligation under clause 24.2 to give that notice “promptly” by waiting until
27 February 2004 to do so. As a matter of Grenadian law, RSM cannot rely on its own
breach of clause 24 as extending the period for which, as RSM contends, it was relived
(sic: relieved) of its contractual obligations.

Termination of the Agreement

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 66 of 159

By failing to apply for an exploration licence within the 90 day period stipulated under
clause 3.1, RSM is in clear breach of the Agreement. It follows, as Leading English
Counsel has confirmed, that the Government is entitled to terminate the Agreement.
Please treat this letter as notification to RSM of that termination.

As you know, Clause 26(1) of the Agreement provides that disputes or differences
between the parties should, if possible, be “resolved amicably by negotiations”. The
Government's position as conveyed in this letter will not be unfamiliar to you. We have
previously communicated it to you, notably in our letter of 27 April 2004. Your
reaction to that letter, and the adversarial steps taken by you subsequently, suggest that
there is no realistic prospect of an amicable resolution. We nevertheless invite you to
review the stance that you have taken to date, and to accept that the Government is
entitled to terminate the Agreement for the reasons given.

Should you decline to do so, the Government would wish the dispute to be resolved by
ICSID arbitration as expeditiously as possible. If the arbitrations’ award [sic] shows
that we are wrong, we will of course abide by the result.

We would appreciate a prompt response to this letter.””

From this point onwards, as already indicated, it serves no purpose to set out in this

chronology further events taking place within these arbitration proceedings.

(19) Miscellaneous

209. Mr Grynberg: Mr Grynberg is a senior figure with a strong character, having lived a

full and eventful life. In the disarming words of RSM’s Counsel in his closing oral
submission: “Grynberg is plainly a litigious man. You may have thought at some points
in his evidence that he, if not relished the description, certainly didn’t shrink from it”
[D5.8]. Mr Grynberg and his companies are certainly no strangers to litigation or the
threat of litigation, even measured by the standards of a belligerent industry: Grenada
submitted a documented list of 171 cases filed in U.S. Federal Courts and 33 cases filed
in U.S. State Courts by Mr Grynberg and his companies as plaintiffs, unrelated to the
Parties’ present dispute (Appendix to Counter-Memorial). Mr Grynberg was also
subjected to much more severe criticism by Grenada’s Counsel during the course of

these proceedings, including allegations of deceit, mendacity and manipulation.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 67 of 159

The Tribunal accepts that Mr Grynberg is a strong and forceful character, has a litigious
temperament, displays an aggressive personality, does not shirk from controversy and
lacks nothing by way of assertive self-confidence. None of these attributes, even if
they amounted to criticism, are decisive for the Tribunal’s decisions in this Award.
However, based on his testimony in these proceedings, the Tribunal concludes that Mr
Grynberg can, on occasion, say what he wants to believe or have believed with little or
no factual foundation for such belief. The Tribunal does not think it necessary, or
appropriate, to accept any further personal criticism from Grenada of Mr Grynberg’s
general character for the purpose of this Award, save where indicated expressly

otherwise below.

. Senator Bowen: RSM impugned the honesty and competence of Senator Bowen, both

in these arbitration proceedings and, to a much greater extent in formal court
documents submitted in the New York Proceedings and supplied to the Tribunal in

these proceedings.

On all the evidence adduced in these arbitration proceedings, the Tribunal does not
accept any of these personal criticisms of Senator Bowen for the purpose of its
decisions in this Award. Moreover, after a firm but fair cross-examination of Senator
Bowen during the Main Hearing, RSM’s Counsel submitted in his closing oral
submissions that RSM was not requesting this Tribunal, in these proceedings, to find
Senator Bowen “corrupt” or “incompetent” in these arbitration proceedings [D5.50].

Nor does it.

PART V: ISSUE A — JURISDICTION

(01) Introduction

213. In its Request for Arbitration, the Claimant invoked the Arbitration Agreement
(contained in Article 26.2 of the 1996 Agreement, cited above in full). According to
that provision, subject to Article 26.1 (which calls, first, for amicable negotiations in
order to solve disputes or differences between the parties), “all disputes with respect to
any matter arising out of or relating to the Petroleum Agreement shall be referred to
arbitration pursuant to Article 26.3.” Article 26.3 then provides that unresolved disputes

shall be submitted for settlement by arbitration to ICSID.

214. In its Memorial, the Claimant added that Grenada, by its senior law officer, reiterated
the Grenada Government’s consent to ICSID jurisdiction in the letter sent to RSM on 5
July 2005, in which the signatory stated, as more fully cited in Part III above: “[...] the
Government would wish the dispute to be resolved by the ICSID arbitration, as
expeditiously as possible. If the arbitration’s [sic] award shows that we are wrong, we

will of course abide by the result.”

215. The Claimant submits that not only the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is thus established,
but that the Respondent has waived any objection to the jurisdiction of ICSID. The
Respondent, however, in its Counter-Memorial, challenged the jurisdiction of ICSID

and of this Tribunal.

(02) The Parties’ Submissions

216.

217.

218.

The Respondent’s Submissions: As already summarised above, the Respondent
submits that the dispute does not arise out of an “investment” within the meaning of the
ICSID Convention because there was no investment on the part of the Claimant. The
Respondent contends, contrary to the Claimant’s contention, that ICSID jurisdiction is
not only a matter of consent: parties cannot by agreement or waiver confer jurisdiction
on an ICSID Tribunal outside the scope of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.
Therefore, any notion of ‘waiver’ of the right to object to jurisdiction is inapposite.
Article 25 establishes an objective jurisdictional standard. That standard is either met

or not met; and if it is not met, no alleged ‘waiver’ can cure such defect.

That the parties may not elect to submit disputes to the Centre that are not related to an
investment has already been recognised in several ICSID awards.* A distinction must
be drawn between consent to arbitration (on the one hand) and the objective conditions
of an investment (on the other); and the existence of the former cannot allow parties to
evade the latter. As has been stated, the jurisdiction of ICSID is conferred by the
ICSID Convention; and consent to arbitration is little more than the mere agreement to
submit to ICSID under the terms of the Convention.> If this Tribunal were to decide
that the mere signing of an ICSID arbitration clause is a waiver as to the requirements
of Article 25, the Respondent submits that this would entail the consequence that the
fundamental concept upon which application of the ICSID Convention rests (that of

investment) could vary indefinitely and infinitely.

Turning to the objective determination of an investment, the Respondent relies on
ICSID jurisprudence and on legal doctrine, from which there emerges five hall-marks

of an investment: (i) duration, (ii) regularity of profit, (iii) element of risk, (iv)

4 The Respondent relies notably on CSOB v Slovakia, supra note 3, para. 68, and Joy Mining Machinery Ltd v
Egypt, supra note 3, para. 50. While acknowledging that these cases were brought under bilateral investment
treaties, the Respondent notes that the requirements were the same. The Respondent also relies on “pure”
ICSID cases, such as LETCO v Liberia, supra note 3, and Autopista v Venezuela, Decision on Jurisdiction,
supra note 3.

* Mitchell v Democratic Republic of Congo, Decision on Annulment, supra note 3.

substantial commitment and (v) significant contribution to the host state’s
development.° These hallmarks, so the Respondent states, must be applied
cumulatively to the actual activities of the claimant in the respondent state, on the one
hand, and the commitment contemplated by the agreement that provides for the parties’

consent to arbitration, on the other.”

In the present case, the Respondent first denies that the Claimant contributed anything
of substance in furtherance of the Agreement; it further contends that even if one were
to consider what RSM had undertaken to do in the Agreement (rather than what it

actually did), RSM falls short of meeting the above hallmarks.*

As regards the actual expenses allegedly made by the Claimant in performance of the
Agreement, the Respondent argues that they are irrelevant inasmuch as these were
incurred in furtherance of what was only a preliminary agreement. In order to be taken
into consideration, any expense allegedly incurred by RSM should have been made
after 12 January 2004, the moment when the Claimant revoked force majeure; until that
date, performance of the Agreement was impossible; and only a putative agreement
existed. Any expenses made, or allegedly made before that time, therefore, were pre-
investment expenditures. It is all the more so, the Respondent notes, in regard to the

seismic studies conducted before 1996, as early as 1971.

A preliminary agreement cannot itself constitute or form the basis of an investment, as
the Respondent submitted [D1.97]. In the present case, between the preliminary
agreement and the declaration of force majeure, the Respondent contends that there was
a window of only fourteen days; and even the expenses alleged by the Claimant were

not made during that period [D1.135].

The Respondent here relies in particular on Mihaly v Sri Lanka, where jurisdiction was
denied on the tribunal’s finding that the intention to create a contractual relationship

was lacking. Similarly, so the Respondent states, the Agreement was but a preliminary

 Counter-Memorial, para. 3.2; Salini v Morocco, supra note 3, para. 52.

7 Counter-Memorial, paras. 3.13, 3.27 et seq.

* “In order to determine whether this case fulfils the jurisdictional criteria in Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention, one must look at both the actual and the contemplated commitment made by RSM (...) [b]oth of
these must amount to an ‘investment’ in order for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction to hear the present dispute.”

agreement contemplating a license under which the actual operations would be carried

out, whether relating to an Exploration or Development Licence [D1.122].

In any event, the Respondent adds, the expenses alleged by the Claimant after the date
of the Agreement are far too unsubstantiated to allow this Tribunal to find that an
investment was made; in fact, there is no proof of any money spent by the alleged
investor and the alleged investments have not been documented. The brief 2000
seismic trip conducted on behalf of Mr Grynberg was a one-off and fortuitous
engagement. Regarding the litigation against PDVSA and Trinidad & Tobago, not only
is there no evidence whatsoever of the monies allegedly spent by RSM but these
actions were undertaken without the authority of Grenada and thus constituted an
interference with its foreign policy; and any expense so incurred can hardly be regarded
as representing a contribution to the host state as an investment within its territory. In
the absence of any substantial contribution by the Claimant, the Respondent adds, no

risk whatsoever was incurred by the Claimant as regards any “investment.”

Regarding the activities contemplated by the Agreement, the Respondent argues that
these likewise fail to fulfil the recognized hallmarks of an investment: RSM never made
any substantial commitment, took practically no risk and contributed nothing to
Grenada’s development. As the award in MHS v Malaysia and the Mitchell v DRC
annulment decision emphasized, a substantial contribution or commitment is a cardinal
feature of an “investment” in light of the purposes and objects of the ICSID
Convention. Although the Agreement contemplated a potential of eight years of
exploration and fifty years of exploitation, the Respondent argues that RSM did not
even commit itself to pursue exploration according to the Agreement; the Exploration
License was for an initial period of four years (Article 3.2), during which RSM was
only committed to spend US $400,000 on what would essentially be desktop work;
after which, the Exploration License could be renewed for two further periods of two

years each on application made by RSM (Article 4).

Based on expert evidence submitted in this case, the Respondent states that a serious
drilling and exploration program for an area of the size covered by the Agreement

would involve expenses in the vicinity of US $40 million, so that, given the nature of

the industry, the minimal financial commitment undertaken by RSM cannot seriously

be considered as an investment.

As to further expenses, they were contingent upon the exercise of the option by RSM to
pursue exploration work, then development. RSM was free to make or not to make an
application to those ends, and that application had to be consistent in form and
substance with Grenada’s 1989 Act. The Respondent insists that it cannot suffice to say
that oil exploration requires hundreds of millions of dollars to be carried out; what
matters is the actual commitment, not what is spoken of. The Claimant did not in fact
promise anything that could be relied on; all it did was to lock up Grenada’s national
territory indefinitely, putting itself in the position of a broker in search of a more

serious operator to bring in the necessary resources [D1.129].

The Respondent concludes that any commitment here was at most superficial or
speculative, as were risk and duration, not to mention the complete lack of any positive
impact on the host state’s development (villages, roads, schools etc.). The Respondent
adds that the mechanism of ICSID is being abused by the Claimant in this case; that the
Arbitration Agreement is a “pathological arbitration agreement,” an arbitration clause
that necessarily fails to bestow any jurisdiction upon this Tribunal,” because the present

claim is a purely contractual claim with no investment.

The Claimant’s Submissions: As also summarised above, the Claimant contends that
the Respondent expressly consented to the jurisdiction of ICSID in Article 26 of the
Agreement, where, in addition, RSM is expressly designated as an investor (see above).
In further correspondence with RSM, the Respondent confirmed its commitment to
ICSID arbitration as well as its characterisation of the project as an “investment.”'”

The Claimant contends that Grenada thereby waived any right to challenge the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal, under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1). The Claimant adds
that the Parties’ acceptance of ICSID’s jurisdiction is a recognition that their
transaction constituted an investment; or at least it creates a strong presumption that it
is an investment, as was found by the Tribunal in CSOB. This is indeed the reason why

the drafters of the Washington Convention did not find it necessary to insert a

definition of an investment in the ICSID Convention. The Claimant submits that only
if there is serious doubt about the existence of an investment should a tribunal look

further into the matter.

The Claimant does not deny that an investment must meet certain objective
characteristics, while adding that the parties have a wide latitude in reaching that
objective. The Claimant states that only where the assertion of jurisdiction would be
totally inconsistent with the purpose of the ICSID Convention should jurisdiction be

declined by an ICSID tribunal.

In the present case, the Claimant submits that the existence of an investment is so
obvious that the Respondent’s challenge is tainted with bad faith. Contrary to the
Respondent’s assertion, the Claimant notes that the five elements identified by
commentators and adopted by several ICSID tribunals are not regarded as a mandatory
checklist or as true jurisdictional requirements, but as indicative of an investment only.
In any event, the Claimant states, concession agreements such as the present Agreement
unquestionably meet all the suggested characteristics of an investment, notably due to
the expenses involved, the risk undertaken and the major impact on the host state’s

economy.

Regarding the Agreement, the Claimant notes that a financial commitment is not even
necessary, because the provision of services or know-how, not involving a physical
transfer of funds, can constitute sufficient commitment to constitute an investment. !!

In any event, RSM’s actual commitment under the Agreement was substantial as to the
provision of seismic data and of negotiation and litigation expenses incurred in order to
resolve Grenada’s boundary disputes with Trinidad & Tobago and Venezuela (with
Grenada’s authorization, at least to a certain point in time). The further commitment to
spend US$ 400,000 was stated as a minimum; and much more would have been
expended had RSM been granted the Exploration License and Grenada’s ownership
over the disputed zone been recognised by its neighbouring States. A vast amount of
technical know-how was also contributed by RSM, through Mr Grynberg’s expertise

and experience, for instance in finding investors for the development of the project. In

232.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 74 of 159

any event, RSM argues, what Mr Grynberg has done or has not done is not the proper
approach: ICSID tribunals do not have to evaluate the actual contribution of an
investor. (RSM also points to a contradiction in Grenada’s position, blaming RSM for
doing nothing in furtherance of the Agreement after having forbidden RSM to collect

seismic data when Mr Grynberg asked the permission to do so.)

Even accepting (for argument’s sake) the Respondent’s analysis as to a “preliminary
agreement,” the Claimant contends that pre-contractual expenses should not be
disregarded by the Tribunal since they are the first stage of the project. The Mihaly
decision does not stand for what the Respondent contends, because the tribunal there
found that no agreement at all was ever entered into by the parties. Moreover, the
tribunal expressly insisted that, in other circumstances, similar expenditure could be
described as an investment; and here (in the present case) there was an Agreement

amounting to a form of concession between the Parties.

(03) The Tribunal’s Analysis

233.

The Tribunal here first determines to what extent the Parties’ execution of an ICSID
arbitration clause in the terms of Article 26 of the Agreement establishes the
jurisdiction of ICSID, finding that it creates at least a presumption in favour of the
existence of an investment. The Tribunal then decides upon the existence in the present
case of an investment, concluding that the Agreement qualifies as such and therefore

that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the Parties’ dispute on the merits.

(04) The Parties’ Characterisation

234.

The Tribunal first notes that the Parties to the present dispute expressly referred to the
project as an investment and to the Claimant as an investor in the Arbitration

Agreement, agreed and signed by them; and that by inserting an arbitration clause

72

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 75 of 159

referring potential disputes between them to ICSID, they must necessarily be assumed
to have intended that such a clause would operate and that RSM’s part of the project

represented at the time an investment in their own minds.

235.

an

This Tribunal, however, like several earlier ICSID tribunals, subscribes to the concept
that a private party and a state contracting with each other are not at liberty to create
their own definition of an investment under the ICSID Convention with the effect of
bringing a dispute under the jurisdiction of ICSID even where their operation is clearly
not an investment.'? There are certain objective elements to an investment which must
be present; and it is the duty of this Tribunal to ensure that they are present, lest its
assertion of jurisdiction be false and amount to an abuse of power. As the ad hoc
Committee decided in Mitchell, “before ICSID arbitral tribunals, the Washington

Convention has supremacy over an agreement between the parties” (paragraph 31).

236. The Tribunal, therefore, is required to ascertain the existence of the generally accepted
characteristics of an investment, at least inasmuch as they are contested by the
Respondent.'* The Tribunal, however, is of the opinion that while the parties to an
agreement cannot arbitrarily confer jurisdiction upon ICSID by characterizing as an
investment a project that lacks all the characteristic features of an investment, their
express designation of ICSID as the arbitral forum in which to settle their potential
disputes indicates that the parties themselves perceived their agreement as one relating
to an investment.'* The agreement to the jurisdiction of ICSID in a transaction
between a state and a foreign private party thus can be viewed as a presumption that the

transaction is indeed an investment. '*

”? See, e.g., Salini v Morocco, supra note 3, para. 52; CSOB v Slovakia, supra note 3, para. 68.
'8 See Bayindir v Pakistan, supra note 3, para. 133: “Since Pakistan has not contended that the project was not
sufficiently extended in time to qualify as an investment, the Tribunal considers that this requirement is met.”
'4 Similarly, as one ICSID tribunal noted (while concluding that there was no investment for the purpose of
Article 25), “the fact of the registration of [a] case as [an] ICSID Case constitutes an indication that, on the basis
of the information contained in the request for arbitration, the dispute is not manifestly outside of the
jurisdiction of the Centre.” Mihaly v Sri Lanka, supra note 3, para. 57.
'S The CSOB tribunal arguably meant exactly that when it stated that “[t]he Parties’ acceptance of the Centre’s
jurisdiction with respect to the rights and obligations arising out of their agreement therefore creates a strong

ion that they considered their ion to be an i within the meaning of the ICSID
Convention.” CSOB v Slovakia, supra note 3, para. 66. This Tribunal only notes that the “strong presumption”
is not so much that the parties “considered” their transaction to be an investment, which they did, but that it is
indeed one. In the present case, the Respondent expressly denied “alleging that the parties’ intention plays no
role at all in determining whether an investment has been made.” Rejoinder, para. 2.16.

Indeed, when acknowledging that the ICSID Convention did not include a definition of
the term investment (as recalled above), the Executive Directors of the World Bank
added: “... given the essential requirement of consent by the parties.” That qualification
is a way of stating that the parties to an agreement know what they are doing when they
agree to submit potential disputes between them to a forum dedicated to the

adjudication of investment disputes, such as ICSID.

Therefore, the Tribunal does not adhere to the Respondent’s repeated argument that
what a minister subscribing to an ICSID clause might be deemed to have accepted
“does not matter” [D1.117]. The Tribunal is of the opinion that only where the
economics of the disputed transaction are clearly lacking one or more of the recognized
characteristics of an investment should an ICSID tribunal decline to enforce the parties’
will and find that it has no jurisdiction; other than that, the true abuse of power would
be to defeat their expectations. It is in that spirit that the present Tribunal turns to its

analysis of the recognized factors of an investment, on the facts of the present case.

The Existence of an Investment

As several earlier ICSID tribunals have had occasion to note, there is no express
definition of an investment in the ICSID Convention. Those same tribunals seldom
failed to quote from the Report of the Executive Directors of the World Bank,
accompanying the ICSID Convention, which expressly acknowledges the lack of any

definition. '°

However, it appears that a broad consensus has since emerged from ICSID awards, as
well as from legal doctrine, regarding the characteristics establishing the existence of an
investment for the purpose of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.'” The Parties in the

present case have recognized the validity of those characteristics: the Respondent, by

'6 “No attempt was made to define the term ‘investment’...” (1 ICSID Rep 28).

'” 4 number of those cases, unlike the present, were brought on the basis of a bilateral investment treaty, some
of which contained a definition of what was to be considered as an investment for their purposes. Inasmuch as it
refers such cases, the Tribunal is careful to restrict itself to those parts of the decisions which dealt specifically
with the requirement of an investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

arguing that they were missing, a least in part; and the Claimant by affirming their
presence. As recalled by the Respondent (see above), those characteristics are: a
significant commitment of resources by the private party, an economic risk entailed, a
sufficient duration of the operation, a regularity of profit or return and a contribution to

the economic and social development of the host state.'*

The Tribunal recognises the soundness of those general characteristics, while noting
that they do not constitute “the jurisdictional criteria in Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention” or “the Article 25(1) test” as the Respondent refers to them.'? Thoroughly
absent from Article 25, they are but benchmarks or yardsticks to help a tribunal in
assessing the existence of an investment, and their proponents or users rightly insist on

the flexibility with which they should be used by a tribunal.

In the Tribunal’s view, there is no doubt that if the project between the Parties had
reached what was termed in the Agreement the “development” stage (following the
“exploration” stage), the recognized conditions of an investment would be fulfilled. An
oil concession granted by a state to a foreign private party is indeed the quintessential
investment operation.”’ Under the most commonly accepted notions, an agreement
whereby, on the one hand, a state confers upon a private party the right to search for
natural resources while, on the other, the private party undertakes to commit the

necessary means to that end, is undoubtedly an investment.

There would be no need for actual expenses to have been incurred by the private party,
the relevant criterion being the commitment to bring in resources toward the
performance of such exploration. The Tribunal further notes that not only is an
exploration agreement not significantly distinct in nature from the agreement to exploit
known resources, but if anything, it is even more of an investment on the part of the

private party given the magnitude of the commercial risk involved. Exploration for oil

'8 Christoph Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2001), at pp. 121-134, 140. The decision on
jurisdiction in Salini v Morocco endorsed those criteria, while adding: “In reality, these various elements may be
interdependent.” Salini v Morocco, supra note 3, para. 52. The Salini decision has been followed on this point,
notably in Bayindir v Pakistan, supra note 3.

'° Counter-Memorial, paras. 3.27, 3.28.

°° Tn contrast, the facts of Joy Mining, on which the Respondent relies and where the tribunal found that it
lacked jurisdiction, bear little relationship to the present situation; there, the issue was whether a guarantee
issued by the claimant to a state-owned company could constitute an investment for the purpose of Article 25(1)
of the ICSID Convention.

in maritime areas, as the Respondent points out, requires the commitment of a
significant amount of capital. Had the Exploration Licence been issued, RSM would
have been irrevocably committed to bring in, directly or indirectly by turning to other
sources, the necessary capital.”! If oil was not found, or was not found in sufficient
quantities, or was found to lie in locations that did not make exploitation economically

viable, that capital would have been spent in vain.”

This, the Tribunal notes, shows that the recognized characteristics of an investment
need not be met cumulatively. If the exploration proved unsuccessful, the “regular
return” factor would be missing. As to the contribution to the economic and social
development of the host State, in the unlikely situation where the exploration expenses
themselves would not be sufficient to satisfy it, the condition must be assessed in
consideration of a successful adventure. It is not the actual or the final contribution that

matters, precisely because the exploration may not lead to exploitation.

Turning to the State’s perspective, it was in Grenada’s public interest to ascertain
whether the country had commercially viable resources in offshore petroleum. To sum
up, even considering the exploration stage only, the subject-matter of the Agreement

was a “readily recognizable” investment.”

Performance of the Agreement, however, did not reach this exploration stage; and the
Respondent argues that whatever the Claimant actually did or promised to do regarding
the pre-exploration phase of the Agreement lacked all the recognised characteristics of
an investment. In fact, the Respondent does not only apply the “Sal/ini test” to that pre-
exploration phase taken in isolation from the rest of the Agreement; it also applies this
test to individual actions allegedly taken by the Claimant during that stage (which
happened to be extended due to the declaration of force majeure), such as the seismic

trip and studies in 2000.74

lines when it happened to be passing next to Granada [sic], cannot constitute an investment in accordance with
Article 25(1). Such a one-off and fortuitous engagement is lacking in all five of the required criteria: duration,
risk, regularity of return, commitment and contribution to Grenada’s economy” [Counter-Memorial, para. 3.34].
The Respondent expressed agreement with the principle that “a global view should be employed to evaluate
RSM’s ‘overall adventure,” with “the Salini factors being used to assess the global view” [Rejoinder, para.

XQ

The Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s approach as unduly restrictive and lacking the
support of any legal materials or legal logic. Even considering the pre-exploration
phase as a whole, the Respondent contends that it lacked duration because it was
suspended after fourteen days. The Tribunal finds that, first, the suspension for force
majeure, which is the operative cause for such a short period, was decided pursuant to
an express clause of the Agreement and was not contested but positively agreed in
writing between the Parties at the time.”* For the purpose of identifying an investment,
the Tribunal does not therefore think it right to ignore the period of suspension or what
the Parties agreed during that period. Second, the Tribunal notes that after force
majeure was revoked by the Claimant, the Respondent declined to grant to the
Claimant its requested Exploration Licence and later terminated the Agreement. The
Tribunal therefore decides that the Respondent cannot rely on the short duration of a

period to which the Respondent itself put to an end.

248. The Respondent contends that the Claimant did nothing in furtherance of the
Agreement. The Tribunal considers first, that, under the force majeure clause (Article
24), it was excused from the performance of its obligations once force majeure was
declared; second, that, if the pre-license period is separated from the rest of the project
(as the Respondent contends), the Claimant had no other obligation during that period
other than to apply for an Exploration License, which it did or at least attempted to do

(albeit unsuccessfully).

249. The Respondent further contends that even during the pre-licence period, the Claimant
did not actually undertake any serious commitment under the Agreement because its
only firm obligation (spending US $400,000 during the initial exploration period) was
of little significance in view of the nature of the project; and because any further
expense depended on the Claimant’s option to apply for an extension of the exploration
period. On the first point, there seems to be a wide acceptance, in arbitral jurisprudence

and doctrine, of the idea that the existence of an investment as a requirement for

 

2.11]. However, the Respondent immediately added that “[e]ach individual act that RSM has performed fails to
satisfy the test for an investment under Article 25 [...]” [Rejoinder, para. 2.12).

jurisdiction is not dependant on the amounts actually spent by the alleged investor”°;
and that an investment “may be financial or through work,” including know-how”’ or
industry.”* In the present case, RSM’s know-how and industry were ostensibly
dedicated to the project as soon as the Agreement was signed by the Parties, and both
could have been put to use had the Exploration License been issued by Grenada (in

addition to the necessary contribution of capital).

On the second point, namely the option open to the Claimant after four or six years of
the exploration period to pursue the project or not with a Development Licence, it is
hardly conceivable that a commercial entity searching for oil deposits could be
contractually bound to apply for a further license, let alone an actual exploitation
license, if initial studies, or a first drilling operation, showed that there was no prospect
of any successful exploitation. In the converse situation where the exploration work
disclosed the promise of profitable exploitation, it is equally hard to imagine that a
commercial entity (such as RSM) would deliberately abstain from applying for a
Development License, thereby renouncing any opportunity to recoup its exploration
expenses and to achieve its principal aim in the whole project; and that the Claimant
would not be careful to make an application consistent in form and substance with all

statutory and contractual requirements.

Referring to the detailed provisions of Article 8 of the Agreement (“Discovery of
Petroleum and Development”), the Tribunal notes that the risk was rather for the
Claimant that its application for a Development License be turned down by the

Government as not meeting the requirements there enumerated.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Agreement did include commitments
undertaken by the Claimant relating to the exploration period that qualified as an

investment, for the purpose of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

The Respondent also maintains that, beyond the fact that the Agreement lacked the

essential features of an investment, it was but a preliminary or preparatory agreement,

not susceptible by itself to constitute an investment for ICSID jurisdictional purposes.
While the Arbitration Agreement would have been enforceable once a Development
License was issued (although not the Exploration License), the contention is that this

Arbitration Agreement had no application pending the grant of that licence.

This argument, the Tribunal notes, rests on a strict separation within the Agreement
between that part which relates to the phase leading to the application for the
Exploration License and the further parts relating respectively to the exploration and
development periods; so that the Arbitration Agreement would apply to disputes
relating to the third (and possibly second) periods, but not the first. The Tribunal finds
that such separation is inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the Agreement. It is
indeed commercially absurd, an intention not to be attributed to the Parties without very
clear contractual language (which is entirely missing in this case); and it is not

consonant with the purposes of the ICSID Convention.

Even if the Agreement’s provisions relating to the grant of an Exploration License were
to constitute only a “preliminary agreement” within the Agreement, the Tribunal
considers that they were a fundamental part of an overall project. As the Tribunal in

the CSOB case stated:

“An investment is frequently a rather complex operation, composed of various
interrelated transactions, each element of which, standing alone, might not in all cases
qualify as an investment. Hence, a dispute that is brought before the Centre must be
deemed to arise directly out of an investment even when it is based on a transaction
which, standing alone, would not qualify as an investment under the Convention,
provided that the particular transaction forms an integral part of an overall operation
that qualifies as an investment.””

The Tribunal agrees with this juridical approach.

In the present case, the first phase resulting from the organization of the project under
the Agreement can hardly be dissociated from the rest of the transaction. In fact, one
does not find in the Agreement any formal separation between the terms relating

respectively to the pre-exploration period, the exploration period and the development

period: they all form a single and overall agreement. The exploration and development
periods merely represented two phases of one project; their distinction came about not
because the Parties regarded the Agreement as tentative, provisional or even
preparatory but, quite understandably, because of the uncertainty regarding the

existence of oil deposits in sufficient quantity in Grenadian waters.

Therefore, the Tribunal cannot subscribe to the Respondent’s statement that: “RSM has
failed to point to any larger transaction of which [the actions taken by RSM] form part,
and which would itself constitute an ‘investment.””*° The Agreement spells out in
detail all the undertakings of the Parties from its signature to the end of the projected
exploitation, so that it cannot be termed in any sense a “preliminary agreement.”*! And
there is no indication whatsoever that that the Parties intended to isolate the period of
no more than ninety days that was to separate the execution of the Agreement from
RSM’s application for an Exploration License under Article 3.1 (had not force majeure
been declared) as a specific period during which the Arbitration Agreement would not
apply; or that, if a dispute arose as to the timeliness of the application for the
Exploration License, as actually happened here, that the dispute would not fall under

the Arbitration Agreement that ostensibly covered the entire Agreement.

Moreover, even following the Respondent’s invitation to distinguish a series of separate
agreements within the Agreement regarding, first, the ninety-day (at most) period, then
the exploration period, then the development period, such piecemeal agreements were
by no means tentative agreements with each Party retaining total liberty not to enter
into a contractual relationship; the Parties were already committed under the same
Agreement. As was decided in Mihaly: “Ultimately, it is always a matter for the parties
to determine at what point in their negotiations they wish to engage the provisions of
the Convention by engaging into an investment.”*”

There is nothing in the evidential materials before this Tribunal to indicate that in the

Parties’ minds the situation immediately resulting from the execution of the Agreement

was so distinct from that which would result from the grant of a licence (be it the
Exploration Licence or a Development Licence) that they were to be separated out as
regards the manner of resolving their possible disputes and differences in regard to their

Arbitration Agreement.

In particular, the Respondent has not suggested that it had no intention to submit itself
to the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal should a dispute arise regarding the grant or
non-grant of an Exploration License or any other incident related to that early period.
The present situation is thus plainly distinct from that in the Mihaly case, where the
tribunal emphasised the fact that the respondent state “clearly signalled, in the various
documents which are relied upon by the Claimant, that it was not until the execution of
a contract that it was willing to accept that contractual relations had been entered into
and that an investment had been made.”** In the present case, the Respondent’s
conduct from the moment when difficulties arose between the Parties until its Counter-
Memorial in the present arbitration evinces its conviction that the ICSID arbitration
clause was fully applicable from the moment the Agreement was executed and that it

was applicable to the whole of the relationship between the Parties.

Additionally, the basis of the Claimant’s claim here is that the Respondent wrongly
refused to issue the Exploration License that would have allowed the Claimant to carry
out the project as contemplated by the Agreement. Irrespective of the merits of that
assertion, that allegation is sufficient for the Tribunal designated to arbitrate disputes
between the Parties (had a license been issued) to assume jurisdiction over such
dispute. To decide otherwise would permit a party to paralyze an arbitration clause by
refusing to perform a complex agreement from the outset. Specifically, the state party
could retreat from an overall agreement immediately after it was signed, as the ink was
drying on its contractual promises, and renege on an otherwise valid and subsisting
ICSID arbitration clause. Such a consequence does not run only against all legal and
business logic; it runs contrary to the whole object and purpose of the ICSID

Convention.

The Preamble to the ICSID Convention states that the Convention was entered into by
the Contracting States “considering the need for international cooperation for economic
development.” A major aspect of such cooperation was the establishment of a neutral
forum, as an encouragement to foreign investment. Denying the application of an
ICSID arbitration clause, in a situation such as the present case, would undermine the
legal certainty and predictability attaching to such clauses without satisfying any
discernable purpose, even to the benefit of host states in general. Indeed, it would most
likely operate to their detriment by discouraging a number of potential investors. Only
where the enforcement of an agreed arbitration clause would, in the particular
circumstances, defeat the legitimate expectation of the state party should the clause be

treated as “pathological.”

The Tribunal does not find that this is the case here, where, in particular, the
Respondent did not challenge the jurisdiction of ICSID until almost three years after the

Claimant filed a request for arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement.

In summary, the Tribunal considers that the project embodied in the Agreement was an
“overall adventure” from the execution of the instrument by the Parties; and there is no
need even to give a broad meaning to the concept of investment (as certain ICSID
awards and decisions have done) to find that RSM’s part of the project was from the
outset an investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Therefore, the period
leading to the award of the Exploration License should not be separated out from the
rest of the Agreement for jurisdictional purposes, unless the Parties clearly intended

otherwise. There is no trace in the Agreement of any such intention.

In arriving at its decision, the Tribunal is conscious that it has differed from the result
reached by the distinguished ICSID tribunal in MHS v Malaysia, on which the
Respondent relied so heavily. However, every case is potentially different; the issue of
an investment’s existence is materially fact-specific under Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention; and the case before this Tribunal is indeed different. It is not therefore
necessary for this Tribunal to consider whether it is also possible that that ICSID

tribunal’s decision was erroneous.

266. For all these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s jurisdictional challenge and
declares that all claims made by the Claimant lie within ICSID’s jurisdiction and the
competence of this Tribunal, as also all the Respondent’s counterclaims, under the
Parties’ Arbitration Agreement and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. In these
circumstances, therefore, the Tribunal decides this Issue A in favour of the Claimant

and against the Respondent.

PART VI: ISSUE B- REMOVAL OF FORCE MAJEURE

(01) Introduction

267.

268.

269.

The Claimant and the Respondent each allege that the other violated its contractual
obligations under the Agreement to remove the conditions of force majeure that
suspended the Agreement for nearly seven and a half years, from 1996 to 2004. This
Issue B turns, as already indicated above, upon the contractual interpretation of Article

24.2[A] of the Agreement, as legally applied to the facts found by the Tribunal.

The force majeure event, according to the Claimant, was the “dispute as to the
Government [of Grenada]’s ownership of or control over the petroleum in any portion
of the Agreement Area.”** Under Article 24.2, RSM had an obligation during this
period to “take all reasonable steps to remove the cause” of the force majeure, an
obligation that RSM expressly acknowledges.** RSM submits that it fulfilled its
obligations under Article 24.2 by assisting Grenada with its maritime boundary
negotiations. RSM also argues that Grenada’s refusal to endorse its litigation strategies

amounted to a violation of Article 24.2 of the Agreement by Grenada.

Grenada in contrast argues that RSM’s actions in relation to Trinidad & Tobago and
Venezuela were severely detrimental to the resolution of Grenada’s negotiations on
maritime boundaries, so much so that RSM “breached Article 24.2, entitling the

Government to terminate the Agreement and claim damages.”*°

The Parties both seek damages for breach of Article 24.2, but the Respondent also

relies upon the breach alleged against RSM as a ground for terminating the Agreement.

Article 24.2 of the Agreement

Article 24 sets out the grounds on which RSM can invoke force majeure to excuse
performance of the Agreement. The potential breadth of Article 24.1 is striking. It
could be interpreted as excusing performance of all obligations by RSM, indefinitely.*”
As a result the obligation to correct the force majeure situation imposed by Article 24.2

[A] would appear to be fundamental to the Agreement.

Yet several features of Article 24 and other provisions of the Agreement lead the
Tribunal to conclude that the relevant obligation, although important, is not a condition
or condition precedent of the Agreement. Moreover, given the use of the phrase “take
all reasonable steps,” Article 24.2[A] does not impose an absolute obligation on RSM

but only an obligation to use its best efforts to remove the cause of such force majeure.

First, the potential of Article 24.2 to be considered a condition is substantially
diminished by the fact that Article 24 as a whole does not include any agreed time limit
for the duration of a force majeure period in regard to the Agreement’s efficacy. The
Parties have not here provided that the Agreement should lapse if the force majeure
situation persists beyond a certain period of time. This was no oversight by the Parties
but the deliberate result of their negotiations, as summarised in Part IV above. The
quality of the obligation on RSM to remove the cause of a force majeure is likewise
substantially weakened by the nature of force majeure itself. By its general nature,
force majeure lies outside the parties’ control and their power to remove it. Rather,
Article 24.3 requires the Parties to meet where “a force majeure situation continues for

more than thirty (30) consecutive days [...] in order to review the situation and to agree

>? According to paragraph 77 of the Claimant’s Memorial, the boundary ‘disputes’ between Grenada and
Trinidad & Tobago and Venezuela were so crucial to its ability to perform the Agreement that their continuation
allowed RSM to be excused from all of its obligations under the Agreement. See also the Second Witness
Statement of Mr Grynberg, para. 18.

on the measures to be taken for the removal of the cause of force majeure and for the
resumption, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, of the performance of
the obligations hereunder.” Article 24.3 is limited, however, by that fact that no
provision is made for a situation where the Parties cannot agree on the measures to be
taken. Nor does Article 24.3 establish any time limit for the resumption of performance
of the Agreement. As a result, Article 24 itself does not expressly prevent a force

majeure situation from continuing indefinitely under the Agreement.

Second, the wording of Article 24 does not provide any express ground for the
unilateral termination of the Agreement, either alone or in conjunction with any other
provision of the Agreement. Thus, Article 27, which sets out grounds for termination
of the Agreement, does not include any of the force majeure events identified in Article
24. Rather, Article 27.1 deems the Agreement to have been terminated if “by reason of
expiration, surrender or cancellation the Company no longer holds any Exploration
Licence ... or any Development Licence.” By using the operative words “no longer,”
this provision could not apply to a situation where RSM can no longer receive an initial
Exploration Licence (as alleged by Grenada in this case). Article 27.2 allows the
Minister to terminate the Agreement (a) if an order has been made winding up the
affairs of RSM, (b) if RSM is “In Default” under Section 10 of the 1989 Act, or (c) if
RSM fails to comply with a final award made as a result of arbitration proceedings
pursuant to Article 29 of the Agreement. None of these circumstances has arisen in the

present case.

Third, the obligation imposed under Article 24.2 to “take all reasonable steps to remove
the cause” of force majeure events cannot be meaningful in relation to several of the
events contemplated in Article 24. RSM could not be expected realistically to correct
global market prices for petroleum products, nor could it remove the cause of “natural
phenomena or calamities; epidemics; fires; wars; invasions; blockades; riots; strikes;
insurrections; labour disturbances; acts of God; [and] inevitable accidents.” In such
circumstances, it is difficult to consider the obligation imposed by Article 24.2 as
amounting to a condition, at least in relation to all of the force majeure events

contemplated in the Agreement.

Fourth, the Tribunal notes that RSM’s actual obligation under Article 24.2 in the
present case, namely, taking all reasonable steps to remove the obstacle of unresolved
maritime boundaries and adverse claims over petroleum resources, could not have been
achieved unilaterally by RSM. Even if RSM had done everything within its power in
funding the “border delineation process,” reimbursing Grenada for costs incurred for
“third party services in establishing its ownership and control of the petroleum in the
entire Agreement Area,” and in “supply[ing] personnel, legal team and contacts to
obtain the best benefits for Grenada either through negotiation or the International
Court of Justice,” it would not necessarily have been able to resolve Grenada’s
maritime boundaries.** To the contrary, maritime boundary delimitation requires the
agreement of sovereign states, not individuals or companies. Thus the obligation
imposed upon RSM by Article 24.2 itself depended inherently upon inter-state
cooperation between Grenada on the one hand and, on the other, Trinidad & Tobago or
Venezuela for its successful fulfilment. Further, it must be noted that Grenada’s
maritime boundaries could have been resolved without any assistance from RSM,
making the performance of the Article 24.2 obligation potentially extraneous to the

boundary delimitation.

Lastly, the Tribunal notes the qualifying word “reasonable.” This introduces a
significant measure of appreciation, dependent upon the circumstances of the particular

conditions of force majeure and other matters.

These five factors are supported by evidence that RSM’s fulfilment of its Article 24.2
obligation was unnecessary for the future performance of the Agreement. As accepted
by both Parties, the force majeure situation may have excused non-performance by
RSM, but it did not prevent performance, for example as regards areas in Annex A and
Annex B not affected by maritime boundary negotiations with Venezuela and Trinidad

& Tobago.

countersigned by Senator Bubb: see the chronology in Part IV above.

As the Respondent itself recognises, performance of the Agreement was not conditional
upon the resolution of Grenada’s maritime boundaries. From the Respondent’s
viewpoint, RSM’s agreement to fund and assist boundary delimitations was not
essential to Grenada’s acceptance of the force majeure clause without a clearly
stipulated time limit, since the force majeure clause requires a causal connection
between the force majeure event and RSM’s inability to perform the Agreement.*? In
this way, the Respondent argues that the force majeure clause could not operate to
remove ail of the obligations on the part of the Claimant. Some of these obligations
could have been performed even without fully resolved maritime boundaries. The
Agreement provides for exploration and exploitation of oil and gas in all of Grenada’s
potential maritime territory, not only the contested areas close to Venezuela and
Trinidad and Tobago. In the Tribunal’s view, therefore, the Claimant could have
performed its full range of obligations under the Agreement in non-contested areas
within Grenada’s maritime territory. It is significant that RSM claims to have in fact
performed several of its obligations under the Agreement in spite of the force majeure

period.”

Finally, although the Respondent may have initially relied upon Mr Grynberg’s
expertise in relation to maritime boundary negotiations, it recognises that the failures in
the maritime boundary negotiations were based upon the attitudes and entrenched

negotiating positions of Trinidad & Tobago and Venezuela.

It is uncontested that to a large extent this lack of resolution stems from the negotiating
positions of Trinidad & Tobago and Venezuela, both of whom rely upon the principle
of the natural prolongation of the continental shelf and do not accept a median line
position as the starting point for delimitation. The natural prolongation principle is
termed the “continental shelf principle” by Mr Auguste, and described in his first
witness statement in paragraphs 50-51, as follows: “... Venezuela has historically
asserted that the starting point of any negotiations on the maritime boundary should be

the continental shelf principle. Grenada sits on the continental shelf that extends from

Auguste, para. 17.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 91 of 159

the coast of Venezuela. Venezuela considers the shelf to be part of its ‘patrimonial
rights’ — a kind of heritage that cannot be given up. This has made negotiations
extremely difficult, because agreeing to the delimitation method proposed by
Venezuela as a starting point would mean in practice that the negotiations would begin
with the presumption that the maritime boundary runs quite close to the Grenadian
coast [...]. This having remained the Venezuelan position to this date, the assertion
made by Mr Grynberg in his Witness Statement that ‘Venezuela has no intention to

assert itself beyond the mid-point line’ is certainly wrong.”

For all these reasons, the Tribunal determines that the Agreement does not support the
conclusion that the Article 24.2 obligation was a condition precedent to the Parties’
further performance of the Agreement; and it manifestly does not impose a sufficiently
precise, clear and complete obligation on the part of RSM so as to amount to a
condition under the law of Grenada, any breach of which would entitle Grenada to
terminate the Agreement. Accordingly, whilst a breach of this obligation could sound in
damages, it would require a serious breach, undermining the whole Agreement, to

justify the Agreement’s termination as counterclaimed by Grenada.

The Relevant Facts

In assessing RSM’s performance of its Article 24.2 obligations it is necessary to review
(i) the oral and written agreements of RSM in relation to maritime boundary
negotiations, (ii) the conflicting evidence of Mr Grynberg’s expertise in the area, and
(iii) the actual actions and statements made by Mr Grynberg for the purpose of

obtaining maritime boundary agreements.

As a preliminary matter, however, in order to place these events in their proper context,
the Tribunal must highlight how uncommon it is to have a private commercial party,

such as RSM, directly involved in maritime boundary negotiations between sovereign

on

286.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 92 of 159

states. Private, foreign oil companies are rarely involved in sensitive and delicate
matters such as maritime boundary negotiations because of the high potential for

conflicts of interest.

Mr Paul Tauecchio’s Expert Report, adduced by Grenada, states (at page 9):

“... Finally, it is highly unusual that a company is allowed - much less obliged - ‘to take
all reasonable steps to remove the cause of the force majeure’, when the force majeure
is a human-controlled factor such as international boundary delimitation. This can only
lead to a conflict of interest, because the operator’s commercial interests will almost
inevitably differ from the host government's political and diplomatic interests. In any
case, where boundary delimitation is concerned, the involvement of a foreign company
will almost surely - as it apparently proved in this case - be unacceptable to the other
parties to the boundary delimitation process.

I have been involved in offshore exploration and development throughout the world,
and it is not uncommon to find that maritime boundaries have not been established
between two states. I have never seen a situation in which a representative of a private
oil company, particularly one from a third country with a commercial interest in the
disputed zone, has been directly involved in the bilateral negotiations on boundary
delimitation. I understand that the Government has taken the position in this case that
RSM advised the Government that RSM, or Mr Grynberg personally, could be of

if in blishing intei Lb daries between Grenada and
both Venezuela and Trinidad & Ti obago. If that position is correct, I would regard such
advice as having been unreasonable and, to the extent relied upon by the Government,
misleading and counterproductive. Certainly, if what RSM had in mind when it
allegedly so advised the Government was legal proceedings of the kind RSM eventually
undertook (purportedly on the Government's behalf) against PDVSA, Petrotrin and
Trinidad & Tobago, RSM should have known that this was an unprecedented approach
without any significant likelihood of contributing to a quicker resolution of the
boundaries.”

The Tribunal accepts this expert evidence.

The Tribunal concludes that maritime boundary negotiations are held between
sovereign states; that such negotiations tend to be strictly confidential and formal in
character; and that they are conducted by high level diplomatic delegations and

specialised negotiating teams. They also can take considerable periods of time. Mr

90

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 93 of 159

Auguste, for example, offers a useful description of maritime boundary negotiations in

his first witness statement (paragraphs 43 & 44):

“43. In my experience, there is a certain protocol that governs boundary negotiations.
They start with political agreement between the heads of state on the commencement of
negotiations, followed by an exchange of diplomatic notes expressing interest and
setting up a time for the negotiations to begin. This will then lead to negotiating teams
being set up and a first session being held.

44. There is little point in getting into the technical details, such as engaging

hyd hers to try to blish a defensible b dary, before there is broad
agreement on the method of delimitation. For example, Venezuela is holding out on the
ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),
because it wants to use the continental shelf theory to delimit its maritime boundary
with Grenada, whereas UNCLOS, which Grenada has ratified and is therefore bound
by, specifies the median line as the basic point of departure for maritime boundary
delimitation negotiations.”

 

The Tribunal accepts this evidence.

287. Asa result, any involvement by RSM in such processes, as a private party pursuing its
own commercial interests, must be regarded as highly unusual by any ordinary state

practice in boundary delimitation negotiations.

288. The Tribunal also notes that any negotiations related to territory or natural resources are
of necessity negotiations concerning the vital sovereign interests of states. Territorial
sovereignty is one of the most fundamental characteristics of statehood.*' Further,
under international law, it is well established that states are recognised as having

permanent sovereignty over their natural resources.”

State as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population;
(b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with other states.” See also

RSM’s Agreements to Assist Grenada

As a first step in fulfilling its Article 24.2 obligation the Claimant agreed, verbally and
in writing, both before and at the same time as RSM’s notification of the force majeure
event, to assist the Government of Grenada with its maritime boundary negotiations.

Mr Flaxman, on behalf of RSM, wrote to the Government by letter dated 29 May 1996:

“We have suggested that up to $400,000 of the initial exploration commitment may be
used to reimburse the Government and our expenditures in the border delineation
process, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in our written offer to the
Government dated December 29, 1995, a copy of which is attached hereto. In addition,
we verbally agreed that we would supply personnel, legal team and contacts to obtain
the best benefits for Grenada either through negotiation or the International Court of
Justice. We can add this paragraph to the attached side letter dated December 29,
1995. We know, however, from the experience of other countries, and from your own
experience with Trinidad and Tobago, that border delineation is a very lengthy
process. We also know that Grenada and the other concerned States have complete
control over both the timing and cost of securing a final border agreement, which
would make any third party agreement to fund all costs to completion extremely
unwise.”

Two weeks after signing the Agreement, Mr Flaxman formally reiterated RSM’s
commitment to assist in Grenada’s maritime boundary delimitations in his ‘force
majeure’ letter of 18 July 1996, addressed to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of

Finance, in the following terms:

“In negotiations RSM has agreed to reimburse to the Government such direct costs and
expenses, not exceeding US $400,000, as may be incurred by the Government for third
party services in establishing its ownership and control of the petroleum in the entire
Agreement Area, although RSM has reserved the right to terminate, in its sole
discretion, such reimbursements at any time. For its part, the Government of Grenada
has agreed vigorously to pursue all appropriate means for establishing its ownership
and control of such petroleum, and has further agreed that any reimbursement amounts
paid to it by RSM in connection with third party services shall conclusively be deemed
proper expenditures in connection with the Initial Exploration Period which shall

directly reduce the minimum expenditure required under Article 4.1(a) during the
Initial Exploration period.”

It will be recalled that this letter was accepted, agreed and signed by Senator Bubb for
Grenada.

Both of these statements committed RSM to assist Grenada with its maritime boundary
delimitation processes. Yet neither ‘agreement’ reveals a firm and unequivocal
commitment on the part of RSM to assist Grenada. The first statement suggests that
RSM’s funding will be limited; and the second that it may be terminated at any time.

That was promising with one hand but removing the promise with other.

Mr Grynberg’s Expertise

Substantial evidence was adduced by both Parties on the alleged expertise or lack of
expertise of Mr Grynberg in the specialist area of maritime boundary delimitation.
Much argument and evidence were also led by the Parties on the nature and effect of
the actions that RSM (with Mr Grynberg) undertook in relation to both Venezuela and
Trinidad & Tobago.

Regarding expertise, the Claimant submits that Mr Grynberg was greatly experienced
in matters of maritime boundary negotiation, having “earlier assumed such a role on
behalf of Panama.”*? Mr Grynberg himself states at paragraph 29 of his second

witness statement:

“29. It was always agreed that I would assist Grenada in resolving the disputes with
Trinidad & Tobago and Venezuela. I have a great deal of experience in resolving such
disputes in the past, and am still actively involved in boundary resolutions around the
world. The Government agreed to appoint me as its Special Envoy for negotiations with
Venezuela. However, when Mr Bowen became involved he withdrew this status and
refused to allow me to play any part in the negotiations with Venezuela. Prime Minister

Mitchell verbally agreed that RSM should fund the costs of negotiations and litigation
in resolving the boundary disputes. This agreement was confirmed in writing. I had
agreed with Senator Bubb that if necessary RSM would fund and manage international
litigation before the International Court of Justice or the International Tribunal for the
Law of the Sea, in order to help resolve the boundary disputes. Senator Bubb agreed
with this suggestion and was happy for us to do this as it was clearly in Grenada’s best
interests — especially as we had agreed to fund the litigation. Yet, when we commenced
such proceedings against Trinidad & Tobago before ITLOS, Mr Bowen refused to give
the Government's consent, once again frustrating our efforts to get the disputes
resolved.”

The Respondent, in contrast, strongly contests Mr Grynberg’s expertise. As

summarised by Mr Auguste in his second witness statement:

“20. At the time he began his involvement with Grenada and its boundary delimitation
exercise, Mr Grynberg was unaware of the technical issues involved, or how the whole
process was institutionalised and formalised. Although he had experience and know-
how in geology, and was given “special envoy” status “for the purpose of discussing
issues related to petroleum resources” on this basis, at the time he appeared to be
entirely unfamiliar with the basic concepts involved in boundary delimitation, such as
what the median line or the continental shelf theory as a starting point meant, the
history and substance of Venezuela's approach on these issues, and that Venezuela had
not ratified the UNCLOS.”

In light of this disagreement, the Tribunal next reviews the nature of Mr Grynberg’s

actions in relation to negotiations with Venezuela and with Trinidad & Tobago.

Venezuela

Following the signing of the Agreement and RSM’s letter invoking force majeure, the
Government of Grenada appointed Mr Grynberg “Special Envoy of the Government of
Grenada to the Republic of Venezuela, for the purpose of discussing issues related to
petroleum resources.” Mr Grynberg also was appointed “Adviser to [the Grenada]

Maritime Boundary Negotiations Team, for talks with the Republic of Venezuela.”

In his capacity as special envoy, Mr Grynberg participated in one preliminary meeting

with Venezuelan officials in Caracas in September 1996, together with Grenada’s

94

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 97 of 159

Ambassador Mr Fabian Redhead. It is accepted by both Parties that this meeting left the

maritime boundaries between the two states unresolved.

29)

°

Following this meeting, Mr Grynberg sought to negotiate with Venezuela unilaterally,
without express authorisation from Grenada. Fearing negative repercussions, internal
correspondence was sent by Mr Auguste to Senator Bowen on 15 November 1996,
indicating that such initiatives could not be condoned by Grenada and that Mr Grynberg
must function within the Grenadian team. Specifically, Mr Auguste wrote that:
“Maritime Boundaries Delimitation Negotiations require adequate preparation,
knowledge, expertise and experienced personnel, fully cognisant of the relevant issues
and good negotiators. It is not a simple commercial negotiation/deal, nor is it
dependent on personal contact and overtures, “wheeling and dealing” etc. Team work

is also an essential ingredient/parameter in the formula for success.”

Nevertheless, in 1998, Grenada put forward Mr Grynberg’s name as a member of the
Grenadian negotiation team. This appointment was not viewed favourably by
Venezuela. Venezuela objected to his inclusion on the team, expressing concern that

Mr Grynberg was attempting to involve the USA in the negotiation process.

301

S

Because of the delicate nature of Venezuelan-USA relations, Senator Bowen
subsequently wrote to Mr Grynberg several times in 2001 specifically requesting him
not to involve himself or the U.S. Government further in the Grenada-Venezuela
maritime boundary negotiations. Senator Bowen’s second letter of 3 April 2001,
expressly stated: “Let me reiterate that one condition for facilitating the boundary
delimitation process is that there should be no involvement of any other national or
country besides Venezuela and Grenada in the negotiations. Specifically the Republic
of Venezuela is well aware of your trying to influence the process through certain

channels and has exceedingly strong objections to your or any other participation.”

Mr Grynberg did not comply with Senator Bowen’s requests. This much is clear from
the further letter written by Senator Bowen to Mr Grynberg on 10 April 2001, in which
the Minister warned: “It appears that you still have not accepted the fact that your
actions could lead to the discontinuation of negotiations. I do hope that we can impress

upon you the seriousness of the situation.”

In early 2003, Mr Grynberg again unilaterally attempted to resolve the Grenada-
Venezuela maritime boundary, this time by negotiating directly with Petroleos De
Venezuela (PDVSA), the Venezuelan state oil company. These negotiations were

unauthorised and unsuccessful.

Mr Grynberg then unilaterally commenced a lawsuit against PDVSA in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Colorado in April 2003 in an attempt to pressure
PDVSA and the Government of Venezuela into a maritime boundary settlement with
Grenada. Following the dismissal of the lawsuit by the US Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit, Mr Grynberg wrote a letter to Prime Minister Mitchell in which he
suggested that the litigation had produced a concession on the part of PDVSA in favour
of Grenada’s ownership of the maritime territory. Mr Grynberg wrote that he had
received “an indication that PDVSA wants to settle the lawsuit by declaring that they
have no claim on the offshore territory of Grenada including in the RSM license.” This

was, at best, wishful thinking by Mr Grynberg.

Mr Grynberg testified that his negotiations in relation to maritime boundaries with
Petrotrin and PDVSA, two state owned oil companies, were equivalent to, or even more
effective than, negotiations with the two Governments. For example, in paragraphs 30-

31 of his second witness Statement, Mr Grynberg states:

“30. ... Trinidad & Tobago later backed down from its earlier stance by stating that it
has no interest or rights in Block 21, and this was due to my efforts and at my full
expense. It is ridiculous for the Government to draw a distinction between Petrotrin
and the Government of Trinidad & Tobago. Petrotrin is wholly owned by the
Government. It is effectively just a branch of the Government and it acts in issuing oil
and natural gas concessions.

96

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 99 of 159

31. PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, also later backed down from its
previous claims to parts of Grenada’s territory. Before I decided to halt the litigation in
the US District Court against PDVSA, they informed my legal counsel that although
Venezuela could not publicly back down from the boundary dispute, it would not object
to RSM’s oil exploration and development operations in the Agreement Area closest to
Venezuela. I have never said that this resulted in a formal agreement on delimitation of
the boundary. But that is irrelevant. What I did was to resolve the dispute to the extent
that RSM can now go forwards with its exploration and production activities. Again,
PDVSA is wholly owned by the Venezuelan Government. Grenada’s claim that it is
somehow independent and that its statements for practical purposes are not those of the
Government of Venezuela is nonsense [Citing: Exhibit C-16, Letter from Petrotrin,
Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago to Mr Graven, Counsel of RSM of 5
November 2002].”

305. The Respondent strongly disputed the suggestion by Mr Grynberg, which was repeated
during oral testimony at the Main Hearing, that this U.S. domestic litigation, or even an
informal agreement by an oil company such as PDVSA, could resolve the maritime
boundaries between Grenada and Venezuela. As Mr Auguste testified in his first
witness statement (para. 55), in relation to similar claims about settlement by Petrotrin
on behalf of Trinidad & Tobago (in the first witness statement of Mr Grynberg, para.
12): “The issue of setting [sic: settling] a maritime boundary is a matter between
sovereign states. Mr Grynberg’s reference to Petrotrin’s letter disclaiming any interest
in the area near the median line between Grenada and Trinidad and Tobago is of no

relevance to the issue of the maritime boundary between the two states.”

306. The Respondent emphasises that PDVSA, as a state-owned oil corporation, simply did
not possess the necessary competence under international law to resolve maritime
boundaries between two states. Maritime boundary resolution requires the formal

approval of Venezuela itself and Grenada.*°

307.

308.

309.

In light of this evidence, the Tribunal concludes that Mr Grynberg’s actions in relation
to the Grenada-Venezuela maritime boundary negotiations constituted a breach of

RSM’s obligations under Article 24.2 of the Agreement.

RSM was contractually obliged to take all reasonable steps to remove the cause of the
force majeure; and it was thus obliged to assist in resolving these state’s maritime
boundaries relevant to the Agreement; but RSM, acting by Mr Grynberg, did not act
reasonably. Instead, Mr Grynberg’s actions substantially hindered Grenada’s
negotiations with Venezuela. Mr Grynberg’s unilateral attempts to negotiate with
Venezuela, despite several express communications to the contrary by Grenada,
together with his U.S. lawsuit against PDVSA, did not assist in the resolution of
maritime boundaries between the two states. Rather, as evidenced by the express
rejection by Venezuela of his involvement in the Grenadian negotiating team, Mr
Grynberg provoked outright hostility. In addition there is no evidence to support Mr
Grynberg’s interpretation of PDVSA as having conceded Grenadian ownership of any
maritime territory, either with respect to itself or on behalf of the Government of
Venezuela. Nor could it have done so as a matter of international law without the
express authorisation of the Government of Venezuela. As summarised by Senator

Bowen, “any claim that Venezuela has agreed to a median line is sadly mistaken.”*°

The question remains what effect was caused by RSM’s contractual breach. On the
evidence adduced before the Tribunal, it cannot be said to have deprived the
Respondent of substantially the whole benefit of the Agreement. RSM argues, and
Grenada concedes, that the slow progress in maritime boundary negotiations with
Venezuela “has been largely due to Venezuela.”*” Further, the Respondent accepts

that, overall, Mr Grynberg’s role in the boundary negotiations has been minimal: “If Mr

Grynberg’s antics have played any role, it has not been a helpful one” (emphasis
supplied).** Thus, whilst there was certainly embarrassment and diplomatic difficulties
for Grenada, no cogent evidence was adduced of any injury to Grenada measurable in

money damages to compensate it for RSM’s contractual breach.

Trinidad & Tobago

Mr Grynberg also participated in Grenada’s maritime boundary negotiations with

Trinidad & Tobago.

. Asa first step, RSM “appointed engineers to give specialist technical advice” including

Mr Kirk Hindley, a geological engineer, who made a “delineation” in relation to the
boundary with Trinidad and Tobago. Evidence regarding this delineation, however,
suggests that it was both counterproductive and amounted to a clear breach of RSM’s

Article 24.2 obligation.

Mr Grynberg stated in his letter of 15 December 1997 to Mr Gene Thomas, a former
Minister in Trinidad & Tobago, that he had instructed Mr Hindley “that when preparing
the boundaries, if there was any question in his mind, to lean towards Trinidad and
Tobago because I would like a speedy resolution of the boundary demarcation.” In
other words, Mr Grynberg had instructed Mr Hindley to draw the line in favour of
Trinidad & Tobago rather than Grenada, on whose behalf and in whose interests he

purported to be acting.

The Respondent of course emphasises that Mr Grynberg had no approval for pursuing
such a position so adverse to Grenada. The Tribunal has already noted, in the
chronology in Part IV above, that Mr Grynberg testified at the Main Hearing that his
instruction was a deliberate inaccuracy used to confuse Trinidad & Tobago. Even if
this were the case, there is no evidence to suggest that this curious ‘strategy’ was

communicated to the Respondent, on whose behalf Mr Grynberg purported to be

acting. Again, this interpretation by Mr Grynberg of his own conduct is unduly

generous in the Tribunal’s view, as already expressed above.

In 2000 and 2001, as part of his proposed negotiating strategy, Mr Grynberg
recommended that the Government of Grenada expand the Agreement Area so as to
encroach upon the potential territory of Trinidad & Tobago. This suggestion was
couched in terms of strengthening Grenada’s negotiating position.*” Grenada did not
adopt this position. It was highly likely to have had negative implications for maritime
boundary negotiations between the two states, if not more serious diplomatic

repercussions between friendly countries.

Then, on 16 August 2002, Mr Grynberg wrote to Prime Minister Mitchell stating that
RSM intended to commence an ICSID arbitration against Trinidad & Tobago. RSM’s
intention in doing so was to pressure Trinidad & Tobago into resolving their maritime
boundaries with Grenada. In his letter Mr Grynberg provided the Grenadian Prime
Minister with two options in relation to the intended arbitration, namely, that it either:
(i) join RSM in bringing a claim against Trinidad & Tobago, or (ii) itself be subject to
the same ICSID claim — as a defendant. In other words, under the second option
presented to Grenada, RSM was expressly threatening to bring a claim against both
Trinidad & Tobago and Grenada.” In the same letter Mr Grynberg wrote that if
Grenada did not join him in the first option then “Grenada will have to bear all of the
costs.” In September 2002, RSM prepared a “Statement of Claim” intended for ICSID
arbitration proceedings to be brought by Grenada & RSM as claimants against Trinidad
& Tobago as respondent (without Grenada’s authority), copies of which were sent to
Grenada, Trinidad & Tobago, the U.S. State Department (amongst 12 addresses in all).
In the light of such an aggressive approach, it is not surprising that the Government of
Grenada did not approve of RSM’s initiatives in regard to ICSID arbitration

proceedings against Trinidad & Tobago.

But RSM did not stop here. Mr Grynberg then wrote to Grenada, by letter dated 4
September 2002, designating its two members for the Advisory Committee prescribed
under Article 5 of the Agreement. He indicated, if the Government did not appoint its
Committee members, that “RSM will deem that your silence is your approval and RSM
shall have the right under Section 5.4 of the License Agreement to proceed” with the
ICSID claim against Trinidad & Tobago. On 11 September 2002, without receiving any
response from the Government, RSM filed an ICSID “Statement of Claim” on behalf of
the Government of Grenada, RSM and Mr Grynberg against Trinidad and Tobago and
Petrotrin.*' This Statement of Claim appears to have been later withdrawn, since it was
not registered by ICSID’s Secretary-General. RSM had no authorisation from Grenada

to file any such claim.

Shortly thereafter, RSM prepared a “boundary resolution complaint with the
International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (‘ITLOS’)” against Trinidad & Tobago.”
This claim also was unauthorised by Grenada,** although Mr Grynberg swore in an
affidavit filed with the ITLOS application that “RSM is authorized to represent the
Government of Grenada for the purpose of instituting proceedings pursuant to
[UNCLOS] before any judicial, tribunal, arbitration or other dispute resolution forum
permitted by the UNCLOS concerning a maritime dispute between the Government of
Grenada and The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago including all matters and disputes
that are reasonably related to and/or otherwise arise from the maritime disputes.” This

sworn statement was materially inaccurate.

Following queries from ITLOS about his authority to represent Grenada (which were
not satisfactorily answered), Mr Grynberg sought express authorisation from
Grenada.** Grenada did not authorise the ITLOS Application; and it was never

registered with ITLOS.

319. In relation to these ITLOS proceedings, as with the proceedings against PDVSA in the
U.S. courts, RSM claimed that they were terminated following receipt of a letter from
Petrotrin which stated that “Petrotrin has no interest/right/claim with respect to Block
21.” RSM interpreted this letter as amounting to a formal concession by Trinidad &
Tobago (through Petrotrin, which Mr Grynberg equated with the state) that the area fell
within Grenadian maritime territory.°> Mr Grynberg, for example, testified that the
Petrotrin letter proved that he had resolved the maritime boundary dispute with

56

Trinidad and Tobago.” This testimony was materially inaccurate.

320. Grenada firmly denies that the letter could have any such effect, as did Mr Auguste
(cited above). Rather than amounting to any sort of concession on the part of Petrotrin,
Grenada submits that because Petrotrin never claimed ownership over Block 21, its
response simply amounted to a query as to the reason for Petrotrin’s inclusion in the
ITLOS Application. As a result, according to the Respondent, the letter was never
meant to be — nor could it have been — any form of settlement or concession by
Trinidad & Tobago in favour of Grenada.*” The Tribunal accepts this interpretation of

Petrotrin’s letter.

321. In any event, RSM’s view about the status of the Trinidadian boundary resolution is
contradicted by its own subsequent actions. In early 2003 RSM directly challenged
Trinidad & Tobago for allegedly violating Grenada’s sovereignty over its maritime
territory. On 31 January 2003, RSM wrote to the Prime Minister of Trinidad & Tobago
and to the Executive Manager of Petrotrin in order to protest Petrotrin’s trespass into

“Grenada’s maritime area” and its obtaining “seismic and other geological information

*5 During oral testimony Mr Grynberg went so far as to indicate that Petrotrin and PDVSA could bind their
Governments in relation to maritime boundaries, and that Petrotrin had actually given up part of the potential
territory of Trinidad and Tobago (on the Trinidadian side of the median line), in favour of Grenada. See D3.87-
88 and 91. The Tribunal does not accept the accuracy of this evidence.

*6 First Witness Statement of Mr Grynberg, para. 9: “Trinidad and Tobago recognized those principles [of the
1958 Geneva Convention] and accepted my boundary delineation” [emphasis added]; para. 12: “Petrotrin sent
us a letter stating that they have no claim beyond the boundary which was established through my efforts”
[emphasis added]. See also Mr Grynberg’s oral testimony to the same effect at D3. 83-84.

*’ The Respondent quotes in support the sentence following the above-quoted Petrotrin statement, which says:
“We are of the view therefore that Petrotrin was wrongly named as a Party to [the ITLOS] proceedings.”
Counter-Memorial, para, 2.149-2.150 [emphasis added].

and data covering Grenada’s maritime area.”** RSM purported to be acting on behalf
of Grenada in this letter, which it distributed widely, including distribution to several

foreign diplomatic and government officials and the US State Department.”

322. RSM’s letter was also riddled with serious inaccuracies. Mr Graven, writing on behalf
of RSM, incorrectly stated that (i) the “Country of Grenada granted to RSM an
exclusive offshore license to explore, develop, produce and market oil and/or gas and
associated products,” (ii) that the provisions of the Agreement “authorize RSM to take
necessary action for the benefit of Grenada to protect its maritime areas,” (iii) that
“Petrotrin has trespassed into Grenada’s maritime area,” and (iv) that the “seismic and
other geological information and data covering Grenada’s maritime area” must be
“delivered to the undersigned” [RSM] at the “earliest opportunity.” Contrary to these
statements, no license had been issued to RSM (which had yet to apply for any licence),
and RSM did not possess any right to protect Grenada’s maritime areas. In fact,
Grenada’s maritime territory had not been subject to delimitation and therefore
Petrotrin could not have ‘trespassed’ on Grenadian territory under international law.
Further, the seismic and other data mentioned in the letter had not been claimed by

Grenada; nor had Grenada authorized RSM to receive that data on its behalf.

323. Mr Auguste described this letter as “causing the Government of Grenada serious

political and diplomatic embarrassment,” noting that “[n]o State should have to tolerate

such interference with its foreign affairs.”*!

324. All these actions by RSM were alleged by Grenada to have the “foreseeable effect of

hindering the Government's negotiations with Trinidad and Tobago.” According to

Mr Auguste, one of the consequences of RSM’s litigious activity was that Trinidad &
Tobago imposed as a condition to its entering into “the 2003 negotiations on joint use
of resources” that “Trinidad and Tobago would only agree, if Mr Grynberg would not

be involved in such joint activities.”® This pre-condition speaks for itself.

Conclusion Regarding Trinidad & Tobago

In light of all this evidence, the Tribunal concludes that Mr Grynberg’s actions on
behalf of RSM in relation to the Grenada-Trinidad & Tobago maritime boundary

negotiations also breached RSM’s obligation under Article 24.2 of the Agreement.

Under Article 24.2 RSM was obliged to take all reasonable steps to remove the cause of
the force majeure — to assist in resolving the maritime boundaries. Instead, RSM’s
actions substantially hindered such resolution. RSM authorised false maps that
purportedly favoured Trinidad & Tobago as part of this negotiating process; and RSM
then suggested that the Agreement Area be enlarged deliberately to provoke Trinidad &
Tobago, a friendly neighbouring State. Mr Grynberg aggressively pursued unilateral
legal proceedings before ICSID and ITLOS, even threatening Grenada in the process if
it would not join him in this strategy. Then RSM wrote a threatening letter directly to
the Prime Minister of Trinidad & Tobago, riddled with misleading statements, which
was widely disseminated by RSM to foreign diplomatic and government officials
causing significant embarrassment to Grenada. In addition to the traditionally friendly
relations between Grenada and Trinidad & Tobago, it is necessary to recall that after
Grenada had suffered severe hurricane-damage only a few years previously, its large
neighbour had generously assisted Grenada’s population with emergency and other

substantial aid.

Overall RSM’s secretive, unilateral, unauthorised, crude ‘horse-trading’ approach,
backed up with wild threats and vexatious litigation if unsuccessful, contradicted the

essential principles of maritime boundary negotiations between states, as Mr Auguste

testified. Mr Auguste also testified that: “Mr Grynberg was completely unaware of
these issues, and how a boundary delimitation exercise should be undertaken. He liked
to talk to people who [sic] he considered to have influence, and to cut deals. This was
very unhelpful to our negotiation efforts. He seemed unable to understand that there

were complex issues at play.”™

Even though the lack of success in boundary negotiations cannot be ascribed to RSM
on the evidence before this Tribunal, the adverse risk to good foreign relations between
Grenada and its neighbours caused by Mr Grynberg’s actions cannot by any stretch of
the imagination fall under the category of taking “reasonable steps to remove the cause”
of the force majeure under the Agreement. An indication of the level of annoyance
caused by Mr Grynberg is the fact that both Venezuela and Trinidad & Tobago
expressly asked for him not to be involved in further inter-state negotiations. All of
these actions amounted to breaches of RSM’s contractual obligation under Article 24.2

of the Agreement.

Nevertheless, as acknowledged by the Respondent, Mr Grynberg’s participation in
Grenada’s maritime boundary negotiations was not the proximate cause of their failure.
Rather, Trinidad & Tobago’s position of espousing a continental shelf approach to
maritime boundary delimitation prevented any early agreement between the two states,
as Mr Auguste testified. As a result, the actions of RSM, although amounting to
breaches of Article 24.2 cannot be said to have deprived the Respondent of
substantially the whole benefit of the Agreement. As was the case with Venezuela, if
Grenada and Trinidad and Tobago had been ready to resolve their maritime boundaries,
they could have done so in spite of Mr Grynberg’s behaviour. Nor did RSM cause
Grenada any loss measurable in money damages to compensate for its contractual

breach under the law of Grenada.

The Tribunal concludes that RSM’s actions in relation to the maritime boundary
negotiations with both Venezuela and Trinidad & Tobago violated its obligation under
Article 24.2 of the Agreement. However RSM’s breach did not deprive Grenada of
substantially the whole benefit of the Agreement; thus its breach did not entitle Grenada
to terminate the Agreement; and Grenada has not proven any loss caused by RSM’s

breach entitling it to recover damages from RSM.

Alleged Breach by Grenada

RSM in turn alleges that the Respondent, through Senator Bowen, breached its
obligation under Article 24.2 of the Agreement by failing to cooperate in resolving

Grenada’s maritime boundaries.”

The Claimant contends, for example, that Grenada’s
refusal to give consent to the ITLOS claim against Trinidad & Tobago amounted to a
breach of its obligation: “Proceedings before an international tribunal under the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea could have resulted in a binding ruling
delimiting the boundary between Grenada and Trinidad & Tobago. Grenada was
obliged to cooperate with RSM and to permit RSM to comply with its obligation under
Article 24.2 to use all reasonable steps to remove the force majeure event. Grenada’s,
and in particular Mr Bowen’s, frustration of RSM’s efforts to resolve the boundary

dispute amounted to a clear breach by Grenada of its obligation to cooperate.”

The Claimant takes a similar position in relation to resolving Grenada’s boundaries
with Venezuela.” RSM suggests that “aggressive steps to bring Venezuela before a
court or international tribunal or to secure the involvement of the U.S. Government
were and are the only option for settling the boundary between Grenada and Venezuela

in the near future.””°

This position is contested by the Respondent, which alleges that RSM breached Article
24.2 by not desisting from its interference in Grenada’s maritime boundary
negotiations, after having been instructed to do so.”! The Respondent also contests the
Claimant’s position on other grounds, emphasizing that litigation was not an
appropriate course of action and that, moreover, “joining in RSM’s legally incoherent
cases would have been unthinkable even had litigation been an appropriate course of

jon 972
action.””

Grenada points to the severe inadequacies of the legal positions RSM
adopted in both the ICSID and ITLOS arbitrations against Trinidad & Tobago.”
ICSID Tribunals are not empowered to delimit maritime boundaries. Further, as
explained by the Respondent: “... even if the ITLOS complaint had been properly
drafted, Grenada had many good reasons not to litigate against Trinidad & Tobago. Mr
Auguste and Minister Bowen detail some of the many ways in which Grenada’s people
depend on the friendly relations between the two states. RSM showed no appreciation
of the many competing and overlapping policy objectives that a government simply
must take into account in dealing with matters as complex and sensitive as foreign

relations, interstate litigation and boundary delimitation.”

With respect to Venezuela, Grenada points out that litigation simply was not an option:
Venezuela is not a party to UNCLOS, nor had it ratified the Optional Protocol to the
1958 Geneva Conventions on the Law of the Sea, nor had it accepted the jurisdiction of
the International Court of Justice.’”> Thus no litigation strategy could have been

successful against Venezuela.

Finally, even if litigation could have been useful in either case, the Respondent
strenuously argues that entrusting Mr Grynberg to handle these vital matters would not
have been advisable.”° Senator Bowen, in his Second Witness Statement, summarises

the position as follows:

“20. More generally, I believe that for several reasons it would have been unwise for
Grenada to have participated even in a properly-formulated application for arbitration
(which the application filed by RSM was not) against Trinidad and Tobago in 2002.
First, Trinidad is an important trading partner for Grenada, with trade (especially
agricultural) between our countries being significant for the livelihood of a substantial
number of Grenada’s people. In order not to risk unnecessarily this important
economic benefit, any dispute resolution mechanism we might pursue with Trinidad
should be consensually agreed and as non-adversarial as possible. Given Mr
Grynberg’s method of operation — which was becoming increasingly apparent to us by
2002 — having him in charge of the proceeding plainly would have been an
unacceptable risk. Furthermore, RSM never undertook definitively to pay the full costs
of the proposed ITLOS proceeding. Had we endorsed the ITLOS case, there would
have been a substantial risk that at some point we would be left holding the bag,
saddled with a proceeding we could not afford to pursue and with great economic
damage having been done to us through the souring of our trading relationship with
Trinidad and Tobago.”

Also, put bluntly, the Respondent considered that RSM was simply incompetent to
handle maritime boundary litigation. The Respondent submitted that even if litigation
against its neighbours had been both advisable and feasible, Grenada certainly could
not have entrusted such vital matters to RSM and Mr Grynberg. As submitted in its
Rejoinder: “Consider RSM’s repeated demonstrations that it knew little or nothing
about either jurisdiction or substance in boundary matters. RSM’s Reply refers to a
1996 promise made by RSM ‘to obtain the best benefits for Grenada either through
negotiations or the International Court of Justice.’ This statement confirms that RSM
had no idea what it was doing, as RSM can still offer no explanation of how either state
was to be brought before the ICJ. Actually, at least as of 2003, Mr Grynberg believed
that he was before the ICJ, writing to a deputy leader of a Grenadian opposition party
that he had sued Trinidad & Tobago at ITLOS, a ‘part of the International Court of

Justice.’”””*

In conclusion, Grenada submits that litigation was not an option with respect to
Venezuela, was inappropriate in the context of its relations with Trinidad and Tobago,

and that in any event RSM was demonstrably incompetent to pursue such litigation.

(11) The Tribunal’s Decision

338.

339.

340.

The Tribunal notes that on a textual basis no obligation on the part of Grenada to
cooperate with RSM’s maritime boundary efforts could arise under Article 24.2, since
it is addressed entirely to the Claimant. But such an obligation might arise as a result of
Article 24.3 which imposes a duty on both parties, after the specified time period, “to
review the situation and to agree on the measures to be taken for the removal of the
cause of force majeure.” Although there does not appear to have been any express
‘agreement’ between the two Parties under Article 24.3 as to the appropriate measures
for the removal of the force majeure, an implied duty on the part of Grenada to take
reasonable steps to resolve the force majeure situation might arise; and it is appropriate

here to assume that it did.

Nevertheless, even assuming such a duty, its exercise by Grenada could not extend to
the measures contemplated by RSM. Even if Grenada had an obligation to cooperate in
the delimitation of maritime boundaries between itself and Venezuela and Trinidad &
Tobago, the Respondent is correct in asserting that a sovereign state is not required by
international law to undertake litigation or arbitration for such purposes. Moreover, in
the Tribunal’s view, a sovereign state cannot commit itself to a foreign, private person
to undertake such litigation or arbitration; nor or can a state be required to act

unreasonably or in bad faith.

In all these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that there has been no breach of

Article 24.2 or Article 24.3 on the part of the Respondent.

(12) The Tribunal’s Overall Conclusion

341. Accordingly, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides this issue overall
against both the Claimant and the Respondent. The Tribunal upholds in material part
the respective defences of the Respondent and the Claimant (as respondent to
counterclaim) to this claim and counterclaim respectively. It follows, on different
grounds, that neither Party is entitled to any damages for breach of Article 24.2 of the
Agreement, as here alleged; and it also follows that the Respondent is not entitled to

terminate the Agreement for contractual breaches by the Claimant, as here alleged.

PART VII: CLAIM ISSUE C — EXPIRY OR TERMINATION

Introduction

This Issue C turns, as already indicated above, upon the contractual interpretation of
Article 3.1 of the Agreement under Grenadian law, as legally applied to the facts of the
case found by the Tribunal in Part IV of this Award. (Article 3.1 is cited in Part III,
paragraph 114 above.)

The Relevant Facts

In Grenada’s closing oral submissions at the Main Hearing, the arithmetic of the ninety-
day period under Article 3.1 was said to work as follows: time began to run under the
ninety-day period from the Agreement’s Effective Date of 4 July to 18 July 1996, being
then suspended by RSM’s “force majeure” letter of that date; time then resumed on 13
January 2004 (upon Grenada’s ’s receipt of RSM’s first letter of 12 January 2004
revoking force majeure) running up to 28 March 2004 — being the ninetieth day of the
period of ninety days [D5.133-134]. Accordingly, whether RSM’s application was
made on 13 or 14 April 2004, it was made too late under Article 3.1 of the Agreement.

According to RSM, discounting the period of fourteen days from 4 July to 18 July
1996, the application was made timeously within the ninety-day period, allowing for
the closure of the Government’s offices over the Easter holiday period. Even if these
fourteen days were counted as part of the ninety days, the same result follows, as
submitted by RSM, if the effective date of RSM’s revocation of force majeure is taken
as the date of its second letter dated 27 February 2004 (as opposed to its first letter
dated 12 January 2004). Accordingly, RSM submits that no issue arises as regards
lateness. In any event, a delay of one or even a few days is de minimis, being

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 114 of 159

As explained below, the Tribunal accepts the approach of the Respondent: the ninety-
day period began to run on 4 July 1996 and (allowing for the force majeure period
under Article 24.1[B] of the Agreement) it expired on 28 March 2004. Accordingly,
RSM’s application was made to Grenada after the expiry of the ninety-day period,
whether made on 13 or 14 April 2004. It was therefore made contractually late under

Article 3.1 of the Agreement.

The Tribunal rejects RSM’s submission that the ninety-day period did not begin to run

on 4 July 1996, the date of the Agreement, for the following reasons.

Under Article 24.2[A] of the Agreement, cited above, RSM was required “promptly” to
notify Grenada of the occurrence of force majeure conditions; and it did so by Mr
Flaxman’s letter dated 18 July 1996 to Senator Bubb. RSM did not make any such
notification on 4 July 1996. The Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to advance
the period of force majeure (in favour of RSM) from 18 July to 4 July 1996 by
assuming that RSM was in contractual breach of its obligation under Article 24.2[A].
RSM’s submission flies in the face of both Mr Flaxman’s letter dated 18 July 2006
triggering the force majeure suspension (as agreed with Senator Bubb at that time) and
Mr Grynberg’s letter dated 5 April 2004 where he asserted that the force majeure event
began on 18 July 1996 (and not 4 July 1996).

The Tribunal acknowledges that Monday, 12 April 2004 was a public holiday in
Grenada, with the Government’s offices closed for the Easter holiday period from
Friday, 9 April 2004. However, Easter holidays are an annual event, publicly well-
known in advance; and with a ninety-day period, there is no reason, as a matter of
contractual interpretation or otherwise, to extend the ninety-day period to a longer
period because one or more of the last days are well-known public holidays. As already
indicated above, the Agreement does not distinguish for the running of the ninety-day
period between working days, week-ends and holidays. It might be different if the
period was much shorter or limited to one fixed day being a public holiday; but that is
not this case. Article 3.1 imposed an obligation on RSM to make its application “as
soon as possible” and the ninety-day period was clearly a maximum, given that

Grenada was also required to grant the licence within the same ninety-day period.

112

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 115 of 159

349. The Tribunal also bears in mind that the original period proposed by RSM was a period

35

351.

N

of seven days which was only extended to ninety days in the Agreement at Grenada’s
request for its own internal purposes (see paragraph 153 in Part IV (06) above). As
already found by the Tribunal, this longer period was agreed at the request and for the
benefit of Grenada, not RSM. It remains impossible for the Tribunal to understand,
from all the evidence adduced in these legal proceedings, why RSM could not have
made its application well within the ninety-day period: it required little paperwork.
Moreover, even on its own calculations, RSM had indicated to Grenada that it would
make its application “as soon as reasonably practicable” without waiting to the end of
the ninety-day period in its letter dated 27 February 2004; and it could therefore have

done so before 28 March 2004 without any practical or other difficulties.

The Tribunal has also borne in mind RSM’s letter dated 27 February 2004 in regard to
the calculation of the ninety-day period under Article 24.2 of the Agreement. Even if
(contrary to the Tribunal’s determination above) this letter was delivered to Grenada on
27 February 2004, the Tribunal does not accept RSM’s submission that time resumed
under the ninety-day period only upon receipt of this letter by Grenada because RSM’s
earlier letter dated 12 January 2004 had been sent to the ‘wrong’ person not expressly

designated as the agent for notices to Grenada under Article 29(1)(a) of the Agreement.

First, in the Tribunal’s view, it is clear from this contractual wording that the notice
provision is only permissive (“may”); and the Agreement does not preclude a written
notice or other communication being sent by RSM to another effective addressee for

Grenada, including its Prime Minister (as was the letter dated 12 January 2004).

Second, Article 24.2[B], cited above, required RSM “promptly [to] notify the
Government as soon as conditions of force majeure no longer prevent [RSM] from
carrying out its obligations ....” Accordingly, given the same absence of any material
force majeure conditions prevailing as at the dates of RSM’s two letters, RSM was
required to notify Grenada “promptly” as of 12 January 2004; and RSM could not
properly delay its notice to a later date without violating the Agreement. Thus, delaying
its notice to 27 February 2004 would be a breach of its contractual obligation under

Article 24.2[B] of the Agreement. Likewise, the Tribunal does consider it appropriate

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 116 of 159

to postpone the effective date of RSM’s notice (in favour of RSM) from 12 January to
27 February 2004 by assuming a deliberate breach by RSM of its legal obligation.

The Tribunal concludes that time under the ninety-day period resumed on 13 January

2004, upon Grenada’s receipt of RSM’s letter dated 12 January 2004.

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that the ninety-day period expired on 28 March
2004.

It is next necessary to consider the legal effect of RSM’s late application, on 13 or 14
April 2004 after 28 March 2004, under the Agreement and the law of Grenada as the
applicable law chosen by the Parties by Article 28 of the Agreement, as mandated by
Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.”

Legal Application

It is here necessary for the Tribunal to address the legal materials advanced by the
Parties as a matter of English law, said to be directly applicable as Grenadian law to
this case. In a series of submissions, written and oral, both Parties cited a mass of
English legal authorities said to be decisive on the legal effect of Article 3.1 of the
Agreement. It is however possible for the Tribunal to address these legal materials

within a relatively short compass.

Grenada relied on the expert evidence of Lord Mustill of Pateley Bridge FBA. Lord
Mustill testified as follows in his written opinion; and rather than summarise its effect
in the Tribunal’s own words, it is more appropriate here to quote the relevant passage at

some length [WS1.302, 313]:

” Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides: “The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with

such

rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the

law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of

international law as may be applicable.” Schreuer notes that Article 42(1) “proceeds from the basic freedom of

the parties to choose the law they consider most appropriate for their relationship.” Schreuer, supra note 18, at
p. 558.

114

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 117 of 159

“31. ... As might be expected, the classification of contractual terms is a question of the
interpretation of the contract itself and English law does not lay down prescriptive or
systematic rules in this regard save in particular contexts [Fn 13: A notable example
being the Sale of Goods Act 1979]. Nonetheless a particular approach has been
adopted in relation to contractual time stipulations which present their own special
features. This approach is very much evident from the leading case on the
lassification of such stipulation, Bunge Corp ion v Tradax Export SA [Fn 14

[1981] 1 WLR 711]. In this case, the party in breach of a time stipulation, the
purchaser under an fob contract sought to establish that a provision requiring notice to
be given within a specified time of the probable readiness of the carrying vessel was an
intermediate obligation; with the (so it was maintained) that alth h the
notice was given five days out of time the seller was not entitled to terminate as it
could not show that the breach had deprived it of substantially the whole benefit for
which it had contracted. The House of Lords disagreed: the time stipulation ... was
properly to be regarded as a condition of the contract, so that the magnitude and effect
of the breach were irrelevant. There are several strands to the reasoning in the
judgments but the most important is that the question of classification is one of the
proper interpretation of the contract, a principle best expressed by an ofi-cited passage
in the judgement of Bowen LJ in Bensten [sic: Bentsen] v. Taylor [Fn 15: [1893] 2 OB
274]: “There is no way of deciding that question except by looking at the contract in the
light of the surrounding circumstances, and then making up one’s mind whether the
intention of the parties, as gathered from the instrument itself, will best be carried out
by treating the promise as a warranty sounding only in damages or as condition
precedent by the failure to perform which the other party is relieved of liability.”

 

32. Iwould summarise the relevant principles of English law as follows:-

(1) The question as to whether a time stipulation is properly to be regarded as
a condition of the contract is one of the interpretation of the provision in
question in the context of the contract as a whole and the relevant
surrounding circumstances. In suitable cases the courts should not be
reluctant to hold that a particular provision as to time is a condition,
indeed “they should usually do so in the case of time clauses in mercantile
contracts”. [Fn 16: Bunge Corporation (supra) per Lord Wilberforce at
page 716].

(2) A particular clause is generally to be construed as a condition of the
contract where compliance with it was a precondition of performance of the
contract by the other party. Thus in Bunge itself, Lord Roskill regarded it
as “the most important single factor” in favor [sic] of the sellers’ argument
that they could not nominate the loading port until they had received from
the buyers the notice of the probable readiness of the vessel [Fn 17: Page
729F-H]. As Lord Roskill put it: “I agree with Mr Staughton [Leading
Counsel for the sellers] that in a mercantile contract when a term has to be
performed by one party as a condition precedent to the ability of the other
party to perform another term, especially an essential term such as the
nomination of a single loading port, the term as to the time for the

3

4

(9)

performance for the former obligation will in general fall to be treated as a
condition.”

As Lord Wilberforce explained in Bunge Corporation, the danger in
applying an approach based on “gravity of the breach” reasoning is that it
tends to detract from certainty “the most indispensable quality of
mercantile contracts”. In relation to a time stipulation there was only one
kind of breach possible, to be late, and the questions which had to be asked
were (i) what importance have the parties expressly ascribed to this
consequence and (ii) in the absence of an expressed agreement, what
consequences ought to be attached to it having regard to the contract as a
whole [Fn 18: Page 715 and see also Lord Roskill at page 725]. As Lord
Roskill observed, there are many reported cases where the innocent party
was entitled to terminate the contract for breach of condition even though
he had not been deprived of substantially the whole benefit of the
contracted performance [Fn 19: Pages 724G-725D]. Inquiring as to the
“gravity of breach” only became relevant when it had been concluded that
the particular term in question was not, on the proper construction of the
contract, a condition at all. [Fn 20: Page 726B-D].

A stipulation which relates to the grant, renewal or termination of a
proprietary interest is likely to be regarded as a condition. [Fn 21: see
United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley Borough Council [1978] AC 904
per Lord Diplock at pages 928G-929G].

A conceptually different approach, which the tribunal may decide is
relevant to Article 3 of the Agreement, involves asking whether the
stipulation constitutes a unilateral offer the acceptance of which will bring
into existence a new legal relationship between the parties. A unilateral
offer of this kind is only capable of acceptance strictly in accordance with
its terms and a non-conforming purported acceptance is at best a counter-
offer which the grantor of the option is under no obligation to accept. [Fn
22: A possibility canvassed in United Scientific Holdings (supra)].

33. Returning to the present dispute, whilst many modern forms of clause solve the
problem at the outset by expressly stipulating that for the performance of a particular
stipulation time will be of the essence, no such stipulation is present here but when
considering whether time was impliedly made of the essence and as part of this
adjudication weighing the importance attached to timeliness, the Tribunal will I believe
wish to take into account the words “in no event later than” in Article 3.1.”

It is clear from Lord Mustill’s legal opinion, together with the legal materials there

cited, that a contractual term does not have to contain expressly the words “condition”

or “condition precedent” or “time of the essence” to qualify as a condition or condition

116

359.

361.

362.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 119 of 159

precedent under English law. As regards the last of these concepts, contrary to RSM’s
submission made at the main hearing, the Tribunal concludes that the wording of a
contractual term can impliedly produce that result (making time of the essence) without

expressly so stating, as a matter of Grenadian law.

Although RSM’s conclusions were different from those of Grenada (including the point
decided immediately above), RSM’s legal submissions as to English law were not
materially dissimilar from Lord Mustill’s general approach. In its Reply, RSM first
submitted that “the relevant [English] authorities indicate that the 90 day time limit was
not in fact of the essence — it was neither a condition nor a condition precedent”
(paragraph 92). Applying these authorities to the present case, RSM concluded by
raising the question particular to the present case: “objectively speaking, did the parties
intend strict compliance [by RSM] to be essential?” (ibid). RSM answered that

question in the negative.

As regards the first submission, the Tribunal accepts the juridical force of the several
English judgments cited by RSM, particularly the decisions of the House of Lords
United Scientific Holdings v Burnley [1978] AC 904, per Lord Diplock and Lord Simon
(at pp. 932 & 944) and Bunge Corporation v Tradax [1981] 1 WLR 711, per Lord
Wilberforce (p. 716) and Lord Lowry (p. 720). (Both cases were also cited by Lord
Mustill.)

As these English judgments make clear, the equitable rule has displaced the common
law rule under English law with the result that time stipulations in a contract are not
now generally classified as making time of the essence, subject to certain exceptions.
The first exception is where the parties’ contractual wording is interpreted as making
time of the essence; and the second is where the court or arbitrator infers from the
nature of the contract or its surrounding circumstances that the parties intended their

time stipulation to have that effect.

In certain commercial contracts, given their nature, the English courts have readily
inferred that time stipulations were of the essence: see the historical list in Chitty on
Contracts, (30" ed.) Vol. 1, para. 12-037. (This edition is materially similar to the

previous edition cited to the Tribunal by the Parties). There is however no legal or

117

363.

364.

365.

366.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 120 of 159

factual presumption that time is of the essence in a commercial contract; and a time
stipulation in such a contract may be determined to be no condition precedent or no

condition but merely an intermediate term or warranty.

The Tribunal thus accepts RSM’s first submission as to English law; and it applies
these English decisions as part of the law of Grenada to the concluding question raised
by RSM. The Tribunal also accepts, as submitted by RSM, that the answer to this
question must be found in the actual wording of the Parties’ Agreement, interpreted
with the pre-contractual circumstances in which this Agreement was made by these
Parties. The Tribunal does not understand Lord Mustill, as regards general principle, to

have contradicted this part of RSM’s case in his legal opinion.
The Tribunal begins this exercise with three preliminary comments.

First, Grenada submitted that this Agreement was a major investment contract which
could be classified as a mercantile or commercial contract under English law. RSM
submitted that the Agreement could not be so classified under English law. The
Tribunal recognises that a major investment contract made between an investor and a
state may be somewhat sui generis and should not be equated, for this purpose, with
traditional commercial contracts between private parties, such as FOB sale contracts,
voyage charterparties or other mercantile contracts, as listed in Chitty (supra). That list
does not include any investment contract. The Tribunal therefore accepts RSM’s
submission; and it does not therefore base its decision on the “nature” of the

Agreement.

Second, the Tribunal accepts that the Agreement was a major transaction freely
negotiated between two parties of relatively equal bargaining power, with access to
professional legal advice. The Agreement is not therefore a contract of adhesion or a
standard form imposed by a stronger party upon a weaker party; and it is not, of course,
a consumer contract. There is therefore no cause to refer to different legal principles
applicable to such different situations. In this case, the Tribunal is required under
Grenadian law to apply the true interpretation of the Parties’ own consensual wording
in accordance with well-established legal principles. The Tribunal did not understand

either Party to have submitted otherwise.

118

367.

368.

369.

370.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 121 of 159

Third, the Tribunal does not accept that Article 3 of the Agreement amounts to a true
legal option or offer (as suggested by Grenada) because RSM bore an obligation and
not a choice to apply for an Exploration Licence (timeously). However, as suggested by
Lord Mustill, an application by RSM was intended to produce an Exploration Licence
granted by Grenada, namely a legal instrument bearing a special and different legal
status under the 1989 Act than the Agreement itself (which by itself was not any form
of licence). In that sense, RSM’s obligation was directed at something more than a
mere bilateral contractual result and akin to a proprietary interest or interest in rem.
This factor, whilst not determinative of the issue under consideration, has been taken
into account by the Tribunal in assessing the importance of the need for certainty in the

workings of Article 3 in regard to an Exploration Licence.

The Tribunal returns to the actual wording of Article 3 of the Agreement. As already
noted, Article 3.1 contains three significant phrases regarding the timeliness of RSM’s
application for an Exploration Licence: (i) “As soon as possible ...”; (ii) “but in no
event later than ninety (90) days after the Effective Date”; and “[RSM] shall apply for
...” As indicated above, the Tribunal bases its analysis on the Parties’ own choice of
contractual wording and its ordinary meaning in the English language, taking into
account the Agreement as a whole, together with its relevant circumstances, under the

rules of contractual interpretation provided by the law of Grenada.

In the Tribunal’s view, as a matter of ordinary language, this contractual terminology
unambiguously imposes upon RSM an obligation to apply timeously for an Exploration
Licence within a generous time-period of ninety days where that period is the
maximum time allowed. There is no other reasonable interpretation of the phrase: “but
in no event later than.” This was not therefore a time-period which was vague or
imprecise; and it stipulated not a single day, e.g., the ninetieth day, but a lengthy period

ending on the ninetieth day.

This interpretation is confirmed by other terms of the Agreement and the factual matrix

or circumstances in which the Agreement was agreed by the Parties.

119

373.

374.

375.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 122 of 159

First, it is significant that the ninety-day period is objectively predictable and certain
under Article 3.1 of the Agreement. Its starting date is the Agreement’s “Effective
Date,” defined as 4 July 1996 under Article 1.1(p). The ninety-day period then runs
continuously, subject to the operation of suspension by force majeure under Article 24
of the Agreement. Under Article 24.1, RSM was required to (a) “promptly to notify”
Grenada of conditions of force majeure and (b) “promptly to notify” Grenada when
such conditions ceased. These notices therefore provided the beginning and end of the
suspension period; and being given by RSM and received by Grenada, these provisions
were clearly intended to make the calculation of the ninety-day period, even if

suspended by force majeure, readily calculable by both Parties.

Second, it is significant that RSM is to be the sole master of its own application’s
timing under Article 3.1, within the ninety-day period. This application depends upon
its will alone; and it can choose when to make its application within the time period
without any dependence on Grenada under the Agreement or the 1989 Act. It can make
its application on the first day of the ninety-day period: it did not need to wait until the

end of this period.

Third, RSM’s preparation of its application was not thwarted by force majeure under
Article 24: the draft application could have been prepared by RSM before 13 January
2004 and made immediately thereafter. There was thus no reason to delay the

application to the end of the time period.

Fourth, the application for an Exploration Licence was not a difficult, complicated or
time-consuming document for RSM to draft: it was a relatively small task. It did not
require a day’s work, still less ninety days, and still less so after suspension by force
majeure lasting more than seven years, from 18 July 1996 to 13 January 2004. (It may
be contrasted with the substantial exercise required, under the Agreement and the 1989

Act, in regard to an application for a Development Licence).

Fifth, in contrast to RSM’s application, Grenada could not issue the Exploration
Licence under Article 3 without first receiving that application by RSM, albeit that
having received RSM’s application, Grenada was required to issue the licence within

the same ninety-day period. It therefore makes little sense to construe Article 3.1 as

120

376.

377.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 123 of 159

permitting RSM more than the ninety-day period when its delay beyond ninety days
necessarily entails non-compliance by Grenada with its own obligations under Article
3.1. It is also absurd to do so in the present case, given that the extension from seven to
ninety days was made at the request and for the benefit of Grenada, as established by
the Parties’ pre-contractual dealings (see above). Indeed, the greater task under Article
3.1 was for Grenada to respond timeously to RSM’s application within the ninety-day
period, as the Government and Civil Service (subject to Grenada’s Constitution and the
1989 Act) could require more time to issue the Exploration Licence than RSM to apply

for it.

In the Tribunal’s view, it is manifestly clear from the terms of the Agreement that the
timeliness of RSM’s application was intended to be an important factor for the further
performance of both Parties’ obligations under the Agreement. It was the pre-requisite
to Grenada’s own obligation to grant a licence within the same ninety-day period, i.e.
Grenada could not grant an Exploration License to RSM unless and until RSM has
previously applied for such a licence to Grenada. It is also clear in this case that the
time-period was agreed in order to provide an element of commercial and political
predictability and certainty as to whether or not the Parties would be required to
perform their further obligations under the Agreement. It was not imposed to provide a
remedy in damages to Grenada; and indeed there might not be any or any immediate
economic loss to Grenada if RSM delayed improperly its application for an Exploration
Licence. Damages for breach of contract are thus not the natural remedy to Grenada for

such a breach by RSM.

For all these reasons, having considered the terms of the Agreement as a whole in its
surrounding circumstances, the Tribunal decides, as a matter of contractual
interpretation under the laws of Grenada, that the obligation on RSM to make a timely
application for an Exploration Licence under Article 3.1 is a “condition” and a
“condition precedent” of the Agreement in the legal sense that RSM’s failure to act
timeously within the ninety-day period relieves Grenada from any correlative
obligation to proceed with further performance of its substantive obligations under the
Agreement in regard to an Exploration Licence and also entitles Grenada to terminate
the Agreement under Grenadian law. The Tribunal does not accept that RSM’s

obligation under Article 3.1 is a mere “warranty,” “intermediate” or “innominate” term,

121

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 124 of 159

the breach of which would sound only in damages or only entitle termination by
Grenada if RSM’s breach deprived Grenada of substantially the whole benefit of the

Agreement.

378. Estoppel: As regards RSM’s reliance on estoppels under the law of Grenada, the
Tribunal considers that none of the essential factual prerequisites has been established
by RSM on the evidence adduced in these proceedings. There was no unequivocal
representation by Grenada, nor any common assumption by the Parties; and there was
in any event no proven reliance by RSM. Accordingly, Grenada is not estopped from
relying upon the true interpretation of Article 3.1 of the Agreement, as here determined

by the Tribunal.

379. International Law: The Agreement is a private or civil law agreement between a state
and a legal person which is not a state; these Parties expressly agreed a national system
of law as the law applicable to their Agreement; the Agreement is not a treaty; and
there is no question that the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties does not
apply to the Agreement’s interpretation by this Tribunal. There is of course nothing
untoward in these arrangements; and as a basic exercise in party autonomy, it is the
Tribunal’s duty to respect the Parties’ choice fully, as required by Article 42(1) of the
ICSID Convention. Nevertheless, lest it be thought that the practical effect of the
Parties’ choice leads in this case to any unnatural or idiosyncratic interpretation, it may

be useful to test the issue by reference also to international law, by analogy

380. As is well known, in international law there are three principal methods to establish the
meaning under a treaty: (1) the textual method, (2) the subjective method and (3) the

teleological, or purposive, method.

381.

Textual Method: Under the textual method, as codified in Article 31(1) of the 1969
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,*’ the ordinary meaning of the text is to be

upheld: “A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary

® ‘Article 31 also reflects a rule of customary international law: Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v
Chad), 1.C.J. Reports 1994, p. 6, at pp. 21-22 (para. 41); LaGrand (Germany v United States of America), I.C.J.
Reports 2001, p. 466, at p. 501 (para. 99).

122

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 125 of 159

meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its

object and purpose.”

382. The International Law Commission’s Final Draft Articles and Commentary to the
Vienna Convention [the “Final Draft Articles”] makes clear that the original draft of
Article 31 (then numbered “Article 27”) consciously established the primacy of textual
interpretation.*' The International Law Commission, at page 687, commented: “(11)
The article as already indicated is based on the view that the text must be presumed to
be the authentic expression of the intentions of the parties; and that, in consequence, the
starting point of interpretation is the elucidation of the meaning of the text, not an
investigation ab initio into the intentions of the parties. The Institute of International
Law adopted this textual approach to treaty interpretation. The objections to giving too
large a place to the intentions of the parties as an independent basis of interpretation
find expression in the proceedings of the Institute. The textual approach, on the other

28] has put it, “le texte signé

hand, commends itself by the fact that, as one authority!
est, sauf de rares exceptions, la seule et la plus récente expression de la volonté
commune des parties.” Moreover, the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice
contains many pronouncements from which it is permissible to conclude that the textual
approach to treaty interpretation is regarded as well established. In particular, the Court
has more than once stressed that it is not the function of interpretation to revise treaties

or to read into them what they do not, expressly or by implication, contain.!'°'"*?

383. This strict textual approach, i.e., going no further than the ordinary meaning of the text
of the treaty, is regarded as fundamental in international law. Even though the
International Law Commission, in its Final Draft Articles (at page 685), suggested that
the “process of interpretation is a unity and that the provisions of the article [pow
Article 31] form a single, closely integrated rule,” nevertheless, the article itself

indicates a clear, logical interpretive order in which textual interpretation is primary.*°

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 126 of 159

Article 31, when read in conjunction with Articles 32 and 33 of the Vienna Convention
reveals an interpretive structure in which subsequent practice and the other two
methods of treaty interpretation, subjective and teleological, are supplementary in
nature. They are to be used to assist in the interpretation when the textual method is

insufficient.

Applying the textual method, the text is clear: the ninety-day period is important and is
a condition precedent of Article 3.1 of the Agreement. (No subsequent practice by the
Parties demonstrates any agreement to vary the terms of Article 3.1 of the Agreement

under Article 31(3)(a) and (b) of the Vienna Convention.)

In addition, again by analogy, the two other methods of treaty interpretation, the
subjective and teleological ones, both being secondary in nature, would not change the

result in the present case.

Subjective Method: The subjective method, supported by Article 32 of the Vienna
Convention, looks to the intention of drafters of the treaty. However, as made clear in
Article 32 itself, the subjective method is a supplementary means of treaty
interpretation. It is to be employed to either confirm or determine the meaning of the
text itself, and only where the textual method of interpretation either (a) leaves the
meaning ambiguous or obscure, or (b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or
unreasonable. Because the subjective method only serves this limited role,
international tribunals have often decided that the clear text of a treaty obviates the

need to examine the drafting records, or travaux préparatoires, of that treaty.**

The Tribunal here simply notes that the evidence regarding the pre-contractual dealings
of the Parties does not demonstrate any intention to treat the ninety-day period as a
matter that could be unilaterally waived by either Party, or as something inessential to
the Parties. Moreover, initially, the provision was added to the Agreement at the
request of the Claimant; and the extension of time from seven to ninety days made it

even easier for the Claimant to comply with the contractual time-limit. Lastly, the

negotiated agreement upon the ninety-period evinces a common intention by the Parties
for clarity and certainty as regards the effluxion of time by which an Exploration

Licence would have to be applied for by RSM and, if applied for, granted by Grenada.

Teleological Method: The final, teleological method, sometimes called the “purposive
approach,” aims to interpret the treaty so as best to fulfil its overall object and purpose.
It finds some support in Articles 31(1) and 33(4) of the Vienna Convention, although in
each of these provisions it serves as a ‘last-resort’ method of interpretation: it is either
to be used to confirm the textual interpretation, or used only when both the textual and
subjective methods of interpretation fail, as in Article 33(4). The wording of Articles
31(1) and 33(4) show that the object and purpose of the treaty can only be used as a
guide to the interpretation of, not as a replacement for, the text itself. The interpreter is
to examine the text of the treaty “‘in the light of” or “having regard to” its object and
purpose (rather than, for example, “in accordance with” its object and purpose). In fact,
when the International Law Commission drafted the 1969 Vienna Convention it
specifically linked the object and purpose to the textual context (rather than placing it in

a separate article), precisely to avoid the excesses of the teleological method.

According to T.O. Elias, in The Modern Law of Treaties (at page 83): “The

Commission has deliberately referred to the object and purpose of the treaty as the most
important part of the context, not as an independent element, since the latter course may
lead to distorted interpretations, and open the door to the teleological method that might

result in a subjective and self-interested approach.”*°

Where the text of a treaty is clear, the meaning of this text must be applied; and further
subjective and teleological interpretation is not necessary. As established by the
International Court of Justice in the Competence of the General Assembly advisory
opinion: “[T]he first duty of a tribunal which is called upon to interpret and apply the
provisions of a treaty, is to endeavour to give effect to them in their natural and
ordinary meaning in the context in which they occur. If the relevant words in their

natural and ordinary meaning make sense in their context, that is the end of the

Session, Official Records, p. 170).

matter.”*° Similarly, in the case concerning the Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya v Chad), the International Court of Justice expressly stated (at paragraph

41), that “[i]nterpretation must be based above all upon the text of the treaty.”*”

Examining the Agreement here in terms of its overall purpose, the Tribunal cannot
conclude that the ninety-day period established in Article 3.1 was inessential to the
purpose. In fact, when placed in the context of other provisions of the Agreement,
especially the force majeure provision in Article 24, the ninety-day period provided the
certainty needed to prevent the Agreement from becoming an open-ended ‘option’
exercisable at the whim of the Claimant. In this context, it must be remembered that
according to the Claimant’s case, it was provided with the ability to suspend
unilaterally all its obligations indefinitely, under the Agreement, and that the force
majeure period could be unilaterally terminated by the Claimant at any point, regardless

of whether the force majeure event had in fact ended.

In summary, the same result under the law of Grenada (as under English law) would
apply if the Agreement were a treaty subject to international law: the same clear
meaning of the text of Article 3.1 of the Agreement would be upheld; and it is not
contradicted by any evidence of either the subjective intentions of the Parties, or the

object and purpose of the Agreement itself.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes this Issue C in favour of Grenada and against
RSM. It follows that the Agreement either lapsed on 28 March 2004 upon the expiry of
the ninety-day period under Article 3.1 of the Agreement or terminated upon RSM’s
receipt of Grenada’s letter dated 5 July 2005 terminating the Agreement. It matters not
which for the purpose of Grenada’s claim and Grenada’s defence in these proceedings.
In either event, Grenada was not contractually required to grant an Exploration Licence
to RSM; and the Agreement thus came to an end, imposing no further substantive

obligations on Grenada.

investor confronted by a powerful state. It is neither: this not a case of David and
Goliath. Moreover, RSM (with its legal and other advisers, together with Mr
Grynberg) freely agreed contractual wording and an applicable national law giving
effect to such wording in an important transaction where certainty was an important
factor for both Parties, particularly for Grenada. RSM, as already indicated, was the
master of its timetable; and there is no good or necessary reason why it chose to wait
until the end of the ninety-day period to make its application for a licence. It is not the
function of this Tribunal here to re-write the Parties’ contractual bargain or to introduce
an extra-legal mitigating factor which, whilst benefiting one party, would materially
disadvantage the other party; and it could not do so without manifestly violating its
duty under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, this Tribunal was not
invited to do so by RSM.

As regards Issue F, it follows from the Tribunal’s decision that RSM breached its
contractual obligation to apply timeously for an Exploration Licence under Article 3.1
of the Agreement for which Grenada claims nominal damages in the sum of US $1,000.
The Tribunal considers that Grenada suffered no loss from such breach; and it rejects

this counterclaim for damages.

The Tribunal’s decision on this Issue C renders unnecessary any decision on Issue D.

PART VIII: ISSUE E —- MISREPRESENTATION

(01) Introduction

397.

398.

399.

The Respondent advances the counterclaim of unlawful misrepresentation as a ground
for rescinding the Agreement under Grenadian law, as summarised below. The
Respondent argues that RSM’s intentions from the outset, before the Agreement of 4
July 1996, were in fact materially different from those expressed to Grenada. The
Respondent alleges that it was led to believe that RSM was willing and able to carry out
the exploration and development to be envisaged in the Agreement, as well as the
expertise to assist with negotiating on maritime boundary delimitations. But the reality,
according to the Respondent, was that RSM had no such maritime boundary expertise
and that it planned to lock up Grenada’s territory until the Agreement could be ‘farmed
out’ to other companies, who would do all of the work, pay all of the costs, and take all

of the risks, thereby ‘carrying’ RSM’s interest.

The Claimant denies the existence of any misrepresentation. In the alternative the
Claimant argues that Grenada affirmed the Agreement under Grenadian law, thus

barring any actionable misrepresentation by Grenada in these arbitration proceedings.

The Tribunal decides Grenada’s counterclaim, both as a claim and defence, on the facts
of this case as appears below. The Tribunal thereby avoids certain difficulties in
assessing inconsistent parts of Grenada’s case, i.e., whether it advanced its case only for
fraudulent misrepresentation or also for innocent misrepresentation (both giving rise to
the remedy of rescission at common law); and, as regards the latter, whether it was also
advancing a claim for negligent (innocent) misrepresentation under the United
Kingdom’s Misrepresentation Act 1967, enacted as a statute under English law but not

forming part of the common law in England or Grenada. In any event, as appears

400.

401.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 131 of 159

below, given the Tribunal’s decision on the facts relating to this Issue E, these
difficulties required, ultimately, no resolution by the Tribunal for the purpose of this

Award.

The Factual Basis for Misrepresentation

Grenada’s Case: Grenada contends that RSM misrepresented its intentions and several
important facts that were relied upon by Grenada when deciding to enter into the
Agreement, namely (a) that RSM had sufficient financial resources to fulfil its intended
obligations under the Agreement; (b) that RSM intended to commence work under the
Agreement immediately after its entry into force, (c) that RSM by itself would perform
its Agreement obligations rather than ‘farm out’ all financial risks and contractual
commitments to other entities; and (d) that Mr Grynberg had expertise as a negotiator

in maritime boundary delimitations.

(A) Financial Resources: Regarding the first misrepresentation, the Respondent
submits that RSM does not, and never did, possess the human or financial resources
that were indicated in its communications during the negotiations leading up to the
Agreement. The Respondent points out that RSM did not even exist at the beginning of
the negotiations and that even after it was created (on 11 January 1996), RSM was not
provided with sufficient assets or corporate backing to allow it to perform its
obligations under the Agreement.** Rather, RSM’s shareholders (Mr Grynberg’s three
children, their initials being “R,” “S” and “M”), injected little, if any, capital into the
new company.” The Respondent submits that the ‘negligible and even inconsistent
evidence’ provided by the Claimant regarding its assets does not reveal any serious

financial resources on the part of RSM. According to the Respondent, “the evidence

indicates that RSM is a tiny operation, with a turnover of barely US$ 2 million,

capitalization of US$ 1,000 and no more than 20 employees.””°

Moreover the Respondent submits, on the evidence, that the financial resources that
may have existed, both at the negotiating stage and at the time that RSM applied for the
license in 2004, were those of Grynberg Production Corporation (“GPC”), another
company owned by Mr Grynberg which had no legal relationship to RSM nor any
obligation, or intention, to capitalize RSM.°' The banker’s statement attached to the
licence application described the combined assets of GPC and RSM.” Further, the
personal guarantee was made by Mr Grynberg himself, who the Respondent argues is

unreliable as a guarantor given his history of avoiding creditors.”

Finally, during his testimony at the oral hearing Mr Grynberg revealed that GPC’s
financial resources were in the form of credit, rather than revenue, and that such credit

was already committed to development [D2.27-28].

(B) Commencement Time: Regarding the second misrepresentation, the Respondent
contends that RSM’s statements about expeditious commencement of the exploration
programme, once the Agreement was signed, were misleading. RSM suggested in a
number of documents and communications that they would commence work under the

Agreement shortly after it was signed.**

Mr Auguste, for example, testifies in his Second Witness Statement, at paragraph 8
[WS2.554], that RSM represented that exploration would commence immediately after

the signing of the Agreement: “Mr Flaxman said that Mr Grynberg wanted to secure a

license (or a production sharing agreement, as he had originally wanted) to commence

exploration in Grenadian waters immediately.”*°

(C) Farm-Outs: In relation to the third misrepresentation, the Respondent contends that
RSM never had the intention of assuming any financial risk or of carrying out any of its
obligations under the Agreement. Rather, RSM intended to ‘farm out’ all its risks and
obligations to larger entities who were capable of performing the Agreement. The
Respondent denies any knowledge of this intention on the part of RSM, either prior to

conclusion of the Agreement or for years afterwards.

Mr Auguste states at paragraph 9 of his Second Witness Statement [WS2.554-555]:
“Neither gentleman [Mr Flaxman or Mr Grynberg] ever mentioned farm-outs or farm-
ins during the negotiations. The Government would not have been averse to financial
partners, as we understood that oil exploration is expensive. We were, however,
entering into an agreement with RSM, and we did not expect them to hand over the
exploration and development process to someone else. They said that they had the
necessary financial resources and expertise, which is the reason why we consented to
enter into the Agreement with them. I thought RSM would engage contractors for parts

of the work, but that RSM itself would take responsibility and be in charge.”°°

Regarding RSM’s ‘farm out’ strategy, the Respondent refers to a ‘secret’ farm-out
agreement concluded by RSM in 1998, the “Initial Grenada Inter-Company
Agreement” (also called the “Vintage Petroleum Agreement”). The other parties to this
agreement were Vintage Petroleum, Inc. of Oklahoma, Premier Oil ple of England and
Santa Fe Energy Resources, Inc. of Texas (Devon Energy Corporation later succeeded
to Santa Fe’s interest).°’ The Respondent submits that this Vintage Petroleum
Agreement provided an arrangement whereby the parties would find a large and

experienced oil company (called a “Bell Cow”) to fulfil RSM’s obligations and to carry

°S In his First Witness Statement Mr Auguste states, at para. 32 [WS1.292-293]: “Mr Flaxman certainly gave me
the impression during the negotiations that RSM was eager to start with the exploration as soon as possible.”

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 134 of 159

all RSM’s risks and costs.”*> The Respondent also points to evidence of a similar farm-
out arrangement that RSM attempted to conclude in 2002 with Petro-Canada, under
which Petro-Canada was to assume all of RSM’s financial risks.” Grenada asserts that
RSM eventually found its “Bell Cow,” the Shanghai Offshore Oil Group (SOOG), in
October 2005, after both RSM’s commencement of this ICSID arbitration and

Grenada’s termination of the present Agreement.'”

409. Senator Bowen indicates that the Government was surprised when it found out about
the Vintage Petroleum Agreement. At paragraph 15 of his Second Witness Statement
[WS2.571], Mr Bowen testifies: “[W]e were shocked when we heard (in or about 2003)
that RSM had “farmed out” rights under the Agreement to Devon Energy, in a deal that,
as we now know, provided that RSM would be fully “carried” by Devon and other
companies — i.e., that it would spend no money and do no work itself. (We later heard
that RSM was negotiating farm-outs to other companies, and I understand our lawyers
asked RSM to provide documents on this.) The news about Devon Energy was
completely contrary to RSM’s representations in 1996, and it increased our
apprehension that — in words I recall the Prime Minister using — we had been “sold a

bill of goods” by RSM.”

410. This Vintage Petroleum Agreement ended in litigation without the creation of a further
operating agreement,'°' when RSM began a law suit against the other parties in US
courts. '°* Nevertheless the Respondent alleges that RSM continued its efforts at

farming out its rights and obligations under the Agreement with Petro-Canada.'"

411. The Respondent argues that such an intention to farm-out all of its risks and obligations

on the part of RSM amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation by RSM.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 135 of 159

As summarised by Mr Auguste, Grenada would not have entered into the Agreement
with RSM if it had known it was merely a broker or speculator: “I do not think the
Government would have, or should have, entered into the Agreement with RSM if it
had known at the time that RSM was a speculator — as I now understand it to be —
simply looking at assigning Grenadian maritime territory to other companies, and
taking a cut of the proceeds, without investing its own money, carrying out work itself
or using its alleged expertise for the benefit of the project. RSM was not supposed to
be a broker, but an operator; or at least that is what Messrs Grynberg and Flaxman

represented RSM to be.”!™

In addition, the Respondent contends that if RSM’s ‘farm-out’ strategy proved
unsuccessful the Claimant’s intention was to pursue a litigation strategy against the
companies with which it had ‘farm-out’ arrangements, or against Grenada if it tried to
free itself from the Agreement. The Respondent argues that the modus operandi of
RSM and Mr Grynberg’s other companies is contractually to ‘lock up’ vast territories
with potentially lucrative oil resources and then to profit from litigation when their
partners (corporate and government), wish to develop those resources or end the

relevant contractual relationship. '°>

At paragraph 2.163 of its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent described RSM’s modus
operandi as follows [WS1.129]: “The first step in this modus operandi is to “lock up”
large, and often disputed, territories for long periods of time with agreements that
require little or nothing from Mr Grynberg (frequently because of immediate force
majeure notices). He appears to target governments that lack experience in the oil and
gas business, using a combination of slick salesmanship, glowing promises and
economic threats to procure such agreements. Then, when the time and market
conditions are right, he either “farms out” his contracts to serious players; and/or sues

everyone in sight. [Citations omitted.]”

In support of its case Grenada refers to the “hundreds of cases” in US courts in which
RSM and Mr Grynberg’s other companies have been involved, a partial overview of
which it presented in the Appendix to its Counter-Memorial.'°° The Respondent also
refers to the five lawsuits filed by Mr Grynberg in relation to the present proceedings:
three in US courts, one before ICSID and one before the International Tribunal for the
Law of the Sea.'"’ These proceedings, according to Grenada, have proved very
profitable to Mr Grynberg, “who earlier this year claimed to have made US$ 60 million

from a series of cases he brought against United States energy companies.” !*

The Respondent acknowledges that speculative petroleum exploration and development
agreements of the kind entered into by RSM are not inherently illegitimate or illegal.'”
However such an arrangement was not disclosed to the Government of Grenada during
the negotiation of the Agreement. The Respondent concludes: “Besides agreeing to a
non-assignment clause, they deliberately led the Government to believe that RSM could
and would quickly commence exploration, with development ideally to follow in short

order,”!!

(D) Maritime Boundary Negotiations: Regarding RSM’s fourth misrepresentation as to
Mr Grynberg’s expertise in maritime boundary negotiations, the Respondent submits
that such alleged expertise was “a key representation” because it led to Grenada’s
increasing the size of the Agreement Area.''' However the Respondent indicates that
Mr Grynberg has no such expertise whatsoever and that he was — and remains —

incompetent to perform any such functions.

RSM’s Response: As to the facts, the Claimant denies any form of misrepresentation in

relation to the Agreement.

necessary to carry out its obligations under the Agreement. The Claimant points to the
expenditures incurred by RSM and its affiliates in acquiring and processing seismic
data, together with the significant expenditures by Mr Grynberg in his previous oil

exploration projects.'!”

(B) Commencement Time: Regarding the timing of commencement of activities under
the Agreement, RSM contends that there was a clear understanding on the part of both
Parties that a force majeure situation existed prior to the signing of the Agreement'”
and that the Agreement could not be performed until Grenada’s maritime boundaries

were resolved. |"

Mr Grynberg, for example, in his Second Witness Statement, at paragraph 20
[WS2.437-38], indicates that the Government of Grenada understood and agreed that
the Agreement would be suspended in its entirety upon execution: “Senator Bubb and I
discussed the force majeure provisions and the existence of the boundary disputes and
were agreed that the Agreement would be suspended in its entirety from the date of
signing. We agreed that the Agreement would be signed, that RSM would then invoke
force majeure, and that we would then move as quickly as possible to delimit the
boundaries. Senator Bubb also countersigned the letter which we sent on 18 July 1996
formally notifying the Government of the existence of the force majeure event. There is
no question that the remaining Government officials were already aware of the
existence of the boundary disputes and the force majeure event under the Agreement;
the letter was merely written acknowledgement of this. Senator Bubb’s signature of this
letter acted as formal confirmation to us that the force majeure event suspended all of
our obligations. We relied on this confirmation. If the force majeure event had not
existed there is no question that we would have applied for the Exploration Licence

immediately.

(C) Farm-Outs: RSM denies any representation that it would not engage in farm-out
agreements, which it states are “an absolutely standard business practice in the

international oil industry.” !'°

RSM also submits that the Agreement specifically permits RSM to enter into loan
agreements (Article 23.1(a)), as well as to assign its rights and obligations, either
wholly or in part, provided that Grenada gives its consent (Article 25). In fact the term
“Company” is specifically defined in Article 1.1(i) of the Agreement as including not
only RSM but also any other person to whom the Company has assigned an interest.

(These articles are cited above in Part III of this Award, at pp. 36, 37 & 39.)

In addition, Mr Grynberg states in his Second Witness Statement, at paragraph 25
[WS2.439], that RSM discussed its intention to enter into farm-out arrangements with
the Government: “We also told the Government before entering into the Agreement
that RSM would be farming-out part of its obligations under the Agreement. This is
usual practice in the industry and all oil companies do this — even super-majors like
Shell Oil. I specifically discussed this with both Senator Bubb and Prime Minister
Mitchell. I told them that I always spread my risks — as any sensible businessman

always does. The Agreement expressly allows for RSM to assign our obligations.”

(D) Maritime Boundary Negotiations: Finally, the Claimant stands by its assertion that
Mr Grynberg does have the relevant expertise in maritime boundary delimitations. In
response, Mr Grynberg offered several examples in his oral testimony of cases in which

he had successfully resolved maritime boundaries between states, according to him.'!”

"7 For example, Mr Grynberg testified [D2.157-159] that he had “established a boundary between Barbados and
St. Lucia” and a “floating boundary” between Martinique and St. Lucia. He also indicated that he had been a
“mediator between countries ... between Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, between Greece and Turkey.” Further,
Mr Grynberg testified [D3.21-22] that the reason Venezuela did not want him involved in the maritime
boundary negotiations on the Grenadian team was because he was too skilled in both the technical and legal
aspects of maritime boundary delimitation. This testimony was not corroborated by other evidence in these
proceedings to the Tribunal’s satisfaction.

(03) Grenadian Law Regarding Misrepresentation

426.

427.

428.

It is possible here to address the relevant legal principles succinctly, without much
elaboration. At common law (here including equity), a pre-contractual
misrepresentation which induces the representee to enter into the contract with the
representor gives to the representee the legal right to rescind the contract, subject to
certain conditions. Both forms of misrepresentation at common law, i.e. fraudulent and

innocent misrepresentation, give the right of rescission to the representee.

As a defence to RSM’s claim, Grenada pleads rescission based upon RSM’s alleged

fraudulent misrepresentation: see its relief above, at paragraph 27, page 11.

As already noted above, there were times when, in argument, Grenada appeared to
advance its case more broadly by reference to English statutory law, namely a claim for
negligent (innocent) misrepresentation under Section 2 of the United Kingdom’s
Misrepresentation Act 1967 or even a claim for the separate tort of negligent
misstatement under a pre-contractual duty of care allegedly owed by RSM to Grenada.
However, the Respondent cited the Misrepresentation Act 1967!'* without
demonstrating that it had been extended to Grenada prior to independence and (if it
had) survived as existing law in Grenada.'!? Nor was it submitted that any equivalent
statute was enacted in Grenada subsequent to independence, as occurred in other
Commonwealth states of the Caribbean.'?? As a result, the Tribunal construes these
references by Grenada’s Counsel in argument as a forensic exercise only, without
suggesting that the 1967 Act somehow formed part of Grenadian law or was otherwise
relevant to this case. In any event, the 1967 Act does not affect any common law rule as

to what constitutes an unlawful misrepresentation giving the right to rescind a contract;

and it leaves intact the representee’s right to rescind a contract for fraudulent

misrepresentation.

(It is only in the case of innocent misrepresentation where Section 2 of the 1967 Act

grants to the English court or arbitrator the discretion to limit the representee’s remedy
to statutory damages in place of rescission; and damages were not pleaded by Grenada
as a defence to RSM’s claim, as already noted above. Moreover, a negligent statement
or other breach of a duty of care might give rise to damages but not rescission, as here

claimed by Grenada.)

429. At common law, as correctly summarised by the Respondent, misrepresentation first

requires proof of a statement of fact that is materially false which induces the
representee to enter into the contract.'?! There must be such a statement by the
representor; there must be inducement by the representee; and the statement must be

false; or Grenada’s counterclaim must fail against RSM as a matter of Grenadian law.

430. The traditional rule is that neither a statement of opinion which proves to have been

unfounded, nor a statement of intention which is not put into effect, would be treated as
a misrepresentation.'* However in certain circumstances a statement of intention can
be classified as a statement of fact, and therefore as a ground for rescinding the contract
if, at the time when it was made, the statement was false and it can be proved that the

123

person expressing the intention did not have that intention. For present purposes,

the Tribunal is content to apply this approach.

431. The burden of proof also falls upon the representee to prove the representation and the

121

falsity of the representation and, as regards fraudulent misrepresentation, its fraudulent
character. Under English and Grenadian law, a fraudulent misrepresentation is almost
invariably also a criminal offence. (It is therefore not to be equated with the lesser

“fraud” as a civil wrong under many of the state laws of the United States of America.)

. Under Grenadian law, a representation is false if it is materially inaccurate; and a false

misrepresentation is fraudulent if it is made either “(1) knowingly, or (2) without belief
in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false” (Derry v Peek
(1889)).'*4 A false statement will not be fraudulent, however, if the representor had an

honest belief in its truth.'?°

The representee must also prove that the representation affected his state of mind and
that it induced him to enter the contract.'”° If it is proved that a false statement was
made that was likely to induce the contract and that the representee entered into the
contract, an inference may be drawn that he was influenced by the representation. '””
This is particularly so in the case of fraudulent misrepresentation. Moreover the
misrepresentation need not be the only cause inducing the representee to make the
contract: it suffices if it was one of the causes.'** As explained by Lord Hoffman in
Standard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping Corporation and Others (No.
2) [2003] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 227, even if the representee held some other negligent or
irrational belief, so long as the fraudulent representation was relied upon, the defendant
will be liable: “15. This case seems to me to show that if a fraudulent representation is
relied upon, in the sense that the claimant would not have parted with his money if he
had known it was false, it does not matter that he also held some other negligent or
irrational belief about another matter and, but for that belief, would not have parted

with his money either. The law simply ignores the other reasons why he paid.”?”°

(04) The Tribunal’s Decision

434. In determining the factual basis for the four categories (a) to (d) of alleged
misrepresentation above, the Tribunal notes that all were allegedly made by RSM in
the course of the bilateral negotiations for the Agreement between October 1995 and
July 1996 by the Parties’ legal representatives, including (inter alios), Mr Grynberg, Mr
Auguste and Senator Bubb.

435. (A) Financial Resources: The question of RSM’s financial resources was material to
Grenada’s consent to the Agreement, as was known to Mr Grynberg for RSM at the
time. As acknowledged by Mr Grynberg during his oral testimony, Grenada did not
itself have the resources to develop its own oil and natural gas resources.'*” Grenada
was reliant upon RSM for both technical and financial resources under the

Agreement. BI

436. The evidence demonstrates that RSM’s statements regarding financial resources at least
partly induced Grenada to enter into the Agreement. During the negotiations, RSM led
the Government of Grenada to believe that it was a serious oil company, capable of
undertaking the financial and technical obligations envisaged under the intended
Agreement. RSM made several statements in response to queries about its assets that
led Grenada to believe that these assets included, or were backed by, the assets of Mr

Grynberg and his other companies.

437. For example, in response to a request by Mr Auguste for an indication of the

relationship between RSM and Mr Grynberg’s other companies, '*”

Mr Grynberg stated
that: “RSM is a new company I have formed which is owned by my three grown

children, Rachel, Stephen and Miriam. The intent is that Grynberg Petroleum will be a

guarantor of all expenditures, but in fact, the three children have their own money and it

will be their money that will be invested.”'*

Regarding actual assets held by RSM, Mr Grynberg responded to questions from the
Government by indicating that: “One must rely on the accounts of the Grynberg family
companies....”'*4 The necessary implication of such statements is that RSM
represented itself as having access to the financial resources required to fulfil its

obligations, as envisaged for the Agreement.

However the question is not whether RSM represented itself to have access to financial
resources. The question is whether RSM, as alleged by Grenada, represented itself as
possessing such resources independently of other financial resources — in other words,
was RSM representing itself as being capable single-handedly of funding the

obligations of the Agreement by itself?

On the evidence, no such representation has been established by Grenada. Rather, Mr
Grynberg and representatives of RSM consistently offered vague, ambiguous and
sometimes contradictory statements about RSM’s financial resources; and RSM
provided no concrete materials about its own, independent financial status. These
statements referred to the collective resources of the Grynberg family of companies,
including Mr Grynberg. Such statements implied a connection between RSM and other
Grynberg companies, but the precise nature of the connection and its consequences for

financing were left ambiguous during the Parties’ pre-contractual negotiations.

Likewise, during the main hearing, Mr Grynberg remained less than clear when cross-
examined on the precise financial relationship between RSM and GPC. He testified that
GPC runs RSM, he (Mr Grynberg) is the Chief Executive of RSM, he and his wife
solely own GPC, his three children solely own RSM, GPC is not a shareholder of RSM,

nor RSM a shareholder of GPC, but RSM had access to the finances necessary to

perform the Agreement.'*°

Accordingly, on the evidence, the Tribunal determines that Mr Grynberg intended that
RSM should use the resources of his family of companies and third parties to fulfil its
future financial obligations under the Agreement. That statement was made to Grenada

in different forms at different times. It was not materially false.

There is insufficient evidence of any clear representation that RSM alone would finance
the entire Agreement, without recourse to outside financial resources. Without such a
representation, this first part of Grenada’s case fails on the facts at the first hurdle. As a
result there is no unlawful misrepresentation on the part of RSM related to financing

which can justify rescission of the Agreement.

(B) Commencement Time: The evidence is contradictory in relation to the
representations made by RSM about the commencement of its obligations under the
Agreement. There were several early indications that RSM would commence work
soon; but it was well understood on both sides that the resolution of maritime
boundaries with Grenada’s neighbours was necessary before the Agreement could be
performed in full by RSM. Indeed, that was the reason for the Parties’ choice of

wording as regards force majeure in Article 24 of the Agreement.

In light of such evidence, the Tribunal determines that Grenada has not established any
sufficiently clear representation by RSM for its counterclaim. Accordingly, this second
part of Grenada’s case also fails on the facts at the first hurdle; and there is no unlawful
misrepresentation on the part of RSM related to commencement time which can justify

rescission of the Agreement.

(©) Farm-Outs: It is clear from the evidence that RSM led Grenada to believe that it
could carry out the Agreement. If it had represented that it could do so alone, this

representation would have been false, to Mr Grynberg’s own knowledge.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 145 of 159

. RSM made one representation that it intended to bear all of the expenses under the

Agreement. Mr Grynberg wrote in his letter to the Prime Minister of 2 April 1996:
“We would like to assure you that we very much wish to proceed with the project,
which we believe will be of great benefit to Grenada and its people. Although RSM
will bear the entire risk and expense of this challenging and expensive exploration
39136

project, we believe the potential benefits to all parties justify our undertaking

(emphasis supplied).

However other statements, also made by Mr Grynberg, qualified this statement. Only a
few weeks’ later, for example, Mr Grynberg indicated in his letter to Senator Bowen of
15 April 1996, that RSM intended to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement in
‘partnership’ with other companies: “I will be in London from May 8-17 to meet
colleagues from the oil and gas industry on other matters. It would be helpful if it were
possible to receive an executed agreement prior to that time so that I might then seek
additional partners for this challenging exploration venture” [emphasis supplied].'*”

That statement, cannot reasonably be understood by Grenada as indicating that RSM

still intended (if it ever did) to assume “the entire risk and expense” of the project.

(According to Mr Auguste, the Government did not then understand Mr Grynberg’s
reference to “partners” as changing RSM’s role under the intended Agreement, as
“operator and manager” [D3.206]. The Tribunal does not accept Grenada’s case on this
point: such ‘an operator and manager’ could still conclude ‘farm-out’ and other
arrangements; and, moreover, the Government’s understanding must be assessed also in
the light of its consent to the Agreement’s express provisions regarding assignment,
namely Article 25 and its definition of the term “Company,” as discussed immediately

below.)

. The Agreement, in Articles 1.1(i) and 25, expressly permits RSM to assign its interests.

In Article 1.1(i) of the Agreement the term “Company” is defined as including “any

'36 1 etter from Mr Grynberg, dated 2 April 1996, pp. 3-4 [CB01.307-308].

other person to whom the Company has assigned its participating interest or any part
thereof” (page 36 above). Article 25 of the Agreement, although being phrased in the
negative, permits RSM, with “the prior written consent of the Government, which

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld” to assign “in whole or in part, any of its

rights, privileges, duties or obligations under this Agreement” (page 39 above).

In the Tribunal’s view, these terms are fatal to Grenada’s factual case on
misrepresentation. By 4 July 1996, the Respondent was aware, both from RSM’s pre-
contractual communication (about seeking potential ‘partnerships’) but also from the
plain text of the Agreement itself (the result of its own negotiations and agreement),
that RSM could engage in farm-outs and like assignments, even if RSM did not then
disclose the full extent of its intentions with respect to such transactions with third

persons.

As a result, the Tribunal decides that RSM did not prove any clear representation in
relation to farm-outs. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that this third part of
Grenada’s case fails; and there is no unlawful misrepresentation on the part of RSM

relating to farm-outs which can justify rescission of the Agreement.

(D) Maritime Boundary Negotiations: Before July 1996, Mr Grynberg represented

himself as having expertise as a negotiator in maritime boundary delimitations.

However, as established by the Tribunal, the expertise offered by Mr Grynberg simply
did not exist in fact. As already noted, Mr Grynberg had no relevant expertise in the
area of maritime boundary delimitation; and his actual contribution to any diplomatic

negotiations was likely to be ineffective, as it in fact turned out to be.

The Tribunal determines that Mr Grynberg’s representation was false. The next
question is whether Grenada has proved, as a fact, that it was made fraudulently by

RSM.

144

455.

456.

457.

458.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 147 of 159

In the Tribunal’s view, Mr Grynberg did not commit fraud. In his testimony adduced in
these proceedings, it is plain that Mr Grynberg believes strongly that he has the
necessary expertise and experience to be a successful negotiator for maritime boundary
delimitations. After considering all the evidence, including his oral testimony tested
under cross-examination by Grenada’s Counsel, the Tribunal concludes that Mr
Grynberg honestly believed in the truth of his statements during the pre-contractual
negotiations. In such factual circumstances, fraudulent misrepresentation cannot be

established under Grenadian law.

The next question is whether Grenada has proved, as a fact, innocent non-fraudulent
misrepresentation justifying rescission at common law. The question there arises
whether Grenada has proved the necessary inducement as regards Mr Grynberg’s

misrepresentation.

After reviewing all the evidence, the Tribunal determines that even though Mr
Grynberg’s offers of assistance with maritime boundary negotiations may have
influenced Grenada to enter into negotiations with Mr Grynberg (for RSM) at an early
date, it is not sufficiently demonstrated that those offers later induced Grenada’s entry
into the Agreement. Nor can Mr Grynberg’s offers be characterised as material to
Grenada’s acceptance of the Agreement as a whole, in light of Grenada’s clear
knowledge that maritime boundary negotiations required the agreement and consent of
the sovereign states concerned and could not be concluded single-handedly by a
technical expert, however skilled or experienced, who was a foreigner manifestly self-

interested in the outcome of those negotiations.

On this question, in particular, it would have been useful to hear the testimony of
Senator Bubb, who might have contributed much to the Tribunal’s appreciation of
Grenada’s case. As recorded above, however, Senator Bubb was not made available to
this Tribunal as a factual witness by Grenada; and in those circumstances the Tribunal

is left to decide this question on the evidence without his contribution.

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 148 of 159

Accordingly, for these cumulative reasons, the Tribunal concludes that this fourth part
of Grenada’s case also fails; and there is no unlawful misrepresentation on the part of

RSM, whether fraudulent or innocent, which can justify rescission of the Agreement.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion

For all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent’s counterclaim for
unlawful misrepresentation fails on the facts, as established on the evidence adduced in
these proceedings. Accordingly, it is not here necessary to address RSM’s separate

defence of affirmation.

Accordingly, the Tribunal determines this Issue E against Grenada and in favour of
RSM; and the Tribunal rejects Grenada’s’ defence and counterclaim for rescission of

the Agreement.

PART IX: ISSUE G- DETAILED WORK PLAN

Introduction

It is a fact that RSM did not submit any detailed work plan to the Minister, as required
by Article 6.1 of the Agreement, within thirty days after the Agreement’s Effective
Date of 4 July 1996.

Given the operation of force majeure from 18 July 1996 to 13 January 2004, the delay
from 29 January 2004 to 28 March 2004 (equating to the full “30 days” after the

Effective Date) amounts to sixty days.

Grenada submits that RSM’s breach justifies its termination of the Agreement; and it

also claims nominal damages.

The Tribunal’s Decision

In the circumstances, it is appropriate to decide this Issue G shortly. First, the Tribunal
does not consider Article 6.1 to be a condition of the Agreement under the laws of
Grenada, entitling Grenada to terminate the Agreement for any breach, however minor.
Second, this breach was minor; and it could not justify Grenada’s termination of the
Agreement. Third, Grenada has not established that it suffered any loss from RSM’s

contractual breach; and the Tribunal is not inclined to order nominal damages.

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides this Issue G in favour of RSM and against Grenada.

PART X: ISSUE H - UNAUTHORISED RESEARCH

Introduction

The Tribunal assumes, for present purposes, that RSM undertook unauthorised research
in February 2004, with the operations of the “GSI Admiral” in Grenadian waters in
criminal violation of Section 4 of the 1989 Act, cited in Part III(03) above (paragraph
128, page 40).

The question is whether this criminal violation was also a contractual breach of the
Agreement or a tort under the law of Grenada, sounding in damages as claimed by

Grenada in the sum of EC$ 391,860.00.

The Tribunal’s Decision

As regards a contractual breach, Grenada submits that the Agreement “expressly
incorporates” the 1989 Act (paragraph 4.32 of its Rejoinder (page 65)). The pleaded
reference is there made to Article 2 of the Agreement, which states only that the

Agreement constitutes an agreement made under Section 6 of the 1989 Act.

These are not words of contractual incorporation; and, in any event, these words cannot
incorporate as a contractual term the provisions of Section 4 of the 1989 Act. (The
Tribunal takes no account of the draft Regulations prepared under the 1989 Act because
these regulations remained in draft, were never promulgated, had not acquired the force
of law in Grenada and were not, as such, incorporated into the Agreement by Article

1.1(w) of the Agreement.)

148

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 151 of 159

471. The Tribunal does not accept Grenada’s submission that, implicitly, RSM bore a like
contractual obligation to that imposed by statute under Grenada’s criminal law. Such a
broad implied term in the Agreement has no legal basis under Grenadian law. If it were
possible for Grenada to formulate a different implied contractual term to like effect, it is

significant that Grenada has failed to do so in these proceedings.

472. Nor does the Tribunal accept Grenada’s alternative argument that a violation of the
1989 Act equates with a tort under Grenada law. A crime may also be a tort; but it is
not necessarily so; and Grenada has not established to the Tribunal’s satisfaction, in this
case, that a violation of Section 4 of the 1989 Act is a tort committed against Grenada

sounding in damages.

473. Accordingly, this Issue H is decided by the Tribunal in favour of RSM and against

Grenada.

PART XI: ISSUE I—- RESPONDENT’S RELIEF

The Tribunal here addresses the remedies counterclaimed by Grenada, in the light of
the Tribunal’s several decisions recorded above and Grenada’s prayer for relief, set out

in nine sub-paragraphs in Part I above (paragraph 28, at pages 11-12).

As regards the Arbitration Agreement and sub-paragraph 1, the Tribunal dismisses this
counterclaim for a declaration that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide RSM’s

claims.

As regards the Agreement and sub-paragraphs 2, 3 and 5, the Tribunal decides and
declares that Grenada has not breached any term of the Agreement; that all RSM’s
claims (save costs) are dismissed; and that Grenada’s obligation to issue any
Exploration Licence lapsed and the Agreement was terminated, such that Grenada has

no further contractual obligations to RSM.

As regards sub-paragraph 4, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent’s counterclaim for

misrepresentation.

The Tribunal does not think it appropriate or necessary to grant the further relief
counterclaimed in sub-paragraph 6. The operative part of this Award should suffice to
produce an equivalent result without requiring any intervention by this Tribunal, itself a
procedural impossibility after this Award and the final discharge of this Tribunal’s

jurisdiction.

The Tribunal dismisses the counterclaims for damages in sub-paragraph 7.

As regards legal and arbitration costs, being claimed by RSM and counterclaimed by
Grenada in sub-paragraphs 8 and 9, these are considered separately in Part XII below,

under Issue J.

PART XII: ISSUE J— LEGAL AND ARBITRATION COSTS

Introduction

The Tribunal’s power to award costs in these proceedings derives from Article 61(2) of
the ICSID Convention. It provides as follows: “... the Tribunal shall, except as the
parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with
the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and
expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of
the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.” ICSID
Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) also requires that the award shall contain any decision of the

Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.

There is no agreement otherwise by the Parties; and accordingly, the Tribunal is
required to exercise its discretion as regards the three separate categories of costs: (i)
the apportionment and assessment of the Parties’ own legal costs; (ii) the
apportionment of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal’s three members; and (iii) the

apportionment of ICSID’s own charges.

The Parties’ Respective Submissions

The Claimant: In its Memorial, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to make a
declaration that “ the Government must pay in full the fees and expenses of the
Arbitrators, the ICSID administrative expenses and all costs incurred in connection

with this arbitration by RSM (including without limitation the fees and expenses of all

experts and all legal fees and expenses).”'** Such request was reiterated in the

Claimants’ Reply.

In the Claimant’s final submissions on costs dated 9 July 2007, the Claimant quantified
its claim in regard to its own legal costs in the total sum of US $1,881,316.66, in
addition to any sums paid or payable by the Claimant to ICSID in respect of the
Tribunal and ICSID itself. Its own costs comprised of UK £706,235.03 for Dewey
LeBoeuf, €148,481.08 for Grand Auzas & Associés and US $259,850 for

miscellaneous expenses incurred by the Claimant, including expenses of its witnesses.

The Respondent: In its Counter-Memorial dated 8 December 2006, the Government
requested the Tribunal to render an award “ordering RSM to pay all costs of this
proceeding, including the Government’s legal expert and expert fees and expenses, the
fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and to any experts appointed by the Arbitral
Tribunal, as well as the costs charged by ICSID.” Such request was reiterated by
reference in the Respondent’s Rejoinder dated 25 May 2007.'°

In the Respondent’s final submissions on costs dated 9 July 2007, the Respondent
quantified its claim in regard to its own legal costs in the total sum of UK £896,728.14,
likewise in addition to any sums paid or payable by the Claimant to ICSID in respect of
the Tribunal and ICSID itself. Its own costs comprised of UK £130,000 for DLA Piper,
UK £766, 728.14 for Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (including Lord Mustill) and
UK £22,160.00 for miscellaneous expenses incurred by the Respondent, including the

costs and other expenses of its witnesses.

The Tribunal’s Analysis

It is appropriate initially to consider the Parties’ respective claims for their own legal

costs.

First, the Tribunal considers that the Parties’ claims are reasonable in amount. Indeed
the amounts are comparable for both sides, by itself an indication that neither Party

incurred expenditure at an excessive level.

Second, the Tribunal considers that such costs were reasonably incurred by each Party.
Commercial parties and States do not usually waste money on legal costs when it
remains a distinct possibility that such costs may be borne by them exclusively. This
case was no exception. (The Tribunal addresses separately below the Respondent’s

complaint directed at the Claimant’s conduct in these arbitration proceedings.)

The third issue relates to allocation or apportionment of legal costs as between the
Parties. Neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules contains any
express provision concerning the apportionment of costs between the parties. The
Tribunal therefore turns to the general practices followed in international arbitration,

recognising that such practices do not represent any uniform rule applicable in all cases.

Under an increasingly predominant practice, tribunals apportion costs on the basis of
the success of the winning party in the arbitration, the rationale for such cost-shifting
being the justification (or non-justification) of the time spent by a party in defeating the
other’s case and by the Tribunal in order to adjudicate upon that case: “the costs follow

the event approach.”

Under an equally predominant practice, tribunals may take into account the merits of
each issue presented by the parties, regardless of the overall award: “the issue-based
approach.” Accordingly, even though a claim may succeed overall, the losing party
may have prevailed under one or more important issues representing a major part of the

arbitration as to time and expense.

There is a further practice whereby tribunals make a broader assessment of the
reasonableness of the unsuccessful party: it may have had valid reasons to believe that
the claim was ill-founded; and conversely, an apparently well-founded claim may fail

but the unsuccessful party may have had valid reasons to believe that it would succeed.

These approaches demonstrate generally that, subject to applicable laws and arbitration
tules, tribunals generally enjoy a broad discretion in making decisions on costs to fit the
particular circumstances of the particular case. As regards ICSID tribunals, this is
especially evident from the wording of Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, together
with the well-known commentaries: see Schreuer (supra), pp. 1223 to 1238 and

Gotanda, Supplemental Damages in Private International Law (1998), p. 177.

In applying the Tribunal’s discretion to the present case, it is significant that the
Claimant has failed on its substantive claim, namely that the Respondent be ordered to
pay it substantial damages. The Claimant is therefore, on this basis, the losing party.
The Respondent, however, has failed on most of its counterclaims and, more,
significantly, its jurisdictional challenge. It too, therefore, on the same basis can be

regarded as a losing party.

In this case, therefore, it is more appropriate to apply an issue-based approach. As to
the number of issues, there is a broad equivalence between the Parties as to jurisdiction
and heads of liability for claims and counterclaims. In addition, it is also appropriate for
the Tribunal to note that the Claimant’s principal claim in damages, as regards liability,
was a relatively close call. In the Tribunal’s view, it was responsibly pleaded and
reasonably presented before the Tribunal by the Claimant’s Counsel with a large degree
of persuasiveness, which pays tribute not only to Counsel but also to the Claimants’
case itself. The same can be said of the Respondent’s Counsel on the jurisdictional
challenge and the Respondent’s failed counterclaims. In short, this case was not easy
or obvious; and it was far from the simple, straightforward exercise forensically
suggested by both Parties at the main hearing (albeit to contrary effect). It would be

inappropriate to say more.

The Tribunal has considered the Respondent’s several complaints against the
Claimant’s conduct during these arbitration proceedings. It is certainly correct that the
Claimant did not make this case procedurally easy for the Respondent or, at times, for
the Tribunal. The Tribunal nonetheless concludes that no relevant criticism attaches to
the Claimant for present purposes: its conduct was not motivated by bad faith; this was
an important case for the Claimant (as it was for the Respondent); and given Mr
Grynberg’s litigious nature (as described above), it may be thought that the Claimant
conducted itself in a relatively mild manner overall, influenced by its Counsel. In any
event, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s criticisms as a relevant factor in the

exercise of its discretion on costs.

The Tribunal’s Decision

Accordingly, for the reasons set out above and in the exercise of its discretion under
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant and the

Respondent should each bear their own costs, without any recourse to the other.

For the same reasons, the Tribunal decides that the Parties should each bear 50% of the

Tribunal’s fees and expenses and ICSID’s charges.

PART XIII: THE OPERATIVE PART

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finally awards as follows:

The Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s jurisdictional challenge and declares that
all claims made by the Claimant lie within the jurisdiction of the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and the competence of this

Tribunal, as also all the Respondent’s counterclaims;

The Tribunal dismisses all substantive claims made by the Claimant, including

any claim for interest;

The Tribunal declares that the Respondent did not breach any of its obligations
towards the Claimant under their Agreement of 4 July 1996 in failing to issue an
Exploration Licence to the Claimant, such obligation having lapsed on 28 March
2004 and the Agreement having been lawfully terminated on 5 July 2005 so that
the Respondent had thereafter no further substantive contractual obligations to

RSM;

Save as aforesaid, the Tribunal dismisses all substantive counterclaims made by

the Respondent, including any claim for interest;

The Tribunal decides that the Claimant and the Respondent should each bear

their own costs in full, without any recourse to the other; and

156

Case 1:10-cv-00457-BAH Document 8-1 Filed 06/01/10 Page 159 of 159

506. The Tribunal decides that the Parties should each bear fifty per cent of the
Tribunal’s fees and expenses and ICSID’s charges, as separately notified by

ICSID.
