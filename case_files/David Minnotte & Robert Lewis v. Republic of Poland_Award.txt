INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”’) under the Additional Facility Rules on the
basis of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Poland
concerning Business and Economic Relations, signed 21 March 1990 (the “BIT”, “U.S.-
Poland BIT” or “Treaty’”), which entered into force on 6 August 1994 (the text of the BIT
is attached to this Award as Annex A). The dispute relates to the construction and intended

operation of blood plasma fractionation facilities in Poland.

The Claimants are Mr David Minnotte and Mr Robert Lewis (hereinafter the “Claimants”’),

who are both U.S. nationals.
The Respondent is the Republic of Poland (hereinafter “Poland” or the “Respondent”).

The Claimants and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “parties.”

The parties’ respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 16 July 2010, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Mr David Minnotte, Mr
Robert Lewis, and Plasma Fractionation Laboratory, LLP (“PFL”) against the Republic of
Poland (the “Request”),' invoking the ICSID dispute settlement provision for Additional
Facility arbitration contained in Article IX of the BIT. Subsequently, by letter of 4 August
2010, the parties notified the Centre that they had agreed to suspend the registration of the
Request. On 2 September 2010, the Claimants informed ICSID that they did not wish to

further suspend the registration process of their Request.

By letters of 7 and 13 September 2010, the requesting parties supplemented their 16 July
Request, informing the Centre inter alia that they withdrew the Request for arbitration with

regard to PFL.

' At the time, the Request was filed by PFL and Mr David Minnotte, with Mr Minnotte acting as attorney-in-
fact for Mr Robert Lewis. It was later confirmed that Mr Lewis himself wished to be a Claimant in this
arbitration. See Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, pp. 3-4.

1

On 14 September 2010, the Secretary-General of ICSID approved access to the ICSID
Additional Facility and registered the Request, as amended and supplemented, in
accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. On
the same day, the Secretary-General notified the parties of the registration, and invited
them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with

Article 5(c) and Chapter III of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.

By letter of 14 January 2011, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal be constituted in
accordance with Article 9 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. Pursuant to
that Article, the Tribunal is to consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each

party and the third, and presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the parties.

By the same letter, the Claimants appointed Professor Maurice Mendelson QC, a British
national, as arbitrator, and Professor Mendelson subsequently accepted his appointment.
Following appointment by the Respondent, Professor Eduardo Silva-Romero, a dual
national of Colombia and France, accepted his appointment as arbitrator on 14 February
2011. Further to an agreement reached by the parties, Professor Vaughan Lowe QC, a
British national, was appointed as President of the Tribunal, and Professor Lowe accepted

this appointment on 25 February 2011.

On the same day, i.e., on 25 February 2011, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance
with Article 13(1) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, notified the parties
that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms Frauke Nitschke, Legal

Counsel at ICSID, was appointed to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal held a first session with the parties on 14 April 2011 in London. The parties
confirmed at the session that the Tribunal had been properly constituted, and agreed inter
alia that the applicable rules would be the 2006 Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules in
effect from 10 April 2006, and that the procedural language would be English. It was
further decided at the session that the legal seat of proceedings would be England and that
English law was the governing law of this proceeding. Absent an agreement by the parties,

the Tribunal further determined a schedule for the parties’ written pleadings, including

2

production of documents. With regard to confidentiality, it was further agreed that the
content of the proceedings was to be kept confidential, but may be disclosed to the extent
that the parties so agree. The Tribunal was further asked to rule on the issue of unilateral

disclosure of information by a party of any content of the proceedings.

On 26 September 2011, the Claimants filed a request for provisional measures seeking an
interim order from the Tribunal directing (i) that the Respondent suspend criminal
proceedings instituted against Mr David Minnotte and Mr Robert Lewis until after the
Final Award in this proceeding has been rendered; (ii) that the Respondent take immediate
steps to ensure that no arrest warrants are issued against Mr David Minnotte and Mr Robert
Lewis that could interfere with the conduct of this proceeding; and (iii) that the Respondent
confirm in writing the ability of Mr Zygmunt Niziol, a former business partner of the
Claimants, to attend the oral procedure in this case without fear of arrest or violation of the

terms of his bail..

On 14 October 2011, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimants’ request for
provisional measures. Each party filed a further written submission on this request on 4 and
18 November 2011, respectively. A hearing on provisional measures was held by video-
conference on 23 January 2012. Besides the Members of the Tribunal, who jointly
participated in the hearing from London, and the Secretary of the Tribunal, the hearing was
attended by Claimants’ counsel Messrs David Baron and Joseph Matthews (participating
from ICSID’s office in Washington, D.C.), and by Respondent’s counsel Dr Sabine
Konrad (participating from Frankfurt), and Mr Maciej Jamka, Dr Wojciech Sadowski, and
Ms Katarzyna Szostak-Tebbens (jointly participating from Warsaw).

On 23 February 2012, the Tribunal issued a decision on provisional measures and
Procedural Order No. 1 concerning the organization of the proceeding and specifically the
hearing of evidence. The Tribunal rejected requests for an Interim Order suspending
criminal proceedings and arrest warrants in respect of the Claimants and Mr Niziot
regarding alleged offences which the Claimants consider to arise out of and form part of
their dispute with the Republic of Poland. The Tribunal decided, however, that it would,

inter alia, organize its proceedings in such a way that all parties, including Mr Minnotte

20.

21.

and Mr Lewis, have the opportunity to participate effectively in all sessions held in these

proceedings.

In accordance with the Summary Minutes and further to an extension granted by the

Tribunal, the Claimants filed their memorial on the merits on 7 November 2011.

On 7 May 2012, the Respondent filed its counter-memorial on the merits, a request for

bifurcation and objections to jurisdiction and admissibility.

Following observations by the Claimants on the Respondent’s request for bifurcation of 7
May 2012, the Tribunal issued its decision on this matter on 5 June 2012, deciding to join

the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility to the merits of the dispute.

By letters of 15 June and 18 July 2012, and following an invitation by the Tribunal, the
parties agreed on the procedural calendar for the parties’ further written pleadings, and
subsequently reached an agreement on dates for the oral procedure. However, the parties
were unable to agree on the venue for the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits. In their
correspondence, the Claimants indicated that given the criminal proceedings instituted in
Poland against Messrs Minnotte and Lewis, they feared inter alia possible arrest, at the
instance of a Polish prosecutor, in the event that the hearing were to be held inside the area

of the European Union.

Following several exchanges between the parties and the Tribunal on this matter during the
months of June and October 2012, the Tribunal decided on 23 November 2012 that the
hearing was to take place in Istanbul, Turkey during the week of 15 April 2013.

On 11 September 2012, the Claimants filed a request for production of documents, which
the Claimants subsequently amended on 25 September 2012. Following written
observations by the Respondent, the Tribunal decided on the Claimants’ requests in its

Procedural Order No. 2 of 2 November 2012.

On 30 November and 18 December 2012, each party filed a written submission concerning

certain remaining document production matters. Following a telephone conference held

22.

23.

24.

25.

with the parties on 10 January 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 dated 14

January 2013 concerning production of documents.

On 10 April 2013, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the parties
by telephone conference to discuss certain logistical questions pertaining to the hearing on

jurisdiction and the merits.

The hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held in Istanbul from 15 April to 17 April
2013. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal,

present at the hearing were:

Attending on behalf of the Claimants:

Mr David Minnotte;

Mr Robert Lewis;

Mr Joseph M. Matthews, Colson Hicks Eidson, P.A.;
Mr David Baron, Greenberg Traurig LLP;

Mr Pawel Tatarczak, Greenberg Traurig LLP;

Mr Antoni Libiszowski, Greenberg Traurig LLP; and
Mr Zygmunt Niziot, PFL.

Attending on behalf of the Respondent:

Mr Maciej Jamka, K&L Gates Jamka Sp.K.;

Dr Wojciech Sadowski, K&L Gates Jamka Sp.K.; and

Ms Anna Leszezynska, K&L Gates Jamka Sp.K.

In the course of the hearing, Mr Robert Lewis, Mr David Minnotte, and Mr Zygmut Niziot

provided oral witness testimony on behalf of the Claimants.

Following the hearing, the parties filed a joint proposed list of points for determination by
the Tribunal on 28 May 2013 (the “List”, which is attached to this Award as Annex B).
The parties further filed an agreed chronology of events and their submissions on costs on

10 June 2013.

The Tribunal declared the proceedings closed on 22 April 2014. The Tribunal deliberated

in person and by correspondence.

SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FACTS

This section summarizes the factual background of this arbitration in so far as it is

necessary to understand the matters raised in this proceeding.

The summary is intended to provide a general overview of the issues in dispute between
the parties, and is based on the agreed chronology of events filed by the parties in June
2013. It further takes into account the narratives proposed by each party for this section.
The summary does not purport to be an exhaustive description of all facts considered
relevant by the Tribunal for its decision: these will be addressed as necessary in the context
of the Tribunal’s analysis of the issues in dispute, taking into account all of the written
pleadings in this case and the evidence given by witnesses in the course of oral testimony

during the hearing held in April 2013.

A. Blood Plasma Fractionation - General Background

28.

29.

30.

Blood plasma is a liquid component of blood. Blood plasma contains a variety of proteins,
including albumin, immunoglobulin, and other proteins known as Factor VIII and Factor
IX complexes.’ Plasma fractionation involves the separation and clearing of these proteins

for pharmaceutical purposes and for the production of blood derivative preparations.’

Blood-derivative medicinal products obtained from the fractionation of plasma, including (i)
albumin, (ii) immunoglobulin, (iii) Factor VIII, and (iv) Factor IX are essential for treatment
of many diseases, including haemophilia, deficiencies of immunological systems, multiple
sclerosis, as well as many forms of cancer. Supply of hospitals and other state-run
healthcare establishments with these products is a mandatory element of a health policy of
modern states. Governments also provide for reserves of such products to be stored and

available in case of necessity.*

Manufacturing and marketing of blood plasma derivative products has been regulated both

in Poland and in the European Economic Community (the “European Union”). Council

32.

33.

Directive 89/381/EEC of 14 June 1989 extended the requirements applicable to marketing
of medicinal products to products derived from human blood. Furthermore, the
abovementioned Directive mandated the Member States to adopt supplementary, specific

measures necessary to protect public health by avoiding viral contamination.*

Manufacturing and use of blood plasma derivative products is exposed to a number of
unique risks. These include risks relating to (i) the supply of raw material (in most
countries, including Poland, blood donations are only permitted if made voluntarily and
without any remuneration being paid to the donor), (ii) possible viral contamination of the
entire pool of plasma, and (iii) adverse reactions of patients to blood-plasma derivative

products.°®

Self-sufficiency in plasma derivative products has been recommended by the World

Health Organization (“WHO”), the European Union and the Council of Europe.’

Self-sufficiency in blood-plasma derivative products means that the haemotherapy needs of
a given country are satisfied using blood (and its derivatives) obtained from the population
of that particular country. Such self-sufficiency was, at the time this dispute arose,
considered to be beneficial for countries in order to (i) better control the risk of disease
transmission, (ii) utilize blood-derivative products sensibly, and (iii) establish domestic

reserves of blood and blood-derivatives independent of global price fluctuations.*

B. Blood Plasma Fractionation — Status quo ante in Poland

34.

It is undisputed that at the time the present dispute arose, there was no industrial facility in
Poland which was capable of satisfying the country’s demand for blood-plasma derivative
products. During the relevant period, the Republic of Poland attempted to satisfy the needs
for blood-plasma derivative products by entering into agreements with fractionation
providers located outside of its territory. Between 1993 and 2005, Poland used the

fractionation services of the Central Laboratory of Plasma Fractionation (“ZLB”) of the
Swiss Red Cross in Bern, Switzerland.’ ZLB’s services were provided on the basis of an
agreement signed on 26 March 1993, which was for an initial term of 3 years and was

renewed in each subsequent year. °

The responsibility for assuring the supply of blood plasma and products in Poland was
vested in the Institute of Haematology, which performed this responsibility by collecting
blood plasma donated by Polish citizens in Poland, then shipping it to Switzerland, where
ZLB fractionated the plasma into blood derivative products, which then were intended for
resale to Poland.'' According to the Claimants, Poland did not purchase all blood-
derivative products derived from the blood plasma it supplied to ZLB,” and therefore did
not obtain any benefit from its production and sale. The Claimants estimate that Poland
may have left with ZLB immunoglobulin products derived from Polish plasma valued at

app. US$108,000,000 to US$200,000,000 per year.'*

An early attempt to construct a blood plasma fractionation plant in Poland was
contemplated but abandoned in the early 1990s.'* In 1994, the idea of constructing such a
plant in Poland was revisited. According to the Respondent, the Polish government
considered it more cost effective to build and operate a private plasma fractionation facility
in Poland, which was also viewed as a measure to stabilize the availability of blood plasma

products for the Polish health system. '*

C. Poland’s Blood Fractionation Program and the Selection of Nedepol

37.

On 4 August 1994 a committee (the “First Committee”) was set up by the Minister of

Health in order to develop a national program aimed at establishing a modern base for

blood fractionation. '® The First Committee comprised representatives from the Ministry of
Health, the Institute of Haematology, the Polish Red Cross and the Postgraduate Medical

Education Centre."”

The First Committee also carried out a tender to select an entity which was to build and
operate a plasma fractionation plant in Poland. The First Committee evaluated bids made
by the following companies: i) Medicplast; ii) Miles Inc.; iii) TERPOL S.A; iv)
Octapharma/Cevit and v) NEDEPOL Sp. z 0.0 (“Nedepol”). Nedepol was a company

incorporated in Poland and owned by Mr Zygmunt Niziol. ‘8

The results of the tender are reflected in the Committee’s report of 12 April 1995 (the
“First Committee Report”)."” This Report noted that Behringwerke AG, Miles Inc. and
Octapharma had adequate technology and financial resources to build and operate a plasma

fractionation plant in Poland in a self-reliant manner.””
With regard to Nedepol, the First Committee Report concluded:

NEDEPOL, although lacking its own technologies and experience,
claims to be capable of constructing a processing plant based on its
own capital, a credit line from Kredyt-Bank and technologies of
KABI, BAXTER and NOVO NORDISK. NEDEPOL claims to be
going [based on an oral declaration] to construct a plasma
processing plant in Omsk.”

The First Committee Report recommended that an additional round of interviews with the

participants of the first tender was needed, and that this task was to be entrusted to an ad hoc

intra-ministerial committee be established to for that purpose.”

In 1995, the Inter-Ministerial Committee was established (the “Second Committee”),

which was entrusted with the additional round of interviews.*> In December 1995, the

Second Committee issued its final report (the “Second Committee Report”), which

contained the following statements:

The analysis of tenders was conducted with consideration of the
following criteria:

A — the construction should be entrusted to a counterparty being in
possession of modern technology, without prejudice to viral
inactivation methods in processed plasma, as well as experience in
this field,

 

B — the construction should not take long and the modular
production line should allow the enhancement of plasma
processing proportionately to the amount of material obtained,

C — due to the risk, the State Treasury funds should neither be
involved in the construction nor should Government loan
guarantees be granted. The funds should come from foreign or
Polish private investors,

D - the selected counterparty should ensure a sufficient amount of
factor VIII whose yield per litre of FFP [i.,e. Fresh Frozen
Plasma] is contingent upon technological procedures applied at
the lowest possible prices,

E — the agreement should guarantee that the counterparty will
comply with the policy of blood donation and blood transfusion in
Poland.

The Second Committee Report then reviewed the proposals by three companies, which had
confirmed their interest in the second round of the procurement process. These companies
were Miles Inc., Nedepol and Terpol.™ The key parameters of each of the bids submitted

were summarized by the Second Committee as follows:**

 

3 Members of this Committee were the Assistant Director of the Government Cabinet Agency’s Public
Administration Department, the Director of the Community Medicine Program at the Postgraduate Medical
Education Centre, the Assistant Director of the Economic Department at the Ministry for International
Economic Cooperation, an employee of the Economic Sector Department of the Ministry of Industry and
Commerce, the Director of the Department of Medical Technology and Investment at the Ministry of Health
and Public Welfare, and an employee of the Department of Medical Technology and Investment at the

With regard to Nedepol, the Second Committee’s Report contained the following

information:

NEDEPOL Sp. z 0.0 in Warsaw was represented by its co-owner
and Chairman Zygmunt Niziol, MSc. The company has been
operating for 6 years. It deals in technology lines for infusion
liquids manufacturing, according to Fresenius (Spencer Company,
the Netherlands). NEDEPOL intended to build a turn-key plasma
processing plant in Omsk in line with the modern technologies of
BAXTER (USA), KABI (SWEDEN) and NOVO NORDISK
(Denmark). These technologies would be applied in Poland. The
investment in Poland would encompass a target processing module
of 150 000 litres of FFP together with licences and transport.

The investment would be financed by shareholders of NEDEPOL
and ZAM HOLDING Companies from Poland. Kredyt Bank S.A.
confirmed its readiness for loan financing. The investment would
start within 3 months following its confirmation and it would last
for 12-15 months. Starting production after 15 months, with output
at a level of 50% and its regular increase within the subsequent 4-6
months, all aimed at achieving an optimal processing result in the
amount of 150 000 L of FFP per year. The investment
implementation is in conformity with ISO standards, and the
technology line will have a requisite certificate.

The Company suggests cooperation with the Institute of
Hematology and Blood Transfusion and the Polish Red Cross.

registered in the Netherlands. The company participated in
financing and construction of a similar facility in Omsk. [...]

IMAR Sp. z 0.0. is a Polish company, which initiated the
construction of Omsk facility. It is the owner of real property and
co-owner and constructor of the plant producing glass fiber
reinforced tanks and pipes, i.e. Nordcap Plastik Sp. z 0.0. [...]

At the same time we wish to underline that we will use licenses of
the following companies in the project:

Factor VIII: NOVO NOROOISK

Factor IX: CRTS LILLE

Viral inactivation: NYBC [...]

Construction period of the project will be 12 — 15 months from the
beginning of financing. The production will commence after the
lapse of 15 months with the output of 50% which will be
systematically increase within the next 4 to 6 months in order to

achieve maximum capacity of 100%, i.e. 150,000 liters of FFP per
year. [...]

We focus on this issue because during the recent interview on

January 24, 1995 in the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare one

of the question (32) was as follows: Is the company aware of the

fact that it cannot have exclusivity for collection of FFP in Poland?

This kind of thinking simply scares us.””
The Second Committee recommended Nedepol as the preferred entity to build and operate
a plasma fractionation facility in Poland. The Second Committee Report was subsequently
approved by the Ministry of Health.” Nedepol was notified accordingly by the Ministry by

letter of 28 December 1995.”°

D. Establishment of LFO and the 1996 Bank Loan Application

47.

48.

As proposed by Mr Niziot during the bidding process,” Laboratorium Frakcjonowania
Osocza Sp. z 0.0. (“LFO”) was subsequently created and incorporated in December 1995
as a limited liability company under Polish law. Its initial share capital was PLN100,000
(approximately US$30,000). As evidenced by the 1996 Investors’ Agreement, the initial
shareholder in LFO was Nedepol.*!

On 10 April 1996, LFO submitted an application to Kredyt Bank, a financial institution
located in Poland, seeking a loan in the amount of US$35,974,000 to finance its operations.
In this application, LFO asserted that a Swedish company PharmaFrac AB was its main
contractor and supplier,” and that the “technical documentation” for the construction and
operation of a fractionation plant in Poland (the “LFO Project”) was “ready”. LFO further
stated that construction of the plant was to be completed by 31 December 1997, and that
production was to commence on 2 January 1998, with full production capacity to be

achieved by 30 June 1998.**

In response to LFO’s application,’ Kredyt Bank decided to approach other commercial
banks to establish a consortium.* These financial institutions insisted that LFO apply to the

State Treasury for a surety as a precondition to the loan being granted to LFO.

E. Involvement of Messrs Minnotte and Lewis in LFO and Their Visits to Poland

50.

In 1996, Zygmunt Niziot met Mr David Minnotte and Mr Robert Lewis in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.* It is not disputed that Messrs Lewis and Minnotte travelled repeatedly to
Poland in 1996, and met with several representatives of the Polish Government during their
visits, including the then Minister of Health, the late Mr Ryszard Zochowski, the then
Minister of Treasury and Industry, Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek™ and the then President of the
Republic of Poland, Mr Aleksander Kwaéniewski.* According to the Claimants, the
Minister of Health, the Minister of Treasury and Industry, and the President of Poland all
made representations to Messrs Minnotte and Lewis suggesting inter alia that (i) LFO’s
operations would receive strong support from the Government, (ii) the Government would
ensure the delivery of blood plasma products to LFO, (iii) LFO would be gaining a
monopoly with respect to the supply of blood plasma products, and (iv) the Government
would guarantee up to 60% of the required bank financing to build such blood
fractionation facility.” The Respondent however contends that the Claimants’ allegations
in this regard are neither supported by evidence nor confirmed by any subsequent measure

taken by the Polish authorities.”

F. The 1996 Investors’ Agreement

51.

52.

53.

On 16 September 1996, Zygmunt Niziol, Wtodzimierz Wapinski, Bjorn Hedberg, LFO,
Nedepol, Robert Lewis and David Minnotte signed the 1996 Investors’ Agreement.*' This
agreement contained inter alia the mutual rights and obligations of its signatories with
respect to the management and operations of LFO, and determined the participation of

each party in LFO. According to this agreement, LFO’s shareholding structure was as

 

 

 

 

 

 

follows:
Zygmunt Niziot: 49%
David Minnotte: 16.5%
Robert Lewis: 16.5%
Bjorn Hedberg: 1%
Wiodzimierz Wapinski: | 8%
Nedepol: 9%

 

 

 

 

The Investors’ Agreement further provided for financial contributions by the shareholders to
LFO in the aggregate amount of US$12,000,000* consisting of US$2,500,000 each from
Messrs Minnotte and Lewis, and US$7,000,000 from “the Niziot Group”.** The Investors’
Agreement also called for the financing of the LFO Project by way of bank loan agreements

in an amount not lower than US$35,350,000.“

The Investors’ Agreement included, as an Appendix C, a business plan for the development
and operation of a plasma protein fractionation plant. This business plan notes in its Section
1(1): “Within this project it has been assumed that the production would cover 25-30% of
domestic requirements for blood plasma products”. Appended to the business plan were a
number of financial statements. It is disputed between the parties whether these statements

provided for the supply of fresh frozen plasma to LFO before the completion of the plant.

Following the Investors’ Agreement, LFO’s shareholders adopted a resolution on 24
September 1996,*° which authorized Mr Niziot to offset a certain amount of his capital
contributions due under the Investors’ Agreement against a claim for remuneration for

services provided by Mr Niziot to a Dutch company, Spencer Holland BV.”

Based on the Investors’ Agreement, Mr Lewis and Mr Minnotte each acquired 16.5%
shares in LFO, and were appointed members of the Management Board of LFO.*
According to the Claimants, they subsequently issued the following promissory notes

evidencing loans to LFO:”

4 September 1996 US$62,500 from Mr Minnotte
4 September 1996 US$62,500 from Mr Lewis

25 September 1996 US$75,000 from Mr Minnotte
25 September 1996 US$75,000 from Mr Lewis

21 October 1996 US$1,362,500 from Mr Minnotte

21 October 1996 US$1,362,500 from Mr Lewis
The Claimants further submit that they advanced US$500,000 each on 16 December
1996.” According to the Claimants, these funds were not evidenced by promissory notes,
but were loans to LFO evidenced by wire transfer made pursuant to the Investors’
Agreement.*' However, the Claimants’ payments of 21 October 1996 and 16 December
1996 were not made directly to LFO’s bank account in Poland, but into an account located
in Guernsey and held by ZAN Trust.* ZAN Trust was a British company owned by Mr
Niziot. The Respondent contends that these two payments had no legal justification and did
not make any commercial sense. The Respondent further argues that these payments may
only be understood as the Claimants’ intention to assist Mr Niziol’s alleged fraud

concerning the amount of his actual contributions to LFO. The Claimants disagree with the
Respondent’s assertion and contend that the payments were made through the Guernsey

entity following a tax advice they had previously received.™4

Messrs Minnotte and Lewis provided a further US$650,000 each on 23 February 1998 as a

loan evidenced by a letter of credit initially drawn in favour of Kredyt Bank.*

G. Disputed Invoices and Shareholder Contributions by Mr Niziot

58.

59.

The shareholders of LFO took a number of further measures between September 1996 and
April 1997 to comply with the US$12,000,000 contribution requirement established by the
Investors’ Agreement.* The parties differ on the significance and/or purpose of the various
steps taken, and also on the amounts ultimately contributed to LFO by its shareholders.

The most significant differences relate to the payment of three invoices.

(1) Payment of Invoice No. 140396 dated 4 December 1996 issued by CSL and
NYBC

On 4 December 1996, LFO was allegedly charged with an invoice issued jointly by CSL
Limited A.C.N, Bioplasma Division (“CSL”),*’ a corporation incorporated in Australia,
and the New York Blood Centre (NYBC”),*8 in the amount of US$2,766,750 for
“prepayment of royalties” and “fixed up front fees”, and made “with reference to a recent
agreement”. The invoice was paid by LFO in full in two instalments,“ and payment was

made into a bank account located in Switzerland.”

Statement of Facts/Chronology” dated 10 June 2013, the Respondent opposed its introduction at that stage in
the proceedings. The Tribunal does not consider that the new version affects its reasoning in any way; and it
is accordingly unnecessary to rule upon its admissibility.

The Respondent alleges that this invoice was forged and was intended to: (i) defraud
LFO’s creditors by purporting to be a purchase of licence rights to technology, and (ii)
create a legal basis to transfer the invoiced amounts abroad. In support of these allegations,
the Respondent contends that the two payments were made to a Swiss bank account, which
was held, not by CSL, but by Mr Wiodzimierz Wapinski, who was himself a shareholder in
LFO and a business partner of Mr Niziol. The Respondent asserts that subsequently,
US$100,000 were transferred from the Swiss bank account to an account held by Mr
Wapinski in Poland. The remainder of the funds was then first transferred to an
intermediary bank, before being deposited in two tranches into LFO’s bank account in
Poland. These two payments were made on 16 January 1997 in the amounts of
US$1,355,000 and US$1,355,005.03 respectively, and were identified as capital
contributions from Messrs Minnotte and Lewis to LFO.“ The Respondent further submits

that the forgery of the invoice was confirmed by representatives of CSL and NYBC.

The Claimants dispute that this invoice was forged.®

Relying on testimony by Mr Niziol,
the Claimants assert that the invoice was issued by CSL, and that payments were made in
instalments due to a shortage in cash flow at LFO at the time.® The Claimants further state
that payment was made in a confidential manner upon CSL’s request.®’ The Claimants also
submit in this regard that after these payments had been made, Mr Niziot entered into a

licence agreement with CSL on 31 January 1997, and sold to CSL a transferable option to

 

 

  

°' The precise dates of the payment of these invoices was subject of much discussion during the hearing, see

December 1996 for the first payment and 19 or 20 December 1996 for the second payment.

purchase 10% of LFO’s shares for US$2,100,000. In light of this agreement Mr Niziot
hence returned the US$2,100,000 to LFO.”

(2) Payment of Invoice No. 00035/97 dated 17 February 1997 issued by Spencer
Holland B.V.
On 17 February 1997, LFO was charged with Invoice No. 00035/97, allegedly issued by
Spencer Holland B.V. for the amount of US$2,520,000. This invoice related to a 45% pre-
payment under a contract for supply of laboratory equipment.” On 5 March 1997, LFO
paid this invoice in full into the bank account of Spencer Holland B.V. at the ING Bank in

Warsaw.”

The Respondent argues that this invoice too was forged, and that the forgery had been
confirmed by representatives of Spencer Holland B.V., who stated that they never
delivered any equipment to LFO, nor had they received any payment from LFO.” In this
regard, the Respondent asserts that Mr Niziot was authorized by Spencer Holland B.V. to
manage the company’s bank account in Warsaw.” According to the Respondent, the
amount of US$2,000,000 was transferred on 11 March 1997 from Spencer Holland B.V.’s
account to one of Mr Niziol’s personal bank accounts located in the Netherlands. Two
days later, on 13 March 1997, Mr Niziot then initiated a wire transfer in the amount of
US$2,000,000 from his Netherlands account to LFO’s account in Poland. In the
Respondent’s view, Mr Niziot abused his power to manage Spencer Holland B.V.’s bank

account, and further presented the payment to LFO as his own financial contribution.”

from 1990 to 1993, where he met Mr. Eduard Krapels, the Director of Spencer Holland. Then, Mr. Niziot
founded Nedepol, which was initially owned by Mr. Krapels and Mr. Niziol’s wife. Nedepol was the

(3) Payment of Invoice No. 140821, issued by E. Krapels Holding and CSL, dated 13
May 1997

On 5 May 1997, LFO was charged with Invoice No. 140821, issued by E. Krapels Holding

for the amount of US$1,065,000.” The invoice indicated that it was issued in relation to a

pre-payment for supply of certain gels and filters to be delivered to LFO.

The Respondent alleges that after this invoice had been paid in full to Krapels Holding on
17 May 1997, Mr Niziot instructed Krapels Holding on 20 May 1997 to (i) return
US$1,005,000 to a personal bank account held by Mr Niziol, and (ii) transfer US$60,000
to CSL in Australia.” The Respondent further alleges that Mr Niziol transferred on 22 May
1997 US$1,000,000 from his private account to LFO, presenting this sum as his own

contribution to LFO.”

(4) Other Disputed Transactions

The Respondent further contends that over the period giving rise to this dispute, LFO
diverted or misspent substantial financial resources, including funds paid for fictitious
suppliers of technology, equipment, and services, or under sham property lease

agreements.” The Claimants dispute these allegations.

H. The State Treasury Surety and the 1996 Bank Loan Agreement

67.

68.

As indicated above, the consortium of banks which contemplated the conclusion of a Bank
Loan Agreement with LFO requested that LFO obtain a State Treasury surety for the loan

in question.*’ LFO applied for such surety to the State Treasury on 27 January 1997.*!

On 4 March 1997, LFO entered into a Bank Loan Agreement with a consortium consisting

of five private banks. Under this agreement, LFO received a loan for an amount

equivalent to US$34,651,000.** The release of the funds to LFO was however conditioned

upon the granting of a surety by the State Treasury of Poland.

On 27 May 1997, the Polish Council of Ministers adopted Resolution No. 39/97 approving
the granting of a surety to LFO, and authorized the Minister of Finance to sign the relevant
agreements with LFO.™ The Resolution approved a surety in the amount of up to 60% of
the sum due under the Bank Loan Agreement, and also covered up to 60% of the interest.

The State Treasury’s liability was capped at US$25,900,824.

The Respondent submits that the Government’s decision to approve these guarantees was
based on the information provided by LFO in the course of the application process.
According to the Respondent, LFO had not informed the Ministry about a recent change in
technological partners from Pharmacia, Novo Nordisc, NYBC and Lille Blood Centre, to
CSL. The Respondent hence argues that the information provided by LFO during the

application process was incorrect and misleading.*

On 1 July 1997, two surety agreements were signed. One agreement was concluded
between LFO and the Minister of Finance acting on behalf of State Treasury (the “LFO
Surety Agreement”),*° and the second surety agreement was concluded between the
Minister of Finance and the consortium of financial institutions which had agreed to

provide a loan to LFO (the “Consortium Surety Agreement”).*”

 

® Exhibit C-12.

8) The Bank Loan Agreement was subsequently amended 10 times by way of further Annexes, concluded
during the years 1997 to 2001. One of the collaterals provided for in the original Bank Loan Agreement was
the registered pledge on the shares in LFO held by the LFO shareholders. All LFO shareholders signed
registered pledge agreements, intended to cover the entire share capital in LFO. The registered pledge
agreements also contained a clause that enabled the banks, which were party to the Bank Loan Agreement, to
take over the shares in LFO in the event that one of the pledgers defaulted.

A further licence agreement between

concluded a Memorandum of Understanding on 1 November 1997,” which contained
specific provisions on toll fractionation procedures.*' A further licence agreement was
signed on 1 May 1998.” The parties differ with respect to the effect of these agreements on
the position of LFO. The Claimants contend that by virtue of these agreements, LFO had
acquired enforceable rights to the technology required for the operation of its plasma
fractionation plant.’ The Respondent submits that the alleged transfer of technology from
CSL to LFO had not been proven, particularly given that in all agreements concluded with
CSL, LFO’s access to technology was dependent on several preconditions which,

according to the Respondent, had never been met.”

On 17 September 1997, the Minister of Health Ryszard Zochowski died. On 21 September
1997 parliamentary elections were held in Poland, which resulted in a change of
government: the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish People’s Party
was replaced by the Solidarity Electoral Action. The Cabinet of Prime Minister Jerzy

J. The 1997 Fractionation Agreement

74. On 1 October 1997, LFO and the Minister of Health concluded an agreement for the

this agreement shall be settled by the Arbitral Tribunal at the
National Economic Chamber Izba Gospodareza in Warsaw in
accordance with the rules of procedure of that Tribunal and on the
basis of the provisions of Polish law

Article 10 - Miscellaneous provisions

10.1 The Annexes referred to in this agreement constitute an
integral part thereof.

The parties are in disagreement as to the content of the Ministry of Health and LFO’s

rights and obligations pursuant to the 1997 Fractionation Agreement.

The Claimants assert that the 1997 Fractionation Agreement created the right for LFO to
receive supplies of fresh frozen plasma, upon LFO’s demand, even before the fractionation
plant was completed.” In this regard, the Claimants rely inter alia on the Supreme
Chamber of Control Audit Report of 2007, which described the 1997 Fractional Agreement

in the following manner:

On October 1, 1997, the Minister of Health and Public Welfare
signed an understanding with PFL, which included such items as
the obligations of PFL and the Ministry of Health and Public
Welfare with regard to the construction of the plasma fractionation
plant and the provision of plasma by public healthcare facilities
(The Covenant). [...]

In the Covenant, the Minister of Health and Public Welfare
stated that Poland needed a plasma fractionation plant and agreed
to take organizational actions in order to supply PFL with 150,000
liters of plasma per year, via public blood service facilities.
Plasma prices could not exceed world prices. [...]

The Covenant of 10/1/97 between the Minister of Health and
Public Welfare and PFL was actually an agreement establishing
the terms and conditions of business between those parties in the
area of plasma processing, made for the term of 15 years (a
blanket agreement). [...]

°° Claimants’ Reply Memorial, {37 et seq, and 93 et seq.

25

77.

Said Covenant actually constituted giving PFL exclusivity to

process a significant portion of the plasma obtained in Poland, for

a term of 15 years, and thus constituted preferential treatment of

that company on the Polish market.”
The Respondent contends that under Article 3.2. of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement, the
obligation of the Ministry of Health to supply fresh frozen plasma was conditional upon
the completion of the plant by LFO.** The Respondent submits that the lack of a provision
in the 1997 Fractionation Agreement on (i) the quantity of plasma to be supplied, (ii) the
prices any fresh frozen plasma to be supplied, and (iii) the prices for plasma-derivative
products, renders it impossible to accept the interpretation proposed by the Claimants that

the 1997 Fractionation Agreement envisioned LFO to start production immediately.”

K. The Construction of the Fractionation Plant

78.

79.

On 23 October 1996, LFO had obtained a permit to conduct commercial activities in the
Special Economic Zone “Euro-Park” in Mielec, and on 18 December 1997, LFO acquired
from the State Treasury the right of perpetual usufruct to 2ha of land located in the Special
Economic Zone in Mielec.” The Claimants contend that the Ministry of Health approved
the construction of a fractionation facility on this land, and construction of the LFO plant

began in 1998.

According to the Claimants, construction of the factory building was completed in 2000.'"'
The Respondent asserts that due to disputes between LFO and several construction
companies, construction of the plant was delayed from the beginning, and works on the
facility came to a halt in 1999.'” In the Respondent’s view, construction of the plant was

never completed.'”*

The Claimants’ Request for Supply of Frozen Plasma

During the period 1998 and 2000, LFO sent a series of letters to the Ministry of Health,
including letters dated 20 April 1998,'" 12 August 1998,' 24 August 1998,'°° 9 September
1998,'” 12 February 1999,'°* 29 June 1999,'” 26 August 1999'!° and 17 September 1999.'"'
Referencing the 1997 Fractionation Agreement, LFO requested the Ministry in these letters
to supply fresh frozen plasma to LFO and indicated that such plasma would be processed at

CSL’s facilities in Australia.

104 Exhibit C-15. “In accordance with the Agreement with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, in mid-
year 1998 we are planning to process approximately 50,000 liters of plasma at CSL on the same technological
line and using the same technological process. This will considerably speed up the registration of preparations
and the preparations will permit to make up the deficit in their supply.”

105 Exhibit C-56. “In accordance with the agreement of October Ist, 1997 concluded between the Ministry of
Health and Social Welfare and Laboratorum Frakcjonowania Osocza we plan to process in CSL
approximately 60,000 liters of human blood plasma in the period from October 1998 to May 1999. ... I
further wish to inform you that from June to the end of December 1999 we plan to process in CSL another
90,000 liters of human-blood plasma on the same terms as presented above.”

106 Exhibit C-16(A). This letter summarizes a meeting held between LFO, CSL, The Ministry of Health and a
representative of Parliament.

17 Exhibit C-16(B). In this letter, LFO indicates that it is ready to process Polish plasma in the amount of
60,000 liters in 1998 and 150,000 liters in 1999. LFO requests from the government “support in completing
the very complex registration procedures (in order to obtain the appropriate documents), just as the support
given at registration of plasma derivatives manufactured from Polish plasma by ZLB of Swiss Red Cross.”

108 Exhibit C-16(C). “On 16 September 1998 during a meeting at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare,
in accordance with the letter ref. l.dz. 201/9/98 of 9 September 1998 we declared that LFO in cooperation
with CSL guaranteed the readiness to process 150 000 liters of plasma in the year 1999. We once again
offered to deliver a corresponding quantity of Factor VIII concentrate for Immunoglobulin manufactured, in
total it would be 39 million IU. We proposed the first batch of plasma be sent for processing already in
November 1998. We are sorry to say that we have had no reply to any of our letters or proposals. The only
reply was the message on resignation of Dr M. Kornatowski, Secretary of State, from his post.”

10 Exhibit C-57. In this letter, dated 29 June 1999, LFO requested that the Ministry of Health order Regional
Blood Donation Centers to supply Polish plasma to LFO, reasoning that such instructions would be “...a
necessary document ...to continue the registration process of plasma-derived products obtained from Polish
human blood plasma.” Idem.

"0 Exhibit C-16(D). “I wish to inform you that till the present moment I have not received any reply to
several questions asked in our letters. ... In accordance with Article 3.1. of the Agreement of 1 October 1997
between the Minister of Health and Social Welfare and LFO Sp. z 0.0., in the 2nd quarter of 2000 we should
have commenced manufacture of plasma derivatives. (...) Under the Agreement the Parties were obligated to
place, by 30 June this year, written reciprocal orders of plasma and products for the subsequent accounting
year. A matter of particular importance is your consent to the acquisition by LFO of 25 000 | of fresh frozen
plasma in order to be processed at CSL Limited of Australia, our licensor. Until the commencement of
production in Mielec, acting under an agreement with CSL Limited (letter of intent dated 30 July 1999
enclosed herewith) we entrust the production of plasma derivatives to CSL Limited, a company with
documented many years’ experience in manufacture of the above products. During that period we also intend
to send plasma to CSL Limited for fractionation and manufacture of plasma derivatives.”

The parties differ as to the origin and character of these letters. The Claimants contend that
the letters were sent pursuant to LFO’s right under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement to
receive fresh frozen plasma, and that these letters remained unanswered.'* The Respondent
maintains that the issue of intermediate deliveries of fresh plasma to LFO was discussed,
but ultimately rejected in the course of the negotiations leading to the 1997 Fractionation
Agreement, and that there was no obligation by the government to supply the plasma prior
to LFO completing the plant in Poland.'"? According to the Respondent, these letters were

perceived as an attempt by LFO to change the terms of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement.

1998 Tax Inspection & the Ministry’s Subsequent Exchanges with Kredyt Bank

From 19 August 1998 to 17 December 1998 LFO was the subject of an inspection by
Polish tax authorities.''* The protocol concluding the inspection contained objections and
reservations regarding (i) the amount of the financial contributions made by LFO’s
shareholders, and (ii) the way in which funds were spent by LFO. This protocol was

delivered to LFO, and LFO subsequently filed comments in response to these findings. ''°

Following the tax inspection, the Ministry of Finance sent a further letter to Kredyt Bank

on 29 December 1998, stating:

The Guarantee Department wishes to express our concern at the
deterioration of economic and financial situation of “Laboratorium
Frakcjonowania Osocza” sp. z 0.0. At the same time, considerable
delays in the project construction may shortly lead to the
Company’s loss of credit capacity. [...]

Till the present moment, the Shareholders have failed to make the
supplementary payment in full amount, i.e. USD 12 million, to the
reserve capital declared. [...]

According to the Ministry of Finance information, considerable
expenses not related with the project activities have been
accounted as the project costs. [...]

Under § 5 of the Guarantee Agreement of 1 July 1997 concluded
between the Minister of Finance and Kredyt Bank PBI S.A., we
request any and all explanations be provided and necessary
documents presented to the fiscal control inspectors carrying their
audit of reliability of the Bank supervision over utilization of the
State-Treasury guaranteed credit given to “Laboratorium

In view of the ensuing risk to the repayment of the investment

Ministry of Finance, Guarantee Department requests the payment

suspended until the borrower has fulfilled all the obligations under

The parties dispute the character of the Ministry’s 29 December 1998 letter. While the
Claimants contend that this letter was an exercise of puissance publique,'"’ the Respondent
asserts that the letter was sent by the Ministry acting in a commercial capacity qua party to

the Surety Agreements. ''*

It is not disputed, however, that Kredyt Bank refused to accept the requests of the Ministry
of Finance. The response of Kredyt Bank of 5 February 1999!” included the following

statements:

your complete ignorance of the subject and of the documentation

To sum up, we do not share your opinion on credit repayment by

the borrower himself being at risk, since project execution does not

show any symptoms to suggest that.
The Claimants assert that in 1999, Kredyt Bank ceased to provide financing to LFO, and
decided to do so based on the Ministry’s 29 December 1998 letter.'*” The Respondent

however submits that throughout 1999, Kredyt Bank continued to provide funds to LFO.

On 4 August 2000, the Ministry of Finance sent a further letter to Kredyt Bank, expressing
additional concerns regarding LFO. In its letter, the Ministry stated “Well-grounded
suspicions that LFO utilizes the funds from the State Treasury-guaranteed credit to finance
the expenses not directly related with the project activities pose a threat to the execution of

the whole project and may have adverse consequences for Kredyt Bank S.A.”!”

Kredyt Bank responded by letter of 28 August 2000, indicating that it disagreed with the
Ministry’s assessment of the LFO Project, stating “[t]he audit results available to our Bank
at present, in our opinion do not confirm the fears and suspicions suggested in your

letter.

CSL’s Withdrawal and the 2000 Fractionation Agreement

In 1999, at the initiative of LFO, the Ministry of Health and LFO began to renegotiate the
terms of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement. CSL was to become a strategic investor in
LFO and acquire 35% of its shares. The involvement of CSL in such a manner also
required renegotiations of the Bank Loan Agreement, which was amended by Annex No. 6

dated 23 May 2000.'*

In early June 2000, CSL however acquired ZLB and withdrew from the LFO Project. The
parties differ as to the reasons why CSL withdrew from co-operation with LFO. The

Claimants argue that CSL withdrew because (i) CSL had become aware of the

government’s delays in delivering blood plasma to LFO; (ii) the Institute of Haematology
had interfered in the performance by the Ministry of Health under the 1997 Fractionation
Agreement;”* (iii) CSL had made a rational business decision to abandon more than
AUS$4,000,000 of unpaid consulting fees from LFO in favour of assuming a contract with
ZLB;'* and (iv) the Institute of Haematology “sweetened” the contract between the
Government of Poland and ZLB for the benefit of ZLB after it was acquired by CSL.'” In
turn, the Respondent asserts that the evidence supports the conclusion that CSL withdrew
from the co-operation with LFO, because: (i) CSL realized that LFO had no financial
resources to complete the project with its own resources,’ (ii) LFO had been unable to
convince the Polish Government in the negotiations leading to the 2000 Fractionation
Agreement to increase prices for blood derivative products,'” and (iii) CSL discovered the

forgery of the invoice No. 140396 mentioned above.'®”

It is not disputed between the parties that LFO knew about the withdrawal of CSL during

the negotiations leading to the 2000 Fractionation Agreement. '*!

On 14 June 2000, the 2000 Fractionation Agreement was signed between LFO and the

Ministry of Health. This agreement included inter alia the following provisions:

(i) “[LFO] holds unlimited licenses in terms of their life span to fractionate Plasma
and produce Derivatives issued by CSL A.C.N Limited with its registered office
at 189 Camp Road Broadmeadows Australia under Licensing Agreements of
January 31 1997 and May 1998 and that the rights under the licenses acquired
thereunder have not been limited for the benefit of any third party” (Art. 3.1.b);

(ii) “[LFO] offers to produce the Derivatives and provide Plasma Fractionating
abroad starting from January 1, 2001, and from July 1, 2001 the said operations
shall be gradually transferred to the Plant” (Art. 3.1.d);

The agreement further specified the selling prices for plasma-derived products until 31
December 2004 (Art. 6.3), and contained an obligation by LFO to complete its
production facilities within 36 months, i.e., by 14 June 2003. The agreement further
contemplated that fractionation production was to reach full capacity within 12 months
from the completion of the construction process (Art. 3.1.e).'”

It is undisputed that the entry into force of the 2000 Fractionation Agreement depended on

two conditions which were to be fulfilled by 31 December 2000:'*

(i) the 2000 Fractionation Agreement was to be cleared by the Ministry of Health and
the President of the Public Procurement Office; and

(iii) | LFO was obliged to present to the Ministry of Health documents to evidence
sufficient financial, organizational and technological support of LFO by an
external investor.'*

The 2000 Fractionation Agreement was subsequently cleared by the Ministry of Health and
the Public Procurement office, hence the first condition was met.'** The second condition,

requiring LFO to provide certain documentation, was not complied with.'*

With regard to the second condition, LFO undertook a number of steps to comply with this
provision. Following CSL’s withdrawal from the project, LFO first requested, and
obtained, authorization from the Ministry of Health to change the technological provider.'””
LFO subsequently entered into an agreement on 6 November 2000 with Octapharma AB,
an Austrian company, pursuant to which Octapharma AB was to provide fractionation
technology to LFO.'* It is however disputed between the parties whether this agreement

entered into force.'”

On 29 December 2000, LFO and the Ministry of Health agreed to further extend the
deadline for LFO’s delivery of the documents evidencing LFO’s sufficient financial and

organizational support until 28 February 2001.'°

By letter of 7 February 2001, the Ministry of Health reminded LFO to produce the
documentation required under the 2000 Fractionation Agreement.'' In response, on 20
February 2001, LFO informed the Ministry of Health that it had signed a “Term Sheet”
with Credit Suisse First Boston (Europe) (“Credit Suisse’), which reportedly expressed its
willingness to invest US$20,000,000 in LFO. aes Following consultations with Kredyt Bank,
the Ministry of Health decided to agree to further prolong the time-limit for LFO to

produce the required documentation until 30 April 2001.'**

On 27 April 2001, LFO requested a further 2-month extension to file the relevant
documentation, indicating that Credit Suisse had not finalized its decision to invest in

LFO." It is undisputed that the Ministry did not respond to LFO’s request.

Upon expiration of the 30 April 2001 deadline, LFO had not provided the relevant
documents to the Ministry of Health. According to the Respondent, the 2000 Fractionation
Agreement therefore automatically lost all legal effects upon the expiration of this
deadline, and the agreement was to be deemed as to never have been concluded, in
accordance with its Article 5.3. The Respondent further argues that the parties’
contractual relationships were therefore continuously governed by the 1997 Fractionation
Agreement. The Claimants were also of the view that the 1997 Fractionation Agreement

continued to be the determining legal instrument. “°

On 7 May 2001, the consortium of financial institutions party to the Bank Loan Agreement
requested LFO to repay all then outstanding sums, which amounted to app. US$7,000,000,
within 7 days, indicating that they would otherwise terminate the Bank Loan Agreement.'”

LFO did not repay the outstanding amounts within that time-frame.

On 14 May 2001, LFO filed an application with the Polish court to commence a
“composition procedure,” which is a type of insolvency proceedings.’ In its application,

LFO summarized its inability to pay the current liabilities as follows:

The reasons for the Debtors cessation in payment of the debts are
circumstances independent of the Debtor, particularly the
following:

1. the withdrawal of the strategic investor (CSL LTD in Australia)
from entering the Company, which was supposed to be associated
with a subsidy to the Company in a minimum amount of 10 million
USD and assurance of credit resources;

2. the withdrawal of the financial investor (Credit Swiss First
Boston LTD) entering the Company, which was supposed to be
associated with a subsidy to the Company in the amount of USD
20 million (the SCFB board informed us of the decision to freeze
all investments in relation to the loss of 500 million dollars on the
international financial market);

3. the need to change the production technology at the design and
construction stages, caused by the need to adapt the technology to
the Union standards, entailing a growth in the necessary
investment expenditures and the lengthening of the investment
cycle.”

102. On 16 May 2001, a meeting took place between Mr Niziol, one representative of the

consortium of the financial institutions who were party to the Bank Loan Agreement,
several representatives of the Ministry of Finance, and representatives of the Ministry of
Health. In the course of this meeting, the representatives of both, the Ministry of Health

and the representative of the consortium of financial institutions indicated their preference

of this meeting, Mr Niziot asserted that he would present such an investor by 25 May
2001.'*° However, Mr Niziot did not present an investor to the Ministry within the time-

frame.

Termination of the Bank Loan Agreement

compliance with the credit repayment schedule. On the loan termination date, the overdue
principal amounted to US$5,568,279.27, and the interest amounted to US$1,470,792.49.
The total amount to be repaid by LFO as of 31 May 2001 (including principal that was not
yet overdue) was US$22,746,309.12.'° The Polish courts later confirmed by way of a final

judgment that the Bank Loan Agreement had been properly terminated.'*

LFO’s Attempts to Engage Investors and Technology Providers

LFO continued its attempts to engage an outside investor, and on 2 July 2001, LFO signed
an investor’s agreement with Ciech S.A., a Polish state-owned chemical sector company,
which contemplated a US$12,000,000 investment by Ciech in LFO.'* It is not disputed
between the parties that this agreement never entered into force, and that Ciech did not

ultimately invest in LFO.'*

approached by LFO as a potential investor,’ informed the Ministry of Health that it did
not plan to invest in LFO.'*” The Claimants contend that while Octapharma indicated in
this letter that it did not intend to invest in LFO, the letter did not stipulate that Octapharma

was unwilling to provide fractionation technology to LFO.'*

The Claimants assert that any possible co-operation between LFO and Octapharma was
frustrated due to pressure from the Polish government, and specifically following an
intervention by the Ministry of Health.'® In this regard, the Claimants submit that a person
by the name of Mr Andrzej Kaminski, who was allegedly employed by the Ministry of
Health, misrepresented to Octapharma in early 2002 that he was an employee of LFO, in
order to (i) receive copies of correspondence exchanged between Octapharma and LFO,
and to (ii) convince Octapharma to terminate its co-operation with LFO.' The Respondent
rejects these allegations and asserts that these are not credible and not supported by
evidence.’ In this regard, the Respondent refers to an email sent by Mr Kim Bjoemstrup,
Executive Corporate Vice President of Octapharma, to the Ministry of Health on 18 March
2002, which indicates that while Octapharma had signed two licensing agreements with
LFO, neither of these agreements had entered into force and that no payments had ever

been received by Octapharma from LFO.'?
Termination of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement

By letter of 22 May 2002, the Ministry of Health informed LFO that it would terminate the
1997 Fractionation Agreement in the event that LFO did not finalize the construction of the

to LFO by the Ministry’s letter of 8 October 2002.'%°

The November 2002 Shareholders Resolution

On 26 November 2002, the shareholders of LFO adopted resolutions, '” which:

(i) decreased the share capital in LFO from PLN100,000 to PLN20,000, by way of
redemption of 80% of existing shares (in proportion to the shareholding). The
shareholding of the Claimants was thus diminished by 80%, i.e. it decreased from
33% shares to 6.6% shares in the share capital of LFO;

(ii) simultaneously increased the share capital of LFO from PLN20,000 to
PLN400,000;

(iii) increased the nominal value of individual shares from PLN100 to PLN500, each;

(iv) issued 600 new shares, constituting 75% of the new share capital, which were
offered to Mr Krzysztof Lysakowski, who was an employee of LFO; and

(v) 600 shares were given to Mr Lysakowski in consideration of a fuel tank valued at
PLN300,000 (approximately US$87,000).'*

The Respondent contends that these resolutions were not in accordance with Polish law

and adversely affected the Government and the financial institutions that were party to the

Bank Loan Agreement. The Respondent argues in essence that (i) given the redemption of

80% of LFO shares, the registered pledge that constituted a collateral under the Bank Loan

Agreement was automatically extinguished;'® (ii) the financial institutions no longer had a

adopted on the basis of advice from Polish counsel to LFO.'*

The bankruptcy of LFO was declared on 26 June 2006 by the bankruptcy court in
Tarnobrzeg.'* Subsequently, the financial institutions that were party to the Bank Loan
Agreement unsuccessfully attempted to enforce their claims under the Bank Loan
Agreement against LFO. These institutions subsequently requested payment from the State
Treasury pursuant to the Bank Loan Agreement and the Consortium Surety Agreement.'*
In 2006, Poland paid the surety for LFO to the financial institutions. The sums paid by

Poland are as follows:'”°

(i) PLN8,207,371.26 were paid to Kredyt Bank S.A. w Warszawie;
(ii) PLN12,281,819.91 were paid to Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A.;

LEGAL ANALYSIS

As stated above, the BIT on which the Claimants rely is annexed to this Award as Annex
A. At the request of the Tribunal the parties jointly prepared a list of points upon which
they wished to the Tribunal decide (the “List”). The List is attached to this Award as
Annex B. The Tribunal will follow that List as a framework for the analysis in the Award,

after some preliminary observations relating to questions of jurisdiction and admissibility.

A. Jurisdiction and Admissibility

115.

The Claimants assert that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under Article IX of the U.S.-Poland
BIT and the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. Article IX of the U.S.-Poland BIT

reads as follows:

ARTICLE IX.
Settlement of Disputes Between a Party and
an Investor of the Other Party

1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is defined as
a dispute involving (a) the interpretation or application of an
investment agreement between a Party (including any agency or
instrumentality of such Party) and a national or company of the
other Party; (b) the interpretation or application of any investment
authorization granted by a Party's foreign investment authority to
such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right
conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.
A decision of a Party which denies entry of an investment shall not
constitute an investment dispute within the meaning of this Article.

2. In the event of an investment dispute between a Party and a
national or company of the other Party, the parties to the dispute
shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultation and
negotiation, which may include the use of non-binding, third party
procedures. Each Party shall encourage its nationals and
companies to resort to local courts, especially for the resolution of
disputes relating to administrative actions. Subject to paragraph 3
of this Article, if the dispute cannot be resolved through
consultation and negotiation, the dispute shall be submitted for
settlement in accordance with previously agreed, applicable
dispute-settlement procedures. Any dispute-settlement procedures,
including those relating to expropriation, specified in the
investment agreement shall remain binding and shall be
enforceable in accordance with the terms of the investment
agreement, relevant provisions of domestic laws and applicable
international agreements regarding enforcement of arbitral awards.

3. (a) At any time after six months from the date on which the
dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to
consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement
by concilia~tion or binding arbitration to the International Centre
for the Settlement of Investment Disputes ("Centre") or to the
Additional Facility of the Centre or pursuant to the Arbitration
Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law ("UNCITRAL") or pursuant to the arbitration rules of any
arbitral institution mutually agree between the parties to the
dispute. Once the national or company concerned has so
consented, either party to the dispute may institute such proceeding
provided:

(i) The dispute has not been submitted by the national or
company for resolution in accordance with any applicable
previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; and

(ii) the national or company concerned has not brought the
dispute before the courts of justice or administrative tribunals or
agencies of competent jurisdiction of the Party that is a party to
the dispute. If the parties disagree over whether conciliation or
binding arbitration is the more appropriate procedure to be
employed, the opinion of the national or company concerned
shall prevail.

(b) Each Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment
dispute for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration:

40

(i) To the Centre, in the event that the Republic of Poland
becomes a party to the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other
States done at Washington, March 18, 1965 ("Convention") and
the Regulations and Rules of the Centre, and to the Additional
Facility of the Centre, and

(ii) to an arbitral tribunal established under the UNCITRAL
Rules, as those Rules may be modified by mutual agreement of
the parties to the dispute, the appointing authority referenced
therein to be Secretary General of the Centre.

(c) Conciliation or arbitration of disputes under (b) (i) shall be
done applying the provisions of the Convention and the
Regulations and Rules of the Centre, or of the Additional Facility
as the case may be.

(d) The place of any arbitration conducted under this Article shall
be a country which is a party to the 1958 United Nations
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
Arbitral Awards.

(e) Each Party undertakes to carry out without delay the provisions
of any award resulting from an arbitration held in accordance with
this Article. Further, each Party shall provide for the enforcement
in its territory of such arbitral awards.

4." In any proceeding involving an investment dispute, a Party
shall not assert, as defense, counterclaim, right of set-off or
otherwise, that the national or company concerned has received or
will receive, pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract,
indemnification or other compensation for all or part of its alleged
damages. However, to the extent that a Party succeeds to the rights
or claims of the national or company concerned by reason of
subrogation or assignment, the national or company concerned
shall not continue to pursue such rights and claims in its own name
unless authorized to do so on behalf of the subrogee or assignee.

5. In the event of an arbitration, for the purposes of this Article any
company legally constituted under the applicable laws and
regulations of either Party or a political subdivision thereof but
that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events
giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or
companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or

company of such other Party, in accordance with Article 25(2)(b)
of the Convention.

(1) The ‘investment’

An ‘investment’ is defined in Article I(1)(b) of the BIT as “every kind of investment, in the
territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies
of the other party.” It is also specified in Article I(1)(b) that “a company or shares of stock”

and “a claim to money” are included within the definition.

The Claimants, whose U.S. nationality is not disputed, assert that their investment took the
form of (i) equity shares in the Polish company LFO and (ii) loans to LFO, and that both
shares and loans count as ‘investments’ within the meaning of the BIT. The Respondent
asserts that the Claimants’ shares did not represent an injection of cash, because amounts
initially invested were withdrawn from the company and then returned to the company
ostensibly as additional investments, in a manner that might be described as ‘churning’ .'*
The Respondent’s allegations in this regard were directed primarily at the activities of Mr

Niziot.

For the purposes of establishing its jurisdiction it is necessary that the Tribunal be satisfied
that the Claimants made an investment in Poland. Monies paid by the Claimants to Mr
Niziot or to another third party which were intended to be invested in Poland, in LFO, but

which were not in fact so invested, are not investments by the Claimants in Poland.

It is clear, however, that the Respondent does accept that the Claimants made a substantial

investment in LFO. In its Counter-Memorial it wrote:

the contemporary documents originating from LFO demonstrate
that the Claimants contributed to LFO only USD 1,980,000 each
(totalling 3,960,000 USD) [Fn. 1998.10.20 Letter to Kredyt Bank,
Exhibit R-141]. The Claimants have not proven that they
committed any more funds to the LFO Project, except for the loan

agreement for USD 180.000, produced by the Claimants as Exhibit
c-22.'8

While the Respondent raises serious questions concerning the reality and validity of
several transactions concerning monies transferred in connection with the establishment of
LFO, those questions do not affect the fact that it is common ground that the Claimants did

make a substantial investment in LFO.

For the purposes of establishing the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the
claims, it is sufficient that there was a real investment. The precise amount of that
investment, or its value (which is a different thing), is not critical at this stage of the

analysis, without prejudice to its significance when the merits are considered.

(2) The ‘investment dispute’

Article IX(1) of the U.S.-Poland BIT defines an investment dispute so as to include “an
alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an

investment.” The claims in this case fall squarely within that definition.

Notice of the claim was given by the Claimants by letter dated 24 March 2008." In that
letter it was alleged that the Respondent had failed to treat the Claimants’ investment fairly
and equitably and without discrimination; and specific reference was made to Articles II(6)
[fair and equitable treatment], II(8)(c) and(d) [non-discrimination], III(2)(c) and (d) [non-
discrimination] and III(3). Article III(3) is the broadest of those provisions and reads as

follows:

Nationals and companies of each Party in the conduct of
commercial activities shall at all times be accorded fair and
equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and
shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by
international law. Neither Party shall in any way impair by
arbitrary and discriminatory measures the conduct of commercial

activities. Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have
entered into with regard to the conduct of commercial activities.

Those claims were developed in the Claimants’ written pleadings.

The Claimants’ letter dated 24 March 2008, requested consultation and negotiation with

the Respondent in accordance with Article IX(2) of the BIT.'*

Article IX(2) of the BIT requires that the parties should seek initially to settle an
investment dispute by consultation and negotiation. Article [X(3) provides that the
national or company — i.e., the investor — may choose after six months from the date on
which the dispute arose to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration, provided that the
dispute has not been submitted to any applicable previously agreed dispute-settlement

procedures or to the courts or tribunals of the State Party to the dispute.

The Request for Arbitration was registered by ICSID on 14 September 2010 pursuant to
Article 4 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, there having been no settlement of
the dispute after its notification to the Respondent in the Claimants’ letter dated 24 March
2008.'*° By letter of September 7, 2010, the Claimants confirmed that they had not
submitted the claims in this case to any other tribunal or court. The formal requirements set

out in Article IX(2) of the BIT are accordingly met.

The Respondent argues, however, that the Tribunal nonetheless lacks jurisdiction because
(i) the investment was tainted by fraud, and (ii) applying the Oil Platforms test,'*’ even if
the Claimants’ factual allegations are accepted as true they would not disclose any

violation of the BIT. We address these points in turn.

44

(3) Question 1. Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute in the light of
the Respondent’s asserted defence based on allegations of fraud and deceit
related to the LFO Project.

128. The Respondent argues that the investment was from the outset tainted by fraud, deceit and

129.

130.

131.

bad faith, contrary not only to domestic Polish legislation but also to international public
order, and that the Claimants were consequently deprived of a right to protection under the
BIT and the Tribunal was accordingly deprived of jurisdiction.'** While arguing that it
would be more efficient and reasonable to deal with this as a preliminary matter, the
Respondent submitted in the alternative that if the Tribunal decided to address this point on

the merits, it should at that stage dismiss the claims in their entirety for the same reasons.

Question 1: The Tribunal’s analysis and decision

The allegations of fraud, deceit and bad faith in this case are serious,’ but they are
inextricably bound up with the merits of the case. It would not have been practical or
efficient to deal with them as a preliminary matter at the hearing, and the Tribunal did not

do so.

The practicalities of organizing and making best use of the hearing do not, however,
predetermine the content or juridical character of decisions set out in the Award. Having
heard and considered all of the evidence, the Tribunal could in principle have decided that
the correct legal analysis required it, in this Award, to treat those allegations as a matter
going to the question of its jurisdiction rather than to the merits of the claims. Again,

however, the Tribunal has decided that the allegations do not have that character.

The BIT in this case does not define an ‘investment’ in terms that explicitly require the
investment to be made in accordance with the host State’s law.'*’ Nonetheless, it is now
generally accepted that investments made on the basis of fraudulent conduct cannot benefit
from BIT protection; and this is a principle that is independent of the effect of any express

requirement in a BIT that the investment be made in accordance with the host State’s

1 U.S.-Poland BIT Article 1(1)(b). In contrast, there is a reference to permission and treatment “in
accordance with [the host State’s] relevant laws and regulations” in Article II(1) of the BIT.

 

45

134.

law.'*! In previous cases, as the Abaclat Tribunal noted,’ some tribunals have treated
arguments based on fraud, etc, as going to jurisdiction or admissibility, '** while others have

treated them as arguments going to the merits. '*

There may be circumstances where fraud is so manifest, and so closely connected to facts
(such as the making of an investment) which form the basis of a tribunal’s jurisdiction as to
warrant a dismissal of claims in limine for want of jurisdiction. This situation is, however,

likely to be exceptional; and it is not the situation in the present case.

The Tribunal, having heard the evidence and the points adduced by both parties in relation
to the allegations of fraud, deceit and bad faith, has decided that the circumstances in
which that investment were made are far from displaying such manifest fraud or other
defects as to warrant the conclusion that the Claimants must be denied the benefit of the
dispute settlement procedure under the BIT, and so denied any further consideration of the

merits of their claims.

In this case it is not alleged that there was any manifest violation of Polish law, or that the
Claimants, Mr Minnotte and Mr Lewis, themselves had actual knowledge of the facts that
are alleged to prove that there was fraudulent conduct in the initial making and conduct of
the investment. The serious allegations made by the Respondent are primarily directed at

Mr Niziot.

August 2006 (“Inceysa”), {| 230-244, where the Tribunal appears to treat fraud as a matter going to
jurisdiction (because States cannot be supposed to have intended to give investments made fraudulently the
benefit of BIT protection), and to admissibility (because no claimant can benefit from his own fraud), on
grounds that are independent of the wording of the BIT. The /nceysa Tribunal also regarded claims in respect
of fraudulent investments as barred by international public policy and by the principle of unjust enrichment.

140.

The Respondent did not put forward evidence of deliberate fraud on the part of the
Claimants in the initial making and conduct of the investment,
although it did take the position that by virtue of their role in LFO they could and should
have been aware of the nature of the allegedly fraudulent transactions.'** In other words,
the Respondent’s case is in this respect based essentially upon the alleged negligence of the

Claimants.

The Tribunal also notes that the Respondent had many dealings with and related to LFO
prior to the initiation of this arbitration, without manifesting any concern that the

investment had been improperly made.

The question is thus whether this Tribunal’s jurisdiction is vitiated by reason of the alleged
negligent failure of the Claimants to investigate the factual circumstances surrounding the

making of their investment. The Tribunal considers that it is not.

While the Claimants’ conduct can certainly bear upon the question whether they can
benefit from the BIT protections as a matter of the merits of this case, the Tribunal does
not consider that the actual terms of the BIT in this case deny them access to a tribunal to

have the merits of their claims heard.

Nor does the Tribunal consider that any principle of international law, such as the principle
ex turpi causa non oritur actio (assuming, arguendo, that principle to have the status of a
tule of international law), would bar its jurisdiction in the case of the Claimants whose
connection with an alleged fraud consists in a negligent failure to make inquiries which

might (or might not) have unearthed evidence of fraud.

The Tribunal accordingly decides that the allegations of fraud, deceit and bad faith in
relation to the investment made by the Respondent in this case do not warrant the dismissal
of the claims on the basis that the claims do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.
Nor does the Tribunal consider that the grounds raised by the Respondent would warrant a
decision that the claims are inadmissible. The Tribunal will consider the allegations of

impropriety in the context of the merits of this case.

(4) Question 2. Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute under the
Oil Platforms test.

The Respondent argues that even if the Claimants’ factual allegations are assumed to be
true, the claims do not in any event disclose any violation of the U.S.-Poland BIT: i.e., the

claims fail to meet the Oil Platforms test.'"°

Question 2: The Tribunal’s analysis and decision

The Tribunal notes that the Respondent itself sets out certain propositions advanced by the

Claimants but asserts that they are easily answered or are without merit.'””

The Oil Platforms test, applied by tribunals in cases such as Impregilo v. Pakistan,'*

requires the tribunal to ask, not whether the claims do disclose violations of the treaty, but
rather whether the claims are capable of amounting to violations of the treaty on the basis
of the facts alleged by the claimant, so that the tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain those

claims.

On that basis, the Tribunal has no doubt that, whatever the force of the points that the
Respondent might make in reply, the claims in the present case are capable of disclosing
violations of the BIT. That is evident from the submissions in the Claimants’ Memorial, in
which the Claimants allege, for example, that the Respondent acted “arbitrarily and

without justification” in refusing to provide LFO with plasma.'”

The Tribunal accordingly is not deprived by the Oil Platforms test of its jurisdiction to

determine whether or not the Claimants have made out their case.

(5) Other matters relating to jurisdiction and admissibility

Two other matters relating to questions of jurisdiction and admissibility were raised during
the proceedings. Although they were resolved, it is desirable for the sake of good order that

they be recorded in this Award.

First, during the initial stages of this arbitration, the Respondent raised a question as to
whether or not Mr Robert Lewis was himself to be regarded as a party to the
proceedings.*” He had previously granted a power of attorney to Mr Minnotte authorizing
him to act as Mr Lewis’ agent for the pursuit of this claim, and had not withdrawn that

power of attorney; but both Mr Minnotte and Mr Lewis were present at the hearing.”

At the hearing, in the presence of Mr Lewis and Mr Minnotte, it was made unequivocally
clear that Mr Lewis is himself a Claimant in these proceedings, with all the rights and
202

obligations of a Party.

Mr Lewis.”

The Respondent withdrew its jurisdictional objection relating to

Second, the Respondent objected to certain specific claims made by the Claimants
concerning the conduct of criminal proceedings in Poland. The Claimants subsequently
withdrew those claims, without prejudice to the possibility of raising them in a separate
proceeding.*” The Tribunal therefore determined that those claims lay outside the scope of

the present proceedings, although the Claimants were at liberty to make an application to

amend the claims in this case so as to include them. No such application was made.*”

The Tribunal is further of the view that the other jurisdictional requirements set forth in the

ICSID Additional Facility Rules are also fulfilled in this case, namely:

a) There is a legal dispute between a national of an ICSID Contracting State and a
State party which is not an ICSID Contracting State, which arises directly out of
an investment in accordance with Article 2(a) of the Additional Facility Rules.
Messrs Minnotte and Lewis are nationals of the U.S., which is an ICSID
Contracting State, while the Republic of Poland is not an ICSID Contracting
State. As discussed above, the Tribunal is of the view that Messrs Minnotte and
Lewis have made an investment for the purposes of the BIT and hence for the
purposes of Articles 4(2) and 2(a) of the Additional Facility Rules. Further, the

parties disagree about whether the Republic of Poland complied with its

 

obligations under the BIT vis-a-vis LFO. Therefore, a legal dispute exists between

the parties which arises directly out of an investment.

b) The parties have consented in writing to ICSID Additional Facility arbitration.”
The Respondent’s advance consent is contained in Article IX of the BIT, the pre-
requisites of which are fulfilled, and the Claimants’ consent is contained in the
Request for Arbitration. Further, approval of access to the Additional Facility was

granted by the ICSID Secretary-General on September 14, 2010.

(6) Conclusion on jurisdiction and admissibility

151. The Tribunal accordingly decides that it has jurisdiction to consider the Claimants’ claims

within the scope of the present proceedings, and that those claims are admissible.

B. Merits

152. The Joint List of Points set out a series of questions, there numbered 3 — 8, which covers

the Claimant’s case. The Tribunal will answer each in turn.

°°" In accordance with Article 4(2) of the Additional Facility Rules, the parties also consented to ICSID
jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (in lieu of the Additional Facility) in the event that the
Republic of Poland would have become a Contracting State at the time when proceedings were instituted.

(1D) Question 3. Whether the Claimants’ claims should be dismissed on the merits
because of the Respondent’s defence based on allegations of fraud and deceit
related to the LFO Project?

It was noted above that the Respondent had argued that the Claimants were not entitled
to the protection of the BIT because the investment was made in circumstances tainted by

fraud and deceit.””

The Claimants did not accept that there had been any impropriety associated with the
making of the investment. Further, they suggest that if there were any impropriety it was
not their responsibility. Indeed, the Claimants submitted that the Respondent’s failure to
inform the Claimants in timely fashion of the factual basis for any such impropriety would
amount to a further failure by the Respondent to treat the Claimants and their investment

210

fairly and equitably.

Question 3: The Tribunal’s analysis and decision

There are several aspects of this case that prick the curiosity of the observer. The details
and purposes of the money transfers associated with the making of the investment are one;
the circumstances of the Polish authorities’ apparent abandonment in Switzerland of
millions of dollars’ worth of immunoglobulin derived from Polish blood collections is
another. For better or worse, this Tribunal has a limited responsibility and limited powers.
It is not an investigative body; and it has not pursued these questions any further than is

necessary for the fulfilment of its responsibilities.

As far as this Tribunal is concerned, the critical question at this stage in its analysis is not
whether any fraud or deception occurred, but rather whether, within the framework of these
proceedings, it is proved that there was fraud and / or deception of such a kind as to

disentitle the Claimants to the protection of the BIT for their investment.

161.

The Tribunal has noted in the context of its discussion of questions of jurisdiction and
admissibility that the definition of an investment in Article I.1(b) of the BIT does not
contain an express requirement that the investment be made “in accordance with the laws
[of the host State]”. It has also noted that the Respondent does not directly accuse the
Claimants themselves of deliberate fraud or deceit in the making or initial conduct of the
investment, but only of negligence.*!' The Tribunal concluded in that context that the
Respondent’s allegations of fraud and deceit were not of such a nature as to exclude the

jurisdiction of the Tribunal or to render the claims inadmissible.

Moving the analysis forward to the next step, the Tribunal now considers whether, having
decided that the Claimants’ claims are within its jurisdiction and admissible, they should
be dismissed on the merits because of the Respondent’s defence based on allegations of

fraud and deceit related to the LFO Project.

This question might be approached in two ways. It might be asked whether the investment
itself is tainted by fraud, so as to deprive it of the benefit of protection under the BIT.
Alternatively, it might be asked whether the investors are tainted by fraud, so as to

disentitle them from the benefit of protection under the BIT for their investment.

The Tribunal must apply the specific terms of the U.S.-Poland BIT. While one of the
provisions invoked by the Claimants — Article II(6) — refers to a duty to accord fair and
equitable treatment, etc, to “investments”, the other provisions invoked — Articles II(8)(c)
and (d), III(2)(c) and (d), and III(3) — refer to the treatment to be accorded to “nationals and

companies of each Party”.

Thus, for instance, it is “nationals and companies of each Party” that are protected against
treatment that is not “fair and equitable”, by Article III(3). The Tribunal does not consider
that a claimant can be altogether denied the protection of the BIT in respect of treatment
that is alleged to be unfair or inequitable by reason of the conduct of some person other
than the claimant. Such a bar would be incompatible with the very idea of fair and

equitable treatment of the claimant.

211 See above, paragraphs 134-135.

52

162.

163.

164.

Though one provision of the U.S.-Poland BIT — Article II(6) — is phrased in terms that
protect “investments” rather than “investors”, that does not materially affect the Claimants’
position, because substantially the same rights as are secured by Article II(6) for

investments are also secured for investors by Article III(3).

The Tribunal does not consider that there is any warrant in international law for denying
altogether the protection of a bilateral investment treaty such as the one applicable in the
present case, in every case where the claimant has been negligent in respect of the
detection of wrongdoing that is alleged to have accompanied the making of the investment.
It is, however, entirely possible that the conduct of a third party, or a claimant’s
negligence, may justify specific conduct of a respondent that could in other circumstances
amount to a violation of the BIT. There may be circumstances in which the deliberate
closing of eyes to evidence of serious misconduct or crime, or an unreasonable failure to
perceive such evidence, would indeed vitiate a claim; but the Tribunal does not consider
that the proven facts provide sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that such

circumstances existed in the present case.

The Tribunal accordingly decides that the particular allegations made by the Respondent of
fraud and deceit, not being allegations made against the Claimants themselves, and the
allegations of negligence made against the Claimants, are not of such a nature as entirely to
deprive the Claimants of the benefit of the protections of the U.S.-Poland BIT for their
investment in this case. It will consider in the following paragraphs whether the facts
underlying those allegations justify some or all of the conduct of the Respondent towards

the Claimants’ investment.

(2) Question 4. Whether the Respondent directly or indirectly expropriated the
Claimants’ investment (direct expropriation) or the value thereof (indirect
expropriation) in violation of the U.S.-Poland BIT by:

4.1. Alleged pressure on Kredyt Bank to cease funding LFO’s line of credit,
based on the Claimants’ allegation that this led to acceleration of the
loan repayment and Kredyt Bank’s motion to institute LFO’s
bankruptcy proceedings?

4.2. Alleged failure to supply blood plasma under the 1997 Fractionation
Agreement?

 

4.3 Alleged action by R d through the Insti of Haematology

inducing CSL to back out of the LFO Project?

The Tribunal does not find that the Respondent expropriated the Claimants’ investment,

because it finds that the facts proven in this case do not support such a claim.

a. Question 4.1.: Kredyt Bank.

The Claimants allege that the Respondent improperly brought pressure upon Kredyt Bank

to cease funding LFO’s line of credit, in order to force the failure of the LFO project.

The Respondent maintains that the communications with Kredyt Bank were motivated
solely by the desire to protect its position as guarantor, in accordance with normal

commercial practice, and to fulfil its responsibilities as the custodian of public finances.

The documentary evidence submitted as Exhibit C-17 certainly shows that the Ministry of
Finance Guarantee Department expressed “concern at the deterioration of economic and
financial situation of ‘Laboratorium Frakcjonowania Osocza’ sp. S 0.0.” and at delays that
“may shortly lead to the Company’s loss of credit capacity, and at “inadequate security of
the investment credit”.*’? That concern was, however, expressly placed in the context of
“the Guarantee Agreement of 1 July 1997 concluded between the Minister of Finance and
Kredyt Bank PBI S.A.” and the “reliability of the Bank supervision over utilization of the

State-Treasury guaranteed credit given to [LFO]”.* In other words, the Ministry was

seeking to protect its position, and fulfil its responsibilities, as a public authority that had

provided a credit guarantee for LFO.”*

Kredyt Bank replied to the Ministry’s letter of 24 December 1998 with a brusque but

*'5 That letter indicated that its author had

reasonably detailed letter dated 5 February 1999.
a low opinion of the Ministry’s ability to understand the workings of the Guarantee
Agreement, though that opinion was not substantiated by any facts. The letter was written
in memorably robust terms, which give no indication that Kredyt Bank either understood
itself to be under pressure to cut off LFO’s credit or, had it felt itself under such pressure,

that it would have done so.

On 4 August 2000 the Ministry of Finance wrote again to Kredyt Bank, drawing attention
to certain irregularities in the operations of LFO discovered in the course of an official
audit, including the issuance of allegedly forged and fictitious invoices.*"’ Kredyt Bank’s
reply, dated 28 August 2000, responded in some detail to the Ministry’s letter and
indicated that Kredyt Bank had, in the course of its monitoring of LFO, found no evidence

of such irregularities.*”’

There is no evidence that indicates that the Respondent’s dealings with Kredyt Bank were
motivated by anything other than a legitimate concern to protect its position as a guarantor
and fulfil its responsibilities as an accountable user of public funds. The Tribunal accepts
the Respondent’s explanation of its conduct in relation to the Kredyt Bank issue. The
Tribunal has relied here upon contemporaneous evidence, but it notes also the account
(which is relevant to all of the findings on the merits) given in 2002 by the Minister of
Health to the Secretary of the Committee of the Council of Ministers.”'* The Tribunal
accordingly finds that there is no evidence that the Respondent brought improper pressure

upon Kredyt Bank to cease funding LFO's line of credit.

b. Question 4.2.: Supply of Plasma.

The Tribunal has approached the question of the supply of plasma pursuant to the 1997
Fractionation Agreement bearing in mind that the LFO project involved several phases or
aspects, including (a) the testing of LFO’s processes and products, (b) the registering of
LFO’s processes and products as drugs for use in Poland, and (c) obtaining authorizations
from the Respondent to register and use its processes and sell its products to the
Respondent in Poland. These phases are distinguished as a matter of fact: the 1997
Fractionation Agreement does not itself distinguish between the supply of plasma for

different phases or purposes.

It is common ground that blood plasma was not in fact supplied under the 1997
Fractionation Agreement for the purpose of testing the fractionating process through trials
to be conducted abroad before the factory in Poland was completed. The question in the
context of this claim is whether the Respondent was under any duty to supply the plasma in

such circumstances and improperly refused to do so.

The Claimants assert that the Respondent was under a duty to supply plasma for testing
purposes on demand,”” which it did not fulfil,” and that the failure to deliver the samples
for testing caused delays which led to the failure of the project. The Respondent denies that

there was any such duty, and denies that the non-delivery caused the failure of the project.

As far as the existence of the duty is concerned, the 1997 Fractionation Agreement”!
contains no provision that addresses the question of the supply of plasma for testing
abroad, and the Tribunal finds no basis for implying such a term into the contract. Article
3.4 of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement provides that LFO (there described as ‘PFL’)
“shall carry out the registration of the products in accordance with the regulations in
force”, but says nothing about the supply of plasma for that purpose or about the schedule

according to which registration would be secured.

179.

The Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimants’ argument that an obligation to supply
plasma for testing purposes was created by Article 4.1 of the 1997 Fractionation
Agreement.” That provision required the Ministry to “ensure that the organizational
actions are taken for the supplying of plasma to PFL by organizational units of the public
blood service” in the minimum amount of 150,000 litres per year. The obligation in Article
4.1 lasted throughout the 15-year life of the Fractionation Agreement set by Article 5.1,
and is plainly a general provision guaranteeing minimum supplies for fractionation, in what
was described as “a framework agreement setting forth the cooperation between the
ministry and the company”.*” It is silent on the specific question of the supply of plasma

for testing purposes.

In the view of the Tribunal, the express terms of Article 4.1 cannot be construed as
requiring the Respondent to deliver plasma for the purposes of pre-production testing,
either on demand or by any given date. The Tribunal notes that a contractual term that
would have imposed such a duty was included in a draft of the 1997 Fractionation
Agreement but was not included in the agreed final text of the 1997 Fractionation

Agreement.”

The Respondent had monopoly control over the supply of Polish plasma” (but not over all
plasma; and non-Polish plasma could be and was used for the initial stage of the testing).””°
It is certainly arguable that the Respondent was obliged to supply Polish plasma at some
stage for testing purposes. That conclusion is at least arguably necessary in order to give
the 1997 Fractionation Agreement practical effect: at some stage LFO had to obtain Polish

plasma for testing from somewhere. But the Claimants’ case requires more than that.

The Claimants assert that the Respondent wrongfully failed to deliver the plasma when it

was demanded; but the Tribunal considers that the Claimants have not shown that there

was any legal obligation to supply the plasma on demand and have not shown that the
failure to deliver it in 1998 or 1999 was wrongful. Furthermore, the Respondent pointed to
the possibility of different scenarios for testing and registration of plasma products, which
could have avoided the need for the pre-production delivery of plasma for testing prior to

the completion of the construction of the plant.””

The Tribunal reaches this conclusion without the need to explore the question whether, if
there had been such an obligation, any failure by the Respondent to deliver supplies of

plasma might have been justified in the light of LFO’s own conduct.”*

The Tribunal has also considered whether there was an obligation that arose otherwise than
by contract: for example, through the creation by the Respondent of legitimate expectations
on which the Claimants were entitled to rely. Though Mr Niziot suggested in his testimony
that it had reasonably been assumed or understood that plasma supplies would be provided
by the Respondent on request for testing abroad, the Tribunal does not regard this as
proven or supported by the evidence before it. No evidence of the Respondent making any
specific commitment to supply plasma on demand or at any specific time for testing can be

found.

There is also a factual point to be made. As far as the alleged breach of a duty to supply the
plasma for testing is concerned, while there is evidence that LFO communicated to the
Respondent its readiness to receive plasma samples and its plans to process them, there
appears to be no documentary evidence of any clear request that the Respondent deliver

229

those samples before 1999.

Article 3.2 and Article 6.2 of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement required that requests for
the supply of plasma be made once during each (calendar) year, before June 30" of the
preceding (financial) year. There is no clear request prior to 30 June 1998. The letter dated

20 April 1998" is not a request for plasma: it is a statement — a report — of the activities of

LFO. Mr Niziot testified that he had requested plasma;*' but it is not until the year
preceding 30 June 1999 in the documentary record that actual requests (even then couched
in somewhat oblique language) are made for the delivery of the plasma to LFO for

testing.**

In these circumstances, and in particular in light of the absence of proof of any specific
legal obligation to deliver plasma for testing abroad before the completion of the plant in
Poland (let alone, to deliver it by any particular date), the Tribunal is unable to find that the
Respondent acted improperly in not delivering plasma samples for testing in Australia. It
accordingly rejects the claim that the non-delivery of plasma for testing was conduct that

could support a finding that the Claimants’ property had been expropriated.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that it is not proven that the Respondent was
acting in breach of any legal duty in not delivering plasma to LFO for testing abroad, and
that nothing in the circumstances of the non-delivery provides a basis upon which a claim
that the Respondent had expropriated the Claimants’ property, in violation of the BIT,
could be built.

c. Question 4.3.: CSL’s Withdrawal from the project.

The evidence in this case is insufficient to yield a complete explanation of the
circumstances in which, and the reasons for which, CSL withdrew from the project and, in
particular, eventually failed to supply LFO with the necessary licences. The Claimants say
that CSL was induced or pressured by the Respondent to withdraw from the arrangement
with LFO.** The Respondent denies that allegation, for which it says there is no

evidence.**

The Claimants have not pointed to any actual evidence that CSL was induced or pressured

by the Respondent to withdraw from the arrangement with LFO. They rest their case on

*! Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 17 April 2013, pp. 95-96.

inferences drawn from the fact that CSL’s withdrawal was followed by its subsequent entry

into an advantageous arrangement with ZLB and the Institute of Haematology.**

The Tribunal has concluded that there is no evidence in the record that warrants the
conclusion that CSL was induced or pressured by the Respondent to withdraw from the
arrangement with LFO. It notes that Mr Niziol’s Reply Witness Statement puts forward the
view that “CSL was just using LFO to gain access to the Polish plasma market, which
access it then exploited when it secretly acquired ZLB.” ** That suggests what counsel for
the Claimants described as the “very cold, very hard business decision” by CSL to pull out
of its arrangement with LFO.*’ Similarly, the suggestion that CSL pulled out because the

Respondent was “blowing hot and cold at the same time toward the LFO project”***

points.
to a withdrawal prompted by CSL’s commercial judgement rather than engineered by or in

collusion with the Respondent.

The Tribunal accordingly finds that the allegation that the Respondent induced or
pressured CSL to withdraw from its arrangement with LFO is not proven as a matter of

fact.

The Tribunal having found against the Claimants on the facts in relation to this part (i-e.,
the part addressed in question 4.3) of the claim, there is no basis upon which the claim that
the Respondent’s conduct constituted expropriation can be built. It is not necessary to
decide the question whether the facts as alleged by the Claimants would have amounted to

an expropriation contrary to the U.S.-Poland BIT if they had been proved.

(3) Question 5. Whether the Respondent violated its obligations to the Claimants
under the fair and equitable treatment standard of the U.S.-Poland BIT, because
of:

5.1. Alleged failures to meet legitimate expectations of the Claimants related
to their investment;

5.2. Alleged pressure on Kredyt Bank to cease funding LFO’s line of credit;

5.3. Alleged failure to supply blood plasma under the 1997 Fractionation
Agreement;

5.4 Alleged interference with CSL; and/or
5.5 Alleged interference with the Octapharma contract.

The Tribunal’s determinations in relation to Questions 1, 2 and 3, above, are applicable

also in this context.

a. Question 5.1.: Legitimate Expectations.

The Claimants rely upon representations by Government officials that the Claimants say
showed that the Polish Government was “fully supportive of LFO and its principal,
Zygmunt Niziot.”*” The Respondent says that “legitimate expectations must be created in

a specific and unambiguous manner”, and that this has not been shown by the Claimants.™”

The Tribunal must decide on the basis of the evidence before it. While there may,
arguably, be a general expectation that States will observe basic standards such as
reasonable consistency and transparency, more specific expectations must be specifically
created and proved. In the present case, the Claimants allege that there was a legitimate
expectation that the Respondent would provide blood plasma under the 1997 Fractionation
Agreement.™' As was noted above,™” however, the Claimants need to show, not merely
that there was a legitimate expectation that blood plasma would be provided, but more

precisely that there was a legitimate expectation that it would be provided on demand or at

a specific time for the purposes of testing abroad prior to the completion of the

fractionation facility in Poland.

The Claimants and LFO may have hoped or expected that this would be the case; but there
is no documentary, or specific evidential, support for that expectation. This is not merely a
question of the form in which the evidence is presented. In the present case, the specific
removal from the draft Fractionation Agreement of the explicit obligation concerning the
supply of plasma for testing purposes”? created a situation in which LFO, that is, an
international business operator, deemed to be a competent professional - should have taken
some step to obtain reassurance that the supply would be made as LFO wished. In the view
of the Tribunal, the Claimants’ inability to point to any such reassurance weighs heavily
against the claim that LFO had a legitimate expectation upon which they could rely
concerning the circumstances in which they could require the supply of plasma for testing

purposes, prior to completion of the plant.

The Tribunal has also considered whether the alleged treatment of Kredyt Bank or CSL by
the Respondent interfered with any legitimate expectations of the Claimants or LFO. For
the reasons stated in response to Question 4, the Tribunal has decided that there is no
evidence that the Respondent conducted itself improperly in its dealings with Kredyt Bank
or CSL, and accordingly finds that there is no basis for a claim that those dealings defeated

any legitimate expectations of the Claimants.

The Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have not shown that they had any legitimate

expectations that were defeated by the conduct of the Respondent.

b. Other claims in relation to 5.2.: Kredyt Bank; 5.3.: Supply of Plasma; 5.4.: CSL.

The question whether the treatment by the Respondent of Kredyt Bank, or of the supply of
plasma for testing purposes, or its alleged dealings with CSL, violated the duty of fair and
equitable treatment is distinct from (and broader than) the question whether that treatment

defeated any of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations. In each of those three contexts the

43 See above, paragraph 177.

62

198.

199.

200.

Tribunal has already found that the Respondent did not act in a manner that violated any

specific obligations by which it was bound to the Claimants and LFO.

The Claimants refer to the approach to the interpretation of the duty of fair and equitable
treatment adopted by tribunals in cases such as Waste Management, Myers, Lauder, Saluka
and TecMed.** While the precise formulations of the fair and equitable treatment standard
in these, and other, awards differ, they all have in common the notion that the State must
be shown to have acted delinquently in some way or other if it is to be held to have
violated that standard. It is not enough that a claimant should find itself in an unfortunate

position as a result of all of its dealings with a respondent.

In the present case, the Tribunal can find no evidence that the Respondent acted
unlawfully, or that it exercised its rights for an improper purpose or in an improper manner.
The Tribunal notes that there were long delays in responding to letters from LFO.** While
those delays may have been inappropriate, they are not of a nature to amount to a violation
of its obligations under the BIT. The Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have not made

out their claim that the Respondent acted in a manner that was unfair or inequitable.

c. Question 5.5.: Octapharma.

The same conclusion is true of the Respondent’s dealings with Octapharma. The Claimants
alleged that Octapharma was induced by the Institute of Haematology to cancel its
contracts with LFO.™* The Tribunal has considered the evidence carefully, but can find no
evidence of conduct towards Octapharma, attributable to the Respondent, that would

breach the fair and equitable treatment standard or any other BIT provision. In particular,

the Tribunal is unable to find evidence that Octapharma was induced by the Institute of

Haematology to cancel its contracts with LFO.

The Tribunal accordingly concludes that the Claimants have not shown any breach of the

fair and equitable treatment standard of the U.S.-Poland BIT.

The Tribunal has also considered whether the facts might evidence a violation of any other

247

U.S.-Poland BIT provision invoked by the Claimants,*” such as the provision on arbitrary

and discriminatory measures in Article III(3), and has concluded that they do not.

(4) Question 6.Whether the Respondent violated the ‘umbrella clause’ provision in
the U.S.-Poland BIT because of the alleged failure to supply blood plasma to
LFO under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement?

The last sentence of paragraph 6 of Article II of the BIT provides that “Each [State] Party
shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.” It is an
example of a so-called “umbrella clause”. The Tribunal has decided that the Claimants
have not shown that there was any legal obligation to supply the plasma on demand and
have not shown that the failure to deliver it in 1998 or 1999 was wrongful.™* It follows that
there can be no violation of the umbrella clause even if (which the Tribunal does not

decide) the umbrella clause were in principle applicable in this context.

(5) Question 7. Whether the Respondent’s allegations concerning the Claimants’
negligence with respect to the LFO project are well-founded and what relevance
the alleged negligence may have on the outcome of the case?

In light of the Tribunal’s determination that no breach of the Claimants’ rights under the
BIT has been established, there is no need to provide an answer to Question 7 in order to
decide this case. Nonetheless, the Tribunal thinks it right to state clearly that it has found

no evidence of any deliberate wrongdoing by the Claimants.

The full facts underlying this claim may never be known, but it is evident that the
Claimants relied to a remarkable degree upon their trust in their Polish associates, and in

48 See above, paragraph 179.

particular Mr Niziolt. They were unable to speak Polish, and apparently relied upon the
accounts given by others of the many papers and conversations concerning LFO that were,
naturally, in Polish. It is difficult to see how they could, by so doing, exercise any effective
oversight of the company of the kind for which their positions on the management board of
LFO made them responsible. It is unclear precisely what they understood to be the reasons
for, and effects of, transactions such as the 2002 resolutions, which dramatically altered the
position of the company’s creditors; but whatever the truth may be it cannot affect the
outcome of this case or the Tribunal’s decisions on the list of questions put to it; and the

Tribunal pursues the matter no further.

It is tempting to conclude, with hindsight, that the Claimants trusted too much, and perhaps
overestimated the extent to which their previous commercial successes demonstrated a
level of business acumen sufficient to overcome the obstacles of operating in a foreign

country, in a foreign language, and within a foreign legal and administrative system.

(6) Question 8. What is the evidentiary effect of Decision No. 117/PG/2002 of
October 2, 2002 of the Ministry of Economy that the “main reason for the delay
in completion of the investment project was the failure of the Ministry of Health
to perform the 1 October 1997 agreement on cooperation with regard to the
supply of plasma and collection of finished products health service
establishments?”*”

The Claimants submit that Decision No. 117/PG/2002 of October 2, 2002 of the Ministry

251

of Economy (the “Decision”)*' says that the reason the LFO project had not been

completed up until that time was not the fault of the principals of LFO, and that this

decision is binding on the Respondent.”

> See Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, §{] 219-227.

250 This is an evidential question which logically precedes the Tribunal’s finding on the law. But it figures in
this position in the Parties’ joint list of issues which might require determination; and it is convenient to deal
with it here.

208. That Decision related to the permit under which LFO was allowed to operate in the Special

Economic Zone ‘Euro-Park’ Mielec,** with the various tax advantages which that
entailed.** The permit had expired because the conditions set out in Clause II of the
permit, which included the commencement of economic activity at the facility by 31
December 2001, had not been met by LFO. The Decision extended the 2001 deadline until
30 June 2003.

The extension was based on the finding by the Minister of Economy that “the
circumstances which led to the entrepreneur’s failure to meet the terms of the Permit were
beyond his control.”*** LFO had “pointed out that the main reason for the delay in the
completion of the investment project was the failure of the Ministry of Health to perform
the 1 October 1997 agreement on cooperation with regard to the supply of plasma and
collection of finished products by health service establishments.” The Decision does not,
however, make any explicit determination of the proper interpretation of the contractual
obligations under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement: it rests on the finding that the delay

was beyond the control of LFO.

Moreover, the Decision records that “By its letter of September 18, 2002, the entrepreneur
added that Court proceedings aimed at reaching a settlement with the Minister of Health
are currently underway.”*° That indicates the existence of a subsisting legal dispute

concerning the 1997 Fractionation Agreement.

The Tribunal does not consider the Decision of the Minister of Economy on the extension
of the deadlines under the Special Economic Zone permit to be a decision (much less, a
reasoned decision by a competent judicial authority), whether explicit or implicit, on the
interpretation of the terms of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement. Neither can it be said to
give rise to an estoppel, for there is no evidence that the Claimants or LFO relied on the

statement in question, whether to their detriment or at all. The Tribunal has considered the
*3 Permit No. 44, Exhibit R-19.

*S Exhibit C-73.

256 Exhibit C-73. LFO’s legal advisor had also taken the position, in a letter dated 26 June 2002, that
“interpretation of these provisions [of the agreement between the parties] is subject to a dispute”: Exhibit C-

215.

Decision as a part of the factual matrix in this case, but has given it no dispositive or
authoritative weight on the question of the interpretation of Respondent’s duties arising
from the 1997 Fractionation Agreement. The Tribunal’s reasoning on the 1997 Agreement

is set out above.

(7) Question 9. On the condition that the Tribunal holds that the Respondent
violated its obligations towards the Claimants under the Treaty, what amount of
damages the Claimants are entitled to, if any?

The Tribunal has held that the Respondent did not violate its obligations towards the

Claimants under the Treaty. Question 9 does not arise.

(8) Question 10. How should the costs of the proceedings be allocated between the
parties?
Article 58 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules provides in that “[u]nless the
parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom the fees and expenses
of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges of the Secretariat and the

expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding shall be borne.”

The Tribunal does not question that the claims in this case were initiated and presented in
good faith. It does, however, note that (i) the Tribunal has found that the Claimants did not
establish any breach of the BIT by the Respondent, (ii) it was evident from the outset that a
good deal of weight was placed on inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence, and (iii)
the Respondent was put to the burden of producing a good deal of documentary evidence,
and refuting the Claimants’ arguments, in relation to allegations of wrongdoing for which

the Claimants had little or no evidence.

The cost of the arbitration, which includes, inter alia, the arbitrators’ fees, the expenses of
the Tribunal, the Secretariat’s fees and expenses and the charges for the use of the facilities

of the Centre, amount to US$573,380.12.7”

°57 This amount consists of the arbitration costs at the time of the Award (i.e., US$573,247.07), and estimated
charges of US$133.05 for the costs to be incurred in connection with the dispatch of the Award (e.g., costs
related to courier services, binding, and photocopying). The ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a

216. Pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, the Tribunal has
decided to apply the principle that costs should follow the event and that the Claimants
should bear (i) all the ICSID arbitration costs and expenses, (ii) reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by the Respondent in the preparation of its legal case, and (iii) their own
costs and expenses. The Tribunal has decided further that the costs and expenses stated in
the Respondent’s letter dated 10 June 2013 and the documents that accompanied it are
reasonable. As a consequence, the Claimants is ordered to pay (i) the Respondent’s share
of the arbitration costs, ie. one half of the total arbitration costs, amounting to
US$286,690.06, and (ii) US$931,051.23 for the Respondent’s legal fees and expenses.
Hence, the Claimants are ordered to pay to the Respondent a total amount of

US$1,217,741.29.

 

detailed Financial Statement as soon all invoices are received and the account is final. The balance remaining
in the case account will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to
ICSID.

V. OPERATIVE PART

FOR THE REASONS STATED ABOVE

217. The Tribunal decides:

(1) That the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider the Claimants’ claims within the
scope of the present proceedings, and that these claims are admissible;

(2) That the Respondent did not violate its obligations under the 1990 Treaty
between the United States of America and the Republic of Poland Concerning
Business and Economic Relations, as alleged by the Claimants;

(3) Asa q that all the Clai claims are dismissed

(4) That the Claimants should bear all the ICSID arbitration costs and expenses,

reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Respondent in the preparation of
its legal case, and their own costs and expenses; and

(5) As a consequence, that the Claimants shall pay US$1,217,741.29 to the
Respondent.

the other Party; (b) the interpretation or application of any investment authorization
granted by a Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c)
an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an
investment. A decision of a Party which denies entry if an investment shall not
constitute an investment dispute within the meaning of this Article.

2. In the event of an investment dispute between a Party and a national or company
of the other Party, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute
by consultation and negotiation, which may include the use of non-binding, third party
procedures. Each Party shall encourage its nationals and companies to resort to local
courts, especially for the resolution of disputes relating to administrative actions.
Subject to paragraph 3 of this Article, if the dispute cannot be resolved through
consultation and negotiation, the dispute shall be submitted for settlement in
accordance with previously agreed, applicable dispute-settlement procedures. Any
dispute-settlement procedures, including those relating to expropriation, specified in
the investment agreement shall remain binding and shall be enforceable in
accordance with the terms of the investment agreement, relevant provisions of
domestic laws and applicable international agreements regarding enforcement if
arbitral awards.

3. (a) At any time after six months from the date on which the dispute arose, the
national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission
of the dispute for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration to the International
Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes ("Centre") or to the Additional
Facility of the Centre or pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law ("UNCITRAL") or pursuant to the arbitration
tules of any arbitral institution mutually agree between the parties to the dispute.
Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the
dispute may institute such proceeding provided:

(i) The dispute has not been submitted by the national or company for resolution in
accordance with any applicable previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures;
and

(ii) the national or company concerned has not brought the dispute before the courts
of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of the Party
that is a party to the dispute.

If the parties disagree over whether conciliation or binding arbitration is the more
appropriate procedure to be employed, the opinion of the national or company
concerned shall prevail.

(b) Each Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute for
settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration:

(i) To the Centre, in the event that the Republic of Poland becomes a party to the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals
of Other States done at Washington, March 18, 1965 ("Convention") and the
Regulations and Rules of the Centre, and to the Additional Facility of the Centre, and

provisions of the Convention and the Regulations and Rules of the Centre, or of the
Additional Facility as the case may be.

is a party to the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.

(e) Each Party undertakes to carry out without delay the provisions of any award
resulting from an arbitration held in accordance with this Article. Further, each Party
shall provide for the enforcement in its territory of such arbitral awards.

defense, counterclaim, right of set-off or otherwise, that the national or company
concerned has received or will receive, pursuant to an insurance or guarantee
contract, indemnification or other compensation for all or part of its alleged damages.
However, to the extent that a Party succeeds to the rights or claims of the national or
company concerned by reason of subrogation or assignment, the national or
company concerned shall not continue to pursue such rights and claims in its own
name unless authorized to do so on behalf of the subrogee or assignee.

5. In the event of an arbitration, for the purposes of this Article any company legally
constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of either Party or a political
subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events
giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or companies of the other
Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other Party, in accordance
with Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention.

ARTICLE X
Consultation and Settlement of Disputes Between the Parties

1. The Parties agree to consult promptly, on the request of either Party, to resolve
any disputes in connection with this Treaty, or to discuss any matter relating to the
interpretation or application of this Treaty.

2. Any dispute between the Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this
Treaty which is not resolved within six months through consultations or other
diplomatic channels, shall be submitted, upon the request of either Party, to an
arbitral tribunal for binding decision in accordance with this Treaty and the applicable
rules of international law. In the absence of an agreement by the Parties to the
contrary, the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International
Trade Law (UNCITRAL), except to the extent modified by the Parties or by the
arbitrators, shall govern.

3. Within two months of receipt of a request, each Party shall appoint an arbitrator.

The two arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator as Chairman, who is a national of a
third State. The UNCITRAL Rules for appointing members of three member panels
shall apply mutatis mutandis to the appointment of the arbitral panel except that the
appointing authority referenced in those rules shall be the Secretary General of the
Centre.

4. Unless otherwise agreed, all submissions shall be made and all hearings shall be
completed within six months of the date of selection of the third arbitrator, and the
Tribunal shall render its decisions within two months of the date of the final
submissions or the date of the closing of the hearings, whichever is later.

5. Expenses incurred by the Chairman, the other arbitrators, and other costs of the
proceedings shall be paid for equally by the Parties. The Tribunal may, however, at
its discretion, direct that a high proportion of the costs be paid by one of the Parties.
Each Party shall bear the expense of its representation in the proceedings before the
arbitral tribunal.

[Transcript, Day 3, p.96, lines 9 to 11]

b. Admissibility objection of the Respondent against the Claimants’ claim concerning the

[Transcript, Day 1, p. 35 line 20 to p. 36, line 13, and the Respondent’s position in Transcript,
Day 3, p.96, lines 12 to 21]

B. Merits

On the condition that the Tribunal is satisfied with its jurisdiction to hear the dispute:

258 See paragraph 24 of the Award, above.

3. Whether the Claimants’ claims should be dismissed on the merits because of the Respondent’s

defense based on allegations of fraud and deceit related to the LFO Project?
[Counter-Memorial, paras. 284-291 and Rejoinder, paras. 136 to 160 and 171]

4. Whether the Respondent directly or indirectly expropriated the Claimants’ investment (direct

41. Alleged pressure on Kredyt Bank to cease funding LFO’s line of credit, based on the
Claimants’ allegation that this led to acceleration of the loan repayment and Kredyt Bank’s

motion to institute LFO’s bankruptcy proceedings?

43 Alleged action by Respondent, through the Institute of Haematology inducing CSL to
back out of the LFO Project?

LFO project are well-founded and what relevance the alleged negligence may have on the outcome of the

case?

[Counter-Memorial, para. 242 and Rejoinder, paras. 161-167 and 171]

8. What is the evidentiary effect of Decision No. 117/PG/2002 of October 2, 2002 of the Ministry of
Economy that the “main reason for the delay in completion of the investment project was the failure of
the Ministry of Health to perform the October 1, 1997 agreement on cooperation with regard to the supply
of plasma and collection of finished products health service establishments?” Exhibit C-73 Claimants
assert that this decision is binding on Respondent. It is Respondent's position that the evidentiary effect
of the Decision should be considered in light of the arbitration clause provided in Article 9.2 of the 1997

Fractionation Agreement [Exhibit C-13] and other evidence.

Additional comments to part B (Merits)

I. The Claimants’ claims for violation of the fair and equitable treatment and full security and
protection, related to the conduct of the criminal proceedings in Poland have been withdrawn by

the Claimants without prejudice to being raised in a separate proceeding.

[Transcript, Day 1, p. 35 line 20 to p. 36, line 13, and the Respondent’s position in Transcript,
Day 3, p.96, lines 12 to 21]

II. The parties also agree that the following issues could require determination by the Tribunal,
for purposes of the analysis whether the alleged violations of the Treaty, referred to in points 4-6

above, occurred:

Whether either of the following acts alleged by Claimants were an exercise of puissance publique

by Respondent:

i. Alleged pressure on Kredyt Bank to cease funding LFO’s line of credit (based on
Claimants’ allegation that there were acts of puissance publique through repeat tax audits that
Claimants allege were referred to in the Ministry of Finance letters to Kredyt Bank contained in

Exhibit C-17).

ii. Alleged failure to supply blood plasma to the LFO Project.

TL. The Claimants propose that within the analysis of the issue in para. 5.3 above, the
Tribunal should consider as sub-issues to the alleged failure to supply blood plasma under the

1997 Fractionation Agreement, the following matters:

(a) testing of LFO’s processes and products,

(b) Registering of LFO’s processes and products as drugs for use in Poland, and

(c) obtaining of authorizations from the Respondent to register and use its processes and sell

its products to the Respondent in Poland.

[Claimant’s Initial Memorial at para. 21, 52(ii); Claimant’s Counter-Memorial at paras. 99 — 102
& nn.69-70; Niziot Witness Statement at para. 30; Niziot Supplemental Witness Statement at 8-
14; Transcript Day 1, page 67, line 23-page 68, line 4; Transcript Day 2, page 90, line 2-page 92,
line 4; Transcript Cay 2, page 159, lines 9-19; Respondent’s Position at Transcript Day 3, page
87, lines 1-24.]

The Respondent’s position is that the distinction and corresponding arguments were for the first
time developed by the Claimants during the Merits Hearing and therefore they are late. It is also
the Respondent’s position that under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement there were no separate
and differentiated conditions for delivery of blood plasma for each of the purposes indicated by
the Claimants. Therefore, according to the Respondent, it would first be artificial to split the issue
in para. 5.3 into these three sub-issues. Moreover, the determination need not at all be necessary,

as the claim may fail on the lack of the puissance publique element.
Cc Remedies

On the condition that the Tribunal holds that the Respondent violated its obligations towards the

Claimants under the Treaty:
9. What amount of damages the Claimants are entitled to, if any?
D. Costs

10. How should the costs of the proceedings be allocated between the parties?
