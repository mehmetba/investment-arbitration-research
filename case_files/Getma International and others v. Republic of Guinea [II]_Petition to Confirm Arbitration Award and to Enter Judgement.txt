5. Respondent, the Republic of Guinea, is a foreign state under the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C. § 1602 et. seg. The address for Respondent is
B.P. 1005, Conakry, Republic of Guinea.

Jurisdiction and Venue
6. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to two statutory bases: first,
28 U.S.C. § 1330(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6); and second, 9 U.S.C. § 203.
7. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a) to
confirm an arbitral award against a foreign state provided that the foreign state does not have
immunity. Title 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a) states:
The district courts shall have original jurisdiction without regard to
amount in controversy of any nonjury civil action against a foreign
state as defined in section 1603(a) of this title as to any claim for
relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not
entitled to immunity either under sections 1605-1607 of this title or
under any applicable international agreement.

28 U.S.C. § 1330(a).

8. The Republic of Guinea is not entitled to immunity because this is an action under
28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6) to confirm an arbitration award under the New York Convention, a treaty
providing for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards to which the United States is a
party.

9. The Final Award is governed by the New York Convention because: (i) the
award arose from a commercial legal relationship between the parties; (ii) there was an
agreement in writing to arbitrate any dispute(s) arising from that relationship; (iii) the agreement
provided for arbitration proceedings to take place in the Ivory Coast, a signatory to the New
York Convention; and (iv) at least one of the parties is not an American citizen. See 9 U.S.C. §

202.

Case 1:14-cv-01616-RBW Document1 Filed 09/23/14 Page 4 of 12

10. The second basis for this Court’s subject matter jurisdiction is Section 203 of the
Federal Arbitration Act, which provides jurisdiction to enforce an arbitration award governed by
the New York Convention stating:

An action or proceeding falling under the Convention shall be
deemed to arise under the laws and treaties of the United States.
The district courts of the United States (including the courts
enumerated in section 460 of title 28) shall have original
jurisdiction over such an action or proceeding, regardless of the

amount in controversy.

9US.C. § 203.

11. This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Republic of Guinea pursuant to
28 U.S.C. § 1330(b), which provides that personal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as
to every claim for relief for which the district court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a)
and where service has been made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1608. Petitioner is serving the
Republic of Guinea pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1608.

12. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(4), which provides
that a civil action against a foreign state may be brought in the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia.

Facts

13. In 2008, the Republic of Guinea and Getma entered into a twenty-five-year
Concession Agreement for Getma to develop and operate the country’s main port in its capital
city Conakry.*

14. After a period of political turmoil in which the Concession Agreement was

suspended, the parties executed Amendment No. | to the Concession Agreement on November

* See Fischer Decl. {{ 7-8; Ex. 1, Final Award 4.

Case 1:14-cv-01616-RBW Document1 Filed 09/23/14 Page 5 of 12

7, 2009 that clarified certain contractual obligations, including a new schedule of payments and
work.*> Amendment No. | left unchanged the general terms and conditions of the Agreement
including the dispute resolution provision.®

The Republic of Guinea Breached the Contract

15. On March 8, 2011, in violation of the termination provisions of the Concession
Agreement, the President of the Republic of Guinea issued a decree terminating the Concession
Agreement effective immediately and without any compensation to Getma.” The justification for
the termination was Getma’s purported breach of its duties.*

16. Three days later, and before Getma had even received formal notice of the
termination, the Republic of Guinea signed a new concession agreement with a different
company, Bollore SA?

17. The Republic of Guinea violated explicit contractual obligations for terminating
the Concession Agreement by not providing advance notice of Getma’s purported breaches and
not providing contractually required compensation to Getma.°

18. Thus, in this arbitration, Getma sought damages, as a result of the Republic of

Guinea’s unlawful termination of the Concession Agreement, and a declaration that the

termination was unlawful, null and void. Total Getma-claimed damages in the arbitration from

the Republic of Guinea’s breaches exceeded € 42 million."!

19.

The Parties Agreed to Arbitrate All Disputes

The Agreement contained a dispute resolution provision providing for final

resolution of any dispute(s) by arbitration under the Rules of the Common Court of Justice and

Arbitration of Abidjan (“CCJA”) in Article 31. Article 31 states in full:

This clause will survive the termination of the agreement.

The OHADA treaty and its subsequent uniform acts apply to this
agreement.

All disputes or differences arising from this agreement or its
amendments will be settled amicably.

If no amicable settlement can be reached within 3 (three) months
following the dispute, the Parties may resort to arbitration in the
manner stipulated below:

The claim, dispute or difference will be permanently and
irrevocably settled through arbitration proceedings subject to the
Arbitration Rules of the Common Court of Justice and Arbitration
of the OHADA (“The CCJA Arbitration Rules”).

The arbitration commission will be made up of 3 (three)
arbitrators, one appointed by the Grantor, the second by the
Concessionary and the third by mutual agreement of the two
arbitrators. If a Party does not appoint an arbitrator within thirty
(30) days of receipt of a request to do so from the other Party, or if
the two arbitrators cannot agree on the selection of the third
arbitrator within thirty (30) days (of the appointment of the last
arbitrator to be appointed), the Common Court of Justice and
Arbitration will substitute for the Parties in accordance with the
CCIJA Arbitration Rules.

Each of the Parties will bear the cost of the arbitrator it appoints.
The other costs incurred for arbitration will be shared equally by
the Parties.

"' See id. 156.

Case 1:14-cv-01616-RBW Document1 Filed 09/23/14 Page 7 of 12

The arbitration will be conducted in French in Abidjan, Republic
of Céte dIvoire.

The Granting Authority expressly waives claiming any sovereign
immunity for itself and for its property in order to evade the
enforcement of an award rendered by an arbitration commission
set up in accordance with this clause.

See Ex. 2 to Fischer Decl., Concession Agreement, Article 31.

The Arbitration before the CCJA

20. Getma filed a request for arbitration (“RFA”) on May 10, 201 1.7 Getma’s
request for arbitration came only after it had made good faith attempts to get the Republic of
Guinea to comply with the Concession Agreement, including, ending letters on May 4, 2011 and
May 9, 2011.

21. The parties selected arbitrators in accordance with the dispute resolution provision
in the Concession Agreement discussed above. Getma selected Juan Antonio Cremades and the
Republic of Guinea selected Eric Teynier.'* The party arbitrators then agreed on Professor
Ibrahim Fadlallah as the Tribunal’s Chairman and, with the CCJA’s confirmation of the
appointment, the Tribunal of three distinguished arbitrators was constituted on January 25,

2012.

22. Pursuant to Rule 15 of the CCJA Rules, the first hearing took place on March 12,
2012. At this hearing, the procedure and provisional timetable for the Arbitration was decided,
memorialized in Minutes, and the Minutes were signed by the parties. '©

23. The parties had extensive briefing on the merits. On June 18, 2012, Getma filed
its Statement of Claim. The Republic of Guinea filed a Response and Counterclaim on October
18, 2012. On January 7, 2013, Getma filed its Reply brief; the Republic of Guinea filed a
Rejoinder and reply to counterclaims on March 24, 2013. Getma then filed its Response brief,
limited to the Republic of Guinea’s counterclaims, on April 22, 2014, and filed a report
concerning its damages on April 30, 2013. The parties filed simultaneous summaries on July 1,
2013.7

24. While the parties were briefing the case in 2012 and 2013, they also made
numerous filings regarding the production of documents and access to records.'*

25. After filing this CCJA Arbitration in May 2011, Getma had also filed a request
for arbitration against the Republic of Guinea on September 29, 2011 before the International
Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).!” This ICSID arbitration concerned
the loss of value of the investment going forward, caused by the termination of the Concession
Agreement, and is still ongoing and outside the scope of this enforcement action. The CCJA
Arbitration and Final Award, in contrast, concern only the contractual effects of the termination
or past damages. This ICSID arbitration was proceeding in parallel and when the ICSID arbitral
tribunal issued its award on jurisdiction on December 29, 2012, the CCJA Tribunal requested,

and the parties submitted, simultaneous comments on the ICSID Decision on January 17, 2013,
with simultaneous rejoinders on March 24, 2013.7"

26. The Tribunal held hearings for witnesses and experts from May 27-29, 2013,
closing arguments on July 8, 2013, which included procedural and merits issues, and a
supplementary hearing on December 16, 2013, granted at Respondent’s request, concerning
purported evidence of corruption involving the Concession Agreement.”!

27. In Procedural Order No. 11, from January 8, 2014, the Tribunal closed the case
and ruled that a request by the Republic of Guinea, to be provided an additional four months to
gather evidence of alleged corruption, would be decided along with the merits.”

The Final Arbitration Award

28. On April 29, 2014, the Tribunal rendered the Final Arbitration Award and on
May 26, 2014, the CCJA Secretariat served the parties the Award decision.”> The over one-
hundred-page Final Award evidences the substantive and procedural adjudication of the case by
the Tribunal. The Final Award was by unanimous decision.”>

29. The Tribunal found in favor of Getma on several of its claims for a total of

€ 38,531,127.°

30. The Tribunal also awarded Getma interest equal to the discount rate of the
European Central Bank plus one percent from May 10, 2011, the date of Getma’s Request for
Arbitration, until full payment.”

31. On July 23, 2014, Respondent filed a motion to set aside the arbitral award with

the CCJA that is baseless on its face.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
9 U.S.C. § 207

 

32. Petitioner repeats and re-alleges each and every allegation contained in
paragraphs | through 31, above, inclusive, and incorporates them herein by reference.

33. The U.S. is a contracting party to the New York Convention.

34. The New York Convention has been implemented in the U.S. by Chapter Two of
the Federal Arbitration Act.

35. The Final Award is governed by the New York Convention because it was sited in
the Ivory Coast, another contracting party to the New York Convention; involves the Republic of
Guinea, also a contracting party; and satisfies the requirements of Section 202 of the Federal
Arbitration Act. See 9 U.S.C. § 202.

36. The Federal Arbitration Act provides that the “court shall confirm the award
unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the

award specified in the said Convention.” 9 U.S.C. § 207 (emphasis added).

°7 See Fischer Decl. {{ 13; Ex. 1, Final Award, {J 269, 271, Operative Provisions at 111.

10

Case 1:14-cv-01616-RBW Document1 Filed 09/23/14 Page 11 of 12

37. None of the grounds available for refusal or deferral of recognition and
enforcement of an award specified in the New York Convention apply to the Final Award.”

38. Therefore, the Final Award should be confirmed pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 207 and
judgment in the United States should be entered for the monetary relief awarded by the Tribunal.

Second Claim for Relief

Prejudgment Interest on Amounts Due under the Final Award.

39. Petitioner repeats and re-alleges each and every allegation contained in
paragraphs | through 38, above, inclusive, and incorporates them herein by reference.

40. The Final Award includes interest at the discount rate of the European Central
Bank plus one percent from May 10, 2011, the date of Getma’s Request for Arbitration, until full
payment.

Al. Therefore, the Court should award Petitioner’s prejudgment interest on all
amounts awarded under the Final Award from the respective dates specified in the Final Award
until the entry of judgment at the rates specified in paragraph 278 of the Final Award.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests an order:

(a) confirming the Final Award, including the monetary relief granted in and
entering judgment in favor of Petitioner and against Respondent, in Euros, in accordance with
the Final Award;

(b) awarding prejudgment interest, at the discount rate of the European
Central Bank plus one percent from May 10, 2011, the date of Getma’s Request for Arbitration;

(c) awarding postjudgment interest at the statutory rate; and

(d) granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

°8 As mentioned supra at 31, the Republic of Guinea filed a motion for set aside to the CCJA on July 23, 2014. The
grounds for set aside are baseless on their face.
