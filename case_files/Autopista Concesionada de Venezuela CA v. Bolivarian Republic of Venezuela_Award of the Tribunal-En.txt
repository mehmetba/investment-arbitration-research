facts will be referred to in the Chapter entitled “Discussion” as and when
appropriate.

THE PARTIES
The Claimant

The Claimant, Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. (“Aucoven”) is a
company incorporated under the laws of Venezuela, which has its registered office
at La Florida Avenida Las Acacias Nr. 39 Sector Av. Libertador y Andrés Bello,
Caracas, Venezuela.

The Claimant is represented in this arbitration by David W. Rivkin, Donald Francis
Donovan, Steven S. Michaels and Dietmar Prager, of Debevoise & Plimpton, New
York.

The Respondent

The Respondent is the Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela (“Venezuela”). It is
represented by the Government of Venezuela, Ministry of Infrastructure (as
successor to the Ministry of Transportation and Communication), Avenida Lecuna,
Parque Central Torre Oeste, Piso 51, Caracas, Venezuela and the Attorney General
of Venezuela, Avenida Lazo Marti, Edificio Procuraduria General de la Republica,
Piso 8, Santa Monica, Caracas, Venezuela.

The Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Alexander E. Bennett, Susan
G. Lee, Angie Armer-Rios and Mara V.J. Senn, of Arnold & Porter, Washington,
D.C.

THE CARACAS-LA GUAIRA HIGHWAY SYSTEM

Caracas, Venezuela's capital city, is located on a plateau in the mountains,
approximately 17 km from the central litoral region of Venezuela on the northern
coast of the country, where the Simon Bolivar International Airport, the seaport of La
Guaira, and several recreational facilities are located.

9/113,

Caracas and the central litoral region are currently joined by the Caracas-La Guaira
Highway System. The Caracas-La Guaira Highway System is the main artery
connecting the capital of Venezuela to the seacoast, the ports and the main
international airport.

The Highway System consists of the Highway and the Old Road:

e The Highway comprises three viaducts, two tunnels and a toll station. The
Highway is a toll road.

e The Old Road is another, longer, road connecting Caracas to La Guaira. The
use of the Old Road is free.

One of the viaducts of the Highway, Viaduct Nr. 1 over the Tacagua Gorge, was
built on a fault line and was subject to earth movements and soil erosion. As a
consequence, concerns were raised as to the safety of the Viaduct Nr. 1.

THE LEGISLATIVE SCHEME

The Concession Law (Decree Law Nr. 138)

In April 1994, Venezuela enacted Decree Law Nr. 138 concerning “Concessions for
National Public Works and Public Services” (Cl. Ex. 1). The Decree Law Nr. 138 set
the framework for granting concessions of public works and services to private
companies. The purpose of this legislation was essentially to allow Venezuela to
obtain works and services without the need for government funding by seeking to
make public concessions attractive to private bidders and financial lenders.

Due to the condition of the Highway, and especially of Viaduct Nr. 1, Venezuela
decided to put to bid the improvement and maintenance of the Highway System as
the first concession project to be granted under the regime of Decree Law Nr. 138.

The Executive Decree Nr. 502
On December 28, 1994, President Caldera issued Executive Decree Nr. 502 (Cl. Ex.

2), putting the Highway System up for bid.

The main purpose of the concession was the construction of an alternate viaduct on
the Highway. The project also included the operation and maintenance of the
Highway System, as well as other construction works. The duration of the

concession was thirty years.

10/113

20.

Under the concession model, the main source of revenues for the Concessionaire
would come from the collection of tolls on the Highway during the 30-year term of
the concession. It was understood that the tolls would need to be increased in order

to finance the project and compensate the Concessionaire.

The Ministry of Transportation and Communication, which subsequently became the
Ministry of Infrastructure (the “Ministry”), was to be responsible for the “process and
supervision of the concession” (Article 12).

THE AWARD OF THE CONCESSION AND THE INCORPORATION OF
AUCOVEN

Venezuela received several bids and, in December 1995, awarded the project to the
ICA-Baninsa consortium (the “Concession’”). The criteria reviewed for the award of
the Concession included, amongst other, the base toll rate and the internal rate of

return.

Parliamentary opposition and a losing bidder, the Dayco consortium, challenged the
award of the Concession to the ICA-Baninsa consortium. On September 6, 1996,
the General Comptroller issued an opinion on the challenge by the opposition
pursuant to which there were no grounds for nullifying the award (Cl. Ex. 11). On
August 22, 1996, the Minister rejected the application by the losing bidder, holding
that the Concession had been awarded in compliance with all legal requirements
(Cl. Ex. 10 and 12).

In addition, a Deputy in the Congress initiated an administrative review proceeding
challenging the concession agreement (see below). On August 3, 1997, the Attorney
General issued a ruling, holding that the application lacked merit (Cl. Ex. 33).

On January 24, 1996, ICA and Baninsa incorporated Autopista Concesionada de
Venezuela, Acoven C.A., a Venezuelan corporation, to serve as Concessionaire (Cl.
Ex. 8). The latter's name was subsequently changed to Autopista Concesionada de
Venezuela, C.A. (Aucoven) (Cl. Ex. 29).

Aucoven and Venezuela — acting through the Ministry— negotiated over almost one
year the terms of an agreement that would govern the Concession. On December
23, 1996, the parties entered into Concession Agreement Nr. MTC-COP-001-95 (the
"Concession Agreement" or the “Agreement”; Cl. Ex. 3).

THE CONCESSION AGREEMENT

According to the Concession Agreement, Aucoven was to design, construct,
operate, exploit, conserve, and maintain the Highway System.

Aucoven’s main obligation under the Concession Agreement was the construction of
the new viaduct over the Tacagua Gorge (the “Bridge”). The construction works
were to be completed over a period of thirteen years. The total investment costs for
the Bridge alone were approximately US$ 215 million.

In addition to the Bridge, Aucoven was under the obligation to build other works
related to the Highway System, i-e., (i) two new braking ramps on the Highway; (ii)
two new trailer yards with weighing and profile monitoring stations; and (iii) a
modernized and updated set of toll booths.

Aucoven was further obligated to operate and maintain the Highway System for a
period of 30 years. The maintenance work included an overhaul of the Highway and
of the Old Road during the first two years of the Concession.

Venezuela's obligations under the Concession Agreement were mainly related to
the financing of the investments required under the Concession Agreement. These
investments were to be financed as follows: (1) mainly by loans from private banks
and multilateral lending institutions, (2) by capital provided by Aucoven, and (3) by
the revenues from the collection of tolls.

Pursuant to Clause 22 of the Agreement, Venezuela was under an obligation to
grant one or more guarantees to any potential lender to facilitate the obtention of the
loans by Aucoven upon favorable terms and conditions to every extent possible. The
guarantees to private banks were to be issued within 20 business days from
Aucoven’s request; those to multilateral lending institutions within two months from
Aucoven’s request.

The Concession Agreement granted Aucoven the exclusive right to collect tolls from
Highway users (Clause 31). The toll income would repay Aucoven’s investment, the
return on that investment and finance the operation and maintenance of the
Highway System. To accomplish these goals, Venezuela agreed to increase the
Highway tolls according to the following scheme:

12/113

28.

29.

30.

31.

e for the first two years of the Concession, a progressive increase in tolls in six
month increments according to a table set forth in Clause 31;

e for the entire duration of the Concession, an adjustment of the tolls according
to the Venezuelan Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) on a periodical base set
forth in Clause 31 and 32.

Moreover, Venezuela was to compensate Aucoven in the event that the toll
collections would not attain a minimum level (the “Minimum Guaranteed Income”
provided in Clause 23).

The Concession Agreement provided that the Concession would at all times be
maintained in financial equilibrium, referred to as economic-financial equilibrium (the
“Economic-Financial Equilibrium” or “EFE”). The EFE implied that Aucoven was able
to cover its costs and obtain fair and equitable remuneration by collecting the tolls
(Clause 44). Fair and equitable remuneration referred to an internal rate return of
15.21% on Aucoven’s investment.

To maintain the EFE, the parties established a mathematical model, the so-called
economic-financial plan (the “Economic-Financial Plan” or “EFP”), which provided a
basis for interrelating all the relevant economic and financial variables, in particular
investment expenses and income (Annex A to the Concession Agreement). The
EFP included detailed projections of such variables for the lifetime of the
Concession, including an expected investment by Aucoven set at Bs. 8.032 billion
(US$ 47 million) (Annex A1 to the Concession Agreement).

By their very nature, the economic and financial data which were part of the EFP
were likely to change over time. In the event of change, Aucoven was to update the
EFP and, on such basis, Venezuela was to restore the Economic-Financial
Equilibrium of the Concession (Clauses 44, 46, and 47).

The initial increase in toll rates, updated by the CPI, was to be implemented twenty business days after the
signature of the Agreement, namely January 22, 1997. At least forty business days before April 1, 1997,
Aucoven was required to submit an updated Economic-Financial Plan. Within the five following business
days, Venezuela was obligated to pass a resolution updating the contractually agreed toll rates, which
were fixed at a constant value as of September 30, 1995, on the basis of the Economic-Financial Plan,
thereby establishing the “initial rates” to be applied by Aucoven on the starting date of April 1, 1997
(Clause 31). The resolution, which covered the period of the next eighteen months, was to allow Aucoven
to adjust the toll rates to reflect changes in the CPI (i) every six months, and (ii) on such additional dates
on which the CPI had changed 5% or more from the last adjustment (Clause 32). The Ministry was also
obligated to publish every eighteen months a new resolution setting the maximum toll rates in accordance
with the Concession Agreement (Clause 31).

PUBLIC PROTEST AND VENEZUELA’S REFUSAL TO INCREASE THE TOLLS

According to the schedule set out in Clause 31 of the Concession Agreement, the
first increase of tolls was due on January 22, 1997. However, invoking public
resistance to the proposed toll increase, the Ministry decided not to increase the

tolls.

On February 13, 1997, Aucoven proposed a series of works which it believed would
contribute to persuade the Venezuelan public of the tangible benefits of the
Concession (Cl. Ex. 14). On March 5, 1997, Venezuela approved Aucoven's
proposal (the "Highway Improvement Agreement") (CI. Ex. 17). According to the
Highway Improvement Agreement, Aucoven would make certain improvements to
the Highway System provided in the Concession Agreement on an accelerated
basis , and perform preparatory studies that would enable Aucoven to stay close to
the initial schedule for works on the Highway System (CI. Ex. 14).

On March 24, 1997, based on an updated Economic-Financial Plan (Cl. Ex. 15), the
parties agreed on a new schedule of toll increases shifting the burden from private
cars and public transport vehicles (i.e., taxis, minibuses and buses) to heavy
transportation vehicles (Cl. Ex. 19). This shift was meant to avoid protest by the low-

income commuters.

The implementation of this new toll schedule, which took effect on March 25, 1997
(Cl. Ex. 20, Resolution Nr. 039), raised the toll rate for cars and taxis from Bs. 10 to
Bs. 200.? The rate for heavy commercial cargos was increased from Bs. 1,800 to an
amount between Bs. 7,400 and Bs. 18,300, depending on the size of the truck.

The announcement of the planned toll increases resulted in major protests from
trucking companies and officials of the State of Vargas, where much of the

commercial traffic using the Highway System originates.

As a consequence, on March 31, 1997, the Ministry requested that Aucoven refrain
from collecting any tolls until further notice. On April 1, 1997, Aucoven began

operating the Highway System, without collecting tolls.

On April 29, 1997, the Ministry issued Resolution Nr. 057 (Cl. Ex. 23), which
annulled the previous one (Resolution Nr. 039) and set different rates, i.e., Bs. 100

The toll rate for vans was increased to Bs. 300, and the toll rates for buses to Bs. 500.

for private cars and taxis, Bs. 150 for minibuses, Bs. 250 for buses, and Bs. 3,700
to 9,150 for heavy commercial cargos depending on the size of the truck. Resolution
Nr. 057 exempted certain police, military and fire department vehicles from the tolls.
On May 2, 1997, Aucoven began collecting the tolls pursuant to Resolution Nr. 057
(Cl. Ex. 25).

Despite numerous requests by Aucoven between May 14, 1997 and February 14,
2000 (Cl. Ex. 25, 42, 44, 46, 47, 52, 55, 60, 62, 71, 76, 83, 93, 94, 95, 100, 103),
Venezuela refused to adjust the tolls in accordance with Clauses 31 and 32 of the
Concession Agreement. As a result, the toll rates stayed at the level of April 30,
1997.

THE IMPOSSIBILITY TO FINANCE THE BRIDGE THROUGH TOLLS

As a consequence of the failure in raising the tolls, the funding of the construction
cost through tolls was no longer possible.

The parties attempted to restructure the contract in order to find an alternative
mechanism to finance the construction. Specifically, it appeared that Venezuela
could compensate the lack of toll revenues by a direct investment that would
decrease the amount of investment.

In June 1997, the parties started negotiations with the Inter-American Development
Bank (“IDB”). Venezuela had a standing loan facility at the IDB, under the so-called
‘VIAL Ill program’, the purpose of which was to improve Venezuela’s road
infrastructure system. IDB proposed a refinancing package, which conditioned the
disbursement of the loan upon an increase in the Highway tolls.

Following opposition by the Governor-elect of the State of Vargas, Mr. Alfredo Laya,
Venezuela decided not to sign the financing package. The negotiations ended
unsuccessfully at the end of 1998 and no alternative financing plan was proposed,
neither by Aucoven, nor by Venezuela.

VENEZUELA’S NEW GOVERNMENT AND AUCOVEN’S TERMINATION OF
THE CONCESSION AGREEMENT

In the elections held in November and December 1998, Mr. Hugo Chavez was
elected President of Venezuela and formed a new government, which took office in
February 1999.

On October 25, 1999, the newly established Ministry of Infrastructure opened
administrative proceedings to review the award of the Concession and the
Concession Agreement (Cl. Ex. 102). On July 31, 2000, the Minister of Infrastructure
found that there were “defects of nullity” both in the resolution awarding the
Concession and in the Concession Agreement (CI. Ex. 105). Accordingly, the
Ministry requested the Attorney General and the Solicitor General to take the
necessary steps before the Venezuelan Supreme Court to have the award of the
Concession and the Concession Agreement declared null and void.

On June 1, 2000, after Aucoven’s requests to settle the dispute by conciliation
pursuant to Clause 62 of the Concession Agreement had remained unanswered,
Aucoven filed its Request for Arbitration under Clause 64 of the Agreement.

By letter dated June 13, 2000, Aucoven terminated the Concession Agreement in
reliance upon Clause 60 of the Concession Agreement (Cl. Ex. 104). In the same
letter, Aucoven informed the Ministry that it was “willing to continue performing in
good faith the routine maintenance and toll collection activities described in the
Concession Agreement’. Aucoven did so “with the understanding that the execution
of such activities in good faith must not in any way affect the termination of the
aforementioned Concession Agreement”.

THE 2002 PROTEST

In August 2002, truck drivers staged renewed protests, which soon turned violent.
The truck drivers refused to pay the toll determined in April 1997.

Despite the continuous presence of the National Guard, the protestors prevented
Aucoven from collecting tolls.

On September 6, 2002, Aucoven ceased the performance of routine maintenance
and abandoned the Highway.

On June 23, 2000, the SecretaryGeneral of ICSID registered the Request for
Arbitration and notified the parties of the registration.

In Clause 64 of the Concession Agreement, the parties had agreed that the Tribunal
was to be composed of three members from the Panel of Arbitrators of the Centre,
one appointed by each party and the presiding arbitrator appointed by the two party-
appointed arbitrators.

On August 2, 2000, Aucoven appointed Prof. Karl-Heinz Béckstiegel as arbitrator.

On September 14, 2000, Venezuela sent a letter to the Secretary-General of ICSID
informing the latter that the parties had agreed to a 90-day extension for Venezuela
to name an arbitrator. On November 17, 2000, counsel for Aucoven informed the
Secretary General of ICSID that Aucoven had terminated the extension for
Venezuela to appoint an arbitrator. On December 7, 2000, Venezuela appointed Dr.

Bernardo Cremades as arbitrator.

On January 8, 2001, Prof. Béckstiegel and Dr. Cremades designated Prof. Gabrielle
Kaufmann-Kohler as President of the Tribunal.

On January 16, 2001, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID notified the parties that
all the arbitrators had accepted their appointment and therefore the Tribunal was
deemed to be constituted on that date. The Acting Secretary-General designated
Ms. Gabriela Alvarez-Avila, Counsel, ICSID, to act as Secretary of the Tribunal in
this case.

By letter dated February 14, 2001, Venezuela objected to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
On February 15, 2001, Aucoven filed Preliminary Observations further to
Venezuela's letter dated February 14, 2001.

The Arbitral Tribunal held its first session on February 19, 2001 in Paris. On this
occasion, the Tribunal and the parties adopted procedural rules and agreed on a
timetable for the arbitration proceedings. The Tribunal noted the Respondent’s
objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in the following terms:

Having considered the views of the parties and the relevant rules, the
Tribunal decided to suspend the proceedings on the merits pursuant to

17/113

Rule 41(3) of the Arbitration Rules. It was agreed that each party shall
submit its observations on objections to jurisdiction and that the Tribunal
will then decide by June 13, 2001 whether it will deal with these objections
as a preliminary question or join them to the merits of the dispute. If these
objections are joined to the merits, a telephone conference will be arranged
to discuss the following steps in the proceeding. (Minutes of the First
Session of the Tribunal)

The following procedural steps have been followed in respect of the objections to
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction:

- On April 5, 2001, Venezuela filed its Observations on jurisdiction.

- On May 7, 2001, Aucoven filed its Counter-Memorial in support of jurisdiction.
- On May 22, 2001, Venezuela filed Further Observations on jurisdiction.

- On June 6, 2001, Aucoven filed its Rejoinder in support of jurisdiction.

- On June 14, 2001, the Tribunal rendered its Procedural Order Nr. 1 regarding
the organisation of the hearing on jurisdiction.

- On June 28, 2001, the Tribunal held a hearing in Washington, D.C., on the
objections to jurisdiction. During such hearing each party presented oral
arguments and the Arbitral Tribunal asked questions from counsel. Verbatim
transcript was taken.

- Thereafter, the Arbitral Tribunal proceeded to deliberate.
On September 27, 2001, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered its Decision on Jurisdiction.
It ruled as follows:

a) The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute
submitted to it in this arbitration.

b) The arbitration costs, legal fees and other expenses in
connection with the issue of jurisdiction shall be addressed
in the Final Award.

A copy of the decision is attached as Annex 1.

The proceedings on the merits

On October 26, 2001, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order Nr. 2 giving
directions for the proceedings on the merits.

The pre-hearing written phase

On December 21, 2001, Aucoven filed a Memorial (Cl. Memorial) and
accompanying submissions, including an expert report on damages by Mr.
Suryanarayan Lakshmanan (Lakshmanan 1).

On May 31, 2002, Venezuela filed a Counter-Memorial (Ven. Counter-Memorial)
and accompanying submissions, including an expert report on damages by Prof.
René Stulz and Dr. Laura Simmons (Stulz/Simmons 1).

On August 5, 2002, Aucoven filed a Reply (Cl. Reply) and accompanying
submissions, including a supplemental expert report on damages by Mr.
Lakshmanan (Lakshmanan II).

On September 30, 2002, Venezuela filed a Rejoinder (Ven. Rejoinder) and
accompanying submissions, including a supplemental expert report on damages by

Prof. Stulz and Dr. Simmons (Stulz/Simmons II).

On October 4, 2002, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing telephone
conference with the parties' counsel. During this telephone conference, Aucoven
announced that it intended to apply to submit new evidence on issues contained in
Venezuela's Rejoinder which it allegedly had no opportunity to address earlier.

On October 9, 2001, the Tribunal rendered its Procedural Order Nr. 3 regarding the
organization of the hearing on the merits and granted the Claimant the opportunity
to file an application for supplemental direct examination of witnesses that already
submitted a statement.

On October 16, 2002, the Claimant submitted the three following applications:

- Application to submit supplemental direct testimony re: accounting and cost
of capital issues;

- Application to submit supplemental direct testimony of Ricardo Martinez Celis
and exhibits re: events since August 2, 2002 (including a supplemental
witness statement of Ricardo Martinez Celis and exhibits);

- Application to submit supplemental direct testimony of Ricardo Martinez Celis
and exhibits re: photographic evidence of Aucoven's performance (including a
supplemental witness statement of Ricardo Martinez Celis and exhibits).

72.

On October 21, 2002, the Respondent submitted an "Opposition to Claimant's three
separate applications to submit new evidence".

On October 24, 2002, the Tribunal rendered its Procedural Order Nr. 4 ruling on
these issues. After having carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments and analyzed
their respective positions, the Tribunal decided as follows:
3.1 On Aucoven’s application for supplemental evidence on
economic issues:

- The Arbitral Tribunal authorizes the parties to proceed to
direct examinations of the damage experts limited to (1)
the alleged errors in Aucoven's financial statements, and
(2) the proper measure of the cost of capital.

- Beyond this authorization, the application is dismissed.

3.2 On Aucoven’s application for supplemental direct
testimony of Mr. Martinez and exhibits on events since August, 2002:

The application is granted, subject to the qualifications set
forth in paragraph 35 above with respect to the exhibits to
Mr. Martinez’s supplemental statement:

3.3 On Aucoven’s application for supplemental direct
testimony of Mr. Martinez and exhibits in connection with
photographic evidence of Aucoven’s performance:

The application is dismissed.
3.4 On the structure of the examination of the damage experts:
- The damage experts will not be examined by topic;
- They will be heard in the order set forth in Paragraph 53
above.*

The hearing on the merits

In accordance with the Tribunal’s directions, each party filed with the Tribunal written
witness statements prior to the commencement of the oral hearing.

According to Paragraph 53 of Procedural Order Nr 4, “the Tribunal will hear:

the expert for the Claimant (Mr. Lakshmanan) : in direct examination limited to the issues of (i) the
errors in Aucoven's financial statements and (ii) the “effective cost of capital” (see # 20 above); and,
thereafter, in cross and redirect examination on all issues.

the experts for the Respondent (Dr. Simmons and Prof. Stulz) : in direct examination limited to the
issues referred to above; and, thereafter, in cross and redirect examination on all issues.

if the Claimant deems it necessary, the expert for the Claimant (Mr. Lakshmanan) : in direct
examination in rebuttal to issues arising out of the examination of the Respondent's expert.

the experts for the Respondent (Dr. Simmons and Prof. Stulz) : in direct examination in surrebuttal
to any issues arising out of the rebuttal testimony of the Claimant's expert, if any.”

The following five witnesses gave evidence on behalf of Aucoven during the oral

hearing:

Ricardo Martinez Celis, Technical Manager of Aucoven and member of its
Board of Directors.

Francisco Salas Roche, in charge of the office of The Commissioner for
Concessions at the Ministry for Transport and Communications.

Eduardo Perez Alfonzo, President of Aucoven.
Suryanarayan Lakshmanan, expert witness on damages.

Luis A. Ortiz-Alvarez, expert witness on Venezuelan law.

On behalf of Venezuela, the following seven witnesses appeared and gave evidence

during the oral hearing:

Colonel Jaime Jose Escalante Hernandez, former head of the National

Guard unit in charge of the La Guaira-Caracas Highway.

General Moisés Antonio Orozco Graterol, former Minister of
Transportation and Communications of Venezuela.

Heidi Gonzalez, former Director of Venezuela's Finance Ministry Office of
Multilateral Financing.

Prof. Gerardo Fernandez Lopez, former Vice Minister of Services in
Venezuela's Ministry of Infrastructure and currently advisor to the Ministry
on matters related to this case.

René M. Stulz, expert witness on damages.
Laura E. Simmons, expert witness on damages.

Rafael Badell Madrid, expert witness on Venezuelan law.

As scheduled, the hearing commenced on October 28, 2002 in Washington, D.C. As

mentioned above, twelve witnesses were heard and counsel for the parties

presented oral arguments. The hearing ended on November 1, 2002.

On October 31, 2002, Aucoven objected that it had been denied an opportunity to

respond to an affirmative defense related to mitigation of damages raised by

Venezuela. The Tribunal heard argument from both counsel and ruled that the

mitigation issue may be pertinent, and that the parties should have the opportunity

of putting forward the relevant evidence on this issue. Therefore, the Tribunal

21/113

2.3

77.

78.

79.

80.

81.

82.

determined that after the hearing the parties would have the possibility of presenting
applications for production of further evidence relating to damages.

The post-hearing written phase

On November 11, 2002, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order Nr. 5, in which it
confirmed and supplemented the ruling made during the hearing. Specifically, it
granted both parties a time-limit until November 15, 2002 to apply for an
authorization to produce limited additional evidence, whether documentary or
testimonial, on damages. The time-limit for replies was set on November 22, 2002.

On November 15, 2002, Aucoven filed an Application to submit supplemental
evidence on cost-of-capital issues. On November 22, 2002, Venezuela filed an
Opposition to such application.

On December 9, 2002, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order Nr. 6. It dismissed
Aucoven’s application to submit supplemental evidence on cost-of-capital issues of
November 15, 2002. The Tribunal considered that, at that stage of the proceedings,
it could not evaluate the relevance of the cost-of-capital issue. Noting that the ICSID
Arbitration Rules empower the Tribunal to call for further evidence “if it deems it
necessary at any stage of the proceeding” (Rule 34(2)(a); see also Art. 43(a) ICSID
Convention) and emphasizing its general duty to manage the arbitration in an
efficient manner, including a cost-efficient manner, the Tribunal held that the
relevance of the cost-of-capital issue would have to be decided after the Post-
Hearing Briefs and a deliberation on the merits of the case:

If the evidence which Aucoven seeks to produce turns out to be

pertinent and necessary in whole or in part, the Arbitral Tribunal may

then make use of its prerogative under Rule 34 (2) (a), order

production, and give Venezuela an opportunity to respond. If it is not

pertinent, no issue of procedural rights arises, and the chosen

course will save time and costs.
As ordered by the Tribunal, each party filed a Post-Hearing Brief on February 7,
2003 (Cl. PHB; Ven. PHB).

On March 21, 2003, each party filed a Post-Hearing Reply (Cl. PHR; Ven. PHR).

On August 1, 2003, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed pursuant to Rule
38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND RELIEF SOUGHT

AUCOVEN
Position

Aucoven’s position is summarized in this Section. It will be further referred to in the
Section entitled "Discussion" as and when a specific issue is reviewed. In its written
and oral submissions, Aucoven has advanced the following main contentions:

a. Venezuela performed none of its obligations under the Concession
Agreement. It did not raise the tolls (Clauses 31-33), issue the guarantee
(Clause 22), pay the Minimum Guaranteed Income (Clause 23), pay
Aucoven for additional and excess works (Clauses 25 and 46), exempt
Aucoven from taxes (Clauses 27-28), maintain the Economic-Financial
Equilibrium (Clauses 44-46 and Annex A), timely approve the trust
agreement (Clauses 6 and 40). Further, it failed to refrain from initiating
proceedings in Venezuela in order to annul or terminate the Concession
Agreement (Cl. PHR, §] 2).

b. | Venezuela’s non-performance cannot be excused:

. Wenezuela’s failure to raise the tolls according to Clauses 31-33 of the
Concession Agreement cannot be excused by force majeure, an
excuse that Venezuela has concocted ex post facto for the sole
purpose of this arbitration (Cl. PHR, {| 24).

|. Wenezuela’s failure to issue the guarantee within twenty business days
of Aucoven’s request, as required by Clause 22 of the Concession
Agreement, cannot be excused by the fact that Aucoven would have
assumed the risk of illegality of such guarantee (Cl. PHR, {| 49).

Nor can any of Venezuela’s other contractual breaches be excused:

e Its failure to pay the Minimum Guaranteed Income on the basis
that it did not receive an updated Economic-Financial Plan (Cl.
PHR, {| 50);

e Its failure to compensate Aucoven for additional and excess
works on the basis that it did not receive an updated
Economic-Financial Plan (Cl. PHR, {] 53);

23/113

e Its failure to exempt Aucoven from taxes on the basis that it did
not receive an updated Economic-Financial Plan;

e = Its failure to maintain the Economic-Financial Equilibrium on
the basis that it did not receive an updated Economic-Financial
Plan;

e As well as all its other failures, namely the failure to respond to
Aucoven’s request for approval of the trust agreement for over
eight months, the failure to comply with Clause 64 of the
Concession Agreement by initiating proceedings in the
Venezuelan Supreme Court, and more generally its failure to
act in good faith.

Accordingly, under Clause 60(2) of the Concession Agreement, Aucoven
was entitled to unilaterally terminate the Concession Agreement.

Clause 60(2) of the Agreement explicitly entitles Aucoven to recover its
lost profits in the event of a valid termination by Aucoven. According to a
basic principle, common to both Venezuelan and international law, the
damaged party must be put in the position in which it would be had the
contract been performed according to its terms.

Clause 60(2) of the Agreement also explicitly entitles Aucoven to recover
all its out-of-pocket expenses (loss incurred and assets contributed).

Aucoven is entitled to interest sufficient to make it whole for its loss.
Accordingly, the following principles must be applied in computing interest:

Interest should be granted as of the date on which Aucoven suffered
the damage. Specifically for lost profits, the relevant date is the date of
the alleged breach.

Consistent with the possibility of choice provided in the Concession
Agreement, Aucoven chose the “Bank Rate Method”.

The Concession Agreement, Venezuelan law, and international law all
require the award of compound interest.

iv. Interest shall run until the date of effective payment.

Relief sought

Because Venezuela persistently violated

its obligations under the

Concession Agreement, an award of costs and fees, including attorneys’

fees, would be particularly appropriate.

declare that

(a)

(b)

Concession Agreement in good faith; and

declare that

(a)

(b)

Aucoven was entitled to terminate the Concession
Agreement pursuant to Clause 60(2) and principles of
international law on grounds of Venezuela’s breaches; and

Agreement under Clause 60(2) and principles of
international law on grounds of Venezuela’s failure to
perform conditions precedent; and

award Aucoven damages in the amounts of

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

Between Bs. 22,178,316,000 (constant as of September
30, 1995) and Bs. 24,212,779,000 (constant as of
September 30, 1995) for the present value of Aucoven’s
lost profits for the term of the Concession through
December 31, 2026, plus interest at the rate prescribed in
the Concession Agreement;

Bs. 118,722,000 (constant as of September 30, 1995) as
out-of-pocket losses for Operating Years through March
31, 2000, plus interest at the rate prescribed in the
Concession Agreement;

Bs. 2,398,561,000 (constant as of September 30, 1995) as

Concession, as of May 31, 2000, plus interest at the rate
prescribed in the Concession Agreement;

Bs. 394,848,000 (constant as of September 30, 1995) as
out-of-pocket losses for the Operating Year ended on
March 31, 2001, through August 31, 2002, plus interest at
the rate prescribed in the Concession Agreement;

Bs. 341,417,000 (constant as of September 30, 1995) as
the net increase in the fair value of the assets contributed
by Aucoven to the Concession for the period June 1, 2000

through October August 31, 2002, plus interest at the rate
prescribed in the Concession Agreement;

() Post-award interest, at the rate prescribed in the
Concession Agreement, or, in the alternative, at the
highest rate allowed by applicable law;

(g) Aucoven’s costs and expenses, including legal fees,
incurred in connection with this arbitration, plus interest at
the rate prescribed in the Concession Agreement; and

(4) order that

(a) all amounts awarded Aucoven in constant bolivars be
updated as of the date of payment in accord with the
change in the Venezuelan Consumer Price Index (CPI)
since September 30, 1995; and

(b) all amounts awarded Aucoven be converted into U.S.
dollars at the most favorable available exchange rate and
be paid to a U.S. bank account designated by Aucoven; or,
in the alternative,

(c) notwithstanding any Venezuelan law or regulation to the
contrary, Aucoven be permitted to repatriate freely and
without encumbrance or delay all amounts awarded and
convert them into U.S. dollars at the most favorable
available exchange rate; and

(5) award Aucoven such other and further relief as the Tribunal
deems just and proper.

VENEZUELA
Position

Venezuela’s position is summarized in this Section. It will be further referred to in the
Section entitled "Discussion" as and when a specific issue is reviewed. In its written
and oral submissions, Venezuela has advanced the following main contentions:

a.  Aucoven’s purported unilateral termination as of June 13, 2000, was not
valid or effective under the Concession Agreement and Venezuelan law.

b. | Aucoven’s lost profits claim fails because of four independent legal
obstacles excluding Venezuela’s liability (Ven. PHR, p. 12), namely:

The civil unrest directed at the planned future toll increases made it
impossible for Venezuela to raise the tolls to the levels originally
contemplated by the Concession Agreement. “This circumstance
constituted a classic force majeure event and excused the Republic’s
contractual undertaking to increase the tolls to such levels“ (Ven. PHR,

26/113

2.

86.

87.

e.

p. 97 referring to Resp. Mem. at 18-24, 32-36; Rejoinder p. 15-38;
Ven. PHB, p. 15-38).

. Aucoven’s breaches of its own obligations under both the Concession

Agreement and the Highway Improvement Agreement constitute an
independent bar to Aucoven’s lost profits claim (Ven. PHR, p. 128).

Since Aucoven did not build any works nor make any investment in the
project, Aucoven is not entitled under the Economic-Financial
Equilibrium to pursue a claim for alleged “lost profits” based on mere
projected cash flows as set forth in the initial Economic-Financial Plan
(Ven. PHR, p. 141).

Since the projected cash flows under the initial EFP and the other
assumptions underlying Aucoven’s claim for lost profits are uncertain
and indeed speculative, such claim cannot be granted under
Venezuelan law, which provides that any claim for damages based on
an administrative contract be supported by non-speculative and
definite proof of actual loss (Ven. PHR, pp. 144-145).

Aucoven’s lost profits claim fails because, as a matter of economics,

Aucoven did not suffer any loss of future profits.

Aucoven is only due out-of-pocket costs that are permissible under the

Concession Agreement (Ven. PHR, p. 69 referring to Ven. Mem. at 84-89;
Rejoinder at 90-92; Ven PHB, at 102-104).

The Tribunal should not grant compound nor post-award interest.

Relief sought

Venezuela requests the Tribunal to make the following decisions (Ven. PHR, p.

157):

[...] Aucoven’s claims for lost profits and pre-award interests should
be denied in their entirety. Aucoven’s award for out-of-pocket
expenditures should be limited at most to Bs. 1,181,504,930
(constant September 1995). The Republic should be given the option
to pay this amount in updated bolivars or the dollar equivalent
thereof converted at the rate of Bs. 170 constant 1995 bolivars per
U.S. dollar (for a total of US$ 7.0 million) (Ven. PHR, p. 157).

Further on interest and costs, Venezuela requested the Tribunal to rule as follows:

27/113

88.

89.

90.

91.

The award in this case should not include any element for pre-award
interest (Ven. PHR, p. 86).

The Tribunal should not grant post-award interest (Ven. PHR, p.
149).

Interest should not be compounded in this case (Ven. PHR, p. 94).

Aucoven is not entitled to an award of legal fees and costs related to
the arbitration (Ven. PHR, p. 150).

[If] the Tribunal chooses to consider the shifting of legal costs from
one party to another — contrary to the usual ICSID practice — it is
Aucoven that should be ordered to reimburse the Republic for its
legal costs and other expense of the arbitration (Ven. PHR, p. 152).

DISCUSSION

PROCEDURAL ASPECTS

On September 27, 2001, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered its Decision on Jurisdiction in
respect of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention holding that it “has jurisdiction over the
dispute submitted to it in this arbitration’.

In its submissions on the merits, Venezuela has posited that Venezuelan law
reserves to the Venezuelan courts any issues related to the termination of the
Concession Agreement. Specifically, Venezuela points out that “Article 10 of Decree
Law Nr. 138 allows a Concession Agreement to submit to arbitration matters relating
to “interpretation or performance” of a concession contract, but not termination of
such a contract (Ven. PHR, p. 126, Fn 119).

If and to the extent that this contention must be understood as an objection to the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal, it cannot be taken into consideration. Indeed, it is
belated, because it was submitted well after the Decision on Jurisdiction.

Moreover, if the Tribunal were to consider it, which it does not, it would in any event
find it ill-founded. The Tribunal notes that Venezuela’s own legal expert at the
hearing recognized that “the arbitral tribunal would be the competent jurisdictional
entity” for issues of termination in accordance with Clause 64 of the Agreement (Tr.
729:7-19, spelling corrected). Such expert agreed with the statement that “there is
no reason why this tribunal could not enforce Clause 60 by declaring the contract
terminated as of June 13, 2000, if, in fact, it finds that Venezuela did indeed breach
as Aucoven alleges” (Tr. 730:8-19). Moreover, a jurisdictional challenge based on

an alleged exclusive jurisdiction of a Venezuelan authority would also violate the

28/113

92.

93.

94.

95.

well-established principle of international law pursuant to which a state cannot rely
on its domestic legislation to renege on a contractual obligation to resort to
arbitration (Christoph Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, Cambridge
2001, Nr. 95 ad Article 42; Stephen Schwebel, International Arbitration: Three
Salient Problems, pp. 68 ff. and ref.).

APPLICABLE LAW

The law to be applied by the Tribunal to the substance of the dispute is laid down in
Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention as follows:

The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of

law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such

agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State

party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and

such rules of international law as may be applicable.
The parties disagree on (1) whether they entered into a choice of law agreement
within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention,
and (2) which law should govern the dispute failing such an agreement.

Choice of law

Pursuant to its Preamble, the Concession Agreement “shall be governed by [...]
[Decree] Law Nr. 138 [...] Executive Decree Nr. 502 [...] and the provisions of any
other laws, regulations, or other documents as may be applicable”. Clause 5 of the
Concession Agreement provides that the latter “shall be governed by [Decree Law
138]; [Executive Decree Nr. 502]; by the Clauses and Annexes [of the Concession
Agreement]; by the terms set forth in the Bid submitted by [Aucoven]; and by the
conditions set forth in the Bid Documents.”

The parties disagree on the meaning of these provisions:

. Venezuela submits that, by agreeing to these provisions, “the parties reflected
their agreement that Venezuelan law should be applied to any dispute
concerning interpretation or application of the terms of the Concession
Contract” (Ven. PHB, p. 13).

. Aucoven argues that “the parties did not agree on Venezuelan law as the only
applicable law, as contemplated by the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the
Washington Convention” (Cl. PHB, {| 171, p. 37). Since “[t]he parties’
reference to particular Venezuelan laws cannot, in any event, be construed as

29/113

96.

97.

98.

4

an indication that they intended Venezuelan law to govern the Concession
Agreement exclusively” (Cl. PHB, | 172, p. 37), and since the Contract
Preamble contemplates that some other law might be applicable (CI. PHB, {|
170, p. 37), Aucoven submits that the Concession Agreement “does not
provide for the exclusive application of Venezuelan law” (Cl. PHB, {| 169, p.
36).

The Tribunal observes that the first sentence of Article 42(1) refers to “rules of law”
rather than to systems of law. It is generally accepted that this wording allows the
parties to agree on a partial choice of law, and in particular to select specific rules
from a system of law. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Clause 5 of the Agreement
represent a valid choice of law agreement providing for the application of Decree
Law 138 and Executive Decree Nr. 502.

The Tribunal further notes that the reference to specific texts of Venezuelan law, i.e.,
Decree Law 138 and Executive Decree Nr. 502, does not necessarily amount to a
general choice of Venezuelan law. As pointed out by both parties, such an
“extension” of the choice of law was accepted in LETCO v. Liberia, where the
Tribunal considered that an agreement to apply “the General Business Law, Title 15
of the Liberian Code of Laws of 1956” was a general choice of Liberian Law.’ The
parties disagree on the relevance of LETCO v. Liberia for the present case.
Venezuela insists on the fact that the “specific choice of local law was made based
on contract provisions and other circumstances less compelling than those in the
present case” (Ven. Rejoinder, p. 10), while Aucoven emphasizes that “[uJnlike the
Concession Agreement, the contract [in LETCO v. Liberia] did not refer to “any other
laws, regulations, or other documents that may be applicable” (Cl. PHB, {| 170, p. 37
Fn. 1).

In the Tribunal’s view, the answer hinges upon the interpretation of the terms
“... and the provisions of any other laws, regulations, or other documents as may be
applicable”, which follow the choice of the two Venezuelan decrees in the
Concession Agreement’s Preamble. Does this language constitute an implied choice
of any other Venezuelan laws or regulations, with the result that the Preamble
embodies a general choice of Venezuelan law, as Venezuela submits? Or should

Liberian Eastern Timber Corporation (LETCO) v. Liberia, \CSID Case No.ARB/83/2, Award, March 31,
1986, 2 ICSID Reports 343, Ven. Auth. 4, at 358.

30/113,

99.

100.

101.

102.

the relevant passage be viewed as an implied reference to international law, as
Aucoven argues? Or should such language be understood as it reads, i.e., without a
specification in favor of Venezuelan law, with the result that the Preamble contains a
partial choice of Venezuelan law and, beyond that, leaves the determination of the
governing law to the ICSID Convention?

In support of the first assumption, Venezuela submits that such an interpretation is
“consistent with the general rule in Venezuela that Venezuelan administrative
contracts, like the [Concession Agreement], are governed by Venezuelan law” (Ven.
PHB, p. 13). The Tribunal believes, however, that this consideration is not sufficient
to establish the parties’ mutual intent to submit their contract to Venezuelan law

exclusively.

The parties could easily have adopted language showing their common intent to
apply exclusively Venezuelan law, i.e., they could easily have expressed their
agreement on a general choice of Venezuelan law in the Concession Agreement.
Had they meant to provide for international law, they could also have expressed it.
But they did not. Failing any indication on record demonstrating that, when agreeing
on the Preamble’s wording the parties impliedly meant to provide for a general
choice of Venezuelan law or for international law, the Tribunal comes to the
conclusion that, except for the matters covered by Venezuelan Decree Law Nr. 138
and Executive Decree Nr. 502, it must look to the second sentence of Article 42(1).

Applicable law failing a choice of law agreement

In the absence of an agreement of the parties, the second sentence of Article 42(1)
of the ICSID Convention provides that “the Tribunal shall apply the law of the
Contracting State party to the dispute [...] and such rules of international law as may
be applicable.”

The role of international law in ICSID practice is not entirely clear. It is certainly well
settled that international law may fill lacunae when national law lacks rules on
certain issues (so called complementary function). It is also established that it may
correct the result of the application of national law when the latter violates
international law (corrective function) (Christoph Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A
Commentary, Cambridge 2001, Nr. 131 ad Art. 42, p. 623 with ref.). Does the role of
international law extend beyond these functions? The recent decision of the ICSID
Ad hoc Committee in Wena Hotels Ltd. V. Arab Republic of Egypt accepts the
possibility of a broad approach to the role of international law, and that the arbitral

106.

tribunal has “a certain margin and power of interpretation” (ICSID Case Nr.
ARB/98/4, 41 I.L.M. 933 (2002), Nr. 39 p. 941). Whatever the extent of the role that
international law plays under Article 42(1) (second sentence), this Tribunal believes
that there is no reason in this case, considering especially that it is a contract and
not a treaty arbitration, to go beyond the corrective and supplemental functions of
international law.

The parties accept that international law would prevail over Venezuelan law if the
latter were in conflict with the former (Cl. PHB, {| 174, p. 38; Ven PHB, p. 13). As a
general proposition, they further agree that Venezuelan law is not inconsistent with
international law. In fact, Aucoven states that “the basic and fundamental legal
principles on which this case must be decided are common to both systems” (Cl.
PHB, {] 168, p. 36), while Venezuela asserts that “the application of Venezuelan
legal principles in this instance [would not] in any way violate international law” (Ven
PHB, p. 14).

Despite theses statements, the parties raise certain inconsistencies between
Venezuelan and international law, so for instance with respect to the standard of
impossibility of force majeure. The Arbitral Tribunal will review these alleged
inconsistencies as and when they arise in the course of the discussion and decide
whether they amount to violations of international law, with the result that the latter

would then prevail over Venezuelan law.

In conclusion, the Arbitral Tribunal holds that this dispute must be resolved by
application of the Decree Law 138 and Executive Decree Nr. 502 (pursuant to the
first sentence of Article 42(1)) and, for matters not covered by such decrees, by any
other pertinent rule of Venezuelan law (pursuant to the second sentence of Article
42(1)). Moreover, it holds that international law prevails over conflicting national

rules.

VENEZUELA’S FAILURE TO RAISE THE TOLLS AND FORCE MAJEURE

Venezuela concedes that it was unable to increase the toll rates as provided by
Clause 31 of the Concession Agreement. It submits, however, that Aucoven has

110.

failed “to demonstrate that the Republic’s inability to increase toll rates was not
excused by force majeure events” (Ven. PHR, p. 12).

The legal ingredients of force majeure and the burden of proof

The Tribunal cannot follow Aucoven’s argument that the Agreement provides for full
compensation even in case of force majeure occurred. In particular, the Tribunal
notes that the contractual force majeure defined in Clause 41(2) expressly refers to
circumstances that impede the Concessionaire to perform. The Agreement thus
addresses the situation in which Aucoven is prevented from performing due to a
force majeure event that affects itself. It does not deal with a situation where
Venezulea’s performance becomes impossible as a result of force majeure. Hence,
the consequences of force majeure are not governed by contract, but must be
assessed according to the applicable law.

It is common ground between the parties that force majeure is a valid excuse for the
non-performance of a contractual obligation in both Venezuelan and international
law. It is further common ground that the following conditions must be fulfilled for a

force majeure excuse:

- Impossibility (Cl. PHR, §] 26), ie., the force majeure event made
performance impossible to achieve (Ven. PHR, p. 98).

- Unforeseeability (Cl. PHR, {| 30), i.e., the force majeure event was not
foreseeable (Ven. PHR, p. 105).

- Non-attributability (Cl. PHR, {] 32), i.e., the force majeure event was not
attributable to the defeating party (Ven. PHB, p. 27).

It is, however, disputed between the parties whether the record establishes that
there was force majeure (CI. PHR, {| 25; Ven. PHR, p. 97) and, specifically, whether
the 1997 events meet the force majeure conditions.

Before turning to each single condition, it is necessary to clarify the burden of proof,
since the parties appear to express divergent views in this respect (Ven. PHR, pp.
12-13; Cl. PHR, 31). As a matter of principle, each party has the burden of proving
the facts upon which it relies. This is a well-established principle of both Venezuelan
and international law. Accordingly, it is up to Venezuela, which relies upon the force
majeure excuse, to prove that the conditions of force majeure are met.

Was the 1997 unrest foreseeable?

Venezuela argues in substance “that, as of the time that the Contract was signed,
the parties could not and did not foresee a protest of such magnitude and
threatened violence that it would undermine the entire financing mechanism for the
construction project, which both sides acknowledge was the very reason for the
Republic to enter into the Concession Contract in the first instance” (Ven PHB, p.
27; Ven PHR, p. 105). It relies specifically upon the declaration of a witness called
by Aucoven who testifies that Venezuela “had not anticipated the degree to which
drivers of heavy trucks would oppose the toll rate increases” (Ven. PHB, p. 26
referring to Tr. 257:6-13). Venezuela stresses that the relevant element of inquiry is
whether the protests that actually took place were foreseeable and not whether the
mere “prospect of political opposition” was foreseeable.

Aucoven points out that a Venezuelan public official admitted that “there was always
this concern that there could be a Caracazo” (Cl. PHB, {] 207, p. 47 referring to Tr.
350:14-15; 352:18-20 (Orozco); see also Cl. PHR, {] 30, p. 8) i.e., a social explosion
leading to a considerable amount of deaths.® If there was “always” a fear of a
Caracazo redux, so argues Aucoven, “that fear must have existed not only a few
days after the signing of the Concession Agreement, but also when the Concession
Agreement was negotiated and signed” (Cl. PHR, {J 30, p. 8; Cl. PHB, {| 124, pp.
206-208; Reply, {| 56).

On the one hand, the Tribunal finds that General Orozco’s declaration according to
which “there was always this concern that there could be a Caracazo” should be
replaced in its context, namely the position of Venezuelan law enforcement official
“reviewing the problem, at the time where the popular discontent began...” (Tr.
352:3-4). In the Tribunal’s view, Aucoven puts to much weight on the single word
“always” when it contends that “[I]f there was “always” a fear of a Caracazo redux,
that fear must have existed [...] also when the Concession Agreement was
negotiated and signed” (Cl. PHR, {] 30, p. 8; Cl. PHB, {J 124, pp. 206-208; Reply {|
56).

As explained by General Orozco, the Caracazo was a political phenomenon that occured in 1989 following
an encrease in the price of gasoline and, consequently, the price of transportation. The snowball-effect in
popular discontent necessitated the intervention of the armed forces and ended up with 200 deaths. (Tr
351:7 - 352:17).

34/113,

114.

115.

116.

117.

On the other hand, the impact of the tragic events of the 1989 Caracazo cannot be
underestimated. The Encyclopedia of Venezuela describes the events of February
1989 as follows (Cl. Ex. 140):

The people, who became protagonists, began to come down from the hills,
their place of residence, toward afternoon to take shopping and business
centers by storms, looting these places to seize all types of products [...]
Some main streets of the cities were also taken by mobs, which built
barricades and burned public transportation buses, private vehicles and
tires, clearly protesting against the increase in the transportation service
costs. [...] [This] massive popular and fundamentally spontaneous social
explosion [first led to] the most serious governmental and political crisis of
the democratic era had occurred [...] [and later to] a repressive phase in
which the military began to control the situation in the ghettos in whatever
way possible, which gave rise to all types of excesses. One week later the
official figures exceeded three hundred deaths, and the material losses
were incalculable.
Considering the impact of the Caracazo on Venezuelan society in general — and on
the political system in particular — (see also Tr. 352:15-17 and 350:14-15, where
General Orozco states that “certainly this left the Country marked” and that
Venezuela still “bears the scars”), one cannot reasonably argue that Venezuelan
Officials negotiating the Agreement could ignore that the increase in transportation
price resulting from the contractual mechanism of toll rate increase could at least
potentially lead to violent popular protest similar to the one of 1989. This is also
supported by Mr. Salas, appearing on behalf of Aucoven, whose testimony
confirmed that the Ministry wanted to avoid protests of the kind of the Caracazo (Tr.

255:19; 256:3).

The Tribunal finds additional support for this view in Venezuela’s submission that
“[s]oon after the parties signed the Contract and before any attempt to implement
any toll increases, it became apparent that strong public resistance to toll increases
could imperil the Concession’s future” (Ven. Counter-Memorial, p. 18). Venezuela
did not establish, or even explain, the reasons why the strong public resistance was
apparent shortly after the signature of the Agreement and before any actual attempt
to increase the tolls, while it was unforeseeable shortly before during the negotiation
of the contract. In these conditions, the Tribunal is not convinced that the possibility
of strong popular resistance to toll increase became apparent only after the

conclusion of the Concession Agreement.

Venezuela finally claims that “[t]he fact is that the parties could not and did not
foresee a protest of such magnitude and threatened violence” (Ven. PHR, p. 105
referring to Ven. Counter-Memorial, p. 35; Rejoinder, pp. 27-28; Ven. PHB, pp. 26-

35/113,

118.

119.

27). Accordingly, Venezuela seems to recognize (or at least not to deny) that some
public resistance was foreseeable. What it denies is the foreseeability of the
magnitude of such resistance. The Tribunal finds that the evidence before it, and in
particular the testimony concerning the impact of the Caracazo on Venezuela
society, clearly demonstrated that if popular protest could be foreseen, then the
possibility of very violent protest could not be ruled out.

Given the well known tragic precedent of the Caracazo and the similar impact on the
population of the contractual toll increase, Venezuela did not convince the Tribunal
that the possibility of civil unrest could not be foreseen at the time of the negotiation
of the Concession Agreement. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the alleged
impossibility of raising the toll was not unforeseeable.

For lack of unforeseeability, Venezuela's non-performance cannot be excused on
the ground of force majeure. Hence, whether the conditions of impossibility and
attributability are met is not decisive. For the sake of completeness, since the parties
have extensively tried these issues, they will nevertheless be addressed.

Did the 1997 unrest meet the requirement of impossibility?

Impossibility in the present context raises three main questions: (1) What is the
impossibility standard governing under Venezuelan law? (2) Does international law

lity

 

impose a different standard? (3) Do the facts of this case amount to impossi
under the relevant standard?

On the first question just set out, the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the
impossibility standard applicable under Venezuelan administrative law as described
by Prof. Badell. Under this standard, it is not necessary that the force majeure event
be irresistible; it suffices that by all reasonable judgment the event impedes the
normal performance of the contract. Prof. Badell’s evidence to such effect relies on
several authorities on administrative contracts.” By contrast, the evidence of

‘In administrative law, it is not necessary that the event alleged as force majeure be insurmountable or
irresistible for justifying the non-performance of what was agreed to; it suffices that by all reasonable
judgment the event impedes the normal execution of the contract, and therefore it is not necessary that
such inability be absolute” (Miguel BERcaITz, Teoria General de los Contratos Administrativos, 1980,
Badell Auth. 18, p. 578). It is with respect to this aspect that the force majeure exhibits a characteristic that
is unique to administrative law, which thus allows it to be differentiated from the notion of force majeure in
private law. [...] There shall or may be “force majeure” when an external and unpredictable event disturbs
or changes, in a “definitive” manner, the equilibrium of the contract. “Insurmountable” is replaced by
“definitive” (Miguel MaRIENHOFF, Tratado de Derecho Administrativo, 4" Ed. 1983, Badell Auth 24, p.
359).

36/113,

122.

123.

124.

125.

126.

Aucoven’s legal expert pursuant to which an element of “absolute impossibility” is
required to assert force majeure in administrative contracts is not sufficiently
supported.

Accordingly, the issue before this Tribunal with respect to impossibility may be
summarized as follows: did the civil unrest in 1997 impede the increase of the toll

rates by reasonable judgment?

On the second question set forth above, the Arbitral Tribunal is not satisfied that
international law imposes a different standard which would be called to displace the
application of national law. The Tribunal reaches this conclusion on the basis of a
review of the decisions issued under international law to which the parties have
referred (see in particular General Dynamics Telephone Sys. Ctr. v. The Islamic
Republic of Iran, Award No. 192-285-2 (4 Oct. 1985), 9 Iran-U.S. Cl. Trib. Rep. 153,
160, Resp. Auth. 18. See also Gould Marketing, Inc. v. Ministry of Defense of Iran,
Award No. ITL 24-49-2 (27 July 1983), 3 Iran-US Cl. Trib. Rep. 147, Cl. Auth. 23,
and Sylvania Tech. Sys., Inc. v. Iran, Award No. 180-64-1 (27 June 1985), 8 Iran-
U.S. Cl. Trib. Rep. 298, Cl. Auth. 32.), as well as on the basis of the Draft Articles on
State Responsibility of the International Law Commission, and the legal arguments

of the parties.

On the third and last question, Venezuela admits that the civil protest was not
irresistible in the sense that it could not have been mastered by the use of force.
This being so, the question then becomes: by all reasonable judgment how much
force can a State be legally required to deploy to perform its contract obligations?
The answer to this question implies a delicate assessment that calls in part for
political judgment. Considering its determination on unforeseeability, the Arbitral
Tribunal will not finally resolve it. Suffices it to state that this Tribunal is rather
inclined to find that, in consideration of the events of 1989 and of the risk of

repetition, the impossibility requirement appears met.

Was the 1997 civil unrest attributable to Venezuela?

Like the answer on impossibility, the determination of attributability is not dispositive
of the force majeure defense. For the sake of completeness, it is nevertheless briefly
discussed.

It is a well-settled principle of international law that a State is responsible for the
conduct of all public authorities within its territory. That principle is not seriously

37/113,

129.

130.

disputed by Venezuela. It has recently been restated by an ICSID Ad hoc
Committee in Compania de Agua del Aconquija S.A. v. Argentine Republic, as
follows:
Under international law [...] it is well established that actions of a
political subdivision of a federal state [...] are attributable to the
central government. It is equally clear that the internal constitutional
structure of a country cannot alter these obligations.®
The fact that “the Venezuelan Constitution ascribes separate legal identity to the
federal, state and municipal governments, and that the actions of one may not be
attributed to another “ (Ven. PHB, p. 29 referring to Badell Supp. {| 35 and Rejoinder
28-29) may be accurate, but is irrelevant for the present purposes.

The evidence provided at the hearing by Venezuela’s federal government officials
showed that “they worked tirelessly with Aucoven to solve the problems with the
Contract and that the Republic was not responsible for the protests” (Ven. PHB, p.
27). In spite of these efforts, the fact remains and was admitted by Venezuela that
the protest had the “full support of the local government [...] of the State of Vargas”
(Ven. Counter-Memorial, p. 19; see also Ven. PHB, p. 29, where Venezuela
emphasizes the role of some local officials to quell the protests, but does not deny
the fact that local government supported the protest). To which extent such support
was causal for the protests or their seriousness is not readily apparent from the
record. In view of the finding on unforeseeability, there is no need for this Tribunal to
make a final judgment on this issue here.

Conclusion

On the basis of the foregoing developments, the Tribunal concludes that
Venezuela's breach of its contractual obligation to raise the tolls is not excused by

force majeure.

THE FAILURE TO ISSUE THE GUARANTEE AND THE RISK OF ILLEGALITY

The conclusion just reached with respect to force majeure is sufficient in and of itself
to declare that Aucoven was entitled to terminate the Concession Agreement and to
claim damages as a matter of principle pursuant to Clause 60(2). These matters will

be reviewed in Section IV.F to H below. However, since Aucoven expressly requests

the Tribunal to declare that “Venezuela breached Clauses 19, 22, 23, 27, 28, 31, 32,
33, 40, 44, 45, 46, and Annex A of the Concession Agreement’, the Tribunal will
look at the other breaches alleged by Aucoven in the next Sections. It will devote
more significant developments to the alleged breach of the obligation to issue the
guarantee - in Aucoven’s words, the other “most devastating breach” next to the
failure to raise the tolls (Cl. PHR, ] 5) - and more limited developments to the
others.

Clause 22 of the Agreement provides the following in respect of payment
guarantees:

In accordance with the provision of Article 46 of Decree Nr. 138

having the scope and force of Organic Law, at the request of THE

CONCESSIONAIRE, THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE shall grant

multilateral entities, within two (2) months from THE

CONCESSIONAIRE’S request, or other financing entities within

twenty (20) business days from said request one or more guarantees

to ensure the payment of THE CONCESSIONAIRE’S debts.
When Aucoven negotiated to obtain a loan of US$ 50 million from ING Bank, the
latter (Cl. Ex. 26, Martinez | | 37) required that the loan be secured by a satisfactory
governmental guarantee (Cl. Ex. 26; Cl. Ex. 129). On May 28, 1997, Aucoven
requested that Venezuela issue a guarantee pursuant to Clause 22 of the
Concession Agreement (Cl. Ex. 26). It is undisputed that Venezuela did not issue
the guarantee within 20 business days of that request (Ven PHR, p. 112: “the
granting of the guarantee was delayed when the Minister of Finance - the
government official normally responsible for financial undertakings of the Republic -
determined that the Organic Law of Public Credit prohibited him from executing any
guarantee”).

Venezuela argues that the Organic Law of Public Credit prohibited the Minister of
Finance to issue the guarantee as required by Clause 22 of the Agreement and that
Aucoven knew, prior to signing the Concession Agreement, that there was a conflict
of (Venezuelan) laws that might prevent or delay the issuance of guarantee. Relying
upon the testimony of its legal expert, Venezuela submits that, under Venezuelan
law, “Aucoven’s actual prior knowledge of the conflict and its implications for
potential lenders means that Aucoven must bear full responsibility for assuming the
risk of the illegality of the guarantee”. (Ven. PHR, p. 113 referring to Badell Supp. J]
54; Tr. 746:10; 747:11). Accordingly, Aucoven’s knowledge would bar any claim of
breach of contract (Ven. PHR, p. 113).

39/113,

134.

135.

136.

137.

Aucoven responds that Venezuela’s failure to issue the guarantee cannot be
excused. Clause 22 of the Agreement was not illegal under Venezuelan law. Both
the Minister of Infrastructure and the Attorney General of Venezuela recognized that
the issuance of the guarantee was legal. Moreover, even assuming that Clause 22
of the Agreement was illegal under Venezuela law, “it is well established that as a
matter of international law a State cannot excuse its nonperformance of a
contractual provision by relying on an alleged illegality under domestic law” (Cl.
PHR, 17] 46-48).

The knowledge of the risk of illegality of the guarantee

It is undisputed that on November 18, 1996, i.e., prior to the execution of the
Concession Agreement, Aucoven received a letter from Corporacién Andina de
Fomento (CAF), alerting it to the existence of conflicting rules and the resulting
uncertainty in the following terms:
[...] due to the uncertainty of a legal nature existing about the
Republic’s guarantee, it is indispensable to have absolute certainty
concerning the validity of such guarantee. In this matter, CAF will
only be satisfied by a pronouncement by the Supreme Court of
Justice declaring in a clear and unobjectionable way, the prevailing
nature of the norm set forth in Decree Law Nr. 138 that pertains to

us, over that which is established in the Public Credit Law (Ven. Ex.
15).

The legal consequences of Aucoven’s knowledge of the risk

Venezuela argues that, knowing about the risk of illegality, Aucoven should have
required a clarification before concluding the Concession Agreement. Having failed
to do so, Aucoven must bear full responsibility for assuming the risk of the illegality
of the guarantee and, consequently, Aucoven’s claim of breach of contract is barred.
Indeed, according to Venezuela’s legal expert, Venezuelan law provides for a pre-
contractual obligation to negotiate in good faith. Citing domestic case law, Prof.
Badell referred to the following rule:

[W]hen one party to a contract hides from the other party a

Significant fact that would make the contract invalid, but later raises it

after the contract has been signed, such behavior constitutes bad

faith which bars the first party from taking advantage of the

consequence of the facts kept from the other party’s knowledge

(Badell Supp., ] 60, p. 30).
Aucoven does not challenge Prof. Badell’s opinion on this point. Rather, it argues in

substance that such knowledge is not a “significant fact” within the meaning of

40/113

21

138.

139.

2.2

140.

Venezuelan law, and that, as a matter of international law, Venezuela cannot rely on

illegality under domestic law.
The significance of the risk of illegality under Venezuelan law

Aucoven seeks to downplay the risk of conflicting rules preventing the issuance of
guarantees by emphasizing that CAF was not part of the Venezuelan Government
and that Clause 22 was legal, so that it cannot have assumed any risk with respect

to a non-existing illegality.

As a matter of common sense, the fact that Clause 22 turned out to be legal does
not necessarily mean that no risk existed.° Similarly, the fact that CAF is not a
Venezuelan governmental entity is equally irrelevant. CAF is a well-recognized
financial institution in Latin America. It expressed a concern, which fell in its field of
expertise, that is loans to governmental entities, and related to a country within its
traditional geographical scope of activity, that is Venezuela. The risk of illegality was
not as insignificant as Aucoven now seeks to demonstrate. In reality, Aucoven was
well aware of the significance of the risk. This is clear from its letter of February 19,
1997 advising Venezuela of the legal concerns raised by CAF. In such letter,
Aucoven insisted that it was “of the utmost importance” to clarify the legal
uncertainties, because the latter “might affect the feasibility of the [Concession
Agreement]” and the feasibility of the “entire National Concessions Program” (Resp.
Ex. 23 at 1-2).

The role of Venezuela’s representation about the legality of the guarantee

Whatever the significance of the risk, the Tribunal cannot overlook the wording in
the Preamble to the Concession Agreement pursuant to which the parties did
“assert and guarantee that their obligations are legal, valid, binding and enforceable”
(Cl. PHR, {| 46). Such representation obviously also applies to the obligation
embodied in Clause 22. It is true that, literally, this representation is stated to be
given by both parties. However, it must obviously be read to mean that each party
“guaranteed” the legality of its own obligations only.

From this perspective, Aucoven’s argument that “no Venezuelan authority, including the Venezuelan
Supreme Court, has ever opined that the conflict about which the CAF official speculated actually exists, or
that it would be resolved by declaring Article 46 of Decree Law No. 138 null and void” is also irrelevant.

41/113

141.

142.

143.

144.

145.

In the Tribunal’s opinion, by giving such representation, Venezuela assumed the risk
of illegality of the issuance of any guarantees. The Tribunal cannot see how the risk
would then be shifted to Aucoven by the mere fact that the latter was aware of a
potential illegality.

As a consequence of the determination just reached, there is no need to address
Aucoven’s main argument that, under international law, a state cannot excuse its
non-performance of a contractual obligation by relying on an alleged illegality under
the domestic law.

Conclusion

On the basis of the foregoing developments, the Tribunal concludes that Venezuela
breached its obligation to issue the guarantee according to Clause 22 of the
Concession Agreement.

OTHER BREACHES OF THE CONCESSION AGREEMENT

Aucoven claims that Venezuela committed additional breaches of the Concession
Agreement, by violating (a) its obligation to maintain the Economic-Financial
Equilibrium under Clauses 44-46 and Annex A (below, Section 1), (b) its obligation
to compensate for additional and excess works under Clauses 25 and 46(1) (below,
Section 2), (c) its obligation to exempt Aucoven from specific taxes under Clauses
27 and 28 of the Agreement (below, Section 3), (d) its obligation to pay the Minimum
Guaranteed Income under Clause 23 of the Agreement (below, Section 4), (e) its
obligation to approve the trust agreement under Clause 40 of the Agreement (below,
Section 5), (f) its obligation to resort exclusively to arbitration under Clause 64 of the
Agreement (below, Section 6), and (g) its obligation to act in good faith implied in
every contract (below, Section 7). The Arbitral Tribunal will review these alleged
breaches in this order.

Obligation to maintain the Economic-Financial Equilibrium

According to Aucoven, Venezuela breached its obligation to maintain the Economic-
Financial Equilibrium or EFE provided in Clauses 44-46 and Annex A of the
Concession Agreement “by failing to compensate Aucoven for the shortfall in
revenues and additional costs that were not attributable to Aucoven” (Cl. PHB, {|
250, p. 60). Venezuela had the choice to “compensate Aucoven by raising the
Highway tolls or making direct payments to Aucoven”, but did neither (Cl. PHB, {|
253, p.60).

42/113

146.

147.

148.

149.

Venezuela argues that “Aucoven has never actually established any ‘shortfall’ in
revenues as compared to its actual costs”. Moreover, it submits that “Aucoven's
remedy, if it were in fact suffering a revenue shortfall, was to submit an updated
EFP”, which it never did (Ven. PHR, p. 120).

Aucoven replies that Venezuela never suggested at the time that it could not restore
the EFE because Aucoven had not updated the EFP. It also responds that “the
Concession Agreement made the updating of the EFP the joint responsibility of both
parties” (Cl. PHR, {| 57-59, pp. 15-16). In addition, Aucoven alleges that it did in fact
update the EFP on one occasion in November 1998, within the context of the
parties’ negotiations with the Inter-American Development Bank (Cl. PHB, {[ 257, p.
61).

Clause 44 of the Concession Agreement reads as follows:

THE MINISTRY guarantees THE CONCESSIONAIRE the Economic-
Financial Equilibrium of the Concession, according to the Economic-
Financial Plan, the updates thereof, and the terms and conditions for the
financing negotiated with financial institutions. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the Economic-Financial Equilibrium shall be understood to exist
when THE CONCESSIONAIRE is able to cover its costs and obtain fair and
equitable remuneration by collecting the toll rates.

LJ

In accordance with the provisions of Article 43 of the Decree having the
scope and force of Organic Law Nr. 138, the Economic-Financial Equilibrium
of the Concession shall be maintained at all times in order to ensure the
continuity of the service to be rendered by THE CONCESSIONAIRE and the
performance of the corresponding services and work.

THE MINISTRY shall restore the Economic-Financial Equilibrium of the
Concession in a timely manner. As long as THE MINISTRY does not restore
the Economic-Financial Equilibrium, THE CONCESSIONAIRE shall be
prevented from fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this Concession, limiting
itself to performing routine maintenance work and/or collecting tolls.

Annex A to the Concession Agreement defines the parameters of the Economic-
Financial Equilibrium in the following terms:

Pursuant to Clause 44, it shall be understood that the Economic-Financial
Equilibrium of the Concession exists when THE CONCESSIONAIRE is able
to recover, in timely fashion, the capital contributed, the loans received, the
interest on those loans, the professional fees, the investments, the actual
costs and expenses incurred, the contributions and taxes that are not

43/113

150.

151.

152.

exempted, the commissions and in general any other costs and expenses
that THE CONCESSIONAIRE has incurred [...].

Clause 45 further stipulates as follows:

LJ

THE MINISTRY shall compensate THE CONCESSIONAIRE through the
Direct Payment System and/or the Rate Increase System for any event not
attributable to THE CONCESSIONAIRE that affects the Economic-Financial
Equilibrium [...]

Moreover, according to Clause 46:

THE MINISTRY shall maintain the Economic-Financial Equilibrium of the
Concession using the mathematical model of the Economic-Financial Plan
described in Annex A hereto, by means of payments and adjustments made
in the manner indicated in this Clause, whenever one of the following events
[...] occurs [a list of events follows].
The provisions just referred to establish the following contractual features in respect
of the Economic-Financial Equilibrium:

- The Economic-Financial Equilibrium is determined in relation with the
Economic-Financial Plan, the updates thereof, and the terms and conditions
for the financing negotiated with financial institutions (Clause 44(1));

- The Economic-Financial Equilibrium exists when Aucoven is able to cover
its costs and obtain fair and equitable remuneration by collecting the tolls
(Clause 44(1));

- The Economic-Financial Equilibrium will be maintained at all times by
Venezuela and, when needed, restored in a timely manner (Clause 44(3)
and (4)). If the Economic-Financial Equilibrium is not restored, Aucoven is
under no duty to perform its obligations, except routine maintenance and toll
collection (Clause 44(4));

- If events not attributable to Aucoven affect the Economic-Financial
Equilibrium, Venezuela must compensate the Claimant through the "Direct
Payments System" or through the "Rate Increase System" (Clause 45).
These systems are described in Annex A to the Concession Agreement;

- Venezuela will maintain the Economic-Financial Equilibrium using the
mathematical model of the Economic-Financial Plan set forth in Annex A

44/113,

153.

154.

155.

156.

when certain events occur (Clause 46). In such case, Aucoven must notify
Venezuela of the occurrence and submit an updated Economic-Financial
Plan (Clause 46, Paragraph 1).

In connection with the update of the Economic-Financial Plan, Clause 47 of the

Concession Agreement provides an obligation of Aucoven in the following terms:

THE CONCESSIONAIRE is obligated to update the Economic-Financial Plan
whenever any of the following circumstances arises: when a circumstance or
Event occurs, described in the preceding Clause, or when for any reason it is
impossible to maintain the Economic-Financial Equilibrium as indicated in
Clause 44 hereof. THE CONCESSIONAIRE shall submit to THE MINISTRY
the updated Economic-Financial Plan, and THE MINISTRY shall reestablish
said balance by means of the Rate Increase System and/or Direct Payments.

Accordingly, Aucoven had the obligation to submit an updated Economic-Financial
Plan whenever it was impossible to maintain the Economic-Financial Equilibrium "for
any reason". This makes good sense, since the Economic-Financial Equilibrium was
directly related to the Economic-Financial Plan and was supposed to exist when
Aucoven was able to recover, amongst other, the capital contributed and the actual
costs and expenses incurred. Yet the related data was necessarily in Aucoven’s
control.

This understanding is confirmed by Annex A to the Concession Agreement, which
shows that the initiative for an update must come from Aucoven:

THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE, in the name of the REPUBLIC OF
VENEZUELA, through THE MINISTRY, shall maintain and be required to
maintain the Economic-Financial Equilibrium of the Concession at all times
pursuant to Decree having the scope of Organic Law Nr. 138 [...] and
pursuant to this Agreement, by means of updating the Economic-
Financial Plan at the request of THE CONCESSIONAIRE [...]. (Emphasis
added).

Aucoven appears to have understood the need to update the Economic-Financial
Plan to maintain the Economic-Financial Equilibrium, which is confirmed by

evidence given by Mr. Martinez:

"Q. Do you agree that Clause 44 of the contract sets forth a definition of the
economic-financial equilibrium that governs the relationship between
Aucoven and the Ministry during the life of this contract?

A. Just one moment, please.
(Witness reviews document.)

45/113

157.

158.

159.

| do understand it this way.

Q. And as you mentioned earlier, isn't it true that the economic-financial
equilibrium is to be maintained by use of the Economic-Financial Plan and
updates thereto?

A. That is correct (Tr. 172:6-18).

Clause 46 of the Concession Agreement further shows that it was Aucoven’s duty to
provide updated EFPs. Venezuela had the obligation to approve the adjusted rates
only after reception of the updated EFP. Indeed, Clause 46 provides the following:

Paragraph One: THE CONCESSIONAIRE shall notify THE MINISTRY when
one or more Events have occurred and shall submit the updated Economic-
Financial Plan." (emphasis added)

Paragraph Two: Within fifteen (15 ) business days from each date upon
which THE MINISTRY receives from THE CONCESSIONAIRE the updated
Economic-Financial Plan forming the basis for applying the Rate Increase
System and/or the Direct Payment required to maintain the Economic-
Financial Equilibrium of the Concession, THE MINISTRY shall approve the
adjusted rates and publish them in the Official Gazette of the Republic of
Venezuela and/or deliver the corresponding payment order to THE
CONCESSIONAIRE, as applicable.
It is thus the Tribunal’s view that Aucoven had the obligation to submit an updated
Economic-Financial Plan in order to obtain the restoration of the EFE by Venezuela.
Subject to the following paragraph, it is undisputed that Aucoven did not submit such
an updated Economic-Financial Plan. It is common ground as well that Venezuela
did not ask for it. Whatever the reasons for such silence, it cannot modify Aucoven’s
obligations.

Aucoven alleges that it did in fact update the Economic-Financial Plan “on one
occasion in November 1998, within the context of the parties' negotiations with the
Inter-American Development Bank, on the basis of the assumptions made by the
parties in connection with the possible restructuring of the project by use of the VIAL
Ill program” (see above, Section |.G; Cl. PHB, {] 257, p. 61). However, the record
shows that this updated EFP was specifically related to the refinancing package that
was being negotiated then and never entered into effect. Therefore, it could not
serve as a basis for restoration of the EFE.

46/113

160.

161.

162.

163.

164.

165.

In the absence of an updated Economic-Financial Plan, the Tribunal holds that
Venezuela did not breach its obligation to maintain the Economic-Financial

Equilibrium by not compensating Aucoven.

Obligation to compensate Aucoven for additional and excess works

Aucoven claims that Venezuela breached the Concession Agreement by failing to
compensate it for additional and excess works, carried out in accordance with
Clauses 25 and 46 of the Concession Agreement.

These works are also the subject of a claim for out-of-pocket expenses (Section
IV.G.3.6). Venezuela admits this claim, save for an amount equivalent to US$
180,000, stating that "now that the Ministry has received valuations in connection
with the arbitration, the Republic considers that reimbursement of the authorized
work would be appropriate as part of an award of out-of-pocket expenses" (Ven.
PHB, p. 51).

Although it now concedes that most of the amounts claimed are due, Venezuela
considers that it did not breach the Concession Agreement for the reason that, in
some cases, the work performed was neither contemplated by the Concession
Agreement nor authorized by the Ministry, and, in other instances, Aucoven had not
provided the Ministry with the appropriate documentation to permit compensation.
To the extent Aucoven was not compensated for any authorized additional works
through toll revenues, its contractual remedy was to submit a revised EFP, which it
did not.

The Arbitral Tribunal finds that the Concession Agreement supports Venezuela’s
position. This arises out of the interplay of the following contract provisions. Clause
25 of the Concession Agreement provides:

THE MINISTRY shall pay THE CONCESSIONAIRE for the additional costs
of greater amount of work by compensating it as described in Number 1,
Clause 46 hereof. [..].

Number 1 of Clause 46 then reads as follows:

THE MINISTRY shall maintain the Economic-Financial Equilibrium of the
Concession using the Mathematical Model of the Economic-Financial Plan
described in Annex A hereto, by means of payments and adjustments made
in the manner indicated in this Clause, whenever one of the following events
[...[ occurs:

47/113

166.

167.

168.

169.

170.

1. If there are additional costs due to larger amounts of work, as indicated in
Clause 25 hereof, THE MINISTRY shall compensate THE
CONCESSIONAIRE by means of Direct Payments for the equivalent of
100% of the additional costs."°
Annex A to the Concession Agreement in turn defines "Direct Payments" and
demonstrates that the "Direct Payments" are a means to maintain the Economic-
Financial Equilibrium:

‘Direct Payments’ shall mean the compensation mechanism according to
which THE MINISTRY shall pay to THE CONCESSIONAIRE, by means of a
payment order in domestic currency, the amounts required by THE
CONCESSIONAIRE from THE MINISTRY, as part of THE MINISTRY'S
obligation to maintain the Economic-Financial Equilibrium [...].
For the reasons set forth in Section 1 above, the Tribunal is of the opinion that
maintaining the Economic-Financial Equilibrium required Aucoven to submit a
revised Economic-Financial Plan. Since “Direct Payments” in compensation of
additional works are one of the means of maintaining the EFE, they must be
deemed subject to the same prerequisite.

It is undisputed that Aucoven has submitted no revised Economic-Financial Plan
taking the additional and excess works into account. As a consequence, Venezuela
cannot be regarded as being in breach of the Concession Agreement by not paying
the additional and excess works.

Obligation to exempt Aucoven from taxes

Aucoven claims that Venezuela breached Clause 27 of the Concession Agreement
by not taking the appropriate steps to make Aucoven exempt from paying the
interest tax and by not arranging for, or making its best efforts to obtain from
competent entities, an exemption from the luxury and wholesale tax. Aucoven also
contends that Venezuela breached Clause 28 by not exempting from import taxes
any equipment which Aucoven or its subcontractors would require to perform the
Concession (Cl. PHB, {I] 234-242, pp. 54-57).

Venezuela concedes that it did not grant the exemptions, but submits that the
Concession Agreement contemplated that the exemptions might not be possible and

It should be noted that Clause 46 lists a number of events and determines, for each of them, whether
compensation shall be made through "Direct Payments" or through the "Rate Increase System".

48/113

171.

172.

provided a contractual alternative for such event. The implementation of the
alternative was subject to Aucoven’s updating the EFP to account for its increased
tax costs, which it did not. Thus, “no breach-of-contract claim can rest solely on the
Republic's asserted failure to provide the tax exonerations”. According to
Venezuela, Aucoven must further show that it “sought to obtain compensation for its
additional tax costs through an updated EFP”, which "did not occur” (Ven. PHB, p.
52).

Clauses 27 and 28 provide as follows:

Clause_27: Once this Agreement has been executed, THE
NATIONAL EXECUTIVE shall take the appropriate steps to comply
with the provisions of Article 49 of the Decree having the scope and
force of Organic Law No. 138, as well as with the provisions of
Article 40 of Executive Decree No. 502, to make THE
CONCESSIONAIRE exempt from paying one hundred percent
(100%) of income tax and applicable taxes on loan principal interest,
as well as those corresponding to debt instruments issued by THE
CONCESSIONAIRE.

Likewise, in order to encourage the application of lower tolls, THE
MINISTRY shall arrange for, and make its best effort to obtain from
competent entities, an exemption for THE CONCESSIONAIRE from
paying luxury and wholesale taxes and an exemption or waiver for
THE CONCESSIONAIRE for municipal taxes. If all or part of the
exemptions or waivers described in this Clause are revoked or if they
expire before the term of the Concession does, the Economic-
Financial Equilibrium of the Concession shall be re-established in
accordance with the provisions of Clause 46, Number 9 hereof. THE
MINISTRY shall take the actions that make it possible to include
THE CONCESSIONAIRE and its operations within any existing
exemption from luxury and wholesale taxes.

Clause 28: During the term of the Concession, imports for necessary
machinery, supplies, equipment and replacement parts made by
THE CONCESSIONNAIRE and by its contractors in accomplishing
the purpose of the Concession shall be made exempt from import
taxes during the Concession term. [...]. If all or part of the
exemptions described herein are revoked or if they expire before the
Concession term does, the Economic-Financial Equilibrium of the
Concession shall be re-established in accordance with the provisions
of Clause 46, Number 9 hereof.

Both of these provisions refer to a situation of expiration or revocation of the
exemptions, in which case the Economic-Financial Equilibrium must be
reestablished in accordance with the provisions of Clause 46, Nr. 9. Such provision
stipulates that, if all or parts of the exemptions or waivers granted in accordance
with Clauses 27 or 28 are revoked, the Ministry shall compensate Aucoven by

means of the "Rate Increase System".

49/113

173.

174.

175.

176.

Accordingly, the parties had envisioned that the exemptions may expire before the
term of the Concession or may be revoked. They had provided for a specific remedy
in such cases, i.e., compensation through the "Rate Increase System". They did not
provide any rule for the event that an exemption would not be granted at all. The
Tribunal considers that, given the similarity of the resulting situation, an analogy can
be drawn between this latter event and revocation or expiration. This analogy seems
particularly apposite as the remedy is a compensation of Aucoven’s additional tax
burden, i.e., a remedy which adequately compensates a failure to procure an
exemption or a lack of best efforts expended to this end.

The consequence of the analogous application of Clauses 27 and 28 for our
purposes is twofold: the failure to obtain the exemption or to expend related best
efforts cannot be deemed a breach, whereas the failure to provide compensation
through the “Rate Increase System” may be one.

Again, the Tribunal considers that the applicability of the "Rate Increase System"
required the update of the Economic-Financial Plan. This is in particular supported
by Section 2 of Annex A to the Concession Agreement:

Once what is stated in section 1 of this Annex has been done, the
appropriate system of compensation in the Mathematical Model shall be
defined, applying to the Mathematical Model the variables corresponding to
the toll rate, term and amount of investment, together or separately, in order
to determine the applicability of the Rate Increase System or the Direct
Payments.

Section 1 of Annex A, to which the provision just quoted refers, contains the
mechanism and guidelines for updating the Economic-Financial Plan.

Mr. Martinez, testifying on behalf of Aucoven, confirmed the Tribunal’s reading,
pursuant to which the implementation of Clause 46, Nr. 9 required an update of the
Economic-Financial Plan:
Q. Isn't it true that one of the events that is specified in Clause 46, which
would require Aucoven to submit a new financial plan is found in paragraph

nine, which states that if Aucoven does not receive a waiver from taxes, the
plan shall be updated so the Ministry may compensate Aucoven?

(Witness reviews document.)
A. That is true, if the Ministry indicated and said that the intention of

compensated reimbursement, but if the Ministry decides it is impossible or it
does not want to or cannot increase the rates, it would be difficult to request

50/113,

177.

178.

179.

180.

the state to compensate for a failure if it's not indicated that the intent is to
reimburse me for that mechanism.

So, if we don't know all of the elements, sometimes it is difficult to request
the state to compensate if the future consequences are unknown (Tr. 178:
15; 179:11).
Since it is undisputed that Aucoven did not submit a revised EFP, the Tribunal
concludes that Venezuela did not commit a breach of contract by not obtaining the
exemption of taxes or by not compensating Aucoven.

Obligation to pay the Minimum Guaranteed Income

Aucoven submits that because Venezuela refused to raise the tolls, its income fell
below the minimum income guaranteed in Clause 23 of the Concession Agreement.
(‘Minimum Guaranteed Income”). In such a case, Venezuela had the obligation to
make direct payments in the amount of the difference between the actual income
and the Minimum Guaranteed Income pursuant to Clause 23. Aucoven stresses
that, each operating year, it requested the Ministry to pay this difference, but that the
Ministry never responded (Cl. PHB, If] 220-223, p. 51).

Venezuela disputes that it had a contractual obligation to make the direct payments
claimed by Aucoven. It submits that the purpose of the Minimum Guaranteed
Income was to restore the Economic-Financial Equilibrium and, hence, that it cannot
be viewed as an independent financial obligation separate and apart from the
Economic-Financial Equilibrium (Ven. PHB, p. 47).

In this respect, General Orozco testified as follows:

A. This letter gives an explanation, but | remember that the minimum
income and the tolls should be done according to the economic-financial plan
that should have been submitted and updated, and that financial plan that
should accompany at all times the rates that should be imposed. There was
always recalling of the rate, but it was not raised in the Economic-Financial
Plan.

Q. So, as a result of that reasoning, you took no steps to pay the minimum
guaranteed income?

A. No, because if there is no Economic-Financial Plan, that will tell me what
were the investments made. What were the investments done at that time.
The different economic variables that we should have, | don't say | can pay
until | get an invoice (Tr.366:17; 367:11).

51/113,

181.

182.

183.

Mr. Fernandez Lopez provided testimony of similar input:

Q. So you didn't pay the minimum guaranteed income because you thought
that Aucoven would have to update the Economic-Financial Plan before?

A. | think that, in accordance with the contract, Aucoven was in the duty to
present the new plan. The new economic and financial plan (Tr. 438:14-19).

In addition, Venezuela contends that, in any event, Aucoven was in no
circumstances entitled to payment, as any amounts paid under the Minimum
Guaranteed Income provisions would be deposited in the trust account (Ven. PHB,
p. 48; Ven. PHR, pp. 118-119). It also alleges that the Minimum Guaranteed
Income, which is “a fixed amount to which Aucoven was entitled based on the toll
rates contemplated in the initial EFP” (Ven. PHR, p. 48), would necessarily have
changed in response to changes in actual project costs and expenses as reflected in
updates of the EFP. Since Aucoven was "relieved from the responsibility for the
costs of a substantial construction project the values in the initial EFP, including the
projected toll rates used to calculate the minimum guaranteed income, were no
longer applicable” (Ven. PHR, p. 49).

Clause 23 of the Concession Agreement reads as follows:

THE MINISTRY guarantees THE CONCESSIONAIRE that it shall receive as
minimum income for tolls during each Year of Operation, an amount at least
equal to the Minimum Guaranteed Income. In the event that annual income
actually collected by THE CONCESSIONAIRE for tolls, related services and
the benefits generated by said income is less than the Minimum Guaranteed
Income, THE MINISTRY shall pay THE CONCESSIONAIRE an amount
sufficient to cover said updated deficit amount. THE MINISTRY shall issue a
document on the day the minutes are drawn up pursuant to Clause 15, letter
f) of this document, certifying the updated deficit amount. Said amount shall
be paid by THE MINISTRY to THE CONCESSIONAIRE within ten business
days of March 31 of each Year of Operation, after which the amount owed
shall accrue late interest on loan arrears as specified by Clause 26 of this
document.

LJ

Paragraph Two: The term "Minimum Guaranteed Income" shall mean that
income that THE CONCESSIONAIRE shall receive as a minimum in tolls for
both directions, equal to the amount resulting from multiplying the volume of
base vehicular traffic per category and direction determined by THE
MINISTRY for each Year of Operation, as described in Annex A hereto, by
the amount of the last rates that were in effect during the Year of Operation
in question, in accordance with the provisions hereof, corresponding to each
category of vehicle in each direction.

52/113,

184.

185.

186.

187.

188.

According to this provision, the Minimum Guaranteed Income must be determined
on the basis of two criteria:

The volume of base vehicular traffic per category and direction determined
by the Ministry for each year of operation, as described in Annex A;

The amount of the last rates that were in effect during the year of
operation.

On this issue, Mr. Martinez testified as follows:

Q. Mr. Martinez, let us talk about payments under the contract. Do you
agree that the Minimum Guaranteed Income essentially is the income
obtained by multiplying the toll rate in effect in a particular year by the
expected volume of traffic for the operating year?

A. That is correct, but | would like to clarify that is the volume of traffic that
the Ministry included in the bid in--in the bid papers, that estimate (Tr. 183:7-
17).

The determination of these criteria (volume and amount) does not require an
updated Economic-Financial Plan and Aucoven is right when it points out that there
is nothing in Annex A requiring an update of the EFP before making the payments
provided in Clause 23 (Cl. PHB, I] 224-225, pp. 51-52).

According to Annex A to the Concession Agreement, it is only in a specific situation
that the Economic-Financial Plan needs to be updated in relation to the Minimum
Guaranteed Income:

To lessen the negative impact of the macroeconomic conditions which
necessarily affect the Economic-Financial Equilibrium of the Concession,
when [...] the amount collected by THE CONCESSIONAIRE in tolls during a
six-months period is less than twenty five percent (25%) of the prorated
portion of the Guaranteed Minimum Income for that period of six (6) months,
THE CONCESSIONAIRE shall update the Economic-Financial Plan taking
into account the new situation and shall submit it to THE MINISTRY for its
analysis. Fifteen (15) continuous days after THE CONCESSIONAIRE
submits the updated Economic-Financial Plan, there shall be an automatic
temporary increase in the effective toll rates [...].

This provision confirms that there is no obligation to update the Economic-Financial
Plan in other circumstances in order to trigger Venezuela's obligation to pay the
Minimum Guaranteed Income on the basis of Clause 23. Therefore, Venezuela had

53/113,

189.

190.

191.

192.

193.

a contractual obligation to make these payments, even though Aucoven did not
submit a revised Economic-Financial Plan.

As a consequence, by refusing to pay Aucoven the Minimum Guaranteed Income,
Venezuela breached Clause 23 of the Concession Agreement.

Venezuela's additional argument that the amount of the Minimum Guaranteed
Income should not have been paid to Aucoven, but instead deposited in the trust
account does not modify the Tribunal’s conclusion, as it is not disputed that
Venezuela did not make any deposit in the trust account corresponding to the
Minimum Guaranteed Income either.

Obligation to approve the trust agreement

Aucoven submits that Venezuela breached Clauses 6 and 40 of the Concession
Agreement by failing to approve the trust agreement submitted to the Ministry, as
the latter did not provide any substantive comments for almost a year. This breach
deprived Aucoven of access to the toll income it earned for the first eighteen months
of the Concession. In particular, Aucoven claims that Venezuela did not comply with
its obligation to submit written comments within fifteen days from Aucoven’s request.
After it finally furnished comments, Venezuela failed to expeditiously negotiate the
finalization of the trust agreement. Furthermore, since the Ministry failed to respond
to Aucoven’s repeated requests for approval of the trust agreement, Aucoven
argues that it was entitled to construe the draft submitted on March 28, 1997 as
having been approved (Cl. PHB, {If 142, p. 30 and 236-238, p. 56).

Venezuela disputes the Claimant's position and submits that it could not approve the
trust agreement, because the provisions of the draft provided by Aucoven failed to
meet entirely legitimate public interest requirements of Venezuela, including
requirements expressly stated in the bidding documents. In addition, Venezuela
alleges that the parties discussed the draft submitted by Aucoven during meetings
between the Ministry and the Claimant (Ven. PHB, pp. 45-46; Ven PHR, pp. 121-
123).

Clause 6(1) of the Concession Agreement provides for the parties’ obligation to
promptly respond to each other:

It is imperative that the parties respond promptly to requests made of

each other in connection with the matters having a direct bearing on

the Economic-Financial Equilibrium or the schedule for work to be
performed according to Annex C.

54/113,

194.

195.

196.

And further:

Therefore, THE MINISTRY shall respond in writing to requests that

THE CONCESSIONAIRE may make within fifteen (15) business

days from the date they are submitted. In the event that THE

MINISTRY does not respond within the aforementioned time limit,

the request shall be construed as having been approved, unless the

law expressly requires a prior pronouncement.
Clause 40 of the Concession Agreement, to which Aucoven further refers in support
of its claim, governs the creation of the trust account. In its first paragraph, it
stipulates that Aucoven must submit a draft trust agreement for Venezuela's

approval.

It is undisputed that Aucoven submitted a draft trust agreement to Venezuela on
March 28, 1997. It is also undisputed that Venezuela did not approve this trust
agreement, nor respond in writing to its submission. General Orozco testified that
the draft trust agreement was not approved, because its terms were not in
conformity with those initially contemplated, in particular because “Aucoven wanted
to be the only one to manage the trust fund, [...] whereas the Ministry had the
responsibility to control those funds which were public monies [...]“ (Tr. 372:14-19).
The same witness further stated that the draft agreement was discussed on several
occasions during meetings held between Aucoven and the Ministry:

Q. The trust fund wasn't set up until the following year after you left the
administration; correct?

A. That's right. It was not set up until after | left my position because it was
not set up as it had been initially drafted. So, Aucoven wanted to be the only
one to manage the trust fund, and so it was opposed to some of the
administrative expenses, whereas the Ministry had the responsibility to
control those funds which were public monies which had been collected from
the fund (Tr. 372:9-20). [...]

And we discussed how that trust fund would allow for participation of
the Ministry in order to exercise control. [...] (Tr. 373:2).

A comparison between the bid documents and the draft trust agreement shows that
the latter indeed differed in material terms. Specifically, the bidding documents
expressly provided that “[t]he trust fund shall be operated jointly in all cases...” (Ven.
Ex. 6). Hence, the Tribunal cannot follow Aucoven’s contention that Venezuela
breached the Concession Agreement by failing to approve a document that did not
meet the parameters agreed. It remains to be seen whether Venezuela breached

55/113,

197.

198.

199.

200.

the Agreement by failing to comment on the draft trust agreement, including by

failing to provide a written response within fifteen days.

It is established that the parties had almost daily contacts at the time. This is in
particular evidenced by the testimony of Mr. Perez Alfonzo, the President of
Aucoven:

Q: And as you testified in your statement, you talked nearly every

day with Minister Orozco; isn’t that correct?

A: Correct.

Q: And even though he was the Minister of a ministry with wide-
ranging responsibilities and matters under its control, he usually took
your calls, didn’t he?

A: Correct.

Q: And if you could not get in touch with him on any given occasion,
isn’t it true that you could usually talk to his staff who were working
on the Concession?

A: Correct (Tr. 219:12-220:4).

Under these circumstances, the Tribunal finds it implausible that the parties did not
discuss the draft trust agreement and that Venezuela did not raise the deficiencies
of the draft. It is true that these were oral contacts only and that Clause 6(1)
provides for written responses. However, it is clear from the wording of Clause 6(1)
that the requirement for a written response within fifteen days merely serves the
purpose of ensuring that responses are effectively given promptly. Since that
purpose was indeed met here and since Aucoven could not have ignored the non-
conformity of the draft, it would be excessively formalistic to find a breach on the
basis of the lack of a writing as a stand-alone requirement. The Tribunal cannot
discern a breach in the alleged failure to expeditiously negotiate a final trust
agreement either, as it was Aucoven’s duty to furnish a version in compliance with
the requirements of the bidding documents. It results from the foregoing
developments that Aucoven was not entitled to treat the draft trust agreement as

approved pursuant to Clause 6(1) in fine.

Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Venezuela did not breach Clause 6 and 40 of
the Concession Agreement in connection with the trust agreement.
Obligation to resort exclusively to arbitration

Aucoven submits that Venezuela breached the arbitration agreement embodied in
Clause 64 of the Concession Agreement by initiating proceedings seeking a
declaration of termination of the Concession Agreement before the Venezuelan

56/113,

201.

202.

203.

204.

205.

Supreme Court of Justice. According to the Claimant, any dispute on the validity of
Aucoven's termination had to be submitted to this Tribunal (Cl. PHB, I] 258-261; Cl.
PHR, 163, p. 17).

Venezuela disputes the Claimant's position and contends that its decision to seek a
declaration of termination by the Venezuelan Supreme Court cannot represent a
breach of contract, because the law expressly governing the Concession
Agreement, Decree Law Nr. 138, reserves any issues related to termination of the
Concession Agreement to the Venezuelan courts (Ven. PHR, p. 126; Ven.
Rejoinder, pp. 52-53).

The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it in this
arbitration. This has been affirmed in this Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction of
September 27, 2001. Neither Clause 64, which refers to “[a]ny dispute, claim,
controversy, disagreement and/or difference related to, derived from, or in
connection with the Concession or on any manner related to the interpretation,
performance, nonfulfillment, termination or resolution of the same”, nor the
Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction, which declares that “[t}he Arbitral Tribunal has
jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it in this arbitration” limit this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction in any manner. Hence it can only be understood as encompassing
issues of termination.

According to a general principle of procedure applicable in municipal court
proceedings as well as in arbitration, any court or tribunal has Kompetenz-
Kompetenz, i.e., jurisdiction to decide over its own jurisdiction. Therefore, it is not up
to this Tribunal to make a determination about the Venezuelan Supreme Court's

alleged jurisdiction over issues of termination of the Concession Agreement.

This being so, the arbitration agreement in Clause 64, on which this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction is founded, is an exclusive one in the sense that it submits “all” disputes
arising out of the Concession Agreement to ICSID arbitration. It even specifies that
“[e]lach of the parties waives any present of future rights to initiate or maintain any
lawsuit or legal proceeding with respect to any controversy until the latter has been
resolved according to the aforementioned arbitration proceeding, and then only in
order to enforce the award or decision rendered in said arbitration proceeding”.

By entering into such an exclusive arbitration agreement, both parties have
accepted to refrain from proceeding before a court which is not the one jointly
entrusted with the resolution of the dispute. As long as jurisdiction is challenged and

"

not decided upon, an argument may be made that a party has a right to proceed
elsewhere. However, that argument cannot be maintained after a decision affirming
jurisdiction was issued. In the present case, the proceedings before the Supreme
Court were initiated after the Decision on Jurisdiction had been rendered.

The fact that Article 10 of Decree Law Nr. 138, which governs the Concession
Agreement by virtue of the parties’ choice of law, appears to reserve matters related
to termination to the Venezuelan courts does not modify the position. In his
supplemental opinion, Prof. Badell observed that Clause 64 of the Agreement
appeared to submit the issue of termination or resolution to ICSID. He then stated
that the “enforceability of such a provision is questionable under Venezuelan law”
and that he had “not attempted in this respect to provide a definitive answer to this
question (Badell Supp. {| 76 at 42-43). At the hearing, he then admitted that “the
competent jurisdictional entity” to decide termination may be an arbitral tribunal if the
parties had consented to arbitration (Tr. 729:11-18).""

Further, it is a well settled principle of international law that a state cannot rely on a
provision of its domestic law to defeat its consent to arbitration (Schreuer, referred to
above, Nr 95 ad Article 42 and ref.). It is further a well accepted practice that the
national law governing by virtue of a choice of law agreement (pursuant to Article
42(1) first sentence of the ICSID Convention) is subject to correction by international
law in the same manner as the application of the host state law failing an agreement
(under the second sentence of the same treaty provision) (Schreuer, referred to
above, Nrs. 62-70, ad Article 42 and ref., in particular Nr. 70). As a result,
Venezuela’s defense based on national law is no bar to Aucoven’s claim of a breach
of Clause 64.

Thus, the Tribunal, emphasizing that it makes no determination over the jurisdiction
of the Venezuelan courts, but limits itself to applying the provision of the Concession
Agreement, holds that Venezuela breached Clause 64.

Obligation to act in good faith

Aucoven submits that Venezuela’s failure to raise the toll rates, to pay Aucoven the
Minimum Guaranteed Income, to promptly issue the guarantee, to compensate

Prof. Badell accepted this proposition by reference to a quotation of Miguel Marienhoff, Administrative Law,
appearing at paragraph 63 of his supplemental report pursuant to which a contractor to an administrative
contract must petition the “competent jurisdictional entity” for a declaration of termination.

58/113,

210.

211.

212.

215.

Aucoven for additional work and excess work, to cooperate in issuing permits,
granting tax exemptions, obtaining financing, and establishing the trust fund, and to
maintain the Economic-Financial Equilibrium constitute each by itself, and taken as
a whole, a breach of Venezuela’s obligation to perform the Concession Agreement
in good faith. Moreover, the Claimant contends that Venezuela's challenges to the
validity of the Concession Agreement further underscore the Respondent's lack of
good faith (in particular, Cl. PHB, I] 263-265, p. 62).

Venezuela disputes the Claimant's position (in particular, Ven. PHR, pp. 127-128). It
stresses that Aucoven has dropped its initial allegations of “gross neglect” and
“willfully hostile acts”. It further alleges that there is no legal foundation to assert that
a breach of contract is “by itself’ a breach of good faith and that the legal
proceedings brought by the Ministry were proper under Venezuelan law.

The Arbitral Tribunal notes that, subject to the claim in connection with the
administrative challenges, all the elements cited by Aucoven as evidence of
Venezuela's bad faith have been raised as breaches of the Concession Agreement.
These elements have been examined above in that latter context. The Arbitral
Tribunal has decided for each of these elements whether or not they constituted a
breach of contract.

The Tribunal notes, moreover, that Aucoven claims reimbursement of expenses
generated by the administrative challenges and that, to the extent that Venezuela is
responsible for such challenges, it is awarded reimbursement (see Section G.3.5
below).

Taking these considerations into account, the Arbitral Tribunal can see no legal
foundation to find a breach of good faith. In addition, the witness evidence rendered
by both parties shows cooperation and genuine efforts by government officials to
resolve the difficulties (see in particular the testimony of Mr. Perez Alfonzo,
President of Aucoven, Tr. 219:12-220;16).

Conclusion

On the basis of the elements developed above, the Tribunal holds that Venezuela
has breached the obligations to pay the Minimum Guaranteed Income and to resort
exclusively to arbitration under Clause 64.

In coming to this conclusion, the Tribunal emphasizes that it ruled on the additional
breaches for the reason that Aucoven requested declaratory relief in this respect.

220.

However, Aucoven did not raise separate damage claims based on these breaches.
Therefore, having already ruled that Venezuela breached its contractual obligations
to raise the tolls and deliver the guarantee, the Tribunal can dispense with
determining whether the additional breaches reviewed in this section allowed
Aucoven to terminate the Agreement and/or to claim damages.

Dip AUCOVEN VALIDLY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT?

Aucoven asks the Tribunal to declare that it was entitled to terminate the
Concession Agreement pursuant to Clause 60(2) and principles of international law
on grounds of (a) Venezuela’s breaches and (b) Venezuela’s failure to perform

conditions precedent.

Clause 60(2) provides the following in respect of termination by the Concessionaire:

Without prejudice to the provisions of this document, in the event of
nonftulfillment of any of the obligations undertaken in this Agreement
by or through the MINISTRY... the CONCESSIONAIRE may
terminate this Agreement without prejudice to exercising any other
rights and actions that might correspond to it, in which case the
Concession shall be terminated, ....

Was Aucoven entitled to terminate the Agreement unilaterally?

The parties’ positions

Relying upon its legal expert, Aucoven asserts that Clause 60(2) of the Concession
Agreement constitutes an “express resolutory clause” that must be upheld under

Venezuelan law, including Decree Law Nr. 138.

Venezuela objects that Clause 60 does not afford Aucoven the right to exercise a
self-proclaimed unilateral termination. Venezuela does not entirely dispute
“Aucoven’s right under Clause 60 of the Contract to terminate the Contract”. Instead,
it argues that “Venezuelan law and the Contract itself permit Aucoven to terminate
the Contract in appropriate circumstances, but only in accordance with the terms of
the Contract and Decree Law No. 138, i.e., by applying to the appropriate tribunal
for an order approving such termination at Aucoven’s request” (Ven. PHR, p. 139).

The contractual framework

From a contractual point of view, the question boils down to the following: does the
terms “THE CONCESSIONAIRE may terminate this agreement” in Clause 60(2) of
the Agreement mean that the Concessionaire may unilaterally terminate the

60/113

221.

1.3

222.

223.

Agreement without resorting to the tribunal allegedly competent under Venezuelan
administrative law?

The Tribunal agrees with Venezuela that this is not “stat[ed] in so many words” in
Clause 60(2). However, a reasonable interpretation of this wording leads to the
conclusion that the Concessionaire can unilaterally terminate the Concession
Agreement. This is a classic provision in long term contracts. There is no indication
on record that could lead the Tribunal to believe that the parties’ intent in drafting
Clause 60 was not to provide for an ordinary resolution clause. Had the parties
really intended to subject the termination of the Agreement to a ruling by a judicial
body, they would have expressly referred to such requirement in Clause 60(2).
Hence, the Tribunal finds that Clause 60(2) entitled Aucoven to terminate the
Concession Agreement by a unilateral notice.

The impact of Venezuelan law

In reaching the conclusion that Clause 60 allows the Concessionaire to terminate
the Agreement by way of a unilateral notice, the Tribunal emphasizes that it focused
on the reasonably determinable intentions of the parties. Accordingly, the Tribunal’s
approach departs from Venezuela’s contention that “Clause 60 should be
interpreted consistently with the position, which Dr. Badell has repeatedly stated,
that unilateral termination is not permitted under Venezuelan administrative law”
(Ven PHR, pp. 138-139 referring to Badell Op. J] 63-69, Badell Supp. | 61-72). This
does not mean that it does not consider Venezuelan law. However, it finds that the
relevant question is rather whether the contractually agreed right to exercise a self-
proclaimed unilateral termination is enforceable under Venezuelan law.

Relying on the evidence tendered by its legal expert, Venezuela alleges that “under
Venezuelan law termination of an administrative contract at the request of the non-
State party requires a formal application to the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of
Venezuela, which considers public-interest factors in determining whether, and
under what circumstances, an administrative contract may be terminated” (Ven.
PHB, p. 63 referring to Badell |, ] 68). Venezuela’s argument is founded on the
decision of the Venezuelan Supreme Court in the matter of Accién Comercial,
which, Venezuela argues, “establishes that, unlike commercial contracts,
administrative contracts may not be terminated by a private party without judicial
involvement” (Ven. PHB, p. 63 referring to CSJ/SPA, 06.14.1983, Accién
Commercial, S.A., reprinted in Ortiz-Alvarez, Luis and Mascetti, Giovanna,

61/113

227.

12

Jurisprudencia de Contratos Administrativos (1980-1999) [Jurisprudence of
Administrative Contracts] (Caracas, 1999), Badell Auth. 32, at 81).

Aucoven contends that the Venezuelan Supreme Court's decision in Accién
Comercial does not so hold, but “simply stat[es] the remedies that are open to a
contractor when the Administration unilaterally terminates for a cause not
attributable to the contractor” (CI. PHR, {| 69). In support of this contention, Aucoven
submits the full quotation of the passage of the Accién Comercial decision referred
to by Venezuela:

[T]he administrative contract authorizes the contracting

Administration to terminate it unilaterally, judging the breach of the

private party that signed the contract, who in any event has open the

way of the courts to obtain, in a debate before the judge with

jurisdiction, the preservation of the economic equation of the

contract, if the cause of the termination is not attributable to it. [...]

(Badell, Auth. 32, at 81).
As the legal expert of Venezuela himself admitted on cross-examination, the
Tribunal finds that Accién Comercial does not address the question of unilateral
termination by the non-State party. The Tribunal is not convinced by Venezuela’s
argument as to the non-enforceability of a contractually agreed unilateral termination
right by the non-State party.

But even if one were to accept that Venezuelan law requires that the termination of
an administrative contract by the non-State party be sought before Venezuelan
courts, this principle is not absolute. Indeed, the Tribunal notes that Venezuela does
not really contest Dr. Ortiz’s testimony that unilateral termination by the non-State
party is possible, in particular in case of economic strangulation.’? Since it may
suffer some exception, the principle invoked by Venezuela cannot be deemed an
absolute one. If economic strangulation may generally represent an exception to the
principle, the same must be true for a particular contractual clause providing for
unilateral termination for specific important reasons.

In conclusion, the Tribunal holds that Clause 60 of the Agreement constitutes a
unilateral resolutory clause which is not inconsistent with mandatory provisions of

Venezuelan law.

Ven. PHR, p. 137, in which Venezuela emphasized that economic strangulation “does not exist in this
case”.

Were the conditions for unilateral termination met?

The next issue is whether the conditions for unilateral termination set forth in Clause
60 of the Agreement were fulfilled. In other words, the issue is whether Aucoven
was actually entitled to exercise the termination right provided in Clause 60 of the
Agreement. Clause 60 sets forth the following conditions: (a) a breach of an
obligation provided in the Agreement by or through the Ministry, (b) a notification of
the breach by Aucoven, and (c) the non-rectification of the breach by the Ministry
within twenty business days.

The Tribunal has already held that Venezuela breached the Concession Agreement
by failing to raise the tolls as provided in Clause 31 (Chapter IV.C above). Thus, the
first condition referring to a breach is fulfilled. It remains to be seen whether the two
other conditions are equally met.

In this respect, Aucoven’s letter of June 13, 2000 to the Ministry reads as follows:

.... On various opportunities, Aucoven notified the Ministry about the
breach of certain obligations undertaken by the Republic under the
Concession Agreement, in order to request voluntary performance of
such obligations.

Accordingly, on September 18 and 19; and November 24, 1997;
February 18, May 18, July 14 and October 8, 1998; January 26 and
28, March 4 and July 13, 1999; and February 14, 2000, Aucoven
asked the Ministry in writing to adjust the toll rates for the Caracas-
La Guaira Highway, pursuant to the agreement expressly made by
the parties in Clauses 31 and 32 of the Concession Agreement.
However, the Ministry has still not remedied its breach by
appropriately adjusting the aforementioned toll rates.

Likewise, on September 19, 1997, September 14, 1998 and
September 20, 1999, Aucoven informed the Ministry of the amounts
corresponding to the shortfall in the updated Guaranteed Minimum
Revenues (along with the applicable late interest), for the Years of
Operations ended August 31, 1997 and 1998 and March 31, 1999,
which the Republic had the obligation to pay to Aucoven pursuant to
Clause 26 of the Concession Agreement. However, the Ministry has
not paid Aucoven the aforementioned amounts.

Due to all of the foregoing, by means of this letter:

1. We inform the Ministry of Aucoven’s decision to terminate the
Concession Agreement, under the right granted to the parties in
Clause 60 [...], we would (also) like to inform you that Aucoven is
willing to continue performing in good faith the routine maintenance
and toll collection activities described in the Concession Agreement,
with the understanding that the execution of such activities in good
faith must not in any way affect the termination of the
aforementioned Concession Agreement.

63/113

231.

232.

233.

234.

235.

Venezuela does not deny that Aucoven’s letters asking the Ministry to adjust the toll
rates represent notices of breach within the meaning of Clause 60 of the Agreement
and that the contractually agreed toll increase was not implemented within twenty
business days thereafter. Thus, the Tribunal concludes that, like the first one, the
last two conditions for the unilateral termination set forth in Clause 60 of the
Agreement were fulfilled. Hence, Aucoven validly terminated the Agreement

pursuant to Clause 60.

Was the termination a legal fiction?

Venezuela’s last argument in support of the invalidity of the termination is that
“Aucoven’s claim that it had already terminated the Contract on June 13, 2000, [...]
is a legal fiction intended to improve Aucoven’s legal posture for the present
proceeding” (Ven. PHB, p. 61). In other words, “the facts of Aucoven’s conduct
simply do not square with its alleged legal argument” (Ven. PHB, p. 115). It is true
that Aucoven’s letter purporting to terminate the Contract on June 13, 2000 appears
to have been drafted by Aucoven’s arbitration counsel (Tr. 204:2-6). It is further
correct that little or nothing changed in the relationship between the parties as a
consequence of the termination letter. In fact, as conceded by Aucoven’s technical
manager, Mr. Martinez, Aucoven carried out “the same activity” after June 13, 2000
as it had prior to June 13, 2000 (Tr. 201:11; 202:7).

However, these facts do not modify the legal position discussed in the foregoing
sections. Aucoven’s termination was valid both under the Agreement and under
Venezuelan law. The Tribunal is not convinced that the mere fact that the parties
continued their relationship after the termination is in and of itself sufficient to
invalidate the termination. In reality, it may even speak in favor of Aucoven that it did
not cease performing immediately but continued to cooperate, which was certainly
also in the best interest of Venezuela. The situation would be different had
Venezuela established that the termination was abusive or otherwise contrary to
good faith, which it did not.

Conclusion

On the basis of the foregoing developments, the Tribunal concludes that Aucoven
validly terminated the Agreement on June 13, 2000.

Aucoven’s main submission is that Clause 60(2) of the Agreement explicitly entitles
it to recover all its damages in the event of a valid termination by Aucoven (Cl. PHR,

64/113

236.

237.

238.

239.

q 75). In the following sections, the Tribunal will now turn to the issues related to
damages, namely (1) Aucoven’s claim for out-of-pocket expenses, and (2)
Aucoven’s claim for lost profits, as well as (3) interest.

OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES

The legal basis of the claim and the scope of the out-of-pocket
expenses to which Aucoven is entitled

The parties agree that Aucoven is entitled to recover its out-of-pocket expenses in
accordance with Clause 60(2) of the Agreement (Cl. PHR, {| 269; Ven. PHB, p. 70).
They construe this provision differently, however, when it comes to the scope of

recoverable expenses.

Clause 60(2) provides, that, in the event of a termination by the Concessionaire, “the
MINISTRY shall compensate and indemnify the CONCESSIONAIRE, pursuant to
the same terms stipulated [...] for early repossession”, namely:

(i) the fair value of the assets and works [...];

(ii) the amounts corresponding to other assets allocated to the
Concession [...];

(iii) the current value of other assets related to the Concession or
the fulfillment of this Agreement that are different from the
Allocated Assets{...];

(iv) all other updated costs and expenses pursuant to the terms of
this Concession{...];

(

=

all losses or damages, including lost profits and damnum
emergens.

Aucoven alleges that “standing alone, Clause 60(2)(v), which entitles Aucoven to
receive ‘all losses or damages’, provides an ample basis to award all of the out-of-
pocket expenses that Aucoven claims” (Cl. PHB, | 461, p. 118). In reliance upon
Clause 60(2)(iv) of the Agreement, which entitles the Concessionaire to recover the
“costs and expenses pursuant to the terms of this Concession including interest and
investment expenses”, Venezuela objects that Aucoven is entitled only to out-of
pocket costs “incurred pursuant to the terms of the Agreement” (Ven. PHR, p. 70,
emphasis added in the brief).

The Tribunal concurs with Venezuela’s view that under Clause 60(2)(iv), Aucoven is
entitled only to out-of-pocket costs pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.
However, the Tribunal finds that, from a systematic point of view, Clause 60(2)(v) is
separate from Clause 60(2)(iv) and provides an independent basis for claims. This is

65/113

240.

241.

242.

243.

not an attempt “to obscure the dispositive impact of the requirement [of Clause
60(2)(iv)]” (Ven. PHR, p. 70), but rather a reading giving proper consideration to the
dispositive language of Clause 60(2)(v).

According to the plain text of Clause 60(2)(v), it is undeniable that out-of-pocket
damages are not limited to those incurred pursuant to the Agreement. Venezuela’s
contention in this respect reads as follows:

Although Clause 60(2)(v) reflects the possibility that Aucoven may

claim recovery of all “losses or damages, including ...”, Aucoven has

cited no authority and has not otherwise offered any legitimate

argument how the provision would allow Aucoven to claim damages

are unrelated to the Concession contract [...].(Ven. PHR, p.
In other words, Venezuela seems to accept that Clause 60(2)(v) provides a basis for
Aucoven’s out-of-pocket claim, but contends that Clause 60(2)(v) does not refer to
expenses unrelated to the Agreement. In the Tribunal’s view, this allegation is
difficult to square with the plain wording of Clause 60(2)(v): would the drafters of the
Agreement have meant Clause 60(2)(v) to refer only to claims related to the
Agreement, they would have expressly provided for such a limitation exactly as they
did in Clause 60(2)(iv). Venezuela did not offer any explanation for this difference in
wording between the two Sections. The only reasonable interpretation of Clause
60(2) is that under Clause 60(2)(v) the Concessionaire is entitled to recover “all
losses or damages” beyond the “costs and expenses pursuant to the terms of [the
Agreement|’, to which it is entitled to under Clause 60(2)(iv).

The Tribunal notes that Venezuela’s arguments about the scope of allowable out-of-
pocket damages are all based on the assumption that only the costs allowed by the
relevant administrative contract are recoverable. As a matter of fact, however, the
Agreement explicitly provides that “all losses or damages” are recoverable.
Venezuela relies on “Dr. Badell testimony that, under Venezuelan law, recoverable
costs are limited to those costs allowed by the relevant administrative contract
Badell |. | 97” (Ven PHR, p. 70). Such passage merely means that out-of-pocket
expenses should be confined to those allowable under the terms of the contract
because “in this case, the contract generally defines allowable costs”, without
reference to any provision of Venezuelan law (Badell Op. {| 96).

For all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that, as a matter of principle, Clause
60(2)(v) provides a sufficient contractual basis for Aucoven to claim out-of-pocket

expenses.

66/113

244.

245.

246.

247.

248.

However this does not mean that Aucoven is entitled to recover all the amounts it
claims as out-of-pocket expenses. The next issue to be addressed is whether the
different elements of Aucoven’s claim for out-of-pocket expenses are actually due.
Before turning to the actual amounts, the Tribunal needs to address a more general
issue, namely whether the financial statements offered by Aucoven represent a valid
basis for the assessment of out-of-pocket disputes.

The accounting basis of Aucoven’s out-of-pocket costs

Aucoven uses its financial statements to calculate the out-of-pocket costs it incurred
(Cl. PHR, {] 270). Venezuela never disputed that the financial statements as such

are an appropriate basis for the calculation of out-of pocket expenses.

However, Venezuela challenges the reliability of Aucoven’s financial statements.
This issue was debated at the hearing. Insisting on the fact that its financial
statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche and on the opinion of its
financial expert (Lakshmanan II {J 47-51), Aucoven submits that all revenues and
costs on the financial statements properly reflect the revenues and costs for its work
on the Concession.

At the hearing, the Tribunal’s attention was drawn to some errors in Aucoven’s
financial statements. It will take these errors into account when assessing the
amount of out-of-pocket expenses to which Aucoven is entitled. However, it
considers that such errors do not represent a sufficient reason to entirely discard
Aucoven’s financial statements as proper evidence.

It should be emphasized that Venezuela did not challenge the reliability of
Aucoven’s financial statement until the filing of its Rejoinder only “four weeks before
the start of the hearings” (Cl. PHR, {| 463, fn. 25). Irrespective of the timeliness of
Venezuela’s argument, the Tribunal considers that the financial statements on
record should not be disregarded. In fact, the very reason why financial statements
are audited is to verify their reliability. Hence, in the Tribunal’s view, audited financial
statements benefit from a prima facie presumption of reliability. In the case at hand,
Venezuela's criticism of the reliability of the financial statements does not provide
sufficient elements to rebut that presumption. Hence, subject to rectifying the errors
mentioned above, the Tribunal will rely on the financial statements on record in
order to establish the amount of out-of-pocket costs owing to Aucoven.

67/113

249.

250.

The amounts which Aucoven is entitled to recover as out-of-pocket
expenses

Aucoven’s last claim for out-of-pocket expenses, before interest, totals
Bs. 3,253,548,000" (Cl. PHR, {| 268 and Table 2B; Annex 4 to PHR), reduced from
Bs. 3,394,266,000 (Cl. PHB p. 117). In the last claim, the amounts for pre-
termination losses and assets are unchanged; the figure for post-termination assets
is reduced; and the amount for post-termination losses is increased from Bs.
191,368,000 to Bs. 394,848,000. The increase is primarily due to an additional
amount of approximately Bs. 234 million, which is discussed in Subsection 3.1
below and is dismissed. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that
Venezuela had a proper opportunity to present its defense with respect to the out-of-
pocket expenses as no elements of claims put forward in Aucoven’s Post-Hearing
Brief are considered. It relies upon the principle that Aucoven is entitled to all of its
costs under Clause 60(2)(e) of the Agreement.

Venezuela emphasizes the fact that this approach allows for costs regardless of
their character or origin and irrespective of specific limitations arising from the terms
of the Agreement, the bidding documents and Venezuelan law. If out-of-pocket
costs are properly calculated, based on the categories of costs and investment
allowed under the Concession Agreement, Aucoven’s claim for out-of-pocket costs
cannot exceed Bs. 1.3 billion in amount (Ven. Rejoinder, p. 8). In its post-hearing
submissions, Venezuela further reduced such amount to Bs. 1,181,504,930" at
most. In fact, if one subtracts the different amounts contested by Venezuela from the
last amount claimed by Aucoven, one reaches an amount of Bs. 806,653,930 in out-
of-pocket costs which Venezuela is ready to pay."®

This claim comprises the following main elements: (a) Pre-termination Losses Incurred [through 31.3.2000]
for Bs. 118,722,000; (b) Pre-termination Assets Contributed [through 31.5.2000] for Bs. 2,398,561,000; (c)
Post-termination Losses Incurred [from 1.4.2000 to 31.8.2002] for Bs. 394,848,000; (d) Post-termination
Assets Contributed [from 1.6.2000 to 31.8.2002] for Bs. 341,417,000.

This amount “does not include Aucoven’s claim for an additional Bs. 234.1 million” (Ven PHB, p. 105, Fn
80). It is based on Aucoven’s final claim figure. This explains the difference with the amount calculated by
the Tribunal.

This amount is obtained subtracting from Bs. 3,253,548,000 (Aucoven's last claim), the following amounts:
Bs. 384,493,000 [which Venezuela lists as 384,100,000] (alleged errors), Bs. 290,000,000 (contested
negotiation costs), Bs. 510,000,000 (contested SECONSA loan), Bs. 235,800,000 (contested legal fees),
Bs. 258,841,070 (contested studies), Bs. 150,000,000 (contested administration costs) [as Venezuela did
in its calculations leading to its accepted amount], Bs. 234,160,000 [which Venezuela lists as Bs. 234.1
million] (additional costs discussed in Section IV.G.3.1), and Bs. 383,000,000 (interest costs).

In this Section, the Tribunal will examine the amounts disputed by Venezuela and
will decide for each one whether it is due or not. If it is due, it will be added to the

total conceded by Venezuela.
Out-of-pocket expenses not based on Aucoven’s financial statements

Venezuela claims that for some elements of the out-of-pocket expenses claims,
Aucoven does not provide any supporting documents, i.e., no financial statements
nor any other proof that Aucoven actually incurred these costs. Accordingly, the
following amounts should be deducted from the total amount claimed by Aucoven:

e Bs. 197,400,000 in out-of-pocket resulting from a loss update for the
operating years through to August 31, 2002; and

e Bs. 36,800,000 [recte: Bs. 36,760,000] alleged net assets contributed as of
August 31, 2002.

As to the first disputed amount, (i.e., Bs. 197,400,000), the Tribunal notes that
Appendix 6 to Cl. PHB clearly shows that this amount offsets another category of
out-of-pocket damages, namely “post resolution assets contribution” (Appendix 6 to
Cl. PHB, note 3). Hence, despite the legitimate concerns of Venezuela as to the lack
of supporting information in this respect, the update at hand is not relevant for the
determination of the total amount of out-of-pocket.

By way of contrast, the “net asset contributed as of August 31, 2002, resulting in an
increase of damage of [Bs.] 36,760[,000]” is an actual increase of Aucoven’s out-of-
pocket claim (Appendix 6 to Cl. PHB, note 4). As such, it is up to Aucoven to
establish the existence and the amount of the increased claim. The Tribunal cannot
simply derive the existence of the claim from Appendix 6 to Claimant’s Post-Hearing
Brief. Considering that Aucoven did not explain this increase in such brief, the
Tribunal concludes that Aucoven did not satisfy the burden of proving the damage it
incurred. Hence, Venezuela’s objection to Aucoven’s latest increase of Bs.
36,760,000 in the net assets contributed as of August 31, 2002 is well-founded.

Accordingly, Bs. 197,400,000 shall be added to the amount that Venezuela has
agreed constitutes legitimate out-of-pocket costs.

Error rectifications

Venezuela also claims that the total amount of the out-of-pocket expenses to which
Aucoven is entitled must be reduced to take into account some errors in Aucoven’s

expert analysis, specifically:

e an error of Bs. 363,374,000 in Aucoven’s favor by using a September 2001
CPI index to convert May 2002 figures to 1995 bolivars (Tr. 808:18; 809:11
(Lakshmanan)); and

e a CPI conversion mistake of Bs. 21,119,000 in Aucoven’s favor using the
average of CPI rates rather than the year-end CPI index (Tr. 1237:17;
1238:21 (Lakshmanan)).

Aucoven replies that both errors have been adjusted and are already reflected in
Aucoven’s last out-of-pocket claim of Bs. 3,253,548,000 resulting from revised
Exhibit 3 (Cl. PHB, ] 463, note 25, | 501, note 26; Lakshmanan rev. Ex. 3, notes 1,
809:11), and which is attached
as Appendix 6 to Aucoven’s Post-Hearing Brief. This view is confirmed by an

 

3, 4), which was presented at the hearing (Tr. 807:

analysis of Appendix 6:

e As to the first conversion error, note 4 clearly states that the reported
amounts included a correction “for the error of using the September 2001
CPI instead of the May 2002 CPI... [that] resulted in a decrease of damages
of 363.374[,000] bolivars”.

e With regard to the second conversion error, note 1 states that the reported
amount has been calculated “using the Year End CPI Index... [which]
decreased the net loss through March 31, 2000 by 9,665[,000] bolivars”.
Similarly, note 3 indicates that the calculations leading to the reported
amount “use[d] the Year End CPI Index, which resulted in a decrease of
damage of 11,454,000] bolivars”. This means that Aucoven reduced its out-
of-pocket claim by Bs 21,119,000 to take into account the average CPI rates
rather than the year-end CPI index.

To summarize, Aucoven reduced its out-of-pocket claim by Bs. 384,493,000 (i.e.,
Bs. 363,374,000 + Bs. 21,119,000), which represents exactly® the amount disputed
by Venezuela. Hence, the Tribunal will deny Venezuela’s request to decrease
Aucoven’s claim for out-of-pocket costs for errors in inflation-adjustments and,
accordingly, add Bs. 384,493,000 to the amount which Venezuela has admitted.

Bidding and negotiation costs

Venezuela further contends that Aucoven’s claim for Bs. 290 million (US$ 1.7
million)"’ for bidding and negotiation costs, should be rejected because this category
of costs is not recoverable. In support of this contention, Venezuela argues that “the
Contract, the Bidding Documents and Venezuelan law all preclude the recovery of
bidding and negotiation costs”. While Aucoven seems to agree that bidding costs
are not recoverable, it maintains that negotiation costs are recoverable.

With regard to bidding costs, Aucoven’s position is that its out-of-pocket claim does
not include bidding costs. However, as Venezuela correctly points out, Aucoven’s
first statement of its claim for out-of-pocket costs expressly mentioned “bidding
costs” as an element of Aucoven’s claim for out-of-pocket costs (cf. Lakshmanan
Rep. Appendix 7, note 4, Appendix 11 note 3). Aucoven replies that its financial
statements do not reflect bidding costs. In its Reply, Aucoven provides a breakdown
of its administrative costs, which does not list bidding costs (Cl. Reply, §] 204
referring to Cl. Ex. 173). In its Rejoinder, Venezuela recognizes that “there are no
line items in Aucoven’s administrative costs called bidding costs”, but points out that
“there are some cost categories, such as “professional fees” and “other” that are so
vague that they could include bidding costs”. (Ven. Rejoinder, p. 95, referring to
Stulz/Simmons II, | 65). At the hearing, Aucoven’s financial expert acknowledged
that he “was advised that bidding costs would not be - should not be [...] part of the
costs” ((Lakshmanan) Tr. 1047:17-18). In its first post-hearing submission, Aucoven
further emphasized that at the time of the bid Aucoven had not yet been founded
and the bidding costs were actually borne by ICA (Cl. PHB, {] 470).

In its submissions, Venezuela requests a “Bs. 384.1 million decrease in reduction of Aucoven's out-of-
pocket claim in Aucoven’s claim for out-of-pocket costs” based on a first conversion error approximated at
“Bs. 363 million” (Ven. PHB, p. 105).

This figure represents Aucoven’s claimed pre-contract costs not associated with the Seconsa loan. In
assessing this amount, Venezuela emphasizes that “Aucoven has admitted that it includes negotiation
costs without attempting to segregate negotiation costs from other costs that may be included in this
category” (Ven. PHB, p. 107, note 86).

71/113,

262.

263.

264.

265.

On the basis of these elements, the Tribunal is not convinced that Aucoven’s
financial statements, and consequently its claim for out-of-pocket costs, include
unrecoverable bidding costs. The Arbitral Tribunal finally notes that in its last
submission Venezuela abandoned its contention related to bidding costs and
insisted on negotiation costs.

As to the negotiation costs, the parties disagree on their recoverability. Venezuela
contends that, like bidding costs, negotiation costs are not recoverable pursuant to
the Agreement, the Bidding Documents and Venezuelan law (Ven. PHR, p. 75).
Aucoven’s position is “that negotiating expenses, like any other precontract
expenses, are recoverable under Clause 60(2)(i), (iv) and (v) of the Concession
Agreement” (CI. PHR, {| 285) and that “Venezuela does not explain on what legal
basis negotiation costs should be excluded” (CI. PHM, {J 469).

The Tribunal has already found that Clause 60(2)(v), according to which the
Concessionaire is entitled to recover “all losses and damages’ is a proper basis for
Aucoven’s claim for out-of-pocket costs (see Section 2 above). It is not seriously
disputable that the plain wording of Clause 60(2)(v) allows Aucoven to claim
negotiation costs. Moreover, the unchallenged testimony of Dr. Badell mentioned by
Venezuela in this respect was limited, insofar as Venezuelan law is concerned, to
the recoverability of bidding costs (Ven PHR, p. 75). Accordingly, the Tribunal can
only conclude that nothing on record establishes that negotiation costs are not
recoverable under Venezuelan law when a contract provision clearly allows recovery
of “all losses and damages”.

To summarize, negotiation costs should be included in Aucoven’s claim for out-of-
pocket costs. Since Aucoven’s claim for out-of-pocket costs does not reflect bidding
costs, the Tribunal will deny Venezuela’s request to decrease Aucoven’s claim for
out-of-pocket costs by Bs. 290 million. Accordingly, Bs. 290 million shall be added to
the amount that Venezuela has admitted as out-of-pocket costs.

The Seconsa loan

Venezuela’s further contention as to the amount of out-of-pocket costs relates to
Aucoven's claim for Bs. 510 million (US$ 3.0 million) in alleged “losses” on a US$
3.6 million loan Aucoven made to an affiliate, Seconsa. This contention is made
notwithstanding Aucoven’s admission that it charged absolutely no interest to
Seconsa for the time during which Seconsa had full use of the entire US$ 3.6 million

amount.

72/113,

266.

267.

268.

269.

Aucoven’s defense is that exchange gains fully offset the Seconsa inflation “losses”.
This argument lost its credibility when Mr. Lakshmanan admitted on cross-
examination that neither the financial statements of Aucoven nor his own
workpapers supported the position that an offset occurred and that he himself had
never seen any documents supporting such an argument (Tr. 1287:14; 1288:8;
1290:15-1295:17).

The issue thus hinges on burden of proof. Relying upon Mr. Lakshmanan’s
admission at the hearing, Venezuela contends that Aucoven has provided no
evidence to support its Seconsa loss claim. By contrast, Aucoven asserts that it has
made a prima facie case by submitting its financial statements, and that, therefore,
the burden of proof shifts to Venezuela, which must rebut the evidence presented by
the Claimant or face the prospect of this issue being decided against it (Cl. PHR, 7]
290 referring to R. von Mehren, Burden of Proof in International Arbitration, ICCA
Congress Series Nr. 7 (1994), 123, Cl. Auth. 67, at 124, Asian Agricultural Products
Ltd. v. Sri Lanka, supra, at 272, ] 56).

The Tribunal finds that Venezuela has cast sufficient doubts to rebut the prima facie
evidence presented by Aucoven in respect of the losses allegedly incurred in
relation with the Seconsa loan. In particular, the following circumstances should be
borne in mind:

- First, Aucoven’s financial expert admitted that he relied exclusively upon
Aucoven’s characterization of the transaction without disposing of any
underlying materials confirming that position.

- Second, Aucoven repeatedly changed its version about the real nature of the
transaction with Seconsa. The financial statements describe the transaction as
a ‘loan to an affiliate”. Mr. Lakshmanan acknowledged that this was an error of
labeling and that the transaction was in fact “an advance, or prepaid asset, not
a loan”. The last characterization as a “security deposit” was contradicted by
Aucoven’s position at the hearing.

- Finally, and most importantly, although these inconsistencies were addressed
in the report of Venezuela’s financial experts (Stulz/Simmons Il, p. 40),
Aucoven did not cross-examine Dr. Simmons.

In conclusion, the Tribunal is not convinced by Aucoven’s attempt to establish a loss
in connection with the Seconsa transaction. Accordingly, Venezuela’s request to

73/113,

3.5

270.

271.

272.

273.

deduct Bs. 510 million from Aucoven’s claim for out-of-pocket losses, specifically
from the “pre-termination” assets contribution’® shall be accepted. Hence, no
amount will be added on this account to those admitted by Venezuela.

Legal fees in actions not related to this arbitration

It is undisputed that Aucoven was compelled to defend against legal and
administrative challenges brought against the award of the Concession and the
Concession Agreement. Venezuela contends that the Tribunal should delete
Bs. 235.8 million (US$ 1.4 million), which Aucoven claims in connection with the
costs of these legal proceedings.

Relying on Dr. Badell’s opinion, Venezuela claims that legal costs are not allowable
in the absence of an explicit contractual provision (Ven. PHM, p. 111; Badell |, ]] 98).
Stressing that Dr. Badell did not identify any authority to support this allegation,

Aucoven submits that there is no such rule under Venezuelan law (Cl. PHR, ] 300).

In the Tribunal’s view, Clause 60(2) of the Agreement represents a sufficient
contractual provision to allow legal costs. However, as acknowledged by Aucoven
itself, to be recoverable, these costs must be “the direct and foreseeable result of
Venezuela’s failure to perform in good faith the Concession Agreement” (Cl. PHB, J
487). Aucoven submits that this is the case “given the Ministry’s own role in these
challenges”. While Aucoven submits that these proceedings were initiated by
Venezuelan officials, including the Ministry itself, Venezuela emphasizes that the
major legal proceedings in which Aucoven was involved related to challenges
brought by competing private bidders, which challenges were eventually denied by
the Ministry. As to the inquiry made by members of the Venezuelan National
Assembly, Venezuela submits that the Ministry actively defended against the
congressional challenge to the Agreement at its own expense.

The Tribunal observes that Article 136 of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic

of Venezuela provides that the legislative power is part of the “national public

Venezuela seems to assume that the so-called “Seconsa costs” are part of the “pre-termination losses
incurred” part of Aucoven’s claim (Ven. PHB, p. 119). However, in Aucoven’s calculations, “Net Interest
and Financing Costs” are part of the “pre-termination assets contributed” part of the claim (See, Revised
Exhibit 7 to Lakshmanaan II). For that reason, the Tribunal does not need to address the issue whether the
“interest” that accrues on operating profits during some periods offsets any “interest” that accrues on
operating losses during other periods (Ven. PHB, p. 119). In any event, Venezuela did establish its right to
such an offset.

277.

authority” and that the different branches of the authority are bound to cooperate to
achieve the goals of the state."°

As a result, Venezuela is responsible for the conduct of the members of the National
Assembly. Its objection against Aucoven’s claim for reimbursement of expenses
incurred to resist parliamentary challenge must thus be dismissed.

The position is different for legal costs incurred by Aucoven when defending against
the challenges brought by private competing bidders cannot be imposed on
Venezuela. A legal challenge by unsuccessful competing bidders is a commercial
risk that is inherent to the bidding process in a democratic country providing for legal
supervision of the adjudication process. Moreover, imposing Aucoven’s costs for the
proceedings initiated by competing bidders on Venezuela would be particularly
inappropriate since these challenges were denied by the Ministry.

The Tribunal notes that Aucoven did not segregate legal fees incurred in connection
with challenges brought by competing bidders from those incurred in connection
with parliamentary challenge. Nor do the legal bills produced into the record (as
Appendix 12 to Mr. Martinez’s Supplemental Declaration) distinguish between these
two categories of costs. Taking into account Venezuela’s allegation that “the major
legal proceedings in which Aucoven was involved related [not only] to challenges
brought by competing bidders, [but also] to an inquiry made by members of the
Venezuelan National Assembly” and using its discretion regarding the probative
value of evidence provided in ICSID Arbitration Rule 34.1, the Tribunal will assume
that half of the legal costs claimed by Aucoven were incurred in connection with
challenges brought by competing bidders. These costs being unrecoverable, the
Tribunal holds that one half of Bs. 235.8 million (i.e., Bs. 117.9 million) should be
deleted from Aucoven’s total out-of-pocket cost claim.

Accordingly, Bs. 117.9 million shall be added to the amount that Venezuela has
agreed constitutes legitimate out-of-pocket costs.

Studies and additional works

Venezuela’s next contention as to the amount of out-of-pocket costs concerns
Aucoven’s claim for Bs. 258,841,070 (US$ 1.5 million) for soil studies and
“additional” works. The costs for additional works, which are described in Appendix
B to the Fernandez Declaration, amount to Bs. 30,599,970 (approximately US$
180,000). The amount of the costs for studies is Bs. 228,241,100 (US$ 1.32 million).

In connection with soil studies, Venezuela asserts that the Agreement “provides
reimbursement only for completed studies” (Ven. Rejoinder, pp. 99, 104). Relying
upon Aucoven’s admission that no more than 80% of certain soil studies had been
completed (Resp. Ex. 102), Venezuela contends that Aucoven is not entitled to any
compensation for the costs incurred in preparing the studies.

Aucoven replies that it is entitled to be compensated in accordance with Clause
60(2) of the Agreement. Aucoven prepared the studies pursuant to the Concession
Agreement and the terms of the Highway Improvement Agreement. The studies
were “incomplete” only in the sense that the Ministry refused, with no apparent
reason, to approve them (Rejoinder 99; Martinez Il, {J 13-15; Ven. Ex. 102, at 5; Cl.
PHM, {[ 146). Without this failure by Venezuela, Aucoven would have completed the
studies and received payment.

The Tribunal notes that Venezuela does not challenge that the studies were
prepared in accordance with the Agreement. Specifically, Aucoven prepared the
design criteria for the Bridge (Cl. Ex. 38, 59, 68), studies on the structural design of
the Bridge (Cl. Ex. 75), plans for the Bridge (CI. Ex. 99), mechanical soil studies (Cl.
Ex. 41, 85, 92), studies on the design for the breaking ramps (Cl. Ex. 67) and
Environmental Impact Studies (Cl. Ex. 51). Now that the Agreement is terminated,
the costs incurred by Aucoven for these studies are losses that Aucoven suffered.
Accordingly, Aucoven is entitled to the reimbursement of its costs for soil studies
irrespective of the current value that such studies may have for Venezuela.

As to the costs for “additional excess works”, the parties disagree on whether those
works were additional works recoverable under Clauses 25 and 46(1) of the
Agreement, as asserted by Aucoven, or whether they were merely “regular works’,
as asserted by Venezuela.

Venezuela argues that they were duplicative of other valuations submitted by
Aucoven. Aucoven submitted a claim for “Waste Collection and Disposal” in each of

76/113,

284.

285.

286.

3.7

287.

288.

its monthly valuations for work performed and now claims duplicative payment for
“Trash Collection” and “Cleanup of Trash and Weeds Collection,” concerning these

same periods.

Aucoven replies that Mr. Martinez’s testimony establishes that the works were not
duplicative (Cl. PHR, {| 298 referring to Martinez Il, | 39):

The work in question involved: (i) the collection and transportation of

trash throughout the Highway; and (ii) washing canals and islands in

the tollbooth zone. None of these works performed by Aucoven were

required under the Concession Agreement.
Since Venezuela does not contest that costs for additional works are recoverable,
and does not provide evidence to rebut Mr. Martinez’s evidence, the Tribunal holds
that Aucoven is entitled to recover the costs it incurred in connection with the

disputed additional works.

Accordingly, Bs. 258,841,070 which Aucoven claims for soil studies and additional
works shall be added to the amount that Venezuela has agreed constitutes

legitimate out-of-pocket costs.
Interest costs

Venezuela further contests three items of “interest” expense asserted by Aucoven
as part of its claim for out-of-pocket costs for a total of Bs. 383.6 million (US$ 2.3
million). Specifically, Venezuela opposes the payment of (1) Bs. 17.6 million (US$
104,000) in interest incurred for a loan involving an affiliate; (2) Bs. 36.8 million (US$
220,000) in “interest” based on an error in inflation calculation; and (3) Bs. 329.2
million (US$ 1.9 million) in interest incurred for other loans.

As to the first item of “interest” expense, the parties seem to agree that it “should not
have been included in [the] calculation” (Ven PHR, p. citing Mr. Lakshmanan‘s
evidence at Lakshmanan Supp., {] 61). Aucoven contends that “[a]lthough there was
an interest charge recorded on Aucoven’s books because Aucoven was late on a
payment to the affiliate, ultimately the affiliate returned the interest charge in a later
period” and that, as a result, “there was no effect on Aucoven’s financial position”.
(Cl. PHR, ] 309; Cl PHB, {| 495). Accordingly, Aucoven specifies that it “is not
claiming against Venezuela for this interest” (ibid.). However, as correctly pointed
out by Venezuela, the corresponding deletion of Bs. 17.6 million from Aucoven’s
“investment assets” section of its out-of-pocket claim has been compensated by the

77/113,

289.

290.

291.

addition of the very same amount in the “pre-termination operating losses” section
(Ven PHR, p. 83, note 79 referring to Appendix 6 to Cl. PHB, note 3 and note 4).

Since the Bs. 17.6 million (US$ 104,000) in alleged interest are not due but still
included in Aucoven’s calculations, they will be deducted from Aucoven’s claim for
out-of-pocket damages. As with the Seconsa loan, this conclusion is also dictated by
the contradictions in Aucoven’s position as to the exact nature of the disputed loan.
It suffices to mention that the latest report by Aucoven’s financial expert — which is
the basis on which Aucoven relies to assert its damage — states: (a) that the
transaction was a “loan to an affiliate” (Lakshmanan Supp. {| 61); (b) that the cost it
recorded had been reversed in a “previous year” (Lakshmanan Supp.{] 61); and (c)
that the interest expense was offset by a “gain due to inflation” (Lakshmanan Supp.

161).

The second item of “interest” expense disputed by Venezuela refers to an “error” of
calculation of the inflation identified by Venezuela, which results in an alleged
overcharge of Bs. 36.8 million (US$ 216,000). The “error” resulted from Mr.
Lakshmanan’s use of a yearly Venezuelan CPI instead of the more precise monthly
CPI. Relying upon Mr. Lakshmanan’s explanations at the hearing, Aucoven
contends that “using this proration was not unreasonable, because any resulting
over- or understatements of damages would get washed out by converting the
amounts into 1995 bolivars” (Cl. PHB, {| 494 referring to Tr. 1239:4; 1242:12
(Lakshmanan)).

In the Tribunal’s view, the fact that a calculation is not unreasonable does not mean
that it is acceptable. If a more precise calculation is possible, the Tribunal must rely
on this more precise calculation. In the present case, Aucoven does not really
dispute that the calculation methodology proposed by Venezuela is more precise.
Admittedly, Aucoven contends that the difference between the two approaches is
eliminated when the amounts are converted into 1995 bolivars. However, the Bs.
36.8 million amount is “already stated in 1995 bolivars and therefore cannot be
‘washed out’ by converting the amounts into 1995 bolivars as Aucoven claimed”
(Ven. PHR, p. 84 referring to Stulz/Simmons Supp. {| 70). Accordingly, the Tribunal
is unable to consider that the difference between the amount calculated according to
an annual CPI rate and the one calculated according to the monthly TPI rate is
eliminated.

78/113,

292.

293.

294.

295.

Considering that Aucoven does not deny that the difference in the calculation
methodology results in a difference of Bs. 36.8 million, the Tribunal finds that this
amount must be deducted from Aucoven’s out-of-pocket claim.”° In coming to that
conclusion, the Tribunal emphasizes that this is not, as Aucoven seems to suggest,
“because in this one instance [the chosen] particular methodology favors
Venezuela”, but because this methodology more accurately reflects the costs
incurred.

The third item of “interest” expense contested by Venezuela is related to interest
Aucoven incurred on short term loans through September 1998 for an amount of
Bs. 329.2 million (US$ 1.9 million).

It is undisputed that Aucoven underwent a serious liquidity crisis that could only be
remedied through financing from short term loans. The parties disagree on the
reasons that made these loans necessary. While Aucoven contends that the liquidity
crisis were the “direct result of Venezuela’s failure to comply with its obligations to
increase the tolls, to pay the Minimum Guaranteed Income, to issue a guarantee to
ING Bank, to promptly establish a trust and to maintain the Economic-Financial
Equilibrium“ (Cl. PHR, {| 307), Venezuela asserts that any shortage of liquidity “was
attributable wholly to the actions or inactions of ICA and Aucoven, and not to any
actions required to be taken by the Republic under the Contract” (Ven PHR, p. 85).
In support of this contention, Venezuela invokes two arguments:

e first, Aucoven failed to provide an adequate trust agreement consistent with
the bidding documents (Ven. PHB, pp. 45-46), and

*® second, ICA — Aucoven’s main shareholder — failed to infuse Bs. 3.9 billion
(US$ 22.9 million) for shares of Aucoven that it had already “purchased” but
not paid for (Ven. PHR, p. 85 referring to Ven. Mem. pp 47 and 78).

The Tribunal observes that Aucoven has not disputed the fact that its main
shareholder did not pay for the shares it acquired. As a result, it is not established

that the need for loans triggering the payment of interest in the amount of the

Specifically from the “assets contributed”. Taking into account the approximate 1/2 ratio between pre-
termination “Net Interest and Financing Costs” (Bs. 331 million (i.e., Bs. 660 million, see Lakshmanan |,
Exhibit 7 after deduction of Bs. 329 million for unrecoverable short term loans) and post-termination “Net
Interest and Financing Costs” (Bs. 188 million, see Lakshmanan | Exhibit 11), the Tribunal finds that Bs.
18.4 million should be deleted from pre-termination assets contributed and Bs. 18.4 from post-termination
assets contributed.

299.

* Hence, this

interest challenged here was caused by Venezuela’s breaches.”
amount should therefore be deducted from Aucoven’s claim for out-of-pocket costs,

specifically from the “pre-termination” losses.

To sum up, all three items of “interest” expense contested by Venezuela totaling Bs.
383.6 million (US$ 2.3 million) should be deducted from Aucoven’s claim for out-of-

pocket costs.
Administrative costs

Aucoven claims administrative costs in a total amount of Bs. 1.5 billion (US$ 8.8
million) (Lakshmanan Supp. Exs. 5, 7, 10, 11).

Venezuela objects that these administrative costs are approximately twice as much
as they should have been taking the EFP administrative cost projection into account,
and at least five times as much as they should have been considering the scaled-
back nature of Aucoven’s responsibilities (Ven. PHB, p. 114, referring to Ven. Mem.
at 98-99).

Aucoven does not contest the magnitude of the increase in its administrative costs.
It rather contends that it was caused by Venezuela’s failure to comply with its
obligations under the Concession Agreement. Specifically, Aucoven refers to the
following activities undertaken as a result of Venezuela’s breaches of the
Agreement: “(i) run an administrative gauntlet, and expend substantial resources
merely attempting to persuade Venezuela to comply with its contractual obligations;
(ii) negotiate with private banks to obtain short-term loans in order to keep the
project afloat despite Venezuela’s failure to raise the tolls, approve the trust, or pay
the Minimum Guaranteed Income; (iii) negotiate with the Inter-American
Development Bank; (iv) assist its lawyers in the preparation of submissions in
multiple administrative and legal proceedings initiated by Venezuela against
Aucoven; and (v) pay the VAT”.

As to the interest on short term loans, Aucoven refers to its Exhibits 106 to 109, which show interest
payments much higher than the amounts contested by Venezuela (Bs. 329.2 million). For instance,
Claimant's Exhibit 106 shows that, between July 30, 1997 and September 27, 1998, Aucoven paid Bs.
788,108,750 to Banco Provincial as interest on a credit of Bs. 1.950 million (at a rate ranging from 20% to
70 %). The Tribunal notes that the amount of the principal of this (single) loan is lower than the amount
which ICA had to infuse for Aucoven’s shares, and that the amount of the interest paid on this (single)
short term loan is higher than the amount contested by Venezuela.

Venezuela contends that Aucoven did not “carry its burden of proof on this issue”
and concludes that “the Tribunal would be entirely justified in disqualifying this item
of costs in its entirety. Short of that, the Tribunal should delete at least 10% (Bs. 150
million (US$ 882,000)) from Aucoven’s claimed total amount of alleged
administrative costs” (Ven PHB, p.114).

The Tribunal is satisfied that Aucoven incurred additional costs as a result of the
contractual breaches by Venezuela referred to above. However, it is true that the
increase alleged by Aucoven is very substantial. Moreover, Ex. 5, 7, 10, 11 to Mr.
Lakshmanan Supplemental Report do not allow the Tribunal to draw definitive
conclusions as to the appropriateness of such amounts.

Under these conditions, the Tribunal finds that it is appropriate to reduce the total
amount claimed by Aucoven. Using its discretion under ICSID Arbitration Rule 34.1,
it is satisfied that the 10% reduction proposed by Venezuela as a secondary relief,
leads to a fair and adequate compensation.

In conclusion, the Tribunal holds that Aucoven is entitled to recover Bs. 1.35 billion
(1.5 billion — 10%). Hence, Bs. 150,000,000 shall reduce Aucoven’s claim for out-of-
pocket costs, specifically the “post-termination” assets contribution.”

Conclusion

On the basis of the foregoing developments, the Tribunal concludes that Aucoven is
entitled to recover the amount of out-of-pocket expenses accepted by Venezuela
increased by the amounts challenged by Venezuela but accepted by the Tribunal.

The out-of-pocket expenses to which Aucoven is entitled may be summarized as
follows:

 

806,653,930 Out-of-pocket costs accepted by Venezuela (see supra N° 250)

 

See L Exhibit 11 which includes “administrative cost” in the “assets contributed”.

Introductory comments

Citing a significant number of international decisions, Aucoven bases its lost profits

analysis on the general principle that the claimant must be made whole, i.e., must

be awarded damages such as to place it in the position it would be in had the

contract been performed in accordance with its terms (CI. PHR, {J 78).

Venezuela does not dispute, the principle of a right to recover lost profits in case of
breach. However, it disputes Aucoven's entitlement to lost profits on the following
main bases:

. First, Venezuela contends that “Aucoven’s own breaches of the contract
constitute an independent bar to Aucoven’s lost profits claim”.

. Second, Venezuela contends that, even if Aucoven could claim lost profits as
a matter of law, such claim should nevertheless be dismissed on the basis of
the facts of the case, since Aucoven did not establish that it suffered a loss of

future profits.

In the following Sections, the Arbitral Tribunal will review whether Aucoven is barred
from claiming lost profits (Section 2), what the pertinent standards for an award of
lost profits are (Section 3), and whether Aucoven has met these standards
(Section 4).

Is Aucoven barred from claiming lost profits?

The relevant provisions of Venezuelan law and of the Concession Agreement

In substance, Venezuela argues that both under general Venezuelan law (Ven.
Rejoinder, p. 52 citing Badell J] 90-91; Badell Supp. {| 74) and “under Article 67 of
Decree Law No. 138 and Articles 60(b) and 60(1) of the Contract, Aucoven may not
assert a claim for loss of future profits if Aucoven itself breached the Contract” (Ven.
PHR, p. 128).

Article 67 of Decree Law No. 138 provides the following in respect of “Termination of
the Agreement Due to Breach by the Concessionaire”:

The Concessionaire shall only have the right to be reimbursed for

the following expenses:

1. Expropriations [...].

2. The constructed works, based upon what is actually completed
according to the projects and prices approved [...].

3. Any other items used to provide [...].
Similarly, Clause 60 of the Agreement provides:

The Concession shall terminate when... [djue to THE
CONCESSIONAIRE’S nonfulfillment of a major obligation required to
realize the purpose of the Concession” (Clause 60 b.) In this case,
“THE MINISTRY shall notify THE CONCESSIONAIRE in writing of
the nonfulfillment... and THE CONCESSIONAIRE shall have ninety

2.2

314.

315.

316.

(90) contiguous days in which to rectify that nonfulfillment. If THE

CONCESSIONAIRE is unable to rectify such nonfulfillment for a

reason attributable to it, the Concesssion shall be terminated, and

the provisions of Chapter | of Title V of the Decree Law No. 138[°]

shall be observed.”
Aucoven admits that pursuant to Article 67 of Decree Law No. 138 and Articles
60(b) and 60(1) of the Agreement it is not entitled to lost profits if it failed to fulfill a
major obligation. However, Aucoven posits that these provisions do not bar its lost
profits claim because they exclude compensation for lost profits “only if Venezuela
terminates the Concession Agreement due to a material breach by Aucoven” (Cl.
PHR, {] 249, emphasis in the original).

The necessity of a termination by Venezuela

Aucoven’s argument relies upon a strict interpretation of the wording of Article 67 of
Decree Law No. 138 and Articles 60(b) and 60(1) of the Agreement. Aucoven
explicitly raised this argument in its Post-Hearing Reply, so that Venezuela did not
respond to it. However, the question was discussed at the hearing following the
statement of Aucoven’s legal expert that these provisions do not apply in the present
case since the Republic did not make use of the notice provisions to terminate the
Agreement (Tr. 778:9-15).

According to Venezuela, such a “technical argument” may apply to the specific
contractual provisions, but cannot defeat the application of the broader legal
principle which the latter express. Relying on Dr. Badell’s testimony, Venezuela
argues that, under a general principle of administrative contracts, no claim for lost
profits is permissible in the event of breach of contract by a contractor (Ven PHB, p.
54, referring to Badell | {J 90-91, Badell Supp. ] 74 and Tr. 779:11-20).

The Tribunal notes that Clauses 60 and 67 of the Concession Agreement do not
apply directly in the present case, because it is undisputed that Venezuela did not
terminate the Agreement. However, these provisions can be considered as the
expression of a wider principle, namely the so-called exceptio non adimpleti
contractus. At the hearing, Aucoven’s legal expert did not deny the existence and
applicability of the exceptio non adimpleti contractus as reflected in Article 168 of the

These provisions (i.e., Articles 61 to 63 of Decree Law No. 138) concern the delivery of the works and
facilities necessary to provide the service to the Republic.

Venezuelan Civil Code. Therefore, the Tribunal accepts that Aucoven’s own

breaches of the Concession Agreement may bar recovery of lost profits.
Must the alleged breaches be material?

At the hearing, Aucoven’s legal expert advanced the argument that Aucoven’s
alleged breaches could not bar a claim for lost profits since they were immaterial (Tr.
778:16; 779:5). Aucoven did not expand on this argument in its Post-Hearing Brief.
In its Post-Hearing Reply, it alleged that “Clause 60(b) of the Concession Agreement
allows for termination only in the event of a breach of ‘a major obligation required to
realize the purpose of the Concession’ — in other words, of a material breach.”
Accordingly, Aucoven writes, “Venezuela's allegations, even if established, would
not amount to material breaches of the Concession Agreement” (Cl. PHR, {] 251).

The Tribunal is aware that Venezuela did not have an opportunity to respond to this
last submission by Aucoven. However, the argument was already made at the
hearing and Venezuela did address it in its Post-Hearing Brief (“[flor the first time at
the hearing, Dr. Ortiz advanced the argument that Aucoven’s breach were
immaterial”). Venezuela rejected the argument on the ground that “Aucoven in fact
breached all of its obligations under the contract”. In doing so, Venezuela can be
viewed as implicitly admitting that only material breaches may bar Aucoven’s claim
for lost profits. Moreover, Venezuela’s legal expert did not deny that materiality was
a condition to the barring effect of the breaches. In fact, Dr. Badell admitted that he
failed to mention the materiality requirement in his opinions and did not examine
whether any of Aucoven’s alleged breaches were material as a matter of
Venezuelan law (Tr. 683:19; 684:18; 688:9-18). Hence, the Tribunal is satisfied that
Aucoven’s alleged breaches may bar the lost profits claim only if they are material,
i.e., if they would have allowed Venezuela to terminate the Concession Agreement.

Prior to deciding whether any alleged breaches are material, the Tribunal must

obviously first review the existence of any breaches by Aucoven.
Did Aucoven breach the Agreement?

According to Venezuela, Aucoven breached the Concession Agreement: (1) by
failing to perform routine maintenance works on the Highway; (2) by failing to
provide routine maintenance on the Old Road; (3) by failing to perform certain of the
tasks laid out in the Highway Improvement Agreement; and (4) by walking off the job
two years after terminating the Concession Agreement (Ven. PHM, {| 54 ff.).

85/113

a) Routine maintenance works on the Highway

Venezuela argues that Aucoven failed to perform routine maintenance works on the
Highway in accordance with Clause 15 of the Concession Agreement (Ven. PHB, p.
56-58). The parties disagree on whether this contention is supported by the record
as a matter of fact:

. For Venezuela, the evidence demonstrates that Aucoven failed entirely to
perform important elements of its routine maintenance obligations established
under the Concession Agreement, and that the scope and quantity of work
performed by Aucoven for maintenance steadily decreased during the period
in which Aucoven operated the Highway. Venezuela’s position relies upon the
testimony of Mr. Fernandez, who was called by Venezuela (Fernandez Supp.
11 4-13) to testify on public opinion concerns reported in the press (Ven. PHB
pp. 112-117, 120, 122), and on a series of photographs taken on a single day
in August 2002 revealing “potholes, broken lighting fixtures, trash piled up on
the median strip and along the edge of the Highway and a variety of other
conditions that simply would not exist if the Highway had been maintained in
the most basic routine fashion” (Ven. PHB p. 57, referring to Fernandez Il, {| 4
and App. A).

. Aucoven replies that “Venezuela did not submit any contemporaneous
evidence showing that Aucoven failed to perform routine maintenance before
it terminated the Concession Agreement on June 13, 2000, and it cannot point
to any contemporaneous document by which it advised Aucoven of its
supposed failures. [...] To the contrary, the valuations submitted as
appendices to Mr. Martinez’s second statement show that Aucoven did
maintain, under the direct supervision of the Ministry's inspector, the Highway
as required under the Concession Agreement” (Cl. PHR {| 254). As to the
photographs submitted by Venezuela, Aucoven considers that “some pictures
taken two years after the termination of the Concession Agreement, which
show an occasional pothole on the side of the road” are not sufficient
evidence (Cl. PHB {| 440).

The Tribunal agrees with Venezuela that the litigious pictures “were not limited to ‘an
occasional pothole,’ but [...] instead show numerous potholes, trash piled up in the
median strip and along the Highway, broken lamps” (Ven. PHR, p. 129). However, it
is not convinced that this is sufficient evidence to conclude, as Venezuela does, that

these “and other problems [...] surely would not exist if routine maintenance were

86/113

323.

324.

325.

326.

24

properly performed” (/oc. cit.). The Highway is 17 km long and the possibility that
some problems exist at a certain time in certain places is not necessarily due to a
failure in maintenance. One assumes that a failure in maintenance would rather
have led to systemic problems. In that case, one would expect the record to contain
evidence of complaints by Venezuela about Aucoven’s failures. As Aucoven
emphasizes, Venezuela is unable to point to any document by which it complained
about Aucoven’s maintenance work. This circumstance is particularly significant
given that Aucoven periodically submitted to Venezuela valuations of its

maintenance work (see Cl. Ex. 122).

Based upon the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal finds that Venezuela did not
establish that Aucoven breached its obligation to perform routine maintenance
works on the Highway,” nor did it demonstrate that such breach, if any, would have

been material.

b) Routine maintenance on the Old Road

It is undisputed that Clause 15 of the Agreement required Aucoven to perform
routine maintenance on the Old Road. It is equally undisputed that Aucoven never
undertook any maintenance work on the Old Road.

According to Aucoven, despite the text of Clause 15, “the parties agreed from the
start that Aucoven’s routine maintenance obligations pursuant to Clause 15 did not
include the Old Road” (CI. PHB, {| 443). Because of the very bad conditions of the
Old Road, the Ministry agreed that until the initial improvement work was completed
on the Old Road any routine maintenance work on the Old Road would be useless
and impossible — and the few resources available because of Venezuela’s breach
were better spent on the Highway (Cl. PHR, {] 258).

Venezuela's insistence on the testimony of Aucoven’s own witnesses that “the plain
language of the contract requires Aucoven to maintain the Old Highway” (Ven PHB,
p. 58 referring to Mr. Martinez testimony, Martinez II {| 9) and that “the Contract had
never been amended” (Ven PHR, p. 131 referring to Mr Salas’s oral testimony; Tr.
265:4-6) does not contradict Aucoven’s position. Indeed, parties may agree not to

Having reached this conclusion on a factual basis by evaluating the evidence on record, the Tribunal does
not need to address Aucoven’s legal argument that “Aucoven was no longer obliged under Clause 15 of
the Concession Agreement to perform any routine maintenance after it had terminated the Concession
Agreement, and it therefore could not have breached that obligation” (CI. PHR, 255).

331.

perform part of a contract without formally amending it, in particular when this non-
performance is meant to be temporary.

In the Tribunal’s view, the fact that Venezuela cannot point to any document in
which it required Aucoven to perform its maintenance obligation on the Old Road
convincingly shows the parties’ mutual recognition that this obligation had become
moot.

c) The tasks laid out in the Highway Improvement Agreement

The dispute here deals with Aucoven’s obligation to retile and improve the
ventilation in Boquéron Tunnel Nr. 1.

Aucoven does not dispute that it did not perform this obligation as set forth in the
Highway Improvement Agreement, but it claims that, upon the Ministry’s request, the
parties agreed on 28 April 1997 that the works in Boquerén Tunnel Nr. 1 would be
limited to renewing the asphaltic pavement and to making horizontal demarcations,
which Venezuela acknowledges Aucoven performed.

As Venezuela accurately stresses, Aucoven’s witness, Mr. Salas, acknowledged
that the Ministry never agreed to excuse Aucoven’s performance but merely to
postpone it (Ven PHR, p. 135). This being so, nothing in the record shows that
Venezuela decided to put an end to the mutually agreed postponement. In these
circumstances, the Tribunal finds that Aucoven’s obligation was suspended and,
thus, Aucoven was not in breach of the Highway Improvement Agreement.

d) Cessation of the activities in 2002

Since Aucoven was entitled to terminate the Concession Agreement in June 2000,
Venezuela cannot rely on Aucoven’s cessation of activities in 2002 to bar Aucoven’s
claim for lost profits raised on the ground of termination. This does not necessarily
mean, as Aucoven’s writes, that Aucoven was not bound by any obligation and was
thus not in a position to commit any breach anymore (Cl. PHB, {] 453). It rather
means that any possible breach would not arise from the same legal relationship as
the claim for lost profits. Accordingly, the cessation of activities in 2002 cannot bar
Aucoven from claiming lost profits under the Concession Agreement.

Conclusion

On the basis of the foregoing developments, the Tribunal concludes that Aucoven
did not breach the Concession Agreement in a manner that may bar a claim for lost
profits.

The standards of recovery of lost profits

The positions of the parties

a) Aucoven’s position

Aucoven submits that the Concession Agreement explicitly entitles it to recover its
lost profits in the event of a valid termination. Specifically, it refers to Clause 60(2),
which provides that Venezuela shall compensate Aucoven for “all losses or
damages, including lost profits and damnum emergens’”.

According to Aucoven, the purpose of a compensation for lost profits “is to make the
claimant whole by putting the claimant in the position it would have been in if the
respondent had not breached the contract, but instead performed it as agreed” (Cl.
PHR, {| 78). This is a principle which is common to both Venezuelan law and
international law.

With respect to the assessment of the lost profits, Aucoven’s position may be

summarized as follows;

. The date as of which the value of the Concession Agreement should be
determined is the day immediately preceding the breach of the Concession
Agreement. In the present case, the relevant date is 1997.

. The value of the Concession Agreement is determined by discounting the
project’s cash flows to their present value in 1997.

. The shareholder flow line in the EFP indicates the parties’ joint projections of
Aucoven’s net cash flows for each semester of the thirty-year Concession
period and thus reflects the bottom-line profit Aucoven stood to realize in any
given semester. It represents the 15.21% real annual return Aucoven would
earn over the thirty-year Concession period on its projected investment. Since
it reflects the obligations under the Concession Agreement, it mirrors the
parties’ estimate as to the cash flows due Aucoven if the Concession
Agreement had been performed as stipulated. Under the EFP, the total value

89/113

336.

337.

338.

339.

3.2

340.

of the shareholder flows over the life of the Concession was
Bs. 53,817,233,000.

. The expected rate of return available in capital markets on alternative
investments of equivalent risk provides the appropriate discount rate.
According to Aucoven, such discount rate corresponds to the US Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).

. There should be no further reduction or mitigation of damages.

b) Venezuela’s position

Venezuela contends that Aucoven’s claim is inconsistent with both the Concession
Agreement and Venezuelan law and should be dismissed. Moreover, Venezuela
submits that international law would not lead to a different result.

First, Venezuela submits that the Concession Agreement provides for a “fair and
equitable remuneration”, which corresponds to the 15.21% internal rate of return
based on Aucoven’s investments in the project. Aucoven would receive cash flows
that constituted a 15.21% return on its investment, rather that an immutable series
of cash flows stated in absolute amounts. The shareholder flows contained in the
initial EFP were a projection that needed to be amended to maintain a 15.21% rate
of return based on the amounts actually invested. Since Aucoven did not make any
of the investment in works contemplated in the Concession Agreement, Aucoven
has no right to pursue a claim for lost profits based on the amounts stated on the
shareholder flow line.

Second, Venezuela contends that Aucoven's claim does not meet the requirements
of definiteness and proportionality imposed by Venezuelan law and constitutes an
improper windfall to Aucoven.

Finally, Venezuela argues that, as a matter of economics, Aucoven did not suffer
any loss of future profits. Indeed, Venezuela alleges that any future cash flows,
when discounted with the proper discount rate — including sovereign risk and project
risk — lead to a net present value of zero.

Lost profits under the Concession Agreement

Aucoven's claim for lost profits is based on the relevant provisions of the
Concession Agreement and on the requirements set by Venezuelan law. The parties

90/113

341.

342.

3.3

343.

344.

345.

do not contend that Venezuelan law is incompatible with international law as to the
scope of recoverable lost profits. Hence, the Tribunal will address the issues
presented by application of the contractual and national law provisions. It will merely
refer to international practice as a matter of additional guidance.

Clause 60(2) of the Concession Agreement provides as follows:

Without prejudice to the provisions of this document, in the event of
nonftulfillment of any of the obligations undertaken in this Agreement
by or through THE MINISTRY, [...] THE CONCESSIONAIRE may
terminate this Agreement [...] and THE MINISTRY must compensate
and indemnify THE CONCESSIONAIRE pursuant to the terms
stipulated in this Second paragraph for the case of early
repossession [including "all losses or damages, including lost profits
and damnum emergens’].
The Concession Agreement does not define the scope and measure of "lost profits".
Failing a specific contract rule, the Tribunal will turn to the standards of recovery set

by the applicable law.
Lost profits under Venezuelan law

According to Aucoven, lost profits under Venezuelan law cover the compensation
required to "make the claimant whole", by putting it in the position it would have
been in if the Respondent had not breached the contract, but instead performed it as
agreed (Cl. PHR, ff 78-79).

Venezuela applies the same standard, although expressed with different words.
Indeed, according to its legal expert, the purpose of an award of lost profits is to
compensate the creditor for damages suffered, not to impoverish nor enrich it.
(Badell Supp. {| 83).

In a decision relied upon by the Claimant, the Venezuelan Supreme Court defined
lost profits as follows:

[L]ost profits is the utility or revenue of which the injured party has
been deprived as a result of the violation, delay or breach by the
other party. It consists of the non-increase in the creditor's
patrimonium as a result of the deprivation of the increase that would
normally have taken place in his patrimonium if the breach had not
taken place. (Cl. PHR, | 89).

(Diques y Astilleros Nacionales (DIANCA), excerpted in L. Ortiz-
Alvarez & G. Mascetti, Jurisprudencia de Contratos Administrativos
1980-1999 (1999), Ortiz Auth. 106, p. 596 (translation by Aucoven)).

346.

348.

349.

350.

The Tribunal agrees that the scope and purpose of lost profits compensation under
Venezuelan law is to indemnify the claimant for all, but not more than, the damage
actually suffered. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal adds that this solution
is consistent with the practice of international tribunals. It suffices to refer to the
consistent jurisprudence of ICSID Tribunals” and of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal.”°

To be granted compensation for lost profits so defined, a claimant must prove the
amount of its loss. Only these proven amounts will be awarded.

In this respect, Venezuela contends that lost profits may not be awarded under
Venezuelan administrative law if they are remote, uncertain or speculative (Ven.
PHR, p. 144). Aucoven concurs in substance with Venezuela's position, as it
submits that lost profits may be awarded as long as they are not too remote,
uncertain or speculative (Cl. PHB, J 282). It adds that under Venezuelan law lost
profits require only a reasonable showing of lost opportunity to make such profits
(Cl. PHB, 7 281).

The Venezuelan Supreme Court has specified the standards of proof in the following
terms:

It is necessary for the claimant to provide the necessary evidence,
not necessarily demonstrative, but evidence not based on
speculation, or on the mere possibility of making a profit. If it is not
possible to present credible evidence, at least the claimant must
provide evidence that allows the establishment of indicia that allow
the presumption that effectively [the claimant] had the opportunity to
make a profit and could not [do so] as a result of the breach of the
other party.

(Diques y Astilleros Nacionales (DIANCA), excerpted in L. Ortiz-
Alvarez & G. Mascetti, Jurisprudencia de Contratos Administrativos
1980-1999 (1999), Ortiz Auth. 106, p. 596 (translation by Aucoven))

The necessity to prove the amount of the profits lost is confirmed by scholarly
commentary:

It is necessary to adopt a restrictive criteria for the determination of
lost profits, since the profits that have been lost must be real, proven

Case Studies, in ICSID Review, 1991, p. 400, 403.

with a basis of objective information, and it is not enough to assume
possible results but that lack certainty, coming from speculations or
hypothetical suppositions, doubtful or contingent.

(R. Escobar-Gil, Responsabilidad Contractual de la Administracion
Publica, Bogota 1989, p. 187)

Again, the Tribunal notes that the requirement of Venezuelan law pursuant to which
lost profits must be established with sufficient certainty and cannot be awarded on
the basis of speculative assessments is consistent with the practice of international
tribunals. Decisions issued by ICSID tribunals’” and by the Iran-US Claims
Tribunal® have often dismissed claims for lost profits in cases of breach of contract
on the ground that they were speculative and that the claimant had not proven with

a sufficient degree of certainty that the project would have resulted in a profit.

The Tribunal will now turn to reviewing whether Aucoven has established the
existence and amount of the lost profits for which it seeks compensation with a
sufficient degree of certainty.

Does Aucoven’s claim for lost profits meet the relevant standards?

After an extensive review of the detailed economic and financial evidence on record
and of the parties’ discussion of such evidence, the Arbitral Tribunal is disinclined to
award lost profits in the circumstances of this case. It reaches the conclusion that
Aucoven has not made a showing of future lost profits with a sufficient degree of
certainty under the relevant standards set forth above.

It is not disputed that lost profits, if awarded, should be computed on the basis of the
expected cash flows under the Concession Agreement. There is no common
ground, however, on the determination of such expected cash flows:

. According to Aucoven, the expected cash flows are to be determined using
the shareholder flow line appearing in the Economic-Financial Plan of the
Concession Agreement. The shareholder cash flow line represents the
15.21% real annual return which Aucoven would have earned on its projected

investment over the thirty-year Concession period (Cl. PHR, {| 130, emphasis
added).

. By contrast, Venezuela asserts that the agreed “fair and equitable
remuneration” is a 15.21% internal rate of return which must be “based on
Aucoven’s actual investment in the project” (Ven. PHR, p. 141, emphasis
added).

Aucoven further contends that, being a reflection of the obligations under the
Concession Agreement, the original EFP “reflects the parties’ agreement on a
detailed forecast of future cash flows” (Cl. PHM, {| 291). Accordingly, it “is the best
evidence conceivable of the cash flows that Aucoven could reasonably have
expected to receive” (Cl. PHM, {| 291). Venezuela, on its part, alleges that the
figures on the shareholder flow line of the initial EFP would have changed over the

period of the Concession and are thus unreliable (Ven. PHB p. 173).

The Tribunal accepts that the Concession Agreement represents the cash flows
which the parties anticipated for the event that no change occurred over the 30-year
Concession period. However, the Concession Agreement itself required updates of
the EFP if an event listed in Clause 46 occurred. Such updates were intended to
restore the EFE, but not to guarantee projected amounts of shareholder flows.”°

One further factor weights heavily in the Tribunal’s; assessment of lost profits. The
main purpose of the Agreement was the construction of the Bridge. The expected
cash flows were agreed as part of a broader agreement, pursuant to which Aucoven
was to build the Bridge and would, in return, receive a “fair and equitable
remuneration”. As a matter of contractual interpretation, one cannot rely exclusively
on the figures set forth in the original EFP without taking into account that the Bridge
was never built. Otherwise, Aucoven would obtain the same compensation that it
would have received had it built the Bridge and, for that purpose, invested the
amounts forecast. The Tribunal is of the opinion that such result cannot be deemed
to correspond to the intent of the parties.

Contrary to Aucoven’s argument, Prof. Stulz has not accepted the shareholder flows of the EFP. He has
used them as a working assumption, as his analysis in any event showed a loss (Stulz/Simmons II, | 93).
He also testified that “very different profits” could be produced under the 15% return rate if the EFP was
amended (Tr. 1342:18-1343:5).

94/113

359.

For these reasons, the Tribunal is not convinced that the figures set forth in the
original EFP represent a sufficient basis to assess Aucoven’s lost profits in a non-
speculative way as required by Venezuelan law. For the same reasons, the Tribunal
does not share Aucoven’s view that the “circumstances fundamentally distinguish
this case from any other case relied upon by Venezuela”, in which the (ICSID)
“tribunals were unable to make a reasonable forecast of future revenue” (Cl. PHB,
292).

In support of its contention that lost profits should not be awarded where they are
not justified by economic evidence, Venezuela relies, inter alia,® upon the following
ICSID precedents:

. S.P.P. (Middle East) Limited, Southern Pacific Properties, Ltd. V. the Arab
Republic of Egypt, \CC Arbitration No. YD/AS No. 3493, Award (Mar. 11,
1983), 22 I.L.M. 752 (1983), Resp. Auth. 21. In this decision, the Tribunal
denied lost profits on the grounds that “the great majority of the work [on the
project] [...] is still to be done,” and that the calculation offered by plaintiffs
“produces a disparity between the amount of the investment made by the
Claimants and its supposed value at the material date” (/d. at 782-83, {] 65).

. Asian Agricultural Products Limited v. Republic of Sri Lanka, |CSID Case No.
ARB/87/3, Award of June 27, 1990, 4 ICSID Rep. 245, Resp. Auth 17. The
Tribunal found there, in connection with a newly formed company, which had
no record of profits and was undercapitalized, that neither the “goodwill” of the
company nor its “future profitability’ [...] could be reasonably established with
a sufficient degree of certainty” (/d. at 292-93).

. Metalclad Corp. v. United Mexican States, |CSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1,
Award (Aug. 30, 2000), 16 ICSID Rev. - FILJ 168, Cl. Auth. 5, at 197-199 9
119-122. In this matter, the Tribunal denied a lost profits claim noting that
“where the enterprise has not operated for a sufficiently long time to establish
a performance record or where it has failed to make a profit, future profits
cannot be used to determine going concern or fair market value”(/d. J 120).

See in addition especially Benvenuti & Bonfant v. Congo, Resp. Auth. 6 (concluding that no lost profits
may be awarded for a beginning enterprise). See also AGIP Spa v. The Government of the People’s
Republic of the Congo, ICSID Case No. ARB/77/1, Award of Nov. 30, 1979, 1 ICSID Rep. 306, 326-27,

. Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4,
Award (Dec. 8, 2000), Resp. Auth. 23, at 64-70 J 118-130. In this decision,
the Tribunal dismissed the claim for future lost profits for the reason that an
award made on such ground would be speculative and in large disparity
compared to the actual investment (/d. at 66-67 {J 123-124).

These decisions show that ICSID tribunals are reluctant to award lost profits for a
beginning industry and unperformed work. This reluctance of ICSID tribunals is
confirmed by the practice of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal.**

It bears emphasizing that the cases cited by Aucoven to support the proposition that
“where future cash flows could be reasonably determined, tribunals have awarded
lost profits even if the project had been only in its initial stage”’ deal with fact
situations in which a substantial part of the project had been realized. Specifically,
the claimant in Karaha Bodas had invested US$ 93 million by the time the breach
occurred®* and the claimant in Delagoa Bay had already completed 82 kilometers
out of a total of a 90 kilometer railway project.**

In the present case, the fact remains that Aucoven had no record of profits and that
it never made the investments in the project nor built the Bridge required by the
Concession Agreement. In these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that
Aucoven’s claim for future profits does not rest on sufficiently certain economic
projections and thus appears speculative. Hence, it does not meet the standards for
an award of lost profits under Venezuelan law, nor would it meet these standards
under international law, if the latter were applicable.

As an additional reason, the Tribunal points out that, even if it had reached a
different conclusion in the preceding paragraphs, the result would be the same.
Indeed, it finds that Aucoven has not established that, once discounted at an
appropriate rate and time, the cash flows would have yielded a positive result. With
respect to the appropriate time or date of valuation, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the

opinion that the proper date is the date when the damage to Aucoven materialized.
It sets this date at the time of termination of the Concession Agreement, not at the
date of the breach.*® Indeed, the breaches committed by Venezuela in and of
themselves did not cause the damage. Aucoven was not deprived of the value of the
contract at that time. It could then still insist on Venezuela restoring the EFE. In
other words, the Concession Agreement contained mechanisms to deal with these
situations. It is only when Aucoven terminated the Concession Agreement that the
damage and the right to lost profits materialized.*°

With respect to the appropriate discount rate, Aucoven and its expert use a risk-free
discount rate, while Venezuela argues that the rate must include a number of risks,
including sovereign or country, project and capital risks. On the basis of the expert
evidence, the Tribunal finds that the cash flows involved certain risks and therefore
a risk-free rate is inappropriate. It first notes that the bidding documents, which are
an integral part of the Concession Agreement (Clause 5), expressly provide that the
bids were to include country and project risks (Cl. Ex. 3). It further notes that a claim
cannot be valued without consideration of its environment, i.e., without consideration
of social, economic, political or other factors which may affect it.°” Under these
circumstances, it can be left open whether the rate used by Prof. Stulz was
conservative because the risks involved in the project were even higher in reality.
The same is true of the extent to which project and capital risks should be taken into
consideration. Indeed, whatever the answers, the evidence shows that the project
was unlikely to generate profits.

In general, the Arbitral Tribunal found the expert evidence put forward by
Venezuela, which established that the Concession Agreement would not have
generated profits even if performed under its terms, convincing. By contrast, it often
remained unpersuaded by the evidence of Aucoven’s expert. For all these reasons,
it restates that Aucoven has not established a loss of future profits pursuant to the

The Tribunal appreciates that the date of breach often coincides with the date on which the damage
materializes, especially in expropriation cases. The situation is different here, however.

The Tribunal notes that, to perform his discounted cash flow analysis, Mr. Lakshmanan has used this
same date (Lakshmanan I, {| 24; Tr. 920:15-921:6).

Aucoven’s expert, Mr. Lakshmanan, admitted that any debt by a sovereign was affected by sovereign risk
(Tr. 969: 10-13). Both experts also testified that sovereign risk is not necessarily linked to the debor's
“propensity to breach”, but rests on a variety economic, social, political and other factors, which affect a
country or region (Lakshmanan, Tr. 953: 2-11; Stulz/Simmons II, | 11).

In addition, as was already addressed above, Aucoven or its parent did not make the investment required
for this project and were thus able to invest the funds into other ventures.

standards governing under Venezuelan law, being specified that the same

conclusion would stand had international law been applicable.

INTEREST

As a result of the findings on lost profits, the present discussion is limited to interest
on out-of-pocket expenses. Aucoven claims pre- and post-award interest.
Venezuela opposes that Venezuelan law does not allow post-award interest on
inflation-adjusted awards. With respect to pre-award interest on out-of-pocket
expenses Venezuela puts forward the following arguments (Ven. PHR, p. 86): (a)
Aucoven’s computation double counts inflation, which is not admissible, (b) interest
starts running from the date on which a competent body declares the contract
terminated, (c) no interest is due on operating losses because the removal of
unrecoverable costs eliminates any such losses, and (d) interest should not be

compounded.

The Tribunal will review the parties’ positions examining the following matters, which
need to be addressed to decide the interest claim: (1) the dates which are relevant
for the interest computation, (2) the rate, (3) compound interest, and (4) the
methodology to compute interest.

Clause 60(2) of the Concession Agreement provides that “[iJn the event of delay in
the payment of the amounts owed under this Clause, late interest shall be calculated
pursuant to the provisions of Clause 26 of this document”. In turn, Clause 26 (as

amended) provides in pertinent part as follows:

The amounts that THE MINISTRY must pay to THE
CONCESSIONAIRE, unless otherwise stipulated, shall be paid to
THE CONCESSIONAIRE within a period not to exceed thirty (30)
business days from the date the obligation is due, in which case late
interest shall accrue in THE CONCESSIONAIRE’S favor from the
end of said period until the date it is effectively paid, which shall in no
event exceed two (2) months from the end of the thirty (30) business
day period mentioned above. [...JThe total amounts that THE
MINISTRY owes to THE CONCESSIONAIRE under this Clause
must be calculated according to either of the following formulas, at
the option of THE CONCESSIONAIRE: (a) The amount owed shall
be equal to the sum of the amount owed plus the “Adjustment”
according to the definition of said term in Clause 26 of the
Concession Agreement, plus interest on unpaid balances, calculated
monthly at an annual rate of 10%, or (b) The amount owed shall be
equal to the amount owed plus interest on unpaid balances
calculated monthly at a rate equal to the average lending rate of the
five (5) principal Banks in the country, in accordance with the latest

classification issued by the Banco Central de Venezuela. The
formulas indicated above include default interest.

The relevant dates

Dies a quo

While Aucoven argues that interest on out-of-pocket expenses “should run from the
date when those expenses were incurred” (Cl. PHR, {] 321) and interest on out-of
pocket assets contributed should run from the end of the period over which they
where contributed (Cl. PHR, {] 325),°° Venezuela argues that interest begins to run
on the date of termination of the Agreement (Ven. PHR, pp. 90-93) and that “since
Aucoven’s litigation-related ‘termination’ letter had no legal effect, no pre-award
interest should be granted [...]%° (Ven. PHR, p. 90). Having held that Aucoven’s
termination was valid, the Tribunal will focus on Venezuela's alternative conclusion
that “no interest can begin to run on Aucoven’s claims [...] until, at the earliest, the
date when a termination of the Contract has taken place” (Ven. PHR, p. 91;
emphasis omitted).

The Tribunal finds that interest should generally run from the date on which the
principal amount to which it applies became due. This approach is consistent with
Clause 26 of the Agreement providing that interest starts to run “thirty (30) business
days from the due date of the obligation”. It also conforms to Art. 1277 of the
Venezuelan Civil Code, pursuant to which interest is due “as of the day of default”
(Badell, Auth. 28).

Aucoven’s claim for out-of-pocket expenses is based on Clauses 60(2) and 26 (CI.
PHR {| 321). Clause 60(2) entitles Aucoven to recover the damages it suffered in the
event it validly terminates the Agreement. Consequently, Aucoven’s claim cannot
become due before the termination has taken place, i.e., before June 13, 2000. In its
calculations, Aucoven “added sixty calendar days, in order to comply with the thirty-
one business day requirement of Clause 26 of the Concession Agreement” (Cl.

It also writes that “[iJnterest should run from the several dates on which the relevant obligations became
due”. (Cl. PHB, ] 515). See also Cl. PHR, {] 313, where Aucoven invokes “the well established principle
under international law that interest runs from the date on which the damage occurred, because it is from
that date that the compensation is due”, referring to Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. (SPP) v.
Arab Republic of Egypt, \CSID Case Nr. ARB/84/3 (1992), Award, May 20, 1992, 3 ICSID Rep. 189 (1992),
Cl. Auth. 31, at 240, If] 234, 235).

Venezuela's argument is technically limited to interest on invested assets.

PHR, {1 320). Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that interest runs from August 1,
2000 on “pre-termination” out-of-pocket expenses.

With regard to pre-termination out-of-pocket “losses”, Aucoven’s interest “was
calculated as of October 31 of the years 1997 and 1998, May 31 of the years 1999,
2000” (Cl. PHR, {| 324 referring to Appendices 5 and 6). In accordance with the
considerations set forth above, the Tribunal will correct such interest computation to
start on August 1, 2000.

With regard to pre-termination asset contributions, Aucoven’s calculations comply
with the Tribunal’s approach. Indeed, “Aucoven assumes that the assets that had
been contributed over the period ending on May 31, 2000, were all contributed on
that date. In order to comply with the thirty-one business day requirement of Clause
26 of the Concession Agreement, Aucoven has added an additional sixty calendar
days, so that interest on the assets contributed starts to run from August 1, 2000”
(Cl. PHR, ¥ 325, italics added).

With regard to post-termination out-of-pocket expenses, the Tribunal finds that
Aucoven’s assumption that “interest[...] should run from the date when those
expenses were incurred” (Cl PHR, ] 321) is applicable. Noting that Venezuela does
not contest this approach, the Tribunal will uphold the computation method
calculation proposed by Aucoven:

e interest on post-termination out-of-pocket “losses” shall be “calculated as of May
31 of the years 2001 and 2002 and as of October 31, 2002”;

e interest on post-termination out-of-pocket “assets contributed” shall be
calculated as of November 1, 2002, sixty calendar days after August 31, 2002
(Cl. PHR, {| 326 referring to Appendix 4).

As a final matter in this context, the Tribunal must address Venezuela’s request for a
post award “grace period [...] during which no interest would run” (Ven. PHB 125).
Having awarded pre-award interest and taken into consideration the contractually
agreed grace period of 60 calendar days, the Tribunal disallows Venezuela's
request.

The dies ad quem

Aucoven claims post-award interest “until the date of the effective payment of the
award by Venezuela” (Cl. PHR, {| 350). In support of its position, it relies on the

100/113

378.

379.

“fundamental point that the parties explicitly agreed in the Concession Agreement
that the interest rates of Clause 26 run ‘until the date [the damages are] effectively
paid” (Cl. PHR, {| 352). More generally, Aucoven argues that “the principle that full
compensation must include interest applies fully to the period between the award
and payment“ (Cl. PHB, {| 524) and refers to the following ICSID precedent (Cl.
PHR, {1 349):

As to the dies ad quem, ... [t]he prevailing jurisprudence in

international arbitrations is to the effect that interest runs until the

date of effective payment, and this conclusion is supported by
doctrinal opinion.

(Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. (SPP) v. Arab

Republic of Egypt, |CSID Case Nr. ARB/84/3 (1992), Award, May 20,

1992, 3 ICSID Rep. 189 (1992), Cl. Auth. 31, at 244, ]] 235).
To oppose Aucoven’s claim, Venezuela relies upon the testimony of its legal expert,
who declared that “post-award interest is not allowed under Venezuelan law when
the claimant seeks an inflation-adjusted award (Ven. PHR, p. 149 referring to Badell
Supp. {] 95). Aucoven objects that Professor Badell’s position is unsubstantiated (Cl.
PHB, {| 525) since he “does not, nor could he, cite one single provision of
Venezuelan law, precedent or authority in support of his proposition”. (Cl. PHR, 7]
351, fn 33). However, at the hearing, Aucoven’s own legal expert was unable to
contradict that position when prompted to address this issue (Tr. 802:6-8: “Quite
honestly, this is a subject area | know nothing about, and | would rather not proffer
an opinion’).

In the absence of any opinion by Aucoven’s legal expert, the Tribunal may be
inclined to rely on the opinion of Prof. Badell and accept that post-award interest is
not allowed under Venezuelan law when the claimant seeks an inflation-adjusted
award. However, for the reasons explained below, the Tribunal considers that
Aucoven does not seek an inflation-adjusted award.

The parties’ positions diverge on whether Aucoven is seeking “an inflation-adjusted
award”. Venezuela’s legal expert considers that it does, “because Aucoven has
requested that the award be stated in 1995 bolivars and then either adjusted for
inflation or converted into dollars” (Badell Supp. {| 95). Aucoven replies that it “does
not ask that the award be indexed for inflation. It merely asks that, in accordance
with Clause 26 of the Concession Agreement, the nominal ‘bank rate’ of interest be
applied to the principal amount awarded in constant bolivars” (Cl. PHR, {] 351).

101/113

380.

381.

382.

a

In the Tribunal’s understanding, an “inflation-adjusted award” barring the award of
post-award interest can only be an award indexed for inflation as to the post-award
time. Indeed, post-award interest is intended to compensate the additional loss
incurred from the date of the award to the date of final payment. It bears no relation
to the manner in which the Tribunal assesses the damage at the time of the award.
From a logical point of view, the fact that the award will take into account the
inflation up to the date of the award is irrelevant for the possibility of awarding post-
award interest under Venezuelan law.

Having concluded that in the present case post-award interest is not precluded
under Venezuelan law, the Tribunal does not need to review whether Venezuelan
law should be disregarded on this point on the ground put forward by Aucoven that
“international law provides that interest runs until the date of effective payment”
(Cl. PHR, {| 349 referring to Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. (SPP) v.
Arab Republic of Egypt, \CSID Case Nr. ARB/84/3 (1992), Award, May 20, 1992, 3
ICSID Rep. 189 (1992), Cl. Auth. 31, at 244, ] 235).

The applicable interest rate

The parties disagree on the applicable interest rate. Aucoven relies on Clause 26 of
the Concession Agreement, which allows it to choose between two alternative
methods, the so-called “bank rate” method and the so-called “10 percent flat rate”**
Aucoven has chosen the bank rate method (Cl. PHB, I] 504-507), under which
“interest is calculated monthly at a rate equal to the average lending rate of the five
(5) principal Banks in the country, in accordance with the latest classification issued
by the Banco Central de Venezuela” (Clause 26 of the Concession Agreement, as
amended). Venezuela contends that the Tribunal should limit post-award interest to
3% per annum, which “is the maximum rate allowable in any circumstances under
the Venezuelan Civil Code, even when the claimant, like Aucoven in this case,
seeks an inflation-adjusted award” (Ven. PHR, p. 150). In support of its position,
Venezuela relies on the opinion of its legal expert, who testified that “[only] ‘legal
interest’ would be charged, which is three percent per year, as stated in the Article
1746 of the Civil Code”. Aucoven does not really dispute this, even if it emphasizes
that Dr. Badell does not substantiate his opinion (CI. PHB, {| 525).

Under the ‘10 percent flat rate’, “[t}he amount owed shall be equal to the sum of the amount owed plus the
‘Adjustment’ according to the definition of said term in Clause 26 of the Concession Agreement, plus
interest on unpaid balances, calculated monthly at an annual rate of 10%”.

102/113

383.

384.

385.

386.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Agreement contains a clear-cut contractual rule to
determine the interest rate. If Venezuela wishes this rate to be disregarded, it must
establish that Venezuelan law prohibits the contractual rate. Dr. Badell’s statement
that “[only] ‘legal interest’ would be charged” under Venezuelan law seems to imply
that the “legal interest” set in Article 1746 is mandatory (i.e., that it applies
irrespective of any contractually agreed interest rate). This does not correspond to
the wording of Article 1746 of the Venezuelan Civil Code. According to the
translation provided by Dr. Badell, this provision reads as follows (Authorities to
Badell Supp., at 28):

Article 1.746.- Interest is legal or contractual.
Legal interest is three percent per annum.

Contractual interest has no limits other than those designed by
special Law; unless, if not limited by Law, it exceeds by one half the
interest proven to be current interest at the time of the contracting, in
which case it shall be reduced by the Judge to said current interest,
if so requested by the debtor.

The contractual interest must be proven in writing when witness
testimony is not admissible as proof of the principal obligation. [...]
The plain text of this provision clearly shows that the “legal interest” of three percent
is not a mandatory rate. The only limits imposed by Venezuelan law are those set in
the third sentence of Article 1746. Venezuela invokes no limitation by virtue of
“special Law’, nor does it request a reduction of the rate on the ground that the
contractual interest exceeds by one half the current interest at the time of contract

conclusion.

Venezuela's further argument, according to which “[i]f the Tribunal departs from
Venezuelan law in this area, and instead relies on the recent ICSID decisions, a
reasonable post-award rate of interest to apply to the constant 1995-bolivar award
would be 6% per annum and not higher in any circumstances than 9% per annum”
is irrelevant, since the Tribunal does not depart from Venezuelan law as to the
applicable interest rate.

Finally, it should be recalled that “there is no rule of international law that would fix
the rate of interest or proscribe the limitations imposed by [domestic] law” (Southern
Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. (SPP) v. Arab Republic of Egypt, |CSID Case
Nr. ARB/84/3 (1992), Award, May 20, 1992, 3 ICSID Rep. 189 (1992), Cl. Auth. 31,
at 240, | 222). Accordingly, the Tribunal’s exclusive reliance on Venezuelan law is
justified.

103/113

387.

388.

3.1

389.

390.

On the basis of the foregoing developments, the Tribunal concludes that the
applicable interest rate is the rate calculated under the so-called “bank rate” method
that Aucoven chose according to Clause 26. Under such provision, this rate applies
to pre- and post-award interest equally.

Compound interest

The parties disagree on whether the Tribunal should award compound interest.
Aucoven argues that “[t]he Concession Agreement, Venezuelan law, and
international law all require the award of compound interest in this case” (CI. PHR,
] 331). Venezuela opposes Aucoven’s claim for compound interest, because it is not
founded under Venezuelan law and international law, and because it leads to a fully
unreasonable result.*? Since Aucoven argues that, even if Venezuelan law
prohibited compound interest (or in the absence of an express provision in the
Concession Agreement), international law mandating compound interest would
prevail over conflicting domestic law in accordance with Article 42(1) of the ICSID
Convention. The Tribunal will review the claim for compound interest, first, under
Venezuelan law and contractual terms and then under international law.

Does Venezuelan law allow for compound interest?

Relying upon the opinion of its legal expert Dr. Badell, Venezuela asserts that
compound interest cannot be granted under Venezuelan law, unless compounding
is “expressly” agreed by the parties. Aucoven states that the parties did so agree in
Clause 26 of the Agreement (“Under [this provision], interest is ‘calculated monthly’
on ‘unpaid balances’. Hence, if interest charges are not paid as they accrue, those

charges become part of the ‘unpaid balance’ for the following month”; Cl. PHR
7 332).

At the hearing, Aucoven’s legal expert was unable to confirm this contention (Tr.
800:19; 801:5). In reply to the question whether Clause 26 “reflected an intent to
capitalize”, Dr. Ortiz’s testimony was that he did not “want to say yes or no”. Even if
Dr. Badell’s expert testimony that “the contract does not refer to capitalizing interest

From a systematic point of view, Venezuela's contention refers solely to “pre-award” interest. However, its
argumentation on compound interest is more general and the Tribunal understands it so apply also to post-
award interest (Venezuela does not raise the argument in connection with post-award interest, since it
claims that post-award interest is precluded by law). This is at least implicitly recognized by Aucoven (see
for instance Cl. PHR, {] 33, note 29), where Aucoven refers to Venezuela’s argument in general terms
without distinguishing between pre- and post-award interest.

on a monthly basis” (Tr. 803:3-7 (Badell) and Badell Supp. {| 94) stands unrebutted
(Ven. PHB, p. 123), this is a matter of contract interpretation to which the Tribunal
must proceed in order to decide whether the language of Clause 26 reflects an
intent to apply compound interest.

Proceeding to interpret the Agreement, the Tribunal first observes that the words
“compound interest” or “compounding” do not appear in Clause 26 (Ven. PHB, p.
123). Admittedly, the lack of such words does not necessarily rule out an intent to
apply compound interest (Cl. PHR, {] 335). However, the Tribunal does not discern
such an intent in the wording of Clause 26. In reality, Venezuela’s argument that
“[t]he parties merely agreed that interest would be ‘calculated’ monthly based on the
changing annual interest rates of Venezuela’s five lending banks, as reported by the
Central Bank of Venezuela’, is in line with the language of Clause 26. In coming to
that conclusion, the Tribunal bears in mind that compound interest may have a very
significant economic impact, especially when high interest rates are applicable.
Therefore, in the Tribunal’s view, an agreement on compound interest must be
sufficiently clear and cannot be too easily implied. In the present case, the Tribunal
is unable to infer from Clause 26 of the Agreement that the parties ever reached a
clear agreement to apply compound interest.

Hence, Venezuelan law combined with the Agreement does not allow an award of
compound interest in the present case.

Does international law require an award of compound interest?

Aucoven submits that even in the absence of an express provision in the
Concession Agreement or even if Venezuelan law prohibited compound interest,
international law would require an award of compound interest (CI. PHR, J 338).
This submission is based on a recent ICSID award in which the tribunal awarded
compound interest notwithstanding Egyptian law to the contrary (Wena Hotels Ltd.
v. Egypt, ICSID Case Nr. ARB/98/4, Award, December 8, 2000, 41 I.L.M. 896, Ven.
Auth. 23, I] 128-129). Venezuela opposes the claims for compound interest, and in
particular points out that international jurisprudence has often refrained from
awarding compound interest when this appeared unreasonable under the

circumstances.

Wena upon which Aucoven relies was an expropriation case. In the other ICSID
precedent on which Aucoven bases its claim for compound interest (Compafia del
Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. Costa Rica I\CSID Case Nr. ARB/96/1 (2000),

105/113

reprinted in 4 ICSID Rev. — FILJ 170, Cl. Auth. 2, extensively cited in Cl. PHR,
340), the tribunal expressly drew a distinction between expropriation cases and
cases “of simple breach of contract’. It stated that “there is a tendency in
international jurisprudence to award only simple interest [...] in relation to cases of
L...] simple breach of contract” and found it necessary to emphasize that it was not
dealing with a case of contract breach but with an expropriation case.

These two ICSID precedents are sufficient in and of themselves to demonstrate that
there is no well established principle of international law requiring the award of
compound interest in the present case.“* The other cases cited by the parties
confirm this conclusion.

Aucoven’s submission that international law requires an award of compound interest
must thus be rejected.** Having concluded that the applicable Venezuelan law
combined with the pertinent contract provision does not allow compound interest
and that international law does not require it, the Tribunal can dispense with making
a determination on whether the specific circumstances of the case prevent an award
of compound interest in the present arbitration.

In conclusion, the Tribunal will not award compound interest.

Method of interest computation

The parties further disagree on the methodology for the computation of the interest.
Aucoven puts forward a calculation (i.e., revised Ex. 9 to Lakshmanan Supp.), to
which Venezuela objects that it involves double counting of inflation (Appendix C to
Ven. PHB, Ex. 6).

Aucoven replies that no double counting occurred since it computed interest as
follows: “[It] first converted amounts stated in 1995 bolivars to nominal bolivars as of
the due date. Nominal interest has then been applied for the period from the date
sixty days past the due date to January 1, 2003. For consistency, the resulting
nominal amount is then restated, or “deflated,” to 1995 bolivars” (Cl. PHR, {] 330).

See also O. SANDROCK, Compound Interest in International Arbitration, in: Etudes de procédure et
d'arbitrage en I'honneur de J.-F. Poudret, Lausanne, 1999, p. 537; J. ORTSCHEIDT, La réparation du
dommage dans I’arbitrage commercial international, Paris, 2001, n° 597 p. 275; N. AFFOLDER, Awarding
Compound Interest in International Arbitration, The American Review of International Arbitration 2001, pp.
68-69.

For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal emphasizes that international law does not prohibit compound interest
(see for instance AFFOLDER, cit., p. 69 and the cited authorities).

However, as Venezuela correctly points out, Aucoven’s financial expert agreed that
the contractual 5-bank interest rate chosen by Aucoven is a nominal rate, which
includes both a “real” interest component and a CPI component (Tr. 1198:8-19;
1201:15-1203:2; on cross-examination, Mr. Lakshmanan testified that in his opinion
the 5-bank rate “already include the inflation, so there is no need for further
adjustment for inflation in that rate” (Tr. 1210:2-8)).

Accordingly, the Tribunal holds that, for the sake of interest calculation, the amounts
awarded in 1995 bolivars should be converted into nominal bolivars as of the due
date. The 5-bank rate of interest should then be applied for the period from the date

on which interest is due to the date of payment.

Conclusion: Interest amounts due

In this Section, the Tribunal applies the foregoing considerations to each item of
claim awarded to Aucoven.

Pre-termination losses

Interest on pre-termination losses (i.e., losses incurred during the operating years
through March 31, 2000) starts to run on August 1, 2000.

Aucoven claims Bs. 118,722,000 for pre-termination losses (Cl. PHB, {| 458). The
Tribunal did not reduce this part of Aucoven’s out-of-pocket claim.

Accordingly, Aucoven is entitled to simple interest at the rate prescribed in the
Concession Agreement on Bs. 118,722,000 as of August 1, 2000 until effective

payment.
Post-termination losses

Interest on post-termination losses (i.e., losses incurred during the operating years
ending on March 31, 2001, and on August 31, 2002) starts to run on May 31, 2001
and 2002 and on October 31, 2002 on the amounts specified below.

Aucoven claims Bs. 394,848,000 for post-termination losses (Cl. PHR, {| 268). The
Tribunal did not reduce this part of Aucoven’s out-of-pocket claim. The total post-
termination loss of Bs. 394,848,000 derives from the addition of a net profit of Bs.
31,479,000 during the spending period from April 1, 2000 to March 31, 2001, a net
loss of Bs. 121,169,000 during the spending periods from April 1, 2001 to March 31,

2002 (Lakshmanan II, Revised Ex. 10), and a net loss of Bs. 242,200,000 during the
spending periods from April 1, to August 31, 2002 (App. 6 to Cl. PHB).

Accordingly, Aucoven is entitled to simple interest at the rate prescribed in the
Concession Agreement on Bs. 31,479,000 as of May 31, 2001, on
Bs. 121,169,000 as of May 31, 2002, and on Bs. 242,200,000 as of October 31,
2002, all until effective payment.

Pre-termination assets contributed

As previously noted, interest on pre-termination assets contributed (i.e., assets
contributed during the operating years through March 31, 2000) starts to run on
August 1, 2000.

Aucoven claims Bs. 2,398,561,000 for pre-termination assets contributed (i.e., for
“assets contributed to the Concession as of May 31, 2000”). The Tribunal
considered that Bs. 510,000,000 for non recoverable costs in connection with the
“Seconsa loan’, Bs. 117,900,000 for non recoverable legal fees, and Bs.
383,600,000 for non recoverable interest on short terms loans should be deducted
from Aucoven’s out-of-pocket claim for pre-termination assets contributed. Hence,
Aucoven’s out-of-pocket claim regarding “pre-termination assets contributed” on
which interest accrues amounts to Bs. 1,387,061,000.

Accordingly, Aucoven is entitled to simple interest at the rate prescribed in the
Concession Agreement on Bs. 1,387,061,000 as of August 1, 2000, until effective
payment.

Post-termination assets contributed

As previously noted, interest on post-termination assets contributed (i.e., assets
contributed for the period June 1, 2000 through August 31, 2002) starts to run on
November 1, 2002.

Aucoven claims Bs. 341,417,000 for post-termination assets contributed. The
Tribunal considered that Bs. 36,760,000 for non established net assets contributed
and Bs. 150,000,000 for non recoverable administrative costs should be deducted.
Hence, Aucoven’s out-of-pocket claim regarding “post-termination assets
contributed” on which interest accrues amounts to Bs. 154,657,000.

108/113

Accordingly, Aucoven is entitled to simple interest at the rate prescribed in the
Concession Agreement on Bs. 154,657,000 as to November 1, 2002, until
effective payment.

CURRENCY AND PAYMENT OF THE AWARD

In its pre-hearing submissions, Aucoven had sought an award stated in “B[olivars]s
(constant as of September 30, 1995) (that is augmented by an amount sufficient to
make the sum equal as of the date of payment to the stated amount on September
30, 1995) or converted to US dollars at the rate of Bs 170/US$ 1” (see Cl. Memorial
193; Cl. Reply, 221). Similarly, at the hearing, Aucoven submitted that “[a]ny
award here should be rendered either in dollars or constant bolivars that can be
immediately converted and in accord with the contract immediately expatriated at full
value” (Tr. 92:16-19).

Venezuela did not challenge the position pursuant to which a payment option
existed. It mentioned in its Rejoinder (p. 121, fn. 109) that Aucoven conceded that
the option be exercised by the Respondent and restated that it had the option in its
opening statement at the hearing (Tr. 99:1-5).

For the first time in its post-hearing submissions (Cl. PHB, {| 537; Cl. PHR, {| 377),
Aucoven requested the Tribunal to issue an award in dollars or a ruling on
repatriation and conversion at the most favorable rate in the following terms:

all amounts awarded Aucoven be converted into U.S. dollars at the

most favorable available exchange rate and be paid to a U.S. bank
account designated by Aucoven; or, in the alternative,

notwithstanding any Venezuelan law or regulation to the contrary,

Aucoven be permitted to repatriate freely and without encumbrance

or delay all amounts awarded and convert them into U.S. dollars at

the most favorable available exchange rate.
Emphasizing that Aucoven “abandons its prior position and advances [...] entirely
new propositions” “for the first time in its Post-Hearing Memorial’, Venezuela
considers that “there is no basis for such extraordinary action, particularly since
such action was not even suggested until after the hearing closed” (Ven. PHR, pp.
152, 153, and 155).

Aucoven advanced its new position in its first post-hearing submission (Cl. PHB, 7]
535). It did not expand on its reasons before the Post-Hearing Reply. Hence,
Venezuela had an opportunity to respond to the request as such, which it actually

109/113

420.

421.

422.

423.

424.

did, but not to comment on the different arguments which Aucoven put forward in its
second post-hearing submission. Neither did Venezuela have the opportunity to
tender legal or financial expert evidence nor to present oral argument on the issues
raised by Aucoven’s request.

Aucoven’s new submission did not only deprive Venezuela of the right to properly try
these issues. It is also contrary to Procedural Order N° 2, which required that the
parties “set out all facts and legal arguments on which they intend to rely” in the first
round of written submissions and that the second round be “limited to replies”.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal holds that Aucoven should not be allowed to
depart from its pre-hearing position, pursuant to which the amounts awarded in 1995
bolivars shall be “augmented by an amount sufficient to make the sum equal as of
the date of payment to the stated amount on September 30, 1995, or converted in
US dollars at the rate of Bs 170/US$1” (See Cl. Reply | 221). Hence, the Tribunal
does not need to discuss Venezuela’s argumentation in response.

As a result, the Arbitral Tribunal will order payment of the amounts awarded in
accordance with the terms of Aucoven’s request for relief as it stood at the time of
the hearing, being specified that such request can only be understood as giving the
award debtor the choice between the two possibilities of paying out on the award.

Costs

Aucoven argues that Venezuela should pay Aucoven’s costs and expenses,
including legal fees, incurred in connection with this arbitration (Cl. PHR, | 368),
while Venezuela submits that each party should bear its own arbitration costs and
fees or, should the Tribunal shift legal costs from one party to another, Aucoven
should then be ordered to reimburse the Republic for its legal costs and other
expenses of the arbitration (Ven. PHR, p. 152).

The parties concur that the Tribunal has discretion in matters of costs under Article
61(2) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal agrees with Aucoven that in exercising
its discretion the Tribunal should give effect to Clause 60(2) of the Concession
Agreement, which reflects a principle common to both Venezuelan and international
law, namely, that a party injured by a breach must be fully compensated for its
losses and damages, which include arbitration costs (Cl. PHR, {] 364). On the other

hand, the Tribunal also agrees with Venezuela that the “loser pays” principle is not

110/113

425.

absolute, in particular when the claimant succeeds only partially (Ven. PHR, pp.
150-151).

Considering all circumstances of this case, including in particular that Venezuela
breached the Concession Agreement; that it unsuccessfully challenged jurisdiction;
that Aucoven’s claim for lost profits, which was by far the largest one which required
the most efforts in terms of evidence and briefing, was not granted; that Aucoven
changed its economic analysis of lost profits at a late stage of the proceedings; the
Arbitral Tribunal deems it fair and reasonable that the cost burden be shared equally
between the parties each bearing its own legal expenses and 50 % of the arbitration

costs.
