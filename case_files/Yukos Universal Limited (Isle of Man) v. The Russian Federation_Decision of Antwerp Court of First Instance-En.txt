Court of first instance Antwerp, Department Antwerp, cabinet of the president — 16/2008/8 —

In the case with docket number 16/2008/B.

Considering the motivated application presented on 16 June 2016 by the TECHNICAL STATE
UNIVERSITY OF KALININGRAD, Sovietsky prospect 1, 236022 KALININGRAD (Russia),
hereinafter referred to as the Applicant, having as legal counsel Mr. Guy VAN DOSSELAERE,
attorney-at-law with address at 2018 ANTWERP, Justitiestraat 26, and Mr. Frank
ROOSENDAAL, attorney-at-law with address at 2000 ANTWERP, De Burburestraat 6.

Considering the law of 15 June 1935 on the use of languages in court cases.
Considering the particular regulations of the court.
Considering article 584 of the Judicial Code [BJC].

I Object of the claim and details of the case

With regard to the content of the claim and the factual details of the case, reference may be
made to the extensive application.

I. Assessment

The Applicant introduces its claim pursuant to article 18, second section B.J.C. and implicitly
article 584 B.J.C. The application of this article requires the necessary urgency and absolute
necessity, due to the fact that the procedure is exceptionally conducted on an ex parte basis.

The Applicant demonstrates, on the basis of the arguments raised in its application, in any
case an interest to introduce this application pursuant to article 584 B.J.C.

Article 18, second section B.J.C. permits the introduction of a claim to prevent the violation
of a seriously endangered right. This also is demonstrated sufficiently by the Applicant on
the basis of the elements in its application and the evidence submitted.

Considering the annulment of the arbitral awards of 30 November 2009 and 18 July 2014 by
the court of The Hague in the Netherlands on 20 April 2016, no attachments may in
principle be levied on the basis of these awards.

In the operative part [of its application], the Applicant demands this for one ship, whilst in
its argumentation it in fact demands this for two additional ships, one of which is neither
the property, nor at the disposal of the Applicant.

IN LIGHT OF THESE REASONS:

Ruling after examination and deliberation in chambers on the basis of a unilateral request
due to absolute necessity and urgency, pursuant to articles 18 and 584, first section B.J.C.

Declares the application admissible and well-founded to the following extent.
