INTRODUCTION

The Claimant in this arbitration is The Renco Group, Inc. (the “Claimant” or “Renco”), a legal
entity incorporated under the laws of the State of New York, the United States of America, with

its registered office at One Rockefeller Plaza, 29th Floor, New York, NY 10020, U.S.A.

The Claimant is represented in these proceedings by Mr. Edward Kehoe, Ms. Isabel Fernandez
de la Cuesta, Mr. Aloysius Llamzon, Mr. Cedric Soule, and Mr. David Weiss of King & Spalding
LLP, 1185 Av. of the Americas, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10036, U.S.A.

The Respondent is the Republic of Peru (the “Respondent” or “Peru”).

The Respondent is represented in these proceedings by Mr. Jonathan Hamilton, Ms. Andrea
Menaker, and Mr. Francisco Jijén, of White & Case LLP, 701 Thirteenth Street, NW Washington,
D.C. 20005-3807, U.S.A.

A dispute has arisen between the Claimant and Respondent (collectively, the “Parties’)
concerning the Claimant’s alleged investment in Doe Run Peru S.R.LLTDA, a company
incorporated under the laws of Peru. According to the Claimant, the Government of Peru breached
the Trade Promotion Agreement between the Republic of Peru and the United States of America,
dated 12 April 2006, entered into force on 1 February 2009 (hereafter, the “Treaty”), with respect
to the Claimant’s investment, causing damages to the Claimant.' The Respondent denies the

Claimant’s allegations as to the violations of the Treaty and damages in their entirety.”

The merits of such allegations are not the subject of the present decision. This decision addresses
certain preliminary matters, namely the Respondent's application of 20 December 2019 that the
Tribunal dismiss the Claimant’s claims pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty on the basis that

the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over them.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Commencement of the Arbitration and Constitution of the Tribunal

On 12 August 2016, the Claimant served upon the Government of the Republic of Peru two
notices of its intention to submit a claim to arbitration (the “Notices of Intent”) to bring
arbitration proceedings against the Respondent, one under the Treaty and the other containing
related claims arising under the Contract of Stock Transfer executed on 23 October 1997 (the
“Stock Transfer Agreement”), and the Guaranty Agreement executed on 21 November 1997

(the “Guaranty Agreement’).

On 10 November 2016, 90 days following the Respondent’s receipt of the two Notices of Intent,
the Parties executed a Consultation Agreement. On 14 March 2017, the Parties executed a
subsequent Framework Agreement to facilitate the negotiated settlement of the disputes during a
specific timeframe. The Framework Agreement was first extended to 31 March 2018 and
subsequently extended indefinitely until 10 October 2018 when the Respondent informed the

Claimant of its intent to terminate the Agreement.

By Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated 23 October 2018 (“Notice of Arbitration
and Statement of Claim”), the Claimant commenced arbitration proceedings against the
Respondent, pursuant to Article 10.16 of the Treaty and Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules.

In its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, the Claimant appointed Professor Horacio A.

Grigera Na6n as the first arbitrator. Professor Grigera NaGn’s contact details are as follows:

On 10 June 2019, Renco, Doe Run Resources Corporation, Peru, and Activos Mineros S.A.C.
executed a Procedural Agreement (the “Procedural Agreement”), by which the Parties agreed
that (i) the instant arbitration would be coordinated with the arbitration brought under the Stock
Transfer Agreement and Guaranty Agreement, The Renco Group, Inc. and Doe Run Resources
Corp. v. Republic of Peru and Activos Mineros S.A.C., PCA Case No. 2019-47 (“Renco HI” or
the “Contract Case”), (ii) the same tribunal would be constituted to hear both arbitrations, and
(iii) both arbitrations would be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law (as revised in 2010, with new article 1,

paragraph 4, as adopted in 2013) (the “UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules”).

By letter dated 17 October 2019, the Parties appointed as presiding arbitrator Judge Bruno Simma,

whose contact details are as follows:

The Netherlands

On 3 December 2019, the Parties agreed to the administration of the proceedings by the

Permanent Court of Arbitration (the “PCA”).

The Respondent’s Preliminary Objections

On 4 December 2019, the Respondent submitted a two-page letter dated 3 December 2019, by
which it “notifie[d] its request for the Tribunal to decide on an expedited basis certain objections
that the dispute is not within the Tribunal’s competence”, pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the

Treaty. The Respondent’s letter reads in full as follows:

The Parties to the referenced proceedings have agreed to hold a procedural session on January
14, 2020, with respect to (1) The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru (the “Treaty Case”).
and (2) The Renco Group, Inc. and Doe Run Resources Corp. v. Republic of Peru and Activos
Mineros S.A.C. (the “Contract Case”) (collectively, the “Cases” or the “Arbitrations”). The
Parties, through counsel, are engaged in ons related to comprehensive procedural
agreements. In this context, Respondents, as applicable, hereby give notice regarding certain
objections, and will continue discussions regarding procedural matters, including with
respect to such objections.

 

 

 

 
  

   

A. Treaty Case

With respect to the Treaty Case, in its initial Response dated January 14, 2019, although
under no obligation to do so and subject to a reservation of rights, Respondent referenced
various jurisdictional objections, including without limitation that the claims were precluded
because they do not meet temporal requirements. Respondent hereby notifies its request for

 

 

PCA Case No. 2019-46
Decision on Expedited Preliminary Objections
Page 4 of 75

 

the Tribunal to decide on an expedited basis certain objections that the dispute is not within
the Tribunal’s competence, pursuant to the Peru-United States Trade Promotion Agreement
(the “Treaty”).

 

Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty provides as follows:

In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is
constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under
paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's
competence. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and
issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no
later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party
requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the
decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal
may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award
by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days.

    
   

 

 

 

Respondent's objections directly relate to the Tribunal’s competence, which is subject to
rigid temporal requirements. Pursuant to Article 10.1.3, “this Chapter does not bind any Party
in relation to any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the
date of entry into force of this Agreement.” Here, the Treaty entered into force on February
1, 2009. In addition, pursuant to Article 10.18.1, “[nJo claim may be submitted to arbitration
under the Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant
first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article
10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the
enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage.” Here,
Claimant filed its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim in the Treaty Case (the
“Treaty Statement of Claim’) on October 23, 2018. The Parti 0 have entered into certain
relevant agreements.! [FN1: See, e.g., Framework Agreement (as Amended), March 14, 2017
(Doc. R-10).]

 

 

 

 

Taking into account the foregoing, as Respondent will plead in further detail, Claimant’s
claims do not meet the Treaty’s temporal requirements. As set forth in the Treaty Statement
of Claim, the measures that Claimant alleges to have breached the Treaty occurred either
before the Treaty’s entry into force and Claimant first acquired or should have first acquired,
knowledge concerning a breach and loss or damage arising therefrom before the relevant
prescription period. To the extent that the Treaty Statement of Claim references allegations
that arose after the relevant time period, claims based thereon appear to be impermissible as
well for related reasons. To the extent that Claimant argues, despite the Treaty, that
Respondent should not be allowed to make such objections, Respondent will address such
argument at the appropriate time.

 

B. Contract Case

With respect to the Contract Case, in the initial Response to the Notice of Arbitration and
Statement of Claim in the Contract Arbitration dated January 14, 2019, although under no
obligation to do so and subject to a reservation of rights, Respondents referenced deficiencies
and set forth certain threshold objections, including without limitation with respect to the
ant parties and scope of the agreement to arbitrate. Respondents seek to be heard on
ue as a preliminary matter in the Contract Case in order to resolve or define the scope
of the proceeding.

  

C. Procedural Implications

Counsel to the Parties have been engaged in discussions regarding procedural matters and
have agreed to continue such discussions with respect to the foregoing in the days ahead.

Respondents will continue to endeavor to advance on procedural matters before the
anticipated procedural session. For the avoidance of doubt, Respondents reserve the right to
articulate and expand upon the issues set forth herein at the appropriate time in accordance
with applicable instruments, laws and rules, and reserve all rights with respect to these
proceedings.>

 

On 6 December 2019, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit its comments in respect of the

Respondent's letter.

By letter dated 10 December 2019, the Claimant asserted that “Respondent’s December 3, 2019
communication does not satisfy the pleading requirements necessary to trigger the application of
Article 10.20.5 of the [Treaty]. Accordingly, Claimant respectfully requests that the Tribunal find
that Peru has failed to—and can no longer—invoke the expedited review procedure under Article
10.20.5 of the Treaty.”* In the alternative, the Claimant proposed a schedule for written

submissions and a hearing on the Respondent’s preliminary objections.

On 17 December 2019, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to submit a Memorial by 20
December 2019 “setting forth its Article 10.20.5 objections in full, with all supporting evidence
and legal authorities” and provided the Claimant until 21 February 2020 to submit a Counter-

Memorial responding to the Respondent’s objections.

On 20 December 2019, the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Preliminary Objections under

Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty (the “Memorial on Preliminary Objections’).

On 2 January 2020, the PCA, acting on behalf of the Tribunal, circulated drafts of the Terms of

Appointment and Procedural Order No. 1 for the Parties’ comments.

On 10 January 2020, the Parties submitted their joint comments on the Draft Terms of
Appointment and Draft Procedural Order No. 1, together with a proposed intermediate timetable
to the Tribunal. The Claimant proposed that the Tribunal establish the procedural calendar for the
entire arbitration, while the Respondent proposed that the procedural calendar for additional
phases, if any, be established following a Hearing on Article 10.20.5 Objections and Bifurcation.

The Parties also agreed to the appointment of Dr. Heiner Kahlert as Assistant to the Tribunal.

On 14 January 2020, a first procedural meeting was held via telephone conference during which
the Parties agreed, and the Tribunal confirmed, that the procedural calendar for subsequent

phases, if any, would be decided at the conclusion of the initial phase.

On 19 January 2020, having considered the Parties’ comments, the Tribunal circulated revised

drafts of the Terms of Appointment and Procedural Order No. | to the Parties.

Procedural Order No. 1.

On 3 February 2020, the Tribunal issued the Terms of Appointment and Procedural Order No. 1.

On 21 February 2020, the Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on Article 10.20.5

Objections (the “Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections”).

On 27 February 2020, following consultation with the Parties as to their availability, the Tribunal
set the date of 13 June 2020 for a Hearing on Article 10.20.5 Objections in Washington, D.C.

On 7 March 2020, the United States of America (the “US”) made a non-disputing State party

submission (the “NDP Submission’).

On 20 March 2020, the Parties each submitted their respective comments on the US non-disputing
State party submission (the “Respondent’s C on NDP ission” and the

 

“Claimant’s Comments on NDP Submission”, respectively).

Hearing on Preliminary Objections

By respective letters dated 15 May 2020, the Parties proposed that the Hearing on Preliminary
Objections take place by videoconference over two days rather than in person in Washington,

D.C.

On 19 May 2020, the Tribunal confirmed that the Hearing on Preliminary Objections would take
place by videoconference on 12-13 June 2020 and circulated a Draft Procedural Order No. 2

concerning the organization of the hearing for the Parties’ comments.

By their respective communications of 28 May, 1 June, and 2 June 2020, the Parties submitted

their comments on Draft Procedural Order No. 2.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Background of the Dispute

The instant dispute arises with respect to Renco’s alleged investment in Doe Run Peru S.R.LTDA
(“DRP”), a mining and mineral processing company incorporated under the laws of Peru, which

in 1997 acquired a smelting and refining complex in La Oroya, Peru (the “Facility”).°

In the early 1990s, Peru decided to privatize the Facility, which at that time was held by State-

owned Empresa Minera Del Centro Del Pert S.A. (“Centromin”).°

In January 1997, in accordance with extant Peruvian environmental regulations, Centromin had
prepared, and the Ministry of Energy and Mines (“MEM”) adopted, an Environmental
Remediation and Management Program (Programa de Adecuacién y Manejo Ambiental, or
“PAMA”) to govern the future operation of the Facility.’ The PAMA devised a series of
environmental projects “aimed at remediating, mitigating, and preventing environmental
degradation to be completed over a period of ten years”.* The PAMA included sixteen projects
with a ten-year deadline.’ Following MEM’s adoption of the PAMA, Centromin transferred its
interest in the Facility to a newly-established State-owned entity, Empresa Minera Metaloroya La

Oroya S.A. (“Metaloroya”), created to facilitate the privatization of the Facility.'°

On 10 July 1997, Renco and its affiliate, Doe Run Resources Corporation (“DRRC”), were
awarded a public tender for Metaloroya. To facilitate the acquisition of the Facility, they

established DRP and DRP acquired the Facility pursuant to the Stock Transfer Agreement of 23

October 1997 and DRP’s subsequent merger with Metaloroya on 30 December 1997.'! The
acquisition was predicated on shared, but distinct, responsibilities between DRP and Centromin
with respect to the PAMA established to mitigate existing environmental issues associated with

the Facility.'?

On 19 October 1999,'* 10 April 2001,"4 25 January 2002,'° and 29 May 2006,'° DRP requested
and was granted modifications and extensions with respect to the requirements set out in the

PAMA.

Beginning in 2007, certain plaintiffs, residents of La Oroya, brought suit against various
defendants, including Renco and DRRC, in United States courts, seeking damages for personal
injury arising from alleged exposure to toxic substances and environmental contamination from

the Facility.'”

On | February 2009, the Trade Promotion Agreement between the Republic of Peru and the

United States of America entered into force.

On 5 March 2009, DRP requested—and on 10 March 2009, MEM rejected—an extension to

complete the final of the sixteen PAMA-mandated projects. '*

On 23 March 2009, the Government of Peru and DRP concluded a Memorandum of
Understanding that an extension to complete the final PAMA project would be provided to Doe

Run Peru.’* The Respondent never signed the Memorandum.
On 3 June 2009, DRP closed the Facility.””

In September 2009, the Peruvian Congress passed a law granting DRP an extension of 30 months
to complete the final PAMA project. According to the Claimant, despite this legislation, MEM
repeatedly refused to provide an extension for the completion of the final PAMA project,
obstructed DRP’s ability to secure financing, and launched a “smear campaign” against Renco

and DRP to damage DRP’s reputation and prevent it from security financing.”!

In February 2010, DRP’s creditors placed DRP into involuntary bankruptcy before Peru’s
National Institute for the Defence of Free Competition and the Protection of Intellectual Property

(INDECOPI”).”?

On 16 August 2010, INDECOPI publicly announced the commencement of DRP’s bankruptcy,

guided by a board of creditors.”*

On 14 September 2010, MEM asserted a US$ 163 million claim as creditor against DRP on the
basis of DRP’s “unfulfilled PAMA investments”. The credit claim endowed MEM with one

third of all voting rights on the board of creditors.”>

The Renco I Arbitration

On 4 April 2011, Renco and DRP commenced arbitration proceedings against Peru pursuant to
Chapter 10 of the Treaty, asserting substantially identical claims as Renco puts forward in this
arbitration (“Renco I’). In their Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, Renco and DRP

made the following waiver:

Finally, as required by Article 10.18(2) of the Treaty, Renco and its affiliate DRP waive their
right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any
Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure
alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16, except for proceedings for interim
entitled to relief, not involving payment of monetary damages, before a judicial or
administrative tribunal of Peru. To the extent that the Tribunal may decline to hear any claims

On 9 August 2011, Renco submitted an Amended Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim
in Renco I, in which it withdrew DRP as second claimant and made the following waiver in

equivalent terms as in its prior Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim:

Finally, as required by Article 10.18(2) of the Treaty, Renco waives its right to initiate or
continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other
dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to
constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16, except for proceedings for interim entitled to
relief, not involving payment of monetary damages, before a judicial or administrative

herein on jurisdictional or issibility grounds, Claimant reserves the right to bring such

other forum for resolution on the merits.* [Emphasis added.]

 

 

 

       

cl:

On 3 October 2014, Peru raised an objection to the Renco J tribunal’s jurisdiction based on
Renco’s failure to properly fulfil the waiver requirement established in Article 10.18.2 of the

Treaty.**

On 15 July 2016, the tribunal in Renco / issued a Partial Award dismissing Renco’s claims for
lack of jurisdiction on account of the reservation of rights contained in Renco’s waiver rendering
it non-compliant with the requirements of Article 10.18.2 of the Treaty.* The tribunal further

held as follows:

The Tribunal has concluded that Renco failed to comply with the formal requirement of
Article 10.18(2) and that it has no power to allow Renco to cure this defect (as noted above,
one member of the Tribunal did not join in this conclusion) or to sever the reservation of
rights. However, the consequences for Renco may be extreme in the following scenario. If
Renco should decide to file a new Notice of Arbitration accompanied by a “clean” waiver,
Peru may be minded to argue that Renco’s claims have become time-barred because more
than three years have elapsed since Renco first acquired knowledge of the breaches alleged
under Article 10.16(1) of the Treaty.

In these circumstances, while the possible operation of a 3 year time bar on the facts of this
case cannot change the analysis of Article 10.18(2)(b) the analysis must be the same,
even if the objection had been raised at the outset of the arbitration), the question which arises
is whether Peru’s conduct with regard to the late raising of its waiver objection rises to the
level of an abuse of rights. The test to be applied is whether Peru has sought to raise this
objection for an improper motive or — as Renco puts it, whether Peru is seeking to evade its
duty to arbitrate Rencs laims under the Treaty rather than ensure that its waiver rights are
respected or that the waiver provision’s objectives are served.

Having considered the issue with great care, the Tribunal has concluded that, in raising its
waiver objection, Peru has sought to vindicate its right to receive a waiver which complies
with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2)(b) and a waiver which does not undermine
the object and purpose of that Article. In so finding, the Tribunal does not accept the
contention that Peru’s waiver objection is tainted by an ulterior motive to evade its duty to
arbitrate Renco’s claims. Indeed, Peru has no duty to arbitrate Renco’s claims under the
Treaty unless Renco submits a waiver which complies with Article 10.18(2)(b).

  
 

 

In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal does not wish to rule out the possibility that an abuse
of rights might be found to exist if Peru were to argue in any future proceeding that Renco’s
claims were now time-barred under Article 10.18(1). To date, Peru has suffered no material
prejudice as a result of the reservation of rights in Renco’s waiver. However, Renco would
suffer material prejudice if Peru were to claim in any subsequent arbitration that Renco’s
claims were now time-barred under Article 10.18(1).

While this Tribunal cannot prevent Peru from exercising in the future what it then considers
to be its legal rights, the Tribunal can, and it does, admonish Peru to bear in mind, if that
scenario should arise, Renco’s submission that Peru’s conduct with respect to its late raising
of the waiver objection constitutes an abuse of rights. In the unanimous view of the Tribunal,
justice would be served if Peru accepted that time stopped running for the purposes of Article
10.18(1) when Renco filed its Amended Notice of Arbitration on August 9, 2011.55

KEY LEGAL PROVISIONS

The Treaty was signed on 12 April 2006 and entered into force on 1 February 2009.

Articles 10.20.4, 10.20.5, and 10.20.6 of the Treaty pertain to preliminary objections by

respondent parties:

Article 10.20

Conduct of the Arbitration

 

4. Without prejudice to a tribunal's authority to address other objections
as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not
within the tribunal’s competence, a tribunal shall address and decide as
a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter
of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of
the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.

     

(a) Such objection shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as
possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than
the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-
memorial (or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of
arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit

its response to the amendment).

    

 

(b) On receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall
suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for
considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has

blished for considering any other preliminary question, and

ie a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds
therefor.

 
  

(

e

In deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall
assume to be true claimant's factual allegations in support of any
claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment thereof) and,
in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the
statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any relevant
facts not in dispute.

(d) The respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or
any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or
did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the
expedited procedure set out in paragraph 5.

5. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the
tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis
objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not
within the tribunal’s competence. The tribunal shall suspend any
proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the
objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after
the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing,
the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or

Decision on Expedited Preliminary Objections
Page 17 of 75

award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on
a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by
an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days.

 

 

6. When it decides a respondent’s objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the
tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party
reasonable costs and attorney’s fees incurred in submitting or opposing
the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the
tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant's claim or the
respondent's objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing
parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.

Article 10.1.3 establishes a non-retroactivity requirement:

Article 10.1.3
Scope and Coverage

3. For greater certainty, this Chapter does not bind any Party in relation to
any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before
the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

Article 10.18 establishes limitations on the Contracting Parties’ consent to arbitration, including

a temporal prescription:

Article 10.18
Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party

1. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than
three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first
acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged
under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought
under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under
Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage.

Pursuant to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “VCLT”),”? the foregoing

provisions of the Treaty are to be interpreted as follows:

Article 28
Non-retroactivity of treaties

Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise
established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which

 

Peru is a party to the VCLT. While the US is not, it has recognized since at least 1971 that the Convention
is the “authoritative guide” to treaty law and practice. NDP Submission, n. 13 referring to Letter from
Secretary of State Rogers to President Nixon transmitting the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,
October 18, 1971, reprinted in 65 DEP’T ST. BULL. 684, 685 (1971).

took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry
into force of the treaty with respect to that party.

LJ
Article 31
General rule of interpretation

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the
light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise,
in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all
the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in
connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the
other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

 

 

(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which
establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its
interpretation;

(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations
between the parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the
parties so intended.

Article 32
Supplementary means of interpretation

1. Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including
the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion,
in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article
31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to
article 31:

(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or

(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

70. In addition, the Treaty is to be applied in accordance with the rules set forth in the International
Law Commission Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the

“ILC Articles on State Responsibility”), Articles 13 and 14 of which read as follows:

Article 13

International obligation in force for a State

PCA Case No. 2019-46
Decision on Expedited Preliminary Objections
Page 19 of 75

An act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international
obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the
act occurs.

Article 14
Extension in time of the breach of an international obligation

The breach of an international obligation by an act of a State not having a
continuing character occurs at the moment when the act is performed,
even if its effects continue.

2. The breach of an international obligation by an act of a State having a
continuing character extends over the entire period during which the act
continues and remains not in conformity with the international obligation.

The breach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a
given event occurs when the event occurs and extends over the entire
period during which the event continues and remains not in conformity
with that obligation.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

Summary of Respondent’s Preliminary Objections

The Respondent raises preliminary objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in accordance with
procedures established under Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty, which provides an expedited
mechanism for resolving disputes as to a tribunal’s competence. The Respondent raises its
objections pursuant to Articles 10.1.3 and 10.18.1 of the Treaty, requesting that the Tribunal

dismiss these proceedings in their entirety.**

First, the Respondent raises an objection under Article 10.1.3 (“Scope and Coverage”) of the
Treaty, which precludes any Party from raising claims relating “to any act or fact that took place
or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of [the Treaty]”.*
Secondly, the Respondent raises an additional objection under Article 10.18.1 (“Conditions and
Limitations on Consent of Each Party”) of the Treaty, which precludes a claimant from raising
claims later than three years following “the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should
have acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged” and knowledge that the claimant “has incurred
loss or damage”. In the present case, the Respondent submits that this prescription period bars
any claims by the Claimant under the Treaty based on alleged breaches arising before 13
November 2013, even if construed “in the manner most favorable to Claimant”.**

The Respondent asserts that the Claimant raises its claims in violation of the aforementioned
Treaty provisions, contending that, in its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, the
Claimant has alleged only facts which predate the entry into force of the Treaty or the earliest
dates for which claims would not be prescribed. Consequently, the Respondent argues that all
three of the Claimant’s claims violate the Treaty’s temporal requirements and should be

dismissed.“*

Additionally, the Respondent submits that the Claimant failed to adhere to Treaty requirements

in Renco I, resulting in its dismissal, and is not entitled, in the present proceedings, “to benefit

from its improper submission of claims [in Renco I] to improperly extend the prescription

period”.””

Respondent’s Request for Relief

In its Memorial on Preliminary Objections, Respondent requests that the Tribunal find that
“Renco has [...] violated the Treaty and failed to establish the requirements for Peru’s consent to
arbitrate under the Treaty” and “render an award dismissing Renco’s claims, with an award of

costs in favor of Peru, and such further and other relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.”“*

Summary of Claimant’s Position on Respondent’s Preliminary Objections

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s preliminary objections in their entirety.

First, the Claimant contends that the Respondent failed to properly invoke the expedited review
procedure available under Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty. The Claimant advances that “Article
10.20.5 requires a respondent to make and brief its objections within 45 days of the tribunal’s
constitution” and that this deadline fell on 3 December 2019.” According to the Claimant, the
Respondent’s 3 December 2019 Letter to the Tribunal was insufficient to trigger the expedited
review mechanism as it provided only a “vague and unclear” notice of intent to raise “certain
objections” and was “devoid of any factual bases or legal analysis”.*° Consequently, the Claimant

submits that the Respondent’s objections are inadmissible.

Secondly, the Claimant advances that the Respondent’s objections arising under Article 10.1.3,
that the Claimant’s claims are “deeply rooted” in facts and acts predating the entry into force of
the Treaty and therefore fall outside of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, are meritless.*' The Claimant
contends that each of its claims arises out of facts and events that occurred during or after March

2009 and therefore do not violate the non-retroactivity principle.**

Page 22 of 75

Thirdly, the Claimant contends that the Respondent’s objections that the Claimant’s claims are
time-barred by the three-year prescription period under Article 10.18.1 lack merit. The Claimant
notes that the text of the Article is silent on whether the pendency of timely arbitration
proceedings suspends the time limitation period with respect to any later resubmission to
arbitration following a dismissal without prejudice. However, according to the Claimant, a “good
faith interpretation” of the Article in accordance with principles of the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties “leads to the undeniable conclusion that the three year limitations period under

Article 10.18.1 was suspended during the pendency of the Renco J arbitration”.*>

Fourthly, the Claimant argues, in the alternative, that the Respondent is not entitled to rely on its
Article 10.18.1 objections because, in light of its conduct in Renco J, its objections constitute an
“abuse of rights”.*! The Claimant emphasizes that, despite multiple opportunities to raise its
waiver objection throughout the proceedings, Peru waited three and a half years to raise this
objection. The Claimant further points out that the Renco J tribunal unanimously condemned this
conduct as prejudicial to the Claimant should the Respondent proceed to raise a prescription

defence in subsequent arbitration proceedings.»

Finally, the Claimant advances that its denial of justice claim is not time-barred. According to
the Claimant, it is “well settled that a denial of justice claim arises when local remedies are
exhausted”.*° Therefore, the Claimant submits that the breach underpinning the claim did not
occur until 3 November 2015, within three years of the initiation of this arbitration, when the
Supreme Court of Peru denied DRP’s appeal with respect to its claims that the Ministry of Energy
and Mines asserted an improper US$ 163 million credit against DRP when it entered

bankruptcy.*”

THE NON-DISPUTING PARTY SUBMISSION

On 7 March 2020, the US, as a non-disputing State party to the Treaty, made a written submission
pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the Treaty. The US notes that it does not take a position on how its
interpretation of the relevant Treaty provisions applies to the facts of this case and that “no

inference should be drawn from the absence of comment on any issue not addressed”.

First, the US proffers its interpretation of Article 10.18.1, according to which the limitation period
within which a claimant must bring a claim is three years after the date on which “claimant first

acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach”.

The US avers that the Claimant bears the burden of proof to establish jurisdiction and must present
relevant facts to establish that each of its claims falls within the three-year period.*! Additionally,
the US describes this limitation period as “clear and rigid”, not to be modified by any “suspension,
prolongation or other qualification”, and that the knowledge that triggers the limitation period can

only occur on a single date, when the breach first occurs.°

The US defines knowledge of “incurred loss or damage” to mean knowledge of the existence of
such loss or damage, even if it cannot be quantified until a later date, and “incur” to mean “to

become liable or subject to”, which includes losses or damages that are not immediate.”

The US defines “breach” as an act of a State “not in conformity with what is required of it by that
obligation”, and because responsibility of a State cannot be invoked for non-final judicial acts
unless domestic remedies are “obviously futile or manifestly ineffective” then “non-final judicial
acts have not ripened into the type of final act that is sufficiently definite to implicate state
responsibility”.® As such, the US submits that the three-year limitation period does not begin to
run until the date the “claimant acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge that either the

breach has occurred—i.e., when all available domestic remedies have been exhausted, unless

obviously futile or manifestly ineffective—or the claimant or enterprise has incurred loss or

damage, whichever is later.”

89. Secondly, in relation to non-retroactivity under Article 10.1.3 of the Treaty, the US states that a
State’s conduct prior to entry into force of the Treaty may be relevant to determining if said State
breached an obligation, but that there must exist conduct after the date of entry into force that

itself constitutes a breach. Pre-entry into force conduct alone, even if left unremedied, does not

suffice.”

THE TRIBUNAL’S REASONING

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed all of the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties
during the preliminary phase of these proceedings. Although the Tribunal may not address all
such arguments and evidence in full detail in its reasoning below, the Tribunal has nevertheless

considered and taken them into account in arriving at its decision.

The Sufficiency of Respondent’s Submissions to Trigger the Article 10.20.5 Expedited
Review Mechanism
Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty provides that a respondent wishing to exercise the expedited review

mechanism must so request no later than 45 days after the constitution of the tribunal.

On 19 October 2019, Judge Simma accepted his appointment as President of the Tribunal and the

Tribunal was fully constituted, triggering the Article 10.20.5 time limits.”

On 3 December 2019, forty-five days following Judge Simma’s appointment as President of the
Tribunal, the Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal in which it gave “notice regarding certain

objections”.”°

The Claimant contends that the Respondent’s 3 December 2019 letter to the Tribunal failed to
satisfy the requirements to trigger the Article 10.20.5 expedited review mechanism as the
Respondent did not provide the necessary factual bases or legal analysis to invoke this review
procedure until it submitted its Memorial on Preliminary Objection on 20 December 2019.’! On
the other hand, the Respondent argues that its “notice” was all that was required to trigger the

Article 10.20.5 expedited review mechanism.

Claimant’s position
The Claimant argues that the Respondent’s 3 December 2019 letter failed to trigger the expedited
review mechanism, because it failed to clearly articulate its objections and their legal bases.”

Rather, according to the Claimant, the Respondent’s letter provided only “vague notice of

objections”.”* The Claimant contends that, as a result of this failure, the Respondent is unable

now to avail itself of this expedited review procedure.”

The Claimant contends that the Respondent mischaracterizes the Claimant’s position and clarifies
that it does not argue that, in order to trigger the Article 10.20.5 mechanism, the Respondent was
required to submit a full Memorial, but rather that the Respondent failed to meet even the lower
bar required for a “request” for such proceedings.” To this end, the Claimant emphasizes that the
Respondent’s 3 December 2019 letter “giv[ing] notice regarding certain objections” did not
constitute a “request” to trigger the expedited review mechanism under Article 10.20.5 of the

Treaty.”°

The Claimant submits that, according to an interpretation of Article 10.20.5 “in good faith and in
accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms, in the context of the Treaty as a whole”,”” the
Respondent was required to make a request that clearly articulated and briefed its objections.”*
The Claimant notes that the provision “does not establish a procedure by which the respondent
may give notice of an objection before submitting it to the tribunal”, but rather requires the
Respondent to issue its request for expedited review of its objections within a narrow time limit

of 45 days, upon which the Tribunal is thereafter required to issue a decision within 150 days.”

Relying on the finding in Feldman v. Mexico, the Claimant argues that “delivery of a notice of
intent to submit a claim to arbitration does not satisfy the requirement of having to ‘make a
claim’.”*° The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contention that there exists a fundamental
difference between initiating an arbitration and issuing an objection in an already initiated

arbitration. According to the Claimant, in either event, a Party raising an objection must provide

a basis for the objection it submits.*! The Claimant further notes that, when the Respondent has
previously filed objections under expedited review mechanisms analogous to the Article 10.20.5
mechanism, it briefed its objections clearly and within the limitation period, as required.*? The
Claimant notes that the US NDP Submission did not contradict this interpretation of Article

10.20.5.88

In addition, the Claimant contends that it would be “severely prejudiced” should the Respondent
be able to trigger the expedited review “without actually submitting its objections to the tribunal
for decision” as the Article requirements already shorten the amount of time within which the
Claimant must respond to the Respondent’s objections and the Tribunal must issue its decision —
a total of 150 days from the Respondent’s request.*! The Claimant argues that the drafters of the
Treaty would not have “intended to give the respondent such an unfair procedural advantage” in

a review mechanism that may result in the dismissal of the Claimant's entire case.**

The Claimant proffers that it was not until the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Preliminary
Objections on 20 December 2019, more than two weeks following the expiry of the limitation
period, that it fully presented its objections.*° The Claimant additionally notes that the Respondent
had more than one year to prepare an adequate submission to trigger the Article 10.20.5
procedure, since the Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim on 23

October 2018.*”

Finally, the Claimant argues that the object and purpose of Article 10.20.5 supports its
interpretation of the provision’s language. Referring to Jin Hae Seo v. Republic of Korea, the
Claimant notes that the US explained that clauses identical to Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty were
included in all of its recent trade agreements in order “to efficiently and cost-effectively address

certain preliminary objections”.** The Claimant submits that the object and purpose of the

provision therefore supports the requirement that the Respondent “is meant to submit and fully

brief all of its objections within the 45-day deadline”.*°

Respondent’s position

The Respondent submits that, in its 3 December 2019 letter to the Tribunal, the Respondent
requested that the Tribunal decide on its preliminary objections in accordance with the expedited
review procedure available under Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty.°” According to the Respondent,
the language of the provision requires only that the Respondent submit a “request” within the
prescribed period in order to invoke the expedited review mechanism. The Respondent submits
that the language in its 3 December 2019 letter to the Tribunal clearly indicates that it was issuing

such a request, stating that “Respondent hereby notifies its request for the Tribunal to decide on

an expedited basis certain objections that the dispute is not within the Tribunal’s competence”.*!

The Respondent contends that the Claimant errs in arguing that the Respondent is required to
submit a full brief in the first instance in order to trigger Article 10.20.5 procedures. According
to the Respondent, no language indicating that a full brief is required is present in the Treaty

text.”

The Respondent submits that the RDC v. Guatemala case, upon which the Claimant relies,
actually cuts in favour of the Respondent, as in that case Guatemala successfully initiated

expedited review of its preliminary objections by first filing a three-page letter containing its

Claimant’s Letter to the Tribunal, 10 December 2019, p. 3 (C-14). The Claimant further highlights that in
a number of cases within which the expedited review mechanism, identical to that available under the
Treaty, was exercised, the respondents in those cases fully briefed all of their objections within the 45-day
deadline. See Claimant’s Letter to the Tribunal, 10 December 2019, p. 3 (C-14), referring to Jin Hae Seo

request and submitting a full brief thereafter.°> The Respondent further contends that the Claimant
improperly relies on Feldman v. Mexico, which is inapposite to the present dispute as its holding
relates to requirements for submitting claims, not to requirements for submitting objections
pursuant to an expedited procedure.” In this connection, the Respondent considers it noteworthy
that the US maintained its silence in its NDP Submission on the question of the sufficiency of the
Respondent’s submission to trigger the Article 10.20.5 expedited review mechanism, including
with respect to the relevance of the Feldman v. Mexico tribunal under the North American Free

Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”).°>

Finally, the Respondent submits that it is irrelevant that Peru has had “more than a year” to prepare
a submission on its preliminary objections, as the Treaty sets the relevant timeframe based on the
date of the Tribunal’s constitution and not on the date on which the Claimant issued its Notice of
Arbitration and Statement of Claim.*° The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s objections are
not aimed at efficiency or cost-effectiveness but rather represent an attempt to “prolong the pacing
of objections for its own tactical purposes”.*”

Consequently, the Respondent argues that it properly raised its Article 10.20.5 objections, and the

Tribunal has the authority to decide on these objections.**

The Tribunal’s analysis

The Tribunal has taken note of the Parties’ contentions regarding the admissibility of the
Respondent’s objections under Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty. The Treaty’s terms require a
“request [that] the tribunal [...] decide on an expedited basis [...] any objection that the dispute
is not within the tribunal’s competence.” The Treaty also imposes a deadline for the Tribunal to

“issue a decision or award on the objection(s)” counted in “days after the date of the request.”

In the view of the Tribunal, and as accepted by the Claimant, a “request” under this provision

need not be equated to a full “memorial” on the objections to be decided. However, the Claimant

also argues—and the Tribunal concurs—that mere “notice” does not constitute a “request” under
this article, either. Naturally, a request to decide an objection must state the objection to be

decided.

The question is nevertheless where in this spectrum the Respondent’s 3 December 2019 letter
falls. Beyond excerpting Articles 10.20.5, 10.1.3, and 10.1.8 of the Treaty and noting the 1
February 2009 date of the Treaty’s entry into force, the elaboration of the Respondent’s objections

is limited to the following five sentences:

Here, Claimant filed its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim in the Treaty Case (the
“Treaty Statement of Claim’) on October 23, 2018. The Parties also have entered into certain
relevant agreeme! [FN1: See, e.g., Framework Agreement (as Amended), March 14,
2017 (Doc. R-10).] [...] Claimant’s claims do not meet the Treaty’s temporal requirements.
As set forth in the Treaty Statement of Claim, the measures that Claimant alleges to have
breached the Treaty occurred either before the Treaty’s entry into force and Claimant first
acquired or should have first acquired, knowledge concerning a breach and loss or damage
arising therefrom before the relevant prescription period. To the extent that the Treaty
Statement of Claim references allegations that arose after the relevant time period, claims
based thereon appear to be impermissible as well for related reasons.

 

    

In the Tribunal’s view, it is clear that the Respondent’s letter did not comport with existing
practice under this type of provision in other treaties based on the same model. Nor does it fit well

with the expedited nature of the process which follows.

The Tribunal need not decide, however, whether prior practice under this provision accurately
reflects the required content for a “request” to be admissible. Given the context surrounding the
Respondent’s letter, and in particular the prior proceedings in Renco J, the Claimant cannot
reasonably plead ignorance of the nature and content of the objections that were being submitted
for expedited determination under Article 10.20.5. In any event, the Tribunal has decided to
dismiss the Respondent’s objections on their substance, such that no ruling on the admissibility

of the objections is ultimately required.

The Respondent’s Preliminary Objections to the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction Pursuant to the
Treaty’s Temporal Requirements

According to Article 10.1.3 of the Treaty, it “does not bind any Party in relation to any act or fact
that took place before the date of entry into force” and therefore, the Treaty may not be applied

retroactively.”?

Article 10.18.1 of the Treaty additionally proscribes the submission of claims to arbitration
following three years after a claimant acquired, or ought to have acquired knowledge, of the

respondent’s alleged breach and the existence of loss or damage resulting from such breach.'”

The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) and indirect
expropriation claims arise out of alleged facts and events that predate the Treaty’s entry into
force.'*' In addition, the Respondent submits that, in initiating the present arbitration on 23
October 2018, the Claimant has failed to abide by the Treaty’s three-year prescription period,
which began either on 23 October 2015 or, if “adjusted in the manner most favourable to the
Claimant”, on 13 November 2013.'°? Consequently, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s
claims are time-barred under both Articles 10.1.3 and 10.18.1 of the Treaty, resulting in “the
concomitant lack of jurisdiction of the tribunal”.'°? The Respondent contends that it is incumbent
upon the Claimant to prove “that it has complied with all requirements for submitting a claim
under the Treaty” and that the Claimant has failed to meet this burden as to the Treaty’s temporal

requirements. '\*

For its part, the Claimant first submits that all of its claims arise out of facts or events that arose
after the Treaty entered into force.'°> The Claimant also notes that it submitted its FET and
indirect expropriation claims in Renco I within three years of first becoming aware of the
Respondent’s breaches of the Treaty and argues that, upon initiating the first arbitration
proceedings, the limitation period was suspended, “such that Claimant’s resubmission of its FET

and indirect expropriation claims in this arbitration also is timely”.'°° The Claimant contends that

comprehensive factual account of its case in order to cure these defects. The Respondent points out that the
Claimant was not required but chose to designate its original subn ion as a “Notice of Arbitration and
Statement of Claim” which under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Article 20(2), “shall include” a
statement of facts in support of a claimant’s claim, and “should, as far as possible, be accompanied by all
documents and other evidence relied upon by the claimant, or contain references to them. Memorial on

its denial of justice claim is also timely because the Supreme Court of Peru rendered its decision
on DRP’s appeal on 3 November 2015, within three years of the Claimant’s initiation of the
present arbitration on 23 October 2018.'°’ Thus, the Claimant argues that all of its claims satisfy
the temporal requirements prescribed by the Treaty and are therefore within the jurisdiction of the

Tribunal.'°*

The Respondent’s objections arising under Article 10.1.3 of the Treaty
a) — Respondent’s position

The Respondent ’s first objection to the Claimant’ s claims arises under Article 10.1.3, about which
the Respondent argues that “[u]nder the plain meaning of Article 10.1.3, the Treaty does not cover
—and, thus, the Contracting Parties have not consented to arbitrate — any claim that is predicated
on alleged acts or facts that took place before the Treaty entered into force”.!

The Respondent contends that tribunals have repeatedly held that their jurisdiction cannot be
retroactively extended over facts or events occurring before an investment treaty’s entry into
force.'!°

The Respondent submits that the tribunal in Berkowitz v. Costa Rica,''' applying an identical
provision under the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement
(“DR-CAFTA”), held that the non-retroactivity rule enshrined in Article 10.1.3 equally applies
to “later measures that are so intertwined with pre-Treaty acts and facts that they cannot be
detached and adjudicated independently”. ''? The Respondent notes that, similar to the
circumstances from which the present dispute arises, the tribunal in Berkowitz v. Costa Rica
declined to extend its jurisdiction to breaches occurring after the DR-CAFTA’s entry into force

because it found that these breaches were enacted in accordance with a regulatory regime

implemented by Costa Rica prior to the treaty’s adoption. ''? The Respondent notes that, although
the US kept its silence on whether the Claimant’s claims violated the non-retroactivity
requirement found in the Treaty, the US approvingly cited Berkowitz v. Costa Rica for the same

standard which underpins its own arguments on the issue.'!

The Respondent notes that the Treaty entered into force on 1 February 2009. In light of the
foregoing considerations, the Respondent submits that this Tribunal’s jurisdiction does not extend
over alleged breaches occurring prior to this date or such breaches occurring thereafter that are
“rooted in, and not independently actionable from the earlier alleged acts or facts”.!!>

To this end, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s FET claim!’ and indirect expropriation
claim are time-barred as they are “predicated on a dispute on DRP’s compliance with its
environmental obligations that predates the entry into force of the Treaty, and Renco has not
alleged any measures in this regard later than 2009”.''’ The Respondent contends that these

claims were time-barred during the Renco / arbitration as well as in the present proceedings.''*

The Claimant’s FET claim

First, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s FET claims that are predicated on facts or events

which occurred prior to the Treaty’s entry into force are automatically time-barred.

The Respondent submits that the majority of the Claimant’s Statement of Facts section of its
Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim presents facts and events which occurred prior to 1

February 2009.'' The Respondent highlights the following relevant facts as presented in the

Secondly, the Respondent contends that the Claimant’s FET claims based on allegations of fact

predates the adoption of the Treaty and are “rooted in, and not independently actionable from the
earlier alleged acts or facts”.!”

The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s remaining FET claims are based on (i) allegations
regarding MEM’s denial of an additional extension and (ii) allegations regarding the public

comments of Peruvian government officials disparaging DRP.'*°

In respect of the first set of allegations, the Respondent notes that, upon failing to complete the
final PAMA project, DRP requested a second extension on 5 March 2009, which the Claimant
claims was unreasonably rejected by MEM in May 2009.'*! The Respondent additionally notes
that the Claimant argues that, despite that in September 2009 the Congress of Peru passed
legislation permitting such an extension, the Government of Peru undermined the benefits of this

law by passing additional onerous regulations.'**

With respect to the second set of allegations, the Respondent notes that the Claimant claims that
Peruvian government officials breached the Treaty FET standard by issuing disparaging public
statements in May 2009, July 2010, and August 2010, allegedly made to discredit DRP vis-a-vis

its creditors. '*°

The Respondent submits that “[t]he denial of the 2009 PAMA extension and public statements
by officials are intrinsically linked to Peru’s efforts of more than a decade to enforce DRP’s

compliance with the obligations it acquired in 1997”. '** Consequently, according to the

Respondent, while the above set of facts occurred after the entry into force of the Treaty, they

each “have deep roots in the pre-entry conduct” and are time-barred. '*>

Claimant’s claims of indirect expropriation

The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s claim of indirect expropriation is also time-barred
by Article 10.1.3 as “[t]he facts alleged by Renco relevant to this claim predate or are deeply

rooted in facts that predate the Treaty’s entry into force”.'°°

First, according to the Respondent, the Claimant contends that the Government of Peru breached

 

the Treaty’s p i by imp ly onerous envi 1 obligations on DRP,
while concurrently failing to provide DRP with reasonable extensions to fulfil these obligations
or otherwise impeded the completion of these tasks when extensions were granted, by disparaging
DRP’s reputation and frustrating its efforts to obtain financing.'” The Respondent submits that
the Claimant applies the same factual support for these claims as it employed with respect to its
FET claim.'** Consequently, the Respondent argues that this claim of breach is time-barred for

the same reasons articulated above.

Secondly, the Respondent notes that the Claimant asserts that Peru violated the Treaty’s
protections against indirect expropriation by “assert[ing] large and baseless credits that gave it
unjustified, creditor voting rights in DRP’s bankruptcy proceeding” so that it might impede DRP’s
reasonable restructuring efforts, force the company to liquidate, and divest Renco of “control of
its investment, indirect ownership of its investment’s assets, and the entire economic value of its
investment in Peru”.'*? The Respondent argues that, because the Claimant alleges that DRP filed
for bankruptcy due to the alleged unfair treatment it suffered from Peru, the basis for its indirect
expropriation claims in respect of DRP’s bankruptcy are “deeply rooted in pre-entry into force

conduct” and are thus time-barred for the same reasons articulated above.”

b) ~— Claimant’s position

The Claimant argues that its claims in the present arbitration arise out of breaches by the

Respondent that occurred after the Treaty entered into force.

First, the Claimant contends that its FET claim that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the
Treaty “is based on Respondent's refusals, starting on March 10, 2009 (after the Treaty came into
effect), to grant contractually required PAMA extensions to DRP, and Peru’s actions thereafter;

as well as Peru’s ensuing disparaging public campaign against Claimant and DRP”."“!

Secondly, the Claimant advances that its indirect expropriation claims that the Respondent
breached Article 10.7 of the Treaty are based on the Respondent’s actions with respect to DRP’s

bankruptcy proceedings, all of which took place in 2012, after the entry into force of the Treaty.'“”

Thirdly, the Claimant challenges the Respondent’s argument that the facts underpinning the
Claimant’s claims that arose after the entry into force of the Treaty are “deeply rooted” in Peru’s
conduct and policies that predate the Treaty and that, for this reason, Claimant’s claims are time-
barred pursuant to Article 10.1.3.'*? The Claimant notes that the US NDP Submission supports
the Claimant's position that the Tribunal may consider facts prior to the Treaty’s entry into force
to determine whether the Respondent committed a breach at a point after the Treaty entered into

force.'“*

The Claimant points out that it bases its claims solely on Peru’s conduct occurring on or after 10
March 2009, a full month after the Treaty’s entry into force. The Claimant emphasizes that while
DRP agreed to assume additional PAMA-imposed obligations and while MEM only partially
granted DRP’s extension request in May 2006, the Claimant does not consider these facts to
constitute wrongful conduct by Peru.'*> According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s violations

of the Treaty began on 10 March 2009, when Peru rejected DRP’s request for an extension to

complete the final PAMA project and began a campaign to disparage and inequitably treat DRP
146

and the Claimant.
The Claimant submits that the Interim Award in Berkowitz v. Costa Rica, upon which the
Respondent exclusively relies, is inapposite, as in that case the claimant sought to apply processes
mandated by DR-CAFTA for providing compensation to the claimant for expropriations which
had taken place before the treaty entered into force.’ The Claimant submits that, in Berkowitz v.
Costa Rica, the tribunal distinguished between completed acts with lingering effects (not
protected by the treaty) and continuing wrongful acts (which do receive protection), when it found
that the compensation question was not “separable from the measures of direct expropriation”
that had taken place prior to the treaty’s entry into force and therefore constituted the lingering
effects of a completed act.'“*

In contrast, the Claimant contends that “all of the facts that form the basis of Renco’s FET and
indirect expropriation claims occurred after the Treaty entered into effect on February 1, 2009”.'°
The Claimant also notes that Article 28 of the VCLT provides that the non-retroactivity principle
relates to “any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date
of the entry into force of the treaty” and does not preclude application of the Treaty to such acts
or facts that continue beyond its entry into force.'*° Consequently, the Claimant advances that,
even were Renco to argue — which it does not — that Peru’s conduct prior to 10 March 2009
constituted part of the basis of its claims, such conduct would be part of a continuing breach over

which the Tribunal has jurisdiction.'*!

c) The Tribunal’s analysis

Article 10.1.3 of the Treaty reads as follows;

For greater certainty, this Chapter does not bind any Party in relation to any act or fact that

took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this

Agreement.
The provision establishes an explicit rule of non-retroactivity. However, as pointed out by the US
in its NDP Submission, the opening phrase “[f]or greater certainty” serves to clarify that the
provision does not purport to be a lex specialis: it stipulates a rule that the contracting parties to
the Treaty already understood to be applicable. That general rule of non-retroactivity of treaties
is found in Article 28 of the VCLT, which provides in almost identical fashion:

Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions

do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which
ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.

 

Article 28 of the VCLT must also be read in conjunction with Articles 13 and 14(1) of the ILC

Articles on State Responsibility, which read as follows:

An act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State
is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs.

[el

The breach of an international obligation by an act of a State not having a continuing
character occurs at the moment when the act is performed, even if its effects continue.
The foregoing provisions reflect the general principle that the lawfulness of State conduct must
be assessed contemporaneously with that conduct. Since a State is not bound by a conventional
obligation it has assumed under a treaty until such treaty enters into force, that treaty obligation

cannot be breached until the treaty giving rise to that obligation has come into force.

In this case, the Treaty entered into force on | February 2009. Therefore, the Treaty cannot be

applied to acts or facts that took place before | February 2009.

This much is uncontroversial between the Parties. However, the Respondent, referring to the
application of non-retroactivity to dismiss the claim in Berkowitz, appears to extrapolate a further
subsidiary rule that, in order not to run afoul of the rule on non-retroactivity, acts or facts which

are relied upon by the Claimant to establish a breach of the Treaty arising after the entry into force

145.

152

155

PCA Case No. 2019-46
Decision on Expedited Preliminary Objections
Page 41 of 75

of the Treaty also must not be “so deeply rooted in pre-entry into force conduct as not to be

meaningfully separable from that conduct.” !

The Tribunal does not understand the tribunal in Berkowitz to purport to modify or supplement
the applicable test for non-retroactivity of treaties, notwithstanding its frequent use of the apposite
but imprecise phrase “deeply rooted”.'*? Rather, the Berkowitz tribunal '*‘—just as almost every
other pertinent decision cited by the Parties and the US'*°—affirms and relies on the authoritative
restatement of the law made by the Mondev tribunal, which this Tribunal equally endorses and

adopts:

The basic principle is that a State can only be internationally responsible for breach of a treaty
obligation if the obligation is in force for that State at the time of the alleged breach. The
principle is stated both in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and in the ILC’s
Articles on State Responsibility, and has been repeatedly affirmed by international tribunals.
There is nothing in NAFTA to the contrary. Indeed Note 39 to NAFTA confirms the position
in providing that “this Chapter covers investments existing on the date of entry into force of
this Agreement as well as investments made or acquired thereafter”. Thus, as the Feldman
Tribunal held, conduct committed before 1 January 1994 cannot itself constitute a breach of
NAFTA.

 

 

On the other hand, it does not follow that events prior to the entry into force of NAFTA may
not be relevant to the question whether a NAFTA Party is in breach of its Chapter 11
obligations by conduct of that Party after NAFTA’s entry into force. To the extent that the
last sentence of the passage from the Feldman decision, quoted in para. 67 above, appears to
say the contrary, it seems to the present Tribunal to be too categorical, as indeed the United
States conceded in argument.

 

Thus events or conduct prior to the entry into force of an obligation for the respondent State
may be relevant in determining whether the State has subsequently committed a breach of
the obligation. But it must still be possible to point to conduct of the State after that date

which is itself a breach. In the present case the only conduct which could possibly constitute
a breach of any provision of Chapter 1 1 is that comprised by the decisions of the SJC and the
Supreme Court of the United States, which between them put an end to LPA’s claims under
Massachusetts law. Unless those decisions were themselves inconsistent with applicable
provisions of Chapter 11, the fact that they related to pre-1994 conduct which might arguably
have violated obligations under NAFTA (had NAFTA been in force at the time) cannot t
Mondev. The mere fact that earlier conduct has gone unremedied or unredressed when a
treaty enters into force does not justify a tribunal applying the treaty retrospectively to that
conduct. Any other approach would subvert both the intertemporal principle in the law of
treaties and the basic distinction between breach and reparation which underlies the law of
State responsibility. °°

 

 

 

Expressed in simpler terms, the principle is that, in order not to pass judgment on the lawfulness
of conduct predating the entry into force of the Treaty, the allegedly wrongful conduct postdating
the entry into force of the Treaty must “constitute an actionable breach in its own right” when
evaluated in the light of all of the circumstances, including acts or facts that predate the entry into
force of the Treaty.'°’ On this essential reading of both Mondev and Berkowitz, the Parties and

the US would seem to agree. !*

The key question is thus whether the Claimant’s FET and indirect expropriation claims
necessarily depend on the alleged wrongfulness of Peru’s conduct prior to 1 February 2009 or

whether they are based on independently actionable breaches that arose after | February 2009.

The Tribunal notes, however, that it is not invited to decide at this juncture whether a treaty breach
has in fact occurred, but merely to determine prima facie whether a treaty breach could have
occurred if the Claimant is able to substantiate its claim on the merits in further proceedings.”
The Tribunal must therefore defer to the factual characterizations put forward by the Claimant

unless the Respondent is able already, at this stage, to conclusively disprove them.

In respect of the Claimant’s FET claim, the Claimant contends that the Respondent breached the
Treaty through MEM’s illegal and unfair refusal on 10 March 2009 to grant an extension to DRP
to complete the 16" and final PAMA project.'® The Respondent answers that the denial of an
extension was justified by and is inseparable from the Claimant’s (non-)performance of its
contractual obligations prior to the entry into force of the Treaty.'°' The Claimant’s request was
but a reiteration of prior requests in the same manner as rejected in the Corona Materials case.'
The Claimant retorts that DRP’s 5 March 2019 extension request was made on a fundamentally
different basis as compared to prior requests and that MEM’s subsequent formal and constructive

denials were made in defiance of specific legislation enacted in September 2009 authorizing such

lick +9 163

an ion and were panied by a “smear

Similarly, the Claimant’s indirect expropriation claim is based on MEM’s assertion on 14
September 2010 of an allegedly improper credit of USD 163 million against DRP in the latter’s
bankruptcy proceedings and MEM’ allegedly improper use of the creditor voting rights it thereby
acquired to oppose to DRP’s restructuring plans in 2012 and force it into liquidation.'®! The
Respondent answers again that DRP’s debt to MEM arises and is inseparable from the Claimant’s
(non-)performance of its contractual obligations prior to the entry into force of the Treaty.'®* The
Claimant retorts that it was an “an absurd self-dealing credit” that was used to “freeze out the
legitimate creditors, and make reorganization impossible.”'®

The Tribunal will need to scrutinize closely which of the foregoing accounts is correct when it
turns to the merits of the Claimant’s FET claims. In particular, the Tribunal will need to establish
with precision the legal situation as it stood on 1 February 2009 and how it evolved thereafter.

The Respondent may yet convince the Tribunal that MEM did nothing but uphold its prior

decisions and hold DRP to its existing contractual and environmental obligations. However, its
assertions are insufficient at this stage to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction to examine these

claims altogether.

The Respondent’s objections arising under Article 10.18.1 of the Treaty
a) — Respondent’s position

The Respondent’s second objection to the Claimant’s claims arises under Article 10.18.1, which
precludes the Claimant from raising claims with respect to breaches which occurred or about
which the Claimant acquired knowledge more than three years prior to submitting the claim to

arbitration.'°7

First, the Respondent submits that the limitation period begins to run upon the “first appreciation
that loss or damage will be (or has been) incurred”! and does not require high particularity or
specificity as to the loss or damage.’ The Respondent agrees with the US that the acquisition of

knowledge starts the prescription period “even if the amount or extent of that loss or damage

cannot be precisely quantified until some future date”.'”°

171

Relying on Grand River v. United States," the Respondent submits that the prescription period

applies not only on the basis of “[a]ctual knowledge”, but also “[c]onstructive knowledge” that a

claimant should or would have acquired had it exercised “reasonable care or diligence”.!””

The Respondent additionally advances that “a continuing course of alleged measures does not

renew the prescription period”.!” Relying on Berkowitz v. Costa Rica,'™

the Respondent submits
that the Claimant cannot overcome the time limitation by claiming that the breach is a continuing
course of conduct beyond the expiry of the prescription period, as that would deprive the

limitation provision of meaning.'’°

Secondly, according to the Respondent, the relevant cut-off date for the purposes of Article
10.18.1, ie. the date prior to which any alleged breaches of the Treaty are time-barred in this case,
is 13 November 2013. The Respondent notes that while the Notice of Arbitration was filed on 23
October 2018 and the three-year prescription period would, therefore, normally lead to 23 October
2015 being the cut-off date, the Parties agreed to suspend the prescription period during their
consultations in 2016-2018, which lasted for 709 days. Therefore, the Respondent asserts that the
cut-off date is 13 November 2013, being 709 days prior to 23 October 2015.!7°

Thirdly, the Respondent submits that the prescription period was not (further) suspended because
yin

of the Claimant’s mere initiation of arbitral proceedings in Renco
The Respondent claims that the US’s interpretation of Article 10.18.1 aligns with the
Respondent’s proffered interpretation of the three-year limitation period as a “clear and rigid”
requirement that is not subject to any “suspension”, “prolongation” or “other qualification”.!7*

Moreover, according to the Respondent, the express text of Articles 10.16.2, 10.16.3, 10.16.4,
10.18.1 and 10.18.2 makes clear that a mere notice of arbitration, without more, does not suspend
the running of the prescription period; instead, unless the notice of arbitration meets all of the

requirements stipulated in the foregoing provisions of the Treaty, including a valid waiver, the

In addition, the Respondent submits that its position is supported by the object and purpose of the
Treaty (in particular that of “ensur[ing] a predictable legal [...] framework”) and of Article

10.18.1 (protecting respondent States from late or recurring claims).'*?

Also, the Respondent argues, relying in particular on Feldman v. Mexico, that the general
principles of international or domestic law invoked by the Claimant cannot supersede the lex
specialis terms of the Treaty.'*? The Respondent adds that the Claimant mischaracterizes
Feldman v. Mexico by pulling an isolated quote out of context to suggest that acknowledgement
of an arbitration claim could interrupt the limitation period, while the “acknowledgement”

referred to in that case had nothing to do with the arbitration and the tribunal anyway rejected the

claimant’s argument. '** Moreover, the Respondent notes that the Parties having agreed to a
suspension of the prescription period during their consultations after the conclusion of Renco I
does not support the Claimant’s position because a respondent State is always free to waive its

jurisdictional objections.'*

Furthermore, the Respondent contends that the factual differences invoked by the Claimant
between the present case and the cases cited in the US Submission do not overcome or alter the

clear legal standard set forth in the Treaty.'*°

Fourthly, the Respondent contends that the Claimant first actually or constructively acquired

must dismiss the claims for lack of competence”.'*”

In this regard, the Respondent highlights the following relevant facts as presented in the
Claimant’s Statement of Claim, which arose between the Treaty’s entry into force on | February

2009 and 13 November 2013:'**
- February 2009: DRP’s loss of its US$ 75 million revolving line of credit.'*

- March, May, and June 2009: DRP’s request for an extension in March; MEM’s
rejection of the request in May; and DRP’s resulting suspension of operations at the
facility in June.'”

- September 2009: the promulgation of a law by the Congress of Peru permitting an
extension for DRP, but subsequent imposition of additional regulations undermining

the benefits of the new law."”!

- February 2010: the decision of MEM to reject restructuring and to involuntarily place
DRP into bankruptcy and Peru’s alleged “patently improper claim for US$ 163
million.”'

- November 2011: efforts by Peru to prevent DRP’s restructuring and to force its
liquidation, specifically, the INDECOPI Tribunal’s resolution reversing INDECOPI

Bankruptcy Commission’s allegedly proper rejection of MEM’s credit offering.'°*

The Respondent contends that each of these events occurred earlier than the cut-off date of 13
November 2013, and as such they are time-barred from arbitration in the present proceedings. '**
The Respondent posits that the fact that the Claimant’s submissions in the present arbitration are
substantially identical to those which were alleged in Renco J, with only minimal edits and
deletions, provides further support to the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant’s claims are

now time-barred, years following the initiation of the Renco I proceedings. '°*

Specifically, with respect to the Claimant’s FET claim, the Respondent notes that the most recent
conduct of the Respondent on which the Claimant relies took place in 2009, i.e. years before the

cut-off date.'°°

As regards the Claimant’s indirect expropriation claim, the Respondent submits that all relevant
events likewise occurred far in advance of the cut-off date and the Claimant had or should have
had knowledge of any alleged breach of the Treaty.'°’ The Respondent emphasizes that the
Claimant’s indirect expropriation claim rests on (1) MEM’s refusal to reasonably provide DRP
with extensions necessary to prevent the termination of operations of the facility; (2) the alleged

disparaging comments by Peruvian government officials aimed at undermining DRP;'°* and (3)

“DRP[’s] bankruptcy in 2009, the recognition of a MEM credit, and the decision by a committee

of creditors to reject restructuring and place DRP in liquidation” in 2012.'”

Also, the Respondent highlights that in Renco J the Claimant’s notice of arbitration and statement
of claim dated 9 August 2011 already stated that the Respondent’s treatment of DRP “has the
potential to culminate in an expropriation”, describing the Respondent’s assertion of a credit in
the DRP bankruptcy as “patently bogus”. According to the Respondent, this shows that the
Claimant had knowledge of the alleged breach in August 2011, since only a first appreciation that
loss or damage will be incurred is needed to trigger the limitation period.2”

Regarding the Claimant’s denial of justice claim, which relates to local proceedings initiated by
the Claimant in an attempt to challenge the MEM credit, the Respondent asserts that the only
alleged fact that post-dates the cut-off date is the Peruvian Supreme Court’s rejection of DRP’s
appeal on 3 November 2015.7"! However, the Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot rely
on this decision to circumvent the limitation periods” because of prior rulings in these local
proceedings (culminating in the Supreme Court ruling) whose dates show that the claim
materialized prior to the cut-off date.””

According to the Respondent, if recognition of the MEM credit was patently absurd, as contended
by the Claimant, a respective breach would have materialized already on 22 November 2010 when
the Claimant opposed the recognition of this credit before INDECOPI or, at the very latest, when
the first-instance administrative court rendered its decision on the Claimant’s challenge on 18

October 2012.74

The Respondent argues that this position is supported in particular by the rulings in ATA v. Jordan
and Mondev vy. United States, where the tribunals held that the relevant point in time to the

prescription analysis for a denial of justice claim is when the dispute arose, not when remedies

were exhausted.””°

Also, the Respondent argues that following the decision in Corona Materials
v. Dominican Republic, the Tribunal should not accept the Claimant’s treating the alleged denial
of justice as distinct from its claim that the credit should not have been recognized by INDECOPI
in the first place.?°°

The Respondent notes that while the US stated that the limitation does not begin to run until all
domestic remedies have been exhausted, it also stated that “a continuing course of conduct cannot
renew the limitations period under Article 10.18.1” and that “the exhaustion of local remedies
will not give rise to a legally distinct injury, unless the institutions to whom appeal has been made
commit some new breach of the applicable standard.” For this reason, the Respondent submits
that, as the Claimant has not raised any new breach with respect to the decision of the Supreme

Court of Peru, the denial of justice claim is therefore time-barred.?"”

Finally, the Respondent submits that the Claimant’s “abuse of rights” argument is meritless,
208

neither mentioned in the US’s submission, nor anywhere in the Treaty.
The Respondent asserts that the Claimant has failed to establish that its abuse theory has achieved
such widespread recognition and consensus as to constitute a general principle of international
law, and notes that the Claimant failed to identify a single case where such a theory has been used
against a respondent State.” The Respondent adds that even the authorities relied on by the

Claimant caution against a broad application of general abuse principles.”!”

The Respondent further contends that the Renco J Interim Award never ruled that a limitations
defence would be abusive. The Respondent points out that, on the contrary, the tribunal ruled that
Respondent's raising of the waiver defence was not an abuse of rights.’!! The Respondent
acknowledges that dicta in the Renco J Interim Award suggested that justice would be served if
Respondent accepted that prescription was tolled as of 9 August 2011 (the date on which the
Claimant files its amended notice of arbitration in Renco I). However, the Respondent argues that
those were incidental comments on issues that were not arbitrated and have no binding or
preclusive effect in the present proceeding, and notes that the tribunal in Renco J expressly stated
that it “cannot prevent Peru from exercising in the future what it then considers to be its legal
rights”.?!?

Additionally, the Respondent denies the Claimant’s assertion that Respondent “ran the clock” by
delaying the first arbitration, arguing that it exercised its Treaty rights reasonably.”'? According
to the Respondent, it was the Claimant who attempted to protract the Renco I proceedings by
refusing to amend its non-compliant waiver and opposing Peru’s request that the tribunal hear its
preliminary objections on an expedited basis. 7"? The Respondent rejects the Claimant's
insinuation that the Respondent acted abusively in the Renco I proceedings by not raising its
objection to the non-compliant waiver in its Statement of Claim, noting that, pursuant to Article
23(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Peru had no obligation to raise such an objection until

its Counter-Memorial on Liability, and in fact raised its claims much earlier”!

The Respondent argues that the Claimant seeks to rely on its own non-compliance with Treaty
requirements during Renco J to circumvent the Treaty’s temporal requirements barring its claims
in the present proceedings.?'° The Respondent insists that a claimant must meet all of the Treaty’s

preconditions in order to submit a claim to arbitration, meaning that the Claimant cannot comply

partially with the Treaty’s requirements in Renco I, do the same in the present proceeding, and
then somehow argue that the cumulative effect of the two deficient proceedings is that it has

properly submitted claims to arbitration.7!”

For these reasons, the Respondent concludes that the Claimant has failed to submit any claims

complying with Article 10.18.1, and its claims consequently should be dismissed for lack of

jurisdiction because the Respondent has not consented to arbitrate them.?'*

b) ~— Claimant’s position

The Claimant argues that its claims are not time-barred by the prescription period under Article

10.18.1.

First, the Claimant notes that its FET and indirect expropriation claims in the present arbitration

 

arise out of acts and facts occurring within three years of submitting these claims to arbitration in
Renco I. The Claimant claims that, on 10 March 2009, Peru first breached the Treaty’s Article
10.5 FET requirements when MEM denied DRP’s request for an extension to complete the final
(sixteenth) PAMA project on the basis of the economic force majeure provision contained in the
Stock Transfer Agreement, in contravention of legislation passed by the Congress of Peru
permitting a 30-month extension.”!? The Claimant submits that this was the first of a series of
failures to permit an extension and was followed by a “smear campaign” against the Claimant and

DRP.

The Claimant further claims that, on 14 September 2010, the Respondent committed the first act
in contravention of the Treaty’s Article 10.7 protections against indirect expropriation, when
MEM asserted a credit against DRP that endowed Peru with nearly one third of all voting rights
on the creditors’ committee of DRP’s bankruptcy. According to the Claimant, this preceded
further actions by Peru to force DRP’s liquidation in July 2012 and deny the Claimant the control

over and enjoyment of its investment in Peru.?”°

The Claimant notes that Renco initiated the Renco I proceedings on 9 August 2011, within the

three-years of the aforementioned dates of breach, the earliest of which was 10 March 2009.”
Secondly, the Claimant argues that the initiation of the Renco I proceedings suspended the
Treaty’s Article 10.18.1 prescription period with respect to its FET and indirect expropriation

claims.

The Claimant notes that Article 10.18.1 of the Treaty is silent as to whether a timely submission
of claims to arbitration, which must later be resubmitted due to a dismissal on jurisdictional
grounds without prejudice, will suspend the three-year limitation period.”? The Claimant submits
that the Respondent’s argument of the Treaty containing a lex specialis on the issue of a
suspension of the prescription period is meritless and finds no support in the NDP Submission of
the US.? In particular, the Claimant notes that Articles 10.16 and 10.18 relied on by the
Respondent in this regard each deal with different things, the latter pertaining to conditions and

d.?4 Moreover, the

limitations on consent, rather than to the timing of when a claim is submitte
Claimant argues that if the respective Treaty provision were a lex specialis so as to exclude any
suspension, it would not have been possible for the Parties to repeatedly agree to a suspension
after the conclusion of Renco I, as they did.?”°

To fill this lacuna in the Treaty, the Claimant submits that Article 31(1) of the VCLT requires
that the Tribunal examine the “object and purpose” of the Treaty provision and relevant rules of

international law.”

Relying on jurisprudence related to analogous provisions in other US treaties and upon the treatise
of Bin Cheng, the Claimant asserts that a time-bar as introduced by Article 10.18.1 of the Treaty
seeks to prevent claimants from unreasonably delaying the submission of their claims to

arbitration, and to ensure that respondents have access to sufficient and reliable evidence to defend

themselves. According to the Claimant, this object and purpose was satisfied by the Claimant
timely submitting its FET and indirect expropriation claims in Renco J, without any negligent
delay, thus putting the Respondent on notice of the need to secure sufficient and reliable evidence

to defend itself, which it did.”””

Additionally, the Claimant advances that it is “a general principle of law recognized by civilized
nations”, which the Tribunal must take into consideration when interpreting Article 10.18.1
pursuant to the VCLT, that limitation periods are suspended when a claimant puts a government
on notice of a claim.” Thus, the Claimant contends that, in accordance with the “relevant rules
of international law”, when Renco timely submitted its claims in Renco I to the competent

authority and put Peru on notice of the Claimant’s claims, the prescription period was

suspended.”

The Claimant argues that the Respondent’s contention that the three-year limitation period under
Article 10.18.1 is “not subject to any suspension, tolling, prolongation or other qualification” is
incongruous with the object and purpose of the provision and relevant rules of international law,
and relies improperly on the non-disputing party submission filed by the US in Gramercy v. Peru
with respect to the North American Free Trade Agreement.”” The Claimant notes that in the cases

cited by the US’ non-disputing party submission in that case, as well as in the NDP Submission

of the US in the present case, the claimants failed to initiate any arbitration proceedings in the
three-year window, inapposite to the present case.”*! The Claimant emphasizes that in the instant
case, “Peru has been aware of Claimant’s claims since 2011 and is suffering no limitations
prejudice as a result of Claimant’s resubmission of its claims in this arbitration”.?*?

The Claimant further notes that in Feldman v. Mexico, as relied upon by the Respondent, the
tribunal conceded that “an acknowledgment of the claim under dispute by the organ competent to
that effect and in the form prescribed by law would probably interrupt the running of the period
of limitation”. The Claimant argues that the Respondent acknowledged the Claimant’s claims in
Renco I by participating in that arbitration without ever questioning that it was aware of the
dispute and of its obligation to retain documents and defend itself, and by subsequently

negotiating with the Claimant to settle the dispute.?*>

For the above reasons, the Claimant submits that the limitation period was suspended from 9
August 2011 (submission of the amended notice of arbitration in Renco I) to 9 November 2016
(final award in Renco 1).?*

Thirdly, the Claimant notes that as of 10 November 2016, i.e. the day after the final award in
Renco I was issued, the Parties entered into several agreements under which they agreed on
consultations pertaining to the Notice of Intent. These agreements, which were in force until 20
October 2018, provided that the time during which they were in effect would not count towards

the limitation period of Article 10.18.1.7°

The Claimant concludes that the only added time to be counted towards the limitation period after
the Claimant’s submission of its claims in Renco J is three days, from 20 October 2018 until its
submission of the Notice of Arbitration on 23 October 2018. The Claimant contends that, as a

result, its claims were filed in compliance with the three-year limitation period.?*°

Fourthly, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s objections to Claimant’s FET and indirect

expropriation claims on the basis of Article 10.18.1 constitute an abuse of rights.

The Claimant notes that, on 4 April 2011, it submitted a notice of arbitration in Renco I with a
waiver including reservation of rights language. The Claimant further notes that despite
“countless opportunities to raise its objection relating to Claimant’s waiver”, including the
expedited review mechanism under Article 10.20.5, it was not until three and one half years later,
on 3 October 2014, that Peru objected for the first time to the additional reservation of rights
language in the waiver — after having previously made ambiguous statements on its waiver
objection in multiple submissions. The Claimant adds that had the Respondent raised its objection
to the additional reservation of rights language in a timely fashion, the Claimant could have
removed it from its waiver within three years of the breaches alleged as a basis for the FET and
indirect expropriation claims. In fact, the Claimant asserts that it repeatedly offered during
Renco I to strike the contentious reservation of rights language in its waiver, provided that the
Respondent gave assurance that it would not then object to the claims being prescribed, but the
Respondent failed to accept this.?*’ According to the Claimant, one may reasonable conclude that
the Respondent purposefully delayed raising its waiver objection in a bad faith effort to allow the
limitations period to expire, and if it prevailed on its belated waiver objection, to raise a limitations

objection in a refiled arbitration.”

The Claimant submits that, while the Renco / tribunal dismissed the case because of this technical
error with Renco’s written waiver, the tribunal noted and “unanimously condemned” that the
Respondent waited three and a half years to raise its waiver objections.”° The Claimant contends
that the Respondent now seeks to prejudice the Claimant by asserting that the time elapsed during
those arbitration proceedings, due to the Respondent’s own delay tactics, should count against the
prescription period set by Article 10.18.1.7°

The Claimant further notes that the tribunal in Renco J held that “an abuse of rights might be
found to exist if Peru were to argue in any future proceeding that Renco’s claims were now time-

barred until Article 10.18(1)” as the Respondent does now, and unanimously found that “justice

would be served if Peru accepted that time stopped running for the purposes of Article 10.18(1)
when Renco filed its Amended Notice of Arbitration on August 9, 2011”.%"! The Claimant also
points out that the tribunal in Renco J acknowledged that “Renco would suffer material prejudice
if Peru were to claim in any subsequent arbitration that Renco’s claims were now time-barred

under Article 10.18(1)”."

The Claimant proffers that “[i]t is well-settled that a right may be refused recognition on the
ground that it is being abused”, when exercising the right is purposed toward prejudicing the
interests of the other party.”“3 The Claimant notes that it is unnecessary to prove bad faith for a
Tribunal to find abuse of rights and proscribe the Respondent’s exercise of any rights arising
under Article 10.18.1.** The Claimant further notes that the tribunal in the 1903 Stevenson Case
specifically found that a State could not invoke a defence of prescription when it was responsible

for causing the delay.”°

The Claimant notes that the US did not contradict its contention that a party may be prevented

from exercising rights wherein the exercise thereof would constitute an abuse of rights.“

In sum, the Claimant submits that, given the Respondent’s own conduct in Renco I, Respondent’s
objections under Article 10.18.1 constitute an abuse of rights and should therefore be dismissed

by the Tribunal.”

Fifthly, the Claimant claims that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the Treaty when, on 3
November 2015, the Supreme Court of Peru failed to nullify a “patently improper credit by the

Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines” and rejected DRP’s appeal on the issue.”"* The Claimant

argues that, having initiated the present arbitration on 23 October 2018, within three years of the

Supreme Court decision, this claim satisfies the Article 10.18.1 temporal requirement.”

According to the Claimant, the Parties agree as to the facts of DRP’s submission of a claim to
trial and subsequent appeal before the Peruvian judiciary regarding MEM’s improper assertion of
a claim for US$ 163 million against DRP when it entered bankruptcy in February 2010.7
However, the Claimant notes that the Parties differ in that the Respondent argues that the denial
of justice claim is time-barred because it arose out of the 2010 bankruptcy proceedings and, at the
latest, in 2012, when “Renco’s affiliate(s) initiated and pursued the contentious administrative

challenge’

The Claimant submits that “[i]t is axiomatic that when a court decision is not final and binding,
and can be corrected by internal appellate mechanisms, a denial of justice cannot have arisen”.?>?
Relying on Chevron v. Ecuador, the Claimant advances that the “finality” requirement mandates
that all local remedies be exhausted before a denial of justice claim may be asserted.**

The Claimant highlights the NDP Submission, wherein the US states that “non-final judicial acts
have not ripened into the type of final act that is sufficiently definite to implicate state
responsibility, unless further recourse is obviously futile or manifestly ineffective. In the context
of a claim of denial of justice, therefore, the three-year limitations period set out in Article 10.18.1
will not begin to run [...] when all available domestic remedies have been exhausted, unless

obviously futile or manifestly ineffective.”*™*

According to the Claimant, the Respondent misapplies Mondev v. United States? and ATA v.
Jordan when it argues that “the moment in time that is relevant to the prescription analysis for
a denial of justice claim is when the dispute arose, not when remedies were exhausted”.”*’ The
Claimant submits that these holdings do not apply to the issue of prescription, but rather to
instances in which the alleged breach occurred prior to the entry into force of the investment
treaty. ** Thus, the Claimant contends that these holdings do not apply to the present

arbitration.?°°

Furthermore, the Claimant asserts that Article 10.18.1 establishes a time limitation from the point
that a claimant acquires knowledge, or ought to have acquired knowledge that a respondent
breached the treaty, not the moment that the dispute arose.” The Claimant asserts that it was not
until the Supreme Court of Peru rejected DRP’s appeal against the Lima Superior Court’s decision
upholding MEM’s alleged bankruptcy credit that Peru breached Article 10.5 of the Treaty.”°' The
Claimant submits that it necessarily follows that it was only on this date, 3 November 2015, that
the Claimant could have acquired knowledge of Respondent’s breach, and thus, the Claimant’s

denial of justice claim is not time-barred as under Article 10.18.1.2°?

c) The Tribunal’s analysis

The Tribunal notes that the earliest breach asserted by the Claimant in this case is MEM’s refusal
on 10 March 2009 to grant an extension for the completion of the Claimant’s sixteenth (and last)

PAMA obligation. Accordingly, as the Claimant accepts that it acquired knowledge of the breach

on that day,

the three-year prescription period pursuant to Article 10.18.1 began to run on 10
March 2009 insofar as the Claimant’s claim rests on this asserted breach. The Tribunal finds it
useful to focus its analysis of the prescription issue on this portion of the claim because, logically,
if the first breach alleged by the Claimant is not time-barred under Article 10.18.1, the same holds

true for all other breaches asserted in this arbitration.

When the Claimant filed its original and amended notices of arbitration in Renco J on 4 April
2011 and 9 August 2011, respectively, less than three years had elapsed since the alleged breach
on 10 March 2009. Accordingly, and having already determined above that this alleged breach is

264 the Tribunal concludes that

actionable independently from earlier conduct of the Respondent,
the Claimant’s FET and indirect expropriation claims brought in the instant proceeding were not

yet time-barred when the Claimant submitted its notices of arbitration in Renco I.

In addition, it is undisputed between the Parties that between the conclusion of Renco J and the
filing of the Notice of Arbitration in the present case, only three days elapsed in respect of which
the Parties had not agreed on a suspension of the prescription period. These three days do not
make any material difference because the notices of arbitration in Renco I were filed several
months before the three-year period elapsed. Therefore, unless Peru is precluded from invoking
Article 10.18.1 due to an abuse of rights, the decisive question is whether the prescription period
was suspended in relation to the Claimant’s FET and indirect expropriation claims during the
pendency of Renco J. If it was not, the claim resting on MEM’s refusal to grant an extension
would have become prescribed on 11 March 2012. The same holds true for all other claims resting
on breaches alleged to have occurred before 13 November 2013 (i.e. the cut-off date calculated

by the Respondent).

As a matter of course, the arbitral proceedings in Renco I could only have suspended the
prescription period in relation to the Claimant’s FET and indirect expropriation claims if these
same claims were already submitted in Renco J. The Tribunal notes that the Parties agree this is

the case,”®* and does not see any reason to find otherwise. In particular, while certain facts invoked

in relation to the indirect expropriation claim post-date the notices of arbitration in Renco I
(notably MEM’s vote in support of DRP’s liquidation, which occurred in July 2012), the
Respondent accepts, as does this Tribunal, that these developments were already anticipated by
the Claimant in its amended notice of arbitration in Renco 1.” In addition, the Tribunal notes that
the Claimant introduced these additional facts in its Memorial on Liability in Renco J and
expanded the scope of its FET and indirect expropriation claims accordingly.”°” Therefore, the
Tribunal concludes that if Renco J resulted in a suspension of the limitations period for all claims
subject to that arbitration, the Claimant’s FET and indirect expropriation claims would benefit in

their entirety from such suspension.

In view of the Parties’ arguments on the suspension issue, the Tribunal finds it useful to divide its

analysis into two questions as follows:

(a) First, is there a general principle of law recognized under international law pursuant to

which prescription periods are suspended during the pendency of an arbitration?

(b) Secondly, what is the Treaty’s position on the question of whether the prescription

period in Article 10.18.1 is suspended pending arbitral proceedings?
The Tribunal will analyse both questions in turn.

Does arbitration suspend prescription periods under general principles of law recognized under
international law?

In the first prong of its argument that the Renco I proceedings suspended the prescription period,
the Claimant submits that it is a “general principle of law recognized by civilized nations” under
Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute that prescription periods are suspended for the duration of

relevant judicial or arbitral proceedings. The Tribunal concurs.

While international law generally holds individual States’ internal law to be irrelevant to a State’s

obligations under international law, 268

it nevertheless acknowledges that issues may arise in
respect of which there is no clearly applicable treaty or customary international law obligation,
but also no clear inference to be derived from the silence thereof. In this domain, and especially

where the international rule to be applied finds its origin in analogous national law, the “rules

generally accepted by municipal legal systems” may be invoked in order that the ultimate result
not “lose touch with reality”. Accordingly, the “general principles of law recognized by
civilized nations” may be resorted to in a gap-filling capacity as one of the sources of international

law authoritatively enumerated in Article 38(1) of the ICJ Statute.

The existence of such principles is not lightly presumed. In order for a principle to rise to the level
of a “general principle of law” under Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute, it must be “generally
accepted” across national legal systems. The exact degree of acceptance required remains a
subject of debate. However, no such difficulty arises in this case. The Claimant has pointed to the
laws of Peru, Argentina, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United
States. ?”” The Claimant also cites early arbitral decisions from which the rules of prescription in
international law originated as a general principle adopted by analogy from national legal systems
and Roman law, including most notably the Gentini Case, which held that “the presentation of a
claim to competent authority within proper time will interrupt the running of prescription.”?”!

To this list, the Tribunal can add further international and transnational instruments. For instance,
Article 13 of the 1974 United Nations Convention on the Limitation Period in the International

Sale of Goods provides as follows:

The limitation period shall cease to run when the creditor performs any act which, under the
law of the court where the proceedings are instituted, is recognized as commencing judicial
proceedings against the debtor or a ing his claim in such proceedings already instituted
against the debtor, for the purpose of obtaining satisfaction or recognition of his claim.

 

 

This provision was later endorsed and adopted as the basis for Article 10.5 of the UNIDROIT

Principles on International Commercial Contracts, which provides that “(t]he running of the

limitation period is suspended [...] when the obligee performs any act, by commencing judicial
proceedings or in judicial proceedings already instituted, that is recognized by the law of the court
as asserting the obligee’s right against the obligor.”?” The official commentary to this latter

provision reads as follows:

Inall legal systems judicial proceedings affect the running of a limitation period in either of
Judicial proceedings can cause an interruption of the limitation period, so that
a new limitation period begins when the judicial proceedings end. Alternatively, judicial
proceedings can cause only a suspension, so that a period that has already lapsed before the
judicial proceedings began will be deducted from the applicable period, the remaining period
starting at the end of the judicial procedure.2”>

 

The existence of such a general principle is not seriously disputed by the Respondent, who has
not referred the Tribunal to a single jurisdiction in which prescription periods are not suspended
during the pendency of legal proceedings. Instead, the Respondent submits that the Treaty’s three-
year prescription period establishes a lex specialis that wholly excludes the application of general

principles.” It is to this argument that the Tribunal turns next.

What is the Treaty’s position ing a ion of the Article 10.18.1 deadline pending
arbitral proceedings?

While the Parties diverge as to whether the Treaty is silent or conversely contains a lex specialis
on the question of whether the three-year prescription period is suspended during arbitral
proceedings, the Tribunal understands that there is no dispute between the Parties about the fact
that neither Article 10.18.1 nor any other provision of the Treaty expressly addresses this question.
Indeed, the Tribunal has no difficulty in finding that the Treaty does not expressly deal at all with

the issue of a suspension of the prescription period — neither whether such a suspension may occur

at all nor, if so, whether submitting a claim to arbitration is a circumstance that could trigger such

suspension.

Consequently, it is for the Tribunal to interpret the Treaty so as to ascertain whether one can infer
from it an implicit position on the possibility of suspending the prescription period provided for
in Article 10.18.1 for the pendency of arbitral proceedings, in particular in the presence of a

defective waiver.

The articles of the Treaty invoked by the Respondent in support of its position that the Treaty
contains a /ex specialis regarding a suspension of the prescription period read, in relevant part, as

follows:

10.16.2 At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under this Section, a
claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its intention to submit the claim

a]

 

10.16.3 Provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim, a
claimant may submit a claim [to arbitration].

10.16.4 A claim shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section when the
claimant's notice of or request for arbitration [...] referred to in Article 3 of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules, together with the statement of claim referred to in [then] Article 18 [now
Article 20] of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, are received by the respondent.

 

 

10.18.1 No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three years
have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired,
knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant [...]
has incurred loss or damage.

   

10.18.2 No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless [...] (b) the notice
of arbitration is accompanied by the claimant’s written waiver of any right to initiate or
continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other
dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to
constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.

 

The Respondent submits that a combined reading of the above Articles makes clear that a notice
of arbitration accompanied by a defective waiver as to local proceedings does not suspend the
running of the prescription period. Rather, the Respondent argues that the relevant event
suspending the Treaty’s prescription period is the “submission of a claim to arbitration”, which
in the Respondent’s view requires, amongst other things, a waiver conforming with

Article 10.18.2. Therefore, according to the Respondent, the prescription period continues

222.

223.

224.

216

PCA Case No. 2019-46
Decision on Expedited Preliminary Objections
Page 65 of 75

running if a notice of arbitration is filed with an invalid waiver because, in such case, the claim

was “never submitted to arbitration”.””*

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the prescription period is suspended once the claim
is “submitted to arbitration”. The Tribunal further agrees with the Respondent that the term
“submitted to arbitration” should be taken to have the same meaning in Article 10.18.1 as it has
in the other provisions quoted in paragraph 220 above. Indeed, these provisions provide context

to Article 10.18.1 within the meaning of Article 31(1) and (2) of the VCLT.

However, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Respondent’s contention that the text of the Articles
invoked indicate that no claim was ever “submitted to arbitration” if the notice of arbitration did
not include a waiver conforming with Article 10.18.2 (as was found to have been the case in
Renco 1). In fact, the plain language of Article 10.16.4, referred to by the Respondent itself,
suggests the opposite: If a notice of arbitration and statement of claim is filed in accordance with
Articles 3 and 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules, this is the point in time at which the claim “shall be
deemed to be submitted to arbitration”. In other words, once a notice of arbitration and statement
of claim conforming with the formal filing requirements of the UNCITRAL Rules is submitted,
Article 10.16.4 requires the Tribunal to treat the claim as having been “submitted to arbitration”,
with the necessary consequence that the prescription period under Article 10.18.1 ceases to run
as of this point in time (this consequence being acknowledged by the Respondent itself in the
event that a claim is “submitted to arbitration”?”).

The texts of the other Articles of the Treaty invoked by the Respondent either do not add anything
to this textual analysis (Article 10.16.2) or merely stipulate, just like Article 10.18.1 itself, under
which circumstances a claim “may” be submitted to arbitration (Articles 10.16.3 and 10.18.2).
However, the fact that a notice and statement of claim filed in accordance with the UNCITRAL
Rules “may [not] be submitted to arbitration” in a given case (and therefore stands to be dismissed,
at least if corresponding objections are raised) because the requirements of Articles 10.16 or 10.18
are not met, does not call into question that such a claim is in fact (deemed to be) “submitted to
arbitration” based on Article 10.16.4 and, therefore, stops the prescription period from running.

This is further confirmed by the final paragraph of Article 10.16.4, which again refers to the date

of receipt under the applicable arbitration rules for the determination of the effective date on

which a claim asserted subsequently to the notice of arbitration has been submitted.?””

Nor does any other context (none is invoked by the Parties) or the object and purpose of the
Treaty, give the terms “shall be deemed”, “may”, and “submitted to arbitration” an ordinary
meaning to the effect that the prescription period continues running if a notice of arbitration is

filed in accordance with Article 10.16.4 but fails to include a valid waiver.

The Parties seem to agree, as does this Tribunal, that one of the objectives of the Treaty is to
provide a predictable legal framework, and that Article 10.18.1 in particular aims at providing

278

legal predictability by protecting State respondents against late*’* claims, not least to ensure that

claims will be resolved when evidence is reasonably available and fresh.?”?

The Tribunal finds that this object and purpose does not support reading into the term “submitted
to arbitration”, as used in Article 10.18.1, a requirement of a valid waiver so as to avoid the
otherwise applicable suspension of the prescription period. Contrary to the Respondent’s
argument, the object and purpose of both the Treaty and the prescription period in its Article
10.18.1 are not inconsistent at all with the prescription period being suspended during arbitral
proceedings, irrespective of whether there is a defective waiver. The existence and length of such
suspension can be easily and clearly established by reference to the dates of the notice of
arbitration and the final award (or termination order), thus not calling into question legal
predictability. Furthermore, if an arbitration is filed within the prescription period, this will

prompt a diligent respondent State to find and secure evidence, such that sufficient evidence will

Treaty, Art. 10.16.4 (“A claim asserted by the claimant for the first time after such notice of arbitration is
submitted shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section on the date of its receipt under the
applicable arbitral rules.”).

While the Respondent suggests that the objective of prescription periods is also to protect respondent States
from “recurring” claims (Respondent’s Comments on NDP Submission, {[ 65), the Respondent has not
offered any support for this suggestion and the Tribunal does not agree with it. By their very nature,
prescription periods are only concerned with claims that are made after a certain point in time. They do not
protect a respondent against recurrent claims for as long as they are filed within the prescription period.

be available to it even if a second arbitration is filed after the conclusion of the first one. This
applies with special force if, as in the present case, the respondent State must reasonably expect,
upon or shortly after the conclusion of the first arbitration, that the same claim will be re-filed.?*°
In such a case, the respondent State is aware of the need to preserve its evidence beyond the
duration of the first arbitration. In addition, the Tribunal notes that in most, if not all, legal
systems, prescription periods pursue the same objectives as Article 10.18.1, but are nonetheless

281

subject to possible suspensions,~"’ thus confirming that suspensions are generally compatible with

the objectives underlying prescription periods.

Moreover, despite the US and, subsequently, Peru submitting that the limitation period is “clear
and rigid”, not to be modified by any “suspension, prolongation or other qualification”, the
Tribunal considers that this does not give the terms of the Treaty an ordinary meaning to the effect
that a suspension of the prescription period of Article 10.18.1 requires, in addition to a claim
being “submitted to arbitration” pursuant to Article 10.16.4, the presence of a waiver complying

with Article 10.18.2(b).7*

As “clear and rigid” as this general statement of the Contracting Parties purports to be, the
Tribunal notes that both Contracting Parties do qualify it in their submissions in the instant

proceedings.

The US, for its part, refers in its NDP Submission to Feldman v. Mexico® as the source for its

provided for in Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) of NAFTA (which is analogous to Article 10.18.1)
is “interrupted”, ie. suspended, under certain circumstances.”* In addition, the Tribunal notes
that in its non-disputing party submissions in Gramercy and Corona Materials, the US
specifically stated that a claim was not “submitted to arbitration” within the meaning of Article
10.18.1 (or the analogous provision in Article 10.18.1 of DR-CAFTA) unless it was accompanied
by a valid waiver of local proceedings.**° Such statement is notably absent from the NDP

Submission in the present case.

The Respondent, in turn, expressly confirmed in its pleadings that a notice of arbitration that
conforms with all requirements of the Treaty “suspend[s] the prescription period”.*’ Indeed, it
could hardly be any different because, otherwise, a claim could become time-barred during a

pending arbitration.

Moreover, the Respondent itself accepts that the prescription period was in fact suspended for
almost the entire period between the conclusion of Renco J and the filing of the Notice of
Arbitration in the present case, based on the Parties having so agreed. In this regard, the Tribunal
has carefully considered the Respondent’s argument that this agreed suspension merely confirms
the general principle that the respondent State can waive its jurisdictional objections, but that this
is irrelevant to the question of whether the Claimant or the Tribunal can suspend the prescription
period. The Tribunal finds that this argument ignores a decisive difference. It is one thing for a
respondent State simply to choose not to raise a prescription objection in the arbitration (which it
undoubtedly can, even if the Treaty did not allow for any suspension of the prescription period).
It is quite another thing, however, for a respondent State to agree, outside of an arbitration, to a
suspension of the prescription period, which is effectively the same as it agreeing not to raise a
prescription objection in a subsequent arbitration in relation to that period of time. This latter
course of action presupposes that the Tribunal could enforce this agreement, be it on the basis of

an estoppel argument or otherwise, in case the Respondent ultimately raises a prescription

objection in the arbitration in contravention of the agreement (on the basis of the time for which
it previously agreed the prescription period would be suspended). The Respondent’s position
seems to be that the Tribunal could in fact do so and reject the respondent State’s prescription
objection despite more than three years having alleged since the alleged breach. Thus, the
Respondent implicitly acknowledges that the prescription period of Article 10.18.1 is in fact
subject to a suspension in such a scenario, despite no such (or other) suspension being expressly

provided for in the Treaty.

In addition, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt that the Contracting Parties would agree that, if
an arbitral award rendered under the Treaty is annulled for reasons of improper composition of
the tribunal or a violation of due process, the claimant would not be prevented from re-filing the
same claim again even though that (re-)“submission to arbitration” will hardly ever take place
within three years of the alleged breach. Therefore, despite their general statement that the
prescription period is “clear and rigid” and not subject to any “suspension”, the States parties
must be taken to accept that Article 10.18.1 does allow for the prescription period to be suspended
for the pendency of an arbitration, despite its wording not expressly saying anything to this effect.
To hold otherwise would not only create perverse incentives for a respondent State to elicit
grounds for setting aside, it would frustrate a claimant’s due process rights: a successful
vindication of those rights would be rewarded with a prescribed claim.** Such a manifestly
unreasonable result—which flies in the face of the object and purpose of the Treaty under Article

31(1) of the VCLT—also confirms the Tribunal’s interpretation under Article 32(b) of the VCLT.

In any case, even if the Tribunal were to regard the coincident use of the phrase “clear and rigid”
by the Respondent and the US in their respective submissions as constituting or establishing an
agreement on the interpretation or application of the Treaty in the sense of Article 31(3)(a) or (b)
of the VCLT—a point on which the Tribunal need not pronounce itself—the VCLT merely
requires the Tribunal to take such agreement “into account, together with the context”. In other

words, such agreement on questions of interpretation is not binding on the Tribunal.”* Instead, it

is merely one (albeit an important) factor in the interpretative process, together with all others

mentioned in Article 31 of the VCLT.

One other such factor is recourse to “any relevant rules of international law applicable in the
relations between the parties”, pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT. As shown above,
international law—and, more specifically “the general principles of law” recognized under
international law—does provide for a suspension of the prescription period during the pendency
of an arbitration. This, and the necessity of avoiding a claim from becoming prescribed during a
pending arbitration, in particular to allow for resubmission after annulment of a first arbitral
award, squarely confirms what is already suggested by the term “submitted to arbitration” in

Article 10.18.1.

The Contracting Parties could have drafted Article 10.18.1 in a way that requires more than a
claim being “submitted to arbitration” (which term necessarily refers back to Article 10.16.4) for
the prescription period to be suspended, thereby expressly departing from general principles of
law in this regard. However, they chose not to do so. The Tribunal is not prepared to conclude
that a claim “submitted to arbitration” within the meaning of Article 10.16.4 does not suspend the
prescription period merely because the Contracting Parties made coinciding submissions to the
effect that Article 10.18.1 is a “clear and rigid” requirement that is not subject to any “suspension,
prolongation or other qualification”, in circumstances where (i) the Contracting Parties
themselves qualify this general statement; (ii) the plain language of the Treaty does not address
the issue of suspension at all and suggests that the prescription period is satisfied by a claim that
meets the requirements set out in the UNCITRAL Rules; (iii) if at all, the context and object and
purpose of the treaty militate in favor of such a suspension of the prescription period, in particular
to avoid manifestly unreasonable results in case an arbitral award is annulled; and (iv) general
principles of law, which are to be read into the Treaty pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT,?”

Finally, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s contention that the Tribunals in Renco I, Corona
Materials and Waste Management confirmed the Respondent’s position that the prescription
period stops running only if the notice of arbitration meets all jurisdictional and admissibility
requirements.””!

In the paragraph from the Renco J Partial Award referred to by the Respondent in this regard, the
Respondent highlights the term “timing issue”; however, a reading of that entire paragraph shows
that this “timing issue” had nothing to do with prescription, but rather with the view of the
majority of the Renco / tribunal that the Claimant could not retroactively confer it with jurisdiction

by removing the contentious reservation of rights language from its waiver.”

As regards Corona Materials, while the Respondent purports to rely on a finding of that
Tribunal,””? the paragraph of the award to which it refers merely contains a summary of the non-
disputing party submission filed by the US in those proceedings.”” Instead, the Tribunal in that
case found the relevant cut-off date for prescription purposes to be three years prior to the filing
of the notice of arbitration, noting expressly that it did not need to deal with the issue as to whether
a defective waiver may have changed this finding, given that this point was not advanced by the
respondent State.?°°

With respect to Waste Management, it is true, as contended by the Respondent, that the Tribunal
in that case found that a notice of arbitration containing a defective waiver did not amount to a
“submission of a claim” within the meaning of Article 1121 of NAFTA. However, this finding

does not support the Respondent’s case for at least three reasons as follows.

First, Article 1121 of NAFTA has nothing to do with prescription. In fact, the decision in Waste
Management did not concern prescription at all, but rather whether a claim could be submitted to
arbitration for a second time after it was dismissed in a first arbitration for lack of jurisdiction due

to a defective waiver.

Secondly, Article 1121 of NAFTA uses a terminology (“submit a claim”) that is different from
that in Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) of NAFTA (“make a claim’), which are the provisions
dealing with prescription. Hence, contrary to Articles 10.16 and 10.18 of the Treaty in the present
case, which use identical terminology (“submit to arbitration”), it is not at all clear whether the
meaning of those terms in NAFTA must be the same when it comes to the presence of a defective

waiver.

Thirdly, none of the three reasons that the tribunal in Waste Management gave for its
interpretation of Article 1121 of NAFTA support the Respondent’s position that filing a claim

with a defective waiver does not suspend the prescription period of Article 10.18.1.

The first reason given by that Tribunal was very specific language in Article 1121 of NAFTA,

296

viz. the terms “condition precedent” and “only if’,””° none of which is present in Article 10.18.1

of the Treaty.

The second reason was

the underlying purpose of the arbitration provisions in Chapter 11, which was to ‘create
effective procedures... for the resolution of disputes’. An investor in the position of the
Claimant, who had eventually waived any possibility of a local remedy in respect of the
measure in question but found that there was no jurisdiction to consider its claim at the
international level either, might be forgiven for doubting the effectiveness of the international
procedures. The Claimant has not had its NAFTA claim heard on the merits before any
tribunal, national or international; and if the Respondent is right, that situation is now
irrevocable. Such a situation should be avoided if possible.*” (footnote omitted)

 
  

  

 

While, contrary to NAFTA, the Treaty does not explicitly mention as one of its objections the
creation of effective dispute resolution procedures, there can be no doubt that the Contracting

Parties, acting in good faith, must have intended for the Treaty’s dispute resolution mechanism to

be effective. Applying the above reasoning of the Tribunal in Waste Management, it would seem
to run counter to the effectiveness of the system if the Claimant in the present case, after having
eventually submitted a valid waiver (without any relevant time having passed for prescription
purposes after the conclusion of Renco J), is still denied in its request to have its Treaty claim
heard on the merits. In the words of the Tribunal in that case, such a situation should be avoided

if possible.

The third reason given by the Tribunal in Waste Management for its interpretation of Article 1121
of NAFTA was that general international law, which forms part of the governing law under
Article 1131(1) of NAFTA, did not contain any rule in support of the respondent State’s position
that the claim could not be re-filed.?** In the present case, Respondent’s position does not only
lack support in general international law, it even stands in contrast to it.”

In summary, therefore, the Respondent’s position on the suspension of the prescription period is
not supported by the case-law it relied upon in that context. In fact, the precise issue before this
Tribunal has not arisen in any prior case.”

On the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s notice of arbitration and

statement of claim in Renco I suspended the prescription period of Article 10.18.1 -

R. Civiletti, Eduardo Magallén Gémez, James Crawford (President)), {| 36-37 (RLA-78) (the “third”
reason in the line of argument employed by that Tribunal).

 

See section VII.B.2(c)(1) supra.

In the Waste Management saga, Mexico did not raise a prescription objection in the resubmitted arbitration,
even though it arguably could have done so in respect of the majority of the me:
claimant. The key measures invoked, however, still fell within three ye:
Similarly, in Methanex, the US did not raise a prescription objection following an agreement that the
claimant did not claim any violation of NAFTA on the basis of the only measure that potentially ran afoul
of the prescription period. While Apotex did purport to hold that “there is support in previous NAFTA
decisions for the proposition that the limitation period applicable to a discrete government or administrative
measure (such as the FDA decision of 11 April 2006) is not tolled by litigation, or court decisions relating
to the measure”, the decisions referred to do not support that conclusion. Both Mondev and Grand River
dealt only with the question of the date on which the investor acquired knowledge of the alleged breaches
and loss or damage arising therefrom, i.e. the starting date for the prescription period in respect of the
measures alleged—a denial of justice in Mondev and a series of related statutory measures subject to
litigation in Grand River—not any potential suspension of the prescription period. In any event, it is
manifest that a submission to a national court does not constitute a “submission to arbitration” under
Articles 10.16.4 and 10.18.1 of the Treaty or “making a claim” or “submitting a claim” under NAFTA for
the purposes of Articles 1116(2), 1117(2), and 1121 thereof. Apotex Inc. v. United States of America, \CSID

notwithstanding the fact that the Claimant was found, almost five years later, to have submitted a
defective waiver. In this vein, what matters is that the notice of arbitration and statement of claim
in Renco I met the requirements of Articles 3 and 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules”! and, therefore,
amounted to a submission to arbitration within the (identical) meaning of both Articles 10.16.4

and Article 10.18.1.

The Tribunal does not need to decide whether the suspension was triggered on 4 April 2011 (when
the original notice of arbitration and statement of claim was filed) or 9 August 2011 (when the
amended notice of arbitration and statement of claim was filed), because even the latter date was

several months before three years elapsed from the alleged first breach on 10 March 2009.

Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s claims are not time-barred pursuant to
Article 10.18.1.As a result, the Tribunal does not need to pronounce itself on whether, based on
the Respondent’s behaviour in Renco I, the Respondent would have been precluded from

objecting to the Claimant’s claims being prescribed.

Costs of the Preliminary Phase

As a final matter, the Tribunal turns to consider the issue of costs of this preliminary phase of the

proceedings.

Both Parties have requested the Tribunal to order the other Party to bear the full costs of this
preliminary phase.*””

The Tribunal has discretion to award costs under Article 10.20.6 of the Treaty, which provides:

When it decides a respondent’s objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the tribunal may, if
warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney’s fees
incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is
warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant’s claim or the respondent's
objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to
comment.

Notwithstanding its discretion to award costs at this juncture, the Tribunal considers it more

appropriate to defer any decision on costs to a later phase of these proceedings.

The Tribunal notes that this is not disputed between the parties.
