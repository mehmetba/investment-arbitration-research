THE PARTIES

A. The Claimant

Teco Guatemala Holdings LLC, the claimant in this arbitration (“Teco” or “the
Claimant”), is a limited liability company established in 2005 under the laws of the
state of Delaware in the United States of America.

Teco is a subsidiary entirely owned by TECO Energy Inc. (“TECO ENERGY”), a
parent company established under the laws of the state of Florida, United States of
America.

In 1998, another subsidiary of the group TECO ENERGY established in the Cayman
Islands and known as Teco Power Service Corporation de Ultramar Guatemala, S.A.
(“TPS”), together with Iberdrola Energia S.A. (“Iberdrola”) and Electricidade de
Portugal S.A. (“EDP”), formed the Guatemalan company Distribucién Eléctrica
Centro-Americana S.A. (“DECA I”), and through the latter company, acquired 80
percent of the capital of Empresa Eléctrica de Guatemala S.A. (“EEGSA”).

EEGSA is a Guatemalan electricity company. Under Ministerial Agreement No.
OM-158-98 of April 2, 1998 and the Authorization Agreement of May 15, 1998, the
Ministry of Energy and Mines of Guatemala (“MEM”) authorized EEGSA to
distribute electricity in the departments of Guatemala, Sacatepéquez, and Escuintla
for a period of 50 years. Following the privatization of EEGSA, under Ministerial
Agreement No. OM-32-99 of January 11, 1999 and an Authorization Agreement of
February 2, 1999, MEM also authorized EEGSA to distribute electricity in the
departments of Chimaltenango, Santa Rosa and Jalapa for a period of 50 years.

In August 1999, DECA I was absorbed by EEGSA and another Guatemalan
company known as Distribucién Eléctrica Centro-Americana 2 S.A. (“DECA II”)
was created, which became the owner of 80 percent of the capital of EEGSA.

TPS owned 30 percent of the capital of DECA II and the remaining capital of that
company was owned by Iberdrola (49 percent) and by EDP (21 percent).

In 2004, the shares of TPS in DECA II were transferred within the group TECO
ENERGY to another subsidiary known as TWG Non-Merchant Inc., which later
changed its name to TECO Guatemala Inc. In 2005, the shares of DECA II owned by

TECO Guatemala Inc. were transferred to the Claimant.

8. In 2010, DECA II sold its shares in EEGSA to the Colombian firm Empresas
Ptiblicas de Medellin E.S.P. (“EPM”).

11. The Arbitral Tribunal will refer to the Claimant and the Respondent together as “the

Parties”

Il. CONSENT TO ARBITRATION

12. The consent of the Republic of Guatemala to arbitration is established in Article
10.17.1 of the Free Trade Agreement between the Dominican Republic, the United
States of America and Central America (““CAFTA-DR”), which provides that:

“Each Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration under this
Section in Accordance with this Agreement.”
13. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 10.16 of CAFTA-DR, entitled “Submission of a Claim

to Arbitration,” provides that:

“2. At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under this
Section, a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its

intention to submit the claim to arbitration (‘notice of intent’) [...].

3. Provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the
claim, a claimant may submit a claim referred to in paragraph 1:
(a) under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings, provided that both the respondent and the Party of
the claimant are parties to the ICSID Convention [...]”
14. Article 10.18 of CAFTA-DR provides that:
“Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party
J. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three
years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should
have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and
knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)), or
the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or
damage.
2. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless:
(a) the claimant consents in writing to arbitration in accordance with the
procedures set out in this Agreement; and
(b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied,
(i) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), by the
claimant’s written waiver, and
(ii) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(b), by the
claimant’s and the enterprise’s written waivers of any right to initiate or
continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any
Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to

any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.

w

Notwithstanding paragraph 2(b), the claimant (for claims brought under
Article 10.16.1(a)) and the claimant or the enterprise (for claims brought under
Article 10.16.1(b)) may initiate or continue an action that seeks interim
injunctive relief and does not involve the payment of monetary damages before a
judicial or administrative tribunal of the respondent, provided that the action is
brought for the sole purpose of preserving the claimant’s or the enterprise’s

rights and interests during the pendency of the arbitration.”

15. The Claimant expressly consented to arbitration by submitting its request for
arbitration (“Request for Arbitration”) dated October 20, 2010 and satisfied all
requirements provided by the CAFTA-DR for the commencement of the arbitration.!

16. In Accordance with Article 10.18.2(b) of CAFTA-DR, Teco also waived its right to
initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any
of the Parties any proceeding seeking compensation for any measure alleged to
constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16 of CAFTA-DR.”

17. It is undisputed that the Claimant met the requirement of notice of intent, that more
than six months elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim, and that the

requirement of written consent by the Parties to arbitration was met.

Ill. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

18. On January 13, 2009, the Claimant submitted its letter of intent to Guatemala, in
accordance with Article 10.16.2 of CAFTA-DR.

19. On October 20, 2010, the Claimant submitted its Request for Arbitration to the
ICSID Secretariat, in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention.

20. On November 23, 2010, the Secretary-General registered the Claimant’s Request for
Arbitration.

21. On February 11, 2011, the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted, consisting of Professor
William W. Park, appointed by the Claimant, Professor Rodrigo Oreamuno,
appointed by the Respondent, and Mr. Alexis Mourre, appointed jointly by the
Parties to be the President of the Arbitral Tribunal.

22. On March 30, 2011, following a request for disqualification lodged by the Claimant,
Professor Oreamuno declined to serve on the Arbitral Tribunal. On same date, the
Secretary General of the ICSID notified the Parties, in accordance with rule 10(1) of
the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the “Rules”), that the proceeding would remain
suspended in accordance with rule 10(2).

23. On April 5, 2011, the Respondent appointed Dr. Claus von Wobeser as arbitrator and
the Claimant raised no objection to such appointment. Accordingly, on April 21,
2011 the Arbitral Tribunal was reconstituted with the following members: Professor

William W. Park, Dr. Claus von Wobeser, and Mr. Alexis Mourre.

' Exhibit 3 to the Request for Arbitration.
? Exhibit 4 to the Request for Arbitration.

24. On May 23, 2011, in accordance with rule 13(1), the Tribunal held its first session
with the Parties by conference call. The session was recorded and the Arbitral
Tribunal established minutes (“Minutes of the First Session”) which were
transmitted to the Parties on June 14, 2011.

25. The Minutes of the First Session recorded the Parties’ agreement on the rules
applicable to the arbitration and the provisional timetable. The Minutes of the First
session also recorded that the Parties agreed that the Arbitral Tribunal had been
properly constituted and that they had no objections to the appointment of its
members.

26. On September 23, 2011, the Claimant submitted its Memorial (the “Memorial”)
together with factual exhibits C-1 to C-418, legal exhibits CL-1 to CL-56, the
witness statements of Carlos Manuel Bastos (CWS-1), Sandra W. Callahan (CWS-
2), Miguel Francisco Calleja Mediano (CWS-3), Leonardo Giacchino (CWS-4),
Gordon L. Gillette (CWS-5) and Luis Maté (CWS-6), as well as the expert reports of
Rodolfo Alegria Torufio (CER-1) and Brent C. Kaczmarek (CER-2).

27. On October 25, 2011, the Respondent confirmed that it would object to the Arbitral
Tribunal’s jurisdiction, but that it considered that it would be more effective for such
objections to be considered at the same time as the merits. The Respondent therefore
proposed the following schedule of proceedings, which was accepted by the
Claimant and adopted by the Arbitral Tribunal:

“1. Respondent’s memorial on jurisdiction and counter-memorial on the merits to
be submitted on January 24, 2012.

2. Claimant’s counter-memorial on jurisdiction and reply on the merits to be
submitted on May 24, 2012.

3. Respondent’s rejoinder on the merits and jurisdiction to be submitted on
September 24, 2012.”°

28. On December 16, 2011, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, dealing
with certain requests for the production of documents made by the Respondent.

29. On January 24, 2012, the Respondent filed its memorial on jurisdiction and
admissibility and counter-memorial on the merits (the “Counter-Memorial’),
together with factual exhibits R-1 to R-162, legal exhibits RL-1 to RL-17, the

witness statements of Carlos Eduardo Colém Bickford (RWS-1), Enrique Moller

Hernandez (RWS-2), Alejandro Alberto Arnau Sarmiento, Mariana Alvarez
Guerrero and Edgardo Leandro Torres (Mercados Energéticos) (RWS-3), as well as
the expert reports of Manuel A. Abdala and Marcelo A. Schoeters (RER-1), Mario
C. Damonte (RER-2) and Juan Luis Aguilar Salguero (RER-3).

On January 31, 2012, the Claimant requested the Arbitral Tribunal to exclude
exhibits R-102, R-140, R-149, R-150, and R-151 and requested that the Respondent
resubmit its Counter-Memorial after removing the references to such exhibits.

On February 2, 2012, the Claimant requested that paragraph 10.3 of the Minutes of
the First Session be amended. On February 3, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal asked the
Parties to try to reach an agreement on the matter.

On February 9, 2012, the Parties agreed to amend the third paragraph of item 10 of
the Minutes of the First Session concerning the obligation to translate documents by
replacing “including ICSID decisions” with “apart from ICSID or other international
legal decisions.”

On February 10, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued its order on Claimant’s January
31, 2012 request to exclude documents. The Arbitral Tribunal refused to exclude
exhibits R-102, R-149, R-150 and R-151 from the record for such exhibits related to
individuals who had submitted witness statements in the arbitration. Regarding
exhibit R-140, the Arbitral Tribunal removed it from the record but gave the
Respondent the option of replacing it by a document consisting solely of extracts
from the statement made by Mr. Bastos in the Iberdrola arbitration.

On March 21, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 2, dealing
with Claimant’s requests for the production of documents.

On March 28, 2012, the Claimant requested that the Arbitral Tribunal order the
Respondent to produce a clean copy of document G3-25 produced by the Respondent
in response to the Claimant’s request to produce.

On March 30, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal directed the Parties to confer and attempt
to agree on the question of the time-limit for the non-disputing parties’ submissions.
On April 4, 2012, the Respondent informed the Arbitral Tribunal that it agreed to
produce a clean copy of document G3-25, but that such production did not amount to
a waiver of the privilege of communications between the CNEE and its internal or
external legal counsels.

On April 9, 2012, the Parties agreed that the time-limit for the submission of non-

disputing parties’ briefs would be October 8, 2012.

16

39. On April 11, 2012, the Respondent confirmed that it had produced all the documents
ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal in its Procedural Order No. 2.

40. On April 12, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal noted the Parties’ agreement on the time-
limit for the submissions of the non-disputing parties. The non-disputing parties were
notified by the ICSID Secretary General of such time-limit on April 18, 2012.

41. On May 24, 2012, the Claimant filed its reply (the “Reply’”), together with factual
exhibits C-419 to C-594, legal exhibits CL-57 to CL-80, the additional witness
statements of Carlos Manuel Bastos (CWS-7), Sandra W. Callahan (CWS-8),
Miguel Francisco Calleja Mediano (CWS-9), Leonardo Giacchino (CWS-10),
Gordon L. Guillette (CWS-11) and Luis Maté (CWS-12) and the additional expert
reports by Rodolfo Alegria Torufio (CER-3), Fernando Barrera Rey and Carlos
Fernando Barrientos (CER-4) and Brent C. Kaczmarek (CER-5).

42. On September 24, 2012, the Respondent filed its rejoinder (the “Rejoinder”),
together with factual exhibits R-163 to R-208, legal exhibits RL-18 to RL-32, the
additional witness statements of Carlos Eduardo Colom Bickford (RWS-4) and
Enrique Moller Hernandez (RWS-5), and expert reports by Manuel A. Abdala and
Marcelo A. Schoeters (RER-4), Mario C. Damonte (RER-5) and Juan Luis Aguilar
Salguero (RER-6).

43. On September 27, 2012, the Claimant complained that the Respondent had addressed
jurisdictional issues in its Rejoinder, while it had been agreed in the Minutes of the
First Session that the Rejoinder would only deal with the merits. The Claimant
therefore requested an opportunity to answer such jurisdictional arguments.

44. On October 1, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal invited the Parties to “confer and agree on
the organization and agenda of the hearings” and informed them that the Arbitral
Tribunal would hold “a pre-hearing conference call on Tuesday 11 December,
2012."

45. On the same date, the Respondent agreed that the Claimant would respond to its last
jurisdictional arguments no later than November 9, 2012.

46. On October 5, 2012, the Governments of the Dominican Republic and the Republic

briefs.

On October 12, 2012, the Claimant requested that exhibits R-189, R-191, R-193, R-
194, R-195, R-197, R-200 and R-202, as well as any reference to such exhibits in the
Rejoinder or in other documents be excluded from the record.

On October 19, 2012, the Respondent objected to such request.

On October 23°, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal decided to remove from the record
exhibits R-189, R-191, R-193, R-194, R-195, R-197, R-200 and R-202, except for
the parts of document R-202 relating to the evidence of Claimant’s experts and
witnesses whom the Respondent had decided to cross-examine. The Arbitral
Tribunal also ordered the Respondent to remove any reference to such documents in
its Rejoinder or other documents exhibited therewith.

On November 2, 2012, the Parties submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal their proposals
for the organization of the evidentiary hearings.

On November 6, 2012, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder without the
references to the removed exhibits.

On November 8, 2012, the Claimant requested that the Arbitral Tribunal exclude
witness statement RWS-3 and exhibit R-103 from the record since its authors would
not be available for cross-examination at the evidentiary hearings.

On November 9, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal informed the Parties of its decisions
concerning the organization of the evidentiary hearings.

On the same date, the Claimant filed its rejoinder on jurisdiction and admissibility
(“Rejoinder on Jurisdiction”).

On November 15, 2012, the Republic of Honduras submitted a non-disputing party
brief.

On March 1, 2013, Carlos Manuel Bastos, a witness presented by the Claimant, was
examined and cross-examined via videoconference.

On March 8 and 9, 2013, the hearing continued at ICSID in Washington, D.C. The
following witnesses called by the Parties were examined: Leonardo Giacchino,
Enrique Moller and Carlos Colém Bickford, as well as the following experts:
Rodolfo Alegria Torufio, Juan Luis Aguilar Salguero, Fernando Barrera Rey, Mario
C. Damonte, Brent C. Kaczmarek and Manuel A. Abdala.

At the end of the hearing, the Arbitral Tribunal asked the Parties to consult and agree
on the schedule and format of their post-hearing briefs and asked them whether they
had any complaints about the way in which the proceedings had been conducted.
Both Parties replied that they had no complaints in this respect.

On March 18, 2013, the Parties informed the Arbitral Tribunal that they had been
unable to reach an agreement on the schedule and format of their post-hearing briefs.
On March 22, 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal decided that the Parties would submit two
simultaneous rounds of post-hearing briefs. The Arbitral Tribunal did not impose
page limitations but invited the Parties “to make their best efforts to contain the
volume of their briefs, which should not be duplicative of the Parties’ existing
memorials.”"

In the same communication, the Arbitral Tribunal also gave the Parties until July 5,
2013 to simultaneously submit their claims for costs and until July 19, 2013 to
submit any rejoinders to the other party’s claims for costs.

On June 10, 2013, each party submitted its post-hearing brief (“PHB”). Claimant
also submitted exhibits C-626 to C-629.

On June 18, 2013, the Claimant requested the Arbitral Tribunal to exclude certain
information related to the Iberdrola arbitration from Respondent’s PHB. On June 26,
2013, the Respondent objected to such request

On June 25, 2013, the Parties requested the Arbitral Tribunal to modify the schedule
for the remaining filings as follows: Reply PHB on July 8, 2013; submissions on
costs on July 24, 2013, and reply submissions on costs on August 7, 2013. The same
date, the Arbitral Tribunal accepted the Parties’ request.

On June 27, 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal decided that paragraphs 10, 152 and 155 as

well as footnote 18 of Respondent’s PHB would be disregarded. However, for

practical purposes, the Arbitral Tribunal did not request that the Respondent resubmit
its PHB. The Arbitral Tribunal also reminded the Parties “that it will resolve this
case on the basis of the direct oral and written evidence produced in this case, and
that no consideration will be given to either the parties pleadings or the transcripts
in the Iberdrola arbitration, save of course to the limited extent identified in the
Tribunal’s letters of 10 February and 15 October 2012.”

75. On July 8, 2013, each party submitted its second PHB.

76. On July 24, 2013 the Parties simultaneously submitted their claims for expenses and
arbitration costs.

77. On August 7, 2013, the Parties simultaneously submitted their replies on costs. The
Respondent submitted an updated claim for expenses on November 18, 2013, to take
into account the payment of the third advance of fees and costs requested by ICSID
in its letter of 7 August 2013.

78. On November 12, 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal declared the proceeding closed in

accordance with Article 38 of the Rules.

Iv. SUMMARY OF THE FACTS

79. This dispute arose from the alleged violation by the Comisién Nacional de Energia
Eléctrica (National Commission of Electric Energy) (“CNEE”) of the Guatemalan
regulatory framework for setting tariffs for distribution of energy by EEGSA, the

electricity company in which the Claimant had an indirect share.
A. Background of the electricity distribution system in Guatemala

80. At the end of the 1980s, Guatemala’s public electricity sector was facing a series of
difficulties due to insufficient generating capacity.*

81. At that time, electricity generation in Guatemala was controlled by the Instituto
Nacional de Electrificacién (“INDE”), a State-owned body established by decree in
1959 to plan, design, construct, and finance works and facilities and to meet the

electricity needs of the nation,’ while distribution was the responsibility of the

Occidente S.A. (“DEOCSA”), and Distribuidora Eléctrica de Oriente
(DEORSA”),"' all public corporations. EEGSA, although originally a private
electricity-generating company, became in 1977 part of the government electricity
system under the control of the Ministry of Energy and Mines (“MEM”)."? In 1983,
MEM transferred its share in EEGSA to INDE."
The difficulties facing the sector were due, on the one hand, to the fact that INDE
played a dual role of regulator and operator with little or no incentive to operate
efficiently and, on the other, to external factors such as unfavorable climate
conditions, the oil crisis of the 1970s, the depreciation of the Guatemalan currency,
and the country’s debt crisis, which made it difficult for INDE to invest the necessary
funds.’
Because of this situation, Guatemala considered the possibility of privatizing certain
activities in the sector and in 1990 the President of Guatemala, Jorge Serrano,
commissioned through the United States Agency for International Development
(“USAID”) a study of possible options for the privatization of EEGSA.'° On January
11, 1991, Guatemala received a report that had been prepared by Price Waterhouse
between September and November 1990 (the “PW Report’). 6
The PW Report concluded that the time was not yet ripe for privatization of EEGSA,
for four main reasons:
e “Basic subsidy problem is not addressed — Subsidy problems in the power
sector, although large, do not seem critical enough to rush a sale of EEGSA.
This is particularly true because EEGSA is a relatively efficient operator
compared to INDE, and privatizing EEGSA does not address the basic subsidy
problem that would still be present in INDE’s electricity rates.
e Regulatory mechanisms are not established. — The lack of appropriate
regulatory mechanisms could lead to monopoly pricing and sharp tariff

increases if EEGSA were privatized at the present time.

e Expected revenue from sale of EEGSA is low — the current economic situation,
with high inflation, high interest rates, and exchange rate problems makes it a
poor time to privatize due to the very low values that EEGSA is likely to
command under such conditions. The limited interest of foreign investors and
the lack of a local equity market are also issues that reduce the value of
EEGSA to investors.

e EEGSA and INDE are currently too interdependent — EEGSA’s close
relationship and interdependency with INDE would have to be restructured to
eliminate most subsidies and to establish power purchase contracts before any
privatization. Further analysis would be required to examine the future of the
entire Guatemalan electricity system, including INDE and the other electric
distribution companies.” u

The PW Report also estimated the book value of EEGSA’s shares at the time at

US$59.6 million, and its value based on expected cash flows at approximately

US$13.9 million. '®

Between 1991 and 1993, Guatemala increased its electricity tariffs in order to reduce

the need for State subsidies! and in 1992 it started to reorganize INDE and to reduce

its role in electricity generation, allowing private players to become involved in
electricity generation.”

In 1993, the Government of Guatemala, through USAID, commissioned the Chilean

firm Synex Ingenieros Consultores Ltda. (“Synex”) to prepare a report describing the

legal and regulatory framework needed to attain the goals of de-monopolizing and
decentralizing the electricity sector in Guatemala and opening it to private
participation.

Synex submitted its report (“Synex Report”) in June 1993.

The authors of the report, Juan Sebastian Bernstein and Jean Jacques Descazeaux,

mentioned “the need to have clear rules of the game for the operation and

development of the sector [...], particularly as regards generating, transmitting, and
distributing companies, [which] implies defining the rights, obligations and

limitations of the actors participating in the industry, including the government itself.

The need for a general body of laws regulating the functioning of the electric sector
seems to be an absolute need, even more so if the declared objectives are the
disappearance of the directing and normative role of INDE, the entrepreneurial
decentralization of the sector, and the free access of investors to production,
transport and distribution of electricity. Experience shows that, paradoxically, the
functioning of decentralized and competitive schemes requires precise definitions of
each party’s obligations and rights if chaotic conditions are to be avoided in the
industry’s operation and development.

The existing Guatemalan legislation is [...] absolutely insufficient: it will obstruct the
participation of private external investors in competitive generation and
distribution.” *!

In addition, since there was an apparent consensus among industry players that the
regulatory bodies in the electricity industry were not functioning properly,
Guatemala needed “objective rules that define the parties’ obligations and rights,
thus preventing the arbitrary intervention of regulatory entities.”*> The authors
stated that “it would be possible to minimize the intervention of a regulatory
organism in those matters most sensitive to regulation, such as price regulation in
the segments with characteristics of a natural monopoly: transmission and
distribution,” and suggested for that purpose “a specific intervention [...] every five
or 10 years, by a high-level ad-hoc Government entity, for example a Committee
formed by the Ministers of Finance and of Energy and Mines to supervise a tariff
outside study commissioned by the concession holders from a prestigious consulting
agency. The permanent regulatory function would be limited to overseeing
compliance with the law in matters such as safety of facilities [...], even if the
arbitration of conflicting aspects might be given to arbitrating courts appointed by
the parties.”

On December 7, 1994, the Congress of the Republic of Guatemala adopted Decree
64-94, repealing the Law establishing INDE and approving changes designed to de-

monopolize electricity generation and partially deregulate the electricity sector."

Article 50 of the Organic Law on INDE specified that a comprehensive proposal for
the reform of the sector would be submitted to Congress within six months.

92. Messrs. Bernstein and Descazeaux then drafted the new General Electricity Law and
Regulations (the “Draft LGE”), the final version of which was submitted on April 4,
1995.76

93. In their preamble to the Draft LGE, the authors stated that the text must “adhere to
the objectives of de-concentration and de-monopolization defined by the Government
and by a large number of social and political classes of the country, and create the
conditions to attract private investment in generation, transmission, and distribution
of electricity” and stated that, in developing the project, special emphasis had been
placed on “the need to establish transparent and objective regulations for those
activities with the characteristics of a natural monopoly, such as transmission and
distribution.”

94. On September 19, 1996, the Congressional Commission on Energy and Mines issued
a report recommending that Congress should adopt the Draft LGE. In its report, the
Commission indicated that the objectives of the LGE were “the establishment of a
legal framework of general application that provides legal certainty to public and
private investment in the subsector, as a basic condition for the securing of financing
from international credit entities and from national capitals, which seek to invest in
conditions of equality and competitiveness, so as to be able to ensure maximum
benefits of quality and price for electricity services to users and the urgency of taking
the service to the majority of the population—approximately 70 percent—that today
lacks such service...” It also included as the objectives of the LGE “the de-
monopolization and de-politicization of the activities of the subsector, by creating
entities and authorities that regulate and avoid the political interference that has
caused, and can cause, so much distortion and damage, unless clear legal provisions
of general application are established, which is precisely the intent of this law,

seeking, above all, the common good.”*"

B. The new regulatory framework

95. On October 16, 1996, by Decree 93-96, the Congress of Guatemala adopted the

General Electricity Law (“LGE”), which entered into force on November 15, 1996.78
1. The General Electricity Law

a) Creation of the CNEE

96. The LGE created the CNEE, a technical organ with its own functions and budget for
the discharge of its responsibilities and duties.”” The CNEE would be composed of
three members appointed by the Executive Branch every five years, one from each of
three slates proposed by the rectors of universities in Guatemala, the MEM, and
wholesale agents. *°

97. The functions of the CNEE, as established in the LGE, are as follows:

“a) Complying with and enforcing this law and its regulations on matters within
its scope of responsibility and imposing penalties on violators.

b) Watching over and ensuring performance of the obligations of the awardees
and holders of concessions, protecting the rights of users and preventing conduct
that is against free competition, as well as abusive or discriminatory practices.

c) Defining the transmission and distribution rates subject to regulation in
accordance with this law, as well as the methodology for calculation of the same.
d) Settling disputes that arise among agents of the electrical subsector, acting as
arbitrator among the parties when the latter do not reach agreement.

e) Issuing technical regulations relative to the electrical subsector and overseeing
compliance with them consistent with accepted international practices.

Sf) Issuing provisions and regulations to ensure free access to and use of the
transmission lines and distribution networks in accordance with the provisions of

this Law and its regulations.”*!

b) Basis for calculating the tariffs
98. Section IV of the LGE concerns price regulation and Chapter III of that Section deals
with the tariffs applicable to end consumers for final distribution.
*8 Exhibit C-17.
» LGE, art. 4; RLGE, art. 29.

°° LGE, art. 5.
*! LGE, art. 4, English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-17).

26

99. Article 71 of the LGE provides that:
“The rates to end consumers for the final distribution service, in their components
of power and energy, shall be calculated by [the CNEE] as the sum of the
weighted price of all the distributor purchases referenced to the inlet to the
distribution network and the Value Added of Distribution (Valor Agregado de
Distribucién — VAD) [..

 

The VAD is the average cost of capital and operation of a distribution network of

a benchmark-efficient company operating in a given density area.”

100. Article 71 of the LGE follows the “model enterprise” system, whereby VAD does
not reimburse the distributor for its real costs but pays it on the basis of the costs that
a hypothetical efficient company would have incurred.*?

101. According to Article 72 of the LGE, the VAD “shall take into account at least the
following basic components:

a) Costs associated with the user, regardless of its demand for power and energy.

b) Average distribution losses, broken down into their power and energy
components.

c) Costs of capital, operation, and maintenance associated with distribution, stated
by unit of power supplied.”

102. Article 73 provides that “the cost of capital per unit of power shall be calculated as
the constant annuity of cost of capital corresponding to the New Replacement Value
(NRV” or in Spanish original: Valor Nuevo de Reemplazo “VNR”) of an
economically sized distribution network. The annuity will be calculated with the
typical useful life for distribution facilities and the discount rate that is used in
calculation of the rates. The operation and maintenance cost will be that
corresponding to efficient management of the benchmark distribution network.”

103. In this connection, Article 67 of the LGE provides that “the investment annuity shall
be calculated based on the New Replacement Value of the optimally designed
facilities, using the discount rate that is used in the calculation of the rates and a
useful life of thirty (30) years. The New Replacement Value is the cost involved in
building the works and physical assets of the authorization with the technology

available on the market to provide the same service. The concept of economically

*? LGE, art. 71, English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-17).
3 Memorial, § 32; Counter-Memorial, § 146.

27

adapted installation involves recognizing in the New Replacement Value only those

facilities or parts of facilities that are economically justified to provide the required

service.”

104. Article 76 of the LGE specifies that the “rates shall strictly reflect the economic cost
of acquiring and distributing the electric energy.”*>

105. Article 79 refers to the applicable discount rate and states: “the discount rate to be
used in this Law to determine the rates shall be equal to the rate of cost of capital
determined by [the CNEE] through studies commissioned with private entities that
specialize in the matter, and it must reflect the rate of cost of capital for activities of
similar risk in the country. Cost of capital rates different from those for the activities
of transmission and distribution may be used. In any event, if the discount rate
should be less than an annual real rate of seven percent or greater than an annual

real rate of thirteen percent, the latter values, respectively, will be used.”

c) Procedure for calculating the tariffs

106. Regarding the procedure for calculating tariffs, the regulatory framework establishes
that the VAD used to calculate tariffs will be determined on the basis of a study
conducted by a consultant commissioned by each distributor.

107. For this purpose, Article 74 of the LGE provides that “each distributor shall
calculate the VAD components through a study entrusted to an engineering firm
prequalified by the Commission [the CNEE].”

108. These engineering firms were to work under terms of reference drawn up by the
CNEE, which would have the right to monitor the progress of such studies.*°

109. Once completed, the VAD studies would be reviewed by the CNEE, which would be
able to comment on them.*”

110. In case of written objections, Article 75 of the LGE provides that “[the CNEE] and
the distributors shall agree on the appointment of an expert commission (the
“Expert Commission”) made of three members, one appointed by each party and

the third by mutual agreement.” In this case, “The Expert Commission shall

pronounce itself on the differences in a period of 60 days counted from its

appointment.”**

. The LGE specifies that the time-limits for the preparation of such studies, the review,

submission of comments and the appointment of the Expert Commission, would be
set in the Regulation.”

Article 77 of the LGE states that “the methodology for determination of the rates
shall be reviewed by [the CNEE] every five (5) years during the first half of January

of the year in question.”
2. The RLGE

On March 21, 1997, pursuant to the transitory provisions of the LGE, the President
of Guatemala and the MEM issued Government Resolution No. 256-97 containing
the LGE Regulation (the “RLGE”).“° The RLGE was amended successively in
2003,*' 2007,” and 2008.*°

The RLGE, in particular, establishes the parameters for the establishment by the
CNEE of the terms of reference for the studies that distributors were to commission
to consulting firms,“ as well as the deadlines for performing the necessary actions in
the tariff review process.

Regarding the time-limits, the RLGE specifies that the CNEE would deliver the
terms of reference to each distributor every five years, eleven months before the
initial effective date of the tariffs.“

Once the terms of reference had been provided, each distributor would have three
months to submit its tariff study to the CNEE. The study would include the resulting
tariff schedules, the adjustment formulas and a backup report.*°

Thereafter, the CNEE would have one month to approve or reject the studies

submitted by distributors, “making the observations it deems pertinent."

*° Tbid. The original time-limit of three months was extended to four months by the 2007 amendment to the RLGE (Exhibit

118. Once the CNEE had submitted observations, the RLGE provides that:
“The Distributor, through the consultant company, shall analyze the observations,
perform the corrections to the studies, and shall deliver them to [the CNEE]
within the term of fifteen days after receiving the observations. If discrepancies
between [the CNEE] and the Distributor persist, the procedure stipulated in
Article 75 of the Law shall be followed.”*®

119. As noted above, Article 75 of the LGE provides that, in such a case:
“The CNEE] and the distributors shall agree on the appointment of an Expert
Commission made of three members, one appointed by each party and the third by
mutual agreement,” and the Expert Commission “shall rule on the differences in
a period of 60 days counted from its appointment.”

120. The last paragraph of Article 98 of the RLGE established that:
“So long as the Distributor does not deliver the tariff studies or does not perform
the corrections to same, according to what is stipulated in the previous
paragraphs, it may not modify its tariffs and the tariffs in effect at the time of the
termination of the effective term of such tariffs shall continue to apply.”

. However, Article 98 of the RLGE was amended in 2007. On March 2, 2007, the

MEM issued Government Resolution No. 68-2007. Article 98 of the RLGE, as

12

amended by that Government Resolution, reads as follows:
“In case of the Distributor’s failure to deliver the studies or the corrections to

same, the Commission shall be empowered to issue and publish the corresponding

 

iff schedule, based on the tariff study the Commission performs independently
or performing the corrections to the studies begun by the distributor.” 5
122. In 2003, the second paragraph of Article 99 of the RLGE was also amended. Article
99 in its 1998 version provided that:
“Once the tariff study referred to in the previous Articles has been approved, (the
CNEE] shall set the definitive tariff studies [sic] within a term not greater than
one month as of the date on which the definitive study was approved, and shall

publish them no later than April 30, in the Official Gazette. If [the CNEE] has not

effective adjustment formulas, save for what is set forth in the last paragraph of
the previous Article. The tariffs shall apply as of May 1, immediately following the
date of approval by [the CNEE].”*?
In its amended 2003 version, Article 99 provides that:

“If the Commission has not published the new tariffs, the tariffs of the previous
tariff schedule shall continue to be applied, with their adjustment formulas [...] In
no case shall the Final Distribution activity of the electric service be carried out
without an effective tariff schedule. Given the circumstance in which a Distributor
does not have a tariff schedule, the National Electric Energy Commission shall be
responsible for immediately issuing and making effective a tariff schedule so as to

comply with such stated principle.”

C. The privatization of EEGSA

mn

On February 13, 1997, the Government of Guatemala announced its intention to
privatize EEGSA and, on December 17 of that same year, President Alvaro Arzi
issued Government Resolution No. 865-97, authorizing the privatization by public
offering and national and international auction, in accordance with the Law on
Government Procurement, of 96 percent of the EEGSA’s share capital owned by the
State.

According to Government Resolution No. 865-97, EEGSA was responsible for
organizing the public offering™>, for which purpose it established a High-Level
Committee and enlisted the services of Salomon Smith Barney Holdings Inc.
(“Salomon Smith Barney”) as financial consultant.

In April 1998, Salomon Smith Barney prepared a preliminary information
memorandum (the “Preliminary Memorandum”), which was sent to potential
investors, including TECO ENERGY.*°

The Preliminary Memorandum established the goal of selling all EEGSA’s shares as

follows: 80 percent would be offered to strategic investors by national and

percent in 1997) is due to the fact that profits were ploughed back by EEGSA in 1995 (see footnote 12).

international public bidding and the remaining 16.1 percent owned by the State

would be sold to “priority investors” (EEGSA employees, users, and the general

public). The 3.9 percent of shares that Guatemala did not control and that belonged
to private investors would remain under the control of those investors.

The Preliminary Memorandum referred to the regulatory framework as follows:

“Pursuant to the provisions of the Law and the Regulations, tariffs for regulated
customers [...] are set by adding (i) the average cost of energy purchased by the
distribution company [...] and (ii) the valor agregado de distribucién (the Value
Added for Distribution, or ‘VAD’).
Costs of energy purchased that are used to calculate tariffs for regulated
consumers shall be calculated every five years and are based on a model efficient
distribution company. [...] It is the duty of [the CNEE] to ensure that tariffs are
set on a pass-through basis.”*"

After describing the concept of VAD in the LGE and the RLGE, the Preliminary

Memorandum notes that:

“VADs must be calculated by distributors using a study commissioned from an
engineering firm [...]. [The CNEE] will review those studies and may make
observations, but in the event of discrepancy, a Commission of three experts will

be convened to resolve the differences.”**

A few paragraphs later, the Memorandum states that EEGSA had in the past
“subsidized the market, which seriously undermined the company’s financial health.
However, the new Law tackles this problem directly by allowing the companies

(INDE and EEGSA) to set tariffs on the basis of market prices.”

. In May 1998, EEGSA opened a data room and issued the terms of reference for the

public offering,” as well as a memorandum of sale (the “Memorandum of Sale”)°!
and a draft share sale contract. A presentation was also prepared for a road show

(“Road Show”) to take place from May 11 to May 21, 1998.

in the LGE in case of a difference between the CNEE and the distributor:
“VADs must be calculated by distributors by means of a study commissioned from
an engineering firm, but the Commission may dictate that the studies be grouped
by density. [The CNEE] will review those studies and can make observations, but
in the event of discrepancy, a Commission of three experts will be convened to
resolve the differences. The Law states that for the purposes of the tariffs to be
first set in May 1998, [the CNEE] may rely on VADs taken from other countries
applying a similar methodology (such as Chile, Peru, and El Salvador, for
example).”°

In July 1998, the Board of Directors of TECO ENERGY recommended to proceed

with the investment.“

On July 9, 1998, during an internal presentation on the privatization of EEGSA, the

management of TECO ENERGY expressed the view that the contemplated

investment would create opportunities for synergies as well as additional protection

for the group’s existing investments in Guatemala.”

TECO ENERGY decided to participate in the share offering through its entirely

owned subsidiary Teco Power Service Corporation de Ultramar Guatemala, S.A.

(TPS). In order to prepare its bid, TPS formed a consortium (the “Consortium’)

with Iberdrola and EDP.

On July 15, 1998, the Board of Directors of TECO ENERGY authorized TPS to

participate in the offer.”

As required by Article 3.2 of the terms of reference for the public offering, the

Consortium formed a Guatemalan investment company known as Distribucién

Eléctrica Centro Americana, S.A. (DECA I) to acquire EEGSA’s shares. The

participation of the Consortium members in DECA I was as follows: 49 percent for

Tberdrola, 30 percent for TPS and 21 percent for EDP.”

138. On July 30, 1998, after being pre-qualified, the Consortium made an offer of US$520
million for 80 percent of the shares of EEGSA, and was declared the successful
bidder.”

139. The closing took place on September 11, 1998.7!

140. In 1999, DECA I merged with EEGSA, and Iberdrola, TPS and EDP formed a new
Guatemalan company known as Distribucién Eléctrica Centro Americana Dos, S.A.

(DECA II) to be the holding for their participation.”

D. The 1999-2003 tariffs

141. In accordance with the transitory provision 2 of the LGE, the VAD calculation
procedure specified in chapter III of the LGE was not applied to the setting of tariffs
for the initial period following privatization. Instead, the VAD for such initial period
was established on the basis of the values used in other countries following a similar
methodology. In particular, the CNEE used the values applied in El Salvador in the
first quarter of 1996, adjusted to reflect Guatemala’s electricity system and economic
situation.”*

142. On July 17, 1998, the CNEE adopted Resolution No. 15-1998, setting EEGSA tariffs
for the period between July 1, 1998 and June 30, 2003.”

143. According to the Claimant, during the first five-year tariff period, EEGSA was very
successful, increasing its client base and energy consumption and reducing energy
losses and operating costs.”° The Consortium also invested almost US$100 million in
additional capital in EEGSA in order to maintain, modernize, and expand its

network,”° and Teco lent EEGSA over US$11 million.”
E. Tariff review for the period 2003-2008

144. For the setting of tariffs in the next period, on October 9, 2002, the CNEE pre-
qualified six consultants to undertake the distributor’s VAD study.” EEGSA

period.

148. The revision resulted in an increase in EEGSA’s VAD of 12.83 percent (low voltage)
and 70.78 percent (medium voltage).**

tariff review for the period 2008-2013 (“Terms of Reference”).”!

In May 2007, the term of office of the former Board of Directors of the CNEE
expired and the new Board was appointed in the manner specified in the LGE and the
RLGE.” The new Board of Directors of the CNEE was composed of Enrique
Moller, Carlos Colom Bickford and César Augusto Férnandez.”*

On May 8, 2007, EEGSA made an administrative recourse to the CNEE asking for
the revocation of the Terms of Reference.” In particular, EEGSA complained that
the Terms of Reference had laid down methodological and procedural guidelines that
pre-determined the consultant’s VAD study.”° In addition, according to EEGSA, the
Terms of Reference granted the CNEE powers and created obligations for EEGSA
and its consultant that were not provided by the LGE, such as the obligation for the
CNEE to approve each stage of the study before the study could continue and the
possibility that the CNEE could consider the study as undelivered in certain
circumstances for the purposes of Article 98 of the RLGE.”*

On May 11, 2007, EEGSA submitted to the CNEE its detailed comments on the
Terms of Reference.°” In particular, EEGSA proposed the addition of an article
clarifying that the Terms of Reference were guidelines subject to the LGE or the
RLGE, and that the consultant could depart from the Terms of Reference if it could
justify doing so.°8

On May 15, 2007, the CNEE rejected EEGSA’s application for the revocation of the
Terms of Reference.” On May 29, 2007, EEGSA brought an action in court for
protection of its constitutional rights (amparo), requesting that the Terms of

Reference be declared inapplicable (with the exception of items 1.1 and the first

paragraph of item 1.4) because they empowered the CNEE to calculate the
components of the VAD, which was not allowed by the LGE.'”

EEGSA’s claim of amparo submitted that: “in the procedure of the Law, if the
Commission does not agree with the study prepared by the Consultant, the
differences are submitted to the decision of an Expert Commission, which has the
final word. In the procedure of the Impugned Act, if the CNEE does not like the
study, it considers it not delivered and issues its own VAD without any study.”'°!

On June 4, 2007, the sixth Court of first instance in civil proceedings granted
EEGSA’s provisional protection of its constitutional rights (amparo provisional) and
temporarily suspended the application of the Terms of Reference. '2 This protection
was provisionally confirmed by the same court on June 11, 2007,'° pending a
decision on the merits of the case. As will be seen below, the parties subsequently
reached an agreement on the disputed issue and no decision was ultimately made on
the merits.

On June 21, 2007, the CNEE issued Resolution No. 55-2007, pre-qualifying as
consultants to prepare the tariff study the firms PA Consulting, Quantum S.A.,
Mercados Energéticos S.A. (“Mercados Energéticos”), Synex, Bates White LLC
(“Bates White”) and the consortium Sigla S.A./Electrotek (“Sigla”). 04

The CNEE also engaged Alejandro Arnau and Jean Riubrugent, from Mercados
Energéticos, to advise it on the review of the Terms of Reference, in light of the
amendments requested by EEGSA.

On July 27, 2007, the CNEE issued a public bid in view of hiring a consultant that
would assist it during the tariff review.'

On August 1, 2007, EEGSA engaged Bates White as its VAD consultant. The project
director within Bates White was Mr. Giacchino, who had performed the same
function for NERA in the 2003 tariff review process. '°°

On October 26, 2007, the CNEE decided to select Sigla as its own consultant. 107 The

CNEE also received advice from Alejandro Arnau and Jean Riubrugent from

2. The Terms of Reference

165. In the second half of 2007, meetings were held between EEGSA and the CNEE to
discuss the Terms of Reference, during which the CNEE agreed to replace Articles
1.7.4 and 1.9 of the Terms of Reference by new Articles 1.6.4 and 1.8.'°

166. The new Article 1.6.4 eliminated the possibility that the CNEE could interrupt the
consultant’s study if it considered that the stage report did not comply with the
Terms of Reference.

16

x

The new Article 1.8 eliminated the possibility that the CNEE could consider the

study as not delivered under Article 98 of the RLGE if it determined that information

was missing or if it did not agree with the result. Article 1.8 was worded as follows:
“As prescribed in Section 98 of the Rules, the CNEE shall have a period of two (2)
months to evaluate the Study’s Final Report submitted by the Distributor. As a
result of the evaluation, the CNEE shall make such observations as it may deem
necessary. The Distributor shall analyze said observations, make any corrections
it deems appropriate and send the corrected final report of the study to the CNEE
within fifteen (15) days of receiving the observations.”''°

16:

*

The CNEE also agreed to eliminate a public consultation stage originally included in
the April 2007 Terms of Reference. '"!
169. EEGSA and the CNEE also agreed to include a new Article 1.10 in the Terms of
Reference, entitled “Scope of the Terms of Reference’. Article 1.10 was worded as
follows:
“These terms of reference set forth the guidelines to follow in preparation of the
Study, and for each one of its Stages and/or described and defined studies. If there
are changes in the methodologies set forth in the Study Reports, which must be
fully justified, the CNEE shall make such observations regarding the changes as it
deems necessary, confirming that they are consistent with the guidelines for the

Study.

These terms of reference do not constitute a legal or regulatory modification, and
therefore, in case of a controversy between one of the provisions of these terms of
reference and the Law or the Regulations, the provisions of the latter shall
prevail, in all cases applying the principle of legal hierarchy. In addition, any
omission of these terms of reference, relative to aspects defined in the Law and
the Regulations for tariff matters, shall be understood to be incorporated into the
terms of reference.” m2

On August 6, 2007, EEGSA withdrew its request for protection of constitutional
rights''? (amparo) and on October 9, 2007, the CNEE issued Resolution 124-2007,

containing an addendum to the April 2007 Terms of Reference. 4

3. The Bates White VAD study

. On October 29, 2007, Bates White submitted its Stage A report to EEGSA and the

CNEE."?

On November 12, 2007, the CNEE contracted Sigla as its consultant to assist it in the
tariff review process. "6
On the same date, the CNEE asked EEGSA and Bates White to prepare a
presentation on their Stage A report for a technical meeting to be held on November
20, 2007.17

On November 20, 2007, Bates White presented its Stage A report via video
conference to the representatives of EEGSA and the CNEE, and to the CNEE’s
consultants, Mercados Energéticos and Sigla, who met for that purpose in the offices
of EEGSA.

After the meeting, Bates White started to prepare its Stages B and C reports.!!®

On December 17, 2007, the CNEE sent a note to EEGSA stating that the Stage A
report had not been properly submitted. The basis for that statement was that the

formalities for the appointment of EEGSA’s consultant had not been observed and

. On January 17, 2008, the CNEE issued resolutions No. 04-2008 and 05-2008.'*° In

the former, the CNEE set at 7 percent the real annual discount rate to be used to

calculate distribution tariffs.!?!

The latter included an addendum containing
amendments to the Terms of Reference. These amendments contained new
provisions relating to the capital recovery formula, including a 50 percent
depreciation factor. 123

The January 2008 addendum to the Terms of Reference also included new delivery
dates for each stage report, including the Stage A report.

On January 25, 2008, in accordance with the schedule established in the January
2008 addendum, Bates White submitted a new Stage A report, '74 as well as its Stage
B report!?> and a copy of its contract with EEGSA.'*°

On January 30, 2008, the CNEE sent a note to EEGSA stating that, before the reports
could be considered as properly submitted, EEGSA had to provide additional
documentation. '*”

On January 31, 2008, EEGSA sent to the CNEE the requested additional
documents. '*8

On February 12, 2008, the CNEE stated that Bates White’s Stage A report did not
comply with the Terms of Reference and could therefore not be used as a basis for
subsequent reports.'?°

Bates White corrected its report to reflect some of the comments made by the CNEE

On April 11, 2008, the CNEE issued Resolution No. 63-2008, rejecting the study and
directing EEGSA to “perform the corrections to the studies and [...] deliver them to
the Commission within the term of 15 days after receiving the observations.”

On April 22, 2008, a meeting was held between the directors of the CNEE and the
chairman of the Board of EEGSA, Mr. Gonzalo Pérez. At the meeting, Mr. Pérez
gave a presentation on the possibility of increasing the VAD but reducing the tariff
component of energy costs, so that the VAD increase would not affect tariffs. In the
presentation, EEGSA proposed a VAD increase of 10 percent, rather than the
increase of 100 percent that would result from its consultant’s study as corrected on
the basis of the CNEE comments.'*° The CNEE did not respond to such proposal.'*°
EEGSA submitted the corrected Bates White study on May 5, 2008, in which the
consultant accepted some observations made by the CNEE and incorporated the
relevant amendments, but rejected others.'*” On the same day, Mr. Giacchino of
Bates White responded to the observations made by the CNEE on the March 31,

4. Establishment of the Expert Commission and discussion of the Operating

Rules

On May 13, 2008, the CNEE informed EEGSA that it would be necessary to

establish an Expert Commission and invited it to a meeting the next day to discuss its

constitution and working methods. 140

. On May 14, 2008, representatives of EEGSA and the CNEE met again to discuss the

general operating framework. '*! EEGSA rejected the proposals and suggested that
specific rules of procedure should be set, to which the CNEE agreed in principle.“
On May 16, 2008, the CNEE transmitted to EEGSA its Resolution No. 96-2008 of
May 15, 2008, stating in the last paragraph of the preamble that EEGSA had ignored
“all the observations performed by the Commission through said Resolution CNEE-
63-2008, incorporating in the Distribution Value Added Study unsolicited changes
and additional modifications, which consequently altered other elements of the
study; as such, pursuant to current legislation, [the CNEE] is charged with
establishing the discrepancies with the Distribution Value Added Study to then
establish the Expert Commission.”'8

The CNEE consequently decided in Resolution No. 96-2008 “to establish the Expert
Commission referred to in Article 75 of the General Law of Electricity, which must
pronounce itself on the discrepancies in the Study of Empresa Eléctrica de
Guatemala, Sociedad Anonima, listed below, verifying the correct application of the
Terms of Reference (ToR) of the Distribution Value Added Study approved by [the
CNEE].”'* The CNEE listed nine categories of discrepancies to be considered by
the Expert Commission. M5

As regards the membership of the Expert Commission, EEGSA decided to appoint
Mr. Leonardo Giacchino, the Bates White project director, !*° while the CNEE
appointed Mr. Jean Riubrugent, consultant from Mercados Energéticos. '4”

On May 19, 2008, Government Resolution No. 145-2008 added an Article 98 bis to
the RLGE, entitled “Procedure and terms to constitute the Expert Commission,”
establishing that the CNEE and the distributor had three days to form the Expert
Commission, consisting of one expert appointed by each party and a third appointed

Expert Commission, that member would be appointed by the MEM from amongst

the candidates proposed by the parties. “8

Although EEGSA agreed that Bates White would have to correct the study in order

to reflect the Expert Commission’s pronouncements'*!, there was no agreement as to

who would then assess whether such corrections properly reflected the Expert

Commission’s views. The CNEE proposed that it would have to make such

determination itself, 2 while EEGSA considered that the Expert Commission would

have to ascertain whether the corrections correctly reflected its views. 153

199. On May 21, 2008, following a meeting with EEGSA, the CNEE proposed new draft
Operating Rules, providing that the CNEE would review and approve the corrections
in the light of the opinions of the Expert Commission. '*

200. On May 23, 2008, EEGSA complained that the Resolution No. 96-2008 had
unilaterally and arbitrarily established the discrepancies to be resolved by the Expert
Commission, including items to which the CNEE had not previously objected.'*°

According to EEGSA, the Resolution constituted “a violation of the guarantees of

National Treatment and Minimum Treatment Level, as well as a constructive

expropriation attempt of [EEGSA], according to what is stipulated in several

99156

international treaties to which Guatemala is a party.

On May 28, 2008, the President of the CNEE, Carlos Colom, proposed that Carlos
Bastos should be appointed to chair the Expert Commission. EEGSA agreed, after
informing the CNEE that Mr. Bastos had in the past participated in a small project
for EEGSA on the wholesale electricity market. tel

On June 2, 2008, Mr. Calleja of EEGSA forwarded to Mr. Bastos the e-mail from
Mr. Quijivix dated May 28, 2008, with the last draft of the proposed Operating
Rules.'® The Claimant submits that Mr. Calleja informed Mr. Quijivix that he had

'S but the Respondent denies having been informed of this. tot

done so,
A few days later, the CNEE, EEGSA, and Mr. Bastos discussed certain
administrative matters relating to the proceedings to be followed before the Expert
Commission.'°

On June 6, 2008, the CNEE and EEGSA signed the deed of appointment of the
Expert Commission. On June 12, 2008, the experts informed both parties that they
were assuming their functions and described their understanding of their mission. '©°
On June 26, 2008, the chairman of the Expert Commission, Mr. Carlos Bastos,

signed separate service contracts with the CNEE'” and with EEGSA.'®
5. The Expert Commission’s report and its dissolution

On July 23 and 24, 2008, certain Guatemalan newspapers published articles
reproducing statements made by the President of the CNEE, Mr. Colom, according to
which the Expert Commission’s report would not be binding and would only be
considered as recommendations that the CNEE could elect to implement.'

On July 25, 2008, the Expert Commission delivered its report to the CNEE and to
EEGSA.'” On the same date, the CNEE adopted its Resolution No. 3121, dissolving
the Expert Commission.

In its report, the Expert Commission summarized its findings as follows:

“The issue is to discern whether the Consultant’s Tariff Study, considering the
ToR as guidelines, has performed a task that is in accordance with the
requirements of the Law and the Regulations, or otherwise determine if given the
justifications of the deviations, the CNEE maintained and certifies that the

requirements of the ToR better reflect the requirements of the Law.”"”!

- On July 28, 2008, Mr. Giacchino of Bates White sent a letter to the Expert

Commission, with a copy to the CNEE and EEGSA, stating that the Bates White
study has been modified “taking into account the decisions of the Expert Commission
[...] for your verification that the changes made do faithfully reflect the decision of
the Expert Commission.” mm

EEGSA also sent to the CNEE, along with a copy of Bates White’s letter mentioned
above, copies of the revised stage reports and a CD with the supporting files.'” The
final revised Bates White study calculated an VNR of US$1,053 million.!”*

On even date, the CNEE notified EEGSA of its Resolution No. 3121 dissolving the
Expert Commission.'”

On the same day, the CNEE wrote to Mr. Bastos acknowledging receipt of the
Expert Commission’s report, and informing him that “the activities corresponding to
the execution of [his] contract ended July 25, with the delivery of the referenced

report.” 176

6. Calculation of tariffs for the 2008-2013 period and actions brought by EEGSA

On July 29, 2008, EEGSA brought an action for the protection of its constitutional
tights (amparo), requesting that CNEE’s Resolution No. 3121 be reversed and that
the CNEE be ordered to comply with the Expert Commission’s report.!77 EEGSA
informed the members of the Expert Commission that its recourse had the effect of
suspending the CNEE’s Resolution and that the Expert Commission should therefore

proceed to review whether the Bates White study reflected its opinions. 7°

216. On the same date, Mr. Bastos sent a letter to the other members of the Expert
Commission inviting them to a meeting to analyze the last version of the Bates
White’s study.'” Mr. Riubrugent, the member of the Expert Commission appointed
by the CNEE, confirmed on July 30 that he would participate by conference call. 180

217. On July 30, 2008, the Court of first instance of Guatemala admitted EEGSA’s
recourse of amparo and provisionally ordered the CNEE to “comply in full with the
decision of the Expert Commission, allowing it to conclude its work, especially the
final review of the changes presented to the Expert Commission by the firm Bates
White”, and to “abstain from using mechanisms tending to manipulate, change or
unilaterally interpret those changes already approved.” 8!

218. However, on the same day, the Court suspended the amparo proceedings on the
grounds that EEGSA had not exhausted the available administrative remedies. 182

219. On July 31, 2008, Mr. Riubrugent informed Mr. Giacchino and Mr. Bastos that, in
view of the situation and of instructions given to him by the CNEE regarding the end
of his obligations and the fact that he might be overstepping his authority, he would
not participate in the conference call scheduled for July 31,183

220. The experts Bastos and Giacchino nonetheless met at Bates White’s offices in
Washington D.C.

221. On the following day, both experts sent a letter to the CNEE and EEGSA announcing
that they had reviewed all the documents concerning the tariff calculation and
verified that all the Expert Commission’s pronouncements had been implemented in
Bates White’s July 28, 2008 revised study. 184

222. On even date, the CNEE issued Resolutions No. 144-2008, 145-2008, and 146-2008.

223. In Resolution No. 144-2008, dated July 29, 2008, the CNEE stated that the Expert
Commission’s report had confirmed that Bates White’s May 2008 study had failed
“to correct all of the observations made... through said Resolution CNEE-63-2008.”
Consequently, in accordance with Articles 98 and 99 of the RLGE, the CNEE was

empowered to set the tariffs on the basis of its own VAD study. 185

In Resolutions No.145-2008 and 146-2008, the CNEE set the tariffs and periodic
adjustment formulas for EEGSA clients, effective August 1, 2008 and July 31,
2013,'%° on the basis of the Sigla study. 187

The Sigla study adopted the Capital Recovery Factor (“CRF” or in its Spanish
original: Factor de Recuperacién de Capital “FRC”) set forth in the Terms of
Reference and consequently depreciated the VNR by 50 percent. '** In addition the
Sigla study used 2006 prices for its calculation instead of the prices available in
2007,'* and applied a different method for determining the density of demand in the
EEGSA distribution area.'”°

The Sigla study concluded to an VNR of US$465.3 million (implying a VAD of
US$85 million). Such VNR was lower than the VNR that had been calculated for the
2003-2008 tariff period, which was US$583.7 million. '*!

On August 1, 2008, EEGSA initiated administrative recourses against Resolutions
No. 144-2008, 145-2008 and 146-2008.'? On August 12, it filed an action of

amparo requesting protection against the CNEE Resolution No. 3121.'3

. In August 2008, EEGSA unsuccessfully met with the CNEE and with Guatemalan

government officials in an attempt to reach an agreement on the applicable tariffs. 14

On August 20, 2008, the MEM rejected the administrative recourse against
Resolutions No. 144-2008, 145-2008 and 146-2008.'°° The basis for the MEM’s
decision was that these resolutions were not directed to individuals but were rather
texts of a general nature applying to all consumers of EEGSA’s electricity
distribution service. '°°

EEGSA started to invoice using the new tariffs on August 21, 2008.'°7

On August 26, 2008, EEGSA brought a second action for constitutional protection
against Resolution No. 144-2008.

232. On May 15, 2009, the second Civil Court of first instance granted EEGSA protection
against Resolution No. 144-2008,'°* and on August 31, 2009 the eighth Civil Court
of first instance granted protection against CNEE Ruling 3121 and ordered the
CNEE to issue a new resolution guaranteeing the right of defense and the principles
of due process and legality, “allowing the Expert Commission to fulfill the purpose
for which it was created in the first place.” 199

233. The CNEE subsequently appealed against these judicial decisions and, in a majority
decision dated November 18, 2009, the Constitutional Court reversed the judgment
of the second civil court of first instance, thus putting an end to the judicial
proceedings against Resolution No. 144-2008.7

234. Such decision reads in its relevant parts as follows:
“Expecting the Expert Commission to decide a conflict and empowering it to issue
a binding decision breaches the principle of legality of the Rule of Law, and this is
because even if persons can do anything [that is] not forbidden by the law (Section
5 of the Constitution), authorities can only do what the law allows them to do
(Section 154 ibidem); therefore, if we only consider the General Electricity Law,
the power to approve tariff schemes is vested in the National Electricity
Commission and in no way, whether directly or indirectly, in an expert
commission, the nature of which has been considered.
[..]
Understanding that the members in charge of the experts’ study have a further
role or that their report is binding breaches Section 154, paragraph three, of the
Constitution, which forbids the delegation of duties, unless authorized by law,
which is not the case under the General Electricity Law, which does not contain
any provisions transferring the power to set forth or issue the tariff scheme for the
five-year period to the Expert Commission.
It is evident that the National Electricity Commission, not having the obligation to
be bound by the opinion issued by the Expert Commission, caused no damage to
its counterparty by deciding to dissolve the Expert Commission, taking into
consideration that its purpose had been fulfilled and, therefore, the right to due
process invoked in the amparo action herein has been observed in all its phases.

8 Exhibit C-328.

® Exhibit C-330.
2 Exhibit C-331.

48

The role of the National Electricity Commission of fixing the tariff schemes is a
legitimate power granted by the General Electricity Law whereby it represents the
State, and regulated in Sections 60, 61, 7,1 and 73 of the mentioned law, which
must restrict any discretional excess, since it refers to verifiable concepts stating
that those tariffs ‘must be compatible with standard distribution costs of efficient
companies,’ structured ‘to promote equal treatment of consumers and the sector’s
economic efficiency,’ that ‘the Distribution Added Value shall be related to the
average capital and operations costs of a distribution network of an efficient
company of reference,’ and, likewise that the ‘cost of operation and maintenance
shall correspond to an efficient management of the reference distribution
network.’ It is estimated that tariffs fixed, when the report by the Expert
Commission has not been accepted as valid to guide this policy, cannot be, within
its discretion, harmful or unreasonably arbitrary, in view of the indicators of
efficient operators as a reference, as the one conditioned in temporary Section 2
of the related Law, which made reference to the ‘values used in other countries
applying a similar methodology.’ However, the rationality of the tariff schemes
approved was not reported as damage or as evidence in this amparo action, and
the only damage reported focused on the concept of legal due process, which was
already analyzed (paragraph a) of section VI of the conclusions).”>'

235. In a second judgment, dated February 24, 2010, the Constitutional Court reversed the
judgment of the eighth civil court of first instance and considered that the dissolution
of the Expert Commission could not be damaging to EEGSA, since the
Commission’s report was not binding on the CNEE. The judgment reads as follows:

“... it should be noted that Sections 75 and 77 of the General Electricity Law and
the third paragraph of Section 98 and Section 98 bis of its Rules set forth the
procedure to create the Expert Commission and the time frame for the
Commission to meet and to issue an opinion on the matters submitted thereto: the
discrepancies arising from the tariff study based on the terms of reference. In the
case at hand, the Expert Commission was created in compliance with the relevant
Law and its Rules and, within the statutory period, issued its opinion on the
discrepancies found by the National Electricity Commission between the tariff

study submitted by the petitioner and the terms of reference previously set by the
2! Ibid., p. 18 et seq., English translation provided by the Claimant.

49

respondent authority. It should be pointed out that the Law and its Rules—the
only Guatemalan legal rules applicable in the case—empower the Expert
Commission only to issue its opinion on the above-mentioned discrepancies. In
submitting its opinion, the Expert Commission performed the duty imposed
thereon by the Law and its Rules. Therefore, given that it had already fulfilled its
legal purpose, that it was a temporary rather than a permanent commission
empowered to issue an opinion enabling the competent authority to set the tariffs,
and that it had to meet no other duty in the proceedings, the dissolution of the
commission could by no means cause damage to the petitioner because the
respondent authority merely followed the procedure established by the Law and
its Rules.”

[..]

As ruled on this issue by the Court [...], in relation to the nature of the experts’
opinion discussed herein, it is worthy of note that ‘Expertise understood as
wisdom, practice, experience, or skill in a science and art, has traditionally been
used as an aid to which authorities resort when they need to make a decision
regarding a certain subject. An expert is an assistant who provides an opinion on
the best decision, although, pursuant to common legislation and Guatemalan
legal practice, it is understood that scientific and technical knowledge do not
constitute a judgment, but rather elements to guide the decision to be made by the
authorities. Therefore, the authority making the decision has no obligation to base
such decision on the experts’ opinions...’ Additionally, in reference to the scope
of opinions like this, this Court has held that: ‘Regarding its scope, the opinion is
not binding upon the body seeking the advice whenever books of authority classify
it as optional—advice that the Administration is not obliged to require—or
compulsory—advice that is expressly necessary pursuant to the law—unless the
opinion is expressly binding, as required by law and as a basis for the
administrative decision.’ [...]

Based on the above remarks, requiring the Expert Commission to solve the
dispute between the petitioner and the respondent authority; granting it
jurisdiction to issue a binding decision; and even empowering it to approve the
tariff studies, as the Court held, would violate the well-developed legality
principle of the Rule of Law and would infringe the principle of public office

subject to the law, because the General Electricity Law [...] entitle[s] the

50

National Electricity Commission, as the only responsible agency, to set
distribution tariffs and to approve tariff studies [...], which constitutes a public
duty that, in keeping with Section 154 of the Guatemalan Constitution, may not be
delegated.

[..]

. in the Guatemalan legal system, the National Electricity Commission shall
review the studies conducted by the distributor and, in the event of discrepancies,
shall appoint an Expert Commission, which shall issue an opinion on the
discrepancies within 60 days following its creation. The Rules provide that, if the
Distributor fails to send the studies or corrections to those studies, the National
Electricity Commission (governmental agency of public law) may issue and
publish the related tariff scheme based on the tariff study prepared independently
by the commission or making the necessary corrections to the studies prepared by
the distributor. [...] In view of the above, the National Electricity Commission
caused no damage to the petitioner when it dissolved the Expert Commission and
when it followed the procedure to devise the tariff schemes, given that such task—
a state duty, as has been pointed out—is a lawful power granted by Sections 60,

61, 71 and 73 of the General Electricity Law.”?”
7. Sale of Teco’s shares in EEGSA

236. In mid-2010, the Colombian firm EPM informed Iberdrola that it was interested in
purchasing EEGSA. Teco and its partners started negotiations to sell DECA II to
EPM and, after a few weeks of negotiations, on October 6, 2010, EPM made the

Consortium a firm offer to purchase DECA II for US$605 million.2°

Teco’s share of
the price for its 30 percent ownership of DECA II was US$181.5 million.2™

On October 21, 2010, the Consortium and EPM closed the sale of DECA II for the
amount specified in EPM’s offer of October 6, 2010.75

V. POSITION OF THE PARTIES ON JURISDICTION
A. Summary of Respondent’s position

238. The Respondent contends that: (1) the case stated by the Claimant is nothing more
than a regulatory disagreement on the interpretation of Guatemalan domestic law, the
interpretation of which is not a matter for this Arbitral Tribunal but for the
Guatemalan courts, which have already decided the issue. According to the
Respondent (2) the Claimant cannot use an international mechanism to file an appeal
against the decisions of the Supreme Court of Guatemala and could only have
challenged those decisions under international law by presenting a denial of justice
claim. This has not been done, however, and there has been no allegation by the
Claimant in this regard. Finally, (3) the Respondent cites the decision of the Arbitral

Tribunal in the Iberdrola case.
1. Teco’s claim is a mere regulatory disagreement

239. Guatemala contends that the Claimant’s claim is essentially based on its
disagreement with the way the Guatemalan regulator interpreted and applied the
regulatory framework in the tariff review process for 2008-201 3.208

24

S

Although the Claimant refers to the amendments to Article 98 RLGE in 2007 and
2008, such is not the basis for its claim. What Claimant submits is that such
provision, as amended in 2007, was incorrectly applied by the CNEE. In addition,
Teco never complained about the 2007 amendment before this arbitration, and such a
claim would now be time-barred. With respect to the 2008 amendment, Claimant
admits that it was not applied, and therefore could not have caused Teco any harm.2”
241. The Claimant’s claim is therefore limited to the CNEE’s interpretation of the
Guatemalan regulatory framework concerning the role of the Expert Commission
and the regulator’s power to approve the VAD and EEGSA’s rate of return based on
a tariff study prepared by its own consultant rather than by the distributor’s
consultant.?
242. Respondent argues that such regulatory disagreements cannot give rise to claims
under the Treaty because the CNEE has the right and duty to interpret the law and

28 Counter-Memorial, §§ 55 and 78; Rejoinder, §§ 40 et seq.

take positions on issues that are within its jurisdiction. The General Electricity Law
(LGE) itself and its regulations provide that the CNEE is the party responsible for
complying with and enforcing these laws,?” and in particular they provide that the
CNEE has the responsibility to “define the transmission and distribution tariffs [...]
as well as the methodology for calculation of the same” and to conduct the tariff
review process,”!°

243. Even if the regulator was mistaken in its interpretation of the regulatory framework,
this cannot result in a violation of an international treaty, particularly when local
courts have already decided on the matter.”!

244. The Claimant itself realized that their differences in respect to the regulatory
framework should be brought before the courts of Guatemala. The Claimant and
EEGSA challenged the April 2008 Terms of Reference before the Guatemalan courts
and obtained a temporary protection measure. The Claimant also raised their
differences regarding the procedure for fixing the tariffs before the courts of
Guatemala, and in particular the interpretation of the role of the Expert Commission;
these appeals were admitted and processed by the courts of Guatemala, but
ultimately the Constitutional Court decided in favor of the CNEE.

245. On November 18, 2009, the Constitutional Court decided whether the ruling of the
Expert Commission was binding, as well as on the disputed extent of the regulator’s
power to set the tariff based on its own consultant’s VAD study. The Respondent
summarizes as follows what is in its view the content of the court’s decisions in this
respect: “a) The CNEE is the only entity empowered to approve the tariffs and is not
authorized to delegate this function; (b) The Expert Commission has the sole
function of issuing a pronouncement on discrepancies between the VAD study
submitted by the distributor and the Terms of Reference issued by the CNEE; (c) The
regulatory framework does not establish any additional function for the Expert
Commission after it has issued its pronouncement; (d) Because of the advisory
nature of expert reports under Guatemalan law and the responsibility of the CNEE to
approve the tariffs, the pronouncement of the Expert Commission cannot be binding;

and (e) Finally, the Court affirmed the regulatory nature of the CNEE’s function to

 

2 Counter-Memorial, § 56.
21 Thid., § 57; LGE art: 4 61 and 71.
21! Counter-Memorial, § 1

 

53

approve the tariffs, which must reflect legal criteria, in particular the costs,

including the cost of capital.”?'?

246. The Respondent further asserts that, in its decision of February 24, 2010, the
Constitutional Court found that: “(a) the relevant legislation does not grant the
Expert Commission any function other than to issue a pronouncement on the
discrepancies between the CNEE and the distributor; (b) the dissolution of the
Expert Commission once its pronouncement had already been issued could not have
caused harm to EEGSA; and (c) given the advisory nature of expert pronouncements
under Guatemalan law and the non-delegable nature of the CNEE’s duties and
responsibilities regarding adoption of the tariffs, according to the principles of
legality and organization of the public administration, the pronouncement of the

Expert Commission cannot be binding.”?"

2. The Claimant cannot file an appeal before the Arbitral Tribunal against the

 

 

decisions of the Guatemalan courts, it can only file a claim for denial of justice

but it has not done so

24

Xn

. According to Guatemala, the Claimant is now asking the Arbitral Tribunal to act as
an appellate court on these issues, which, is not possible, as has been established by
many investment arbitration tribunals.?'* The Claimant could only have submitted an
international claim if it had claimed and proved that there was a denial of justice,
which it has not alleged.?"°

248. When disagreements between a regulator and the regulated entities arise, what the

State must ensure is that its courts are available to provide due process and do not

issue arbitrary decisions. A State is internationally responsible only when this

but also includes the actions of its courts.”'®

249. In this regard, the Respondent contends that the Claimant only alleges that the
decisions of the Constitutional Court were wrong or incorrect and that they appear to
have been “influenced by political considerations,” but does not provide any
substantiation, foundation, or evidence whatsoever for such contentions.?!”

250. To the contrary, the Guatemala’s Constitutional Court granted the Claimant a full
opportunity to expound its arguments and issued reasoned and informed decisions.
Moreover, the Constitutional Court has repeatedly demonstrated its independence

from political power.7/*

. The Respondent asserts that its position on the lack of jurisdiction of the Arbitral
Tribunal is supported by the decision of the tribunal in the Iberdrola case.?!?

N

. The Iberdrola case is identical to the present case as to the facts. On the same facts,
the Arbitral Tribunal decided that it was dealing with a claim under Guatemalan law
and not international law, and that in order to deal with such claims it “would have to
act as regulatory authority, as administrative entity and as trial court.” As a
consequence, after dismissing the denial of justice claim, the Iberdrola tribunal
concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to decide the case.?”°

Respondent also notes that the Iberdrola case was based on the BIT between Spain
and Guatemala, under which the autonomous standard of treatment is more
demanding than the international minimum standard applicable to this case. Even so,

the tribunal found that the claims were not justiciable under international law”?!
B. Summary of Claimant’s position

254. According to Teco: (1) the claim concerns a violation of the Treaty and is not merely
a regulatory disagreement. In any case (2) the Claimant argues that the basis for its

claims is something that should be decided on the merits. Teco also argues that (3) it

is not limited to bringing a claim for denial of justice, and that (4) the decision in

Tberdrola is not relevant to the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal.

1. Teco’s claim relates to a violation of the Treaty and is not a mere regulatory

 

 

greement

Respondent’s jurisdictional objections are unfounded and should be rejected because
the Claimant is not pleading a mere regulatory disagreement. Nor is it asking the
Arbitral Tribunal to act as an extraordinary court of appeal. What Claimant is asking
for is a review of Guatemala’s actions during the 2008-2013 tariff review process, in
light of Respondent’s obligation under Article 10.5 of the Treaty to accord Teco’s
investment fair and equitable treatment.?”?

The Claimant does not require the Arbitral Tribunal to act as a regulatory body or as
an extraordinary court of appeal. Teco is in fact not asking the Arbitral Tribunal to
decide whether the decisions of the Expert Commission were correct. Nor is it asking
that it conducts a new tariff review for the 2008-2013 period or that it reviews
Guatemalan court decisions. The point Teco is raising in this arbitration is that
Guatemala was under an international obligation to comply with the Expert
Commission’s decisions, regardless of whether such decisions were correct as a
technical matter under Guatemalan law. What the Arbitral Tribunal must decide is
whether Guatemala acted contrary to its previous actions, in violation of the
Claimant’s legitimate expectations, or arbitrarily and in bad faith in re-calculating
EEGSA’s VAD for the 2008-2013 period. The Arbitral Tribunal is also called to
decide whether there was a fundamental change to the legal and regulatory
framework and therefore a violation of the Respondent’s obligations under the

Treaty. 223

2. Teco’s claims are to be decided in the merits

. According to the Claimant, in assessing its jurisdiction, the Arbitral Tribunal needs

not establish that the claims are correct in substance. It is sufficient that it establishes

that the facts alleged by the Claimant, if proved, would be likely to fall within the

2 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, § 3.
3 Reply, §§ 8, 246 et seq.; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, § 14.

56

Treaty provisions. 24 This approach is supported by a long line of consistent arbitral
decisions.””° The Claimant avers that its claim and the underlying facts comply with
the above requirement because, if proven, they would constitute a breach of the
Treaty.”

25

*

Although the Respondent cited several decisions to support its allegations of lack of

7

jurisdiction,” it failed to cite a single decision in which a tribunal declined

jurisdiction in the circumstances of the present case.”"* This shows that the decision
on whether this claim turns on a mere difference of opinion over regulatory
interpretation or on a violation of the Treaty is a matter to be decided in the merits

and cannot form the basis for a jurisdictional objection.”

3. The Claimant is not limited to arguing denial of justice

259. Contrary to Respondent’s contentions, the decisions made by the Constitutional
Court of Guatemala do not deprive the Arbitration Tribunal of its jurisdiction, nor do
they limit the Claimant to making a claim for denial of justice.”

260. As a matter of fact, such decisions have no res judicata effect with respect to the
Claimant, as the causes of action in the present proceedings are different from those
present in the Iberdrola arbitration. The parties involved are also different. Moreover,

the fact that a domestic court has found the CNEE’s actions to be lawful does not

4. The arbitral tribunal’s decision in Iberdrola is not relevant to reviewing the
Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction in this case

232

261. The Claimant also avers that the decision in Iberdrola~~ is not relevant because of

the different way in which that case was presented,”**

262. In addition, the Claimant alleges that the Iberdrola tribunal erred to the extent that it
concluded it did not have jurisdiction to consider issues of domestic law in a
regulatory context, as investment tribunals frequently rule on issues of domestic law
in determining whether there has been a breach of an investment treaty.*

26.

»

Finally, Teco submits that, in the Iberdrola case, the Arbitral Tribunal failed to
analyze or even consider the claims relating to the legitimate expectations. In the
present case it cannot be said that Teco’s legitimate expectations arguments concern
a mere regulatory disagreement under Guatemalan law. In fact, according to the
Claimant, this is an aspect that does not depend at all upon the correct interpretation

of Guatemalan law.?*°

imposing an unreasonably low VAD on EEGSA, and in doing so (2) it caused the

Claimant to suffer damages for which compensation has to be paid.
1. Guatemala violated its obligation under Article 10.5 of the Treaty

265. The Claimant argues that Guatemala violated its obligation of fair and equitable
treatment, first (a) when it modified fundamentally the legal and regulatory
framework, contrary to its representations, thus frustrating Teco’s legitimate
expectations and, second, (b) when it engaged in unfair and arbitrary actions during
the 2008-2013 tariff review process, with the intent of controlling the process and its
outcome. According to Teco, (c) Respondent’s actions constitute breaches of Article

10.5 of the Treaty.

a) The fundamental modification of the regulatory framework and the violation of
Claimant’s legitimate expectations
266. Teco argues that Guatemala made representations to the Claimant that were designed
to induce it to invest in the country’s electricity sector, and that after having obtained
the benefit of a high price for EEGSA’s shares, the Respondent frustrated Teco’s
legitimate expectations.

Contrary to the submissions of the Respondent, States are liable for failing to respect

. In respect of Guatemala’s argument that Teco did not exist at the time of EEGSA’s
privatization, the Claimant asserts that Teco is part of the same group of companies
that originally acquired EEGSA, and that the acquisition in 2005 was merely an
internal corporate transfer within the group. Moreover, according to Teco, the
companies involved shared virtually all the same officers and directors.?**
Accordingly, the Claimant argues that Teco shared the expectations of the other

by virtue of the specific provisions of the LGE and the RLGE,”° as well as the

‘and in the Memorandum of Sale™” to

statements it made during the road show”
promote the sale of EEGSA’s shares — made the following representations, which it
immediately thereafter betrayed: (i) that the VAD would be calculated based on a
study commissioned by the distributor; (ii) that the VAD would be calculated on the
basis of the VNR of a distribution network of a model efficient company; and (iii)
that, in case of discrepancies between EEGSA and the CNEE on the VAD study, the

discrepancies would be resolved by an independent Expert Commission.

i. The VAD would be calculated based on the study submitted by the
distributor

The Respondent made representations on several occasions according to which

VADs must be calculated by a consultant chosen by the distributor.°

. Article 74 of the LGE provides specifically that the VAD components should be

calculated by the distributor through a study conducted by one of the firms
prequalified by the CNEE.

The Memorandum of Sale also stated that the VAD was to be calculated by
distributors by means of a study commissioned from an engineering firm?

Teco avers that such representations implied an essential guarantee for the investor,
assuring the latter that it would play an important role in the setting of the VAD. This
was an essential part of the balancing that the LGE struck between the distributor and
the regulator in the tariff review process."

The Respondent nonetheless amended Article 98 of the LGE in 2007 to give the
CNEE an option, in certain cases, to set the VAD on the basis of a study prepared by

its own consultant rather than by the distributor’ s.7%°

. According to the Claimant, such an amendment was contrary to Guatemala’s

representation that the VAD would be established based on a study provided by the

distributor, which involved a system of checks and balances between the regulatory

authority and the distributors so that the tariffs would be set on the basis of objective
and impartial criteria.7*’ Teco states that the amendment was also unconstitutional, as
it modified a statutory provision by regulation,”"*

Teco argues that, despite the illegality of said amendment, it decided not to challenge
it in 2007, first because it considered that the new provision would not be applicable
to it because EEGSA planned on submitting its consultant’s studies to the CNEE in a
timely and complete manner, and second because it did not want to strain its
relationship with the CNEE at a time when the 2008 tariff review process was about
to begin.”

This amendment provided support to the November 18, 2009 decision of the
Constitutional Court of Guatemala, in which the court approved the CNEE’s decision
to apply its own tariff.°°° As a matter of fact, without such an amendment, there
would have been no basis in the LGE or the RLGE for the CNEE to rely upon its
own VAD study to calculate EEGSA’s VAD for the 2008-2013 tariff period.”*!

The Claimant therefore argues that this amendment of the LGE and the way in which
it was interpreted by Guatemala was a fundamental departure from the regulatory
framework upon which Teco had relied when making its investment.”>?

Finally, contrary to the Respondent’s contention, its allegations regarding the 2007
amendment to Article 98 of the RLGE are not time-barred under the Treaty, because
according to Article 10.16(2)(b-c) of the Treaty, the investor is not required to
identify every measure about which it complains in its notice of intent. In any event,

the Claimant did indeed identify this amendment in its Request for Arbitration.”

ii. The LGE established that the VAD would be calculated on the basis of

the VNR of a distribution network of a model efficient company

that the rate of return should correspond to a rate of between 7 percent and 13

percent of the VNR.?*

. The VNR, which is the basis for calculating the distributor’s VAD, can therefore not

be reduced by depreciation, since the concept of new replacement value is
inconsistent with a depreciated value.?>>

The Claimant avers that Guatemala introduced the model company concept in the
LGE in order to increase EEGSA’s privatization value,” which explains why the
consortium paid US$520 million for EEGSA despite the valuation, made some years
before in the PW Report, of only US$13.9 million.”

Teco, having paid a value higher than the actual value for EEGSA’s assets, needed to
recover its investment base through higher electricity tariffs guaranteed by the
LGE.**

This expectation was frustrated by Resolution No. 05-2008, which amended the FRC
initially contained in the Terms of Reference and thereby cut by half the VNR of the
model company. According to Teco, the exchanges between the CNEE and its
consultant show that the unlawful calculation of the FRC was designed with the

specific purpose of significantly reducing EEGSA’s VAD.??

. According to Teco, this provision violated the LGE as it depreciated by half the

value of a fictitious company that should by law have been considered as new.

The Expert Commission confirmed that the FRC imposed by the CNEE in the Terms
of Reference was contrary to the express provisions of the LGE. The CNEE
misinterpreted the concept of the VNR as established in the law, and this had the
effect of halving the return that had been promised to EEGSA.”°°

Teco also argues that, because of other irregularities committed by the CNEE, the
latter imposed tariffs upon EEGSA based on a VAD that did not meet the expected

iii. Discrepancies between the distributor and the CNEE on the VAD study
would be resolved by an independent Expert Commission

. Article 75 of the LGE provides that, in case of discrepancies between the distributor

and the CNEE on the VAD study, an Expert Commission shall pronounce itself on
such discrepancies.

Furthermore, when promoting the privatization of EEGSA, Guatemala reported in
the Memorandum of Sale to potential investors that “in the event of discrepancy, a
Commission of three experts will be convened to resolve the differences.”?”

Indeed, the terms of reference for the 2003 tariff review provided that any

discrepancies would be “reconciled” by the Expert Commission.2~

. The CNEE also stated in November 2003, during judicial proceedings unrelated to

this arbitration, that “[i]n the event of discrepancies, pursuant to Article 98 [of the
RLGE] and [Article] 75 of the [LGE], an Expert Commission shall be constituted,
which shall resolve [the discrepancies] in a term of 60 days.”

In Teco’s submission, the Respondent’s argument that the Expert Commission’s
decisions were merely advisory and non-binding is disproved by Guatemala’s own
behavior. In fact, had it been so, Guatemala would not have attempted to interfere
with the appointment of the chairman of the Expert Commission and to influence Mr.
Jean Riubrugent.”° Respondent’s position that the CNEE had the power to
unilaterally calculate the WAD irrespective of the Expert Commission’s
determinations would also be inconsistent with its own argument that Article 98 bis,
which provided for the possibility that the Government could appoint the chairman
of the Expert Commission, was necessary in order to prevent indefinite delays in the
calculation of the VAD.

Guatemala’s arguments that the mission of the Expert Commission was limited to
noting the existence of discrepancies, or that the use of the verb “pronounce” in the
LGE implied that the Expert Commission could only express a non-binding opinion,
are opportunistic. Guatemala only adopted such positions once it found that the

decision of the Expert Commission implied an increase in EEGSA’s VAD.

7 and the

294. Both the specific meaning of the term “pronounce” in a legal context”®
logical meaning of said provision in the LGE as well as the other representations
made by Guatemala indicate that the Expert Commission had the authority to resolve
disputes between the distributor and the CNEE in a binding manner.

295. The representations made in this respect were relevant to the investor, as the powers
granted to the Expert Commission ensured a fair, depoliticized and efficient method
of resolving disputes between the CNEE and the distributor.2*

291

a

In breach of the many representations made by Guatemala and the CNEE, the CNEE
decided to ignore the Expert Commission’s report and to instead impose a VAD
based on a study prepared by its own consultant Sigla, which neither EEGSA nor its
consultant knew about and in preparation of which they had no input.2®
297. In Teco’s submission, it is only after having learnt of the Expert Commission’s
adverse rulings that the CNEE came up with the argument that the Expert
Commission’s role was limited to recording the differences between the CNEE and
the distributor. It did so in order to justify its decision to dissolve the Expert
Commission, disregard its report and impose a VAD based on the Sigla report.?”
298. The Claimant also alleges that, in its decisions of November 18, 2009 and February
24, 2010, the Guatemalan Constitutional Court misinterpreted the applicable
regulatory framework. According to Teco, those decisions are so devoid of reasons
and so contrary to the law that it can only be concluded that they were motivated by
political interest to prevent any increase in electricity rates, as shown in the statement
of the President of Guatemala and uncle of the CNEE’s chairman, Mr. Alvarez
Colom, in which he stated that reducing tariffs had been an achievement of his

administration.?”

b) Guatemala carried out the 2008 tariff review in bad faith and in an openly
arbitrary manner

299. Teco’s claim is also based on the fact that the Respondent conducted the tariff review

for the 2008-2013 period in an unjust and arbitrary manner, intending to manipulate

the process and control the outcome of the tariff review.

300. The Claimant’s arguments in this respect relate to: (i) the issuance of the Terms of

Reference which included illegal provisions; (ii) the unjustified rejection of the Bates
White study; (ii) the attempts to tamper with the functioning of the Expert
Commission; (iv) the unilateral dissolution of the Expert Commission before it had

completed its work; and (v) the harassment of EEGSA’s executives.
i. The issuance of the Terms of Reference for the 2008 review

The Claimant contends that the CNEE drafted the Terms of Reference for the 2008-
2013 period so as to require a reduction in the VAD while granting itself the right to
interfere in and even stop the studies if it disagreed with their content, all this being
contrary to the relevant provisions of the LGE and the RLGE.?”

Article 1.9 of the Terms of Reference was particularly controversial, as it gave the
CNEE discretion to deem the distributor’s study “not received” within the meaning
of the recently amended Article 98 of the RLGE if any section of the study was
lacking or even if, in its own judgment, this study did not conform to the Terms of
Reference or was incomplete. According to the Claimant, this provision would allow
the CNEE to position itself to ignore the distributor’s study and replace it with its

own study whenever it did not like the study presented by the distributor.”

303. Teco challenged these Terms of Reference and only withdrew its appeal after the

CNEE agreed to modify them and include two key provisions: Article 1.8, according
to which the distributor only needed to make the corrections to the study that it
deemed appropriate; and Article 1.10, stating that the Terms of Reference were only
guidelines subject to the LGE and its regulations and that the distributor could
deviate from the Terms of Reference if it considered that they contravened the

LGE.?

ii. The unjustified rejection of the Bates White study

304. The Claimant alleges that the CNEE, for trivial reasons, refused to accept several

30:

5.

 

stages of the Bates White study, thus hindering and delaying the normal procedure.
Guatemala used frivolous excuses for not accepting the Bates White stage reports,

such as the lack of signature from an EEGSA-authorized representative on the letter

accompanying the stage reports of the study or the lack of a deed appointing the
EEGSA consultant.?”*>

306. Finally, after putting up several obstacles to the admission of the stage reports and
having made several corrections to them, the CNEE decided that there were still
discrepancies in the May 5, 2008 version of the Bates White VAD study and called
for the formation of an Expert Commission, setting forth the discrepancies to be
resolved. However, when dealing with this in its Resolution No. 96-2008, the CNEE
distorted the presentation of the discrepancies to include aspects of the Bates White
study to which it had not previously objected and which Bates White could not
therefore have been able to either correct or answer.

iii. | Attempts to manipulate the functioning of the Expert Commission by the
CNEE

30)

a

. The Respondent attempted to manipulate the functioning of the Expert Commission
in various ways: through the adoption of Article 98 bis RLGE; by trying to establish
that it would be the CNEE that would ultimately verify whether the consultant
complied with the Expert Commission’s rulings; and by maintaining improper
contacts with the member of the Expert Commission appointed by the CNEE, Mr.

Jean Riubrugent.

e The adoption of Article 98 bis RLGE

305

*

After convening the Expert Commission, Guatemala added Article 98 bis to the
RLGE, allowing it to appoint the third member of the Expert Commission, in
contradiction with Article 75 LGE.

30

Ss

. According to the Claimant, although this provision was not enforced by the CNEE
because EEGSA would have challenged its retroactivity, its adoption demonstrates
the CNEE’s attempts to improperly, arbitrarily, and unfairly control the tariff review
process in violation of Teco’s legitimate expectation that the tariff review would be

performed in a fair and depoliticized manner.?”°

e The attempt to have the CNEE decide on the incorporation of the
rulings of the Expert Commi.

 

     

n_in the consultant’s study

During the negotiations to establish the Operating Rules of the Expert Commission,
the CNEE sought to reserve for itself the last word on whether the Bates White study
had implemented the Expert Commission’s rulings, thereby allowing it to manipulate
the outcome of the process.?””

An agreement was reached in this respect between EEGSA and the CNEE to include
Article 12 of the Operating Rules. According to Article 12, the Expert Commission
would be entrusted to review whether the VAD study had complied with the Expert
Commission’s decisions. The Operating Rules were communicated to the chairman

of the Expert Commission.”

e Improper « ications with the expert inted by the CNEE

 

The Claimant argues that, contrary to the provisions of the LGE, according to which
the experts should be impartial and independent, and contrary to the Operating Rules,
according to which any ex parte contact with the members of the Expert Commission
was prohibited, the CNEE remained in contact throughout the process with its expert,
who was instructed to take decisions that suited them.?”

In particular, Teco argues that the emails exchanged between the CNEE and Mr.
Riubrugent show that the CNEE had devised an unlawful FRC calculation with its
consultant for the specific purpose of reducing the VAD, and then provided its own
appointee expert, Mr. Riubrugent, with materials to support the CNEE’s position

within the Expert Commission.”*”

iv. The dissolution of the Expert Commission

Once the Expert Commission had issued its report and the CNEE had realized that
such report would imply an increase in the VAD, the CNEE dissolved the Expert
Commission without allowing it to review and approve the corrections made in the
Bates White study. The CNEE thus disregarded Article 12 of the Operating Rules to
which the parties had agreed. In addition, the CNEE threatened its expert, Mr.

Riubrugent, in order to dissuade him from participating in the review of the corrected

Bates White study.7*!

uw

Finally, the CNEE ignored the report of the Expert Commission, as well as the
statements of engineers Bastos and Giacchino according to which Bates White had
corrected its study in compliance with the report, and it instead imposed a VAD
based on a study prepared by its own consultant, Sigla, which neither EEGSA nor its
consultant knew about and in which they had had no input.?*

6. As a consequence, unreasonably low tariff rates were set for the 2008-2013 period.
Such tariffs were set arbitrarily, entirely at the discretion of the CNEE, in violation of

the provisions of the LGE and contrary to Teco’s legitimate expectations.***

_

The tariffs set by the CNEE were economically unviable for Teco, which was forced
to sell its shares in EEGSA for a price significantly lower than their value and at a

substantial loss.”**

v. Harassment of EEGSA executives

8. The Claimant alleges that, after having carried out the 2008 tariff review, the
Respondent took actions to harass EEGSA executives, ultimately forcing them to
leave Guatemala,”*>

9. In particular, on August 26, 2008, the Guatemalan Public Prosecutor’s Office
petitioned the Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants against two of EEGSA’s senior
managers, including Mr. Maté, on patently baseless charges. The warrants were
issued by the Court on August 29, 2008. Although a provisional recourse of amparo
suspending the arrest warrant was issued by the Criminal Court a few days later,
Mr. Maté, who was out of the country at the time, decided not to return to

Guatemala.”*°

320. Teco also notes that on September 1, 2008, while Mr. Calleja was on a radio program

discussing the CNEE’s unlawful actions and the severe economic consequences for

EEGSA, his car was broken into and his laptop stolen. After this incident, Mr.

Calleja also decided to leave Guatemala with his family.°*”

c) Guatemala’s actions violated its obligation to accord fair and equitable
treatment to Teco

32

. Teco states that Guatemala violated its obligation to accord its investment fair and
equitable treatment when it (i) substantially altered the regulatory framework,
frustrating the legitimate expectations of the Claimant, and (ii) acted arbitrarily,

illegally, and in bad faith during the 2008 tariff review process.

i. Substantial modification of the regulatory framework and frustration of
the legitimate expectations of the Claimant

322. The Claimant alleges that, just as in the case of actions of the Media Council in CME

v. Czech Republic, the actions of the CNEE cannot be considered as part of the

normal exercise of regulatory authority in compliance and enforcement of the law.

To the contrary, the CNEE substantially changed the regulatory framework that had

been established to attract investors and upon which Teco had relied to make its
investment.”**

32:

»

A breach by the State of specific representations made to foster investment is a
violation of the minimum standard of treatment.”*? Contrary to Guatemala’s
contention, and as established by all tribunals constituted under NAFTA or other
investment treaties having addressed the issue, the investor’s legitimate expectations
are protected.?””

324. Teco accepts that the protection of legitimate expectations does not refer to mere
subjective expectations and that expectations should be analyzed objectively,
checking whether the State made specific representations on which a reasonable

investor would have relied to make their investment.”*!

a

Such representations can be made through laws, regulations or policies declared by
the State. They can also emanate from prospectuses or offering circulars in the case
of a privatization even if such documents have not been prepared by the State when
they are issued on its behalf.”

As stated by the ICSID Secretary General, “/t/he weight of authority suggests that an
undertaking or promise need not be directed specifically to the investor and that
reliance on publicly announced representations or well-known market conditions is a
sufficient foundation for investor expectations.”

As a consequence, if the State fundamentally changes its regulations or policies,
whether through amendments to the existing regulation or by issuing a new and
different interpretation of the same, this would defeat the legitimate expectations of
the investor and would violate the obligation of fair and equitable treatment. The

Claimant argues, relying on the Total decision,”

that although the obligation of fair
and equitable treatment does not operate as a stability clause or prevent the State
from changing its laws, in the case of long-term investments, regulations should
provide a clear framework for future operations. The concept of regulatory fairness
or regulatory certainty applies, and the State cannot therefore change its regulatory
regime so as to prevent the investor from recouping its investment and making
reasonable profits.°°

The Claimant alleges that Guatemala failed to ensure a stable and predictable legal
and business environment; it disregarded the system of checks and balances
established under the LGE and the RLGE by ignoring the Expert Commission’s
Report and Bates White’s revised study, and it fundamentally altered the legal and

business environment under which Teco had invested in EEGSA.””°
ii. Prohibition of arbitrary, illegal, and grossly unfair actions

The Claimant contends that the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment, as it
has been understood in virtually all NAFTA arbitration decisions or under the Treaty,

prohibits conduct that is arbitrary, grossly irregular, unjust, or idiosyncratic and

behaviors that exhibit a complete lack of transparency and candor in an

S

Several tribunals have established that, although it is not necessary to prove bad faith
in order to establish a violation of the minimum standard of treatment, if it is proved
that the State acted in bad faith this establishes a violation of the standard.”

33

. Guatemala’s actions infringed “a sense of fairness, equity and reasonableness”, in
violation of the standard set forth by the NAFTA tribunal in Merrill v. Ring?* and
as such they “constitute an unexpected and shocking repudiation of [the LGE’s]
policy’s very purpose and goals or otherwise subvert a domestic law or policy for an

99299

ulterior motive.

33

N

. According to Teco, as in Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, Guatemala’s “failure to put in
place an independent, impartial regulator, insulated from political influence,
constitutes a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, in that it represents

a departure from [the investor’ s] legitimate expectation.”>”

2. Damages

33

»

Teco argues that the fact that the CNEE has fixed the VAD too low for the 2008-
2013 period has caused it considerable loss and, in particular, it claims compensation
for (a) lost cash flow that its investment would have earned had EEGSA been able to
collect the VAD to which it was entitled between August 1, 2008, the date the CNEE
imposed its tariffs, and October 21, 2010 when Teco sold its investment in EEGSA,
plus (b) the difference between the actual market value of Teco’s EEGSA shares in
October 2010 with the VAD approved by the CNEE and the amount that its shares
would have been worth had Guatemala not breached its Treaty obligations. In
addition, Teco is also claiming (c) pre- and post-award compounded interest at a rate
of 8.8 percent.*”!

unlawful act and re-establish the status quo that would have existed but for the

wrongful act.>?

a) Profits lost between August 2008 and October 2010

335. Regarding Teco’s lost profits between August 1, 2008 and October 21, 2010, the
Claimant asserts that they constitute the difference between the actual historical
results and the cash flow projection made by Mr. Kaczmarek if the Bates White
corrected final report had been applied.

336. Mr. Kaczmarek used EEGSA’s current and projected financial statements to
calculate the loss of free cash flow of the firm,** and estimated EEGSA’s cash flows
loss between August 1, 2008 and October 21, 2010 at US$87 million.* Asa
consequence, Teco’s loss, given its 24.3 percent stake in the company, was

US$21,100,552.°%

b) The loss in value of EEGSA’s shares as a result of Guatemala’s actions

337. To determine the loss in value of EEGSA’s shares, Mr. Kaczmarek calculated the
value of the company in the current scenario, i.e. with tariffs set according to the
values established in the Sigla study (“actual value”) and compared it with the value
that the company would have had if the tariffs had been fixed according to the
corrected Bates White final study (“but-for value”).°°”

338. Mr. Kaczmarek calculated both values by three different methods: the discounted
cash flow (“DCF”) method, the comparable publicly-traded companies method, and
the comparable transactions method. Then the expert assigned to each specific
valuation method a certain weighting, depending on the level of confidence that he
thought they deserved. Thus, he assigned a value of 60 percent to the DCF Approach,
30 percent to the comparable publicly-traded company approach, and 10 percent to

the comparable transaction approach.* 08

*°5 Report CER-5, p. 9, Table 3. Expert Kaczmarek concluded that cash flow in the “but-for” scenario was US$170 million,
from which the cash flow in the actual scenario of US$83 million should be subtracted to get the amount of flow lost: US$87
million.

Based on these calculations, the Claimant’s expert concluded that EEGSA’s actual
value was US$562.4 million and its but-for value US$1,479.3 million.”

Mr. Kaczmarek then subtracted US$87.6 million from EEGSA’s net debt as of
October 21, 2010 and concluded that the capital investment of the Claimant,
considering its percentage of 24.26 percent equity interest in the company, amounted
to US$115,198,529 and US$337,683,311 in the actual and “but-for” scenarios
respectively. Therefore, Teco’s loss as a result of the decrease in fair market value of

its shares in EEGSA is US$222,484,783.°"°

Teco submits that the arguments used by Respondent’s expert to criticize the

reference made by Mr. Kaczmarek to comparable aul

312

companies and the use of the
comparable transactions method are incorrect.
The sample employed by Kaczmarek in fact included twelve businesses and nine
transactions while, according to most leading practitioners, significant confidence
can be derived from a sample of four to seven companies.*!3

Moreover, Teco rejects Guatemala’s claim that the weighting of the various methods
was arbitrary and results-oriented,*"* and argues that the procedure to assign the
weights was based on objective criteria. Mr. Kaczmarek had legitimate reasons to
assign greater weight to businesses or operations that were the most similar to
EEGSA,*!>

Regarding the criticisms according to which the Claimant’s expert underestimated
the capital costs, the Claimant states that when calculating EEGSA’s value, its expert

6

properly projected EEGSA’s actual capital expenditures*! rather than those of a

model company, which is what the capital costs figures in the Bates White Study
represent.*!”
Teco also avers that Guatemala’s expert miscalculated the amount of capital

expenditures in the Bates White study by adding together the capital expenditures

and the return of the capital portion of the VAD. Said expert’s projections for
EEGSA’s capital expenditures are out of line with the capital costs of EEGSA itself
or the amount of capital expenditures for other comparable distribution companies. *!*
346. Moreover, the Claimant argues that Respondent’s expert did not calculate EEGSA’s
“but-for” valuation by using the Bates White study, but relied instead on Mr.
Damonte’s model, which does not incorporate all of the Expert Commission’s
rulings.*"? The Claimant argues that it makes no sense to calculate EEGSA’s value in
the “but-for” scenario by using a model that does not accept the Expert

fcotane age 3
Commission’s rulings. 20

 

34

Xn

. Regarding the value of Teco in the actual scenario, the Claimant agrees that the real
transaction price of the company that is being valued is the best evidence of that
company’s actual value; in this case, however, the sale was of DECA II and not only
of EEGSA, and the price paid by EPM did not specify the price paid for EEGSA,
thus the Claimant considered it more appropriate to conduct the valuation using other

traditional valuation methods.*”!

d) Reasonableness of the valuation of Claimant’s experts

348. According to the Claimant, the three following additional tests show that its expert’s

oe 2
valuation is reasonable.

i. The internal rate of return (“IRR”) for the cost of equity

349. In both scenarios, actual (0.6 percent) and “but-for” (7.7 percent), the IRR is below

the real cost of equity (11.01 percent).*”*

ii. The VNRs calculated by Bates White and Sigla

350. According to Mr. Kaczmarek, the valuation of EEGSA could be checked against
EEGSA’s VNR, which should approximate the fair market value of EEGSA. He
submits that the valuation of EEGSA in the “but-for” scenario was within 6 percent
of Bates White’s VNR value, and that the valuation of EEGSA in the actual scenario

Commission on the FRC, preferring to create his own formula. While the Expert Commission formula allowed EEGSA to get

was lower than Sigla’s VNR because Sigla used the CNEE’s FRC, which reduced

EEGSA’s return on capital.°74

iii. The selling price at which EPM bought DECA IT

351. Teco received US$181.5 million for its share of DECA II, and analyzing the value
allocated to each company of DECA II, EEGSA accounted for 62.2 percent, which,
according to the Claimant, results in an implied valuation for EEGSA of US$498

million.*°

e) Interest

352. Article 10.26(1) of the Treaty provides for an award of monetary damages and any
“applicable interest”. The Claimant therefore contends that it should be awarded both
pre-award and post-award compound interest at a rate of 8.8 percent up to the date of
effective discharge of the obligations.*”°

35

»

Respondent’s expert Dr. Abdala acknowledged at the hearing that this would be an
appropriate pre-award interest rate for the period between August 1, 2008 and
October 21, 2010, since it corresponds to EEGSA’s WACC at that time?’

35.

aa

Claimant argues that the same interest rate should be applied from the date of the sale
of EEGSA up to the date of the award because Teco sold its interest in EEGSA as a
result of Respondent’s actions during the 2008-2013 tariff review.

35.

on

. According to the Claimant, this same rate should also apply to post-award interest
because, as explained by its expert Mr. Kaczmarek, there is no reason to differentiate
between the rate applicable pre- and post- award.**

356. As the ILC Articles on State Responsibility also recognize, interest must run until the

date the obligation to pay is fulfilled,*”?

35

x

. Interest should be capitalized annually, for it is now widely recognized that “tribunal

practice has shifted towards awarding compound interest when requested by the

claimant.”**°

. The Claimant opposes the Defendant’s contention that a risk-free rate similar to that

applied to U.S. sovereign debt*"!

should be applied. As a matter of fact, this would
not be a commercially reasonable rate because it is not available to participants in the
commercial sector. According to Teco, the Respondent does not cite a single case in
which an arbitral tribunal has ordered capitalized interest to be paid at a risk-free
rate.*?

The Claimant also rejects Guatemala’s argument that interest accruing after the sale
of EEGSA should be set at a risk-free rate because, since that time, the Claimant was
no longer exposed to the risk of operating said company. According to Teco, that fact
is irrelevant because EEGSA was valued by discounting projected future cash flows

at the company’s cost of capital,

B. Respondent’s Position

360.

361.

According to the Respondent: (1) the dispute between the Parties in this arbitration
relates to a difference of opinion regarding the application of the regulatory
framework of the electricity sector in Guatemala, which is not covered by the
minimum standard of treatment under the Treaty. The Respondent, nevertheless,
answered the specific allegations made by the Claimant with respect to (2) the
alleged frustration of its legitimate expectations, and (3) the alleged injust and
arbitrary actions taken by the State in the tariff review process. Finally, (4)

Guatemala addressed Claimant’s claim for damages.

The minimum standard of treatment under the Treaty does not cover Teco’s

claims

The applicable standard is the minimum standard of treatment under international
law in accordance with Article 10.5 of the Treaty. Guatemala contends that the

Claimant therefore has the burden of proof of the “general and consistent practice of

States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation” in order to provide content to
the minimum standard of treatment, but it has not satisfied this burden.***

362. In order to constitute a breach of the international minimum standard of treatment,
the State’s conduct must be particularly egregious against the investor’s interests, as
various Arbitral Tribunals constituted under NAFTA or other treaties have
decided.**°

363. The international minimum standard of treatment accords an ample margin of
appreciation to the State, it is therefore not to be applied to disputes stemming from
supposed irregularities allegedly contrary to the domestic law, the determination of
which is reserved for the local courts.**° Although the decision of a regulatory body
may be subject to criticism or even be contrary to law from the perspective of the
relevant domestic legislation, it does not for that reason alone violate international
law. For this, the conduct must constitute a deliberate violation of the regulatory
authority’s obligations or an insufficiency of Government action falling far below
international standards.**”

364. The Respondent contends that the present case concerns discrepancies between the
investor and the regulator regarding the interpretation of the regulatory framework
and cannot be considered a case of direct and shocking repudiation of the applicable
tules. Therefore, the Claimant’s claims must be brought before the domestic
courts.***

36!

mn

Guatemala’s position is that a violation of domestic law does not breach the
international minimum standard of treatment unless it is a manifest and unjustified
repudiation of a right and the victim did not have access to domestic courts, that is,
justice has been denied.* However, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has
already brought its case before the local courts of Guatemala, that such courts were

available to hear its claims and have done so independently and impartially, as is

clear from the various favorable decisions obtained by the Claimant.*° In any case,
the Claimant has not alleged denial of justice in this arbitration. *4!

Finally, the doctrine of legitimate expectations does not apply in the context of the
international minimum standard of treatment, as the practice and opinio juris of State
Parties to the Treaty demonstrate.” Guatemala submits that the Claimant has yet to
provide a single example of a violation of the international minimum standard of
treatment in which the breach of legitimate expectations was found to be the basis of
the State’s responsibility.

Furthermore, the autonomous standard referred to by the Claimant, although not
applicable in this case, does not protect the mere ordinary expectations of an investor
that a public authority will not breach a contract or will not commit any irregularity

under the applicable regulatory framework.*4

2. The alleged representations made by Guatemala and the alleged frustration of

 

Teco’s legitimate expectations

The Respondent argues that, contrary to Claimant’s averment, the electricity
regulatory framework under which Teco made its investment continues to be in
effect because, although there have been some adjustments to the regulations, these
are normal and were expected and accepted by Teco in the Authorization
Agreements, which did not contain any stability clause.**°

Teco’s own attitude is inconsistent with its claims in the arbitration, as shown by the
declarations of its CEO who, three months before initiating arbitration, stated that
Guatemala was a market in which the rules were clear and there was certainty. 4°
Moreover, Guatemala rejects the idea that Teco could have created legitimate
expectations at the time that EEGSA was privatized, because at that time Teco had

yet to come into existence. Indeed, Teco was created in 2005 and it was only then

that it acquired the shares in EEGSA, so expectations could hardly have been created
based on the statements of Guatemala during the privatization process.* 47

37

. Although Teco has alleged that EEGSA’s shares always belonged to the same group
of companies and the expectations of the group were transferred to Teco, a simple
reference to being a member of a group is not enough to exclude an analysis of the
transfer of legitimate expectations. According to Guatemala, this would require
inquiring into and demonstrating what the expectations of each company of the
group were in relation to the investment in Guatemala.** The Claimant has not
proven that the company that acquired the EEGSA shares in 1998 had the same
executives as Teco.”

372. With regard to the regulatory framework and the tariff-setting process, Guatemala

responded to the Claimant’s allegations about (a) the amendment of Article 98 of the

RLGE in 2007, (b) the FRC in the 2008 Terms of Reference, and (c) the role of the

Expert Commission.

a) The amendment of Article 98 of RLGE in 2007

373. Guatemala contends that, contrary to the allegations of the Claimant, the 2007
amendment to Article 98 RLGE was not politically conceived to interfere with the
2008 tariff review, nor was it unconstitutional or in violation of the LGE.**°

374. The 2007 amendment originated in an amendment of Articles 98 and 99 of the
RLGE made in 2003, which had solved some problems concerning the tariff review
timeframe and sought to address the situation in which, for whatever reason, the
distributor did not have a tariff schedule in place after the expiration of the existing
tariff."

375. The 2007 amendment to Article 98 RLGE sought to correct the undesirable situation
that could arise if the distributor did not submit or correct its study, for in such cases
the RLGE would have rewarded the distributor with the continued application of the

existing tariffs, which could be beneficial for the defaulting distributor because in an

efficient business system, the distributor tends to reduce costs progressively, which

should result in a reduction of tariffs.*°?

376. In any case, at no point before this arbitration did EEGSA or its shareholders ever
object to the 2003 and 2007 RLGE reforms.**? In fact, given that the modification
took place in March 2007 and the Claimant only raised the argument in its October
2010 Request for Arbitration, such claim falls outside the three year time limitation

provided by Article 10.18.1 of CAFTA-DR and is therefore time-barred.*™*
b) The FRC in the 2008 Terms of Reference

377. According to the Respondent, the FRC was established by the CNEE in the Terms of
Reference for the 2008 review and EEGSA never disputed that provision,*> The
argument put forward by EEGSA’s consultant, Bates White, according to which they
raised no objection to the factor two in this formula but simply ignored it because it
was understood to be a mistake, cannot be admitted.>°

37

*

In addition, this formula was adopted in the Terms of Reference of all other
electricity distribution companies. Unlike EEGSA, other electricity distribution
companies - DEORSA and DEOCSA - discussed it with the CNEE and reached an
agreement to reduce the depreciation from 50 percent to 42.2 percent.* 7 According
to the Respondent, calculating the return on a gross capital base would be contrary to
the LGE, the basic principles of regulatory economics and the previous practice of
the CNEE. Literature published on the subject by Mr. Giacchino himself also

considered that to be the case.*** The Expert Commission shared that view.

c) The role of the Expert Commission

379. The LGE only provides that the Expert Commission should “pronounce itself” on the
discrepancies between the CNEE and the distributor’s consultant, and that it had a
period of sixty days in which to do so.

380. Guatemala contends, therefore, that (i) the “pronouncement” of the Expert

Commission was not binding, and that (ii) the role of the Expert Commission was

terminated when it pronounced itself on the discrepancies because there was no
provision for any post-ruling procedure. In any event, (iii) the Claimant reiterates
that those issues relate to the interpretation of the applicable domestic law and were

already decided upon by the competent court.
i. Non-binding Pronouncement

381. The pronouncements of the Expert Commission on the discrepancies between the
CNEE and the distributor’s consultant were not binding and should be interpreted as
a technical opinion for the benefit of the CNEE.**”

382. The Respondent points out that, under the LGE, the CNEE has the power and
responsibility to approve tariffs and enforce the LGE.*°

38

®

. According to Guatemala, this interpretation is derived from the fact that there is no
express provision establishing that the Expert Commission’s report should be
binding for the purposes of determining the VAD. On the contrary, the term
“pronounce itself,’ according to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy,
means to “declare” or “show oneself to be in favor or against something.”*"!

384. Moreover, under Guatemalan civil law, expert opinions are always advisory in

nature. Article 3 of the Law on Administrative Proceedings provides that a decision

by a technical body cannot be binding.*?

ii. Function limited to the pronouncement

38

on

. The Respondent contends that nowhere in the LGE or the RGLE is it provided that
the Expert Commission should perform any additional functions once it has made its
pronouncement. Nor is there any statement regarding this in the presentations made
by Guatemala prior to privatization, when the Official Commission was being
incorporated, or in the contract between the CNEE and members of the Expert
Commission. Therefore, once the Expert Commission has issued a pronouncement,
the task returns to the CNEE which, according to the LGE and the RLGE, is the

authority responsible for setting the distributors’ VAD and setting tariff schedules.

At no time is it stated that the Expert Commission could replace the CNEE in these

tasks.°°

iii. | These are aspects of domestic law that have already been decided by the
Constitutional Court of Guatemala

In any case, the Respondent asserts that both the role of the Expert Commission and

the scope of its pronouncements are matters of interpretation of Guatemalan law that

were decided by the Constitutional Court of Guatemala through fully reasoned

decisions and after a proper judicial process in which all the Claimant’s procedural

safeguards were respected.*™*

. Finally, the Respondent denies the allegations made by Teco that the Constitutional

Court’s decision were politically influenced. There is no evidence of any such
influence and the Constitutional Court has demonstrated its independence on

numerous occasions.*°

3. The alleged arbitrariness and injustice in the 2008 tariff review

. The Respondent contends that the Claimant uses the term “arbitrary” to reinforce its

claim without even elaborating on the concept of arbitrariness.*° Guatemala denies
having conducted the 2008 tariff review in an arbitrary and unfair manner, and
argues that the CNEE only fulfilled its role as laid down in the LGE to establish the
terms of the review and to verify the VAD studies presented by distributors.*”

The statements made by Teco’s executives, their purchaser (EPM) and other foreign
agents operating in the electricity market in Guatemala, as well as the actual figures
regarding foreign investment in the country, all confirm that the system is not

arbitrary and that there are proper legal safeguards in Guatemala.**

. In particular, the Respondent replied to the Claimant’s contentions regarding (a) the

Terms of Reference for the 2008 tariff review, (b) the Bates White study and use of
the Sigla study to calculate EEGSA’s VAD, (c) Article 98 bis of the RLGE, (d) the

between the CNEE and Mr. Riubrugent, and (f) the alleged harassment of EEGSA’s

executives.

The Terms of Reference for the 2008 tariff review

. Guatemala notes that the terms of reference applicable to the previous tariff review
for 2003-2008 granted the CNEE an equal or greater degree of control, and EEGSA
accepted that at the time without any objection, In particular, the provision in
Article 1.9 that “the CNEE may also consider the Study as not received if, in its own
judgment, the results requested in the ToR were not included, such that the Study
may be deemed to be incomplete, or to provide a partial or distorted portrayal’

already existed in the 2003-2008 tariff review terms of reference.*”!

The CNEE decided to make certain modifications in order to avoid the delays that

the amparo procedure would entail, but without sacrificing any of its powers.>” In

particular, the inclusion of Article 1.10 did not imply that the CNEE was delegating

its legal power to approve the distributor's VAD study,"

as can be seen by
comparing the wording proposed by EEGSA (“the consultant may vary, in a justified
manner, the methodologies [...] based on its knowledge and experience”) and the
wording finally adopted (“in the event of deviations in the methodologies set forth
[...] which must be fully justified, the CNEE shall make such observations regarding
the changes as it deems necessary, confirming that they are consistent with the

guidelines of the Study”).°™

The Bates White study and the use of the Sigla study by the CNEE to calculate

the VAD

. Guatemala contends that, by rejecting the stage reports of the Bates White study, by
making relevant comments to the consultant, and finally by stating their
discrepancies, the CNEE was only complying with its legal obligations as a
regulatory body.

. Bates White refused from the beginning of the review process to submit supporting

information and documentation that was necessary for the CNEE to perform an audit

of the study. In addition, its study reports were not traceable, that is to say the
interlinking between the data could not be verified*”>. In fact, this was one of the
discrepancies brought to the attention of the Expert Commission, in respect of which
it ruled in favor of the CNEE.*”°

395. The Respondent points out that the first VNR calculated by Bates White in 2008 was
up from US$744 million at the end of the previous period to US$1,695 million in the
first March 2008 Bates White study, representing an increase of 245 percent in the
required capital base, which is even more striking that Mr. Giacchino had
participated in both studies. According to Guatemala, these figures are even more
significant when compared with the predictions of Teco’s business model, in which
an increase in the 2008 VAD of between 2 percent and 3 percent in actual terms was
projected.*””

396. The VAD, initially estimated at US$552 million would also immediately change to
US$454 million in the corrected May 5, 2008 study, and US$252 million in the July
28, 2008 version, reflecting the lack of credibility of the Bates White study.>%

39

x

Furthermore, in a meeting requested by the President of Iberdrola in Latin America,
Mr. Gonzalo Pérez, the latter declared that the Bates White study was not useful and
proposed that the CNEE agree on a limited increase of the VAD over the previous
period, that is US$175 million?” This, according to Guatemala, shows that the
values contained in the tariff studies did not reflect the economic reality or an
efficient VNR.**°

398. The Bates White study did not comply with the LGE or with the Terms of Reference;
it was full of errors and inconsistencies and could not be audited. In fact, the Expert
Commission issued a pronouncement in favor of the CNEE in 56 percent of the
discrepancies submitted to it, including the exclusion of underground lines, issues of
traceability of the study, and non-use of comparable prices in the international

3
market.**!

399. Guatemala also affirms that the July 28, 2008 Bates White study did not incorporate
the totality of pronouncements issued by the Expert Commission, as confirmed
subsequently by a study of Mercados Energéticos.**

400. In view of the above, the Bates White study was not reliable and the CNEE exercised
its powers and responsibilities in accordance with the law when it rejected it and

decided to instead use the Sigla study to calculate the VAD.*
c) Article 98 bis of the RLGE

401. The Respondent asserts that the adoption of Article 98 bis of the RLGE in 2008 was
only intended to fill a lacuna in the RLGE if the CNEE and the distributor failed to
agree on the appointment of the chairman of the Expert Commission, in which case
the RLGE did not provide a solution.***

402. Nothing can be inferred from the fact that Article 98 bis provides that the chairman
of the Expert Commission should be appointed by the Government of Guatemala,
because the appointment had to be made from names included in a list provided by
both parties, and also because the LGE and the RLGE established the conditions that
all the members of the Expert Commission should fulfill. >°5

403. In any event, this provision was not applied in this case because the parties agreed to
appoint Mr. Bastos as chairman of the Expert Commission. As a consequence, it

3
cannot have caused damage to Teco.” 86

d) The Operating Rules

404. The Respondent denies that the parties reached an agreement on the Operating Rules
applicable to the Expert Commission, and in particular on the purportedly adopted
Rule 12, which provided that the Expert Commission would be responsible for
confirming whether the distributor’s study reflected its opinions.**”

40:

nm

Although these rules were discussed on several occasions and several drafts proposed

by each party were exchanged, the parties never reached a final agreement on the

Operating Rules, which were therefore never adopted.***

406. This is evidenced by the fact that, even in the purported final version of the
Operating Rules, the heading reads “Proposed Operating Rules.” Furthermore, as for
any decision taken by an administrative agency of the State, any agreement by the
CNEE regarding the Operating Rules had to be formalized in an official document.
As a matter of fact and as a matter of law, State bodies do not exercise their authority
through emails or simple letters but by way of official documents. It is also
noteworthy that there is no mention of the purportedly adopted Operating Rules in
the document establishing the Expert Commission or in the contracts signed between
the experts and the CNEE.**”

407. The only documents presented by the Claimant to prove its claim are emails — more
precisely internal EEGSA emails — as well as an email sent by Mr. Giacchino to the
chairman of the Expert Commission without copying the CNEE.*” Such evidence is

insufficient.

e) The alleged illicit contacts with Mr. Riubrugent

408. According to Guatemala, the exchanges of emails that took place in December and
January 2008 between Mr. Jean Riubrugent and the CNEE are innocuous and were

intended only to clarify technical issues,*”!

to exchange information and to make
clarifications*” in order for the latter to have a better understanding of the position of
the CNEE*”’.

409. Teco’s arguments in this respect are absurd because EEGSA appointed in the Expert
Commission Dr. Leonardo Giacchino, who was its own consultant and had himself

authored the Bates White study, which the Expert Commission had to analyze.**

f) The alleged harassment of EEGSA’s executives

410. The arguments relating to the alleged criminal prosecution of EEGSA’s executives

only seek to give a political flavor to the Claimant’s claim in order to raise it to the

international level.*”°

411. At the time when the arrest warrant was issued, the tariff schedules had already been
in force for almost a month. In addition, the Office of the Public Prosecutor is an
agency of the Public Ministry, a local decentralized entity that acted on its own, and
the CNEE executives had themselves been the object of similar complaints. In any
case, the arrest warrant was revoked two days after issuance by the Court of Appeals
in Guatemala City.°°

412. As to the theft of Mr. Calleja’s laptop, it is in Respondent’s submission unfounded
and frivolous, and was probably caused by the latter’s own negligence. In addition,
the Claimant did not present any evidence to prove the theft or the basis for its

3
accusations.*””

4. The damages

413. The Respondent contends that, even if the Arbitral Tribunal decides that it has
jurisdiction and Guatemala violated its obligations under the Treaty, it must in any
case conclude that Teco has not suffered any loss.°°8

414. The Respondent presents (1) the main errors in the valuation made by Mr.
Kaczmarek, to then (2) provide a corrected valuation of the alleged damage suffered
by Teco, and finally (3) criticize the parameters of reasonableness advanced by

experts Abdala and Schoeters.

a) The errors in Mr. Kaczmarek’s discounted cash flow valuation method
i. Operating costs projected by Mr. Kaczmarek

415. The Claimant’s arguments as to its operating costs are not credible. Teco’s expert
estimated that EEGSA should have a high income to meet the future costs of
operating and investment, but when he calculates the costs that EEGSA will actually
incur in the future, he assumes operating and investment costs that are significantly

lower, which results in an artificial increase in the company’s value. 9

ii. Mr. Kaczmarek’s projections in the “but-for” scenario

416. The projections made by Mr. Kaczmarek based on the July 28, 2008 Bates White
study in order to calculate the historical and future damages are incorrect because he
uses the result of the study without verifying whether its premises are reasonable or
whether it properly includes the pronouncements of the Expert Commission in their
entirety.*° The Barrera report is a preconceived analysis which was tailor-made to
support the Bates White study and contains no genuine analysis of the validity of
said study.*”!

417. The July 28, 2008 Bates White study does not accurately reflect all of the
pronouncements of the Expert Commission, as confirmed by the CNEE’s consultant

Mercados Energéticos, and by the expert Mr. Damonte,*”

403

who, by incorporating the

pronouncements” ~ of the Expert Commission, arrives at a VNR that is about 40

percent lower than that of the Bates White study.4*

418. Furthermore, the level of depreciation used by Kaczmarek is inadequate, as he
accepts the formula adopted by the Expert Commission without considering that the
Expert Commission could not change that formula without overstepping its powers.

419. In addition, the formula adopted by Kaczmarek contains serious conceptual and
implementation errors. The formula overcompensates the investor. As correctly
pointed out by Mr. Damonte:

“The formula proposed by the EC calculates the average of depreciation plus the
return on capital, starting, in each tariff revision, from capital without
depreciation and subtracting the accumulated depreciation each year for five
years. [...] Conceptually, this means that each tariff period will begin with
accumulated depreciation at zero, and it will be depreciated over five years only.
In the next period the cycle will repeat. My conclusion is that, by applying it
during various tariff periods, assets will be depreciating over five years and then

all the depreciation accrued over the five years is reincorporated in the assets in

 

4°2 Counter-Memorial, § 603; Exhibit R-103, Statement RWS-3.

4°3 Mr. Damonte states that to apply many of the pronouncements of the Expert Commission, additional information and
optimizations impossible to achieve in the time available are required, Report RER-2, § 176.

the next tariff period. This procedure is clearly wrong, as evidenced by the Net

Present Value Test.

1405

420. Mr. Damonte proposes using the “Constant Annuity” formula, which is commonly

used and in fact was used in the 2003-2008 review period. According to this formula,

Mr. Damonte gets a depreciation factor of 1.42 for the capital base, which means that

the network’s accumulated depreciation is 30 percent and the return would be

calculated on the remaining 70 percent.‘

 

Errors in the valuation resulting from comparables

421. The Respondent contends that the comparable valuation method used by Mr.

Kaczmarek is not relevant in this case, and the DCF method should be preferred for

the following reasons:

i.

iii.

The small sample size used (twelve public corporations and nine
transactions) makes them volatile and rather unreliable;“””

The companies and transactions selected have characteristics
different from those of EEGSA; as a consequence, the comparison
is far-fetched;*°*

The valuation is based on the EBITDA that was estimated by Mr.
Kaczmarek by using the DCF method, this method however suffers
from errors that make it inappropriate,” and

The ad hoc weighting used by Mr. Kaczmarek in averaging is
unjustified and biased. Mr. Kaczmarek assigns a greater weight to
companies or transactions with higher multiples, thereby artificially

producing a higher valuation for EEGSA.*"°

c) The sale of DECA II reflects the correct value for EEGSA in the actual
scenario

422. Guatemala contends that the best reference for establishing EEGSA’s value in the

actual scenario is the price paid by EPM to acquire the DECA II block of shares;

such price in fact reflects the agreement between independent parties under free
market conditions, and it is free from the possible errors that are inherent in the DCF
method and from the lack of companies that could be properly compared to
EEGSA.*"!

423. Both Teco and Iberdrola have maintained that EPM’s offer was a “global value,” and
that it was impossible to identify the price paid for EEGSA in the DECA II
transaction,“

424. However, during the arbitration proceedings, Guatemala obtained a document
prepared by Citibank, EEGSA’s advisor in the sale of its shares, which shows a value
of US$582 million. Thus, the Respondent contends that this value, which was
provided by Teco itself, should be used.*!4

425. In any case, in its reliance to the DCF method to assess EEGSA’s sale price, Mr.
Kaczmarek underestimated EEGSA’s value by relying on an EBITDA for 2009
instead of more current information available at the time of the DECA II sale, that
could have more precisely reflected the reality of EEGSA’s business. The experts
Abdala and Schoeters, who used that latter information, calculated the value as
US$518 million,*> which is the value that ought to have been attributed to EEGSA

in the alternative.“"°

d) Corrected valuation

426. Once its experts corrected the existing errors in the valuation submitted by the
Claimant, the losses alleged by Teco are reduced to zero if the value of EEGSA
provided by Citibank is used, or to US$8.1 million if using a value inferred from the
sale in the actual scenario.*!”

427. The Respondent also argues that the damage is zero if the Arbitral Tribunal considers
that the FRC should include a 50 percent depreciation. In this respect, Teco never
sought or justified a modification of the FRC, as DEORSA and DEOCSA did.*'

e) Reasonableness of Messrs. Abdala and Schoeters’ valuation

The valuation of EESGA’s VAD proposed by Messrs. Abdala and Schoeters is
reasonable. As a matter of fact, the historical evolution of the VAD as well as the
analysis performed by Messrs. Abdala and Schoeters are in line with the VAD of
Compaiiia de Alumbrado Eléctrico de El Salvador (“CAESS”) (the main distributor
of electricity in El Salvador).

Moreover, Messrs. Abdala and Schoeters have suggested as an additional verification
that the proposed VNR be compared to the Accounting Asset Base (or RAB),
estimated at US$483 million, which is very similar to Mr. Damonte’s corrected VNR
(net of depreciation), which was estimated at US$466.8 million.”

The experts proposed by Guatemala present an additional proof of reasonableness by
calculating the IRR prospectively at the time of the second tariff review (2008). This
method, using the corrected model, results in a value of 7.3 percent, in line with the
regulatory requirement of 7 percent.*”! The IRR calculation proposed by Mr.

Kaczmarek to support the Bates White study is completely incorrect*”?

because: (i) it
refers to an IRR of the shareholder, which the regulatory framework simply does not
contemplate, (ii) it includes activities that are not covered under the regulatory
framework, which are thus unrelated to the alleged measures, (iii) it calculates the
IRR from 1998, thus covering a period that is not related to the 2008 tariff review,
and (iv) it takes into account the price offered in the tender, when nothing in the

regulatory framework permits this.

f) Interest

The Respondent argues that in order to update the historical losses claimed to their
currency value as of October 21, 2010, it is necessary to actualize the presumed
damages calculated by the cash flow method from the date the damages occurred
until the aforementioned date, and in order to do so, it is necessary to apply an
actualization factor based on EEGSA’s cost of capital, which is best represented by

the WACC.*3

433. According to Guatelama, it would be appropriate to use, post October 21, 2010, an
actualization factor based on a risk-free rate, such as US 10-year government bonds
(2.8 percent during the period of October 2010-December 2011)". As a matter of
fact, such a risk-free rate would reflect the fact that, starting from the moment when
Teco relinquished its participation in EEGSA, it was no longer exposed to the risk of

operating that company. *?°

VII. THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
A. Claimant’s requests for relief

434. In its July 8, 2013 Post-Hearing Reply, the Claimant requested that the Arbitral
Tribunal issue an Award:

1. Finding that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae over the Claimant’s
claim arising under Article 10.5 of DR-CAFTA;

2. Finding that Respondent has breached its obligation under Article 10.5 of the
DR-CAFTA to accord Claimant’s investment in EEGSA fair and equitable
treatment;

3. Ordering Respondent to pay compensation to Claimant in the amount of
US$243.6 million;

4. Ordering the Respondent to pay interest on the above amount at 8.8 percent,
compounded from 1 August 2008 until full payment has been made; and

5. Ordering Respondent to pay Claimant’s legal fees and costs incurred in these

proceedings.
B. Respondent’s requests for relief

435. In its July 8, 2013 Post-Hearing Reply, the Respondent requested that the Arbitral
Tribunal:
1. Declare that it does not have jurisdiction over the claim filed by TGH;
2. Alternatively and subsidiarily, to reject each and every one of the claims made

by TGH on their merits; and, in addition to either case;

3. Grant any other compensation to Guatemala that the Tribunal deems

4. Order that TGH pay all costs of these arbitration proceedings, including the
fees and costs of the Tribunal and ICSID as well as all fees and costs incurred
by Guatemala for its legal representation in this arbitration, with interest prior

and subsequent to the award being issued until the date of actual payment.

VIII. REASONING OF THE AWARD

436. The Arbitral Tribunal will first deal with the Parties’ positions on jurisdiction (A),

and then with the merits (B).
A. Jurisdiction

437. As an initial matter, it is not in dispute that Guatemala, under the reservations that
will be discussed hereafter, has consented to arbitrate claims arising from an
investment under CAFTA-DR.

438. It is also not in dispute that Claimant’s 30 percent shareholding in EEGSA qualifies
as an investment pursuant to Article 10.28 of CAFTA-DR. Article 10.28 (b) of
CAFTA-DR qualifies as an investment any asset that an investor owns or control,
including shares in an enterprise.

439. It is equally not in dispute that Claimant’s 30 percent shareholding in EEGSA
qualifies as an investment under Article 25.1 of the ICSID Convention.

440. Finally, it is not in dispute that the Claimant qualifies as an investor pursuant to
CAFTA-DR.

44

. Respondent’s jurisdictional objections are (2) that the Claimant raises a mere
regulatory disagreement as to the interpretation of the laws of Guatemala, which
cannot give raise to claims under CAFTA-DR, (3) that such disagreement was
resolved by the Guatemalan courts and that the Claimant waived its right to raise a
claim for denial of justice, and (4) that the Arbitral Tribunal should give deference to
the jurisdictional decision made by the Iberdrola arbitral tribunal in favor of
Guatemala.

442. The Arbitral Tribunal will address each of these objections, after having defined the

content of the minimum standard of treatment under CAFTA-DR (1).

93

1. Minimum standard of treatment under CAFTA-DR

443. The minimum standard applicable to this case is defined as follows in Article 10.5,
paragraph 2, of the CAFTA-DR: “For greater certainty, paragraph I prescribes the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the
minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments. The concepts
of ‘fair and equitable treatment’ and ‘full protection and security’ do not require
treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do
not create additional substantive rights. The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide:
(a) ‘fair and equitable treatment’ includes the obligation not to deny justice in
criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the
principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and
(b) ‘full protection and security’ requires each Party to provide the level of police
protection required under customary international law.”

444. In order to assess whether it has jurisdiction to decide the present dispute, the
Arbitral Tribunal must determine whether the facts alleged by the Claimant are
capable, if proven, of constituting breaches of the Respondent’s international
obligations under CAFTA-DR.

445. As found by many arbitral tribunals, in performing this task, the Arbitral Tribunal
applies a prima facie test.‘

446. Claimant essentially avers that Guatemala failed to accord its investment treatment in
accordance with customary international law, in particular fair and equitable
treatment (“FET”).

447. In order for the Arbitral Tribunal to assess whether the Claimant has made a prima
facie case of breach by Guatemala of its obligation to grant FET, it is necessary, as a
threshold matter, to define the applicable standard under Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-
DR.

448. In this respect, Article 10.5(2) provides that FET under CAFTA-DR does not require
treatment in addition to or beyond what is required by the minimum standard of
treatment applicable under customary international law. Article 10.5 also provides

that the minimum standard “includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal,

. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the many arbitral tribunals

civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of
due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world.”

Guatemala avers that, under the minimum standard, the State conduct must be
“extreme and outrageous” in order to constitute a breach of Article 10.5.
Guatemala relies, in this respect, on several awards made under the North America

Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”).8

. Guatemala further submits that, unless the State conduct constitutes “‘a deliberate

violation of the regulatory authority’s duties and obligations or an insufficiency of

action falling far below international standards”?

, any dispute as to the State’s
regulatory conduct should be submitted to the local courts, and “only if the local
court has committed a denial of justice may a claim of unfair and inequitable

treatment be submitted to an international tribunal.”**°

. According to the Claimant, the minimum standard of FET prohibits conduct that is

arbitrary, grossly irregular, unjust or idiosyncratic, and behaviors that exhibit a
complete lack of transparency and candor in an administrative proceeding.**!

The Claimant also considers that although it is not necessary to prove bad faith in
order to establish a violation of the minimum standard, such a violation is established
if the State acted in bad faith.”

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the minimum standard of FET under Article
10.5 of CAFTA-DR is infringed by conduct attributed to the State and harmful to the
investor if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory
or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial
propriety.

456. The Arbitral Tribunal also considers that the minimum standard is part and parcel of
the international principle of good faith*, There is no doubt in the eyes of the
Arbitral Tribunal that the principle of good faith is part of customary international
law*”° as established by Article 38.1(b) of the Statute of the International Court of
Justice, and that a lack of good faith on the part of the State or of one of its organs
should be taken into account in order to assess whether the minimum standard was
breached.

45

x

. Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that, pursuant to Article 10.5 of CEFTA-DR,
a lack of due process in the context of administrative proceedings such as the tariff
review process constitutes a breach of the minimum standard. In assessing whether
there has been such a breach of due process, it is relevant that the Guatemalan
administration entirely failed to provide reasons for its decisions or disregarded its
own rules.

458. Based on such principles, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that a willful disregard of
the fundamental principles upon which the regulatory framework is based, a
complete lack of candor or good faith on the part of the regulator in its dealings with
the investor, as well as a total lack of reasoning, would constitute a breach of the
minimum standard.*”

459. In the case at hand, the Claimant alleges that Guatemala’s actions infringed “a sense

9438

of fairness, equity and reasonableness”*””, and “constitutes an unexpected and

shocking repudiation of {the LGE’s] policy’s very purpose and goals or otherwise

subverts a domestic law or policy for an ulterior motive.”*?

Essentially, the Claimant alleges that, by failing to abide by the conclusions of the

Expert Commission and by unilaterally imposing a tariff based on its own

consultant’s study, Guatemala repudiated the fundamental principles upon which the

regulatory framework was based and upon which it relied when making the
investment.“

461. The Claimant also alleges that the CNEE failed to act in good faith in the process of
establishing the tariff for 2008-2013, and acted in manifest breach of the law in
disbanding the Expert Commission in July 2008.4!

462. Such allegations are supported by evidence that the Arbitral Tribunal will have to

assess.

. According to the Claimant, such behavior does not only constitute a breach of the
regulatory framework established by Guatemala, but also a breach of Respondent’s
international obligations under CAFTA-DR.“?

464. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the Claimant has made allegations that are such,

if proved, as to establish a breach of Guatemala’s obligations under the minimum

standard, as defined in previous sections of this award.

46:

an

. There is in fact no doubt in the eyes of the Arbitral Tribunal that, if the Claimant
proves that Guatemala acted arbitrarily and in complete and willful disregard of the
applicable regulatory framework, or showed a complete lack of candor or good faith
in the regulatory process, such behavior would constitute a breach of the minimum

standard.

2. The alleged mere regulatory nature of the dispute

466. The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees with Guatemala’s argument that Teco’s claim, in
spite of its “labeling” as a breach of international law, would be no more than a
domestic dispute on the interpretation of Guatemalan law, which does not fall within
the jurisdiction of an international tribunal.“

As said above, this dispute is about whether the Respondent breached its obligations
under the minimum standard of treatment. It is an international dispute in which the

Arbitral Tribunal will be called to apply international law.

international law, the Arbitral Tribunal will have to decide certain points of
interpretation of the regulatory framework by applying Guatemalan law, does not
and cannot deprive the Arbitral Tribunal of its jurisdiction.

Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention is very clear in that international tribunals can
and must apply the laws of the host State to the questions in dispute that are
submitted to such law.

However, in spite of the fact that this Arbitral Tribunal will have to apply
Guatemalan law to some of the questions in dispute, the fundamental question that
this Arbitral Tribunal ultimately has to decide is, on the evidence, whether the
Respondent’s behavior is such as to constitute a breach of the minimum standard of

treatment under international law.

3. The Parties’ disagreement was allegedly resolved by the Guatemalan courts
and the Claimant waived its right to raise a claim for denial of justice

. The Arbitral Tribunal also disagrees with the conclusions drawn by Guatemala from

the absence of a denial of justice claim.

The fact that the Claimant did not make the argument that there was a denial of
justice in Guatemalan judicial proceedings cannot deprive the Arbitral Tribunal of its
jurisdiction to assess whether the Respondent’s conduct was in breach of its
international obligations.

The Claimant’s case is in fact not based on denial of justice before the Guatemalan
courts, but primarily on the arbitrary conduct of the CNEE in establishing the tariff,
as well as on an alleged lack of due process in the tariff review process.

It is indeed true that the Guatemalan courts have decided some of the questions in
dispute concerning the interpretation of the Guatemalan regulatory framework and
the regularity of some of the CNEE’s decisions under such law. It is also true that
this Arbitral Tribunal will have to apply Guatemalan law to some of the regulatory
aspects of the dispute, and that, in so doing, it may have to defer to the decisions
made by the Guatemalan courts when such aspects of the dispute are subject to
Guatemalan law.

However, the Arbitral Tribunal’s task is fundamentally to assess the legal relevance
of the facts under customary international law. As a consequence, although the

decisions made by the Constitutional Court of Guatemala will have consequences on

98

the findings that the Arbitral Tribunal will have to make under Guatemalan law, such
circumstance cannot deprive the Arbitral Tribunal of its jurisdiction to decide the
case under international law. In addition, as will be discussed further, the parties in
the Guatemalan court proceedings were in any event different.
476. The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees with Guatemala that the Claimant asks it “fo act as
an appellate court of third or fourth instance in matters governed by Guatemalan
wd

law.

AT

x

This Tribunal’s task is not and cannot be to review the findings made by the courts of
Guatemala under Guatemalan law. The Arbitral Tribunal’s task is rather to apply
international law to the facts in dispute, including the content of Guatemalan law as
interpreted by the Constitutional Court.

478. The Arbitral Tribunal also disagrees that “Guatemala cannot be held responsible
under the treaty and international law solely on the basis of whether an entity such
as the CNEE has acted rightly or wrongly in the exercise of its functions.”*°

479. It is in fact undisputed (for Guatemala did not make an argument to the contrary) that
the CNEE is a State organ and that its actions are attributable to Guatemala in
international law. The conduct of a state organ such as the CNEE is indeed
attributable to the State. Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility
provides to that effect that: “The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an
act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative,
executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the
organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central
Government or of a territorial unit of the State”, and that “an organ includes any
person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the
State.“

48

S

Tf the behavior of the CNEE is found to have been grossly unfair or idiosyncratic, or
if the CNEE is found to have acted in bad faith or with a complete lack of candor in
the regulatory process, such a behavior would constitute a breach of the minimum

standard in international law.

481. In particular, would the Arbitral Tribunal find — as the Claimant avers - that the
CNEE willfully disregarded the fundamental principles of the regulatory framework
in force at the time of the tariff review process in dispute, such a disregard would
amount to a breach of international law.

482. The Arbitral Tribunal also disagrees with Guatemala’s contention that, in case of
disagreement on the actions or decisions taken by the regulator “the State cannot be
held responsible [...] since another branch of the Government, the judiciary, has

99447

been called to intervene and has issued a decision on the matter.

48

»

As a matter of fact, as said above, the disputes resolved by the Guatemalan judiciary
are not the same as the one which this Arbitral Tribunal now has to decide. The
Arbitral Tribunal may of course give deference to what was decided as a matter of
Guatemalan law by the Guatemalan Constitutional Court. However, such decisions
made under Guatemalan law cannot be determinative of this Arbitral Tribunal’s
assessment of the application of international law to the facts of the case.

484. In addition, as said above, the loss allegedly suffered by the Claimant derives
primarily from the actions taken by the CNEE, rather than from the decisions made
by the Guatemalan judiciary. As a consequence, there is no need for the Claimant to
establish a denial of justice in order to find the State in breach of its international

obligations as a consequence of the actions taken by the CNEE.
4. The Iberdrola tribunal made a jurisdictional finding in favor of Guatemala

485. The Respondent has in several occasions relied on the award made on 17 August
2012 by the Iberdrola arbitral tribunal. The Respondent did not however submit that
the Iberdrola decision would have res judicata effects in the present case, or that it
would be binding or have the value of a precedent. Guatemala has nonetheless
underlined that the Iberdrola case is identical to the present one as to the facts, and
that the Iberdrola tribunal had to apply an autonomous standard of treatment which is
more demanding for the States than the minimum standard applicable to the present

case.

“7 Counter-Memorial, § 113.
8 Respondent PHB, §§ 75-76; Iberdrola Award, supra footnote 214.

100

486. The Arbitral Tribunal has made it clear, in the course of this arbitration, that it
would not rely on evidence presented in the Iberdrola arbitration.” Although the
factual matrix in both cases is similar, the applicable treaties and the parties are

different. In addition, the legal arguments and the evidence have been presented

differently.

487. The Arbitral Tribunal’s task is to resolve the present dispute on the basis of the legal
arguments and the evidence presented before it. As a consequence, the Arbitral
Tribunal, in making its findings on jurisdiction, cannot and will not rely on the
findings of the Iberdrola tribunal.

488. Based on the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction to decide
the dispute.

B. Merits

489. The present dispute essentially rests on an allegation of abuse of power by the
regulator and disregard of the regulatory framework in the context of an
administrative tariff review process.

490. The Arbitral Tribunal, in deciding this dispute, is mindful of the deference that
international tribunals should pay to a sovereign State’s regulatory powers.

49

. As the Methanex tribunal stated: “as a matter of general international law, a non-
discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with
due process and, which affects, inter alias, a foreign investor or investment, is not
deemed expropriatory and compensable unless specific commitments had been given
by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating
investment that the government would refrain from such regulation.”*° The Arbitral
Tribunal agrees.

492. However, the deference to the State’s regulatory powers cannot amount to condoning
behaviors that are manifestly arbitrary, idiosyncratic, or that show a complete lack of
candor in the conduction of the regulatory process.

493. As a consequence, although the role of an international tribunal is not to second-
guess or to review decisions that have been made genuinely and in good faith by a
sovereign in the normal exercise of its powers, it is up to an international arbitral

tribunal to sanction decisions that amount to an abuse of power, are arbitrary, or are
taken in manifest disregard of the applicable legal rules and in breach of due process
in regulatory matters.

In order to support their respective positions, the Parties have made opposed
submissions as to the content of the regulatory framework. The Arbitral Tribunal will
thus first (1) address the Parties’ disagreements as to the interpretation of the LGE

and the RLGE.

. The Arbitral Tribunal will then (2) address the Parties’ arguments as to the alleged

representations made by the Respondent to the Claimant, and Claimant’s alleged
legitimate expectations deriving from such representations.

The Arbitral Tribunal will then (3) deal with the Parties’ arguments relating to the
Respondent’s behavior, and (4) decide whether such behavior constitutes a breach of

Respondent’s international obligations.
1. The Parties’ disagreements as to the regulatory framework

The Claimant’s case is based in large part on the assertion that the CNEE willfully
and without reasons disregarded the regulatory framework applicable to the setting of
electricity tariffs in Guatemala, as established by the LGE and the RLGE.

The Parties are however in disagreement not only on the interpretation of certain
specific provisions of the LGE and the RLGE, but also on the fundamental principles
upon which the regulatory framework is premised as far as the tariff review process
is concerned.

It is therefore necessary, before entering into any analysis of Claimant’s assertions
that the CNEE disregarded the regulatory framework, to address these
disagreements.

In dealing with these matters, the Arbitral Tribunal will apply Guatemalan law, in

light of the relevant findings of the Guatemala Constitutional Court.*!

. The regulatory framework establishes two sets of rules regarding the establishment

of electricity tariffs. The first relates to the method of calculation of the tariff, while
the second — which the Tribunal considers of greater relevance for the solution of this

dispute — applies to the regulatory process leading to the establishment of the tariff.

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that, as far as the regulatory process leading to the
establishment of the tariffs is concerned, the regulatory framework rests on two clear
fundamental principles.

The first is that (b), save in the limited exceptions set by the regulatory framework,
the tariff would be established based on a VAD study made by a consultant
commissioned by the distributor.

The second is that (c), in case of disagreement between the distributor and the CNEE
on such study, a neutral Expert Commission would be called to pronounce itself.

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that both principles are the cornerstone of the
regulatory framework as far as the tariff review process is concerned.

By providing that the tariff would be established based on a VAD study realized by
the distributor’s consultant, the regulatory framework guarantees that the distributor
would have an active role in determining the VAD and prevents the regulator from

determining it alone and discretionally, save in limited circumstances.

. By providing that the regulator would have to make reasoned observations on the

distributor’s VAD study, the regulatory framework also ensured that setting the tariff
would be a bilateral and cooperative process.

Finally, by providing that an Expert Commission would pronounce itself on any
disagreement between the regulator and the distributor concerning the VAD, the
regulatory framework intended to ensure the neutrality and objectivity of the tariff
review process.

The Arbitral Tribunal will examine these principles in more detail in following
sections of this award.

The Arbitral Tribunal will then deal with the Parties’ disagreement on the effects of
the Terms of Reference and whether Bates Whites and the Expert Commission were
allowed to depart from the same (d).

As a preliminary matter, the Arbitral Tribunal will discuss the extent to which it
needs to give deference to the decisions made by the Constitutional Court on matters

of interpretation of the LGE and the RLGE (a).

a) Relevance in this arbitration of the Constitutional Court’s decisions

512. As explained in previous sections of this award*™, further to several sets of judicial
proceedings initiated by EEGSA, the Constitutional Court of Guatemala rendered
two decisions.

Sl

»

The first is dated November 18, 2009 and essentially decides that, because the Expert

Commission’s report is not binding upon the CNEE and because the regulator has the

exclusive power to set the tariffs, the CNEE was entitled to fix the tariffs on the basis

of its own independent study.

514. The second is dated February 24, 2010 and essentially decides that the CNEE was
entitled to disband the Expert Commission on July 28, 2008.

51

uw

Guatemala has submitted on several occasions that these decisions have disposed of

the dispute submitted to this Arbitral Tribunal.**3

The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees.

516. As a matter of fact, the decisions of the Constitutional Court cannot have the effect
of a precedent or have any res judicata effect in this arbitration. Nor can they
obviously have disposed of the present dispute.

Sl

_

Not only are the parties different (EEGSA and the CNEE before the national court
and Teco and Guatemala in this arbitration), but this Tribunal has to resolve an
entirely different dispute on the basis of different legal rules. The Arbitral Tribunal
has to assess whether the regulator’s conduct materializes a breach of the State’s
obligations under the customary international law minimum standard.

518. As a consequence, this Arbitral Tribunal is not bound by the Constitutional Court’s

decisions.

519. The findings of the Constitutional Court may nevertheless be relevant to the solution
of the present international law dispute. However, this is only so insofar as the
Constitutional Court interpreted aspects of the regulatory framework that are
submitted to Guatemalan law and which the Arbitral Tribunal finds of relevance in

order to assess whether the State’s international obligations were breached.

b) Establishment of the tariff based on the distributor’s consultant study

520. It is undisputed that the electricity tariffs, under Article 71 of the LGE, are based on

“the sum of the weighted price of all the distributor purchases referenced to the inlet

to the distribution network and the Valued Added Distribution” (Valor Agregado de
Distribucién - VAD).**4 The VAD is therefore one of the factors that is used by the
CNEE in fixing the tariffs.

. It is also undisputed that, pursuant to Article 71 of the LGE, the VAD is “the average

cost of capital and operation of a distribution network of a benchmark efficient
company operating in a given density area.”*5

Pursuant to Article 74 of the LGE, “each distributor shall calculate the VAD
components through a study entrusted to an engineering firm prequalified by the
Commission. The Commission may decide that several distributors commission only
one study if the distribution densities are similar in each group and use only one
VAD to determine the rates of all qualified companies in the same group.”

Article 97, second paragraph of the RLGE, provides that the CNEE establishes a list
of pre-qualified consultants amongst which the distributor elects the one entrusted to
realize its VAD study. Article 97 of the RLGE, third paragraph, provides for the
obligation for each distributor to contract one of the pre-qualified consultants to
establish its VAD study.

Article 98 of the RLGE sets limited circumstances in which the regulator may
disregard the distributor’s study and establish the VAD based on its own unilateral
study.

Article 98 provides to that effect that “in case of the distributor's failure to deliver
the studies or the corrections to same, the Commission shall be empowered to issue
and publish the corresponding tariff schedule, based on the tariff study the
Commission performs independently or performing the corrections to the studies
begun by the distributor.*"

Article 98 therefore clearly establishes that the CNEE could calculate the VAD on
the basis of its own independent study in two limited occurrences: (i) in case of a
failure by the distributor to deliver its own study, or (ii) in case of a failure by the
distributor to correct its study according to the LGE and the RLGE.

The LGE therefore clearly establishes the principle that the VAD component of the

tariff would be established on the basis of a study realized by a consultant pre-

“S! LGE art. 71, English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-17).

5 Thid.

105

qualified by the CNEE and chosen by the distributor. Once the VAD is so
established, the CNEE can calculate and fix the tariffs.
52!

*

Respondent contends in this respect that “the approved law contains no obligation to

ensure that the VAD approved is the one determined by the distributor’s study.”*8
The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees.

529. First, it would not make any sense for the regulatory framework to establish a
process whereby the distributor is requested to submit a VAD study, the regulator is
requested to comment on the same, and a neutral Expert Commission is called to
make a pronouncement in case of disagreement, if the regulator had the discretion to
disregard the distributor’s study.

530. Second, Article 98 RLGE is very clear in that the regulator may only disregard the
distributor’s VAD study and apply its own unilateral VAD study in limited
circumstances. As a consequence, if such circumstances are not met, the regulator
has the obligation to set the VAD on the basis of the distributor’s study.

53

. This is of course not to say that the distributor’s study is binding upon the regulator.
The regulator may disagree on certain parts of the study, in which case the Expert
Commission would make a pronouncement which, although not in itself binding, the
regulator would in good faith have to consider with care. What Article 98 excludes,
however, is the regulator’s discretion to reject without reasons the distributor’s study
and — as the case may be — the Expert Commission’s pronouncements.

532. Such principles were obviously of great relevance to any electricity distributor in

Guatemala.

53)

»

It is relevant in this respect that these principles were considered, in the 1993 study
contracted by USAID from the consultants Juan Sebastian Bernstein and Jean
Jacques Descazeaux for the benefit of the government of Guatemala at the time of
the privatization of the country’s electricity sector, as an important element of the
depolitization of the tariff review process: “The problem of the likely mal-functioning
of a regulatory organism in electricity has been forcefully put forward in Guatemala.
This perception is shared by the political, social and economic sectors consulted in

ant's ind.

the country. In the c s this reinforces the need of having objective

rules which define the s' obligations and rights, thus preventing the arbitra

 

intervention of regulatory entities. It is thought that it would be possible to minimize

the intervention of a regulatory organism in those matters most sensitive to
regulation, such as price regulation in the segments with characteristics of a natural
monopoly: transmission and distribution. In this case, a specific intervention might
be considered, for example, every 5 or 10 years, by a high level ad-hoc Government

entity, for example, a Committee formed by the Ministers of Finance and of Energy

 

holders from_a prestigious consulting agency. The permanent regulatory function

would be limited to overseeing compliance with the law in matters such as safety of

facilities (a function that might be assigned to the Ministry of Energy and Mines, for
example), even if the arbitration of conflicting aspects might be given to arbitrating
courts appointed by the parties.”** °

The question here is whether the regulatory framework permitted the regulator, in the
circumstances of the case, to disregard the distributor’s study and to apply its own.
The Parties are in disagreement in this regard.

It is undisputed that EEGSA did not fail to deliver its VAD study. Such study was in
fact commissioned from Bates White and delivered to the CNEE for the first time in
March 2008%, i.e. within the three months’ time-limit provided by Article 98 of the
RLGE, second paragraph. Guatemala has not submitted that EEGSA would not have
timely delivered its VAD study.

Guatemala’s argument is rather that EEGSA failed to correct its study.

The Parties however have opposing views as to the circumstances in which the
distributor should be considered as having failed to correct its study pursuant to
Article 98 of the RLGE.

In a nutshell, the Claimant submits that only those corrections upon which no
disagreement existed, or those which, in case of disagreement, had been approved by
the Expert Commission, had to be implemented.**!

In contrast, Guatemala’s position is that, pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE, and
because the Expert Commission’s conclusions have no binding effect, the distributor
was obliged to implement all the CNEE’s observations, regardless of whether a

disagreement existed.“

. Bernstein and Descazeaux (Exhibit C-9), underlined by the Arbitral Tribunal.

107

540. It should be noted, at this juncture, that whether there was a failure by EEGSA to
correct its study has not been decided as a matter of Guatemalan law by the
Constitutional Court.

54

. Although the Constitutional Court refers, in page 14 of its 24 February 2010
decision*®®, to the fact that the CNEE “realized” that EEGSA had incurred into an
“omission”, and consequently decided to fix the tariff on the basis of its own
independent study, neither EEGSA or the CNEE ever requested the Constitutional
Court to decide whether such an “omission” existed pursuant to Article 98 RLGE.““*

The mention, in the Constitutional Court’s decision, of an “omission” on the part of
EEGSA to implement the corrections, therefore appears to be no more than a factual
reference to the CNEE’s submissions.

542. Likewise, when the Constitutional Court decided that the CNEE was entitled to apply

a tariff calculated on the basis of the VAD established by its own independent

465

study”, it only did so on the basis that, in Guatemalan law, an expert report cannot

be binding and that the law reserves for the regulator the exclusive power to set the

tariffs.4°°

543. The Constitutional Court did therefore not opine on whether, pursuant to Article 98
of the RLGE, EEGSA indeed failed to correct its VAD report.

544. As confirmed by Guatemala’s own submissions in the arbitration: “the Constitutional
Court did not rely on the amended RLGE Article 98 to establish the lawfulness of the

CNEE’s conduct.”**" Guatemala further submits that Article 98 “does not form the

19468 1469

basis for the Court’s decision and “had no influence on the Court’s decision.

54

mw

Nor did the Constitutional Court, as will be seen in further sections of this award,
decide whether, despite the Expert Commission’s report not being binding, the
CNEE nonetheless had the duty to consider it and provide reasons for its decision to
disregard it. Such question will thus have to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal.

54

a

Whether the CNEE was entitled, pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE, to apply a tariff
based on its own independent VAD study raises the fundamental question of the role

of the Expert Commission. Such question will now be addressed.

c) The role of the Expert Commission

54

a

In brief, the Claimant avers that the Expert Commission’s determinations were
binding and that the CNEE was therefore obliged to follow its conclusions.*””

54:

*

It follows from that position that, by refusing to implement those of the CNEE’s

observations on the Bates White study that were disputed and in respect of which the

Expert Commission had not ruled in favor of the CNEE, EEGSA did not fail to

correct its study pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE. As a consequence, the CNEE

was not entitled to fix the tariff on the basis of its own independent study.*7!

549. The Respondent avers, to the contrary, that the Expert Commission’s role was
merely advisory and that its conclusions were therefore not binding upon the
CNEE.*”

550. The Respondent also submits that, according to the regulatory framework, the CNEE

retains the exclusive power to fix the tariffs, and that EEGSA consequently had the

obligation to implement all its observations. According to the Respondent, the Expert

Commission’s role was limited to verifying that EEGSA had done so.

55

. The Respondent submits accordingly that: “given the consultant’s obligation under
the regulatory framework to “incorporate” the corrections required by the CNEE
such that the study would comply with the Terms of Reference (RLGE Article 98), the
only discrepancies that could remain for consideration by the Expert Commission
are: (i) whether the distributor made the corrections; or (ii) whether the corrections
were properly implemented.”**

552. This position is consistent with the position taken by the CNEE in its Resolution No.

144-2008 of July 29, 2008, whereby the CNEE considered, in order to approve the

tariff based on its own independent study, that “according to what is set forth in

current legislation, the National Electric Energy Commission, through Resolution

CNEE-96-2008, recorded the discrepancies with the Tariff Study in writing and

ordered the constitution of the Expert Commission, which remitted its decision on

July twenty-five, two thousand eight, and after analyzing the same, it was confirmed

that the Tariff Study presented by Empresa Eléctrica de Guatemala, Sociedad

Anonima, through Note GG-060-2008, failed to perform all the corrections pursuant
to the observations indicated in Resolution CNEE-63-2008."*"*

Respondent’s view is therefore that EEGSA had the duty to implement all the
corrections requested by the CNEE, and that the Expert Commission’s role was
limited to verifying that “the corrections were properly implemented.”*” As a
consequence, in refusing to incorporate the corrections upon which there was a
disagreement, EEGSA failed to implement the corrections pursuant to Article 98 of
the RLGE and the CNEE was entitled to fix the tariff on the basis of its own
independent study.

The Respondent further took the view that the CNEE could reject the Bates White
study because “EEGSA and Bates White were not cooperative during the tariff

476 and

review process, which cast doubts on the reliability of the Bates White study
because “the Expert Commission confirmed that the Bates White study was flawed”
since “the database submitted by Bates White was [...] not traceable and
interlinked” and was “not accompanied by a_ supporting database.”""" As a
consequence, because the CNEE could not “perform an audit of the model”, it
“believed that the regulations not only allowed, but also required it to approve a
tariff study that was reliable.”**

In order to assess whether such arguments are correct, it is necessary to perform an
analysis of the relevant provisions of the regulatory framework in light of the
decisions made by the Constitutional Court.

The relevant provisions of the LGE and the RLGE in this respect are Article 75 of
the LGE and Article 98, third paragraph, of the RLGE.

Article 75 of the LGE provides in its original Spanish language that: “La [CNEE]
revisard los estudios efectuados y podraé formular observaciones a los mismos. En
caso de discrepancias formuladas por escrito, la [CNEE] y las distribuidoras
deberdn acordar el nombramiento de una Comision Pericial de tres integrantes, uno

nombrado por cada parte y el tercero de comiin acuerdo. La Comision Pericial se

110

pronunciard sobre las discrepancias, en un plazo de 60 dias contados desde su

conformacion.”*”

55}

*

The dispute arises in large part from a difference on the exact meaning of the Spanish
term “se pronunciard” in the final sentence of Article 75. According to the Claimant,
this term means that the Expert Commission had the powers of an adjudicator.**° As
a consequence, the CNEE had the obligation to base the tariff on the Bates White
study as amended in accordance with the determinations of the Expert Commission.
According to the Respondent, this term means that the Expert Commission had to
express a non-binding view, with the consequence that the CNEE had no obligation
to defer to its conclusions. **!

559. As a threshold matter, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that the Constitutional Court made
it very clear, in its decisions of November 18, 2009 and February 24, 2010, that the
report of the Expert Commission would only have an “illustrative or informative”
value, and that the Commission had no power to determine in a binding manner a
dispute between the CNEE and EEGSA.“*?

560. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that this is a point of interpretation of Article 75 of

the LGE that is submitted to Guatemalan law, and in respect of which it is proper to

defer to the decision made by the Constitutional Court.

56

. This being said, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that the Constitutional Court was not
called to decide whether, in spite of the Expert Commission’s report having an
“informative” value, the CNEE nevertheless had the obligation, under the regulatory
framework, to give it serious consideration when establishing the tariff, or to give
reasons for a decision to depart from it.

56:

Nv

. Obviously, the Constitutional Court cannot have intended to say that the CNEE could
arbitrarily and without reasons disregard the Expert Commission’s recommendations.
In fact, at no point in either of its two decisions does the Constitutional Court say that

fixing the tariff would be an entirely discretionary exercise on the part of the

*° English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-17): “The Commission [CNEE] shall review the studies

and the third by mutual agreement. The Expert Commission shall rule on the differences in a period of 60 days counted from
its appointment”.

regulator. And such a conclusion would, for the reasons that will be explained below,
be manifestly at odds with the regulatory framework.

56.

ive)

. It is clear that the regulator did not enjoy unlimited discretion in fixing the tariff. The
entire regulatory framework is based on the premise that it would not be so. In this
respect, the Constitutional Court noted in its decision of November 18, 2009 that it
had not been called to assess the “rationality” of the adopted tariff.“*? Such term can
be understood both with respect to the content of the tariff and with the process
leading to its establishment.

564. What the Constitutional Court intended to say is clearly that, because the CNEE
retains the exclusive power to fix the tariff, such power could not be delegated in all
or part to the Expert Commission. This does not mean, however, that the Expert
Commission’s report should not have been given serious consideration by the CNEE.
It does not mean, either, that the CNEE had unlimited discretion to depart from it
without valid reasons. In addition, the role of the Expert Commission was limited to
the determination of the VAD, which is only an element of the tariff.

565. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that, although the conclusions of the Expert
Commission were not binding in the sense that it had no adjudicatory powers, the
CNEE nevertheless had the duty, under the regulatory framework, to give them
serious consideration and to provide valid reasons in case it decided to depart from
them.

566. This view is confirmed, as will be seen thereafter, by the considerable importance

given to the Expert Commission in the LGE and in the RLGE, as well as in the

behavior of the regulator and the distributor in the tariff review process.

56

x

As an initial matter, the language used in Article 75 of the LGE clearly suggests that,
in case of a disagreement between the CNEE and the distributor on the distributor’s
VAD report, such disagreement would be resolved on the basis of a determination
made by the Expert Commission.

56:

*

If the Expert Commission’s role had only been, as Respondent suggests, to make
sure that the observations made by the CNEE had been fully implemented by the
distributor, this sentence would make no sense whatsoever. It is clear in Article 75 of

the LGE that the Expert Commission’s role was to provide a solution to

485 Exhibit C-331, p. 20 (English version).

disagreements between the CNEE and the distributor, not to act as the guardian of
the regulator’s views.

Likewise, if the Expert Commission’s role was only that of an expert to the CNEE,
there would have been no need whatsoever for a rule such as Article 75 of the LGE.
According to Article 5 of the LGE, the CNEE could at any time contract experts as it
saw fit.** It is clear that the intervention of the Expert Commission was provided for

the benefit of both parties, in the context of a bilateral cooperative process.

. The bilateral nature of expertise proceedings is confirmed by the language used in

Article 98 of the RLGE, which provides that the fees of the third member of the
Expert Commission are paid in equal shares by the CNEE and the distributor.

Of even more relevance to the Arbitral Tribunal is the fact that the LGE intended the
Expert Commission to be a neutral body. Article 75 of the LGE provides, to that
effect, that the Expert Commission would be composed of three members, one
appointed by each party and the third one by agreement of the parties.

This constitution mechanism, similar to that of an arbitral tribunal, shows that the
LGE intended to make sure that the Expert Commission, in pronouncing itself on the
parties’ differences, would act in a neutral manner.

The facts of the case show that the parties have devoted a considerable amount of
care to the manner in which the Expert Commission would be constituted in order to
make sure that it would act in a neutral manner. For example, the parties verified the
absence of conflicts of interest of its members, which is exactly what would have
been done for an adjudicating body.**

The Arbitral Tribunal draws two conclusions from such facts.

The first is that, contrary to Respondent’s contention, the role of the Expert
Commission was not limited to verifying that all the CNEE’s observations were
implemented in the distributor’s VAD study. The Expert Commission was not the
guardian of the interest of the CNEE, but a neutral body whose task was to provide,
in a non-binding manner, solutions to the disputes between the parties.

The second is that the conclusions of the Expert Commission were meant to have a

greater authoritative value than those of a consultant that the regulator could have

contracted for its own benefit. If the regulator had the discretion to disregard the
Expert Commission’s conclusions without providing any reasons, the regulatory
framework would make no sense.

It follows that the distributor could not have the obligation to implement corrections
to its VAD report upon which a disagreement had properly been submitted to the
Expert Commission.

Because the Expert Commission’s role was to permit the resolution of disputes
between the parties, it makes perfect sense to construe Article 98 of the RLGE, third
paragraph, as subjecting the distributor’s obligation to make the corrections
requested by the CNEE to the pronouncement of the Expert Commission in case of
disagreement.

It would in fact be entirely nonsensical for the regulatory framework to provide that,
in case of a disagreement between the CNEE and the distributor on the distributor’s
VAD study, a neutral Expert Commission would be constituted to pronounce itself
(Article 75 of the LGE), and at the same time to oblige the distributor to immediately
incorporate any such point of disagreement in its VAD study.

It would be even more nonsensical to allow the regulator to unilaterally impose its
own VAD study because observations upon which there were disagreements and that
were subject to a pending pronouncement of the Expert Commission had not been

immediately incorporated in the VAD study.

. The regulatory framework clearly provides otherwise. Pursuant to Article 75 of the

LGE and Article 98 of the RLGE, once the distributor has submitted its VAD study,
the CNEE makes its observations and, unless there is a disagreement properly
submitted to the Expert Commission, the distributor has to correct the study
accordingly. In case of a disagreement referred to the Expert Commission, however,
the distributor has no obligation to immediately correct its VAD study until the
Expert Commission has pronounced itself. Article 98 of the RLGE, third paragraph,
provides to that effect that, once the regulator has made its observations “if
discrepancies between the Commission and the distributor persist, the procedure
stipulated in Article 75 of the Law shall be followed”.

The regulatory framework is less clear as to the deference that the CNEE had to give
to the Expert Commission’s report. As said above, although the Expert Commission
had no adjudicatory powers and although its report was, in the words of the

Constitutional Court, technically “informative”, the importance given to the Expert

114

Commission in the LGE and the RLGE, as well as the behavior of the parties to the
tariff review process, show that the distributor was entitled to expect that the
Commission’s conclusions be seriously considered and taken into account by the
regulator in fixing the VAD.

58

»

In view of the Arbitral Tribunal, the regulator could not decide to disregard the

Expert Commission’s pronouncements without providing any reason. The obligation

to provide reasons derives from both the regulatory framework and from the

international obligations of the State under the minimum standard.

584. Under the regulatory framework, it would be entirely inconsistent to provide for an
expert determination mechanism while at the same time allowing the regulator to
disregard the Expert Commission’s conclusions without any reasons. Admitting that
the regulator could ignore the Expert Commission’s conclusions without providing
any reason would be tantamount to assimilating the Expert Commission to a
consultant contracted by the regulator in its own interest, which is clearly not what
was intended by the LGE and the RLGE.

58

on

. First, the Parties would not have devoted so much care and attention to the expert
determination process if the regulator had the right to entirely ignore the conclusions
of the Expert Commission without providing reasons. Second, as said in earlier
sections of this award, the Expert Commission was a neutral body, which was
established by the regulatory framework in the interest of both parties.

586. In addition, the obligation for the regulator to provide reasons derives from the

regulatory framework itself. Article 75 of the LGE and Article 98 of the RLGE

oblige the regulator to provide its observations on the distributor’s VAD study in

writing. The distributor would otherwise be unable to explain why there is a

disagreement on such observations and to refer such disagreement to the Expert

Commission. It is in this respect undisputed that the observations made by the CNEE

on Bates White’s VAD study were indeed made in writing and carefully reasoned.*°

There is no reason not to apply the same principle to the regulator’s decision to

depart from the Expert Commission’s pronouncements.

58

x

Under the minimum standard, international law prohibits State officials from

exercising their authority in an abusive, arbitrary or discriminatory manner. Article

486 See the CNEE’s observations of April 11, 2008 (Exhibit C-193), and Resolution No. 96-2008 of May 16, 2008,
establishing the discrepancies (Exhibit C-209).

11S

10.5 CAFTA-DR also obliges the State to observe due process in administrative
proceedings. A lack of reasons may be relevant to assess whether a given decision
was arbitrary and whether there was lack of due process in administrative
proceedings. As renowned authors have put it: “if State officials can demonstrate that
the decision was actually made in an objective and rational (i.e. reasoned) manner,
they will defeat any claim made under the standard. If they cannot, the arbitrary
conduct must be remedied.”**’ It is particularly so in the context of a tariff review
process that is based on the parties’ good faith cooperation, and in the context of
which the parties had contemplated the intervention of a neutral body to resolve
differences.

58)

oo

. In sum, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that, although the conclusions of the Expert
Commission were not technically binding upon the CNEE, the CNEE had the duty to
seriously consider them and to provide its reasons in case it would decide to
disregard them.

589. The Arbitral Tribunal also concludes that, pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE, the

distributor was under no obligation to incorporate in its VAD study observations

made by the CNEE in respect of which there was a disagreement properly submitted
to the Expert Commission. Unless the regulator provided valid reasons to the
contrary, it is only if and when the Expert Commission had pronounced itself in

favor of the regulator that such an obligation would arise.

d) Whether the distributor’s consultant and the Expert Commission could
depart from the Terms of Reference
590. Another point of disagreement between the Parties is whether the distributor’s
consultant and the Expert Commission could depart from the Terms of Reference.

59

. Pursuant to Article of the 74 LGE, second paragraph, the CNEE had to establish
terms of reference for each distributor’s VAD study. Accordingly, in January 2008,
the CNEE established Terms of Reference to be followed by Bates White in the
making of its VAD study.

592. The Parties are essentially in disagreement on one important provision of the ToR,
namely Article 1.10, which provides that “These ToR set forth the guidelines to

and defined studies. If there are changes in the methodologies set forth in the Study
Reports, which must be fully justified, the CNEE shall make such observations
regarding the changes as it deems necessary, confirming that they are consistent
with the guidelines for the Study. These terms of reference do not constitute a legal
or regulatory modification, and therefore, in case of a controversy between one of
the provisions of these terms of reference and the Law or the Regulations, the
provisions of the latter shall prevail, in all cases applying the principle of legal
hierarchy. In addition, any omission of these terms of reference, relative to aspects
defined in the Law and the Regulations for tariff matters, shall be understood to be
incorporated into the TOR”. 488

The Claimant contends that Article 1.10 permitted the distributor’s consultant to
depart from the Terms of Reference in order to ensure that the VAD study would
comport with the regulatory framework.**?

The Respondent, to the contrary, contends that Article 1.10 had a restricted scope
and that only those changes that would be consistent with the Terms of Reference
themselves could be introduced.*””

As the Arbitral Tribunal sees it, Article 1.10 of the Terms of Reference establishes
two clear principles.

The first is that the Terms of Reference are “guidelines” (“lineamientos” in the
original Spanish version), which term suggests a certain degree of generality and
flexibility.*”! In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, such term would not have been used if
the drafters of the Terms of Reference had not intended to preserve a certain degree
of flexibility in its application by the distributor’s consultant and the Expert
Commission.

Guatemala avers, in this respect, that the Terms of Reference were “mandatory”
The Tribunal understands this submission in the sense that the Terms of Reference
were binding upon the distributor and the Expert Commission. The Arbitral Tribunal
can however only note that such term is not to be found in Article 1.10, and does not

exist in the LGE and the RLGE.

598. Article 1.10, a provision that was intensely negotiated with the distributor’, was
precisely designed to define the extent to which the Terms of Reference would be
binding, and it is against the provisions of Article 1.10 that the binding effect of the
Terms of Reference needs to be assessed.

599. The second principle established in Article 1.10 is that the possibility of variations
was admitted. Article 1.10, first paragraph, provides the possibility of “changes in
the methodologies set forth in the Study Reports”, which must then be “fully
justified’. Such changes are changes to the methodologies proposed in the Terms of
Reference.

600. The last part of the first paragraph of Article 1.10 also provides that any such change
needs to be consistent with “the guidelines for the study”. The meaning of this last
sentence is unclear and has been discussed at length at the hearing.

601. According to the testimony of the president of the CNEE, Carlos Colom Bickford,
who was president of the CNEE at the time of the facts, the terms “guidelines for the
study” at the end of the first paragraph of Article 1.10 are a reference to the Terms of
Reference themselves.*** However, it seems rather circular to say that the Terms of
Rerference are “guidelines” and that any variation from such guidelines needs to be
consistent with the guidelines themselves.

602. Mr Giacchino from Bates White, and a former member of the Expert Commission,
testified that the terms “guidelines for the study” referred to the regulatory
framework.*”°

603. This matter has been specifically discussed by the Expert Commission in its report.
The Expert Commission considered that “the duly justified deviations allowed by the
Terms of Reference must lead to an application of a methodology in the tariff study
that best reflects the requirements of the LGE and the RLGE”.“*°

604. The Expert Commission thus opined that Article 1.10 permitted the distributor’s
consultant, under the control of the Expert Commission, to depart from the Terms of
Reference in order to ensure that the VAD study would comport with the regulatory

framework.

As it is known, the CNEE did not, when it received the report, specifically object to
such finding. It is only in the context of this arbitration that the Respondent
developed an argument to the contrary.

606. The Arbitral Tribunal sees no reason to revisit the Expert Commission’s finding in
this respect. In fact, the Expert Commission’s interpretation of Article 1.10 seems
entirely reasonable: if the Terms of Reference were guidelines that could - according
to its own terms - be varied, it is perfectly acceptable to consider that such variations
had to be consistent with the principles set forth in the LGE and the RLGE.

60)

a

Such finding of the Arbitral Tribunal is confirmed by the language of Article 1.10,
second paragraph. Article 1.10, second paragraph, clearly establishes the principle
that “in case of a controversy between one of the provisions of these terms of
reference and the Law or the Regulations, the provisions of the latter shall prevail, in
all cases applying the principle of legal hierarchy.”

*

Guatemala objects that, in case of a divergence between the Terms of Reference and
the regulatory framework, the only recourse open to the distributor was a judicial
challenge against the Terms of Reference.*”’ The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees.

60!

©

Article 1.10 was designed precisely to allow the distributor’s consultant, under the
control of the Expert Commission, to depart from the Terms of Reference in case the
Terms of Reference would not comport with the regulatory framework, thus avoiding
the delays and complications of a judicial challenge.

610. This is of course not to say that the distributor or the Expert Commission had
unfettered discretion to amend the Terms of Reference as they saw fit. Article 1.10
provides that any variation must be “fully justified’ and be consistent with the

regulatory framework.

2. The alleged representations of the Respondent and Claimant’s legitimate
expectations at the time of the investment

611. TECO avers that Guatemala made specific representations that induced the Claimant
to invest in the country’s electricity sector’, and then frustrated the legitimate

expectations arising therefrom.*”

The representations allegedly made by the Respondent were (i) that the VAD would
be calculated on the new replacement value of an efficient company asset base™, (ii)
that EEGSA’s consultant would calculate the VAD*!, and (iii) that disputes
concerning the same would be resolved by an Expert Commission.>”

The Claimant’s arguments regarding the existence of representations made by
Guatemala are essentially based on certain statements made in occasion of a
presentation made by Guatemala in preparation for the privatization®™’, as well as in
the Memorandum of Sale prepared at the time by Salomon Smith Barney as
EEGSA’s financial consultant.°*

Page 19 of the presentation states that “any material change in tariff methodology
must be supported by a study conducted by an_ internationally recognized
independent consultant.”°° As for the Memorandum of Sale, it is more specific and
states, in the relevant parts relating to the regulatory framework, that “VADs must be
calculated by distributors by means of a study commissioned from an engineering
firm, but the Commission may dictate that the studies be grouped by density. The
Commission will review those studies and can make observations, but in the event of
discrepancy, a Commission of three experts will be convened to resolve the
differences.”

Attached to the Memorandum of Sale was an English-language draft of the future
law of electricity, providing in Article 75 that “the Commission [CNEE] shall review
the studies performed and may make comments on the same. In case of differences
made in writing, the Commission and the distributors shall agree on the appointment
of an Expert Commission made of three members, one appointed by each party and
the third by mutual agreement. The Expert Commission shall rule on the differences
in a period of 60 days counted from its appointment.”* o7

The Respondent objects that any legitimate expectation can only belong to the entity
having invested at the time of the privatization of EEGSA, and could not be

transferred to the Claimant, who only acquired its shares in EEGSA in 2005.°°* The

Respondent also submits that legitimate expectations are not protected under the
minimum standard of treatment.*” The Respondent further submits that the
presentation and the Memorandum of Sale are in any event general and non-binding
documents that could not, at the time, be understood as specific representations made
by the State to the investor.°!° Respondent finally objects that, in absence of a
stabilization clause, the presentation and the Memorandum of Sale could not be
understood as a representation that the regulatory framework would not change.*!!

In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, in a regulatory context, a distinction needs to be
made between the expectations arising from a specific representation that the legal
framework will not change in all or in part, and the general expectation that the legal
framework will not be applied arbitrarily.

The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the presentation and the
Memorandum of Sale did not include any specific representation that the regulatory
framework would not evolve.

Such question is in any event irrelevant. As will be seen in further sections of this

award?!

, the State will not be found responsible based on a lack of stability of the
regulatory framework. Indeed, the amendments introduced in 2007 to the RLGE did
not alter the fundamental principles upon which the regulatory framework was based.
The basis for the State’s responsibility is rather its repudiation of such fundamental
principles and its breach of due process in administrative matters.

The legitimate expectations upon which the Claimant relies are rather that the LGE

and the RLGE would be applied in a fair and non-arbitrary manner.

. It is clear, in the eyes of the Arbitral Tribunal, that any investor has the expectation

that the relevant applicable legal framework will not be disregarded or applied in an
arbitrary manner. However, that kind of expectation is irrelevant to the assessment of
whether a State should be held liable for the arbitrary conduct of one of its organs.°!?
What matters is whether the State’s conduct has objectively been arbitrary, not what

the investor expected years before the facts. A willful disregard of the law or an

arbitrary application of the same by the regulator constitutes a breach of the
minimum standard, with no need to resort to the doctrine of legitimate expectations.
622. There is therefore no need to dwell any further on the Parties’ arguments on
representations and legitimate expectations. In particular, there is no need for the
Tribunal to deal with the Parties’ arguments as to whether the Claimant is entitled to

rely on the alleged expectations of the entity that invested in EEGSA in 1998.

3. The Respondent’s behavior

623. The Claimant alleges that Guatemala breached the minimum standard by (a)
amending to its own advantage article 98 of the RLGE, (b) manipulating the Terms
of Reference and failing to cooperate in good faith with EEGSA during the tariff
review process, (c) dissolving the Expert Commission, (d) refusing to consider the
Expert Commission’s report and fixing the tariff based on its own consultant’s VAD

study and (e) retaliating against EEGSA.

a) The amendments to RLGE Article 98

62.

aa

Claimant first submits that Guatemala, in breach of its international obligations,
amended Article 98 the RLGE to permit, in certain circumstances, the tariff to be
fixed on the basis of the regulator’s independent study rather than on the distributor’s
study.> 4

62:

n

. In the RLGE as adopted in 1997, Article 98 provided that, in the event that the
distributor did not submit its study or the corrections requested by the regulator, the
previous tariff would remain in force on a provisional basis. Article 98, as amended
in 2007, provides that, in the same circumstances, the CNEE is entitled to publish the
tariff on the basis of its own independent study.

626. As an initial matter, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that Claimant’s

claims are time barred insofar as they are based on such purportedly illegal

amendment of Article 98.

627. Article 10.18.1 of the CAFTA-DR provides that “[no] claim may be submitted to

x

arbitration pursuant to this Section if more than three years have elapsed from the
date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge

of the breach alleged [...].”

632.

In the case at hand, the amendment in dispute was published in the Diario de Centro-
America in March 2007°'°. As a consequence, the Claimant should have been aware
of the amendment at that date or shortly thereafter. A claim that the Respondent, by
adopting the amendment, breached its obligations under the treaty was therefore
time-barred as from March 2010. As the Arbitral Tribunal sees it, and contrary to
Claimant’s submission*"®, this is not a matter of jurisdiction but of admissibility. It is
thus irrelevant that the Respondent*”” failed to raise, in its Memorial of Jurisdiction
and Admissibility, a jurisdictional objection in this respect.

At any rate, this argument is ill-grounded. As rightly pointed out by the Respondent,
Guatemala never agreed or represented that the regulatory framework would remain
unchanged. In absence of a stabilization clause, it is perfectly acceptable that the
State amends the relevant laws and regulations as appropriate.°!* It is only if a
change to the regulatory framework is made in bad faith or with the intent to deprive
the investor of the benefits of its investment that it could entail the State’s
international responsibility.

In the case at hand, the Arbitral Tribunal does not find the amendment to Article 98
RLGE to be unfair or arbitrary. If properly interpreted, Article 98 of the RLGE as
amended does not give unfettered discretion to the regulator to apply its own
independent study. In fact, as explained in earlier sections of this award’!?, the
amendment only permits the tariff to be based on the regulator’s own study in two

limited circumstances.

. The first is when the distributor entirely fails to submit its study. In such a case, it is

entirely understandable that the regulator would not be willing to freeze the previous
tariff.

The second is when the distributor fails to implement the corrections requested by
the regulator. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that, as interpreted by
Guatemala (i.e. that a failure by the distributor to apply changes upon which there is

a disagreement submitted to the Expert Commission allows the regulator to

immediately fix the tariff on the basis of its own study) would lead to the absurd

result of rendering the expert determination procedure meaningless and to grant to

the regulator unfettered discretion to fix the tariff. However, the Arbitral Tribunal

has determined that such is not the meaning of RLGE Article 98 as amended.*”°

633. RLGE Article 98 as amended, in referring to a distributor’s failure to correct the
VAD study, obviously applies to those corrections that are not in dispute, or in
respect of which the Expert Commission found in favor of the regulator (or in respect
of which the regulator would, after due consideration, have in good faith expressed
reasons to disregard the report of the Expert Commission). The Arbitral Tribunal
does not find it objectionable that, should the distributor fail to incorporate the
corrections in such a situation, the regulator could decide to use its own independent
study.

63.

-

In assessing whether the 2007 amendment to article 98 is open to criticism, the
Arbitral Tribunal also finds it relevant that the Claimant did not at the time object to
the amendment, either by way of an informal complaint or by way of a recurso de
amparo.

63

um

The second argument made by the Claimant regarding the alleged abuse of the
State’s power relates to the introduction in the RLGE, on May 19, 2008, of an Article
98bis pursuant to which, in case of disagreement between the regulator and the
distributor, the third member of the Expert Commission would be appointed by the
Ministry of Energy.™!

636. It is however undisputed that Article 98bis of the RLGE did not apply to the 2008-
2013 tariff due to the principle of non-retroactivity in Guatemalan law.

63)

x

In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, because the Claimant sold its interest in EGGSA in
October 2010 and did not therefore participate in the 2013-2018 tariff review
process, it has no interest to claim damages as a consequence of the potentially
harmful consequences of that change.

63)

oo

. Based on the foregoing, the arbitral Tribunal rejects Claimant’s arguments related to
the abuse of the State’s powers with respect to the amendments to article 98 of the

RLGE.

124

b) The alleged manipulations of the Terms of Reference by the CNEE and
the alleged lack of cooperation of the CNEE in the tariff review process

639. The Claimant makes a series of allegations according to which the CNEE (i):

640.

641.

642.

64:

»

attempted to include in the Terms of Reference a new Article 1.9 granting it
unlimited discretion to declare EEGSA’s VAD study as not received>”, (ii) inserted
in the Terms of Reference an FRC formula that was inconsistent with the regulatory
framework™®, (iii) failed to cooperate in good faith to the tariff review process*™* and
(iv) tried to unduly influence the Expert Commission.*”

As to the argument relating to the attempt by the CNEE to include a new Article 1.9
in the Terms of Reference, it is undisputed that the CNEE agreed to replace the
proposed new Article 1.9 with the current Article 1.8 of the Terms of Reference,

which has not been objected by the Claimant.*”°

As a consequence, Claimant’s
Article 1.9 argument is irrelevant.

The Claimant makes a series of other allegations according to which the Terms of
Reference “contained provisions that predetermine the results of the VAD study, in
violation of LGE Article 74,777 However, the Claimant also submits that, as a
consequence of the introduction of such provisions, the Parties agreed on Article
1.10 of the Terms of Reference as a safeguard, and EEGSA withdrew its amparo.>8
As a consequence, such allegations are also irrelevant.

As to Claimant’s allegation that the Respondent acted in a “manifestly arbitrary
manner by adding an FRC formula to EEGSA’s 2008-2013 Terms of Rerference that
was inconsistent with the regulatory framework”, it is inconsistent with Claimant’s
position that the regulator accepted to introduce flexibility in Article 1.10 through the
concept of guidelines and by opening the door to variations in order to ensure that the
Terms of Reference would effectively comport with the regulatory framework.

If the regulator accepted (as the Arbitral Tribunal found in earlier sections of this
award) that the distributor’s VAD study could depart from the Terms of Reference

on points where the Terms of Reference would not be consistent with the regulatory

522 Claimant PHB, §§ 118 et seq.

  

~~ Ibid., § 130 et seq.

125

framework, the introduction in the Terms of Reference of an FRC formula which
was allegedly at odds with the law could not have caused any harm because such
discrepancy could in any event have been corrected by the distributor’s consultant
itself under the control of the Expert Commission.

644. The Claimant further submits that, in the course of the tariff review process, “the
CNEE refused to hold any meaningful discussions with EEGSA and Bates White
regarding EEGSA’s VAD study, despite EEGSA’s repeated requests.”* 5° The Arbitral
Tribunal does not find support in the record for such a submission. Quite to the
contrary, the facts show that the regulator had continuous and intensive contacts with
the distributor. In addition, such an allegation, if proved, would not materialize a
breach of the State’s obligations under the minimum standard in international law.

645. The Claimant finally submits that the CNEE attempted to manipulate the tariff
review process and to unduly influence the Expert Commission.

646. The Claimant submits, first of all, that the CNEE abused its powers in the context of
the establishment of the Expert Commission’s Operating Rules by unduly trying to
introduce a provision stating that the Expert Commission’s report would not be
binding upon the CNEE.**!

647. As an initial matter, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that neither the LGE nor the RLGE
make any reference to the establishment of Operating Rules for the Expert
Commission. As a consequence, although the regulator and the distributor attempted
to establish such Operating Rules, there was no obligation on the part of the regulator
to bring such discussions to a positive conclusion.

64

*

The Parties are in disagreement as to whether the regulator and the distributor
ultimately agreed on Operating Rules for the Expert Commission. Claimant relies on
Mr Colom’s — the former president of the CNEE and a witness presented by
Guatemala — testimony to aver that there was such an agreement on the Operating
Rules, which Guatemala arbitrarily disavowed.” To the contrary, Guatemala
submits that, although there was an informal agreement on parts of the Operating

Rules, a formal decision to adopt a full set of Operating Rules for the Expert

5% Thid., § 136.
S| Ibid., § 142
5% Ibid., § 145; Transcript, Day 5, p. 1120, §§ 3-18.

126

Commission should have been made in writing and in compliance with the forms
required by Guatemalan administrative law.

649. The Arbitral Tribunal finds no evidence in the record that Operating Rules were ever
agreed between the regulator and the distributor. The only basis for the Claimant’s
averment that such an agreement existed is exhibit C-218, consisting of an e-mail
from Mr. Calleja of EEGSA to Mr. Giacchino, forwarding draft Operating Rules and
stating that they had been approved. However, Mr. Calleja’s mail was not copied to
the CNEE and there is no evidence in the record that the CNEE ever agreed to what
Mr. Calleja understood to be the final Operating Rules.

650. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore rejects the Claimant’s arguments that the CNEE
arbitrarily disavowed the agreed Operating Rules.

651. The Claimant also submits that the CNEE tried to unduly influence the Expert
Commission during the tariff review process by having ex parte contacts with its
appointee, Mr. Riubrugent, while its own appointee, Mr. Giacchino, refrained from
any such contacts.°**

652. The Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced that, in communicating with Mr. Riubrugent,
the regulator acted improperly. The regulator may well have believed, in the absence
of Operating Rules and in the absence of a legal framework applying in Guatemalan
law to such expert proceedings, that each party could have contact with its own

appointee in order to ensure the efficacy of the expert proceedings.

c) The CNEE’s decision to dissolve the Expert Commission

65:

»

The CNEE received the Expert Commission’s report on Friday July 25, 2008 at 4:00
pm.**> On Monday July 28, 2008, the CNEE sent to EEGSA its Resolution No. 3121
dissolving the Expert Commission “by virtue of having met the purpose of its
appointment.”**©

654. The Claimant submits that the CNEE “unilaterally dissolved the Expert Commission
and threatened its own appointed expert in order to prevent the Expert Commission
from reviewing and approving Bates White’s VAD study under rule 12”, and that by

so doing “it undermined the very legal and regulatory framework that Guatemala

5M Claimant PHB, §§ 148 et seq.
* Exhibit R-88.

$6 Exhibit C-247.

127

had adopted to depoliticize the tariff review process and to encourage foreign

investment in its electricity sector."

655. The Arbitral Tribunal, however, found that the Expert Commission’s Operating
Rules, including the proposed rule 12 providing that the Expert Commission would
continue to operate after its report to verify its implementation, had not been
approved by the CNEE. In addition, there is nothing in the LGE or the RLGE
providing or suggesting that the Expert Commission would have the role of verifying
whether and how its pronouncements had been incorporated in the VAD study.

656. The Claimant avers that, because the Expert Commission “is appointed based upon
the agreement of both parties, [...] neither the CNEE nor the Distributor [...] has the
authority to dissolve [it] unilaterally.”** However, what is relevant in the eyes of the
Arbitral Tribunal is that the LGE and the RLGE only provide for the Expert
Commission to pronounce itself on differences regarding the distributor’s VAD
study and that no provision is made concerning the implementation of its own
pronouncements.

657. As a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the CNEE was entitled, once its
report had been submitted, to dissolve the Expert Commission. Clearly, the CNEE
might have taken the view that keeping the Expert Commission alive was appropriate
or useful in order to assist it in the implementation of its report. It nevertheless chose
not to do so, and such choice does not constitute a manifest abuse of power or an
arbitrary decision that would be in breach of the State’s international obligations

under the minimum standard of treatment.

d) The CNEE’s rejection of the Expert Commission’s report and decision
to fix the tariff based on its own consultant’s VAD study

65)

*

On July 29, 2008, the CNEE adopted its Resolution No. 144-2008, whereby it
decided to fix the tariff on the basis of the VAD report prepared by its own
consultant Sigla.

659. Resolution No. 144-2008 reads in its relevant parts as follows:

“That according to the methodology established in the Terms of Reference, in
numeral 1.10 it was established that the National Electric Energy Commission
was to verify any variations from what was established in such terms, and as

‘7 Reply, § 158.
538 Thid., § 167

128

recorded in the administrative case file, during the stage of supervising the
progress of such studies, and in accordance with article 74 of the General Law
of Electricity, the Commission [CNEE] issued comments to the Distributor,
pointing out that such variations were not justified according to the
methodology and guidelines of the study.

CONSIDERING:

That through a note identified as GG-045-2008 dated March thirty-one, two
thousand eight, Empresa Eléctrica de Guatemala, Sociedad Anénima remitted
to this Commission [CNEE] the Tariff Study for it to be declared valid
according to what was established in article 98 of the Regulations of the
General Law of Electricity, and that on April eleven, two thousand eight, the
National Electric Energy Commission, through Resolution CNEE-63-2008,
declared such study to be invalid, making the corresponding observations, for
the study to be corrected by the Distributor through its consulting company,
requiring that it conform to the Terms of Reference.

CONSIDERING:

That on May five, two thousand eight, Empresa Eléctrica de Guatemala,
Sociedad Anénima, through Note GG-060-2008, once again submitted to the
National Electric Energy Commission the Tariff Study, failing to correct all of
the observations made by the National Electric Energy Commission through
said Resolution CNEE-63- 2008, as established by article 98 of the Regulations
of the General Law of Electricity.

CONSIDERING:

That according to what is set forth in current legislation, the National Electric
Energy Commission, through Resolution CNEE-96-2008, recorded the
discrepancies with the Tariff Study in writing and ordered the constitution of
the Expert Commission, which remitted its decision on July twenty-five, two
thousand eight, and after analyzing same, it was confirmed that the Tariff
Study presented by Empresa Eléctrica de Guatemala, Sociedad Anénima,
through Note GG-060-2008, failed to perform all the corrections pursuant to
the observations indicated in Resolution CNEE-63-2008.

CONSIDERING:

That based on article 98 and 99 of the Regulations of the General Law of

Electricity, the National Electric Energy Commission, by legal mandate, is

129

charged with approving a tariff study that is the basis for the setting of
definitive tariffs.
THEREFORE:
The National Electric Energy Commission, based on the above considerations
and the cited laws and regulations,
RESOLVES:
I. To definitively approve the Tariff Study prepared by the Association of
companies made up of SISTEMAS ELECTRICOS Y ELECTRONICOS DE
POTENCIA, CONTROL Y COMUNICACIONES, SOCIEDAD ANONIMA AND
SIGLA, SOCIEDAD ANONIMA, which shall be the basis to issue and publish
the tariff schedule corresponding to Empresa Eléctrica de Guatemala,
Sociedad Anénima.

660. According to the Claimant, EEGSA’s decision “to impose its own unreasonably low
VAD on EEGSA reflects a willful and deliberate disregard of the legal and
regulatory framework? °°

. The Respondent, to the contrary, avers that under the regulatory framework, and in
particular pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE, once it had received the Expert
Commission’s report, the CNEE could either elect to correct the distributor’s VAD
study itself or, if it found such study to be unsatisfactory, to use the report prepared
by its own consultant.**!

Still according to the Respondent, once it received the Expert Commission’s report,
the CNEE realized that it would have taken “up to five weeks to incorporate certain
pronouncements into the study, which made it impossible to correct the study within
the available time remaining, furthermore, given that the Bates White model was not
“linked”, it was impossible to incorporate certain changes and carry out a
sensibility analysis in an efficient manner”. In addition “Bates White’s refusal to
provide [an auditable study for over seven months] created doubts about the integrity

of the study and of the advisability of amending in?

The Respondent also avers that, when it received the corrected Bates White study on
July 28, 2008, “the Tariff Division concluded a preliminary review and verified that
the models were neither supported nor linked and that the database was still a simple
excel file without any automation to allow quick verification of the sources of
efficient prices within the remaining two days.”*8

The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent for the reasons that will be
explained below. In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, in adopting Resolution No. 144-
2008, in disregarding without providing reasons the Expert Commission’s report, and
in unilaterally imposing a tariff based on its own consultant’s VAD calculation, the
CNEE acted arbitrarily and in violation of fundamental principles of due process in

regulatory matters.

. In so doing, the CNEE in fact repudiated the two fundamental principles upon which

the tariff review process regulatory framework is premised: the principle that, save in
the limited exceptions provided by the LGE and the RLGE, the tariff would be based
ona VAD calculation made by a prequalified consultant appointed by the distributor;
and the principle that, in case of a disagreement between the regulator and the
distributor, such disagreement would be resolved having regard to the conclusions of
a neutral Expert Commission.

As an initial matter, it is at this juncture necessary to summarize the Arbitral
Tribunal’s findings regarding the interpretation of the regulatory framework.

First, the Arbitral Tribunal found that, pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE, the
regulator is entitled to fix the tariff on the basis of his own VAD study only in two
limited circumstances, i.e. when the distributor fails to submit its study and when the
distributor fails to correct its study according to the observations of the regulator.**
Second, the Arbitral Tribunal found that, because the regulatory framework provides
that a neutral Expert Commission would pronounce itself on any disagreement
regarding the observations of the regulator, RLGE Article 98 only mandates the
distributor to implement such observations in respect of which (i) there is no
disagreement, or (ii), in case of disagreement, the Expert Commission pronounced
itself in favor of the regulator (unless the regulator expresses valid reasons to depart

from the experts’ pronouncements).***

Third, the Arbitral Tribunal found that the role of the Expert Commission was not, as
Respondent contends, to verify that all the observations made by the regulator on the
VAD study were implemented by the distributor’s consultant. The role of the Expert
Commission was rather to pronounce itself on any disagreement regarding such
observations™°, which implies that the Expert Commission could make findings
either in favor or against the regulator.

The Arbitral Tribunal finally found that, although the findings of the Expert
Commission are not technically binding in the sense that the Expert Commission has
no adjudicatory powers, the regulator had the duty to give them serious consideration

and to provide reasons in the case it decided to depart from them.”

. Based on those principles, the Arbitral Tribunal will now assess whether Resolution

No. 144-2008 is arbitrary and constitutes a breach of the State’s international
obligations under the minimum standard of treatment.

As an initial matter, it is relevant that the Resolution was not based on the fact that
the Expert Commission’s report did not comport with the regulatory framework. It is
not based, either, on a failure by Bates White to incorporate in its report the Expert

Commission’s pronouncements on the observations in dispute.

- Resolution 144-2008 is rather based on the fact that the distributor omitted to

implement in its study “all of the observations made by the National Electric Energy

Commission through [...] Resolution CNEE-63- 2008”.

. Resolution 63-2008 is the April 11, 2008 decision whereby the regulator made its

observations on the first version of the Bates White VAD study.

As a consequence, the regulator’s decision to apply its own VAD study was based on
the fact that the distributor had failed to incorporate in its report all the observations
as made in April 2008. Such alleged failure was therefore irrespective of the fact that
there was a disagreement on such observations, and that the same had been referred
to the Expert Commission.

The CNEE’s decision is consistent with the Respondent’s position that the role of the
Expert Commission was limited to verifying that the distributor’s consultant had

implemented all of its observations.

by the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court made it clear that the Expert
Commission had an advisory role, which implies that it had to provide its views in
case of disagreement on the CNEE’s observations. Given that the regulatory
framework establishes the Expert Commission as a neutral body, it is clear that such

views could be in favor or against the regulator.

. Resolution 144-2008 shows, however, that the CNEE did not consider the report of

the Expert Commission as the pronouncement of a neutral panel of experts which it
had to take into account in establishing the tariff. The CNEE rather used the expert
report to ascertain that some of the observations it had made in April 2008 had not
been incorporated in the study, regardless of whether there was a disagreement, and
irrespective of the views that had been expressed by the experts on such
disagreements. In other words, the CNEE failed without any reasons to take the
Expert Commission’s pronouncements into account.

The Arbitral Tribunal also considers that the regulator’s decision to apply its own
consultant’s study does not comport with Article 98 of the RLGE.

As a matter of fact, in order for the regulator’s decision to comport with Article 98, it
should have said that the distributor failed to correct its study according to the
pronouncements of the Expert Commission, or explained why the regulator decided
not to accept the Expert Commission’s pronouncements.

The Arbitral Tribunal therefore concludes that Resolution No. 144-2008 is
inconsistent with the regulatory framework. By rejecting the distributor’s study
because it had failed to incorporate the totality of the observations that the CNEE had
made in April 2008, with no regard and no reference to the conclusions of the Expert
Commission, the CNEE acted arbitrarily and in breach of the administrative process
established for the tariff review.

In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, both the regulatory framework and the minimum
standard of treatment in international law obliged the CNEE to act in a manner that
was consistent with the fundamental principles on the tariff review process in
Guatemalan law.

The CNEE, once it had received the Expert Commission’s report, should have
analyzed it and taken its conclusions onboard in establishing a tariff based on the

Bates White VAD study, unless it had good reasons to consider that such conclusions

133

were inconsistent with the regulatory framework, in which case it had the obligation
to provide valid reasons to that effect. However, no such reasons were provided.

684. Guatemala avers that incorporating the Expert Commission’s pronouncements in the
Bates White’s study would have taken too much time and would not have been
compatible with the need to publish the tariff on August 1, 2008.54

68:

mn

However, there is nothing in the regulatory framework obliging the CNEE to publish
the tariff on the first day of the tariff period. Quite to the contrary, Article 99 of the
RLGE provides that the tariff is published once it has been approved and no later
than nine months after the beginning of the tariff period. As a consequence, the
CNEE had until May 1, 2009 at the latest to publish the new tariff. Meanwhile,
according to Article 99, the previous tariff could have remained in force with their
adjustment formulas.

68:

a

. According to Guatemala, the agreed delivery date for the Expert Commission’s
pronouncement was set for mid-July 2008, specifically July 18. The CNEE
subsequently agreed to extend such time limit “to the week of 24 July, 2008.”°" The
Expert Commission complied in the extended time limit. The regulator was aware of
the complexity of the issues raised and could not ignore that it would take more than
a few days to consider the Expert Commission’s conclusions and implement them in
the VAD study.

68

x

In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, in accepting that the Expert Commission would
deliver its report the week of July 24, 2008 (or even by mid July 2008), the CNEE
also had to accept that it would not be able to seriously consider the experts’
conclusions, correct the Bates White VAD study accordingly, and publish the tariff
by August 1, 2008.

68

*

By accepting to receive the Expert Commission’s report in the week of July 24,
2008, to then disregard it along with the Bates White study on the basis that such
date did not leave enough time to publish the tariff by August 1, 2008, the CNEE
acted in breach of the fundamental principles of due process as well as in a
contradictory and aberrant manner.
689. Respondent acknowledges that it only conducted a “preliminary review” of the
revised July 28 Bates White’s study and concluded that, because the models were not

linked and did not allow “quick verifications of the sources of efficient prices’, it
could not be amended “within the two remaining days.”**!

In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, both under the regulatory framework and under the
minimum standard of treatment, the CNEE could and should have taken the time,
after careful review of the Expert Commission’s report, to implement its conclusions
in the Bates White’s study. The “preliminary review” that the CNEE performed in
less than one day was clearly insufficient to discharge that obligation. The Arbitral

Tribunal can find no justification, other than its desire to reject the Bates White study

in favor of the more favorable Sigla’s study, for such a behavior.

. The arbitrariness of the regulator’s behavior is evidenced by the result of the

“preliminary review”

that it conducted over the weekend of 26-27 July of the
Expert Commission’s report and of its likely consequences on the May 5, 2008
version of the Bates White study.

The outcome of such review has been summarized in a document prepared by the
CNEE itself>?, where the regulator states its view that, if corrected in accordance
with the pronouncements of the Expert Commission, the May 5 Bates Whites study
would have led to a VNR of US$621 million (instead of the higher figure of
US$1,053 million proposed in the revised Bates Whites study). In the same
document, the CNEE mentions that the VNR proposed by Sigla, its own independent
consultant, was only US$451 million.>*

The Arbitral Tribunal draws two conclusions from such fact.

First, this preliminary review shows that the CNEE could, had it taken additional
time, have corrected the Bates Whites study according to the conclusions of the
Expert Commission.

Second, the regulator knew at the time that correcting the Bates White study would
have led to a higher VNR than the one proposed by Sigla.

Guatemala acknowledges that the Sigla report did not reflect the Expert
Commission’s pronouncements. Guatemala submits, in this respect, that the
Claimant’s position that the Sigla report was “unjustified from a financial and

engineering point of view [...] is based upon a fundamental error, which is to assume

55! Rejoinder, § 453.

that the Sigla study had to reflect the Expert Commission’s pronouncements”.
According to Guatemala “the Expert Commission was exclusively established for the
purpose of verifying whether Bates White had incorporated the comments made by
the CNEE into the tariff study so that it could comply with the Terms of
99555

Reference.

69

x

. The Arbitral Tribunal, however, has already explained why Guatemala’s view of the
role of the Expert Commission is incorrect.*°° The Expert Commission’s role was not
to verify that the distributor’s consultant had accepted all the regulator’s comments,
but to opine on whether such comments did comport with the regulatory framework
in case of disagreement.

698. As to Guatemala’s view that the regulator was at liberty to fix the tariff based on a
VAD study that did not reflect the Expert Commission’s pronouncements, it is also
incorrect. As a matter of fact, the regulatory framework only permits the CNEE to
apply its own unilateral VAD study in two limited circumstances, which did not
realize in the present case.°7

699. Guatemala also suggests that the difference between the VNR as proposed by Bates
White and corrected by the CNEE and its preliminary study of the Expert
Commission’s report (US$621 M vs. US$451M) can be explained by the fact that the
Expert Commission breached the Terms of Reference, in particular in respect of the
FRC. The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees.

701

S

First of all, if the regulator disagreed with the Expert Commission’s conclusions on
the depreciation, it should in good faith have expressed such disagreement in a
reasoned manner upon receipt of the Expert Commission’s report.

70

. Second, the Arbitral Tribunal has determined that the Terms of Reference did allow
the Expert Commission to depart from the Terms of Reference if needed to ensure
that the VAD report comport with the regulatory framework.*** This is what the
Expert Commission did in a reasoned manner in respect of the depreciation™”’. The
Arbitral Tribunal sees no valid reason to revisit the Expert Commission’s views in

this regard.

factors of less than 2, which are thus also not compliant with the formula established
in the Terms of Reference. Such facts show, in the Arbitral tribunal’s view, that a
depreciation factor of less than 2 cannot be inconsistent with the regulatory

»

Finally, Guatemala avers that Bates White’s 28 July study “failed to incorporate all
the pronouncements issued by the Expert Commission and produced overinflated
results."°°

704. As an initial matter, as said above™™, the regulator’s decision to reject the Bates
White study and apply the Sigla study was not based on an alleged failure by Bates
White to incorporate the Expert Commission’s pronouncements.

70:

nm

In addition, Guatemala’s contentions on such alleged failure is unconvincing.
Guatemala avers that the substantial difference between the VNR calculated by Mr.
Damonte and the one proposed by Bates White in the 28 July study shows that the
latter was overinflated. However, such difference can at least in part be explained by
the fact that the 28 July study applied the asset depreciation rate proposed by the
Expert Commission (i.e. 8.3 percent), while Mr. Damonte applied a higher rate of
29.6 percent”. Guatemala also avers that the 28 July study failed to incorporate all
the international reference prices required by the Expert Commission, and that
certain prices were excessive. However, as pointed out by the Claimant™”, the
study contains explanations in this respect, which the Respondent has not established

that there were unjustified or unreasonable. The Claimant also established that the 28

58 Mr. Damonte, in his rebuttal expert report (Report RER-5, § 382), also suggests that the depreciation applied by the
Expert Commission would include a “conceptual error” because it would lead to an IRR of 12.3 percent and 12.5 percent for
the next 30 and 25 years, i.e. significantly more than the one established by the regulatory framework. However, article 79
LGE provides for an IRR up to 13 percent. In addition, pursuant to article 79 LGE, the consequence of a higher IRR would
only be its reduction to the maximum amount permitted.

July study properly incorporated the Expert Commission’s finding with respect to
certain legal fees*,

706. Finally, Guatemala avers that “more information was needed” to correctly assess the
28 July study, which was still not an “auditable model” °° Again, no such complaint

was made by the regulator at the time. In addition, as said above>”.

, the regulator
could not in good faith expect the consultant to provide a perfect model in the few
days remaining before the starting date of the new tariff period. Furthermore, as it
appears, the Sigla study also had similar flaws*”', which did not prevent the regulator
from applying it.

707. In sum, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the CNEE decided to disregard the
consultant’s VAD study and apply its own unilateral VAD study when none of the
two circumstances permitting such a decision under RLGE Article 98 was present.

70:

oe

. The basis for the regulator’s decision is that the consultant had failed to incorporate
all the comments made by it in April 2008. Such basis is manifestly inconsistent with
the regulatory framework and amounts to ignoring without reasons the
pronouncements of the Expert Commission.

70!

©

Because the regulator did not consider the Expert Commission as a neutral advisory
body, but rather as the guardian of its own positions, the CNEE did not even consider
the Expert Commission’s pronouncements when fixing the tariff.

710. In doing so, the regulator has repudiated the two fundamental principles upon which
the regulatory framework bases the tariff review process: first that, save in the
limited cases provided in Article 98 RLGE, the tariff would be based on the VAD
study prepared by the distributor’s consultant; and, second, that any disagreement
between the regulator and the distributor regarding such VAD study would be
resolved by having regard to the pronouncements of a neutral Expert Commission.

71

. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that such repudiation of the two fundamental regulatory
principles applying to the tariff review process is arbitrary and breaches elementary
standards of due process in administrative matters. Such behavior therefore breaches
Guatemala’s obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment under article 10.5 of

CAFTA-DR. As shall be seen in subsequent sections of this award, the Arbitral

Tribunal finds that such breach has caused damages to the Claimant, in respect of

which the Claimant is entitled to compensation.

e) The alleged retaliation of Guatemala against EEGSA

712. In its first Memorial, Claimant alleged that after having unilaterally set the electricity
tariffs, the Respondent retaliated against the efforts of EEGSA to review the CNEE’s
decisions by (i) purporting to arrest senior managers of EEGSA on baseless charges,
and (ii) harassing the Manager of Planning, Control and Regulation of EEGSA, Mr.
Calleja, who had to leave the country”?

713. The Arbitral Tribunal, first of all, finds no evidence in the record that the arrest
warrants issued in August 2008 against the managers of Mr. Maté and Mr. Gomez
were such retaliatory measures. It rather appears that such arrest warrants were in
connection with an unrelated dispute between EEGSA and a private company who
filed the criminal charges. In addition, the warrants were subsequently suspended and
annulled by the Court of Appeals of Guatemala>”’.

714. As to the alleged harassment of Mr. Calleja, the Claimant submits that, after Mr.
Calleja made declarations on the radio about the disputed actions of the CNEE, his
car had been broken into and his laptop computer had been stolen. Claimant adds that
“the break-in appeared to be the work of professionals and had required someone to
follow him?™,

715. There is however no evidence that such events are attributable to the Respondent. As

a consequence, Claimant’s arguments in this respect are rejected.

IX. DAMAGES

716. The Claimant submits that it is entitled to two heads of damages. First of all, the
Claimant seeks recovery for its portion of the cash flow lost by EEGSA from August
2008 until October 2010 (such date being the date of EEGSA’s sale to EPM) as a
result of the application of a tariff based on the Sigla study (historical losses).
Second, the Claimant seeks to be compensated for the depressed value at which it

sold its shares in October 2010 (loss of value).

On the first head of claim, the Claimant seeks US$21,100,552. On the second head

. In support of its valuation, the Claimant relies on the expert evidence of Mr. Brent C.

Kaczmarek of Navigant Consulting.*”° The Respondent, on its side, relies on the
expert evidence of Mr. Mario C. Damonte>”, as well as of Messrs. Manuel A.
Abdala and Marcelo A. Schoeters.*”*

As an initial matter, both Parties agree on the methodology to be applied to both
heads of damages, i.e. the difference between an actual scenario (actual cash flows
during the historical period and EEGSA’s sale value to EPM) and a but for scenario
(cash flows that would have been received during the historical period and the higher
value to which EEGSA would have been sold to EPM in absence of breach).

The experts also agree on the DCF model to calculate the but for scenario, but

disagree on certain inputs.

. The Arbitral Tribunal will first (1) decide the points of disagreement between the

Parties as to the inputs in the DCF model. Based on its findings, it will then (2)
address the historical losses, and (3) the alleged loss of value in the sale to EPM.

Finally, the Arbitral tribunal will address (4) interest and (5) costs.
1. Valuation base and inputs

The Parties are essentially in disagreement on three important aspects of the but for
scenario: (b) the value of the VNR, (c) the proper FRC and (d) the level of capital
expenditures.

As an initial matter, the Arbitral Tribunal will decide the Parties’ disagreement on
whether the proper base of valuation should be the Bates White 5 May, 2008 report
as corrected by Mr. Damonte or the 28 July, 2008 report (a).

a) Valuation base

The first point of disagreement between the Parties is whether the but for scenario

should be calculated, as Claimant contends, on the basis of the July 28, 2008 version

57 Claimant PHB Reply, § 154.3; Report CER-5, §§ 135-141, Table 14. Claimant's expert, Mr. Kaczmarek revised the
calculation of damages according to some observations of Respondent's expert, (adjusting the VNR from 2006 to 2008 and
using the PPI instead of the CPI). This revision increased the valuation conclusions of Mr.Kaczmarek.

of the Bates White study or on the basis of the May 5, 2008 version of such study, as
corrected by Mr. Damonte based on the pronouncements of the Expert Commission.

72:

mn

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that there should not be any difference between one
or the other. In the Tribunal’s view, in order to be consistent with the regulatory
framework, the valuation base should be the May 5, 2008 study, as amended in order
to take into account the Expert Commission’s pronouncements, subject to, as the
case may be, any inconsistency between such pronouncements and the regulatory
framework to which the regulator could in good faith have objected to.

726. It is however undisputed that, in correcting the Bates White May 2008 study, Mr.
Damonte disregarded the Expert Commission pronouncements at least on one
important question, i.e. the FRC.°” The Arbitral Tribunal, in earlier sections of this
award”*?, has already decided that there is no reason to depart from the Expert
Commission’s pronouncement on this question. The Expert Commission’s
pronouncement on the FRC is in fact consistent with the regulatory framework and
the regulator would have had no valid reason to object to it.

72

x

Because the May 2008 study as corrected by Mr. Damonte departs from the Expert
Commission’s pronouncement on this important question, the Arbitral Tribunal
cannot usefully refer to it as a basis for assessing the but for scenario.

728. As a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal will work on the basis of the July 28, 2008
version of the study, and assess whether Respondent's criticism to such study and the
resulting but for scenario are reasonable on each of the three main areas of
disagreement. The Tribunal considers that this approach will allow calculation of
damages with a sufficient degree of certainty based on what the tariffs should have

been had the CNEE complied with the regulatory framework.

b) The VNR

72

©

Essentially, the Claimant bases its but for scenario on an asset base of the company
(VNR) of US$1,102 million as established in the Bates White 28 July study, while
the Respondent adopts the lower figure of US$629 million proposed by Mr.

Damonte.

58 See above, §§ 699-702.

141

730. According to Messrs. Abdala and Schoeter™*!, the VNR proposed in the 28 July
study is artificially high and does not incorporate all the corrections proposed by the
Expert Commission. Mr. Damonte’s evidence is to the same effect™”. Mr.
Kaczmarek, to the contrary, opines that the VNR in force in 2008 (at the end of the
previous tariff period) was US$744.2 million, and that a deduction of more than
US$80 million on the VNR would not make sense***,

73

. After careful review of the evidence, the Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced that the
Bates White 28 July study failed to incorporate the Expert Commission’s
pronouncements or that there is any reason to depart from such pronouncements. The
Respondent did not establish, other than by noting that there is an important
difference between the accounting asset base and the regulatory asset base, that Bates
White failed to properly incorporate the Expert Commission’s pronouncements in its
28 July study. The Respondent however accepts that the regulatory framework is not
based on the accounting asset base and that the regulatory base can be different. Nor
did the Respondent establish that the regulator would have had any valid reasons to
disregard the pronouncements of the Expert Commission regarding the asset base.

732. As a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal will accept the VNR proposed by Mr.

Kaczmarek.

c) The FRC

73:

»

The difference between the Parties on the FRC is that the July 28 Bates White’s
study is based, as proposed by the Expert Commission, on an FRC which
incorporates a lower rate of amortization (i.e. 1,09), thus leading to a higher VAD,
while Mr. Damonte corrected the Bates White May 5 study on the basis of a higher
factor of amortization (i.e. 1,42), which effect is thus to lower the VAD**4,

734. The reason for this is that, according to the Respondent, “the scheme proposed by the

EC overcompensates the investor**

and is inconsistent with Bates White’s Terms
of Reference.

73:

um

The Arbitral Tribunal has however already decided**” that the decision of the Expert

Commission on the FRC is reasonable and consistent with the regulatory framework.

The Arbitral Tribunal has further decided that the regulator would have had no valid

Kaczmarek.

d) Capital expenditures

73)

x

The Parties are in disagreement on the proper level of capital expenditure of EEGSA.
Respondent avers that “Mr Kazmarek’s model projects investments far below the
needs of the company (US$46.2 million per year). More importantly still, the
projections are lower than those included in the Bates White model (US$76.5
million).”**°

738. The Claimant avers that, at the hearing, Respondent’s experts Mssrs. Abdala and
Schoeters acknowledged that, because Mr. Kaczmarek corrected its but for
investments, “there are no longer any significant differences between the parties as

to the amount of investments EEGSA would have made.”*”°

739. However, Mr. Abdala explained at the hearing™”!

that his statement was premised on
the adoption of the lower VNR as proposed by Mr. Damonte, whereas the higher
asset base proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek would necessary warrant a higher level of
capital expenditures.

740. The Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced that an increase of the regulatory asset base
entails a proportional increase of the capital expenditures. It is in fact undisputed that

the regulatory asset base may differ from the actual asset base*”

. In addition, as
noted by the Claimant®”’, the amount of capital expenditures proposed by Mr.
Kaczmarek is twice as high as EEGSA’s historical capital expenditures, which the
Arbitral Tribunal finds reasonable.

741. Based on the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal accepts the capital expenditures

proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek.

2. Historical losses

742. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that Respondent’s breach caused losses to the
Claimant. Such damages amount to the (i) Claimant’s share of the higher revenues
that EEGSA would have received had the CNEE observed due process in the tariff
review, (ii) to run from the moment the high revenues would have been first received
until the moment when the Claimant sold its share in EEGSA. The amount of such
losses must be quantified in the “but for” scenario discussed by the Parties, on the
basis of what the tariffs should have been had the CNEE complied with the
regulatory framework. As said in § 728 above, such assessment is properly made on
the basis of the Bates White’s July 28, 2008 study. The Arbitral Tribunal has
accepted the Claimant’s views on the three issues that are in dispute in respect of that
study (i.e. the VNR, the FRC and the CAPEX). As a consequence, the Arbitral

Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s claim for its historical losses of US$21,100,552.
3. Loss of value

14

oe

. On October 21, 2010, DECA II (the holding company of EEGSA) was sold to EPM.
744. The Claimant avers that the decision to sell EEGSA was driven by the substantial
losses suffered by the company as a consequence of the imposition of a low tariff

based on the Sigla study

, and that the sale price to EPM was substantially lowered
as a consequence of such situation.’ The Claimant seeks US$222,484,783
corresponding to its share of the lost value in the sale to EPM.*”°

745. The Claimant relies, in its submissions that it decided to sell DECA II as a
consequence of the CNEE’s arbitrary actions, in the board of directors’ meeting of
EEGSA held on October 14, 2010.°°”

746. Respondent, on the contrary, submits that the minutes of such board of directors’
meeting were prepared after Teco had sent its notice of intent on January 9, 2009 and
before this arbitration started, and therefore that they took into account the arguments

598

that Teco would make in this arbitration.””” Moreover, the Respondent asserts that

the fact that Teco did not try to sell its ownership stake for more than two years after

the measures of the CNEE, and that it proceeded to sell only at the suggestion of its

partner Iberdrola®”

is sufficient to prove that the sale was not motivated by the
CNEE’s measures but responded exclusively to corporate policies that had nothing to
do with EEGSA’s tariff review process in 2008.%°

747. The minutes of the October 14, 2010 board of directors’ meeting of EEGSA state the
following: “The proposed sale provides us with an opportunity to exit a minority
position in a business where we perceive risk to have meaningfully increased. As
discussed at previous Board meetings, the Guatemalan government regulator, acting
outside the process prescribed in the Guatemalan electricity law, imposed a
significant reduction of the tariff rate for distribution (VAD) on EEGSA in its rate
case in August 2008, the subject of the CAFTA claim discussed below. We believe
there is continued risk of government interference in EEGSA business.”

748. The Arbitral Tribunal has no reasons to doubt that, as reflected in the minutes, the
decision to divest was taken primarily as a consequence of the breach by the CNEE
of the regulatory framework. It is certainly true that, as pointed out by the
Respondent, the tariff had been into force for two years at that time. However,
judicial proceedings had been pending before the Guatemalan courts until 2010 and
it is understandable that Teco waited until then to take a decision to divest. It is also
true that other considerations might have come into play, such as Iberdrola's own
business decisions. However, this does not alter the fact that the breach by the CNEE
of the regulatory framework has played an important role in Teco's decision to
divest.

749. Nevertheless, as will be seen in further sections of this award, the Arbitral Tribunal
finds no sufficient evidence of the existence and quantum of the losses that were
allegedly suffered as a consequence of the sale.

750. It is undisputed that DECA II was sold to EPM for US$605 million. The Parties are
in slight disagreement on the share of the price that is attributed to EEGSA.

According to Mr. Kaczmarek, such share is US$562.4 million”, while Messrs.

Abdala and Schoeters submit that EEGSA’s value in the sale was between US$518
million and US$582 million™.

751. The Parties nevertheless differ substantially as to EEGSA’s but for value. The
Claimant asserts a value of US$1,479.3 million™, while the Respondent proposes a
value of US$594.9 million.

752. The Arbitral Tribunal accepts that the existing tariffs were taken into account in
fixing the price of the transaction.

753. In an interview to the press on October 23, 2010, the CEO of EPM Mr. Federico

»

Restrepo made the following statements: “Q. The shareholders argued that there
would be lower revenue and profitability due to the VAD. Despite this issue, you
decided to buy? A. This is reflected in the value of the transaction. We bought on the
basis that the current tariff model and layout is the one that exists. Clearly it has an
impact on the final valuation and we had no expectation that it would be modified or
changed. Q. You must start preparing for the VAD of the next five year period. Do
you think it can improve with respect to the current one? A. Our valuation process of
the company included various scenarios one of them being that the VAD — value
received by distributors for the service — would not be modified. This is what we
studied. Q. when you mention the valuation process, does it mean that the company
would have costed more with another VAD? A. That is possible. For the same cost
you receive more revenue, you have more cash of course.”°°
75.

aa

Such statements show that the existing tariff were considered as a relevant factor in
determining the price of the transaction. There is however no sufficient evidence
that, had the 2008-2013 tariffs been higher, the transaction price would have
reflected the higher revenues of the company until 2013. The interview of Mr.
Restrepo only mentions as a “possibility” that with a higher VAD for the rest of the

tariff period, the transaction price would have been higher. And there no evidence in

the record of how the transaction price has been determined. The Arbitral Tribunal
therefore ignores what other factors might have come into play and cannot conclude
with sufficient certainty that an increase in revenues until 2013 would have been
reflected in the purchase price and to what extent.

The Arbitral Tribunal also finds no evidence that, as submitted by the Claimant, the
valuation of the company reflected the assumption that the tariffs would remain

unchanged beyond 2013 and forever.

. In fact, while Mr. Restrepo says in his interview that the purchaser assumed that the

tariffs were likely to remain the same for future tariff periods, he also says that such a

scenario was only one of those which were considered by the purchaser.

. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the claim is in this respect

speculative.°” The Respondent rightly points out that “it is actually impossible to
know what will happen with the tariffs in the future.”

The regulatory framework permits EEGSA to seek adjustments of the tariffs, and the
VAD is recalculated every 5 years. As a consequence, there was nothing preventing
the distributor from seeking an increase of the tariffs at the end of the 2008-2013
tariff period. In this respect, no information has been provided to the Arbitral
Tribunal regarding the establishment of the 2013-2018 tariffs. Likewise, there is no
indication that the distributor will be prevented from seeking a change in the tariffs
in 2018.

Finally, the regulatory framework may change, with consequences on future tariff
review processes as well as on the future level of the VAD.

As a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot accept that the sale price to EPM was

based on the assumption that tariffs would remain forever unchanged post-2013.

. As a consequence of the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal will reject the claim for loss

of value.

4. Interest

 

The Claimant seeks simple and compounded interest at the rate of 8.8 percent from
August 1“, 2008 (first day of the 2008-2013 tariff period) until full payment. The 8.8

percent interest rate corresponds to EEGSA’s WACC in October 2010.6"

The Respondent does not object to the request for pre-award interest. The
Respondent also does not object to the claim for compounded interest.

In Respondent’s submission, however, the pre-award interest “must be adjusted to
the WACC in effect before the TGH sale (since TGH even assumed an operating risk)
and from 21 October onwards using an adjustment factor based on a risk-free rate,
such as (for example) US 10-Year government bonds. On average, these bonds
produced a yield of 3.3 percent during the period of August 2008-October 2010 and
2.8 during October 2010-December 2011.”°'°

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that interest should only accrue from the date of the
sale of EEGSA to EPM in October 2010. As a matter of fact, because the
US$21,100,552 historical losses damages correspond to revenues that would have
progressively flowed into EEGSA from August 2008 until October 2010, and
because such amount has not been discounted to August 2008%', calculating interest
on the entire amount of the historical damages as from the first day of the tariff
period would result in an unjust enrichment of the Claimant. As a consequence,
interest shall only accrue from October 21, 2010.

The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that applying EEGSA’s WACC
post-October 2010 would not make sense since the Claimant had sold its interest in
EEGSA and ceased to assume the company’s operating risks. The Arbitral Tribunal
thus agrees with the Respondent that a risk-free rate should be applied.

Because the loss suffered by the Claimant corresponds to the cost of borrowing
money in the United States, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Mr. Kaczmarek’s

evidence®*

that the proper interest should be based on the US Prime rate of interest
plus a 2 percent premium in order to reflect a rate that is broadly available to the
market.

As a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the damages granted to the
Claimant will bear pre and post-award interest at the US Prime rate of interest plus a
2 percent premium from October 21, 2010 until full payment. Such interest shall be

compounded on an annual basis.

The Costs

769. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that “the Tribunal shall, except as

the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection
with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees
and the expenses of the members of the tribunal and the charges for the use of the

facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.”

770. Rule 28 of the Arbitration Rules provides that “(/) Without prejudice to the final

decision on the payment of the cost of the proceeding, the Tribunal may, unless
otherwise agreed by the parties, decide:

(a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party shall pay, pursuant
to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the fees and expenses of the
Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre;

(b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as determined
by the Secretary-General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of

the parties.”

771. Rule 47(1)G) of the Arbitration Rules also provides that the award should contain

“any decision of the Tribunal regarding the costs of the proceeding”.

772. According to the timetable agreed by the Parties, each party presented its

submissions on costs on July 24, 2013, and reply to submissions on costs on August
7, 2013. The Respondent submitted an updated claim for expenses on November 18,

2013, to take into account the payment of the third advance of fees and costs.

773. The Claimant submits that it incurred the following fees and expenses:

e Legal fees and expenses: US$6,327,903.29

e Expert and consultant fees and expenses: US$2,932,603.33
e Arbitration expenses of TECO: US$17,087.24

e ICSID costs: US$750,000

Total of incurred costs: US$10,027,593.86

774. The Respondent submitted that it incurred the following fees and expenses:

e ICSID costs: US$725,000.00 (reflecting the Respondent’s payment of
US$250,000.00 as requested in the Secretary’s letter of August 7, 2013,

and confirmed by the Respondent in its letter of November 18, 2013).

Total of incurred costs: US$5,250,047.43

. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that such costs are justified and appropriate in view of

the complexity of this case.

Each party requested that the other be ordered to support the entirely of its costs and
expenses. Both parties submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal should apply the principle
that costs follow the event®. Both parties also agree that, in assessing and

apportioning the costs, the Arbitral Tribunal can exercise discretion®"*,

. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the costs should be apportioned

based on the principle the costs follow the event.

The Claimant has been successful in its arguments regarding jurisdiction, as well as
in establishing the Respondent’s responsibility. However, the Respondent has been
partially successful on quantum.

Based on the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that the Respondent will
support the entirety of its costs and reimburse 75 percent of the costs supported by

the Claimant, i.e.: US$7,520,695.39
