I.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

This Decision addresses Tethyan Copper Company Pty Limited’s (“Claimant” or
“TCCA”) application for the termination of the stay of enforcement of the ICSID award
rendered on 12 July 2019 (the “Award”) by the arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal’”) in
Tethyan Copper Company Pty Limited v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan (ICSID Case No.
ARB/12/1) (the “Arbitration”).

On 8 November 2019, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan “Applicant” or “Pakistan”)
submitted an Application for the Annulment of the Award (“Annulment Application”).
In its Annulment Application, Pakistan requested, among other things, a provisional stay

of enforcement of the Award in accordance with Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention.

On 18 November 2019, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 50(2)(a)-(c), the
Secretary-General registered the Annulment Application and informed the parties of the

provisional stay of enforcement of the Award.

On 11 February 2020, TCCA filed a request to terminate the stay of enforcement of the
Award (“Cl. Opposition”).

On 12 February 2020, Pakistan requested that ICSID only transmit the transmittal cover
email of TCCA’s filing of 11 February 2020, as opposed to the “actual submission”, to the

ad hoc committee, once constituted.

On 14 February 2020, TCCA replied to Pakistan’s 12 February 2020 letter, stating that
“ICSID has no authority to prevent the Parties from communicating with the ad hoc

Committee”.

By email of 18 February 2020, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the parties’
communications of 11, 12, and 14 February 2020 and informed the parties that, “[p]ursuant
to ICSID Arbitration Rules 30 and 53, as soon as the Committee is constituted, the
Secretariat shall transmit to each member a copy of the Annulment Application, of its
supporting documentation, of the Notice of Registration and of any communication

received from either party in response thereto”.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1) — Annulment Proceeding

 

On 25 March 2020, in accordance with Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention, the
Secretary-General notified the parties that an ad hoc Committee appointed by the Chair of
the Administrative Council had been constituted, composed of Prof. Joongi Kim (from the
Republic of Korea), as President; Judge Bernardo Septlveda-Amor (from the United
Mexican States); and Ms. Carita Wallgren-Lindholm (from the Republic of Finland) (the
“Committee”). Prof. Kim, Judge Sepulveda-Amor, and Ms. Wallgren-Lindholm are
members of the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, appointed by Korea, Mexico, and Finland,

respectively.

On 25 March 2020, TCCA wrote to the Committee proposing a pleading schedule with

regard to the question of the stay of enforcement of the Award.
On 30 March 2020, Pakistan replied to TCCA’s letter of 25 March 2020.

On 2 April 2020, the Committee fixed a schedule for the parties’ further submissions on
the stay of enforcement of the Award. The Committee also invited the parties to consider
several dates for a First Session as well as the possibility of holding a hearing on the stay

of enforcement of the Award.

In accordance with the schedule, on 8 April 2020, Pakistan filed additional observations to

TCCA’s request to terminate the stay of enforcement of the award (“Applicant’s Reply”).

On 14 April 2020, TCCA filed a response to Pakistan’s observations on the request to

terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award (“Cl. Rejoinder”).

On 17 April 2020, Pakistan filed a reply to TCCA’s response of 14 April 2020
(“Applicant’s Response”).

On 23 April 2020, the Committee confirmed the schedule for the First Session and Hearing
on Stay of Enforcement of the Award (“Hearing”), instructed the parties on the manner of
proceeding during the First Session and Hearing, and directed the parties as to the
procedure for exchanging any demonstratives they would use during the First Session and

Hearing.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1) — Annulment Proceeding

 

On 27 April 2020, TCCA filed a request to: (i) rely on certain documents from the

underlying arbitral record during the Hearing, which had not been cited in the parties’

annulment submissions; and (ii) to admit new evidence into the record [i.e. Exhibits

CEA-084 and CEA-085].

After exchanges from the parties on the matter, the Committee decided on 28 April 2020,

to grant TCCA’s request, as follows:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

iv)

TCCA shall identify the exact paragraphs in CEA-084 and CEA-085 that it wishes

to cite;

Following the Hearing, Pakistan will be given an opportunity to file responsive
evidence, addressing the new evidence and those points on which TCCA relies in

each document;

Pakistan's responsive evidence should identify the paragraph number(s) of each
document relevant to address points raised by TCCA. If Pakistan chooses to file a
further witness statement, it can only be from Mr. Kamran Ali Afzal and will be

limited to the new issues raised by TCCA through its additional evidence;

Should Pakistan decide to use this opportunity, it should do so by close of business

Tuesday, 5 May 2020.

18. On 28 April 2020, TCCA provided the specific citations of the portions of Exhibits
CEA-084 and CEA-085 on which it would rely during the Hearing. The parties also

submitted their respective Power Point Presentations to be used during the Hearing.

On 29 April 2020, the Committee held its First Session and Hearing with the parties via

Webex videoconference. Participating in the First Session and Hearing were:

further observations that they may have on their respective applications of 6 and 9 May
2020. Pakistan submitted its observations on 13 May 2020 and counsel for TCCA
submitted theirs on 21 May 2020.

On 13 May 2020, Pakistan submitted observations on the undertaking proposed by TCCA

during the Hearing.

On 18 and 19 May 2020, Pakistan and TCCA, respectively, submitted various comments

on the transcripts of the First Session and Hearing.
By letter dated 21 May 2020, TCCA submitted its observations on Pakistan’s undertaking.

By email dated 29 May 2020, the Committee informed the parties that, having been at the
Hearing and having reviewed the audio recordings, it deemed it would be better served to
exercise judicial economy and that it was unnecessary to engage in the time and cost to

amend the transcripts, particularly based upon the proposed changes.

By email of 31 May 2020, letter of 3 June 2020, and email of 4 June 2020, TCCA, Pakistan,
and TCCA, respectively, submitted observations on whether five expert reports that
Pakistan filed with its Annulment Application should be admitted into the annulment
proceedings and for consideration in the stay decision. In its 31 May 2020 email, TCCA
stated that it was prepared to consent to the admission of the reports for purposes of the

stay.

Following TCCA’s 12 June 2020 follow-up email, on 15 June 2020, the Committee made

a decision to strike certain portions of Mr. Afzal’s Second Witness Statement.

The Committee has extensively deliberated, by videoconferencing and other means, on
numerous occasions over the period between its constitution and the issuance of this

Decision.

II. THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES

33.

34.

Applicant requests the Committee to continue the provisional stay of enforcement of the
Award until it decides on Applicant’s request for annulment.! It argues that there is a
tendency of ad hoc committees to continue the stay of enforcement which, by no means, is
an exceptional remedy.” In any case, Applicant argues that it has met the burden of proof
of demonstrating the existence of circumstances that warrant the continuation of the

provisional stay.*

Claimant requests the Committee to reject Applicant’s petition and lift the provisional stay
of enforcement of the Award.’ It argues that Applicant has the burden of demonstrating the
existence of specific circumstances that would warrant the continuation of the stay, a
burden that has not been met by Applicant.° In the alternative, if the Committee considers
that such burden was met, Claimant requests the Committee to subject the continuation of

the stay to the provision by Applicant of a security.°

A. THE STANDARD FOR GRANTING A STAY OF ENFORCEMENT

35.

a. Applicant’s Position

Applicant argues that the analysis should begin with the key provisions, namely
Articles 52(5) and 53(1) of the ICSID Convention and Rules 54(2) and 54(4) of the
Arbitration Rules, which shall be interpreted in accordance with Articles 31 through 33 of
the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“Vienna Convention” or “VCLT”).’ For
Applicant, such interpretation demonstrates, contrary to what Claimant affirmed, that

granting the continuation of the stay is not the exception.*

(ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1) — Annulment Proceeding

36. Accordingly, Applicant argues that these provisions shall be interpreted in accordance with:
(1) “the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty”;? (2) “in their context”; !°

(3) “in the light of its object and purpose”;!! and (4) “tak[ing] into account ‘any relevant

oo 12

tules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties

37. First, pursuant to the ordinary meaning of Article 52(5), it is within the “broad discretion”
of the Committee to continue the provisional stay. Thus, contrary to Claimant’s assertion,

there is neither a presumption in favour nor against the stay.'*

38. Further, these provisions do not qualify the circumstances that may warrant the
continuation of the stay and do not establish the weight that the Committee must give to
such circumstances. '* Thus, contrary to Claimant’s assertion and as recognized by other

ad hoc committees, there is no indication in these provisions that the circumstances need

to be “exceptional” or “extraordinary”. '*

39. Second, regarding the context, Applicant first argues that the ICSID Convention confers
upon parties the legal right to seek annulment of an award and to have an ad hoc committee

decide on such request, which is a central feature of the system.'° Within this framework,

Article 52(5) confers an auxiliary right to request the stay of enforcement while the request
for annulment is decided.'” In this context, for Applicant, it is “unsurprising” that if and
when an annulment is legitimately sought in good faith, the deciding ad hoc committee

should order the continuation of the stay of enforcement. '*

40. Applicant further argues that Article 52(5) is part of Section 5 of Chapter IV of the ICSID
Convention on “Interpretation, Revision and Annulment of the Award”. By contrast,
Articles 53-54 of the Convention, which relate to the binding effect of an award and its
enforcement, are part of the subsequent section (i.e. Section 6 of Chapter IV).'° For
Applicant, this suggests that when used, “annulment is a process that naturally precedes

enforcement”, especially given that annulment takes place within the ICSID framework

whereas recognition and enforcement takes place outside it.?°

41. Finally, Applicant rejects the existence of a presumption against the stay of enforcement,
as argued by Claimant.?! For Applicant, the final and binding nature is subject to the
exercise of the rights conferred by Article 52 of the Convention, including the right to
request the stay of enforcement,”? something that Claimant has failed to address.” Such
position, according to Applicant, is supported by the “long-standing practice of committees

toward ordering a stay”, demonstrated by the fact that out of 59 publicly available stay

applications, 45 were granted and 14 were denied,** which is “indicative of a certain line

of jurisprudential consistency”.”>

42. Third, Applicant argues that pursuant to the ICSID Convention’s preamble, Article 52(5)
has to be interpreted “in light of the ‘need for international cooperation for economic

development [...]’”, 7°

1.27

and taking into account the importance given to the parties’
consent.*’ Therefore, an interpretation of the Convention that creates “unnecessary or
precipitate impairment of the economic development of ICSID States would be contrary to
[said] objective.”?* Accordingly, the Convention’s objective and purposes would not be
properly served with the immediate enforcement of an award that would have devastating

consequences on a developing country.”

43. Fourth, Applicant argues that based upon Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, Article 6(1) of the
International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (“ICCPR”) must also be taken into
account. Ratified by almost all ICSID Contracting States, ICCPR enshrines through Article
6(1) the right to life and the prohibition of the arbitrary deprivation of life, which is also a
customary international norm.*° Accordingly, “any circumstance of jeopardy to the right
to life of individuals would be one requiring a stay.”*! Similarly, Applicant argues that
Article 13(1) of the World Health Organization’s (“WHO”) International Health
Regulations 2005 must be taken into account. This Article stipulates that each State must
“develop, strengthen and maintain...the capacity to respond promptly and effectively to

public health risks and public health emergencies of international concern”. ** As a

contracting party to the Regulations, immediate enforcement of the Award would hinder

Pakistan’s performance of this obligation.

44. Based on the aforementioned, Applicant argues that, as correctly accepted by Claimant, the
Committee’s task “is to consider all the individual circumstances of the particular case
before it and decide, in the exercise of its discretion, whether the continuation of the

provisional stay is required”.*?

45. Although Applicant rejects that the standard of proof for the continuation of the stay is to
demonstrate that the circumstances are “exceptional”, it argues that even if that was the
standard, as explained infra, such standard is met.** Applicant further argues that
Claimant’s argument that something additional to the ordinary consequences of complying
with an award is required should be approached with caution.*> Such consequences are part
of the case’s individual circumstances, which shall be taken into account by the Committee,

and which may warrant the continuation of the stay in the particular case.*°

b. Claimant’s Position

46. Claimant rejects the position adopted by Applicant and argues that a continued stay of
enforcement “is the exception and not the rule” whereas lifting the provisional stay of

enforcement is the default rule.*’ This position is supported by the following arguments:

47. First, for Claimant, Applicant’s reading of the ICSID Convention violates the fundamental

tenets of treaty interpretation.** Under such an interpretation, any award debtor that seeks

annulment “would be assured of an extended stay of enforcement for the entire duration of
the annulment proceedings”, which is contrary to the intent of the provisions.*? Claimant

does not address Applicant’s arguments based on ICCPR or the WHO regulations.

48. In this sense, previous ad hoc committees have recognized that there is no presumption
that an applicant is entitled to or has the right to a continued stay.*° In fact, because the
Committee has to perform an enquiry based on the specific facts of a case, the fact that

there may be a trend of ad hoc committees towards ordering the stay is irrelevant.*!

49. Second, based on the wording of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, a party’s wishes
are not enough and the circumstances of the case at hand must “require” the continuation
of the stay.* Thus, filing a request for the annulment of an award, in itself, does not warrant
an extended stay of enforcement and such petition does not have a suspensive effect on the

enforcement of the award."

50. Similarly, Rule 54(2) states that the provisional stay instituted upon the annulment request
“shall automatically be terminated” if it is not affirmatively decided by the ad hoc

committee that the stay shall continue.

51. Third, Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention gives broad discretion to the Committee to

adopt its decision, including the power to terminate the stay of enforcement where the

annulment application is meritless or is manifestly dilatory.** Such discretion, however,
does not excuse Applicant from its burden of demonstrating the circumstances that require

the stay.*°

52. Fourth, based on the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention, awards are final and
binding once they are issued and are subject to the very limited avenues for challenge

expressly enshrined in the Convention.*”

53. Based on the aforementioned, Claimant argues that Applicant bears a high burden of proof
that requires it to furnish evidence of the specific and exceptional circumstances that would
“justify preventing a successful claimant from enforcing a final and binding ICSID

award”.** For Claimant, as explained infra, Applicant has failed to meet this burden. *?

54. Finally, Claimant points out that Applicant relies on several expert reports submitted with
its request for annulment. For Claimant, the introduction of such reports was made without
leave from the Committee and it is unclear that such reports are admissible. In any case,
even if treated as part of the record, Claimant argues that Applicant still fails to meet its

burden.*°

B. THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE CONTINUANCE OF THE STAY

55. For Applicant, the following circumstances warrant the continuation of the provisional stay
of enforcement of the Award:*! (1) whether the request for stay was made in good faith;
(2) prejudice to Applicant if the provisional stay is not continued; (3) prejudice to Claimant
if the provisional stay is continued; (4) the lack of risk of non-compliance with the Award
should the Award not be annulled; and (5) the risk of non-recoupment of the monies paid

should the Award be annulled.

56. Claimant argues that Applicant has failed to establish any valid grounds for continuing the
stay for the following reasons: (1) Pakistan has not demonstrated “the kind of acute,
particularized harm that satisfies the demanding standard imposed under the ICSID
Convention and Rules”;*? (2) a continuation of the stay would impose greater and
unjustified burdens on Claimant; (3) the risk of non-compliance with the Award; and,
(4) the lack of risk of non-recoupment. Thus, it requests the Committee to terminate the

provisional stay of enforcement of the Award.**

(1) Whether the Request for Stay was Made in Good Faith
a. Applicant’s Position

57. Applicant argues that enforcing an award with potentially devastating consequences on a
developing country, when the request for stay is made in good faith, does not serve the
object and purposes of the ICSID Convention.** Applicant affirms that it has raised serious
grounds in its request for stay and, therefore, filing such a request is not a dilatory tactic
which, in turn, supports the continuation of the stay of enforcement.* In any case, the

Committee cannot assume that the Award will not be annulled.*°

(ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1) — Annulment Proceeding

 

58. Applicant clarifies that there is no need for the Committee to consider the merits of its
annulment request as part of the Committee’s analysis of the circumstances requiring the

continuation of the stay.*”

b. Claimant’s Position

59. Pakistan’s stay request is merely its latest tactic to hinder and obstruct TCCA’s efforts to
enforce its right to compensation. It is yet another attempt to put off paying the price for
its breaches of the Australia-Pakistan bilateral investment treaty. An ad hoc committee
does have the discretion to reject a stay request made in a manifestly dilatory or abusive
annulment application, even if the circumstances would otherwise support it. A claim that
an application was submitted in good faith is not a circumstance justifying a stay of
enforcement because “a serious good faith application is the least that can be expected from
an applicant, and nothing in the ICSID Convention expresses, or allows an understanding,
that compliance with or fulfillment of that minimum duty requires the extension of the

stay.”°8

60. For Claimant, the supposed merits of the Annulment Application are irrelevant for the
decision on the continuation of the stay.* If the continuation of the stay was tied to the
annulment applicant’s merits, ad hoc committees would be at risk of prejudging the
annulment applications in their decisions on the stay of enforcement. In any case, the
grounds cited by Applicant are baseless and the Annulment Application and stay request
are nothing more than a tactic to abuse ICSID procedural mechanisms and hinder the

efforts of Claimant to obtain effective relief.°!

(2) Prejudice to Applicant if the Stay is Not Continued
a. Applicant’s Position

61. For Applicant, ad hoc committees normally consider the economic harm that the parties
may suffer from the “immediate” enforcement of an award. Accordingly, it maintains
that where ad hoc committees have found hardship to exist, they have ordered the
continuation of the stay without the need for security from the award debtor.® This,
however, does not impose the burden on the requesting party to show “that [failing
continuation] there will be a financial catastrophe or irreparable prejudice” in the ability of

the State to conduct its affairs.“

62. Applicant argues that the Award is the second largest ICSID award in existence,
representing over 50% of Pakistan’s official foreign exchange reserves.®° As such, its
immediate enforcement would have immediate and potentially devastating effects on
Pakistan’s fragile economy and social and political situation, all of which warrant the
provisional stay to be continued.” In particular, Applicant highlights the effects described

infra.’

63. First, immediate enforcement would “‘require the abandonment’ of Pakistan’s ongoing

critical economic reforms” that have helped preserve economic stability.%* Abandoning
such reforms would very likely derail the USD 6 billion loan package provided by the IMF

to support such economic reforms, since Pakistan would be unable to comply with the

conditions set therein. °° Further, it would likely “lead to withdrawal of the international
financing support that has been pledged to Pakistan contingent on the implementation of

the IMF package”.”°

64. Second, immediate enforcement of the Award would be felt across the State’s economy
and would require the reallocation of the available public funds, including the removal of
funding “devoted to health and welfare spending in Pakistan”.”! This, according to
Applicant, would have disastrous effects on the State’s capacity to meet public needs,
including the loss of life and the impact on programs designed to face the crisis of the
COVID-19 pandemic, all of which would affect specially the most vulnerable segment of

the population.”

65. Third, as required by the IMF, Pakistan has implemented “tough austerity measures” that
have led to “large-scale anti-government protests”.’? Because immediate enforcement of
the Award would undermine the justification for such austerity measures, enforcement

would trigger more strikes and protests and, therefore, would threaten social stability.”

66. Fourth, “(lifting the stay will likely have particularly serious economic, social and
security impacts on the people of Balochistan”, the most economically, politically and

socially disadvantaged area in Pakistan.”

67. Fifth, immediate payment of the Award would impact Applicant’s ability to respond to
security threats.”° These include its efforts to eradicate the presence of terrorists in the
Federally Administered Tribal Areas,’’ to ensure control in its Western border with
Afghanistan pursuant to its international obligations of suppression of terrorism,’* and to

address particular problems regarding the financing of terrorism and money laundering.”

time. It argues that this has never been a relevant factor considered by ad hoc committees,

72.

Accordingly, it affirms “that the Committee cannot assess how various enforcement
jurisdictions will handle the proceedings before it, and cannot speculate thereon when

deciding whether circumstances exist requiring a stay”.*”

For Applicant, continuing the stay of enforcement would reduce these adverse effects
because this would: (1) give it more time to plan how to minimize the risk posed by the
payment of the Award; (2) allow for a more gradual and careful relocation of funds; and,

(3) allow enforcement to take place when Pakistan is in a better socio-economic position.**

Applicant denies that, as argued by Claimant, it is ready to monetize the value of Reko Diq
and, thus, that the economic hardship would be offset because of the size of the asset.**
Applicant argues that doing so is a lengthy process for which it is not ready. It affirms that
it “still does not have unrestricted access to the project core samples and associated data
that were generated by [Claimant] over the course of its several years on the site” and that
“the core shed remains in [Claimant’s] control”, which make any transition from a non-
producing to a producing asset much more difficult.*> Applicant further highlights that it
was unreasonable for it to be expected to exploit the asset during the pendency of the case

brought by Claimant.*°

Finally, Applicant argues that it is incorrect that the ad hoc committee in Karkey v. Pakistan
rejected similar arguments as those presented in the case at hand. For Applicant, the amount
owed under the Karkey v. Pakistan award was of a different magnitude and the situation
that it is now facing is materially different from the one it was facing after the Karkey v.

Pakistan award.*”

b. Claimant’s Position

73. Claimant argues that allowing TCCA to proceed with the enforcement does not create an

undue prejudice to Pakistan.** This is based on the arguments described infra.

74. First, Claimant argues that Applicant’s position is based solely on the size of the Award.
On the one hand, as recognized by previous ad hoc committees, budgetary consequences
arising from the payment of any award cannot serve as a basis to delay its enforcement.*®
Continuing the stay of enforcement based on the budgetary consequences for the State
cannot be reconciled with a State’s voluntarily assumed obligations to comply with an
ICSID award in accordance with Articles 52(5) and 53(1) of the ICSID Convention and
Arbitration Rule 54(1).°°

75. On the other hand, the size of the Award reflects the extraordinary value of the asset that
was expropriated by Applicant and the scope of its misconduct. Accordingly, the size of
the Award cannot serve as a basis to add barriers to the complex enforcement process that

Claimant has to follow. °!

76. Second, for Claimant, Applicant failed to demonstrate that: (i) lifting the provisional stay
would have the described consequences, especially when the social and fiscal problems
referred to by Applicant are not something new; (ii) its commitments to the IMF would

excuse Applicant from complying with its other international obligations; ** (iii) its

argument is different than the one brought before and rejected by the ad hoc committee in
Karkey v. Pakistan;°* and, more generally, (iv) its argument is different from the “general

circumstances” that would affect Pakistan at any time when complying with the Award.°>

77. 1n particular, Claimant highlights that the ad hoc committee in Karkey v. Pakistan stated
that Pakistan did not “provide specific evidence that gives rise to a particularized fear of

harm, since such effects are inherent and ‘normal’ to the pecuniary obligations imposed by

an adverse ICSID award”.°°

78. Third, Claimant argues that Applicant holds 100% of the Reko Diq project, a project of
enormous value as recognized by Applicant itself, and has had complete control over it for
more than seven years.” Because of this, nothing has prevented it from monetizing the
project, which Applicant can do through different mechanisms.** Accordingly, it is untrue
that the only way for Pakistan to pay the Award is through enacting austerity measures,

curtailing socioeconomic programs, or abandoning its IMF package.°”

79. In any case, even if it were true that Applicant cannot monetize the Reko Dig project, that
does not warrant the continuation of the provisional stay. Applicant has been on notice
about its obligation to comply with the Award since 12 July 2019. Further, in the course of

the annulment proceedings, Applicant has argued that it will be in a position to comply

with the Award “in, (say), 2-3 years’ time.”!° As expressed by the ad hoc committee in
von Pezold v. Zimbabwe, the intention to pay an award if the annulment request is rejected
implies that the payment itself would not have “catastrophic immediate and irreversible
consequences for the Respondent’s ability to conduct its affairs”. !°!

80. Fourth, Claimant sustains that lifting the provisional stay does not entail immediate
payment of the Award. Enforcement proceedings, especially against a State like Applicant
who has announced that it will oppose all enforcement efforts, “is a lengthy and difficult

process”, !

and lifting the stay of enforcement just “removes one [significant] hurdle [...]
to the lengthy and difficult process of obtaining actual compensation”. !° This has not been
altered by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially because Pakistan has not explained how
“enforcement actions would compromise its current or near-term efforts to respond to the
pandemic” and, if anything, the enforcement efforts may be even slower because of the

pandemic. !°*

(3) Prejudice to Claimant if the Stay is Continued
a. Applicant’s Position

81. Applicant argues that Claimant will not suffer any prejudice if the stay of enforcement is
continued since post-Award interest is accruing at a rate of USD 700,000 per day.!°°
Further, Applicant argues that there are no grounds for Claimant’s allegation that Pakistan

requested the stay to hide or shield assets. !°°

b. Claimant’s Position

82. For Claimant, a continuation of the stay would impose greater and unjustified burdens
because it would be forced to chase Applicant’s assets around the world after Applicant
has had more time to shield those assets.!°” Further, Claimant sustains that the post-Award
interest that was ordered is insufficient because it is not tied to Pakistan’s actual default
risk and, thus, is not even sufficient to maintain the market value of the Award. !°

According to TCCA, while interest may compensate for the time value of money, “[t]he

real prejudice of a continued stay is not the passage of time: it is the risk of Pakistan’s non-

compliance with any part of the Award”.!°° TCCA submits that due to the decline in the
interest rate under the Award such rate is “not even sufficient to maintain the market value
of the Award”. TCCA adds that the interest rate is actually lower than Pakistan’s borrowing

rate and incentivizes it to not pay the award.!!°

(4) Risk of Non-recoupment
a. Applicant’s Position

83. According to Applicant, if the stay of enforcement is lifted and the Award is later annulled,
it would be exposed to the risk of non-recoupment of any monies paid to Claimant under
the Award.'!! This has been widely recognized as a factor that warrants the continuation

of a stay.!!?

84. Applicant argues that the risk of non-recoupment is increased where the award creditor is
a shell company.!!? In the case at hand, as a shell company, monies received by Claimant
could be immediately distributed to its shareholders. !'* Further, the undertaking that
Claimant’s owners have made does not mitigate such risk since Applicant is unaware of
the precise terms of such undertaking and it is unclear whether Pakistan could invoke an
undertaking given by third parties for the benefit of Claimant.'' In any case, Applicant
argues that the costs associated with recoupment proceedings could be avoided if the stay

is continued.!!¢

85. Finally, Applicant considers that Claimant’s proposal to place the recovered funds in an
escrow while the Committee’s decision on annulment is pending does not solve the risk of
non-recoupment.!!” This is because placing the funds in escrow does not preserve the
status quo (e.g. the value of the money) at the time the funds are paid,''* and there is an

inherent risk associated with the logistical difficulties of managing the escrow account and

the relationship between the parties and the account/agent.!!°

b. Claimant’s Position

86. For Claimant, as recognized by previous ad hoc committees, the fact that a State may be
required to pay an award to be reimbursed later when the award is annulled is just a natural
consequence of the enforcement regime created by the ICSID Convention.'?° As such,

there is no risk of non-recoupment that could justify the stay to continue and, in any case,

generalized allegations about this cannot justify the continuation of the stay. '?!

Claimant argues that this does not change because it is a shell company. Claimant
highlights that: (i) it has always complied with the orders issued during the proceedings
and has paid all costs, including those that were Applicant’s responsibility; !?? and, (ii) it is
owned in equal shares, through a joint venture, by Antofagasta ple and Barrick Gold
Corporation, important mining companies. Both companies have “undertaken to provide
sufficient financial assistance to [Claimant] as and when it is needed to enable the
Company to continue its operation and fulfil all of its financial obligations”, which should

provide enough comfort to Applicant. !?>

In any case, if the Committee considers it necessary, Claimant offers to place the amounts
recovered through the enforcement of the Award in escrow while the annulment
proceeding is pending. '** Such “undertakings to hold assets in escrow are a routine part of
modern business and international arbitration practice”.'?° This would solve Applicant’s

concern regarding non-recoupment and “would mitigate any potential prejudice to

Pakistan while avoiding the prejudice to TCCA from a continued stay”.!2”

(5) Risk of Non-compliance with the Award
a. Applicant’s Position

Applicant rejects that continuing with the stay would pose a risk of non-compliance with
the Award on its part. Such position presumes that a State will not comply with its
international obligations, which is not a valid presumption, !”* and, in Applicant’s particular
case, it has always met its obligations with the World Bank institutions. !”° In particular,

First, where the continuation of the provisional stay was denied because of the risk of non-
compliance, such decision was based on “specific public statements or conduct by
respondent States suggest[ing] that those States were or would be unwilling to comply with
ICSID awards”. '*° In the case at hand, however, Applicant “complies, and will continue to
comply, with its international obligations, including those arising in respect of Article 53
of the ICSID Convention”!*! and, as such, is in a different situation than other ICSID award
debtors whose conduct warranted the lifting of the stay due to the risk of non-

compliance. !7?

Second, Applicant argues that Claimant has the burden of demonstrating Applicant’s
alleged misconduct, a burden that it has failed to meet.'** In any case, it argues that such
allegations of misconduct do not help the Committee in deciding whether Applicant will
comply with its international obligation to pay the Award.'* It also argues that, contrary
to what Claimant stated, the Tribunal did not consider that having recourse to the Supreme
Court was a means to avoid liability, that there were “abusive extension demands” or that
there were attempts to derail the proceedings with baseless corruption claims. '** The
Tribunal just decided that Applicant “had failed to prove any of its factual allegations of

corruption”. !7

Third, Applicant argues that, as stated by the ad hoc committee in Hydro v. Albania, the
most relevant metric is the State’s “historic compliance with ICSID awards”.'>” Before

ICSID, there has only been one other award issued against Applicant in Karkey v. Pakistan,

which was settled in the course of the revision proceedings. '** This shows Applicant’s
voluntary compliance with its obligations, something that does not change by the fact that
Applicant exercised its rights to seek annulment and revision of the Karkey v. Pakistan

award, !3°

Further, Applicant confirms that the only instance where a non-ICSID award creditor is
currently enforcing an award against Pakistan is in a case before the English High Court.'#°
In such case, arrangements are in place to pay the creditor in the next couple of weeks. This
shows that granting the stay would not force “[Claimant] backwards in a long queue of
creditors and thereby reduce its likelihood of being able to enforce the Award if it is not

annulled”. !4!

Notwithstanding the aforementioned, and although it believes that the Award must be
annulled, Applicant is willing to give an undertaking whereby it shows its willingness to
comply with its international obligations. This has been considered relevant by previous

ad hoc committees when deciding on the continuation of a stay.'*”

b. Claimant’s Position

committees, a factor that weighs against the continuation of the provisional stay is the risk
of non-compliance by the award debtor. '*7 In the case at hand, Claimant argues that there
is a substantial risk that Applicant will refuse to comply with the Award if the annulment

request fails.'*8 This is supported by the following arguments:

98. First, Claimant argues that Applicant’s misconduct during the underlying arbitration
demonstrates the existence of such risk. '4? Such misconduct includes delaying the
proceedings and increasing their costs through different “meritless” requests, defying
disclosure orders, refusing to produce original evidence and seeking to introduce new
evidence in violation of the Tribunal’s orders. '*° In particular, Claimant highlights the

(v) Repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempting to disqualify the members of the
Tribunal, '°’ with the purpose of suspending the proceedings and “improperly
leveraging procedural rules to unilaterally extend the timing of the pending
submissions”;!** All while Claimant was forced to bear a disproportionate amount

of the related costs to ensure that the proceedings could go forward.'*?

99. Second, for Claimant, the risk of non-compliance is further demonstrated by Applicant’s

groundless request to continue the stay of enforcement, which is just the latest tactic to

obstruct Claimant’s efforts to obtain compensation for Pakistan’s wrongful acts. '°°

100. Third, according to Claimant, the risk is further demonstrated by Applicant’s conduct in
Karkey v. Pakistan, the only other ICSID case that has resulted in an award against
Applicant. After the Karkey v. Pakistan award was issued, Pakistan created “repeated and
unwarranted delays, culminating in two years of post-award attempts to avoid paying
Claimant”, using the same arguments that Pakistan is using in this case, including that there

was no risk of its non-compliance with the decision of the ad hoc committee. '*!

Accordingly, Claimant requests the Committee not to be swayed by the same arguments,

especially in light of the “non-monetary” settlement reached by the parties in that case.!°

10

. Fourth, in Karkey v. Pakistan, Applicant avoided payment of the award by settling it for
“zero damages” with the direct involvement of the Turkish government.'® This cannot be
considered as compliance under the ICSID Convention, which necessarily entails the
prompt and voluntary payment of the obligations under the award.!® Thus, Applicant has

no history of promptly and voluntarily complying with ICSID arbitration awards. '®

102. Fifth, Claimant argues that the risk of non-compliance is real. According to it, Applicant
has “fail[ed] to disclose that non-ICSID creditors are currently pursuing collection efforts

against Pakistan in connection with unpaid awards and foreign judgements”. !°°

103. Finally, regarding the undertaking given by Applicant, Claimant considers it to be an
“empty assurance of compliance with the Award” presented by counsel that just restates
Pakistan’s current obligations under the ICSID Convention and does not reconcile

“Pakistan’s claims of inability to pay or its track record of non-compliance”. !°7

(CC. WHETHER THE STAY SHOULD BE CONDITIONAL
a. Applicant’s Position

10:

an

. Applicant argues that no security should be required as a condition for the continuance of
the stay of enforcement, and that the Committee should address the issue with caution and
within the terms of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention.!” This is based on the

following arguments:

10

x

. First, Applicant argues that nothing in Article 52(5) explicitly provides that the Committee

can, after deciding to continue the stay, move onto a further enquiry concerning security.!7!

10

a

. Second, requesting a security can go against the right to immunity that a State has over
specific assets since it forces the State to convert an asset that benefits from the rights of
Article 55 of the ICSID Convention to one that does not, and intrudes in the enforcement

of the award, over which the Convention does not give the ad hoc committee any power.!”

. Third, Applicant argues that even if the 25% of the Award is “far less than Pakistan owes”
it is inappropriate to ask an ad hoc committee to assume that the Award will not be

annulled.!73

109. Fourth, it is for Claimant to establish that the security should be ordered,!”* which it has
failed to do.'’° In any case, the request for a security of 25% is entirely arbitrary,'”° and is
unnecessary because Pakistan will comply with the Award and has given such

undertaking. '7’

110. Fifth, ordering security puts Claimant in a better position than it would otherwise be.!7*
Applicant quotes the Mitchell v. DRC case to argue that a security “is always a burden”
and “penalizes” the party seeking annulment. !” It further imposes additional and
unwarranted financial burdens on Applicant, who would be required to provide collateral,
pay bank fees and cover costs associated with obtaining and negotiating the security,
especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.'*? Mr. Afzal added that if the stay

was conditioned on security such as a bank guarantee and collateral “this would severely

undermine market confidence in Pakistan’s economic stability and credit-worthiness”. !*!

111. Sixth, for Applicant, posting security can be self-defeating since transferring funds to an
escrow account, or even a bank guarantee, imposes the risk of third-party attachment,

which could frustrate the very purpose of the security. !**

Seventh, a security is unnecessary because the provision of Applicant’s undertaking is
sufficient assurance. In terms of providing an undertaking, Pakistan has stated that “it

would be content with the language” in the undertakings ordered in Perenco v. Ecuador

and NextEra v. Spain.'® Accordingly, Pakistan proffered that the Attorney General could

“readily provide the new undertaking as described supra in Paragraph 95,'*4

b. Claimant’s Position

112. Claimant’s main contention is that Applicant has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating
the specific circumstances that would warrant the continuation of the provisional stay, a
burden that cannot be substituted with the provision of a security. '** However, if the
Committee considers that Applicant has discharged its burden, it should require Applicant
to post appropriate and effective security in return for the continued stay,'*® which the

Committee is well within its powers to order.!*”

113. More specifically, Claimant requests that Applicant be required to either “deposit into
escrow an amount equal to at least 25% of the Award, including interest, or to post an
unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or letter of credit” for the same amount,
“provided through a reputable international bank based outside Pakistan [...] within 30

days of the Committee’s decision on Pakistan’s Stay Request [...] for the duration of the
annulment proceedings, and should be released only on order of the ad hoc Committee.”!**

In particular, Claimant presents the arguments described infra:

114. First, for Claimant, this “is the minimum condition appropriate to mitigate the considerable
prejudice” that it could suffer if the stay is continued.!*° This is because: (i) it is necessary

to mitigate any substantial risk of non-compliance, as explained supra, which is not

compensated by post-award interest; '°° (ii) the size of the Award makes the need for
security particularly compelling;!°! and, (iii) overall, requesting such security from the
award debtor serves the purpose of deterring abuse of the ICSID annulment mechanism

which, in turn, reinforces the effectiveness and efficiency of the ICSID system.!*

115. Second, the Committee has the power to order such security. Claimant argues that: (i) as
recognized by previous ad hoc committees, such power is inherent to the Committee’s

discretion under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and the power to conduct the

93

proceedings; '°? and (ii) sovereign immunity has no bearing on this inherent power.

Article 55 of the ICSID Convention, contrary to Applicant’s position, has nothing to do
with the Committee’s powers to condition a stay of enforcement as it seems fit.' Further,
“t]he immunity of a State from execution (Article 55 of the Convention) does not exempt

it from enforcing the award’ pursuant to the orders of an ICSID tribunal or committee,

‘given its formal commitment in this respect following signature of the Convention.””!?°

116. Third, as the ad hoc committee in Carnegie v. Gambia recognized, such a security or
guarantee does not provide Claimant with an advantage. On the contrary, it remedies the
disadvantage of bearing the risks associated with the delay in enforcing the Award and
ensures that Claimant is not in a worse position as compared to other creditors not facing

the stay of enforcement. !%°

continuation of the stay to the posting of a security.'°” Applicant does not have a right to a

a continued stay in the first place and it would not suffer more harm by posting the security
than it would suffer when complying with its obligations under the Award since the
guarantee only operates if the annulment is rejected. !°* In any case, Applicant has failed to
prove that providing such security would be more burdensome than posting other types of
security and that the costs associated with posting such security are prohibitive. By all
means, Pakistan has the resources to escrow the funds or pay the costs associated with

obtaining a bank guarantee. '*?

118. Fifth, the risk of attachment by third parties, which previous ad hoc committees have
considered relevant, is not present in the case at hand and, in any case, can be largely

avoided by a careful structuring and design of the escrow agreement.”

119. Sixth, although Applicant argues that the 25% is completely arbitrary, it fails to propose

any alternative figure.?"!

Ill. THE COMMITTEE’S ANALYSIS

120. The Committee provides its analysis in the following manner by: (1) reviewing the
applicable legal standards, (2) considering whether a stay should be maintained or
discontinued, and (3) determining whether any conditions should be attached if a stay

should be maintained or discontinued.

A. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

121. The ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules provide the legal standards that

apply to an ICSID award, an annulment proceeding, and a stay of enforcement.

For an arbitral award rendered under the ICSID Convention, Article 53(1) provides as

follows regarding its status:

The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal
or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party
shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that
enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this
Convention.

. Despite the binding nature of an ICSID award, either party may seek an annulment pursuant

to Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that “[e]ither party may request

annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General”.

When a party seeks annulment, it may request a stay of enforcement under Article 52(5) of

the ICSID Convention as follows:

If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application,
enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such
request.

Under the ICSID Arbitration Rules, Rule 54 covers the relevant parts concerning a stay of

enforcement and provides as follows:

(2) If an application for the [ ] annulment of an award contains a request for a
stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of
registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon
as the [ ] Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within
30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue
the stay, it shall automatically be terminated [...].

(4) A request...[for a stay]...shall specify the circumstances that require the
stay.[...]
In terms of determining the applicable standards of whether to continue a stay, Article 52(5)
of the ICSID Convention only provides that “[t]he Committee may, if it considers that the

circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision”.

The Committee observes that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties as such is not
applicable to the ICSID Convention, which predates it. Nevertheless, its provisions on

treaty interpretation are widely regarded as declaratory of customary international law.

Both Pakistan and Australia are also contracting parties to the Vienna Convention. The
Committee considers it appropriate to be guided by the General Rule of Interpretation in
Article 31 of the Vienna Convention such that interpretation of relevant provisions of the
ICSID Convention will be conducted “in good faith and in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object

and purpose.”?°

The parties have referred to prior ad hoc committee decisions for the various criteria to be
considered when deciding a request for a stay of enforcement. The Committee confirms
that prior decisions of other ad hoc committees are non-binding, and notes, as prior ad hoc
committees have, that no jurisprudence constante can be discerned in this particular regard.
The Committee concludes that, subject to the specific facts of the relevant case, due
consideration should be given to earlier cases where they are indicative of a certain line of
jurisprudential consistency. 7°? The Committee’s decision remains one based on the

particular circumstances of the case at hand.

First, the Committee finds that based on the ordinary meaning of the word “may” in
Article 52(5) the ICSID Convention, the Committee has wide discretion to decide whether
to continue or terminate a stay of enforcement. Ad hoc committees generally agree with
this viewpoint.?>* The Committee concludes that it will exercise its wide discretion

fact-specific inquiry.

should consider in determining whether to continue a stay of enforcement. °° The
Convention and Rules stipulate that either party may request the continuation of the stay,
then Article 52(5) of the Convention merely provides that if the Committee considers the
“circumstances so require” it may stay enforcement, and Rule 54(4) of the Rules simply
provides the requesting party must specify the “circumstances that require” such
continuation. The texts of Article 52(5) or Rule 54(4) do not specify the “circumstances”
to be taken into account in determining whether the circumstances “require” a stay. What

qualifies as “require” is also undefined.

Based upon the ordinary meaning of the terms “circumstances” and “require”, the
Committee can find no presumption in favour or against the continuation of a stay of
enforcement. In particular, the Committee cannot extrapolate from the current ICSID
Convention and Arbitration Rules a presumption of “automatic” continuation of a
provisional stay without the need for substantiation.””° The ordinary meaning of the terms
“circumstances” and “require” are neutral and do not provide any “limitation or
qualification” or a “default rule”.?°” In particular, the term “require” does not warrant being
applied in a narrow manner. Similarly, the Committee does not agree that the context
provides support for a presumption in favour or against the continuation of a stay of
enforcement. Given the context in which Article 52(5) appears, it cannot be said that
annulment precedes or postdates enforcement. The finality and binding nature of an award

under Articles 53 and 54 also does not militate in favor of a presumption either way.

The Committee also does not find that the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention
provide support for a presumption in favour or against the continuation of a stay of
enforcement in the interpretation of Article 52(5). The text of the article merely provides

that a request for a stay is provisional “until the Committee decides”. The general purpose

as found in the first preambular paragraph to the Convention does not offer any meaningful
guidance on how Article 52(5) should be interpreted. It states a general declaratory purpose
for the “need for international cooperation for economic development, and the role of
private international investment therein”.”°* This does not weigh in favor of a presumption
either way. It is unclear why enforcement of an award based on international obligations
would be contrary to international cooperation for economic development as suggested by
Pakistan. Demonstrating Pakistan’s commitment to abide by its treaty obligations arguably
might provide comfort to foreign investors on how Pakistan adheres to the rule of law and
attract more foreign investment that could contribute to the country’s economic

development.

133. On similar lines, the Committee questions whether in terms of the relevant rules of
international law the right to life under Article 6(1) of the ICCPR or “public health rights
and public health emergencies of international concern” as provided under Article 13(1) of
the WHO’s International Health Regulations 2005 should be considered.” No evidence
exists that such rules ever were considered in the interpretation of Article 52(5). It appears
that no previous ad hoc committees considered them, or anything comparable. Insufficient
basis has been provided to consider such rules in the interpretation of Article 52(5). Even
if they could be considered as relevant rules of international law in the interpretation of
Article 52(5), whether such concerns are triggered in this case is also unclear. The chain of
events that exists between lifting a stay of enforcement and the triggering of the right to
life, public health rights, or public health emergencies of international concern appears too

long and tenuous, as explained infra.

134. In addition to the lack of automaticity, it cannot be said that absent “exceptional” or
“extraordinary” circumstances a stay should be continued, nor do exceptional
circumstances have to be shown for a stay to be maintained.”!° Not only do such qualifiers
not exist in the Convention or Rules, but no basis such as context or object or purpose

exists to justify their addition. Both parties acknowledge that the ICSID Convention and

the Arbitration Rules do not define the circumstances to be considered.!! The Committee
concludes that, in ruling on whether to maintain a stay, it needs to be satisfied of the
existence of circumstances generally that are unqualified and that are based upon the

submissions of the parties.

135. The Committee holds that the general principle of actori incumbit onus probation shall
apply such that the party seeking continuation of the stay must bear the burden to establish
that circumstances exist that require such continuation.”!” The parties also appear to agree
that the party seeking continuation of the stay bears the burden.”!* As a consequence, the
non-moving party does not have to show that circumstances exist that require lifting of the

stay.2!4

B. DECISION ON STAY

136. Ad hoc committees have taken into account a variety of criteria when deciding whether to
grant or deny a stay on enforcement. In reaching its decision on the stay of enforcement,

the Committee decides that it will focus on the following issues that the parties have

raised:?!5

(1) Good Faith of the Request for Stay
(2) Prejudice to Pakistan

(3) Prejudice to TCCA

non-compliance with other awards or failure to pay advances to cover the costs of arbitration proceedings, adverse

(4) Risk of Non-recoupment
(5) Risk of Non-compliance

137. The Committee notes that the parties appear to be in agreement that the merits of the
annulment proceedings do not need to be considered as part of the analysis of the

circumstances requiring the continuation of the stay.?!°

(1) Good Faith of the Request for Stay

138. Applicant claims that it brought its request for a stay in “good faith” and not as a “dilatory
tactic”.?!’ Pakistan argues that TCCA has not proven that Pakistan’s request for a stay was
not made in good faith or was intended to “hide or shield” its assets from enforcement, or
that the request for annulment was “manifestly dilatory or lacking in merit”.?!* Pakistan
argues that it has a compelling basis to challenge the Award based on, among other things,
a “key jurisdictional argument” and the “unprecedented adoption and application” of the
methodology applied in the calculation of the damages.!?

139. Claimant asserts that the stay request is another tactic to hinder and obstruct the
proceedings and an attempt to put off payment for the breach of treaty obligations.
Claimant asserts that Applicant has a track record of delay and obstruction.””° As was also
raised in its non-compliance argument against Applicant, Claimant cites Applicant’s
conduct during the Arbitration proceedings and the Karkey v. Pakistan proceedings as part
of its “record of obstructionist tactics and procedural manipulation” and as previewing its
post-Award tactics.?*! Claimant cites how the Karkey v. Pakistan tribunal found that
Pakistan “did not cooperate in good faith in the arbitral proceedings”, “made the Tribunal

spend a large part of the Hearing on unfounded. ..arguments of corruption”, and “requested

the introduction of additional evidence only at the end of the...proceedings causing

unnecessary disruption and expenses”.??? TCCA also alleges that a stay would allow

Pakistan to “hide or shield” its assets from enforcement.?”?

140. The Committee finds that it has not been demonstrated that Pakistan’s request for a stay
was not in good faith or brought as a “dilatory tactic”. TCCA has not established a pattern
of delay and obstruction or potential for assets to be hidden or shielded. The Committee
notes that the Tribunal in the underlying case, unlike the Karkey v. Pakistan tribunal, did
not find that Pakistan “did not cooperate in good faith”, or employed “dilatory tactics”.°*4
Although the Tribunal did find that Pakistan “raised various defenses in the arbitration
which were found to be almost entirely meritless but nevertheless caused the proceedings
to extend over a significant period of time and the Parties to incur large amounts of costs”,
it did not find that this amounted to a lack of good faith.2*> While the Committee notes the
concerns raised by TCCA, it finds that, even if Pakistan’s conduct in the Karkey v. Pakistan
case is considered together with its conduct during the proceedings in the Arbitration, this

would be insufficient to establish a lack of good faith or a pattern to hinder and obstruct.

141. The Committee agrees that unless an application for annulment is manifestly dilatory or
frivolous or obviously unmeritorious the Committee should not be concerned with its
merits when reviewing a request for a stay of enforcement. Claimant has not argued that
the Annulment Application is manifestly dilatory or frivolous or obviously unmeritorious,

so the merits of the application need not be considered.

142. The Committee holds that it has not been demonstrated that Applicant’s request for a stay

of enforcement was not made in good faith.

(2) Prejudice to Pakistan

143. Pakistan submits that immediate enforcement of the Award would lead to dire

consequences to the country at a “uniquely bad moment in time”.?”° Pakistan emphasizes

the hardship it would suffer due to the delicate state of the economy that needed a
USD 6 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility in July 2019.7?’ As Pakistan argues, immediate
enforcement would entail immediate payment of the full amount of the USD 5.9 billion
Award that would have an “immediate and potentially devastating effect on Pakistan’s
fragile economy”.??* Immediate payment would lead to removal of funding for health,
social, and welfare programs that would have “disastrous impacts for the people of
Pakistan...particularly the most disadvantaged and vulnerable”. 7? Balochistan, the
location of the Reko Diq mine, is particularly vulnerable. Pakistan adds that immediate
enforcement would even affect its ability to respond to security threats, including dealing

with terrorist threats, terror financing, and money-laundering.

144. Mr. Afzal, the Additional Secretary (External Finance), Finance Division in the Ministry
of Finance and Revenue, also stresses that if the stay is lifted “Pakistan’s international
partners who have pledged a total of around USD 38 billion would also very likely
withdraw their support since this has been explained as conditional upon implementation
of the IMF program”.?*° He suggests that “international development partners like the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank withdraw support when a country in a

vulnerable economic situation is not being guided and supported by the IMF”.?*!

145. According to Pakistan, its predicament has become more fragile due to the recent

COVID-19 crisis that has engulfed the world. Pakistan notes that the pandemic has

“unknown and uncertain economic, health and welfare impacts”.?°?

146. Pakistan pleads that these factors combine to demonstrate the overwhelming hardship it
would face at this juncture due to an immediate enforcement of the Award. A stay of

enforcement would grant it “vital time” to plan and make a more “gradual and careful

reallocation of funds”. This importance of a reprieve is compounded by the uncertainties

arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.

147. While not being unsympathetic to Pakistan’s concerns, TCCA challenges its claims. TCCA
emphasizes that Pakistan has had plenty of time to prepare for the payment of the Award.
Pakistan’s situation will not be different in “2-3 years’ time” by which time the Committee
will have rendered its decision on annulment. TCCA cites that the IMF rescue is not new
to Pakistan because it suffers from chronic problems as indicated by it receiving 21 IMF

loan agreements and 12 bailouts for over the past three decades.?**

148. TCCA asserts that even if the stay is terminated in the ICSID proceedings, it will not lead
to immediate enforcement because, given Pakistan’s challenges and appeals, to collect
from the Award it will take on average 18-24 months for actual execution and attachment

to occur in local courts around the world.

149. Even if Pakistan’s claims of hardship are as serious as it claims, it has control and
ownership of the invaluable Reko Diq mines that can be monetized easily. TCCA stresses
that Pakistan has had more than eight years to monetize this asset and any delay is its own

fault.

150. The Committee decides that it must assess the potential hardship Pakistan may suffer as a
result of maintaining the stay with conditions or of terminating it. On one side of the
spectrum, the possibility of hardship could be altogether avoided if the stay were
maintained. On the other side of the spectrum, the question is what the consequences of

lifting the stay would be in terms of the likelihood and severity of hardship.

151. The essence of Pakistan’s argument revolves around the likelihood and severity of the
hardship it would endure if it immediately had to pay the entire USD 5.9 billion Award as
a result of immediate enforcement. USD 5.9 billion is no doubt a significant sum for a
developing economy such as Pakistan to bear under its current circumstances. The
Committee recognizes that Pakistan could face challenging prospects if it had to pay the

entire Award on an immediate basis. Unlike in other cases where the amounts have been

smaller and the circumstances less specific, the potential severity of hardship to Pakistan

in such a situation has been sufficiently particularized.

152. Nevertheless, the Committee does not find that the likelihood of severe hardship is as
compelling as Pakistan claims. A lifting of the stay would not lead to an immediate chain
of events, starting with immediate enforcement and ending with immediate payment. The
Committee finds weight in the evidence that TCCA presented in Annex A of its Rejoinder
on the numerous examples of how long actual enforcement can take for an award creditor
in an ICSID case.?* A lifting of the stay does not appear to lead to immediate enforcement
in local courts given the defences, challenges, and appeals that can be mounted by an award
debtor. This appears to be the situation transpiring in the U.S. and Australian courts where
TCCA is seeking enforcement and is being met by Pakistan’s defences. Even if defences
are overcome, the next hurdle is identifying assets and attaching them. Another hurdle is
that national courts might even grant a separate stay of enforcement of an ICSID award
irrespective of ongoing ICSID annulment proceedings.**> The fact that other ad hoc
committees did not consider the challenges and delays in enforcement is not determinative

and appears to be because such arguments were not raised in past cases.

153. Each enforcement example in Annex A of TCCA’s Rejoinder may be case specific and the
Committee may not be able to determine the situation behind each one, but the end result
was that payment did not occur immediately despite the enforcement efforts of the award
creditors. On average, considerable time was necessary and elapsed after the lifting of a
stay and many cases appear to be ongoing. Out of the 10 cases that were identified, five
cases ended in settlement, or partial or full enforcement by payment, attachment, or other
means, after an average of 17 months; the other five cases were ongoing and on average
22 months elapsed, and for the OJ European Group v. Venezuela case 43 months

transpired. 7° Claimant’s enforcement actions in the U.S. and Australia that were

power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort

commenced on 1 August 2019 and 15 October 2019, respectively, appear to continue after

more than 13 months and 10.5 months, respectively.?>”

154. At the same time, the Committee does not find Mr. Afzal’s dire assessment convincing that
“a very high probability” exists that immediate enforcement would lead to the withdrawal
of international support and other disastrous consequences.”** TCCA instituted arbitration
against Pakistan at ICSID on 28 November 2011, and the multibillion dollar contingent
liability arising from it has been known since that time. Any effect on market confidence,
economic stability, and creditworthiness must have been taken into consideration by the
IMF and other international development partners since this claim has been hovering over
the country. The IMF and others must have been more than aware of the potential liability
of a multi-billion award when the IMF announced the EFF package on 3 July 2019,
particularly given that the decision on liability was made on 10 November 2017.7°° Notably,
the IMF’s support or any other “international financial support” that may have been
contingent upon the EFF package does not appear to have been altered or affected in any

way after the USD 5.9 billion Award was announced nine days later on 12 July 2019.

155. On 16 April 2020, even with potential lifting of the stay of enforcement hanging in the
balance, the IMF approved an additional disbursement of USD 1.386 billion “to address
the economic impact of the COVID-19 shock”.?*° Again, it must be presumed that the IMF
was aware that the entire amount of the Award could be subject to enforcement action at a
moment’s notice with a lifting of the stay. Hence, Mr. Afzal’s apprehension that the lifting
of the stay would lead to a derailment of the IMF loan package and withdrawal of the
international financing support that was contingent on the implementation of the IMF
package appears overstated. Pakistan’s creditworthiness or its ability to receive IMF

support has not been affected by the Award.

156. Taking the COVID-19 pandemic into consideration, the Committee finds that the “capacity
to respond promptly and effectively to a pandemic” would also not be affected by the lifting
of the stay. This is based on the same lack of immediacy explained above.”*! For similar
reasons, Applicant’s concerns that its right to life obligations under ICCPR or its
obligations under the WHO’s International Health Regulations might be affected could
hardly be triggered by any lifting of the stay. The same reasoning applies to its national

security concerns.

157. Hence, while the Committee recognizes the potential hardship that Pakistan may suffer due
to a lifting of the stay, it is not convinced of the likelihood that Pakistan would suffer the
severe hardship on an immediate basis to the degree it claims. Enforcement would be
delayed, and payment of the entire Award would not be immediate. Finally, Pakistan’s
creditworthiness or its ability to maintain and receive IMF support should remain
unaffected, particularly since the international community has been well aware of the

contingent liability of the Award and the potential lifting of the stay.

(3) Harm to TCCA

158. TCCA emphasizes the damages it has suffered due to Pakistan’s breaches of its treaty
obligations almost 10 years ago. An unconditional stay would prolong the delay in
compensation, particularly given “a systematic campaign to obstruct TCCA’s efforts to

242 and the difficulties with enforcement as outlined above in

vindicate its rights’
Section (2). It would also not “redress the inherent prejudice of being compelled to stay
one’s hand, while other creditors...proceed unencumbered with their own collection efforts

against the debtor’. 747 TCCA argues that the post-award interest is inadequate to

compensate for its losses.

159. Pakistan stresses that TCCA will suffer no economic hardship if the stay is continued. This

is because it is a “shell company” that was “established for the sole purpose of the Reko

Dig project and pursues no other activities”.*“ It is protected by the post-award interest
accruing on the Award and through the interest it will be in a better position if the Award
is not annulled.**> Unlike in other cases where there are many creditors, a stay would not
“force TCCA backwards in a long queue of creditors and thereby reduce its likelihood of

being able to enforce the Award if it is not annulled”.4°

The Committee finds that TCCA has demonstrated that it will suffer prejudice if the stay
of enforcement is continued until the decision on annulment. First, an unconditional stay
would delay TCCA’s compensation due under the Award. Second, given that Pakistan
could be constrained by its financial ability to meet its obligations, particularly due to the
amount, it could reasonably be suggested that TCAA’s prospects of being paid in a timely
manner could be affected and the risk of further delay and uncertainty exists. This all
amounts to prejudice, which would be increased if TCCA was placed behind in the queue

of other creditors such as international financial partners.74”

The payment of post-award interest does not sufficiently compensate TCCA if the stay is
continued. The Committee agrees with the finding made by various other ad hoc
committees that interest does not adequately compensate an award creditor.*** Among
other things, interest does not compensate an award creditor for the opportunity to use the
benefits of the award. As the ad hoc committee in NextEra v Spain determined,
“(depriving the award creditor of their rightful remedy denies them the opportunity to
allocate the benefits of such remedy as they see fit” and “while post-award interest may
provide some relief, it may not adequately compensate for the uncertainty, delay, and

deprivation suffered by the award creditor”.

Contrary to Pakistan’s proposition that cites NextEra v Spain as support that post-award

interest together with an undertaking would remedy any prejudice from delays, as found

infra in Paragraph 202, the Committee finds that the present case differs from NextEra v
Spain because of the nature of the undertaking that Pakistan proposes. Any delay in
compensation just prolongs the violation of the award creditor’s rights and the damages it

suffered.

The Committee recognizes that TCCA will suffer a degree of prejudice as a result of

continuing an unconditional stay.

(4) Risk of Non-Recoupment

Pakistan claims that a material risk of non-recoupment exists if the Award is annulled given
that Claimant is a “shell company (with separate legal personality to its foreign joint
venture owners)”.”°° Applicant cites that TCCA made a loss of around USD 16 million in
2017 and 14 million in 2018.?>! In the eyes of Applicant, “the risk of a distribution of sums
acquired through enforcement to shareholders, and of an inability to recoup from TCCA,
is therefore real”.?*? Applicant claims that Claimant’s offer to place any funds recovered
by enforcement in escrow “will not preserve the status quo” given the logistical difficulties

that could arise and would not be a “viable solution”.*>3

TCCA in turn submits that no risk of non-recoupment exists given that its two parent
companies are large, well-established companies. Furthermore, both parent companies
have “undertaken to provide sufficient financial assistance to [TCCA] as and when it is
needed to enable the Company to continue its operations and fulfil all of its financial
obligations.”?*+ TCCA itself has also offered to place any funds obtained by enforcement

into an escrow account, which is a simple and straightforward task.

The Committee finds that Pakistan has not presented persuasive evidence that it may face
reasonable risk that it would not be able to recoup any payment made to TCCA if the

Committee annuls the Award. The chances that a party may have to seek recoupment of

any sums paid for an award that is later annulled are inherent in the system. Pakistan has
not demonstrated any “material risk” of non-recoupment that could be deemed credible or
substantiated any prospects of TCCA hiding and shielding assets obtained through

enforcement.”*>.

TCCA is a company owned as a joint venture by Antofagasta plc, “a leading copper mining
company”, and Barrick Gold Corporation, “the world’s largest gold mining company”.?°°
TCCA has invoked a commitment from its Annual Report Fiscal Year 2018 to the effect
that the two owners undertook to provide financial assistance to TCCA as a going concern.

The Annual Report provides in full as follows:

The Directors of Antofagasta ple and Barrick Gold Corporation have accepted the
responsibility of providing and has undertaken to provide sufficient financial
assistance to [TCCA] as and when it is needed to enable the Company to continue
its operations and fulfil all of its financial obligations The undertaking is provided
for a minimum period of twelve months from the signing date of the annual report.

Therefore the Directors are of the opinion the Company is a going concern.”*’

The Annual Report was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is a prominent
accounting firm, and it is presumed to have reviewed the relevant board resolutions and
other supporting material from Antofagasta and Barrick Gold Corporation as part of its
audit. The Committee therefore finds the commitments by the two owners credible. No
contradictory evidence has been offered. Notably, the original undertakings were provided
for a “minimum period of twelve months from the signing date of the annual report”, which

was 29 April 2019.

In addition, even if the “risk is real” regarding the ability to recoup, TCCA has offered to
hold in escrow any amount it recovers to address Pakistan’s potential concerns.”** Contrary
to Pakistan’s assertion, the Committee finds the “solution of an escrow account” to be “a
viable one”.*°? Pakistan’s claims that an escrow would not be appropriate and would be
difficult because it would have to be received from “a variety of jurisdictions across a
variety of currencies” is not persuasive. Other concerns about “logistical difficulties”
associated in the management of an escrow account and management of the relationship of
the parties with the account or agent are equally unconvincing given the widespread and
common use of escrow accounts. In any event, TCCA can bear any such issues under the
Committee’s direction. Furthermore, as noted above, both of TCCA’s owners, Antofagasta
ple and Barrick Gold Corporation, previously provided an undertaking to financially assist
TCCA.™ Under these circumstances, the Committee does not see why an escrow account

would “make restitution...impossible” if the Award is annulled.?°!

The likelihood of attachment by Pakistan’s creditors has not been demonstrated and
conflicts with Pakistan’s own assertion that other creditors with competing claims do not
exist.?©? Pakistan admitted that the case before the English High Court seeking around GBP
17 million is “the only instance of an award creditor currently enforcing an award against

it”.°° Pakistan also confirmed that “arrangements are in place for the sum to be
paid...which payment is expected to be completed within weeks”.*° Any potential
attachment by Pakistan’s creditors, hence, appears unlikely under the circumstances. Even
if it is considered a possibility, this would not be a risk caused by the escrow but by
Pakistan’s own pre-existing debt obligations to others. Finally, any potential attachment

would negatively affect TCCA as well if the Award were not annulled. If anything, it is a

neutral factor that affects both parties in a similar manner. At the same time, the possibility

that TCCA’s creditors might seek attachment has not been raised.

The Committee concludes that Pakistan has not established that it may face a compelling
risk of non-recoupment in light of TCCA’s offer to place in escrow any monies obtained

through enforcement of the Award.

(5) Risk of Non-compliance

Pakistan posits that it has never not complied with an ICSID award. To Applicant, the
parties’ procedural conduct in the Arbitration is irrelevant to the issue of the stay.7°> No
risk of non-compliance exists in the present case. All the cases brought against Pakistan to

date have been settled or discontinued by the investors or no liability was found.?©°

TCCA argues that given the substantial risk of non-compliance by Pakistan of the Award
this weighs against continuing the stay. TCCA primarily bases the risk upon Pakistan’s
conduct during both the proceedings of the Arbitration and the Karkey v Pakistan case.
According to TCCA, Pakistan disregarded the Tribunal’s procedural orders, sought
unreasonable extensions, engaged in obstruction and delay tactics, pushed questionable
witnesses, fabricated evidence, and made meritless challenges against the Tribunal
members. TCCA emphasizes that the Karkey v Pakistan case confirms a pattern of
misconduct and settlement does not qualify as compliance so Pakistan has never complied

with an ICSID award.

The Committee finds that an assessment of the potential for non-compliance should be a
fact-specific inquiry that should depend upon the circumstances. The Committee notes that
while the Tribunal dismissed many aspects of Pakistan’s claims and defences, the Tribunal
did not explicitly find misconduct and, unlike the Karkey v. Pakistan tribunal, did not find

it did not cooperate in good faith. The Tribunal did not sanction Pakistan per se. It did hold

Pakistan accountable for costs, but this appears to be primarily based on TCCA prevailing

on the merits.

175. The Committee finds that the asserted pattern of conduct is inconclusive and even with the
Karkey v. Pakistan case is insufficient to be considered evidence of either compliance or a
tisk of non-compliance. The Committee also finds that one settlement cannot be presumed

to be evidence of a risk of non-compliance of a party’s obligations.?°”

176. The Committee understands the points raised in Burlington v. Ecuador that “post-award
negotiations and a settlement, including a cut in the amount awarded by a tribunal . . . is
not what compliance means under the ICSID Convention”, and stated in Tenaris v
Venezuela (Il) that “[lJeaning back in waiting until the award creditor commences
enforcement proceedings because voluntary compliance is not forthcoming” would
constitute non-compliance of ICSID Convention obligations.”® Yet, the Committee notes
that Tenaris v Venezuela (Il) also suggested that “good faith negotiations and arrangements
between the parties as to payment modalities if they are conducted diligently and

expeditiously” could be considered compliance.?”

177. The settlement in Karkey v. Pakistan was reached after the parties mutually agreed to
suspend the annulment and revision proceedings. It would not be unreasonable to presume
that they were carrying out “good faith negotiations and arrangements”. They apparently
achieved a “non-monetary reconciliation”.””° The Committee therefore does not find such

settlement to be determinative in showing a risk of non-compliance on Pakistan’s part.

178. The Committee holds that TCCA has not demonstrated a risk of non-compliance by

Pakistan with the Award if it is not annulled.

(6) Sub-conclusion

The Committee considers that it should balance the overall interests affected and the
circumstances to determine whether the stay on enforcement should be maintained. In this
determination the Committee finds the potential prejudice that each party would suffer to

be among the most significant factors.

As reviewed above, the Committee finds that there is insufficient basis to hold that Pakistan
has not acted in good faith or has been dilatory or obstructive in seeking the stay of
enforcement. Also as found earlier, Pakistan’s difficulties in recoupment if the Award is
annulled and TCCA’s concerns over Pakistan’s non-compliance if the Award is not

annulled do not appear justified.

The Committee takes note of Pakistan’s concern over the impact that enforcement of the
Award would have on the country, particularly on its economy and social welfare while
the country is facing a widespread crisis and the ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the size of the Award, the burden to Pakistan as the award debtor is potentially
magnified. The prospect of severe hardship has been particularized. The likelihood of a
lifting of the stay leading to immediate enforcement and consequently to immediate and
severe hardship, on the other hand, has not been convincingly demonstrated. Immediate
and severe hardship does not appear apparent, particularly if the alternative relief requested
by TCCA is considered. In any event, it may reasonably be argued that the risk of exposing
the country to hardship, although not immediate and severe, exists and could be avoided

by maintaining the stay.

At the same time, the Committee takes note of the extended delay that TCCA has had to
suffer in receiving compensation from a binding ICSID award. The post-award interest in
this case does not adequately cover for the damages and costs and the deprivation of the
benefits of the Award. Each additional day prolongs TCCA’s prejudice as a result of the

denial of compensation.

Based upon the considerations examined above, the Committee finds that whether a
continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award should be maintained shall be
determined after reviewing whether the stay should be maintained on an unconditional or

57

conditional basis. The Committee next determines below the implications of the alternative
relief requested by TCCA and whether the stay in such case should be granted

unconditionally or conditionally.

(CC. WHETHER THE STAY SHOULD BE CONDITIONAL
(1) Security

184. Pakistan argues that any stay should be unconditional, particularly if the stay is based on
the hardship that it may suffer from immediate enforcement. Applicant submits that a stay
should not be conditioned on a financial security. Applicant adds that the ICSID
Convention does not explicitly grant the power to order a security but it does not dispute
that the Committee has the discretionary power to condition a stay particularly by such
means as a security or undertaking.*”! Pakistan nevertheless argues that “caution is
warranted” with regard to the issuance of a security.*”* Applicant believes a security places
the “award creditor in a better position than it would otherwise be in”.*”? To Applicant, a
security “in effect places a respondent State in a position where it would be forced to waive
immunity over the secured amount/asset”.?”* Mr. Afzal added that a security “would
severely undermine market confidence in Pakistan’s...economic stability and credit-

worthiness”.?75

185. According to Applicant, in cases where detailed evidence of hardship was found such as
MINE v. Guinea, Mitchell v. DRC, or Carnegie v. Gambia, ad hoc committees have
continued stays without conditions.?” Applicant stresses that TCCA has not been able to
point to a single case where an ad hoc committee received detailed evidence on hardship,

accepted that a stay was required on grounds of hardship, but then went on to order security.

21 Applicant’s Response, 40. Applicant initially suggested that Article 55 was “inconsistent with such a power” to
grant a security and cited Carnegie v Gambia for support that an ad hoc committee does not have the power to engage
in the enforcement process through the provision of security but appears to have modified its position subsequently.

In addition to the financial burden of providing a security, which would include the need
to provide collateral and pay bank fees, a risk exists that a third-party could seek to attach
the security.?”’ Finally, a security is unnecessary because the provision of Pakistan’s

undertaking is sufficient assurance.

186. TCCA, as its alternative relief request, proposes that if a stay is ordered then Pakistan
should be required to post a deposit or guarantee of at least 25% of the Award and a specific
undertaking that, among other things, it will waive its defences and immunity and pay the
Award if it is not annulled. Claimant argues that the Committee has the power and authority

to order a security and undertaking.

187. TCCA counterargues that several ad hoc committees considered claims of hardship and
determined either that the hardships were insufficient to warrant continuation of the stay
without security, or that the hardships reinforced the risk of non-compliance that warranted
the imposition of security. ’* TCCA remains critical of Pakistan’s proposed new
undertaking and argues that it grants a “grace period” of six months that gives TCCA less

protection because it amounts to a six-month delay in enforcement.

188. The Committee observes that the parties agree that the Committee has the discretionary
power to condition the stay.?”? The Committee agrees that its broad discretion to grant a
continued stay “logically includes medium solutions as a compromise, such as granting a
conditional stay.”?*° While the practice of ad hoc committees has been varied and statistics
are not determinative, recent trends also suggest that more stays, if they are not denied, are

being granted conditionally. As noted in ICSID’s “Updated Background Paper on

Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID”, the majority of ad hoc committees
granting stays required the issuance of a security or written undertaking.7*! Ad hoc

committees have granted stays of enforcement based on a variety of conditions.

The Committee notes that maintaining the stay on a conditional basis through a security
can serve multiple purposes. As an alternative form of relief, TCCA requested that Pakistan
pledge a financial security for at least 25% of the Award, which stands with interest at
approximately USD 1.5 billion. The Committee finds that both parties’ concerns could be

taken into consideration through such a security.

For the award creditor, TCCA, as found in Mitchell v. DRC, a financial security serves as
“the counterbalance to the delay in [the beneficiary’s] satisfaction through payment of the

o» 282

amount of the award, which in principle should be immediate. As provided in

Schreuer’s Commentary, another purpose is that a security “facilitates enforcement”.?*>
Through a security, “the award creditor’s annulment risk may be suitably offset by a
reduction of his enforcement risk”.?** Another function is that a “security is necessary to
ensure that the award creditor is not in a materially worse position when compared to other

creditors”.?8°

For the award debtor, Pakistan, a security has various advantages, especially given the
potential hardship to Pakistan. As a condition for continuing the stay, the Committee finds
that a security for such lesser amount could diminish, in multiple ways, the burden that
Pakistan may face. First, Pakistan would at an initial stage be responsible for only one-
quarter (1/4) of the USD 5.9 billion Award. Second, it would have to offer a guarantee only
for USD 1.5 billion, which at fees of 2-3% Pakistan’s counsel confirmed would amount to

USD 30-45 million with collateral.?*° Third, the financial security would only need to be

provided for a limited time period until the decision on annulment, which is not expected
to exceed two years.”*’ Unlike the prospects of immediately paying USD 5.9 billion, the
Committee does not find that payment of a guarantee or letter of credit of USD 30-45
million for a limited period, even if a considerable amount, would lead to the severe
hardship claimed. The Committee notes that, as of February 2020, USD 30-45 million
would amount to 0.23-0.35% of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves that stand at USD

12.8 billion.288

192. The Committee finds that, among other things, the Reko Diq mine should be able to serve
as sufficient collateral and, if it cannot, this responsibility lies with Pakistan. The Chairman
of the Board of Governors of the Reko Diq project Dr. Samar Mubarakmand valued the
mine at approximately USD 270 billion.”*? Even if it is based on the contingency of its
future development and presently is a non-producing asset, given its estimated USD 200
billion plus value, it would appear to be more than sufficient to serve as collateral. The
Committee finds that Pakistan has not convincingly explained why, through the mine, “[i]t
would also be unrealistic to expect...an up-front licensing fee [that] would be a significant
percentage of the Award”. In contrast, counsel for Pakistan and Balochistan themselves
admitted in 2014 that “there is therefore no impediment to or restriction on the
Governments of Pakistan and Balochistan dealing with the deposits as they deem fit. For

example, the Government can lease the Reko Diq deposits to other investors.”7?!

If, for some reason, Reko Diq cannot qualify as sufficient collateral, the Committee finds
that this predicament should be attributed to Pakistan. The Committee notes that as far back
as October 2012 Pakistan provided in a submission that at the H4 Tanjeel mine
“preparation for the excavation of the ore [was] due to commence in 6 months”.?°?
Subsequently, at a hearing held in 6 November 2012, Respondent’s counsel stated that
“[y]es, there will be mining in the H4 deposit within the space of the coming year.”?”
Pakistan has had control over Reko Dig since the Tribunal’s provisional measures decision
on 13 December 2012 and could have commenced efforts to monetise at least the H4
Tanjeel mine since that date.** The reasons for the delay in developing Reko Diq and the
lack of progress are all the more puzzling in light of Pakistan’s proclaimed unfortunate
economic challenges, particularly in recent years. Pakistan has not adequately explained
why such development has not occurred. Given the extended period that has elapsed since
Reko Dig has been under Pakistan’s control, any failure or inability to monetize it so that

it could at least serve as collateral is not the fault of TCCA and instead must be attributed

to Pakistan.

Instead of undermining market confidence and leading to a loss of foreign investment and
a downgrading of Pakistan’s creditworthiness, providing security could instead inspire
confidence by demonstrating Pakistan’s commitment to abide by its obligations. This could
attract more foreign investment and enhance its creditworthiness in the process. The
Committee does not see how public knowledge of a security could “severely undermine
market confidence in Pakistan’s economic stability and credit-worthiness”, particularly
since the contingent liability of the USD 5.9 billion Award has been known.” The
prospects of the provisional stay being lifted for the entire Award have been known since

the Annulment Application, and a security would be far less burdensome than being

responsible for the entire Award. The Committee also does not find that a security places

Claimant in a “better position than it would otherwise be in”.°°

195. Applicant’s claim that requiring a security would force it to waive immunity over the
secured amount is also not persuasive. How the security is provided is Applicant’s choice.
It can either provide the security through assets that are unencumbered by any immunity
concerns or it can waive the immunity to assets that are subject to immunity. Providing
security that is not subject to immunity or waiving immunity is not an undue imposition
upon Applicant over its objection and does not “penalize” it. It is merely part of the choice
given to Applicant in exchange for the benefit of maintaining the provisional stay of

enforcement of the Award.

196. The Committee agrees with Sempra v. Argentina that a security should correspond to an
“assessment of what is required to constitute an appropriate assurance” that the award
debtor will comply with an award.?°” TCCA requested as an alternative remedy a deposit
or guarantee or letter of credit of at least 25% of the Award. A request for a security for
less than the full quantum of an award, let alone only one-quarter or less of its entire amount,
appears to be unprecedented. One would be hard pressed to characterize such a request as
“arbitrary” as suggested by Applicant. Instead, the request provides a benchmark for the
Committee to exercise its discretion.°* Most would deem the request generous given that
award creditors are practically unknown to request anything less than the full amount of an
award. The Committee considers a guarantee or letter of credit for 25% of the Award as

reasonable under the circumstances to provide appropriate assurance to TCCA.

197. At the same time, the Committee must consider the possibility that the Award may be
annulled. In this case, Pakistan will have unduly incurred the cost of the guarantee or letter
of credit for 25% of the Award. Applicant should be able to recoup these costs that it will

have to incur and should have assurance that Claimant will meet such financial obligations.

Therefore, since the possibility that the Award may be annulled remains, the Committee
exercises its broad discretion and concludes that, as a condition for granting the alternative
relief that Claimant seeks, it would be appropriate to require that Claimant should likewise
provide a financial security to cover Applicant’s cost of providing a guarantee or letter of

credit for 25% of the Award.

(2) Undertaking

198. The Committee next considers whether either of the parties should provide an undertaking

as part of the condition of granting the stay.

199. With regard to Pakistan providing an undertaking, the Committee first notes that Pakistan
will be providing a guarantee or letter of credit for a partial amount that constitutes only
25% of the Award. Second, the Committee finds that an undertaking could give greater
weight to and solidify a party’s obligations under Article 53. Third, the Committee cannot
disregard that Pakistan did not provide similar security on two occasions in Karkey v
Pakistan leading to two terminations of the stay of enforcement.” These factors offer
support for the view that Pakistan’s provision of a security should be supplemented by an

undertaking to give comfort to TCCA.

200. At the same time, the Committee considers that requiring Pakistan to provide an
undertaking with the security as part of the conditions of maintaining the stay also takes
into consideration Pakistan’s interests, which are comparably outlined supra in

Paragraph 191.

201. The Committee finds that continuing the stay with an appropriate undertaking balances the
interests and concerns of both parties. The Committee thus determines that Pakistan should

furnish an undertaking that it will pay the amount owed under the Award if it is not annulled.

202. In terms of the language of the undertaking, the Committee highlights that Pakistan

conceded that “it would be content with the language” in the undertakings ordered in

Perenco v. Ecuador and NextEra v. Spain.**° The new undertaking that Pakistan offered to
provide appears similar to the one required in NextEra v. Spain. Yet, the Committee agrees
with Claimant and finds the new undertaking wanting. First, it excludes the assurance that
Claimant “would not need to engage in any action to recognize, enforce, or execute the
Award under Article 54 of the ICSID Convention in any ICSID Contracting State” based
on Applicant providing complete compensation as required under the Award.*°! Another
primary difference is that the offered new undertaking requires 180 days to be provided as

opposed to 90 days in NextEra v. Spain.

The Committee determines that Pakistan should provide an undertaking to TCCA with the
specific assurance of compliance in terms of prompt, unconditional, irrevocable payment
of the amount due under the Award if it is not annulled within 120 days. The Committee
finds such an undertaking reasonable under the circumstances of granting a stay on
enforcement for the entire amount of the Award and ordering a guarantee or letter of credit
for only 25% of the Award. The Committee does not consider that ordering such an
undertaking to be a waiver of Pakistan’s rights or immunity. Instead, it grants Pakistan a
choice to make a promise to pay in the future in exchange for enjoying the benefits now of
a stay of the entire Award while only providing a partial security. If Pakistan fails to furnish
the undertaking within the time so prescribed (or such extended time as the parties so agree
or the Committee so permits), the stay of enforcement shall be terminated. Contrary to
TCCA’s claim, the Committee also finds that requiring payment within 120 days does not
constitute a four-month “holiday” but constitutes a binding promise to pay by that

deadline.*”

The Committee finds that certain aspects of the conditions that TCCA requested to be
included in the undertaking are unwarranted. Requiring a blanket waiver of immunity is a
proposition that arguably could encroach upon Pakistan’s rights under Article 55 of the

ICSID Convention. Similarly, the right to seek revision, for instance, is a separate right

guaranteed under the Convention and under the jurisdiction of a separate tribunal and it
would hence be inappropriate to be the subject of an undertaking. Being separate matters,
absent a clear showing otherwise, the Committee finds the connection between whether

Pakistan is considering a revision and its application for a stay too tenuous.

The Committee is mindful that TCCA did not request its specific undertaking in its request
for relief in either its Opposition or Rejoinder but only did so during its oral submission at
the Hearing, purportedly in response to Pakistan’s proposed undertaking. In this regard, at
Pakistan’s request, the Committee granted it an opportunity to be heard regarding TCCA’s
request through a separate submission after the Hearing.*°> The Committee finds that this
addresses any fairness issues over TCCA’s modified request for relief through its specific
undertaking. In any event, the Committee finds that given its broad discretionary power it
can condition the stay upon a more meaningful undertaking in addition to the financial

security.

On the other hand, the Committee considers whether TCCA should provide an undertaking
to deal with the contingency of the Award being annulled and in view of the obligations
now imposed on Pakistan. The Committee notes that TCCA offered to provide an
undertaking that it would pay any amounts that Pakistan could not recover from the escrow

account that would be established to hold any assets collected from enforcement.

The Committee therefore holds that TCCA shall provide an undertaking that, if the Award
is annulled, it will pay Pakistan any amounts that Pakistan cannot recover from the escrow
account that will hold any assets collected from enforcement, excluding those amounts due

to Pakistan’s third-party creditors.

(3) Conclusion

In conclusion, the Committee holds that the stay of enforcement shall be conditioned on

both parties providing appropriate security and undertakings. The Committee concludes

that this solution appropriately balances both parties’ concerns and interests under the

circumstances of the case.

209. The Committee holds that the stay of enforcement shall be conditioned on Pakistan
providing (1) a bank guarantee or letter of credit for 25% of the amount of the Award, and

(2) an appropriate undertaking that it will pay the Award if it is not annulled.

210. At the same time, the Committee holds that Pakistan’s obligations to secure the stay shall
be conditioned on TCCA (1) providing a financial security corresponding to the cost that
Pakistan incurs for providing the guarantee or letter of credit for 25% of the Award;
(2) placing into an escrow account under the sole control of an international escrow agent
and under the direction of the Committee any amounts recovered through enforcement;
and, (3) submitting an undertaking that, if the Award is annulled, it will pay any amounts
that Pakistan cannot recover from the escrow account that will hold assets obtained from

enforcement, excluding those amounts due to Pakistan’s third-party creditors.

IV.COSTS
211. Article 61(2) and Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47(1), and Rule 53 of

the ICSID Arbitration Rules grant the Committee discretion in the allocation of costs.

212. The Committee does not find it necessary to make a decision on costs at this preliminary
stage of the proceedings. The Committee confirms the parties’ respective positions on costs
and will take them into consideration when rendering its final decision on annulment. The
Committee requests that the parties maintain a separate account of their costs incurred

during this phase of the proceedings concerning the stay.

V. DECISION AND ORDERS

213. For the foregoing reasons, the Committee hereby:

(a) DECIDES that the stay of enforcement of the Award rendered on 12 July 2019
