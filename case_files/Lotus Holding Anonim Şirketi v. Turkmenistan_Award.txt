INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Turkey-Turkmenistan
Bilateral Investment Treaty which entered into force on 2 May 1992 (the “BIT” or
“Treaty”), the Energy Charter Treaty (“ECT”), and the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force
on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”). The dispute arose from certain energy
projects in the Republic of Turkmenistan (“Turkmenistan”) in which the Claimant was

involved.

On 28 July 2017, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 28 July 2017 from Lotus
Holding Anonim Sirketi against the Government of Turkmenistan (the “Request” or

“Request for Arbitration’).

The Claimant is Lotus Holding Anonim Sirketi (“Lotus” or the “Claimant”), a company

incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Turkey.
Funding support for Claimant is provided by LexShares, based in New York City.!

The Respondent is the Republic of Turkmenistan (the “Respondent” or “Turkmenistan”),

represented by its Government.

The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties”. The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page i.

This Award is made in the context of the Respondent’s application under Rule 41(5) of the
ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), seeking

summary dismissal of all the Claimant’s claims.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 28 July 2017, the Claimant filed its Request against Turkmenistan.

On 15 August 2017, ICSID sent a letter to the Claimant asking for further clarifications,

which were provided by the Claimant on 16 August 2017.

On 22 August 2017, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the

registration.

By letter of 11 October 2017, the Respondent conveyed its concerns regarding the
registration of the Request. It argued that there were numerous deficiencies and
irregularities in the documents that were relied upon in registering the case and reserved
its rights to seek remedies. These alleged deficiencies related (i) to the authorizations for
pursuing the claims at issue, and (ii) to the Claimant’s non-compliance with the

requirements of the Treaty on which it relied as the basis for consent to arbitration.

By letter of 24 October 2017, the Claimant informed ICSID that it wished the claim to be
heard by a tribunal constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b)
of the ICSID Convention. In the same letter, the Claimant appointed Mr. James H. Boykin,
a national of the United States of America, as arbitrator, and proposed to appoint a

candidate as President of the arbitral tribunal.

On 25 October 2017, ICSID notified the Parties that Mr. Boykin had accepted his

appointment as arbitrator in this case.

By letter of 20 November 2017, the Respondent: (i) appointed Professor Brigitte Stern, a
national of France, as arbitrator; (ii) informed ICSID that it did not accept the Claimant’s
proposal for the presiding arbitrator; and (iii) proposed another candidate for the presiding

arbitrator.

On 27 November 2017, ICSID notified the Parties that Prof. Stern had accepted her

appointment as arbitrator in this case.

23.

By letter of 28 November 2017, the Claimant informed ICSID that it did not accept the
Respondent’s proposed presiding arbitrator and requested that the Chairman of the ICSID
Administrative Council appoint the arbitrator not yet appointed and designate him or her
to be the President of the arbitral tribunal pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention

and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4.

By letter of the same date, ICSID informed the Parties that it would conduct a ballot to

assist the Parties in selecting a mutually agreeable presiding arbitrator.

On 13 December 2017, ICSID sent a ballot to the Parties with five names to consider as

presiding arbitrators and invited the Parties to submit their ballots.

On 5 March 2018, ICSID informed the Parties that the ballot process did not result in the
selection of a mutually acceptable candidate and that the appointment of the President of
the arbitral tribunal would proceed pursuant to Articles 38 and 40(1) of the ICSID

Convention.

On 22 March 2018, ICSID proposed the appointment of Professor Vaughan Lowe QC, a
national of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as the presiding

arbitrator in this case and invited the Parties to submit their observations by 28 March 2018.

On 5 April 2018, the Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1),
notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the

Tribunal was constituted on that date.

By letter of 6 April 2018, ICSID requested that each Party make an initial advance payment
of USD125,000 by 7 May 2018, in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial
Regulation 14(3).

On 4 May 2018, the Respondent submitted an Application under ICSID Arbitration
Rule 41(5) (the “Application” or the “Rule 41(5) Application”), together with exhibits
R- 01 through R-16, for dismissal of the claim on the ground that it is manifestly without

legal merit.

On7 May 2018, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit a response to the Respondent’ s
Application by 21 May 2018 and informed the Parties that it would hear the Parties on the
Respondent’s Application during the first session of the Tribunal, which was scheduled to

take place on 1 June 2018.

By letter of 14 May 2018, ICSID informed the Parties that it had not received payment

from either Party as requested in its 6 April 2018 letter.

By email of 14 May 2018, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal grant it an extension to

submit its response to Respondent’s Rule 41(5) Application.

On 15 May 2018, the Tribunal granted the Claimant’s request for an extension of time until

25 May 2018.

On 23 May 2018, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal grant a further extension of time

to submit its response to Respondent’s Application until 31 May 2018.

By email of the same date, the Respondent (i) objected to the Claimant’s request for a
further extension; (ii) noted that the Claimant had still not paid its share of the advance
payment; and (iii) suggested that the case be suspended if such payment had not been made

by the 30 May 2018 deadline.

On 24 May 2018, the Claimant responded to the Respondent’s objection and renewed its

request for an extension of time.

On the same date, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it: (i) granted the Claimant’s
request for an extension to file its Response to the Respondent’s Rule 41(5) Application by
30 May 2018; (ii) would schedule a further round of written submissions on the Rule 41(5)
Application; and (iii) would schedule an oral hearing on the Rule 41(5) Application after
the written submissions were complete if the Tribunal considered that it would find it
helpful to hear oral argument. The Tribunal further noted that the 30 May 2018 deadline
also applied to the transmission of the advance payments and that the first session
scheduled on 1 June 2018 would only take place if the funds had been received by 30 May
2018 as requested in the Centre’s notice of default dated 14 May 2018.

of the advance payment only if and when the Claimant paid its share.

under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) (“Claimant’s Response”), together with exhibits C-1

by the 30 May 2018 deadline, the first session scheduled for 1 June 2018 was cancelled.

On 8 June 2018, the Respondent submitted its Reply Submission in further support of its
Application under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) (“Respondent’s Reply”), together with
exhibits R-17 through R-22.

On 12 June 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide an update of the status of their

payments by 15 June 2018.

On 17 June 2018, the Claimant submitted its Response to the Respondent’s Reply
(“Claimant’s Rejoinder”), together with exhibits C-10 through C-17.

On 18 June 2018, the Tribunal reiterated its invitation to the Parties to provide an update

of the status of their payments by the end of the day.

By letter of 19 June 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it would be able to remit

its share of the advance payment by the end of July 2018.

By letter of 25 June 2018, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal: (i) invite the

Claimant to explain the reason for its failure to pay its share of the advance; and (ii)

discontinue the proceeding and issue a costs award in its favour, if the Claimant failed to

offer a legitimate and compelling reason for its failure to pay its share of the advance.

On 26 June 2018, the Tribunal noted that neither Party had paid the requested advances. It
invited the Claimant to pay its share by 31 July 2018 and the Respondent to pay its share
by 10 August 2018.

On 2 August 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it would be able to pay by
15 September 2018 and requested an extension for making the advance payment until

30 September 2018.

On 3 August 2018, the Tribunal denied the Claimant’s request and informed the Parties
that given both Parties’ default, the Secretary-General would move to the Tribunal to stay

the proceeding pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d).

By letter of 13 August 2018, ICSID informed the Parties that the Tribunal had suspended
the proceeding pursuant to Regulation 14(3)(d) of ICSID Administrative and Financial

Regulation.

By letter of 24 January 2019, ICSID notified the Parties that the six-month period provided
in ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) in relation to the
discontinuation of proceedings would end on 13 February 2019 and invited the Parties to

pay the advance initially requested by the Centre on 6 April 2018.

By letter of 12 February 2019, the Claimant informed the Tribunal about its financial
situation and requested additional time to remit its share of the advance payment until 30

April 2019.

By letter of 14 February 2019, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal (i) deny the
Claimant’s request for a further extension; and (ii) issue an order discontinuing the
proceeding pursuant to Regulation 14(3)(d) of ICSID Administrative and Financial

Regulation.

By letter of 17 June 2019, the Tribunal sought the Parties’ agreement to hold the first
session together with the hearing on the Respondent’s Rule 41(5) Application, and
proposed dates for that session. The Tribunal further proposed to hold a pre-hearing
organizational meeting by telephone conference with the President alone, on the
understanding that any substantive decision would be discussed with and determined by
the full Tribunal. The Tribunal also circulated the Parties’ agreed comments on draft
Procedural Order No. | and invited the Parties (i) to review and confirm or amend the
comments on the draft Procedural Order; and (ii) to consult and agree, as far as possible,
on a procedural calendar in the event the Respondent’s Rule 41(5) Application would not

succeed.

By emails of 19 and 21 June 2019, the Claimant and the Respondent, respectively,

confirmed their availability on the dates proposed by the Tribunal.

On 27 June 2019, the Respondent filed its Updated Application under ICSID Arbitration
Rule 41(5) (“Updated Rule 41(5) Application”).

By letter of 2 July 2019, the Tribunal confirmed that the President alone would hold the
pre-hearing telephone conference with the Parties on 22 August 2019 and that the first
session and the hearing on the Respondent’s Rule 41(5) Application would take place on

17 September 2019, in Paris.

On | August 2019, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent’s Updated Rule 41(5)
Application (“Claimant’s Response to Updated Application”).

By email of the same day, the Claimant submitted the following documents:

1) Lotus Holding’s Renewed Petition to the Lotus Enerji Directorate seeking its
permission to request leave to add Lotus Proje Akaryakit Enerji Madencilik
Telekominikasyon Insaat Sanayi Taahhiit ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi (“Lotus Enerji’”)

as a co-claimant in this arbitration and its English translation;

2) Two documents submitted as Turkmenbashi Refinery’s Petition to the Directorate,
as an alleged creditor of Lotus Enerji, to exclude Lotus Holding’s counsel Egemenoglu
from representing it in the bankruptcy process and to deny Lotus Holding’s Renewed

Petition; and
3) English translations of the two documents contained in (2).

By email of the same day, the Respondent objected to the Claimant’s submission of new

documents and to the alleged mischaracterization of these documents by the Claimant.

By further email of the same date, the Claimant argued that ““Turkmenistan’s attempts to
thwart any action by Lotus Holding to bring Lotus Enerji into the mix continue” and it
reserved its right to seek a provisional measure barring Turkmenistan from interfering in
the Lotus Enerji bankruptcy, specifically with respect to the issues relating to the arbitration

process.

Also on 16 September 2019, the Respondent submitted a document which it claimed was
“an attachment to Claimant’s undated application to the Turkish Bankruptcy Directorate”

circulated by the Claimant earlier on the same day.

On 17 September 2019, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties and a hearing on
the Respondent’s Rule 41(5) Application at the offices of the World Bank in Paris (the

On 18 October 2019, the Tribunal declined to admit exhibit C-26 into the record at this

On 6 February 2020, the Respondent submitted a letter requesting leave to submit the
award in Almasryia for Operating & Maintaining Touristic Construction Co., LLC v. the
State of Kuwait, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/2, (“Almasryia v. Kuwait”), Award on the
Respondent’s Application under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules dated 1

November 2019, and its Dissenting Opinion.

On 12 February 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that “it has completed its
deliberations and intends to issue its ruling on the Respondent’s Rule 41(5) Application

shortly.” Accordingly, the Tribunal declined to accept the award in Almasryia v. Kuwait.

RELIEF SOUGHT
The Respondent’s Updated Rule 41(5) Application requests the Tribunal to:

DISMISS all the claims set forth in the Request for Arbitration in an Award issued
under ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(5) and 41(6), as the claims are manifestly without
legal merit.”

ORDER the Claimant “to pay all costs incurred by Respondent in connection with this
arbitration, including, but not limited to, legal fees and expenses, administrative costs
of ICSID, and any other reasonably incurred expenses.”?

The Claimant’s Response to Updated Rule 41(5) Application requests that the Tribunal
deny the Respondent’s Application and award the Claimant costs related to this phase of

the arbitration including, but not limited to, legal fees and other expenses.*

RELEVANT FACTS

Given the nature of proceedings under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), it is appropriate to
set out in full the Claimant’s own summary of the facts of the dispute contained in

paragraphs 17-27 of the Request for Arbitration (footnotes omitted):
B. Summary of Relevant Facts

17. Mr. Erdal Celik, the Chairman of Lotus Holding, has conducted
business in Turkmenistan starting from 1998. For the first 10 years
of his tenure in Turkmenistan, Mr. Celik worked as a General
Manager of Calik Enerji, a large Turkish energy and construction
company, which is currently doing business in Turkmenistan. Since
2007, as the Chairman of Lotus Holding and Lotus Enerji, he has
been involved in various large EPC Projects in Turkmenistan.

18. Since 2007, Lotus Holding, through its investment vehicle Lotus
Enerji, was awarded eight major industrial projects with a contract
value totaling about 1.5 billion USD. Lotus Enerji completed and
commissioned seven major industrial project contracts with success.

19. One of the projects was an investment embodied in Contract No.
MLO-I-L dated 03.01.2011 between Lotus Enerji and the Energy
Ministry of Turkmenistan whereby Lotus Energy was to perform
control-revision and construction-installation works for five
facilities (OHL-220kV ‘“Farap-Watan”, OHL-220kV “Serdar-
Farap”, OHL-SO0kV  “Mary-Des-Atamurat”, © OHL-500kV
“Atamurat-Afghanistan Border” and OHL-220kV ‘“Pelwert-
Atamurat”). The total contract price for these facilities was
325,000,000.00 USD.

20. Lotus Enerji completed the works required under these contracts
successfully and pursuant to a closeout agreement in 2016, between
itself and the Energy Ministry of Turkmenistan (as well as the
contract), is due 5 percent of the contract value as retention held by
the latter in the amount of 15,650,000.00 USD.

21. Lotus Enerji also signed the DCU & SDA Contract no. 41/1 IG

dated December 15, 2007 with the Turkmenbashy Refinery of

Turkmenistan, a state entity, as its eighth Contract in Turkmenistan.

Despite the delayed payments, and unexpected term extensions as

well as unilateral design changes made in contravention of the

parties’ agreement causing serious financial losses, Lotus Holding’s
12

investment vehicle, Lotus Enerji, worked harder in order to
complete the Project.

22. The changing economic conditions and the unstable actions by
the government caused the completion term to be extended for an
additional 40 months with no additional financial compensation to
Lotus Enerji. Despite the mentioned reasons as well as among others
(i.e., the Refinery making untimely revisions to design of the facility
and long-lead items to be manufactured for the facility at the
eleventh hour, thereby delaying the project), Lotus Enerji committed
to allocate its available resources to complete the Project to
Turkmenbashy Refinery’s satisfaction.

23. However, Refinery management unilaterally terminated the
Contract. Several major equipment was ordered, manufactured, and
shipped to the Refinery for which Lotus Enerji had paid in full or in
part. Lotus made significant payment to the manufacturers, incurred
tremendous losses for the completion of the aforementioned Project.
Consequently, Lotus Holding incurred damages of at least
35,000,000.00 Euros in termination costs as well as potential profit
that was not realized as a result of Turkmenistan's unjust termination
of Lotus Enerji. These losses are comprised of 1) unpaid amounts
due to Lotus Enerji for 3,576, 133.16 Euros for 5 percent of the Price
of Engineering Services and 10 percent of the Price of Construction
and Installation Works as mandated by the DCU & SDA Contract,
2) 12,521,564.74 Euros for payments made to vendors for project-
specific manufactured equipment which Lotus cannot now utilize
due to Lotus Enerji's termination and 3) 18,400,000.00 Euros for
loss of profit associated with the wrongful termination of Lotus
Enerji, plus interest for the above items.

24. Lotus Holding, through Lotus Enerji, further invested in
Turkmenistan through a 184,000,000.00 Euro turnkey agreement
with the Turkmen Ministry of Energy (Contract No. GT-7L) dated
19 April 2008 for the construction of the 254 MW Avaza Power
Plant and supply of power transmission and distribution in the
National Touristic Zone of Avaza.

25. While Lotus Enerji completed the project as required by the
above-mentioned turnkey agreement, Turkmenistan failed to make
the required payments, specifically the 5 percent retention it was
obligated to pay upon completion of the project. As such, Lotus
Holding is owed an additional 9.2 million Euros for non-payment of
the retention.

26. Lotus Holding is further owed additional amounts from two
agreements it entered into with state entities in Respondent's
territory. First was Contract No. JKT-02.05 dated 2 May 2008 with
The State Concern (Turkmengas) for the construction of a facility
for the refueling of vehicles with gasoline and compressed gas in
Ashgabat. The second was an agreement for the construction of a
power supply system for outdoor lighting of Archabil Shaloly and
Garashsyzlyk Shaloly in Ashgabat with Turkmenenergogurlushyk
dated 18 April 2008.

27. Respondent again failed to make required payments to Lotus
Enerji under the two agreements for 5,625,000.00 Euros and
2,650,000.00 Euros, respectively and therefore Claimant is owed
those amounts.

87. Thus, five contracts or agreements underlie this dispute. To summarize, for clarity, they

are:

- Contract No. MLO-1-L dated 1 March 2011, signed by Lotus Enerji and the Energy
Ministry of Turkmenistan, relating to control-revision and construction-installation
works for five facilities (Farap-Watan, Serdar-Farap, Mary-Des-Atamurat, Atamurat-

Afghanistan Border, and Pelwert-Atamurat);>

- DCU & SDA Contract No. 41/11G dated 15 December 2007, signed by Lotus Enerji
and the Turkmenbashy Refinery of Turkmenistan;°

- Contract No. GT-7L dated 8 April 2008, signed by Lotus Enerji and the Energy
Ministry of Turkmenistan, relating to the Avaza Power Plant;”

- Contract No. JKT-02.05 dated 2 May 2008, signed by Lotus Enerji and the State

Concern “Turkmengas”, relating to a refuelling facility in Ashgabat;*

- Contract dated 8 April 2008, signed by Lotus Enerji and the concern

88. It is also appropriate to set out in full the Claimant’s own description of the claims in this

case. This appears in paragraphs 80-82 of the Request for Arbitration:
D. DAMAGES

80. As a result of the above breaches of the BIT, the ECT, and
international legal obligations by Respondent, Claimant has
sustained losses (“damnum emergens”), including but not limited to
unpaid payments (including retention), loss of profits, monies paid
to third parties and not reimbursed by Respondent, loss of business
opportunities, and loss of enterprise value plus interest and costs
incurred in conjunction with these proceedings. Claimant’s losses
are being further analyzed, substantiated and quantified by forensic
experts and will be presented in due course on this arbitration. Some
of the non-exclusive damages incurred by Lotus holding are
summarized below.

E. RELIEF SOUGHT

82. The Claimant respectfully requests that the Arbitral Tribunal,
without prejudice to any other/further claims to which the Claimant
may be entitled, declare that Respondent has breached its
obligations toward Claimant under the ECT, the BIT, and customary
international law, and accordingly order the Respondent:

- to pay the Claimant damages equivalent to the financial loss and
damage, which Claimant has suffered as a result of Turkmenistan’s
breaches of the ECT, the Treaty, as well as of its obligations under
international law and the laws of Turkmenistan;

- to pay the Claimant damages arising out of the confiscation of its
assets by Turkmenistan;

- to pay all costs incurred in connection with these arbitration
proceedings;

- to pay interest, at a rate to be established, on the above amounts as
of the date these amounts are determined to have been due to the
Claimant; and

- to provide such other and further relief as the Arbitral Tribunal
shall deem appropriate.

89. On 21 April 2016, Lotus Enerji (not the Claimant Lotus Holding) sent what it describes as

a “final notification letter”! to the Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan.
90. On 24 November 2016, Lotus Enerji was declared bankrupt by the 1st Commercial Court

of First Instance in Ankara, Turkey.'! It is accepted by both Parties that Lotus Enerji

remains in bankruptcy proceedings and that the Turkish Bankruptcy Directorate currently

controls Lotus Enerji.!?

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

As to the procedural requirements for an application under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5),
the Respondent submits that it has complied with those requirements because no other
expedited procedure was agreed to by the Parties, and because its objections are timely.
The Respondent’s Rule 41(5) Application was filed within 30 days of the constitution of

the Tribunal, and well before the first session of the Tribunal.'?

The Respondent argues that its objections are appropriate for resolution under the
“manifest lack of legal merit” standard of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5). It submits that the

Claimant’s claims manifestly lack legal merit because:

i. The Claimant’s board resolutions were not sufficient to authorize it to pursue this

arbitration.

. The Claimant does not have independent claims. The Respondent emphasizes that
the contracts upon which the Claimant’s Request for Arbitration is based were not
signed by the Claimant, but by a separate entity, Lotus Enerji which is not before this
Tribunal;

iii.

Lotus Enerji is in bankruptcy proceedings under the control of the Turkish bankruptcy
authorities, and the Claimant has no authorization from that authority to pursue Lotus
Enerji’s claims; and

iv. The Claimant did not satisfy the requirements of Article VII of the BIT or the ECT.'*

In response to statements from the Claimant articulating its intention to add Lotus Enerji
as a “co-claimant” in this proceeding, the Respondent argues that the ICSID Arbitration
Rules do not allow joinder of a new “co-claimant” in cases such as this one, unless all the
parties consent to such joinder. Here, the Respondent has not consented to the addition of

a new “co-claimant.”!>

(LD) The legal standard of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5)

The Respondent relies on the summary dismissal procedure that is set forth in ICSID

Arbitration Rule 41(5),'° which provides as follows:

[A] party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the
Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal,
file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. The
party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the
objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to
present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session
or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the
objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to
the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or
to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal
merit.!7

The Respondent argues that ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) “allows the Tribunal, unlike
ICSID, to assess for itself whether dismissal is appropriate at the outset of the case, on
jurisdictional or merits grounds, without requiring the parties to go through the cost and

burden of years of arbitration proceedings.” '*

The Respondent relies on the following cases in setting out the legal standard to assess

whether a claim is manifestly without legal merit under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5):

Trans-Global v. Jordan — where the tribunal explained the legal standard as follows:

“these legal materials confirm that the ordinary meaning of the word requires the

respondent to establish its objection clearly and obviously, with relative ease and
dispatch. The standard is thus set high. Given the nature of investment disputes
generally, the Tribunal nonetheless recognizes that this exercise may not always be
simple, requiring (as in this case) successive rounds of written and oral submissions by

the Parties, together with questions addressed by the tribunal to those Parties. The

exercise may thus be complicated; but it should never be difficult.”!?

Brandes v. Venezuela — where the tribunal stated: “‘legal merit’ covers all objections

to the effect that the proceedings should be discontinued at an early stage because, for

whatever reason, the claim can manifestly not be granted by the Tribunal.”??

MOL v. Croatia — where the tribunal agreed with the approach adopted in Trans-Global
v. Jordan and further explained that ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) “envisages a claim
that is so obviously defective from a legal point of view that it can properly be

dismissed outright,” and a “clear-cut” objection that “could be decided virtually on the

papers or with a minimum of supplementary argument.””!

applicable BIT, [...] on the ground that the treaty did not provide for arbitration of

claims other than expropriation.”

97. The Respondent submits that, for purposes of an ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) application,
“a tribunal may assume at ‘face value’ the facts alleged by the Claimant; however, the
Tribunal should not accept factual allegations that are ‘incredible, frivolous, vexatious or

inaccurate or made in bad faith’ or ‘plainly without any foundation.’”?>

98. The Respondent further submits that, “[i]n deciding when a particular legal question is
suitable for determination on an expedited basis, the Global Trading v. Ukraine tribunal
considered whether the question at issue was settled enough from a legal perspective to
decide the matter under Rule 41(5).”?° The Respondent underlines that, “[i]t is well-settled

that objections under Rule 41(5) may pertain to either jurisdiction or the merits.”””

99. Based on the above, the Respondent concludes that its objections under ICSID Arbitration
Rule 41(5) “are appropriate for resolution under the ‘manifest lack of legal merit’ standard
of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5),” as they are “clear-cut and obvious and capable of being

established with ‘relative ease and dispatch.’”?*

valid authorization to initiate an ICSID arbitration at the time the Request for Arbitration
is filed. If the claimant is a company, as in this case, ICSID Institution Rule 2 requires that
the claimant present documentation to prove that the company ‘has taken all necessary

internal actions to authorize the request.’””?

According to the Respondent, the two powers of attorney*® provided by the Claimant with
the Request, were actually resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Claimant dated 15
June 2017 (a month prior to filing the Request for Arbitration). Both documents are signed
by Mr. Erdal Celik, who is listed as the “Chairman of the Board of Directors” of the

99932

Claimant,*! and is also “the only person listed under ‘Meeting Attendees. They are not

notarized as the Respondent submits would have been standard practice in Turkey.**

At the Hearing held on 17 September 2019, the Claimant presented a new power of attorney
dated 29 August 2019 which was issued by a public notary in Turkey (the “August 2019
POA”). According to the Claimant, the August 2019 POA authorized it to bring this
arbitration. However, in response to a question from the Tribunal, the Claimant admitted

that the August 2019 POA did not have retroactive effect.*#

By letter of 2 October 2019, the Claimant attempted to admit into the record another
notarized power of attorney which it argued did have retroactive effect under Turkish law.*>

document into the record.*© On 18 October 2019, the Tribunal decided not to admit the

new document into the record at this time.*”

Finally, the Respondent argues that even if there was a valid authorization for the Claimant
to initiate this arbitration, which it denies, the claims asserted by the Claimant “exceed the

scope of the resolution of Lotus Holding’s ‘board of directors.’”?*

b. The Claimant does not have independent claims

The Respondent describes this arbitration as involving claims arising under “five contracts
for the construction and installation of various facilities in Turkmenistan, entered into in
the period of 2007-2011.””? It underlines that the Claimant is not a signatory to any of these

contracts. The signatory of all them is Lotus Enerji, which is not a party to this arbitration.*°

Lotus Enerji is a fully-owned subsidiary of the Claimant, which is its sole shareholder. In
turn, Mr. Erdal Celik is the sole shareholder of the Claimant. Mr. Celik is also the Chairman

of both the Claimant and Lotus Enerji.*!

The Respondent submits that the Claimant “did not even exist at the time that Lotus Enerji
entered into four of the five contracts,” as it was only incorporated on 23 July 2008, after
the first four of the Contracts were already signed.*” Moreover, the Claimant never alleged
that Lotus Enerji had assigned “any of the contacts or rights thereunder to Lotus

Holding”?

The Respondent argues that the “Claimant has not asserted any independent claims for

damages other than the right to payment of the amounts due to Lotus Enerji under the five

a4 9945

Contracts,”** and that the Claimant’s claims are “expressly pleaded contract claims.

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant’s arguments that “Lotus Enerji itself and
‘its claims to money’ qualify as the Claimant’s ‘investment’ under Article 1(6) of the
ECT,” are “untenable.”*° According to the Respondent, “Article 1(6) of the ECT clearly
mandates that the investment be ‘owned or controlled’ by the investor.”*’ Since Lotus
Enerji has been under the sole control of the Turkish Bankruptcy authorities since
November 2016, i.e., eight months before the Claimant filed the Request for Arbitration,
the “Claimant does not ‘own or control’ either Lotus Enerji itself, or the claims to money

supposedly owed to [it], which belong to its bankruptcy estate.”**

The Respondent also argues that the Claimant does not have legal standing to make claims
for the contracts and assets of Lotus Enerji, in which it is a shareholder. According to the
Respondent “[i]t is a fundamental principle universally recognised by international
authorities that a shareholder does not have legal standing to make claims for the contracts

and assets of the company in which it is a shareholder.”*”

The Respondent makes a distinction between “‘shareholders’ property” and the “company’s
property,” and cites Prof. Zachary Douglas to support its position that an international
tribunal cannot “wholly discard the basic distinction between the shareholder’s property
and the company’s property merely because the cause of action arises in international law”

and that a shareholder that “benefits from the separate legal personality and limited liability

must accept the inconveniences as well as the advantages.”*° The Respondent argues that

the assets belong to the company, not to the shareholders.*!

112. In response to the Claimant’s argument that the claimed money “would have been paid as
‘dividends’ to Claimant, and that dividends qualify as an ‘investment’ under Article 1 of

the BIT,”*? the Respondent argues that this is manifestly flawed for several reasons:

First, [Claimant] and Lotus Enerji are separately incorporated,
distinct entities. Claimant does not have the authority to speak on
behalf of Lotus Enerji as to what it ‘would have’ done with its
receivables ... This argument presumes that a company that was
engaging in multiple construction projects would not need or use
any of the money it was being paid under the contracts for those
projects to actually carry out the works. That view is completely
divorced from reality.

[Second], [i]n order to pay dividends, a company must have profits
remaining after having satisfied its liabilities and expenses incurred
in the ordinary course of conducting its business operations ...
which is expressly required under the Turkish Commercial Code. ...
Thus, the premise of Claimant’s ‘would-be dividends’ argument is
fundamentally flawed.

Moreover, Claimant’s argument would require the Tribunal to make
a determination regarding the financial status of Lotus Enerji during
the relevant period, a party that is not before it, that is not
represented by any authorized representative in this arbitration, that
cannot speak for itself and cannot submit its own evidence. Yet the
Tribunal would have to make an assessment of Lotus Enerji’s assets
and liabilities, and, in order to do so, evaluate and determine the
many pending claims of creditors and other obligations, which are
currently subject to determination by the Turkish bankruptcy

authorities in its liquidation proceedings. This exercise would not
only be improper, but also impossible ...

[Fourth], Claimant’s argument essentially would require the
Tribunal to essentially adjudicate multiple disputes between the
bankrupt entity and its creditors, which are pending in the
bankruptcy proceeding, before it could determine Claimant’s claim
that dividends would have been available for distribution to [the
Claimant] ... Neither Lotus Enerji nor its creditors have consented
to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.*?

c. The Claimant has no authorization from the Turkish bankruptcy authorities to
pursue Lotus Enerji’s claims in this arbitration

113. The Respondent underlines that Lotus Enerji is “in liquidation proceedings in Turkey,
having been declared bankrupt and put under the supervision and control of the Turkish
bankruptcy authorities in November 2016.”>+ The Respondent submits that “[c]laims for
money owed to a bankrupt company belong to its bankruptcy estate and can only be
pursued by the proper party, with the authorization of the Turkish bankruptcy authorities,

in accordance with the requirements of Turkish law, and are payable only to the bankruptcy

estate.”°>

114. According to the Respondent, under Turkish bankruptcy law:

[T]he only proper way for Claimant to receive any recovery, based
on its status as a shareholder of the bankrupt entity, of amounts
allegedly due to the bankrupt entity under its contracts, is through
the Turkish bankruptcy proceedings. That would occur only after
the Bankruptcy Directorate administers the estate, determines and
makes distributions due to Lotus Enerji’s creditors, and determines
any residual assets remaining in the estate which could be
distributed to a shareholder such as Claimant. Maintaining itself as
a claimant or co-claimant in this arbitration does not allow [the
Claimant] to escape or alter the proper procedures for obtaining a

recovery as a shareholder of Lotus Enerji under Turkish bankruptcy
law, nor does it improve its position in that process.*°

Such authorization, it submits, “would require an actual, notarized power of attorney from
the Turkish Bankruptcy Directorate, expressly appointing counsel to act on behalf of the
bankrupt entity, Lotus Enerji, to pursue its claims in this case and collect its receivables for

the bankruptcy estate.”*”

The Respondent argues that the Claimant has no authorization from the Turkish bankruptcy
authorities to pursue the claims of Lotus Enerji in this arbitration, and no such authorization
has been presented in this case.** It contrasts this with what happened in the Muhammet
Cap & Bankrupt Sehil v. Turkmenistan case where express authorization had been given
by the Turkish bankruptcy authorities for bankrupt Sehil to pursue its claims against

Turkmenistan in that arbitration.”

Based on the above, the Respondent argues that “[t]he only conclusion that can be reached
is that Claimant is pursuing a strategy to avoid the scrutiny of the Turkish Bankruptcy
Directorate supervising Lotus Enerji’s liquidation proceeding, and to avoid Lotus Enerji’s
creditors, by ensuring that proceeds of claims under Lotus Enerji’s Contracts are not paid
to the bankruptcy estate, but to [the Claimant] and thereby, to the latter’s sole shareholder,
Mr. [C]elik.”® The Respondent submits that “an attempt to bypass the creditors of an entity

in bankruptcy would be illegal, invalid, and even possibly criminal, under Turkish law.”°!

The Respondent underlines that Mr. Celik obviously knew that Lotus Enerji was in

bankruptcy proceedings when he signed the resolutions. For the Respondent, the

Claimant filed the Request for Arbitration in its name to “[avoid] creditors in the

bankruptcy proceeding,” and to “avoid liability on potential counterclaims against Lotus

Enerji.”®* The Respondent thus concludes that “there is an abuse of process in this

arbitration.”

d. The Claimant failed to fulfil the requirements of the BIT and the ECT

The Respondent submits that:

Under Article VII (1)-(2) of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT, an
investor must give written notice of a dispute to the State with
‘detailed information’ concerning the claims, and it must allow a
six-month period for the parties to engage in negotiations to attempt
to reach an amicable settlement of the identified dispute. The BIT
also requires the investor to submit the disputes to domestic courts,
and to allow a one-year period for the courts to issue a decision.
Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty also requires an investor to
attempt amicable settlement of disputes with a host State, including
a three-month “cooling off” period.®

The Respondent argues that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the Claimant’s claims
because the Claimant failed to satisfy the requirements of Article VII of the BIT and Article
26 (1)-(2) of the ECT.
(i) The Claimant failed to comply with the notice requirements of Article VII of
the BIT and Article 26 of the ECT
The Respondent submits that the allegation by the Claimant that it satisfied the notice

requirements of Article VII of the BIT is “manifestly incorrect,” and that the documents”

that the Claimant relies on fail to satisfy such requirements.

122. The Respondent argues that “[t]he importance of providing sufficient notice has been
widely recognized by ICSID tribunals.” It lists several ICSID cases including, inter alia,

Western NIS v. Ukraine, Goetz v. Burundi, Burlington Resources v. Ecuador and

  

Supervision v. Costa Rica as examples. For the Respondent, the Claimant failed to satisfy

the notice requirements of the BIT and the ECT because:

Lotus Enerji, not Lotus Holding, sent those communications; the
communications only referred to one of the Contracts; they failed to
mention the BIT or the ECT and they do not actually refer to
arbitration. Similarly, the “draft arbitration request” sent to the
Ministry of Energy of Turkmenistan via email on February 1, 2017
does not satisfy these requirements. It did not refer to the five
Contracts or the ECT, and claimant initiated this arbitration before
the six-month period elapsed.””

123. The Respondent argues that the Claimant also failed to observe the six-month waiting
period for the Parties to engage in negotiations to attempt to reach an amicable settlement
of the dispute as mandated by the BIT, and the three-month cooling off period contained

in Article 26 of the ECT.”

(ii) The Claimant failed to comply with Article VII (2) of the BIT

124. The Respondent points out that the Claimant does not deny that it failed to comply with
Article VII (2) of the BIT, whereby an investor must submit its dispute to the national

courts of the host State before commencing international arbitration and allow a one-year

period for the courts to render a decision. Instead, the Claimant submits that this provision

is not mandatory.’”

The Respondent supports its position by relying on Kilig v. Turkmenistan” and I¢kale v.
Turkmenistan,” where those tribunals “found the language in Article VII (2) of the Turkey-
Turkmenistan BIT to contain mandatory language requiring submission to local courts

before international arbitration may be commenced.””°

e. The Claimant’s intention to add Lotus Enerji as a “co-claimant”

The Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot simply join a new co-claimant to the
proceeding under the ICSID Arbitration Rules and emphasizes that the Claimant “has not
provided any basis or authority permitting joinder.””° The Respondent argues that “there
is no provision in the ICSID Rules that allows for joinder of a third party to an arbitration
proceeding after it has been commenced,” and in a few cases on this issue, “tribunals have
held that joinder of a new party could only occur with the consent of all parties to the

arbitration.””’ In the present case, the Respondent has not given its consent.
The Respondent relies on the following cases:

Churchill v. Indonesia” — The tribunal explained that “[p]ursuant to Article 36(2) of
the ICSID Convention and ICSID Institutional Rule 2(1), the request for arbitration
must identify each party to the proceedings with precision and indicate the date and the

instrument by which each has given its consent to arbitration. Thereafter, no new

party can be added except if all the others agree to its joinder ...””

Continental Casualty v. Argentina®® — The tribunal rejected the claimant’s application
to join its subsidiary as a claimant because it found that Article 46 of the ICSID

Convention does not allow “the introduction into that arbitration of an additional third

person with its own new claim.”*!

Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina®’ — The tribunal stated that “[tJhere can be no doubt that

such an ex post joinder or consolidation of proceedings is subject to a specific consent

of the Parties.”*°

128. In conclusion, because the Respondent does not consent to the joinder of Lotus Enerji in

this proceeding,** it cannot be joined as a “co-claimant” in this arbitration.*°

(3) The Claimant’s allegations of the Respondent’s bad faith

129. The Respondent notes that the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s Application, as well

as its opposition to the joinder of Lotus Enerji constitute “bad faith” attempts to prevent

the Claimant or Lotus Enerji from “‘vindication’ of their rights.”*°

The Respondent argues that “Claimant’s accusations of ‘bad faith’ ring hollow. It is
Claimant who has sought to abuse this ICSID arbitration, circumvent the Turkish
bankruptcy proceedings, and avoid the rights of Lotus Enerji’s creditors. Claimant is in no

position to accuse others of ‘bad faith,’ and there is no merit to that charge.”*’

THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

The Claimant contends that the Respondent’s Application should be denied because:

i. The Claimant was duly authorized to file this arbitration;
ii. The claims brought in this arbitration belong to the Claimant regardless of the status
of Lotus Enerji;**
iii. The Claimant has satisfied the requirements of Article VII of the BIT and the
provisions of the ECT;®? and
iv. Lotus Enerji can be added to this proceeding as a co-claimant and doing so would not

affect the Claimant’s claims as asserted in this arbitration.°

Finally, it should be noted, at the outset, that the Claimant does not dispute the
Respondent’s submissions as to the legal standard of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5).°! The
Claimant does, however, disagree with the application of that standard and argues that this

is not a case that should be dismissed on the basis of Rule 41(5).°

(LD) The Claimant was duly authorized to file this arbitration

The Claimant argues that the two board resolutions that it submitted together with the

Request, authorizing the firms Butzel Long and Egemenoglu to represent it in this

proceeding fulfil the formal requirements for filing an ICSID request for arbitration as they

were signed by the Claimant’s sole board member, Mr. Erdal Celik.”

The Claimant argues that there is no requirement under the ICSID Arbitration Rules that
powers of attorney be notarized.** The Claimant stresses that after the Request was
registered, the Respondent “acknowledged Claimant’s counsel as duly-appointed
representatives and even issued a visa (and instructed its counsel in obtaining such visa) to
Messrs. Alcitepe and Egemenoglu in order to travel to Turkmenistan and discuss issues
related to [Claimant’s] claim with representatives of Turkmenistan, including its

counsel.”*°

In its Response to the Respondent’s Updated Rule 41(5) Application, the Claimant added
that “should the Tribunal so decide that a notarized power of attorney is required [it] will
obtain a notarized version of its board resolution authorizing its counsel to initiate this

arbitration and represent it in these proceedings.”*°

At the Hearing, the Claimant introduced a notarized Turkish language power of attorney
into the record, a copy and English translation of which was transmitted to the Tribunal on

18 September 2019.°”

Following questions from the Tribunal at the Hearing as to whether the document had a
retroactive effect, the Claimant sought to submit a further notarized power of attorney into
the record by letter dated 2 October 2019. The Claimant argued that this document has
“retroactive effect” under Turkish law authorizing counsel to file its ICSID claim against

the Respondent.”*

The Respondent objected to the admission of this document into the record on 16 October

(2) The Claimant’s claims in this arbitration belong to the Claimant

The Claimant’s position is that “Lotus Holding suffered, in addition to the loss of its
monetary claims held through Lotus Enerji, the complete destruction of the value of its
shareholding in Lotus Enerji and is fully authorized under international investment law to

bring claims in these regards.”!°

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant’s claims should have
been asserted by Lotus Enerji because it (not the Claimant) was a party to the contracts at
issue in this arbitration. According to the Claimant, the Respondent “ignores the plain
language of both the BIT and the ECT, as well as many cases in which a parent company
was allowed to bring claims against a respondent in order to recover its own losses.”!°!
The Claimant also argues that Lotus Enerji was one of the Claimant’s “investment

vehicles.”!”

The Claimant’s position is that the plain language of both the BIT and the ECT clearly
allow it “to claim damages against Respondent for losses arising out of monies not paid by
Respondent on the contracts to which its fully-owned subsidiary was a party.” !°? It clarifies

that it is not seeking damages for breach of contract but for violations of the ECT and the

BIT.' It adds that “[i]t is well-established the same facts can form the basis both for the

subsidiary’s breach of contract claim and the parent/investor’s treaty claim.”!°°

142. According to the Claimant, the ECT’s definition of investment covers “[...] every kind of
asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes [...] (b) [a]
company or business enterprise, or shares, stocks or other forms of equity participation in
a company or business enterprise [...]” as well as “(c) [c]laims to money and claims to
performance pursuant to a contract having an economic value and associated with an

Investment.”!°° The Claimant argues that its investments fall under these categories.

143. The Claimant also argues that Article I(2)(i-ii) and (3) of the BIT protect “‘any form of

participation,’ not only ownership of shares” and also “explicitly protects the investor’s

right to dividends in its definition of ‘returns.’”!°7

104 Claimant’s Rejoinder, para. 11. The Claimant also states: “While the RFA asserts that Respondent’s actions
constitute both a breach of its contracts with Lotus Enerji and violations of the ECT and BIT, the RFA seeks a remedy
only for the treaty violations, not the contract breaches. In particular, Claimant will seek a remedy for the following
violations of the BIT and the ECT: a. Depriving Claimant of dividends it would otherwise have received from Lotus
Enerji had Respondent not refused to make payments due to Lotus Enerji and not unjustly and improperly terminated
contracts with Lotus Enerji; b. Expropriating Claimant's investment by improperly and unjustly forcing Lotus Enerji
into bankruptcy; c. Forcing Claimant to spend millions of dollars — including making payments to Lotus Enerji’s
creditors and employees — to keep Lotus Enerji afloat; and d. Depriving Claimant of its right [to] make further
investments in Lotus Enerji or other busi 's with dividends for (a) or funds it had to spend on (c), above.”

144. The Claimant cites several cases'®* to demonstrate that “a parent company and/or a

145. Further, in response to the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant’s claims as articulated
in its Request for Arbitration are different from the measure of damages requested in later
pleadings, the Claimant argues that, “when filing the Request for Arbitration, [it] expressly
‘reserve[d] the right to substantiate, amend and supplement’ its damages as well as adding
‘interests, costs and amounts associated with the loss of business opportunities and loss of
enterprise value.’ Indeed, it is standard practice in international arbitration to provide a full
quantification of the damages following the Request for Arbitration.”!!° The Claimant
further contends that ICSID Arbitration Rule 40 also allows for the amendment of such

claims.'"!

146. The Claimant also rejects the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant is seeking “double
recovery.”'!? The Claimant argues that it is “nothing more than a false dilemma
Respondent has raised in an effort to deprive Claimant of its rights under the BIT and

government of Turkmenistan have sufficient resources to be able to protect against the
spectre of ‘double recovery’ or of interfering with creditors’ rights without depriving the

foreign investor of its rights.”!!>

Finally, the Claimant also submits that its “claims in this arbitration would not circumvent
the creditors of Lotus Enerji because Claimant asserts only those claims that it is legally
entitled to bring in its own name.”!!® Therefore, it argues, “since these rights belong to

Claimant, there is no need to seek the trustee’s permission to pursue them.”!!7

(3) The Claimant has satisfied the requirements of Article VII of the BIT and of the
ECT

a. The Claimant has satisfied the notice requirements of Article VII of the BIT and
the ECT

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s objection on the basis that it failed to satisfy the
notice requirements of the BIT and the ECT. According to the Claimant, the Respondent
“ignores both key pieces of evidence as well as well-established law on the issue.”!'® The

key pieces of evidence that the Claimant refers to are:

- the letter of notification dated 21 April 2016 where the Claimant mentioned the
possibility of taking the dispute to “international third parties;” and

- the email of a draft request for arbitration sent to the Ministry of Energy of
Turkmenistan and the Turkmenistan Refinery on | February 2017, “outlin[ing] the

treaty claims” and “requesting that the matter be resolved amicably.”!!?

The Claimant argues that it satisfied the six-month notice period of the BIT and recalls

that:

- On21 April 2016, the Respondent was notified of the dispute related to the Refinery

- On 1 February 2017, Turkmenistan received a draft request for arbitration

Turkmenistan;

- On 28 July 2017, the Claimant filed the Request for Arbitration; and
- The Request for Arbitration was registered on 22 August 2017.!2°

150. | The Claimant argues that it filed the Request for Arbitration four days shy of the six-month
period starting from the draft request for arbitration, and that the Request was not registered
until 22 August 2017, well after the six months had elapsed. 121 Moreover, the Claimant
argues that it satisfied the requirement of the ECT, as the “ECT proposes only that the
Claimant requested ‘amicable settlement’ of the dispute at least three months prior to the

commencement of arbitration.” !”?

151. Finally, the Claimant argues that even if the six-month period had not elapsed, “Respondent
has provided no evidence at all as to what actions it would have taken in those four days to

14 the

promote settlement of the dispute.”!?> Relying on the Occidental v. Ecuador case,
Claimant submits that “[a] number of tribunals have confirmed that where negotiations are

bound to be futile, there is no need for the waiting period to have fully lapsed.” !?°

b. The Claimant also satisfied the other requirements of the BIT and the ECT

152. The Claimant submits that Article VII (2) of the BIT is not a jurisdictional bar to its

claims. !7°

153. | According to the Claimant, tribunals have allowed claimants to pursue their treaty claims
under the BIT despite not initially filing to litigate domestically in Turkmen courts.!2” The

Claimant’s position in this arbitration is that:

... the Treaty does not require claimants to first file for litigation in
Turkmen courts. This view was adopted by the tribunal in its
Decision on Jurisdiction dated February 13, 2015 in Muhammet Cap
& Sehil Insaat Endustri ve Ticaret Ltd. Sti. v. Turkmenistan (ICSID
Case No. ARB 12/6). Lotus will provide factual and anecdotal
evidence, similar to Sehil, regarding the legislative intent of the
Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT in support of the position that the one-
year resort to litigation requirement is not imposed by the BIT.

Should the tribunal find that the requirement does exist, Lotus will
argue that 1) the MFN clause of the BIT allows Lotus to circumvent
the requirement; 2) submission of the dispute to Turkmen courts
would have been futile and; 3) while not initiated by Lotus, local
court proceedings have indeed been conducted in the context of the
present dispute. The tribunal in Ickale Insaat Limited Sirketi v.
Turkmenistan, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/24, in its Award dated
March 8, 2016, found that because Turkmenistan had conducted
legal proceedings in Turkmen courts against claimant with respect
to the latter's claims, even though these proceedings were not
initiated by the claimant, this was sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of Article VII (2) of the of BIT.!78

c. The Claimant’s intention to add Lotus Enerji as a “co-claimant”

154. Finally, in the Claimant’s Response to the Respondent’s Updated Application, the

Claimant asserts that the possible addition of Lotus Enerji as a co-claimant would not have

any impact on the Claimant’s claims in this arbitration, as the Claimant has “separate and

independent claims, distinct from those of Lotus Enerji.”!??

The Claimant submits that there has been no formal petition to add Lotus Enerji as a co-
claimant in this proceeding, and therefore, that the issue is “not yet ripe for briefing.”!*°
However, even if it were ripe for briefing, the Claimant’s position is that “[t]here is nothing

in the ICSID Rules that prohibit the addition of a co-claimant.”'*!

TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

SUMMARY DISMISSAL UNDER RULE 41(5)

ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) provides a procedure for the summary dismissal of claims at
a very early stage. A party “may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal,
and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is
manifestly without legal merit.” The timing is significant. It necessarily means that the
application must be made before the timetable for the submission of pleadings has been set
down, and therefore when the only available statement of the case is that set out in the
Request for Arbitration. It is on the basis of the Request that the application under ICSID

Arbitration Rule 41(5) is made and the tribunal must decide.

The wording of Rule 41(5) is clear. The respondent must show that “a claim” is “manifestly
without legal merit.” As Rule 41(6) makes clear, if all claims are to be dismissed, all must

be shown to be manifestly without legal merit.'37

The consequence of a summary dismissal under Rule 41(5) is that the claim set out in the

request for arbitration proceeds no further. The tribunal rules, in effect, that there is no

point in proceeding with the claim because it cannot succeed: no matter what evidence is
adduced, there is a fundamental flaw in the way that the claim is formulated that must
inevitably lead to its dismissal. The inevitability of dismissal must be manifest. It must be
obvious from the submissions of the parties that there is some unavoidable and indisputable
fact, or some legal objection in relation to which no possible counter-argument is identified.
Tf the claimant, in its submissions under Rule 41(5), can point to an arguable case, the claim
should proceed: but if the tribunal is satisfied than no such arguable case has been
identified, it is in accordance with the sound administration of justice that the claim should

be halted and dismissed at that point.

The procedure under Rule 41(5) serves the interests of the efficient administration of justice
and the interests of both parties in a case. Dismissal of a claim saves the claimant expending
time and resources on the pursuit of a claim that cannot succeed, and it saves the respondent
expending time and resources in defending a claim that is so manifestly and fundamentally

defective that it calls for no further defence before it is dismissed.

A tribunal’s judgment on a Rule 41(5) application must be practical. While there is perhaps
always a theoretical possibility that well-established legal rules and principles could be
overturned or not applied in a particular case, a claimant would have to show why it is
credible that such a theoretical possibility might operate in the instant case. A tribunal must
be able to regard some legal rules and principles as so firmly established that they can serve
as premises on the basis of which it can properly conclude that a particular claim will

inevitably fail. If that were not the case, Rule 41(5) would be emptied of practical effect.

The Claimant argued at one point that the motives of a respondent in making an application
under Rule 41(5) are relevant. It said that because the Respondent is a creditor in the
bankruptcy process of Lotus Enerji (in fact, “by far the largest creditor, or alleged creditor,

of Lotus Enerji’”)'**, there is “an inherent conflict of interest.” !*4

165.

In the view of the Tribunal, even if the motive of an applicant is relevant to consideration
of an application under Rule 41(5) (which the Tribunal does not decide), it cannot be
improper for a party to seek to protect its own interests in the litigation.!*° The Tribunal

finds no evidence of any improper motive on the part of either Party in this case.

With these preliminary remarks made, the analysis in this case must begin by identifying

“the claims.”

THE RELEVANT TIME FOR ASSESSING “THE CLAIMS”

As was noted above, it is evident that “‘a claim” can only be defined by reference to the
Request for Arbitration. This accords with legal principle. Questions relating to the
jurisdiction of a tribunal are judged as at the moment at which the claim is filed with a
tribunal, and the Tribunal considers that the same principle is applicable to the question
whether a claim is manifestly without legal merit, arising under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules, because dismissal on that ground is in essence a determination that the
claim put before the tribunal is, whatever the evidence or arguments that might be adduced

in support of it, not one on which the tribunal could possibly rule in favour of the claimant.

'36 it follows from that

Subject to what is said below about the amendment of a claim,
principle that both the claim and the facts must be appraised as they stood at the relevant
time. There might be argument as to whether the relevant date in this case is the date of the
communication of the Request for Arbitration to ICSID (here, 28 July 2017), or the date
on which ICSID registers the request (22 August 2017), or the date on which the Tribunal
is constituted (5 April 2018), or the date on which the Rule 41(5) application is received
from the Respondent (4 May 2018). In the present case, however, the Tribunal is satisfied

that there is no material change in the position between the first and last of those dates. It

135 Claimant itself says, albeit in a slightly different context, “... I commend Respondent's counsel for this, they are
representing their client, but the objective is to shield Turkmenistan from liability from any entity at any point at all
costs”: Transcript, p. 151, Il. 14-18.

136 See paras. 190-194.

therefore refers for convenience to the Request for Arbitration as the definitive statement

of the claim.

Cc. “THE CLAIMS” IN THE PRESENT CASE

166. The Request for Arbitration in this case presents claims by Lotus Holding, and explicitly
identifies Lotus Holding as “the Claimant.” It is not disputed that Lotus Holding is the sole

Claimant in this case.

167. The claims presented are for damages in respect of injuries said to have been caused to
Lotus Holding by the Respondent. The Request for Arbitration identifies “Turkmenistan’s
breaches of its obligations under international law.”'5” In paragraph 60 of the Request for

Arbitration, the Claimant says that:

Turkmenistan’s unlawful measures including, but not limited to,
withholding of monies due to Lotus Holding, actions to sabotage
Lotus Holding’s investment vehicle Lotus Enerji’s performance,
unlawful seizure of various projects without full payment and
without the consent of Lotus Holding and/or Lotus Enerji, and the
unjust termination of Lotus Enerji from the DCU & SDA
Agreement, among other things, constituted violations of the
guarantee of a minimum standard of treatment.

168. In paragraph 61 of the Request for Arbitration, the Claimant says that:

This very same factual matrix ipso facto is a breach of
Turkmenistan’s substantive obligations under the BIT. The
measures of Turkmenistan including, but not limited to, the
unlawful failure to make payments due under the various projects,
unlawful withholding of the retention amount under the various
Agreements, and illegal seizure of the various project premises
without the consent of Lotus Holding and/or Lotus Enerji are
unlawful measures attributable to Turkmenistan. By enforcing these
unlawful measures, Turkmenistan violated several of its obligations
under the BIT. The violations include, but are not limited to the
following ...

'57 That is the title of section 5 of the Request.

42

169.

170.

171.

The Request for Arbitration goes on to list the provisions said to have been violated. They
include the duty not to discriminate, the MFN clause, the ‘umbrella clause,’ the national
treatment standard, the duty not to discriminate, and the duty not to expropriate, all under
the BIT, and the fair and equitable treatment and the duty not to expropriate, under the

ECT.

The Tribunal considers it to be abundantly clear, from the written and oral submissions

made in this case, !*8

that the claims in the present case are for monies owed under the five
contracts identified in paragraph 87 above, and for alleged associated losses. The Request
for Arbitration refers repeatedly to the Respondent’s alleged failures to make payments

139

due under the contracts, '*’ and there is no claim articulated in the Request for Arbitration

that is distinct from those allegations.

The nature of a contractual claim cannot be altered merely by describing it in different
terms. To suggest that non-payment of sums due under a contract in itself constitutes
expropriation, 4° or a breach of MEN or national treatment clauses, '*! does not alter the
fact that the claim remains one for non-payment under a contract. That is not to say that
non-payment can never constitute a breach of a treaty standard. In some circumstances, it
may do so: but the argument must be properly pleaded out, and it must be explained why,
for example, the non-payment is considered to be expropriatory or discriminatory and what
facts support that submission. If it is not properly pleaded out, a respondent cannot know
what the allegation made against it is, and a tribunal cannot satisfy itself that the matter is
within its jurisdiction and is admissible. In the present case, the Request for Arbitration
provides no explanation of why the alleged contractual breaches should, or could, be

considered to be, in themselves, breaches of the BIT and/or the ECT.

138 Including the letters sent by Lotus Enerji to the Cabinet of Ministers in Turkmenistan, on 20 November 2015 and
21 April 2015, and 19 November 2015, annexed to the Request for Arbitration as Annex 1, and the Board of Directors
Resolutions of Lotus Holding Anonim Sirketi, dated 15 June 2017, authorizing these proceedings, annexed to the
Request for Arbitration as Annex 5.

question.

“THE CLAIMS” RELATE TO RIGHTS OF LOTUS ENERJI, NOT OF THE
CLAIMANT
The difficulties facing Lotus Holding, as the only Claimant in this case, are that it is not a
party to any of the contracts in question here, and that it has not articulated in its Request
for Arbitration a claim that the Respondent’s dealings with Lotus Enerji have violated
rights held by Lotus Holding under the BIT and/or the ECT. All of the contracts were
concluded by Lotus Enerji. The “monies due to Lotus Holding” are, under those contracts,
monies due to Lotus Enerji. Lotus Holding had no more than the expectation or hope of
receiving some benefits, in its capacity as shareholder of Lotus Enerji, from any monies

received under those contracts by Lotus Enerji, e.g. in the form of dividends.

It is common ground that Lotus Enerji is not a party to the present proceedings, and that
(quite apart from the question of the need for the consent of the Respondent in this case)!4?
the leave of the Turkish Bankruptcy Directorate would be necessary to make it a party, and
that such leave has not been given at this time.'** Indeed, no application has been made to

the Tribunal to add Lotus Enerji as a party to this case.

Parties to arbitral proceedings can only make claims in respect of their own rights. That is
axiomatic, and inherent in the very concept of the status of a ‘party’ to proceedings. To
find a claim under the BIT or the ECT, the rights and “assets” protected by the treaties,
including the “claims to money” referred to in Article 1 of the ECT and Article 1 of the
BIT, must be the rights and assets of the Claimant. The rights and claims to money in this

case, however, do not belong to the Claimant, but to Lotus Enerji.

Lotus Holding is a corporate entity whose legal separateness from Lotus Enerji is
undisputed. In the same way that Lotus Holding can point to its legal independence of

Lotus Enerji when questions of responsibility for the debts of Lotus Enerji are in question,

A point discussed extensively in the Parties’ respective submissions. The Tribunal does not need to decide on this

48 Transcript, p. 16, Il. 3-22.

44

176.

177.

178.

it must accept the consequences of that independence when the enforcement of Lotus

Enerji’s rights is in question.

The Request for Arbitration offers no indication of why the Claimant considers that the
alleged breaches of Lotus Enerji’s contractual obligations amount to breaches of the
Claimant’s rights under the BIT and/or the ECT. They are referred to as breaches of the
Respondent’s international law obligations: but no explanation is offered of why the
alleged breaches of contract should be considered to violate the Respondent’s obligations
towards the Claimant under international law, and the Claimant has not alleged any facts
connecting the Respondent’s alleged breaches of contract with the alleged breaches of the
treaties. For example, there is no indication of any facts that might support an allegation —
much less, might support a finding — that the non-payment of sums due under the contracts

was discriminatory and in breach of the obligation of national treatment.

The Claimant asserts in the Request that it “owns and controls, through Lotus Enerji, the
agreement for the constructions projects ... and all claims to monies arising out of those

144

contracts. The suggestion is that wrongs done to Lotus Enerji are in some way

actionable by Lotus Holding. That is, however, incorrect.

The Claimant’s ‘ownership’ interest in the contracts has at all material times, from the time
that the contracts were concluded through to the present day, consisted in no more than the
rights that it has as a shareholder in respect of any dividends or residual assets of what is
now the bankrupt company, Lotus Enerji. That is a contingent interest, now dependent
upon there being assets remaining for distribution once all of Lotus Enerji’s creditors have
been satisfied. There is no suggestion that the Claimant had or has any legal entitlement to
any specific assets of Lotus Enerji. Nor is there any suggestion that the Claimant had or
has the right to pursue actions in the name of or on behalf of Lotus Enerji, or that it had or

has any proprietary rights, aside from those implicit in the bankruptcy process, in respect

'4 Request for Arbitration, para. 42.

45

179.

180.

181.

145

of any assets of Lotus Enerji. Lotus Holding and Lotus Enerji cannot be treated as one and

the same company.

The ‘control’ that the Claimant was able to exercise over Lotus Enerji when Lotus Enerji
was established, does not alter the position. It was not control over the project contracts or
the monies due under them. It may be that the Claimant could have used its control so as
to institute proceedings in the name of Lotus Enerji; but its control could not transform
wrongs done to Lotus Enerji into wrongs done to the Claimant itself. And at the present
time, as the Claimant concedes, Lotus Enerji is under the control of the Turkish Bankruptcy

Directorate, although the Claimant says that “the ownership is still with Lotus Holding.” '>

The Tribunal considers, following the language of the tribunal in Enkev Beheer BV v.
Poland,'*® that the Claimant, Lotus Holding, cannot stand in the shoes of its subsidiary
Lotus Enerji and make claims on its subsidiary’s behalf for harm suffered directly by its
subsidiary. Claimant must allege a violation of its own rights under the BIT and/or the
ECT. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that “even assuming all facts asserted in
the application in the Request for Arbitration at face value, an award from this tribunal on
liability under the contracts could not be made in favour of and payable to Lotus

Holding.”'!47

LOTUS HOLDING’S “OWN CLAIMS”

The Claimant argues that the case law establishes that:

Either the parent companies or shareholders of companies that were
aggrieved by the state through a contract or expropriation have the
right to bring their own claims in a treaty, in a bilateral investment

Although Claimant says that “the ownership is still with Lotus Holding”: Transcript, p. 140, Il. 19-25. As has been

explained, Claimant’s ‘ownership’ interest in Lotus Enerji extends to rights or assets protected under the BIT or the

ECT.

treaty or multilateral investment treaty, so long as those claims are
distinct from that of the aggrieved subsidiary. '*

The Claimant refers in passing in the Request for Arbitration to “acts of corruption” against
Lotus’ interests in Turkmenistan;'*? but no particulars of any such acts are given. The
Claimant also refers in the Request for Arbitration to “unlawful seizure of various projects
without full payment and without the consent of Lotus Holding and/or Lotus Enerji, and
the unjust termination of Lotus Enerji from the DCU and SDA Agreement.”!°° Again, no
particulars are given. In its slide presentation at the Hearing, the Claimant referred to “raids
in Lotus’s camps and offices” and seizures of property in February 2017 as an example of
“retaliatory action” by the Respondent.'*! No details are provided. The Tribunal does not
consider that these passing references can be regarded as constituting distinct “claims” in

the Request for Arbitration.

The Claimant maintained in subsequent submissions that it (Lotus Holding) is indeed
bringing its own claims, on the basis that “a shareholder of a company that was aggrieved
in the Respondent's territory was free to bring claims that were related to its own losses.” !*?
The Tribunal does not accept that proposition: a company that is aggrieved in the
respondent’s territory has no general right to bring claims “related to its own losses”: it
may only bring claims related to breaches of its own rights. Moreover, those breaches must

be sufficiently identified in the Request for Arbitration; and in this case they are not.

In paragraph 11 of its Rejoinder, the Claimant stated that:

 

Claimant ... is not seeking damages for breach of contract but for
violation of the ECT and the BIT between Respondent and Turkey.
While the RFA asserts that Respondent’s actions constitute both a
breach of its contracts with Lotus Enerji and violations of the ECT
and BIT, the RFA seeks a remedy only for the treaty violations, not

186.

the contract breaches. In particular, Claimant will seek a remedy for
the following violations of the BIT and the ECT:

a. Depriving Claimant of dividends it would otherwise have
received from Lotus Enerji had Respondent not refused to make
payments due to Lotus Enerji and not unjustly and improperly
terminated contracts with Lotus Enerji;

b. Expropriating Claimant’s investment by improperly and unjustly
forcing Lotus Enerji into bankruptcy;

c. Forcing Claimant to spend millions of dollars — including making
payments to Lotus Enerji’s creditors and employees — to keep Lotus
Enerji afloat; and

d. Depriving Claimant of its right [to] make further investments in
Lotus Enerji or other businesses with dividends for (a) or funds it
had to spend on (c), above.

The Tribunal does not accept that this re-characterization of the claims that had been set
out in the Request for Arbitration changes the fact that the Request itself does not set out
claims that the Claimant’s own rights have been violated. The claims set out in the four
sub-paragraphs (a) — (d) are substantially different from the claims set out in the Request
for Arbitration. They are not explications of the claims made in this case; as is apparent on
their face, they are different claims. None of the points raised there is the subject of a claim

set out in the Request for Arbitration.

The Tribunal considers that in order to put forward a cognizable claim, the Claimant must
at a minimum present allegations that connect the Respondent’s alleged breaches of its
contracts with the Claimant’s subsidiary, Lotus Enerji, to the Respondent’s alleged
breaches of the two treaties, and explain how those treaty breaches caused injury to the
only Claimant in the case, which is Lotus Holding. Without that ‘connective tissue,’ the
Request for Arbitration cannot be regarded as stating a case alleging a breach of the BIT
or the ECT which the Respondent must answer. A State cannot be obliged to defend a case

based solely on conclusory assertions that the State has breached specific treaty provisions.

48

187.

188.

189.

It is undoubtedly correct that shareholders and parent companies may in certain
circumstances bring claims in respect of their own losses that result from the treatment of
a subsidiary. For example, the expropriation of the shares in the subsidiaries themselves,
held by a claimant, would clearly violate the claimant’s rights, entitling it to bring a claim.
But that is not the case here. The Request for Arbitration does not articulate any claims
that do not derive exclusively from — and are not wholly overlapping with — contract claims

belonging to Lotus Enerji.

The Claimant appears to accept, at least in part, that it did not articulate any such claims.

During the Hearing, counsel for the Claimant said:

I would also submit that at least with respect to Lotus Holding’s
claims related to its own losses such as shares, loss of company
value, loss of shares, any amounts it spent to keep Lotus Enerji
afloat, those types of claims that are not related to the agreements
that Lotus Enerji entered into with Turkmen entities, the decision is
clear-cut, and just because some of those ideas were not expressly
articulated in the Request for Arbitration doesn’t mean that the
Tribunal can readily dismiss them pursuant to a 41(5) application.
And this is because that standard must be read and applied in
conjunction with ICSID arbitration Rule 40(2). Rule 40(2)
expressly allows for the inclusion of additional claims until the
submission of a reply. We are not talking about theory of a claim or
the way quantum is calculated in a claim; we are talking about actual
additional claims.'*

Rule 40(2) provides that: “An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later
than in the reply and a counter-claim no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the
Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon
considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a
later stage in the proceeding.” In his treatise on the ICSID Convention, Professor Christoph
Schreuer describes “incidental or additional claims” within the meaning of Rule 40(2) as

follows: “Incidental or additional claims can be of a varied nature. Recurrent instances of

83 Transcript, p. 146, 1. 24 - p. 147, 1. 16.

49

190.

191.

incidental or additional claims are third party contracts, interest on the sums claimed and
procedural costs.” ** Elsewhere, he elaborates that, “[a]n incidental claim arises as a
consequence of the primary claim, such as interest or compensation for procedural costs.
An additional claim is made by way of a later addendum to the original claim.”!°> What is
evident from the foregoing is that the Request for Arbitration must first state an “original”
or “primary” claim in order to trigger Rule 40(2)’s provision for incidental or additional
claims. The Request for Arbitration in this case, however, does not plead any original or
primary claims that could provide a basis for the incidental or additional claim. Thus,
ICSID Rule 40(2) does not assist the Claimant in this context. We now turn to addressing
Claimant’s argument that it may amend the claim stated in its Request for Arbitration on

the basis of ICSID Rule 40 and its reservation of right in the Request for Arbitration.

THE POSSIBILITY OF AMENDING THE CLAIMS MADE IN THE REQUEST
FOR ARBITRATION

It is true that a Request for Arbitration is not a completely rigid delimitation of the claim(s)
before a tribunal. Moreover, paragraph 85 of the Request for Arbitration in this case
contains an express ‘reservation of right to amend’ clause, of a kind common in

arbitrations. It reads as follows:

The Claimant reserves its right to amend or supplement this Request
for Arbitration and the translations submitted herewith, to advance
further arguments and to produce such further evidence as necessary
to complete or supplement the presentation of its claims. Claimant
also reserves its right to make additional claims, and to request such
alternative or additional relief as may be appropriate, including
conservatory, injunctive, or interim relief.

Nonetheless, the Claimant does not have complete freedom to amend its case. The

Claimant in this case specifically “requests the institution of an ICSID arbitration

193.

194.

proceeding against Turkmenistan.”!°° The arbitration is accordingly subject to the ICSID

Arbitration Rules. ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(1) provides that:

...a party may present an incidental or additional claim or counter-
claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute,
provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent
of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.

That is, however, only a basis for making ancillary claims. If an additional claim is not
ancillary to the primary claim(s) set out in the Request for Arbitration, a party has no right
under ICSID Arbitration Rule 40 to present it by way of an ‘amendment’ to the primary
claim. There is no right under ICSID Arbitration Rule 40 to present “additional claims”
that are fundamentally different from the primary dispute, and to abandon the primary

claims.

The Claimant thus has the right to develop its claim to some extent. It is not obliged to
keep its claim strictly within the literal terms of its original Request for Arbitration. But if
the Claimant has purported to modify its claim in a manner that is not permitted by the
principle set out in ICSID Arbitration Rule 40, and has transformed the original claim into
a new claim materially different from that set out in the Request for Arbitration, the
Tribunal cannot make its decision under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) by focusing on the
new claim. If the original claim which the Tribunal was established to determine, as set out
in the Request for Arbitration, was one that should properly have been dismissed because
it was manifestly without legal merit, that defect cannot be cured by transforming it into a
different claim. Even less can it be cured by an assertion that the Claimant might in future

‘modify’ the original claim, again outside the limits of the initial claim.

The Tribunal considers that in the present case the Request for Arbitration sets out a range
of claims arising from contractual obligations owed to Lotus Enerji, and does not give any
clear indication that any claims are made that are, in the Claimant’s words, “not related to

the agreements that Lotus Enerji entered into with Turkmen entities.”!*’ Claims “not

related to the agreements that Lotus Enerji entered into with Turkmen entities” cannot be
brought within the Request by its amendment within the limits prescribed by ICSID

Arbitration Rule 40. They are new claims, beyond the scope of the present proceedings.

CONCLUSION ON THE CLAIMANT’S CLAIMS IN THIS CASE

Having considered all of the submissions made by the Claimant, both in their overall nature
and in detail, paragraph by paragraph, the Tribunal concludes that all of the claims set out
in the Request for Arbitration are properly to be characterized as contract claims relating
to contracts entered into by Lotus Enerji. This conclusion is reinforced by the Claimant’s
references in the Request for Arbitration to the “basis for Lotus Holding to bring contract

”°158 and for the “basis for the assertion of Lotus Holding’s contract claims.”'*? But,

claims
as was noted above, the contract claims are not claims of Lotus Holding: any contract

claims belong to Lotus Enerji, which is not a party to these proceedings.

The lack of standing of Lotus Holding is also fatal to the Claimant’s argument that
‘umbrella clauses’ in some of Turkmenistan’s BITs are to be regarded as incorporated in
the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT by virtue of the MFN clause in Article II(2) of the BIT. Even
if Article II(2) of the BIT has the legal effect for which the Claimant contends (which the
Tribunal does not decide), that could benefit only Lotus Enerji, and not Lotus Holding,

which has no rights under the contracts.

The Tribunal accordingly decides that the claims in the Claimant’s Request for Arbitration
dated 28 July 2017 are, within the meaning of ICSID Rule 41(5), manifestly without legal

merit as claims under the BIT and the ECT and are therefore to be summarily dismissed.

There is another aspect of this case which is relevant, and merits note. The Turkish
Bankruptcy Directorate is in control of Lotus Enerji, which remains in and is subject to the
bankruptcy process. That process involves the collection of Lotus Enerji’s assets and their

disposition in accordance with Turkish law in order to satisfy Lotus Enerji’s liabilities. If

'58 Request for Arbitration, para. 63.

200.

monies are due to Lotus Enerji, whether under the contracts or otherwise (for example,
under the BIT or the ECT), those monies would form part of the assets of Lotus Enerji and
would fall for distribution under the control of the Turkish bankruptcy process. Lotus
Holding is a shareholder in Lotus Enerji; but it has no right to receive any part of those
assets outside of the bankruptcy process. This Tribunal would be mindful of the need to
consider the proper relationship between the Tribunal and the arbitration proceedings on
the one hand, and the Turkish Bankruptcy and the bankruptcy proceedings on the other. In
this case, however, it is unnecessary to consider the matter further because the Tribunal has
decided that the arbitration claims are to be dismissed. For these reasons the Tribunal
considers that the claims made by Lotus Holding against the Republic of Turkmenistan, as
set out in its Request for Arbitration, are manifestly without legal merit and are dismissed
in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) and 41(6). This decision is without
prejudice to any claims, whether or not contractual, which might be brought by or in the
name of Lotus Enerji. Nor does it prejudice any claims, other than those set out in the
Request for Arbitration dated 28 July 2017, which Lotus Holding might institute against

Turkmenistan.

In view of the conclusion in the previous paragraph, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to
address the other objections raised by the Respondent. In accordance with the principle of

judicial economy, the Tribunal does not decide them.

The Tribunal notes for the record that the Parties are agreed that if this Rule 41(5)
application is granted, so that this arbitration ceases, there would ex hypothesi be no

arbitration to which Lotus Enerji could be added as a party.!©°

B. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON COSTS

205. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and
by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of
the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre
shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

206. ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(1) provides:

Without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of
the proceeding, the Tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the
parties, decide:

(a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party shall
pay, pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the
fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the
facilities of the Centre;

(b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs
(as determined by the Secretary-General) shall be borne entirely or
in a particular share by one of the parties.

207. The Tribunal considers that the dismissal of this case is the result of defects in the

Claimant’s Request for Arbitration, and that the Respondent has not contributed to those

deficiencies. Indeed, the Respondent set out its basic submissions regarding the defects in

the Request in its Application dated 4 May 2018, having raised the main points in more

general terms in a letter to ICSID dated 11 October 2017.'™

The Tribunal further considers that the Respondent has not by its conduct in these
proceedings unnecessarily increased the costs, and that its costs, while considerably higher
than those of the Claimant, are not out of line with those typically incurred in investment

arbitrations.

The Tribunal has considered whether, despite the Claimant’s repeated delays in paying the
advances due under ICSID’s Administrative and Financial Regulations, the Respondent
could have made the proceedings shorter and less expensive had it promptly fulfilled its
own duty to pay the advance, rather than adopting the policy that it would make no payment
until the Claimant had paid its own share, and that the Respondent should therefore make
some contribution to the costs of the case. The Tribunal considers, however, that it cannot
be presumed that the Tribunal would have proceeded any sooner if only one Party had
made the payment due, and that in this case no departure from the normal principle that
costs follow the event is warranted. It notes, however, that the consequences of non-

payment of fees as they fall due is a matter that ICSID itself may wish to address.

The Tribunal has also considered whether the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant
did not satisfy the requirements of Article VII of the BIT was properly raised under Rule
41(5). The Tribunal finds that the question of the proper interpretation of Article VII of
the BIT is not one capable of resolution under Rule 41(5).'°° Accordingly, the Tribunal
considers it appropriate to reduce the amount of Respondent’s legal fees payable by the

Claimant by 10 percent.

The costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Prof. Vaughan Lowe QC 31,480.00
Mr. James H. Boykin 38,027.68
Prof. Brigitte Stern 40,282.00
ICSID’s administrative fees 126,000.00
Direct expenses (estimated) 15,990.88
Total 251,780.56

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.'®

The Tribunal decides that in these circumstances the Claimant should pay ninety percent
of the Respondent’s legal fees and disbursements (USD 857,210.70) and all of the costs of
the proceeding, including the Respondent’s share (which amounts to USD 125,890.28) as
set out above. The Claimant shall thus pay the Respondent a total amount of USD
983,100.98. Any question concerning the responsibilities of LexShares, the litigation

funder, is a matter to be resolved between the Claimant and LexShares.

AWARD

For the reasons above, the Tribunal hereby decides:

a. that the claims made by Lotus Holding against the Republic of Turkmenistan, as set
out in its Request for Arbitration, are manifestly without legal merit and are dismissed in

accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) and 41(6);

b. that the Claimant Lotus Holding shall pay the Respondent its share of the costs of the
proceeding and ninety percent of the Respondent’s legal fees and disbursements in the sum

of USD 983,100.98.

166 The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.
