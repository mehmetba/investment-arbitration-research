Petition to Enforce Arbitral Award
Petitioners Hydro Energy 1 S.a.r.l. (“Hydro Energy”) and Hydroxana Sweden AB
(“Hydroxana”) bring this action to enforce an arbitral award (the “Award”) issued on August 5,
2020, in ICSID Case No. ARB/15/42 against Respondent, the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain”),
following arbitration proceedings conducted in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention”).

Pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention and 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, arbitral awards issued

under the ICSID Convention are not subject to collateral attack and must be enforced and given
the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court in the United States.

Accordingly, Petitioners request that this Court (1) enter an order enforcing the Award in
the same manner as a final judgment issued by a court of one of the several states, and (2) enter
judgment in Petitioners’ favor in the amount of €30,875,000, together with interest at the one-year
EURIBOR rate plus 1%, compounded annually, from June 1, 2013 until the date of payment.

A certified copy of the Award is attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Matthew S.
Rozen (“Rozen Decl.”), Exhibit 1 hereto. The Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and
Directions on Quantum (“Jx. Dec.”) is attached as Annex A to the Award and incorporated by
reference therein. See Award §§7, 9. A copy of the ICSID Convention is attached hereto as
Exhibit 2.

Parties

1. Petitioner Hydro Energy is a private limited company (société 4 responsabilité
limitée) incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg.

2. Petitioner Hydroxana is a private limited liability company (Aktiebolag)
incorporated under the laws of Sweden.

3. Respondent, the Kingdom of Spain, is a foreign state within the meaning of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1332, 1391(f), 1602-1611.

Jurisdiction and Venue

4. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the FSIA,
28 U.S.C. § 1330(a), because this is a “nonjury civil action against a foreign state” on a claim
“with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity” under the FSIA. Pursuant to
Section 1605(a)(1) of the FSIA, Spain is not entitled to immunity from this Court’s jurisdiction in

an action to enforce an ICSID Convention award because it has waived that immunity by agreeing

Privileged & Confidential

to the ICSID Convention. See Tatneft v. Ukraine, 771 F. App’x 9, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam);
Blue Ridge Invs., L.L.C. v. Republic of Argentina, 735 F.3d 72, 84 (2d Cir. 2013). Further, pursuant
to Section 1605(a)(6) of the FSIA, Spain is not immune from suit because this is an action to
enforce an arbitral award governed by the ICSID Convention, which is a treaty in force in the
United States for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards. Blue Ridge, 735 F.3d at 85.

5. This Court also has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(b),
which provides that “[t]he district courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction
over actions and proceedings” to enforce awards entered under the ICSID Convention.

6. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Spain pursuant to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C.
§ 1330(b). Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(4).

7. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. does “not apply to
enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the [ICSID] convention.” 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).
Thus, the FAA’s jurisdictional requirements do not apply to this action.

The Underlying Di,

8. Beginning in 1994, Spain adopted legislation with the goal of attracting investment
in renewable energies, among them hydroelectric power, within its territory. Jx. Dec. §§ 73-122.
In reliance on the financial incentives and inducements provided by these legislative measures, in
2011, Petitioners invested €72.3 million in various Spanish companies that own and operate 33
hydropower generation plants in Spain’s territory. Jd. §§ 5,64, 68. After a change in governmental
leadership, Spain adopted a series of laws between 2012 and 2015 retrenching on, and eventually
revoking, the economic incentives on which Petitioners had relied in investing in hydroelectric
power. Id. §§ 133-63. The rescission of these incentives substantially reduced Petitioners’ returns

on its investments. Award §§ 26-27, 123-24.

9. Petitioners’ investments in hydropower generation plants were protected by the
Energy Charter Treaty (“ECT”), which “establishes a legal framework [for] promot[ing] long-term
cooperation in the energy field” and seeks to “create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions for investors, including a commitment to accord fair and equitable treatment.” Jx. Dec.
49 541, 543-44; see generally ECT (Exhibit 3 hereto).

10. The ECT protects investments in the territory of a “Contracting Party” to the treaty
by “Investors” located or incorporated in “other Contracting Parties.” ECT, arts. 1(7), 10(1), 26.

11. Spain is a Contracting Party to the ECT,' so the ECT protects investments in Spain
by investors located or incorporated in other Contracting Parties. Award 4 1; Jx. Dec. §§ 446,
502(7).

12. Petitioners Hydro Energy 1 and Hydroxana Sweden AB are investors under the
ECT, and are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and Sweden, respectively. Luxembourg
and Sweden are both parties to the ECT.? Both entities’ investments in Spain are therefore
protected by the ECT. Jx. Dec. § 502(7).

13. Contracting Parties to the ECT consent to submit disputes arising under that treaty
to arbitration. Article 26(3)(a) of the ECT provides that “each Contracting Party hereby gives its
unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration . . . in accordance
with the provisions of this Article.” Article 26(4)(a)(i) further provides that where “the
Contracting Party of the Investor and the Contracting Party . . . to the dispute are both parties to

the ICSID Convention,” the dispute will be submitted for arbitration under that convention.

Accordingly, Spain consented to arbitrate the underlying dispute pursuant to the ICSID
Convention.

14. On October 5, 2015, Petitioners filed a request with the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) for arbitration under the ICSID Convention. Jx.
Dec. 7. Petitioners contended that Spain’s legislative and regulatory actions that resulted in
reducing the returns on Petitioners’ investments constituted a breach of Spain’s obligations under
the ECT. Id. 4 5-6.

15. An ICSID arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal’”) was constituted on May 3, 2016. Jx.
Dec. ¥ 11.

16. The Tribunal conducted a hearing on jurisdiction, merits, and quantum in Paris,
France from April 2, 2018, to April 5, 2018. Jx. Dec. § 36.

17. On March 9, 2020, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and
Directions on Quantum, a 236-page decision that is incorporated by reference in the Award, in
which it decided, among other things, that:

i. The Tribunal had jurisdiction over the dispute, Jx. Dec. 4 770(1);

ii. Spain had an obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT to respect Petitioners’
“legitimate expectation” that they would earn “a reasonable return on their
investments, and that any modifications would be reasonable and equitable,” Jx.
Dec. FJ 308-09, 695; and

iii. Petitioners’ right to compensation under the ECT therefore depended on “whether
the remuneration of [their] facilities” following Spain’s challenged measures
“accord[ed] with a reasonable rate of return,” Jx. Dec. §§ 697, 717; see also id.

§770(3).

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 6 of 9

Draft
Privileged & Confidential

18. The Decision also resolved certain threshold disputes about how rate of return
should be calculated. But rather than immediately deciding whether Petitioners’ remuneration fell
short of a reasonable rate of return—and therefore whether and to what extent Petitioners were
entitled to compensation under the ECT—the Tribunal instructed the parties to “attempt to reach
agreement” on the key inputs to this question: the reasonable rate of return to which Petitioners
were entitled, and the actual rate of return for Petitioners’ facilities. Jx. Dec. 4] 761-67, 770(3)-
(5).

19. On August 5, 2020, following joint submissions by the parties, Award § 13, the
Tribunal issued the Award. The Tribunal made findings about the rate of return and determined
that Spain had breached Article 10(1) of the ECT by depriving Petitioners of a reasonable rate of
return on their investments in hydroelectric power. Jd. {§ 26-27. The Tribunal thus ordered Spain
to pay €30,875,000 as compensation, in addition to interest at the one-year EURIBOR rate plus
1%, compounded annually, from June 1, 2013 until the date of payment. Jd. { 162(1).

Legal Basis for Relief

20. The ICSID Convention provides that contracting parties must “recognize an award
rendered pursuant to [the] Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed
by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.” ICSID
Convention, art. 54(1). The ICSID Convention further provides that a contracting state “with a
federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal courts and may provide
that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent

state.” Id.

21. The United States is a contracting party to the ICSID Convention and is therefore
obligated to enforce the Award as if it were a final judgment of a court in the United States.> That
obligation is fulfilled by 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, which provides:

(a) An award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter IV of the

convention shall create a right arising under a treaty of the United States. The

pecuniary obligations imposed by such an award shall be enforced and shall be

given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court

of general jurisdiction of one of the several States. The Federal Arbitration Act (9

U.S.C. 1 et seq.) shall not apply to enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the

convention.

22.  Arbitral awards issued against a foreign state pursuant to the ICSID Convention
may be enforced by bringing a plenary action in federal court in compliance with the requirements
for commencing a civil action under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and with the personal
jurisdiction, service, and venue requirements of the FSIA. See Micula v. Gov’t of Romania, 104
F. Supp. 3d 42, 49-50 (D.D.C. 2015); Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela, 863 F.3d 96, 100, 117-20 (2d Cir. 2017).

23. Awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention are not subject to collateral attack
in enforcement proceedings under 22 U.S.C. § 1650a. “Member states’ courts are . . . not permitted
to examine an ICSID award’s merits, its compliance with international law, or the ICSID tribunal’s
jurisdiction to render the award; under the Convention’s terms, they may do no more than examine
the judgment’s authenticity and enforce the obligations imposed by the award.” Mobil Cerro, 863
F.3d at 102.

24. The ICSID Convention therefore “reflects an expectation that the courts of a
member nation will treat the award as final.” Mobil Cerro, 863 F.3d at 102; see also ICSID
Convention, arts. 53(1), 54(1). Consistent with this mandate, 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a) provides that

the FAA “shall not apply to enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the convention,” thereby
“mak[ing] [the FAA’s defenses] unavailable to ICSID award-debtors in federal court enforcement
proceedings.” Mobil Cerro, 863 F.3d at 120-21. District courts thus enforce ICSID awards
without allowing substantive challenges to enforcement of the awards. See, e.g., Tidewater Inv.
SRL v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 2018 WL 6605633, at *6 (D.D.C. Dec. 17, 2018); Duke
Energy Int’l Peru Invs. No. 1 Ltd. v. Republic of Peru, 904 F. Supp. 2d 131, 132-34 (D.D.C. 2012);
Order, Republic of Panama v. Jurado, No. 8:12-cv-1647, Doc. 18 (M.D. Fla. June 13, 2013).
C f Acti LR for Relief

25.  Arbitral awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention are subject to mandatory
enforcement in the courts of the United States, which must give those awards the same full faith
and credit as a final judgment issued by a state court. 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).

26. The Award was rendered in accordance with the ICSID Convention against Spain
and in Petitioners’ favor. Petitioners are therefore entitled to enforce the Award’s pecuniary
obligations against Spain.

27. Accordingly, Petitioners are entitled to an order (a) enforcing the Award in the same
manner as a final judgment issued by a court of one of the several states, and (b) entering judgment
in Petitioners’ favor in the amount specified in the Award.

28. Petitioners request that the Court enter judgment in euros, which is the currency
specified in the Award. See Award §f 123-24, 162(1). This Court has authority to enter judgment
in a foreign currency when requested by the judgment creditor. See Cont’l Transfert Technique
Ltd. v. Federal Gov't of Nigeria, 932 F. Supp. 2d 153, 158 (D.D.C. 2013), aff'd, 603 F. App’x 1,

4 (D.C. Cir. 2015); accord Leidos, Inc. v. Hellenic Republic, 881 F.3d 213, 220 (D.C. Cir. 2018).
