INTRODUCTION
The Parties

The Claimant, Enkev Beheer B.Y., is a private limited tiability company with its corporate seat
in the Netherlands. The Claimant is represented in this arbitration by Mr. R. Schellaars and Mr.
M, Raas, Simmons & Simmons LLP, Claude Debussylaan 247, 1082 MC Amsterdam, the
Netherlands.

The Respondent is the Republic of Poland, represented by Dr. D.A.M.H.W. Strik, Linklaters
LLP, Zuidplein 180, 1077 XV Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and Dr. C.W. Wisniewski,
Linklaters LLP, Warsaw Towers, Sienna 39, 00-121 Warsaw, Poland.

The Parties’ Dispute

In brief, the dispute arises out of the Claimant's alleged investment as an investor in its Polish
subsidiary, Enkev Polska S.A., a joint stock company with its corporate seat in Lodz, Poland
(“Enkev Polska”). Enkev Polska owns certain industrial facilities in the centre of Lédz (the
“Lodé Premises”) and holds a perpetual usufruct right to the property under Polish law for the
use of the fand as real property for 99 years.’

The Claimant contends that, in 2012, 2013 and currently in 2014 to date, the Respondent made
and continues to make a series of threats to expropriate the Claimant’s investment, and that this
act of expropriation is underway, in such a way as to violate the Respondent’s international
responsibilities.’ The Claimant attributes to the Respondent the conduct of its Ministry of
Economy, that of the local city government in Lodz (the “City of Lodz”), and that of the Polish
Information and Foreign Investment Agency (“PalilZ”).

The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction; it disputes the admissibility of the

Claimant’s claims; and it denies any wrongdoing to the Claimant.

THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY
The Commencement of the Arbitration

On 6 August 2012, the Claimant served a Request for Arbitration on the Respondent pursuant
to Article 8 of the Treaty between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Poland
on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, signed on 7 September 1992,
entering into force on | February 1994 (the “Treaty"), and Article 3 of the Arbitration Rules of
the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as revised in 2010 (the
“UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules”).

On 6 November 2012, the Claimant appointed Professor Albert Jan van den Berg as a Co-
Arbitrator and the Respondent appointed Dr. Klaus M. Sachs as a Co-Arbitrator. The two Co-
Arbitrators appointed Mr. V.V. Veeder as Presiding Arbitrator on 30 November 2012.

On 29 November 2012, the Claimant submitted an “Addendum” to its Request for Arbitration
with updated alleged factual information regarding events taking place after the filing of the
Request for Arbitration. The Respondent informed the Claimant that: “it does not accept that
this exposé will be part of the Request for Arbitration."*

On 15 January 2013, the Respondent submitted a Response to the Claimant’s Request far
Arbitration asking that the Tribunal dismiss the Claimant's claims for lack of jurisdiction. In
the alternative, the Respandent requested that the Tribunal bifurcate the proceedings in a merits

phase and a quantum of damages phase.

On 13 February 2013, the Tribunal and the Parties’ legal representatives signed the Agreed

Terms of Appointment.

The Claimant’s Request for Interim Measures

On 21 January 2013, the Claimant submitted a Request for Interim Measures in which it sought
to (i) preserve the status quo and “thus avert undue expropriation of its Léd% Premises and
damages that if will suffer as a result thereof,” (i) oblige the Respondent to provide the
Claimant with “information on the exact (time) planning, drawings and remedial works to be
undertaken [...] for the proposed works in Lodz” under Article 26(2)(a)-(0) and 26(3) of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; and (iii) “[appoint] an expert to conduct a survey and make an

Parties’ joint letter to the Tribunal, dated 23 November 2012, 4] 8; Respondent's Response to the Request for
Arbitration, daled 14 January 2013 (“Respondent's Response to the Request for Arbitration"), a! 3, note 1.

assessment of the Lodz Premises to preserve evidence regarding the state and characteristics of
the Lédz Premises and operating mechanics and conditions” under Articles 26(2)(d) and 29 of
the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.*

On 23 January 2013, a first procedural hearing was held by telephone. During this hearing, the
Respondent suggested that it submit its written response to the Request for Interim Measures by
4 February 2013. The Tribunal informed the Parties that before that date either Party could
apply to the Tribunal if there were material developments requiring the Tribunal’s urgent
attention. The Parties also agreed that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) act as
Registry.

On 25 January 2013, the Respondent noted the following written statement made by the Vice-
President of the City of Lédz (Mr. Stepien) on the same date:

On behalf of the City of Ladé | hereby declare that until 04.02.2013 no administrative
decision will be issued, which could constitute a legal basis for expropriation af ENKEV
Polska S.A. from the right of perpetual usufmuet the Company has over the real estate
located in Lodz at Targowa Street 2. 5
In the same communication, the Respondent further elaborated on the timing and procedures
applicahle to an expected expropriation of the L6dz Premises under Polish law. The

4 in support of

Respondent emphasised the expropriation’s “clearly non-impending character,
the Respondent's request to extend until 4 February 2013 the deadline for its Response fo the

Request for Interim Measures.

By letter dated 31 January 2013, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal take emergency
action in response to the statement by the Vice-President of the City of Lédé. The Claimant
Tequested that the Tribunal: (i) order the Respondent to take all measures necessary to prevent
the Polish authorities from issuing any expropristory measures until the Tribunal’s decision on
interim measures; or fii) arder the Respondent to make best efforts to prevent the competent
Polish authorities from issuing any expropriatory measures until the Tribuna]’s decision on
interim measures, or (ili) take any ather appropriate measures to prevent immediate and grave

harm to the Claimant until the Tribunai’s decision on interim measures.

Measures”), 8.3, see also 917.3.

E-mait message from the Respondent dated 25 January 2033,

On 4 February 2013, the Respondent submitted its Response to the Claimant's Request for
Interim Measures, seeking the dismissal of the Request. In the event that the Tribunal ordered
interim measures, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the Claimant to provide
appropriate security under Article 26(6) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

On 13 February 2013, a Hearing on the Claimant's Request for Interim Measures (“Hearing on

Interim Measures”) was held in Berlin, Germany.

On 8 March 2013, the Tribunal issued an Order on Interim Measures and Other Procedural
Matters stating, in operative part:
93. Interim Measures: Having considered the Parties’ several oral and written
submissions made to date, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimant's Request for
Interim Measures under Article 26(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. It is not
therefore necessary for the Tribunal to decide the Respondent's request for security

under Article 26(6) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules given the Tribunal's
decision to dismiss the Claimant's Request.

94, Tribunal Expert: The Tribunal decides, in principle, to appoint an expert to the
Tribunal under Article 29 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, with terms of
reference reflecting the scope of work agrced by the Parties. The Tribunal will
select and appoint such an expert in further consultation with the Parties, as soon as
possible.

On 8 March 2013, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal clarify and/or supplement the Order
on Interim Measures. On 11 March 2013, the Tribunal observed that it did not consider that any
addition or interpretation was required since it had dismissed the Claimant's Request for

Interim Measures in its entirety.

On 22 May 2013, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that a meeting behveen the President
of Enkev Polska { a, the jeader of the Polish social-democratic party (Sojusz
Lewicy Demokratyczne/) and trade unions had been held at the Lédz Premises. The Respondent
contended that this meeting was widely reported by the Polish media, contrary to the Tribunal’s
direction at the Hearing on Interim Measures not to aggravate the dispute through undue

publicity.

The Claimant’s Document Production Request

On 18 March 2013, pursuant to Article 27(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the
Claimant sought an order for production of four categories of documents available to the
Respondent regarding (i) the public purpose for the expropriation of the L6dz Premises and (ii}
the due process that the Respondent was obliged to afford to the Claimant under Articles 5(a)

and 4(b) of ihe Treaty (the “Document Production Request”),

22,

25.

26.

On 25 March 2013, the Respondent conmunented on the Claimant's Document Production
Request, asking the Tribunal to reject the Request or. in the alternative, to amend the current

limetable by two to three months,

On 2 April 2013, the Claimant replied to the Respondent's objections to its Document
Production Request, arguing that the Request is “tied directly to the Respondent's assertions in

these proceedings.”

On 22 April 2013, the Presiding Arbitrator, on behalf of the Tribunal, issued Procedural Order

No. 3 on Document Production which provided:

5. The Tribunal declines, for the time being, to make orders for the production of
documentation by the Respondent comprised within the Claimant's Request for
Document Production. Nonetheless, the Tribunal hereby keeps that Request on the file
and anticipates that the Request could be decided by the Tribunal promptly, if and to
the extent necessary, one way or the other following the Respondent’s submission of its
Caunter-Memorial (with associated dacumentation and other evidence} due no later
than 15 May 2013, but before the Claimant’s next responsive pleading, namely its
Reply Memorial due no later than 24 May 2013

a

To that end, given the short time between these two written pleadings, the Tribunal
considers il necessary to establish at this stage, in advance, a further procedure for
deciding any disputed document production requested by the Claimant as at 1S May
2013; namely:

. if and to the extent that the Respondent should wish a1 the time of its Counter-
Memorial to decline voluntarily to produce any documentation comprised within
the Claimant’s Request for Document Production, the Respondent shall state the
reasons for its objection to produce such documentation in the form of a
Redfern/Park Schedule to be submitted to the Claimant, along with the Counter-
Memorial; and

i, the Claimant shall thereafter have a brief opportunity to respond to the
Respondent’s reasons {as soon as practicable but not more than five days) in the
form of additional entries to that Redfern/Park Schedule to be then submitted by the
Parties to the Tribunal for its decision.

On 19 May 2013, the Claimant submitted « Redfern/Park Schedule completed by the Parties

with regard to the Claimant's Document Production Request.

On 31 May 2013, the Presiding Arbitrator, on behalf of the Tribunal, issued Procedural Order
No. 5 on Document Production dismissing the Claimant’s Request for Document Production,
dated 18 March 2013.

The Parties’ Written Pleadings

On 2 April 2013, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim in which it agreed with the
Respondent’s proposal in its Response ta the Request for Arbitration to bifurcate the

proceedings.

On 19 April 2013, the Presiding Arbitrator, on behalf of the Tribunal, issued Procedural Order
No. 2 on Bifurcation in which the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the jurisdiction and liability

phase from the damages phase of the proceedings.

On 7 May 2015, the Claimant submitted a Request for Clarification arguing that a map in one
of the Respondent’s exhibits (Exhibit R-7} showing the 2002 Study of Conditions and
Directions of Development for Lédz incorrectly depicted the current location of the Lédé
Premises as well as the planned trajectory of the Nowotargowa Street. The Claimant requested

the Respondent’s explanation on the exhibit and its origin.
On 1S May 2013, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial.

On 17 May 2013, the Claimant notified the Tribunal that it intended to file an additional
witness statement on Polish administrative law and proceedings under the Road Legislation by
24 May 2013, The Claimant argued that this additional submission was required ta respond to
certain allegations and “various novel tines of argument” contained in the Respondent’s

Counter-Memorial which were material to the Claimant's case.

On 20 May 2013, the Respondent replied to the Claimant’s Request for Clarification of 7 May
2013. The Respondent criticised the Request as belatedly issued and, hence, outside the
procedural timeframes foreseen by the Tribunal. According to the Respondent, Procedural
Order No. 2 required the Statement of Claim to have been a “full written statement of the
Claimant's case.” Accordingly. the Claimant was required to raise the matter in its Statement of
Claim, Regarding the substance of the Claimant’s Request, the Respondent asserted thai the
map contained in Exhibit R-7 served only demonstrative purposes regarding the plans that
exisied over time for the construction of the Nowotargowa Street. To support this contention,
the Respondent submitted e-mail correspondence dated 9 February 2013 sent by the City of
Lédz, which contained maps of the City’s historical development plans from 1949-2010, each
depicting the planned road in relation to the Lédz Premises.

On 21 May 2013, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal dismiss the Claimant's request to
submit an additional witness statement for four reasons, namely that (i) ail opinions should
have been attached to Claimant's Statement of Claim; (ii) the Respondent's argument was not
novel and would not merit new submissions; (ifi) it would jeopardise the faimess of the
proceedings; and (fv) it would not contribute to increasing procedural efficiency while causing,

unnecessary additional costs.

On 23 May 2013, the Claimant filed its additional witness statement with annexes.

37.

38.

On 24 May 2013, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Reply. [t applied conditionally to add
Enkev Polska as co-claimant pursuant to Article 22 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and
§ 1046(2) of the German Code of Civil Procedure (“GCCP"). The Claimant further renewed its
Request for Interim Measures, based on Articles 22 and/or 26 of the UNCITRAL Arbiation
Rules and § 1041 GCCP, ding that it faced dited expropriation p dings in
Poland which would likely materialise in June 2013 (the “Renewed Request for Interim
Measures”). Reiterating its “urgent interest in some form of stability,” the Claimant requested
thal the Tribunal grant it provisional relief to preserve the stufus quo at the Lodz Premises
pending either the issuance of a partial final award on jurisdiction and liability, or subsidiarily,
pending the issuance of a partial final award with declaratory relief on the interpretation and

application of Article 5(c) of the Treaty.

On 7 June 2013, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder.

The Expert Site Visit to Enakev Polska's Premises

On 27 March 2013, at the Tribunal’s request, the PCA provided the Parties with a list of four
independent cxperi candidates, recommended by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, to
serve as an expert pursuant to paragraph 94 of the Order on Interim Measures and Article 29 of
the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

On 29 April 2013, the Presiding Arbitrator, on behalf of the Tribunal, issued Procedural Order
No. 4 on the Appointment of an Expert. Having taken into consideration the comments made
by both Parties, the Tribunal nominated i Expert in accordance with
Article 29 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

On 8 May 2013, the Expert, the Parties and the PCA held a conference cail during which the
Parties agreed with thc Expert that the inspection of the Lédé Premises would be conducted on
29 May 2013 by the Expert and his assistant. The Parties further agreed on the expected agenda
of the site visit, the documents to be provided to the Expert and the time frame for the Expert's
report. The Parties were unable to agree, however, on the scope of the Expert’s mandate or on

the nced for the Expert to be present at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability.

On 21 May 2013, the Chairman, on behalf of the Tribunal, noted that:

[t]he expert's function is essentially to make a permanent record of what he and the Parties
consider relevant to the Parties’ dispute; and, during the site inspection, he should be free
to interpret his mandate in the most useful and efficacious manner possible, exercising his
own professional discretion. This should not be an occasion for debating or even
attempting to resolye that dispute — hence disputes regarding the merits should have no
place during this site inspection, as to which the Parties’ respective positions before the
Tribunal are fully reserved.

On 29 May 2013, the Expert's signed Terms of Reference were circulated to the Parties.
On the same day, the Expert conducted the site visit at the Lodz Premises.

On 14 June 2013, the Expert submitted his draft Expert Report inviting the Parties to provide

comments thereon.

On 26 June 2013, the Claimant submitted its comments to the draft Expert Report inviting the

Expert to provide additional information on certain items referred to tn the Expert Report.

On 15 July 2013, the Expert submitted his revised Expert Report. The Tribunal added the

Expert Report to the evidential file in this arbitration.

50.

accompanied by a corresponding transcript of a statement made by the current Mayor of Lodz
(Ms. Zdanowska) on 7 May 2012 on the alleged goals pursued by the previous administration
of Lédz in regard to the road construction. Exhibit C-142 was a letier from the representative of
Enkev Polska ( } to the then First Vice-President of Lodz (Mr. Tomaszewski) of
29 May 2009. The Tribunal allowed the admission of these exhibits into the evidential file

subject to an application by the Respondent to submit rebuttal evidence,

Also during the hearing, the Parlies agreed to hold a video-conference on 25 June 2013 to
examine one of the Respondent’s witnesses (Mr. Cieslak), who was not available for

examination during the hearing on 13-14 June 2013.

On 18 June 2013, the Respondent applied “to have Ms. Hanna Zdanowska put forward as a
witness in relation to Exhibit C-141 submitted by Claimant,” confirming her availability for
cross-cxamination during the video-conference scheduled for 25 June 2013. On the same day,
the Claimant communicated to the Tribunal that it would “be able to accommodate the

examination of another witness on Tuesday 25 June 2013.”

On 24 June 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural! Order No. 6 on the Additional Rebuttal
Factual Witness called by the Respondent, instructing the Respondent to submit to the Claimant

and the Tribunal in advance a short signed written witness statement by Ms. Zdanowska.

On 25 June 2013. a video-conference was held during which Mr. Cieglak and Ms. Zdanawska

were examined and cross-cxamined by the Parties.

On 5 July 2013, the Parties filed their Post-Hearing Briefs.

The Parties’ Post-Hearing Exhibits

On 28 June 2013, the Respondent submitted as Exhibits R-80 to R-83 copies of slide
presentations jt used at the hearing on {3-14 June 2013 and two maps of a local Spatia) Plan
that dated back to 1993 (the 1993 Spatial Plan”). The Claimant likewise submitted ils hearing
presentation as Exhibit C-147 on } July 2013, along with excerpts of a valuation report dated
14 January 2013 as Exhibit C-148.

On 2 July 2013, the Respondent objected to the admission of Exhibit C-148, stating that it
lacked any procedural foundation and was made after the deadline set by the Tribunal. The
Respondent commented that “for the sake [of] equal parties’ rights” it wished to submil ovo
exhibits—a motion dated 9 March 2012 brought by Enkev Polska in the proceedings for the
adoption ef a new local zoning plan for the City of Lod2 and excerpts of a 2010 Study (Exhibits

5

55.

56.

57.

58.

59.

R-84 and R-85),’ should the Tribunal admit Exhibit C-148. On the same day, the Claimant
agreed to the admission of Exhibits R-84 and R-85.

On 3 July 2013, the Claimant submitted a document thal it described as the legend pertaining to
the map of the 1993 Spatial Plan (with English translation), requesting the Tribunal to admit the
document as Exhibit C-149.

On 5§ July 2013, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal not admit Exhibit C-149 for three
reasons, First, the document did not contain a legend but rather a textual excerpt from the 1993
Resolution on the Adoption of the Local Zoning Plan which was, according to the Respondent,
not “an integral and necessary part of the 1993 [Spatial Planj.” Second, the request made by the
Tribunal during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability was limited to the production of
certain maps only. Third, the Respondent argued that the 1993 Spatial Plan, including its
textual and graphic parts, were publicly available and should have been produced by the
Claimant at an earlier stage of the proceedings since the Respondent filed the 1993 Spatial Plan

as Exhibit R-7 prior to the Hearing on Interim Measures on 13 February 2013.

On the same day, the Claimant commented on the Respondent’s objection to admit Exhibit
C-149 into the evidential record. It argued that the Respondent's objection was
“incomprehensible from a substantive and formal point of view" because the alleged
inadequacy of the maps contained in Exhibit R-7 was the primary reason why the Tribunal
requested the Respondent to submit another copy of the 1993 Spatial Plan. The Respondent
should have produced the document prior to the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability.
Moreover, the map of the 1993 Spatial Plan would be incomplete without a legend to it. The
Claimant argued that, contrary to the Respondent’s contention, it had not submitted other texts
than the chart and definitions pertaining to the 1993 Spatial Plan.

Post-Hearing Developments 2013-2014

July 2013: On 19 July 2013, the Respondent informed the Tribunal and the Claimant that the
City of E.6dz had filed its application for funding from the EU Infrastructure and Envirnnment

Operational Programme on 28 June 2013.

August 20/3: By e-mail dated 2 August 2013, the Claimant raised concerns about the late date
of receipt of the City’s EU application, as well as the absence of any English translation and the

exclusion of the annexed documents—in particular, a schedule for the City’s modemisation

project—-that it claimed were material to the Claimant’s case. According to the application
described by the Claimant," the City of Lod set 31 December 2013 as the final deadline for the
acquisition of the Lédz Premises and set aside PLN 50,000,000 for this purpose—which was
insufficient (in the Claimant’s submission) to cover the expected costs, approximately
PLN 65,000,000, for the relocation of its facilities.

By an e-mail reply dated 9 August 2013, the Respondent argued that the submission of the
application was intended for information only. In response to the Claimant’s concerns about the
timing, language, and 1 of the ission, the R: stated that it

the application as soon as it was received by Counsel; that the omitted enclosures comprised
hundreds of documents, the production of which would be neither useful ner justified; and, that
the Tribunal should not accept the Claimant’s informal, unofficial translated excerpt. Further,
the Respondent noted that an exact date for the physical acquisition of the Lédé Premises in
particular would be determined by the expropriation decision yet to be issued. According to the
Respondent's reading of the application, the City of Lodz set aside PLN 50,000,000 for the

acquisition of all outstanding plots of land, not just for the premises of Enkev Polska.

By c-mail dated 27 August 2013, the Claimant alleged that the City of Lédz had dismissed the
Mayor's application for an expropriation decision on 26 July 2013 pursuant to a request to

withdraw the application by the Mayor on the previous day.

September 2013. By response c~mai! dated 6 September 2013, the Respondent contended that
the information submitted by the Ciaimant on 27 August 2013 had “no material, if any at all,
impact on the subject matter of the pending arbitral proceedings.” It explained, through an
enclosed map, that the change in the construction plans prompting the withdrawal of the

application would have no bearing on the plans for the L6dz Premises.

On 7 September 2013, the Claimant requested information on the origin of the demonstrative

map attached to the Respondent’s 6 September e-mail.

On 10 2013, the R d itted the map hi and indicated that it

had enquired as to the origin and (he intended use of the map with the City of Lédz. The
Respondent also enclosed a copy of a letter dated 5 September 2013 in which a representative
of the City, Mr. Nita, elaborated on the Claimant’s questions concerning the recent change in

the City’s construction plans for the city centre and the road junction system.

The Claimant provided an excerpted English translation, which it submitted as Exhibit C-15¢.

On 11 September 2013, the Claimant replied to the Respondent's e-mail stating that it would
“take mitigation steps” and hold the Respondent “fully to account for further costs for
mitigation of damages and altemative locations.” The Claimant argued that the Respondent's
failure to report on the Mayor's withdrawal of the application constituted a breach of the Order
on Interim Measures, in which the Tribunal asked the Parties to report pertinent changes in
circumstances, and in particular, “any decision made in response to the City of Léd2’s

application of 28 January 2013.”

On 12 September 2013, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to decide on the admissibility of any
further correspondence between the Parties and to advise on the further course of the arbitral

proceedings.

Following a further exchange of communications, the Tribunal asked that the Parties refrain

from further cor unless the cor da specific ication to the

Tribunal, notwithstanding that all prior orders of the Tribunal remained in force.

January 2014: By email messages and letters dated 20, 23 and 28 January 2014 (with
attachments), the Claimant applied for: (#) permission to submit into the evidential record
provisional exhibits C-150, C-15], C-152 and C-153; (ij) amended further interim measures;
and (iii) permission to make further submissions in relation to such exhibits and measures,
orally and/or in writing. The Respondent opposed the Claimant's application by letter dated
24 January 2014. The Tribunal ordered a procedural meeting to be held by telephone

conference call on 7 February 2034.

February 2014: This procedural meeting took place on 7 February 20/4, attended by the
Parties and their legal representatives. It was recorded by transcript (copies of which were later
distributed to the Parties by the Tribunat’s Procedural Order No. 8).

By Procedural Order No. 7 of 10 February 2014, referring to the Parties’ recent correspondence
and oral submissions during the procedural meeting, applying the Tribunal’s Procedural Order
of 25 June 2013 and Article 31 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal decided. as a

procedural order: (a) te admit into evidence the Claimant’s new four provisional exhibits, to be

18

marked Exhibits C-150, C-151, C-152, and C-153; (b) to order the Claimant to provide a
written submission explaining, its case based upon these four Exhibits, as soon as possible but
no later than 17 February 2014 (such submission to be “self-contained”; i.e., to replace the
materials made by the Claimant in writing, as listed above); (c) to permit the Respondent to
respond to such written submission by the Claimant, as soon as possible following receipt
thereof, but no later than 28 February 2014 (such submission fo be likewise “self-contained”);
(d) to dismiss the Claimant's application for amended interim measures; and (e) to reserve its
decision on the Claimant's application for further oral submissions (whether at an oral hearing
in-person or by telephone conference caJ}) until the Tribunal had reviewed the additional

written submissions from the Parties.

The Claimant, by its written submission dated 17 February 2014, explained its case based upon
the four new Exhibits marked C-150, C-151, C-152, and C-153; and the Respondent, by its
written submission dated 28 February 2014 (with nine new exhibits marked Exhibits R-87 to
R-95), explained its oppasition to the Claimant’s submission, including any argument that there

existed any justifying the pening of these p

to Article 31(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

Pursuant

March 2014: By Procedural Order No. 9 of 23 March 2014, having reviewed these written
submissions from the Parties and applying the Tribunal’s order of 25 June 2013 and Article 31
of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal decided to admit into the evidentiary record
the Respandent’s nine new exhibits (albeit that none is material to decisions made in this

Award) and not to grant the Claimant's application for further oral submissions.

By letter to the Parties dated 22 April 2014, the Tribunal confirmed that it formally closed these
arbitration proceedings as regards issues decided in this Award pursuant to Article 31(1) of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, further to Paragraph 4 of Procedural Order No. 9 dated
23 March 2014.

e

The following factual summary is drawn by the Tribunal largely from the Parties’ pleadings, as
considered relevant to the Tribunal’s decisions fater in this Award. Many of these facts are
common ground between the Parties; but many inferences from such facts, as well as certain

important facis alleged by one Party, remain much in dispute between the Parties.

Materially Undisputed Facts

Enkev Polska has operated in Lédé since the 1960s.” In 2001, the Claimant acquired
approximately 79 percent of shares in Enkev Polska, making it the controlling shareholder of
the Polish company. The L.6d% Premises were of particular interest for the Claimant both for
their advantageous employment conditions and for their strategic location in Eastern Europe—a
growing market for its businesses."” Upon its acquisition of shares, the Claimant undertook to
modemise and optimise the technical state of Enkev Polska’s production lines and its operation

on the Lodz Premises.

At the Lodz Premises, Enkey Polska produces semi-finished products on the basis of natural
fibres and latex for use in fumiture, packing. mattresses, horticultural and technical
applications.'' It supplics approximately 250 customers within and without Poland; and it
produces some 691 differen articles.'* According to the Claimant, any interruption of
operations at the LGdZ Premises could Jead to a substantial (or even complete) disruption of the

Enkev Poiska’s business in Poland."

The Lodz Premises are situaled in the centre of Ldd#, adjacent to a railroad station thet
connects Lédz and Warsaw, at a location that the Claimant considers to be strategically

advantageous for any public or private investor. '*

When the Claimant commenced its operations with Enkey Polska in Lédé, the Lodz Premises

were included in a local Spatial Plan dating back to 1993. The purpose of the 1993 Spatial Plan

was to illustrate the City's zoning plans and projected public construction works at that time.
The 1993 Spatial Plan showed the trajectory of a road known as Targowa Street along the left
side of the L.6dz Premises; it projected that the road’s corridor might be widened (or shortened)

to a certain degree; but it did not set forth its complete redirection.*

In anticipation of the expiration of the 1993 Spatial Plan on 31 January 2003, a new planning
phase began in 2002 within the City. During this planning phase, the Council of the
Municipality adopted a Study of Conditions and Directions of Development (the “2002
Study”). The 2002 Study set out the Municipality’s policies regarding spatial planning. The
2002 Study was binding on the local authorities; but it was not an enforceable local act

comparable to a general spatial plan.'*

After the 1993 Spatial Plan expired on 31 January 2003, the City of Lad2 did not adopt and has
not adopted a new spatial plan. As a consequence, the Ladz Premises have not been subject to a
genera) spatial plan since 2003. The national Spatial Planning and Development Act of
27 March 2003 provides that in situations where a certain plot of land is not covered by a
spatial plan, the property development is governed by the municipatity’s “decisions on building

conditions” (“WZ-decision”)."7

On 10 Aprit 2003, the national Act on the Detailed Principles of Preparing and Implementing
Public Road Projects (the “Road Legislation”) entered into foree. The Road Legislation makes
easier expropriations for the construction of public roads than other expropriations for a

different purpose. '*
Article 17 of the Road Legislation provides (in English translation):

Article 17.

1. Where a legitimate public or economic interest exists, a provincial governor, in the case
of national and provincial roads, or a district head, in the case of district and focal roads,
shall, at the request of the relevant road administration authority, declare a decision
consenting to the implementation of a road project immediately enforceable.

3. The decision referred to in subsection t:
1} (repealed);

2) obligates parties to immediately hand over real properties and immediately vacate
premises and other areas;

3} entitles the relevant road administration authority to take actual possession of real
properties:
4) authorises the commencement of construction works [...].!°

Under Article 17 of the Road Legislation, the competent focal authority (e.g., the City of Lodz)
may request that the relevant road administration authority render an expropriation decision
(“ZRID decision”) and declare the decision to have immediate enforceability. If granted, with
such a declaration, the aggrieved party must then hand over its property immediately after the

issuance of the ZRID decision.

In addition, Article 31(2) of the Road Legislation provides that, once the construction works
mentioned in Article 17(3}(4) of the Road Legislation have begun, the aggrieved party has no
remedy in the Polish administrative courts. It can file a complaint in the Polish administrative
courts arguing that the ZRID decision is unlawful; but this complaint has no suspensive effect

on the execution of the ZRID decision.

Article 31(2) of the Road Legislation reads (in English translation):

Article 31.1. [...]

2. Hf a complaint against a decision consenting to the implementation of a road project that
was declared immediately enforceable is admitted, then after the expiry of 14 days from
the date on which the construction of the road started an administrative court may only
state that the decision violates the law for reasons specified in Article 145 or Article 154 of
the Code of Administrative Procedure.

3.f-.)"
Thus, the Polish administrative courts can rule ex post facto that the expropriation decision was
unlawful; but they have no power to reinstate the sfafus quo ante 1o the benefit of the aggrieved
party. An aggrieved party is only entitled to claim damages from the State for unlawfui

treatment.”

Foltowing the controversy surrounding the constitutionality of the Road Legislation, the Polish
Constitutional Court ruled on 16 October 2012 that the Road Legislation’s provisions are
consistent with the Polish Constitution. The Constitutional Court acknowledged the absence of
any judicial remedy that could halt ongoing construction works following an act of
expropriation, The Coun considered this absence to be justified “in the interest of all society
members” and in the light of the fact that “equitable” compensation had to be paid by the State
to the deprived panty.”

In 2005, the Claimant acquired further shares in Enkev Polska,”

On & January 2007, the Mayor of the City of L6dz issued a W2Z-decision which permitted

Enkev Polska to expand its warehouse capacity on the Lédé Premises.

In 2007, the City Council of Lddz issued a Resolution on the development of a new city centre

as part of a broader plan to become, as it wished, the “Cultural Capital of Europe” (the “2007

 

tution”). The isation plans isaged, inter alia, the ion of a new main
railway station, the rebuilding of the City’s road network and the surrounding infrastructure, as

well as the construction of a large new cultural centre, the Camerimage Centre.”*

To co-finance the modernisation project, the City of Lédz announced that it would prepare an
application for a significant infrastructure subsidy from the European Union. The grant would
provide EUR 63,000,000—59 percent of the total costs—for the modernisation project.*
According to the Respondent, applicants are required to show that they own the plots affected

by the modemisation plans to be admitted into the EU’s selection pracess.””

In mid-2007, officials from the City of L6dz approached Enkev Polska to express the City’s
interest in acquiring its premises. The parties entered into negotiations about a potential

relocation of the L.ddz Premises toe accommodate the construction of the Camerimage Centre.

The City of Lodz first offered to acquire the Lodz Premises on 24 December 2008 for
PLN 17,781.000 {approximately EUR 4,400,000). This offer was rejected by Enkev Polska and

the Claimant.*

In 2009, the Claimant acquired an additional tranche of shares in Enkev Polska, thereafter
holding approximately 98 percent of the total shares in Enkev Polska.”

Between April and Octaber 2010, the Respondent proposed an alternative site for the relocation
of the L6dz Premises which Enkev Polska and the Claimant rejected.*

While negotiations were still ongoing in the course of 2010, the City of Lédé issued a Study of
Conditions and Directions of Development (the “2010 Study”) which was binding on local
authorities. The 2010 Study was informed by an Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure
conducted by the Regional Director for Environmental Protection. On 1} June 2010, the
Regional Director announced publicly that any potentially affected individual could review the

procedural files and raise objections against the planned development.”

Neither the Claimant nor Enkey Polska took part in the Environmental Impact Assessment
Procedure.” [t seems an inexplicable omission. Nonetheless, the Tribunal accepts that it was an
innocent mistake. as explained further below, with no consequences for the decisions made

below in this Award.

On 27 September 2010, the Regional Director for Environmental Protection issued a “decision
on environmental conditions” {the “2010 Decision on Environmental Conditions”). This
Decision ordered, inter alia, that the trajectory of Targowa Street would lead through the
middle of Enkev Polska’s L6édé Premises.” After the construction works were completed,
Targowa Street would be re-named Nawotargowa Street. The 2010 Decision on Environmental
Conditions finalised the trajectory of the propased Nowotargowa Street with no possibility of

amendment under Polish law.

On 15 November 2010, after the Claimant learmed of the 2010 Decision on Environmental
Conditions, Enkev Polska expressed to the City of Lédz its disappointment that the latter had
initiated the Environmental impact Assessment Procedure without specifically notifying Enkev
Polska. Enkev Polska also asserted that the Cicy af Lédz had pramised to inform Enkev Polska
in advance of any administrative proceedings which could affect the production facilities at the
Lodi Premises.” The Respondent contended in this arbitration that Enkev Polska had sufficient
means to become aware, in a timely manner, of the Environmental Impact Assessment
Procedure and thal it was at fault in failing to become so aware. It seems there was an

inadvertent and unfortunate mistake on both sides.

100. On 22 November 2010, the Head of the Bureau of Investments of the City of Lédé responded to

Enkev Polska. stating that:

‘The announcement on the issue of the Decisian No. 2212010 of 27 September 2010 of the
Regional Environmental Protection Director in LodZ was posted on the notice board in the
Bureau of Investments of the City of Lédz Office from 04 October to 18 October 2010.
The decision came in force on 04 November of that year.

1am truly sorry that we did not inform you about the above actions and I promise to notify
you of any plans to be introduced in future, however I would like to emphasise that the
legal procedure of making @ decision public was duly observed by the Regional
Environmental Protection Director. *

101. In November 2011, Enkey Polska filed an application with the City to convert its perpetual

usufruct right regarding the L4dz Premises to full ownership under Polish law.

102. On 11 January 2012, a mecting took place between the director of Enkey Polska

¢ 1, the co-owners and directors of the Claimant ( i

and representatives of the City of Lodz. The City discussed its plan to construct
Nowotargowa Street through the Lodz Premises, making clear that the plan was final and that
the trajectory of the new road could not be changed.”” The City informed Enkev Polska and the

Claimant that Enkev Polska was fegally obliged to vacate the middle section of its Lodz

Premises to enable the construction of a new road system as part of the envisaged

modemisation of the City centre."

Subsequently, the parties’ representatives held several meetings to discuss a potential relocation

of Enkev Polska’s production facilities.

In May 2012, the City of Ladz offered to acquire the Lddz Premises for a purchase price of
PLN 26,000,000 (approximately EUR 6,500,000). The Claimant and Enkev Polska rejected this

revised offer.”

On % July 2012, the Claimant, a representative of PalilZ and the Economic Counselor of the
Netherlands Embassy in Poland attended a meeting to discuss relocation options. The Claimant
rejected the proposals, saying that the proposed alternative sites were physically unsuitable for

Enkev Polska.“®

On 20 July 2012, a representative of the City of Lodz (Mr. Nita) reiterated to

{for the Claimant} that the plans for the construction of the new read would
neither be changed nor postponed. Mr. Nita advised the Claimant that the final deadtine for
acceptance by Enkey Polska would be the end of August 2012." He clarified that, if the parties
failed to enter into a joint purchase agreement, the City of Lodz would acquire the title to the

by means of expropriation.”

 

L6d4 Premises on the basis of the Road Legislation,

No progress was made at a further meeting held in Warsaw on 27 August 2012, attended by
representatives of the Claimant, the Undersecretary of State of the Polish Ministry of Economic

Affairs and the Dutch Vice-Prime Minister.

At an additional meeting in Warsaw on 13 September 2012, the Vice-Mayor of the Cily of
L6dé (Mr. Cieslak) informed the Claimant that the City would not expropriate Enkev Polska’s
premises at ihe end of August 2012. He repeated the City’s offer to acquire the Lodz Premises

for PLN 26,000,000 (approximately EUR 6,500,000). In the absence of any agreement on

value, the parties agreed to a re-valuation of the Lodz Premises by a joint valuator.*

The valuation report dated 14 January 2013 concluded that the value of the part of the Lédz
Premises to be affected by the road project totalled PLN 5,816,000 (approximately
EUR 1,450,000), white the value of the remaining parts amounted to PLN 18,690,000
(approximately EUR 4,500,000), making the overail value of the Léd% Premises
PLN 24,506,000 (approximately EUR 5,950,000).** The parties did not agree on this report's
findings.“

On 28 January 2013, the Mayor of Lédg filed an ex parte request with the City’s Department of
Town Planning and Architecture to expropriate Enkev Polska's premises (the “2013
Expropriation Request’).” The Department found the 2013 Expropriation Request to be

or y and it sent the application back to the Mayor’s Office.

The City of Lddz informed Enkev Polska on 6 May 2013 that, as soon as the Department of
Town Planning and Architecture confirmed the completeness and accuracy of the 2013
Expropriation Request, Enkevy Polska would receive a formal notification of the

commencement of the expropriation proceedings with a copy of this Request and its exhibits.

On 25 July 2013, the Mayor of Ladz withdrew the 2013 Expropriation Request, noting an

intention to re-submit the application with modifications by the end of September 2013,”

On 30 September 2013, the City of Lédz adopted a motion for an immediately enforceable
expropriation decision for part of Enkev Polska’s Lédz Premises under the Road Legisistion
[(C-151]. This motion was not formally notified to Enkey Polska or the Claimant, although both
soon learnt of its existence. Without formal notification, it had no immediate effect under

Polish law.

On 30 December 2013, the City of Lodé adopted a motion to commence the decision-making
procedure for an immediately enforceable expropriation decision for part of Enkev Polska’s
Lod% premises. This motion was notified to Enkev Polska on 7 January 2014 (the
“Notification”) [C-150]. With such notice, there were under Polish law certain legal and

practical effects, as submitted by the Claimant. These are addressed later in this Award.

By letters dated 13 and 17 January 2014 to the City of Lédz, Enkev Polska responded ta the
Notification [Exhibit C-152], By letter dated 22 January 2014, the City of Lédé replied to Enkev
Polska [Exhibit R-87). This correspondence was followed by a letter dated 1] February 2014 to
the City of Lédz from Enkev Polska’s Counsel with a list of six questions (R-88] and a letter
datcd 18 February 2014 from the Roads and Transport Authority in Lédz 10 the Consortium
Torpol-Astaldi-Interdecor-PBDiM requesting information to be provided in response to Enkev
Polska’s questions (R-B9].

Dispuied Facts and inferences

116. The Parties dispute several facts and factual inferences. For the sake of completeness, certain of

these are summarised below, although none is materially relevant to the decisions made by the

Tribunal! later in this Award.

137. The Parties disagree about the precise content of the 2002 Study and, in particular, the

se

trajectory of the Nowotargowa Street as there projected. The Claimant contends that the 2002
Study reaffirmed the trajectory as set out in the 1993 Spatial Plan, i.e., that the Nowotargowa
Street cut off only an edge of the Iefl part of the L6dz Premises." Aceording to the Claimant,
the 2002 Study projected that only insignificant changes to the trajectory of the Targowa Street
were expected to the extent that, in the worst case, its widening would have cut off an office
building at the left part of the Lodz Premises. The Claimant did not consider this possibility a
major concern because neither the main warehouse nor the production facitities would be
affected.*! As late as 2009, Enkev Polska's President ( ) understood that the
Targowa Street would be rebuilt, meaning enlarging the existing Targowa Street rather than
building the new Nowotargowa Street.” Consequently, the Claimant takes the position that the

changes made in the 2010 Study were not predictable at the time of its investment because the

Nowotargowa Street was not simply an extension of the Targowa Street, but rather a new street

alongside the latter.*?

(18. The Respondent, while agreeing that the exact trajectory of the Nowotargowa Street has

changed, maintains that the street was always “planned to run through” Enkev Polska’s Lodz
premises.” The planning documents of the 1990s, and even those of the 1970s, reveal that the
trajectory alway’s cut through the same areas which it cuts today. Only slight eastward or
westward changes were discussed. Today’s planning situation is accordingly “very similar” to
that contained in the 1993 Spatial Plan.** Hence, the Respondent contends that the 1993 Spatial
Plan (as confirmed by the 2002 Study) illustrated the predictable possibility that title to at feast
part of Enkev Polska’s premises would have to be transferred at a later stage to the City of
Lédz, The Respondent concludes that the risk of being expropriated was known by Enkey
Polska for almost twenty years and that it necessarily formed part of the Ciaimant's risk
assessment before taking its decision to invest in Enkey Polska in 2001 and, more so,

subsequently.

119, The Parties further disagree on the content and outcome of sevcral meetings conducted between

Enkev Polska and representatives of the Respondent. In connection with the meeting of
{3 September 2012, the Claimant describes that the Parties agreed to a re-vaiuation of the L6dz
Premises based on (i) the sales value, (ff) the relocation value and fiii) the standard of
Article 5{c) of the Treaty.” The Respondent, on the other hand, contends that it insisted that the

valuation method be determined by an independent valuator.*

120. Finally, the Claimant maintains that a letter of 17 October 2012 from the City of Lédz

3

s

announced the City’s plan to expropriate Enkev Poiska’s premises with immediate effect,”
while the Respondent regards the letter as only a reminder to proceed with the re-valuation of

the Lédé Premises.” The letter reads in relevant part:

IV. THE FINAL RELIEF REQUESTED BY THE PARTIES

121. The Claimant requests the Tribunal to award the following relief “in ihe form of an order,
interim award, partial final award or final award, as the Tribunal deems fit":

(A) Declaratory relief consisting of a finding that Respondent has failed to comply with
its obligations under the BIT, in particular Articles 3 and/or 5 thereof;

(B) Declaratory relief consisting of finding on the interpretation and application of Article
5(c) of the BIT, by reference to the statements and exhibits adduced by the parties in
these arbitral proceedings:

(C) An award providing for damages for the consequences of the Respondent's failure to
comply with its obligations under Articies 3 and/or 5 of the BIT;

(D) An award providing for restitutio in integrum end/or an award pursuant to which
Enkev is restated, to the maximum extent possible, in the situation existing prior to an
expropriation by the Respondent:

(E

An award for costs of the arbitral proceedings and legal representation, to the extent
permissible under the agreed upon rules of arbitration and the BIT; and,

(F) Granting such further or amended relief as the Tribunal may deem fit.
122. The Respondent requests the Tribunal, in the form of final relief, to:

render an award declaring that jt has no jurisdiction to hear the Claimant's claim and/or
that the Claimant's claim is otherwise inadmissible; or altematively to dismiss the
Claimant's claim in its entirety. In both cases, the Respondent requests the Tribunal -
particularly taking into account that the Claimant's claim is centred on an expropriation
which has nol yet even taken place - to award it costs associated with the arbitral
proceedings and legal representation insofar as permissible under the Treaty.

More explicitly in relation to the question of the Claimant's claim for costs, this must of
course he denied given that - either on the basis of 2 lack of jurisdiction/admissibility or on
the basis that the Claimant’s claims must be dismissed in their entirety - the Claimant has
brought such costs upon itself. Even if the Tribunal were to award the Claimant part of its
requested relief, it is the case that Article 12(9) of the Treaty mandates that cach party shall
bear the cost of the arbitrator it appoints and its representation, and the costs of the
Chairmen as well as any other costs must be bome in equal parts by the Parties,63

V. JURISDICTION

Introduction

The Respondent advances three objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction based on Articles 8 and
| of the Treaty. (For ease of reference, the Tribunal subsumes within these jurisdictional
objections other like objections to the admissibility of the Claimant’s claims). The Claimant

rejects all these objections.

In describing the Parties’ respective cases on Jurisdiction (as also later below on the Merits),
the Tribunal only summarises those cascs for the purpose of recording its decisions in this
Award. It should not be assumed that any submission or reference by either Party has been

overlooked by the Tribunal by reason of its omission from these summaries.

Article 8 of the Treaty provides, in relevant part:

(1) Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting
Party relating to the effects of a measure taken by the former Contracting Party with
respect to the essential aspects pertaining to the conduct of business, such as the measures
mentioned in Article 5 of this Agreement [i.c, the Treaty] or transfer of funds mentioned in
Article 4 of this Treaty, shall to the extent possible, be settled amicably between both
parties concemed.

(2) If such dispute cannot be settled within six months from the date either parry request
amicable settlement, it shall upon request of the investor be submitted to an arbitral
tribunal. In this case the provisions of paragraphs 3-9 of Article 12 shall be applied mutatis
mutandis, Nevertheless the President of the Arbitration Institute of the Arbitral Tribunal of
the Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm shall be invited to make the necessary
appointments. [...]

Article | of the Treaty defines certain terms as follows:
For the purposes of this Agreement:

a) the term “investments” shall comprise every kind of asset and mare particularly, thaugh
not exclusively:

i. movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem in respect of
every kind of asset:

ii. rights derived from shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in companies and joint
ventures;

iii. title to money and other assets and to any performance having an economic value;

iv. rights in the field of intellectual property, technical processes, goodwill and know-
how;

v. rights to conduct econamic activity, including rights to prospect, explore, extract
and win natural resources, granted under contract, administrative decisivns or under
the legislation of the Contracting Party in the territory of which such activity is
undertaken.

32

127,

128.

129.

130.

b) the term “investors” shall comprise with regard to either Contracting Party:

i. natural persons having the nationality of that Contracting Party in accordance with
its law;

ii. without prejudice to the provisions of (iii) hereafter, legal persons constituted under
the law of that Contracting Party;

ii. legal persons, wherever located, controlled, directly or indirectly, by investors of

that Contrasting Party. [...]

 

The Respond intains first that the threshold requit of Article 8(2) are not met by
the Claimant; second, it submits that the Claimant’s claims fall outside the scope of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article 8(1) of the Treaty; and third, it contends that the Claimant
did not adduce any or any sufficient evidence to establish that Enkev Polska enjoys the status of

an “investor” under Article 1(b) of the Treaty.

Moreover, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's only “investment” within the meaning
of Article Ia) of the Treaty was its shareholding in Enkev Polska and the rights derived from

such shareholding—nothing more.

Article 8(2) of the Treaty

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent concurs with the Claimant that Article 8(2) of the Treaty reflects a standing
offer on the part of a Contracting Party to the Treaty (j.e., here the Respondent) to arbitrate in
accordance with its terms.“ By such terms, the Respondent considers this offer conditional
upon the fulfillment of two binding pre-requisites, namely (7) the Claimant’s notification to the
Respondent of a dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent and (ii) the Claimant’s
obligation to seek amicable dispute resolution prior to its initiation of arbitration proceedings,

such as this arbitration.

According to the Respondent, the Claimant failed to meet both threshold requirements. More
specifically, the Respondent subrnits that the Claimant has never provided a notice of its claims,
let alone “a coherent articulation of how any actions of the City of Lédz might affect [...]
Enkev Beheer’s shareholding [in Enkev Polska].* Any correspondence exchanged in early

2012 referred to by the Claimant related exclusively to investments made by Enkev Polska. In

the Respondent's submission, there is no evidence on the record that the Claimant notified the

Respondent of the existence of a dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent,

131. The Respondent submits further thal, even if the Tribunal found an implied notice of claim, the

Claimant failed to abide by the six-manth waiting period provided in Article 8(2). Since the
Request for Arbitration was filed on 6 August 2012, a notice of claim should have been
received from the Claimant no Jater than 6 February 2012 and attempts by the Claimant to
negotiate and settle its claims amicably should have taken place from this date. According to
the Respondent, there was no such notice and there were no such negotiations.*” While the
Respondent admits that negotiations between the Claimant, the City of £4dz and PalilZ took
place as of the date of delivery of the Request for Arbitration, it submits that these negotiations
do not meet the timing requirement of Article 8(2) of the Treaty. In the Respondent’s view,
Article 8(2) provides that any potential parties to the dispute shall conduct negotiations,
meaning the investor and the representatives of the Republic of Poland (at 4 governmental

level}. as opposed to representatives of the City of Lodz and Palilz.*

132. The Respondent acknowledges that the Claimant participated in several meetings with

representatives of the Republic of Poland between 20 August and 11 September 2012.
However. since these meetings were conducted after the Request for Arbitration had been
submitted by the Claimant, according to the Respondent, they cannot qualify us attempts at

amicable dispute settlement as required by Article 8(2).”

133. The Claimant is not entitled, according to the Respondent, to commence these arbitration

proceedings in any accelerated manner—neither by invoking the Treaty’s Most Favoured
Nation Clause nor by filing an application for interim measures—since the obligations of
Article 8(2) form “the cornerstone of consent in the [Treaty]” and cannot therefore be

circumvented by the Claimant.”

The Claimant's Position

134. The Claimant submits that it has attempted to resolve the dispute amicably with the

Respondent. It points to several meetings and exchanges of correspondence with the City since

early 2012 to show that the Claimant has made all reasonable efforts to reach a settlement.”! In
light of the Respondent’s alleged unwillingness to settle the dispute by way of negotiations, the
Claimant contends that complying with the six-month waiting period stipulated in Article 8(2}
of the Treaty is not required.” Moreover, according to the Claimant, the Respondent's lack of
responsiveness bars the Respondent from arguing that the Claimant did not abide by the waiting

period 3

In the event the Tribunal finds the six-month waiting period to be required by the Treaty, the
Claimant seeks to incorporate the more favourable three-month waiting periods found in Article
8{(1) of the UK-Poland BIT, Article 8(2) of the Finland-Poland BIT and Article 26 of the
Energy Charter Treaty, by virtue of the Most Favoured Nation Clause cantained in Article 3 of
the Treaty.

Article 3 states:

2. More particularly, each Contracting Party shat} accord to such investments ful! security
and protection which in any case shall not be less than that accorded either to investments
of its own investors of to investments of investors of any third State, whichever is more
favourable to the investor concemed.

Article 8(1) of the Treaty

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent's principal arguinent against the Claimant's claims is that these claims are al}
premature since no expropriation has taken place to date; in particular. no “measure has been

taken under Article 5 of the Treaty depriving the Claimant or Enkev Polska), directly or

indirectly, of any asset, property or rights.” It also submits that the Claimant is obliged to
exhaust loca! remedies in Poland before initiating arbitration proceedings under the Treaty. It
contends that the “local remedies rule” is a fundamental principle of international law. Since
the Treaty is silent on this issue, the Parties should assume that the Claimant must exhaust all
loca) remedies available under Polish law. (Intemational taw requires an investor “to make
reasonable efforts to allow the (judicial) State apparatus to catch any mistake of an
administrative body."”* Exceptions from the local remedies rule could only be made in very
limited, extraordinary situations entailing a claim for denial of justice.” This type of
exceptional circumstance is, however, not present in this case because Enkev Polska has access
to recourse in Polish courts once a decision on expropriation and compensation is made.”
Moreover, given that no expropriation decision even now has been taken, the Claimant cannot

be regarded as having its local dies, In the Respondent’s ission, “it would

be at odds with the local remedies rute for this Tribunal to make any decision relating to the

direct expropriation of the Lodz Premises.”””

138. The Respondent further asserts that the Claimant's claims fall outside the scope of Articte 8(1)

of the Treaty."” According to the Respondent, Article 8(() limits the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
to disputes (i) “relai[ing] to the effects of a measure with respect to ‘the essential aspects
pertaining to the conduct of business’”; and (ii) “regard[ing] expropriation or the transfer of
funds.""! The Respondent disputes that any of its measures have had an impact or might have

an impact on essential aspects pertaining 1o the conduct of business."

139. The “essential conduct of business” concerns, in the Respondent’s submission, the proper

functioning and the continuation of Enkev Polska’s business, the engagement of Enkev
Polska’s employees and Enkev Polska's ability to serve customers and to meet its shareholders"

expectations. The alleged violations of Articles 3(1), 3(2), 3(S) and 5 of the Treaty thus relate to

the conduct of Enkev Polska’s business and not to the business of the Claimant.” The
Respondent maintains that no actions, still less any measures, have been taken that could affect
either the Claimant’s shareholding or its rights to contro! Enkev Polska as a shareholder.
Consequently, so the Respondent contends, there is no basis for the Claimant's claim under
Article 8(1) of the Treaty.“

The Claimant's Position

140. The Claimant submits that its claim is not premature for four reasons. First, the Respondent has

made explicit and repeated threats of expropriation which, at a minimum, give rise to claims
under Article 3 of the Treaty (Fair and Equitable Treatment; and Fuli Protection and
Security). Second, in regard to Article 5 of the Treaty, the expropriation procedure has been
formally commenced; and that procedure is currently ongoing.” Third, the Claimant asserts
that there is no public interest in the expropriation of Enkev Poiska’s premises; that due process
has already not been accorded to the Claimant; and that the expropriatory measures are contrary
to certain “undertakings” given by the Respondent.” Fourth, according to the Claimant, the
Respondent has stated that it will not offer any compensation above that which it has already
offered, in an inadequate amount, and that such compensation does not meet the standard for

compensation required under Article 5(c) of the Treaty.®*

To demonstrate that the scope of Article 8(1) of the Treaty also entails claims regarding Article
3 of the Treaty (and not only claims regarding Article 5 as argued by the Respondent), the
Claimant refers to the object and purpose of the Treaty and also Articte 2 of the Treaty.

142. Article 2 provides:

Either Contracting Party shall, within the framework of its laws and regulations, promote
economic cooperation through the protection in its territory of investments of investors of
the Contracting Party. Subject to its eight to exercise powers conferred by its laws or
regulations, each Contracting Party shall admit such investments.

143. As regards the object and purpose, the Claimant characterises the promotion of investments as a

“central theme” of the Treaty reflecting the Contracting Parties’ intention to “let investments in

the Contracting States grow and flourish.’ Accordingly, the denial to an investor of Fair and
Equitable Treatment or Full Protection and Security would be contrary to the Treaty’s express
object and purpose. The Claimant submits further that the Respondent's actions also affect
essential aspects relating to its conduct of business since “[t]he proper functioning and
continuation of Enkev’s business is at issue as wcll as the future employment and engagement
of its employees, ability to service its customers and meet the expectations of its other
stakeholders.”

144. The Claimant also rejects the Respondent's argument that it was required to exhaust local

remedies in Poland. According to the Claimant, since the Treaty does not contain such a rule,
the Claimant is not obliged to exhaust local remedies prior to the initiation of these arbitration
proceedings.” The Claimant also maintains that the local remedies rule is neither a general rule

nor a fundamental principle of international law.”

Whether the Claimant Is an “Investor” Within the Meaning of Article 1(b) of the Treaty

145. The Parties agree that the Claimant qualifies as an “investor” within the meaning of

Article 1(b)(i) of the Treaty.”* They dispute almost everything else under Article 1, particularly
in regard to Enkev Polska.

The Claimant's Position

146. If the Tribunal were to decide not to accept the Claimant’s claim on behalf of Enkev Polska, the

8

Claimant applies to amend its claim in accordance with Article 22 of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules and § 1046(2) GCCP to add Enkev Polska as a co-claimant to this
arbiteation.™ It is the Claimant's position that the Respondent raised a new line of argument
with its Counter-Memorial—that the Claimant has no standing with regard to the alleged Treaty
breaches directed at Enkev Polska.** The Claimant contends that the Respondent would not be
prejudiced in its procedural or substantive position by adding Enkev Polska as co-claimant.

because the Respondent “hes made a full Statement of Defence [i.e. the Respondent's Counter-
Memorial] in response to the case raised by the Claimant.” Moreover, the Claimant asserts
that the Respondent has admitted Enkev Polska’s status as investor under Article 1(bXiii) of the
Treaty.”

The Respondent's Position

147, The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s application to add Enkev Polska as a co-claimant,
submitting that to do so would seriously prejudice the Respondent, particularly at such a late
stage of these arbitration proceedings. The Respondent notes that the Claimant made its
application less than one week before the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, despite having
filed its Request for Arbitration nine months earlier. If the Tribunal were now 1o allow the
addition of Enkev Polska as a co-claimant at this stage, the Respondent would not be afforded
the opportunity io defend itself. That would be a violation of Article 17(1) of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules which requires that each Party must have a reasonable opportunity to present
its case and be treated equally and fairly.” The Respondent submits that Enkev Polska is “an
entirely separate claimant with an entirely separate claim”; and there are no newly discovered
facts or circumstances which could now justify a decision to afford Enkev Polska standing in
these proceedings.’ The Respondent submits further that the Claimant failed to provide any

legal basis on which the Tribunal could allow the requested “conditional joinder.""!

E, Whether the Claimant Made an “Investment” Within the Meaning of Article 1{a) of the
Treaty

148. The Parties disagree on which of the Claimant’s assets qualify as an “investment” within the
meaning of Article 1(a} of the Treaty, namely (i) the Claimant’s share purchase transactions to
acquire shares in Enkev Polska; (ii) the allocation of the profits generated by Enkev Polska; (iii)
the goodwill and know-how created by Enkev Polska; and (iv) the time and management efforts

undertaken by the Claimant."

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent agrees with the Claimant thet the shares held by the Claimant in Enkev Polska
constitute an “invesiment” within the meaning of Article 1(a)(i} of the Treaty but nonetheless
criticises the Claimant for not submitting a complete record of documentary evidence as to the
number and timing of its share acquisitions in Enkev Polska.”

The Respondent maintains that the reinvestment of Enkev Polska's profits does not constitute
an “investment” by the Claimant under Article |(a)(i) of the Treaty. Accordingly, the
Claimant's decision not to distribute profits generated by Enkev Polska to its shareholders
would, in the R dent’s submission, not i a further i in Poland by the

 

Claimant separate from the investment constituted by the acquisition in the shares of Enkev

Polska."

‘The Respondent submits that the Claimant's investment is therefore limited to its shareholdings
in Enkev Polska and the rights derived from such shares under Polish law. Under Polish law.
the Polish Commercial Companies Code (“PCCC™) does not provide shareholders of a Polish
joint stock company with rights related to the assets of that company.’ Articles 11 and 12 of
the PCCC state that a joint stock company is a juridica] person distinct from ifs shareholders
and that the property of the shareholders are to be distinguished from the property of the joint

stock company.'*

Under Polish law, Enkev Polska’s entitlement to the Lodz Premises and its
buildings used in perpetual usufruct belonged exclusively to Enkev Polska and could not form
part of the Claimant's assets.’ The same conclusion applies to machinery, refurbishments, and

fixtures since these assets pertained to or increased the value of the Ladd Premises.'*

The Respondent submits that a perpetual usufruct right entitles its holder under Polish law to
use the land owned by the Polish State Treasury or local governments for a limited time,
subject to certain restrictions, and upon payment of a monetary consideration.'” The

usufructary (the user), while owning the buildings and other facilities on the land, may use the

Jand only in a manner specified in the agreement with the land-owner. This ownership of all
structures is, however, closely connected to the perpetual usufruct right, meaning that, upon the
expiry or termination of the perpetual usufruct right of the land, also the ownership of the
buildings expires.'"® According to the Respondent, the osufructary is entitled to receive
payment for the buildings equal to their value as of the date of expiry of the perpetual usufruct
right. The valuation method for such payment is, according to the Respondent, based on the
market value or, if the market value cannot be estimated due to the nature of the property, the

nt

replacenient value, The Respondent concludes that, in practical terms, the payment in the

case of expiry of a perpetual usufruct right is assessed on the same basis as compensation for

the expropriation of the perpetual usufruct right.'"?

153. The Respondent further contends that the goodwill and business prospect of the company, as

well as the know-how vested in the Polish employees was “exclusively, or largely” created by

Enkev Polska; and that, hence, that is not an investment of the Claimant.""*

154. According to the Respondent, the distinction between the Claimant’s assets and Enkev Polska's

assets is of pivotal importance for the case. While the Claimant was in fact an investor, it has
standing only to remedy any alleged Treaty breaches relating to its own investments in Poland,
limited to its sharehnidings in Enkev Polska and the rights derived therefrom. Moreover,
according to the Respondent, the Tribunal should not “circumvent creditors[‘] rights” by
“awarding damages to Enkev Polska’s shareholders in relation to breaches of the Treaty duties
owed by [the] Respondent vis-a-vis Enkey Polska.”"'"*

155. Unlike other international agreements, so the Respondent submits, the Treaty does not contain a

provision that empowers the controlling shareholder of a company to submit a claim on behalf
of that company, in addition to a claim for itself.!"® Accordingly, under this Treaty, the
Claimant can only file claims in this arbitration with respect to its own investment. Therefore.
the Respondent urges the Tribunal to dismiss al} claims that do not concern the Claimant’s own

investment in the form of Enkev Polska’s shares.""*

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant submits that it made four investments: (i) the Claimant's share purchase
transactions to acquire shares in Enkev Polska, (ii) the allocation of the profits generated by
Enkev Polska; (iii) the goodwill and know-how created by Enkev Polska; and (iv) the time and
management efforts undertaken by the Claimant,''”

The Claimant’s first investment was made by purchasing shares in Enkev Polska in 2001, 2005
and 2009. The acquisition of such shares served, in the Claimant’s submission, as a vehicle
through which it materialised further investments in Poland.'"* Its ownership of 98 percent of
Enkev Polska's shares gives it control of Enkev Polska. In the Claimant’s submission, the
ownership of these shares confers upon the Claimant the perpetual usufruct right held by Enkev
Polska for the Lodz Premises. '”

Accordingly, the Claimant claims to be the holder of a perpetual usufruct right with respect to
the land comprising the Lodz Premises since 5 December 1990, for a period of 99 years with
the possibility that the term be further extended. In November 2011, according to the Claimant,
it submitted an application to the City of Lddz to convert the perpetual usufruct right into full
ownership, although the Claimant also asserts that there is “not much of a difference between
full ownership and perpetual usufruct rights” when it comes to valuation because both rights are
accessory rights under Polish law. 2° According to the Claimant, it is also to be considered as
the full owner of the buildings situated on the Premises.’2! The Claimant further submits that
the Road Legislation puts the holder of a perpetual usufruct right on an equal footing to a full
owner, meaning that the expropriation legislation applies to perpetual usufruct holders as it

would to full owners.!*

According to the Claimant, its second investment was realised hy reinvesting the profits

generated by Enkev Polska between 2001 and 2013 in Enkev Polska, rather than distributing

them among its shareholders. These profits totalled PLN 16,392,416 and were devoted to

“equipment and non-maintenance improvement.”

The Claimant submits further that its business relations with clients like IKEA and Johnson

Controls constitute a third investment.“

Based on the goodwill and business prospects
established with its clients, the Claimant was able to train its Polish employees and, thus,

transfer know-how to Enkev Polska.’

The Claimant next contends that the Respondent's strict differentiation between the Claimant's
own assets and Enkev Polska’s asscts does not reflect international investment law. It is the
Claimant’s case that shareholders are entitled to bring claims regarding measures that affect the
company and its assets, not just shares and shareholder rights as such,'"° The participation of a
foreign investor in a locally incorporated company is an investment itself. Hence, the Claimant
concludes that it can bring a claim involving measures depriving Enkev Polska’s investment of

its Treaty protections.”

THE CLAIMS UNDER THE TREATY

The Claimant contends that the Respondent violated the Deprivation Standard in Article 5 of
the Treaty, the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard (“FET Standard”) in Article 3(1), the
Full Security and Protection Standard in Article 3(2), as well as other international obligations

towards foreign investors imported by the Umbrella Clause in Article 3(5) of the Treaty.!"*

In contrast, the Respondent submits that it has taken no action that would amount to a breach of

any of these Treaty provisions.”

Article 5 of the Treaty

164. Article 5 of the Treaty provides:

Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly,
investors of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless the following
conditions are complied with:

a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;

b) the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which the former
Contracting Party may have given;

c) the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of just compensation.
Such compensation shall represent the real value of the investments affected and
Shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable,
without undue delay, fo the country designated by the claimants concerned in any
freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.

1 Deprivation of the Investment under Article 5 of the Treaty

The Claimant's Position

165. Asa preliminary matter, the Claimant reiterates that it is not categorically opposed to vacating

(28

139

no

wt

the Lodz Premises; but that it needs time and the financial means to do so as well as to find an
alternative suilable Jocation.'* However, the Claimant emphasises that it is not possible to
move from the Premises in the traditional sense as a result of its tailor-made buildings for the

set-up of its machinery on the Premises.'*!

166, The Claimant contends that “[tjo some extent [a] deprivation [within the meaning of Article 5

of the Treaty} has already taken place and to another it is about to take place.”"** The Claimant
interprets the term “deprivation” as derived from Article 4 as including not only “an outright
taking of property but also any such unreasonable interference with the usc, enjoyment or
disposal of property as to justify an inference that the owner thereof will not be able to use,
enjoy or dispose of the property within a reasonable period of time after the inception of such

interference."

167. The expected future expropriation is, according to the Claimant, impending rather than

hypothetical." 1¢ will not only oceur in the “classical form” of taking assets such as land and

5 such other

buildings but also in the form of a deprivation “of the benefits of other asscts,
assets being the buildings’ fixtures, machinery assembly, intertwined production lines,
customised installations as well as a trained workforce, business opportunities and the time and
energy the Claimant's technical expert ( and the Claimant’s commercial
director ( } spend on Enkev Polska’s operation. "6 The fact that the Respondent only
plans to expropriate Enkev Polska would not render the Claimant's claim under Article 5 of the
Treaty moot “because it is clear that the Respondent will not meet the criteria for a lawful

expropriation."”

168. As to the timing of the envisaged expropriation, the Claimant characterises the Respondent's

assertion that it will not take place “overnight” as “overshoot[ing]” and a “gratuitous statement”
since the Respondent itself had stated thal Enkev Polska would be the last hofd-out obstructing

the construction of the Nowotargowa Street.

The Respondent's Position

169. The Respondent submits that it has not taken any measures which have deprived the Claimant

of its shareholdings or the rights derived therefrom. The Claimant still holds its shares and

controlling majority in Enkev Polska, and continues to be # “very successful and profitable

company.""” Therefore, to the Respondent, there has been no direct deprivation of the

Claimant's investment and, consequently, no violation of Article 5 of the Treaty.'”

170. Nor, so it continues, has the Respondent caused any indirect deprivation, because Enkey Polska
continues to operate the facilities lacated at the £.4dz Premises, including all its machinery. To
establish an indirect deprivation, the Claimant must demonstrate the occurrence of substantial
harm, which is not shown here.’*' The 2013 Expropriation Request filed by the City of Lédé
could not in and of itself constitute a deprivation to Enkey Polska as Enkev Palska is still able
to use, enjoy and dispose of its assets.'"? Thus, according to the Respondent, the Claimant’s
claim under Article 5 of the Treaty was based on a purely “hypothetical expropriation
scenario.“!*

171. The Respondent admits that it intends to expropriate the Lodz Premises but emphasises that the
envisaged expropriation will not take place “overnight.” In its submission, it has taken all
preparatory steps necessary under Polish law and has engaged in good faith negotiations to find
an alternative location for the LGdZ Premises although it was not obliged to do so. It insists that,
even if the exprapriation decision were to be rendered with immediate enforceability, this
decision does not imply that the bulldozers will arrive the following day 1o demolish the
facilities.‘“* The Respandent therefore rejects the Claimant’s argument that its conduct gives

rise to a breach of the Treaty.'**

172. The Respondent concludes that, since no expropriation has taken place, the ‘Tribunal need not

tum to the requirements for lawful expropriations under Article 5(a}{c) of the Treaty.’
Nevertheless, should the Tribunal admit the Claimant’s claim under Article 5 of the Treaty, the
Respondent submits in the alternative that the envisaged expropriation will meet all the criteria

of a legal expropriation under Article 5 of the Treaty, in particular, those requiring (i) a public

2. Public Interest under Article 5(a) of the Treaty

The Claimant's Position

173. With regard to the purpose (or “interest") of the anticipated expropriation, the Claimant

contends that the Respondent has changed its position several times, invoking on the one hand
the construction of a new public road and on the other hand the construction of the Camerimage
Centre.'“* The letter of 17 October 2012 from the City of Lddz had, according to the Claimant,

 

the purpose of ioning the Claimant’s 2011 application to convert its
usufruct right to full ownership, which could not constitute a valid public purpose for

expropriatory measures under the Treaty."?

174. The Claimant acknowledges that road construction may be a valid public purpose for an

expropriation of property. However, it submits “that the Respondent's conduct in the present
case demonstrates that this purpose is invalid" because there has not been a consistent public
Purpose since 1993. In support of that contention, the Claimant relies on a statement made by
the Mayor of Lodz (Ms. Zdanowska} on 7 May 2012:

To be true, former authorities may have had other guiding targets to lead this road in this
tine and not in any other line, because, indeed, the road cauld have been bent differently
and your Company could be left/spared — but at the time the idea was to take over the land,
nothing else.'®

175. According to the Claimant’s interpretation of this statement, Ms. Zdanowska there admitted

Cu

(68

that the previous City administration had changed the trajectory of the Nowotargowa Street

despite the possibility of using the existing Targowa Steet.’ The Claimant maintains that
using the existing Targowa Street would have been an available option for the City which
would not have affected adversely the Claimant's use of the L4dZ Premises. In other words,

bending the Nowotargowa Street as to run through those Premises, was not necessary."

In the Claimant's submission, the Resp cannot now downplay Ms. S
statement by arguing that she had only a one-sided picture of the controversy. She gained her
“ample knowledge” from sources available to her as a Member of Parliament and as Mayor of
Lédz (holding the latter position since December 2010).’™* Equally important for the Claimant
is the fact that Ms. Zdanowska did not dispute or retract her written statement during her oral

testimony at the hearing.'*

With regard to the City's planned modemisation as a valid public purpose for expropriation, the
Claimant questions whether the City would actually be able to complete that modernisation,
arguing that “it is not a given that this project will yo ahead, and [it] has never been a given that

the City of Lodz would undertake its ‘big modemisation’.""**

According to the Claimant, the construction of a road funded by the EU Infrastructure and
Operational P cannot be ly pi by the dent as a

application had been prepared by the City of t.6d%."° The Claimant repeats its request that the

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent agrees with the Claimant that, to constitute a lawful expropriation under
Anicle 5 of the Treaty, an expropriation measure must be taken in the public interest (or, with
its synonym here, purpose). However. the Respondent maintains that host States enjoy
significant discretion to decide which purposes they consider to be valid public purposes and
that such a decision is subject to limited scrutiny by international arbitral tribunals under a
BIT. The Respondent also notes that “it is accepted that a [S]tate may expropriate property to
facilitate private economic development projects for the purpose of urban revitalisation.’

The relevant time to assess the public purpose of a measure is, according to the Respondent, the
date of the expropriation. “[Tjhe fact that [a] government's determination of a publie purpose
[changes later] does not prove that the earlier determination was not made in good faith." A
change in public purpose over time could, therefore, not affect the legality of an expropriation

as long as a valid public purpose existed at the time of the actual taking.'**

The Respondent submits that the purpose of the expected expropriation is the construction of
the Nowotargowa Street—a public investment of the City of Lodz which would “be to the
benefit of all Lédé inhabitants."" Whilst acknowledging that the City considered other
purposes previously (such as the proposed new cultural centre), the Respondent contends that
the construction of the new road was the primary purpose already in the 1977 Spatial Plan!’ or
“at least since 1993.”'® That Nowotargowa Street was projected to go through the Lédé
Premises already in the 1940s; and its exact trajectory has only “slightly changed over time."
Even if this purpose had changed materially over time, the City of Lédz was “fully authorised
to alter or redefine its public purpose” because, according to the Respondent, the relevant time
for the consideration of any public purpose is the date of the expropriatory decision.

Regardless, the Respondent maintains that the trajectory of the Nowotargowa Street as depicted

in the 1993 Spatial Plan nat only interfered with the left part of the Lédé Premises cutting
through office buildings, but that it also cut through production facilities.!”

183. The Respondent makes the following submission, here best cited in full:

There was a good reason to shifl the Nowotargowa Streel eastward, so that it is now
planned (o run through the middle and not, as envisaged in the 1993 [Spatial] Plan, through
the lefi section of the Lodé Premises. As testified by ; the city architect of Ladd,
the primary reason for the change of the road trajectory was the construction of the new
Lé6dz Fabryczna railway station in a slightly different location than the previous station
{..J. This shift, in turn, enforced moving the Nowotorgowa Street trajectory to the middle
section of the Lédé Premises, The road cannot now min merely as an extension of the
Targowa Street because it would clearly interfere with the east bank of the new milway
station,

184. According to the Respondent, an extension or widening of Targowa Street would have an

impact not only on the remodeled railway station, but it would also inevitably destroy the

historical buildings alongside the street.'”

185. The Respondent submits that the statement made by Ms. Zdanowska on 7 May 2012

(coneeming Exhibits C-141 and C-142) was made on the basis of incomplete information
provided to her by Enkev Polska.'” Ms, Zdanowska testified at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and
Liability that the only source of her knowicdge was her contact with Enkev Polska at the time
when she was a Member of Parliament (i... before 2010).' She was neither familiar with the
planning documents, the technical documentation, nor the political options available with
regard to the Targowa Street when making her statement on 7 May 2012.' Asked about the
meaning of hey statement, Ms. Zdanowska further explained:

I said so solely on the premise that when these decisions were taken, and that was carly in

1993, when the concept of establishing ihe Nowotargowa Street was bom, if it was

considered that ather entities would be affected by this decision, the road could have been
directed in a different manner.'

She expressed the vicw that once a plan for a new road was fixed in accordance with “public
expectations,” the public authorities in charge should adhere to those plans for the sake of

predictability and continuing legal certainty.'”

186. According to the Respondent, the City’s modernisation has been planned since at least 1949.'

A concrete concept for remodeling the City centre emerged in 2002 and took the form of a legal
act in 2007, namely the 2007 Resolution.’” 11 entailed an area of 90 hectares” within which

the Nowatargowa Street would provide the principal access to the new railway station."

187. For the Respondent, a further important factor for consideration is that 59 percent of the costs

for the modemisation of the City of Lédz would be contributed by the EU Infrastructure and
Environment Operational Programme. The Respondent contends that the City will receive the
EU grant only if it completes the modernisation project of the City centre by about June/July
2015.'* As the timely expropriation of the L4dé Premises is crucial for the approval of the EU
grant, the City cannot allow Enkev Polska to continue to use the Lodz Premises until the end of
2015." Any delay of the implementation of the City's modernisation project would, according
to the Respondent, not only threaten EU funding but would also exclude the City of Lédz from
any EU funding for the next 36 months, precipitating serious financial consequences for the

City.'™

private company in need of more time to leave its premises would most likely not qualify as

!89. The Respondent states that a draft application for the EU infrastructure and Environment
Operalional Programme was submitted by the Ciry of Lodz in December 2011 and was
subsequently supplemented with information requested by the EU. The finalised application
was made at ihe end of June 2013." The exact status of the application is immaterial to this
arbitration, because the time pressure to complete the modernisation af the City centre remains

the same,"**
3. Due Process of Law under Article 5(a) of the Treaty

The Claimant's Position

190. The Claimant contends that the Road Legislation is a “draconian expropriation instrument” that

violates ils due process rights for three reasons.'*°

s

First, the Road Legislation is primarily focused on “ensur[ing] that a construction project
moves forward” allowing Polish authorities substantial latitude to act on the ane hand while
largely neglecting the legitimate interests of the aggrieved party.'® For instance, it requires the
competent Polish authorities to act by certain latest dates only. However, since the authorities
can act more quickly, the application of the Road Legislation creates serious uncertainties as to
whether and when an expropriation decision will be executed.!"" The Road Legislation gives

the city discretionary room for nearly each procedural step.'

192, Second, Article 17, paragraphs {1) and (3), of the Road Legislation allow for immediately

193

enforecable decisions.'** Whilst the Respondent submits that immediate enforceability would

be the exception rather than the rule, the Claimant suggests that the practical] reality is here the

exact reverse.'* In the Claimant’s submission, the purpose of declaring an expropriation
decision immediately cnforceable is to allow for its immediate execution even if the
expropriation decision is not yet final. In such a case, the decision could be revoked in higher

cour, but, importantly, the practical effects of the execution could not be reversed.’

Lastly, Article 31(2) of the Road Legislation provides for a fast track procedure to implement
the expropriation decision which is declared immediately enforceable under Article 17 of the
Road Legislation.’ It is the Claimant’s case that Article 31(2) of the Road Legislation prevents
affected individuals from secking effective recourse in administrative courts once construction
work has begun.’ It contends that as an expert witness on Polish administrative
law, confirmed “that it is virtually impossible to go to court and have {a} suspension {...} of the
execution of an expropriation decision” granted.'* It is, according to the Claimant, also

impossible (o receive a “provisional halting measure in Polish civil proceedings."

The Respondent's Position

194. The Respondent rejects the Claimant's assertion that it has violated the Claimant’s due process

rights since the application for expropriation was only submitted in January 2013 and was then
sent back to the City of Lédé. Therefore, it is the Respondent's position that “due process”

“either has just been commenced or even [did not] commence.”?”

195. With respect to the Claimant's argument that the Road Legislation violates its due process

rights. the Respondent submits that the Claimant's description of the application of the Road
Legislation “lacks objectivity.*”°' The Respondent contends that the discretion granted to Polish
authorities reflects common practice in administrative procedures (in Poland as elsewhere in

other European countries).

196. According to the Respondent, the possibility to render an immediately enforceable
expropriatory decision under Article 17 of the Road Legislation only applies in situations in
which an important public, social or economic interest prevails over the interest of the
aggrieved party. Although the City of Lédz made a request for an immediately enforceable
expropriation decision with respect to the L6dz Premises on 28 January 2013, under Polish law
the default position is rather “a scenario without immediate enforceability." Even if the
expropriation decision were made with immediate enforceability, it would not be possible for
the City’s bulldozers to enter the L6dz Premises and start their demolition the following day.
As a matter of Polish law, the owner of the affected real property has 30 days to vacate that
property; and, if it fails to do so, a bailiff procedure is initiated which can last “another several
dozen days.” so that the practical implementation of an expropriation decision with immediate
enforceability may be considerably extended, depending on the conduct of the owner of the real

property.”

197. The Claimant's position that the immediate enforceability of an expropriation decision is the
rule rather than the exception under Polish law is, according to the Respondent, unsupported
and “fully unmerited."””* If is also inconsistent since the Claimant has made only a hypothetical
claim under Article $ of the Treaty, i.e., the legal provisions have not yet been applied in
practice to Enkev Polska (or the Claimant)?” Thus, so it concludes, there is no basis for
assuming, that the practical reality would be immediate enforceability of any expropriation

decision.

198. The Respondent submits further that the Claimant's complaint regarding the absence of
effective judicial remedies once the construction work has started is misinformed. Affected
individuals could claim compensation from the Polish State if the Polish administrative courts
found that the expropriation decision with immediate enforceability was unlawful. Such
compensation would cover both actual damage and lost profits so that the aggrieved party
ultimately would be put in the same position as if there had been no expropriation decision.”
The Respondent contends that the rationale behind Article 31(2) of the Road Legislation is that,
once the construction of a road has begun and (say) had lasted for two weeks or so, efficiency

and cost factors would dictate that the construction work ought to be continued, rather than

reversed. Finally, the Respondent contends that the Claimant confuses compensation to be
paid for an expropriation as compared to conipensation for an expropriation decision declared
illegal. The latter is “not limited to the value—be it sales or replacement—of the expropriated

premises, but covers any damage or loss suffered.”

As a general submission, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has a flawed
understanding of procedures under Polish law as regards, first, spatial planning procedures?!”

and second, expropriation an administrative procedures.”

4, Undertakings under Article 5(b) of the Treaty
The Claimant's Position

The Claimant contrasts the wording of Article 3(5) and Article $(b) of the Treaty. Article 3(5}
sefers to “any obligations entered into” while Article 5(b) refers to “any undertaking.”
Therefore, so the Claimant concludes, Asticle 5(b) contains a lower threshold to trigger a host
State’s international responsibility than Article 3(5). Put differently, the Claimant submits that
the explicit reference to “any undestaking” in Article 5(b) establishes an additional condition
for the legality of the taking of property under the Treaty.?””

The Claimant submits further that the Respondent made assurances that qualify as undertakings

within the meaning of Article 5(b) of the Treaty. In particular, it refers to an email message of

25 November 2009 sent by of the Camerimage Centre the City of LédZ to
of the Claimant, headed “Enkev relocation negotiations,” which states, infer
alia:
T wish to reassure you that, accordinu to the will of the President of the City of Ladz, the
negotiations regarding the relocation of your facility will be continued until [...} positive
final results are achieved for both sides.”*
The Claimant emphasises that « (identified in the message as the City’s legal
adviser representing the City, with ~ ) did not deny at the Hearing on Jurisdiction

and Liability that the document evidenced an offer 10 negotiate with Enkcv. If the message had

been incorrect, Ms. Zdanowska would have corrected it or protested against her involvement at

the time?4

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent objects to the Claimant's interpretation of “undertaking” under Article 5(b) of
the Treaty. !t contends that confirmed that the Respondent did not enter into
any stabilisation clause with the Respondent in regard to Polish law, neither prior nor
subsequent to its first acquisition of the shares in 2001. In light of the absence of any
undertaking by the Respondent and also the fact that Poland was a developing country
undergoing a significant period of political and economic transition, the Respondent submits
that the Claimant could not reasonably expect that Poland’s law on expropriation would never

change.

Further, the message of 25 November 2009 sent on behalf of the City of Lodz to
cannot be reasonably interpreted as a binding obligation upon the Respondent to continue

negotiations endlessly towards the result satisfactory for the Claimant."

5. Just Compensation under Article 5(c)
The Claimant's Position

The Claimant makes four observations on the legal materials dealing with the question of
compensation for expropriation. First, according to the Claimant, Polish law allows for

p ‘ion based on the rep value of an i in cases where no market value
can be established.””” The Claimant urges the Tribunal to apply this valuation method which
envisages compensation that would allow Enkev Polska to move ta an equivalent location. In
the Claimant's words, the relocation value is “the amount necessary to replace the investment

prior to the injurious acts,""!?

Second, since the Treaty term “just compensation” is linked to the terms “real value” and
“cffective,” the Tribunal should not apply the fair market value mechanically, In the present
case, so the Claimant submits, the relocation value would be the appropriate standard since it

captures not only the real value of the investment but also buildings, fixtures and machinery on

the Premises,” “Fair market value,” representing the sales value of an investment at a
particular date, would not by itself constitute just compensation should Enkev Polska have to
relocate (as it must). Should the Tribunal decide to apply a fair market value standard, the
Claimant requests the Tribunal to take into account the “potential of change in use of the

property,” its strategic value and the cost of the buildings themselves.””!

According to the Claimant, a valuation method based on the market value would be insufficient
to meet the Treaty’s requirement in the present case since the Lédé Premises have special
features such as their strategic location in the City centre; buildings which meet the Claimant's
needs and enable it to produce goods in an efficient and reliable manner; and the uniqueness of
Enkev Polska’s business in the region.” “Enkev's excelient fit in the present location and the
unlikely fit for any other company” are “unique advantages [which] make market prices
[unsuitablej. [...] In the absence of an actual market[,] factors such [as the] costs of ‘obtaining a

functional substitute’ ought to be taken into account. The Claimant maintains that only a
valuation based on replacement value would appropriately capture these unique circumstances.
Thus, the calculation of just compensation in the present case must comprise (i) the land
holding: (i) the buildings on the land; (iii) the machinery and equipment; (iv) the actual
relocation costs; and (v) compensation for the costs of business interruption and further

commercial damages.”

Third, ihe Claimant contends that deprivation in the present case can be characterised as
unlawful. Therefore, the Claimant invokes Article 36(2) of the Intemational Law Commission
Drafi Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationaily Wrongful Acts (“ILC Draft
Articles”) with regard to the calculation of compensation for unlawful expropriation,”> which
reads:

2. The compensation {for an intemationally wrongful act] shall cover any financially
assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.

If the Tribunal were to distinguish actual loss from lost profits, the Claimant relies on the
Commentary to Article 36 of the ILC Draft Articles to make clear that, in the case of the
expropriation of a factory, the actual loss includes the land, buildings and equipment of that
factory. The JLC Commentary further confirms, in the Claimant’s submission, that the
assessment becomes more complicated where the investment is of a unique or unusual nature.
Especially in cases where business entities are concemed, their goodwill and profitability

should be included in the caiculation.**

Finally, the Claimant relies on certain arbitral awards to contend that the Most Favoured Nation
Clause contained in Article 3(6) of the Treaty imports the more favourable compensation

standards contained in other B!Ts concluded by the Respondent ”’

Article 3(6} provides:

6. If the provision of taw of either Contracting Party or obtigations under international
law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in
addition to this Treaty contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling
investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable
than is provided for by this Treaty, such regulation shall to the extent that it is more
favourable prevail over this Treaty.
The Claimant refer to a number of BITs between the Respondent and other States, such as the
United Arab Emirates, Chile, Australia, Argentina, Portugal and India. The Claimant
emphasises that compensation, as required by these treaties, is to be sufficient to allow Enkev
Polska to carry on with production and also conforms with principles of international law:
“{C]ompensation shall be computed on the basis of equitable principles taking into account
inter alia the capital invested [...] replacement value, goodwill and other relevant factors.” In
the Claimant's submission, the most equitable compensation would be the value of replacing its

pecially given the knowledge of unjust application of the local laws and the

negotiations in 2009,"7”"

Although the Claimant acknowledges thal the Respondent has made several offers of relocation
and compensation, the Claimant considered al! unacceptable. The Claimant rejected the first

otfer (of 24 December 2008) because it represented only the cost of liquidating the production

facilities, but did not include costs associated with the transfer to a new location.” The second
offer (made between April and October 2010) envisaged relocation, but, according to the
Claimant, did not succeed “due to changing political circumstances in Lédé.””*! The Claimant
rejected the third offer (of May 2012) because the Claimant disagreed with several propositions
laid down in the valuation report.” In response, the Claimant submitted an estimate to the
Respondent of the compensation necessary to relocate production facilities to Konstantynov
(L6d%), as a reply to the Respondent’s second offer. The Claimant calculated that the
reconstruction of the current plant in Konstantynov would total PLN 63,645,000? and that
such a relocation would take approximately two years.***

In conclusion, the Claimant submits that the compensation offered by the Respondent for the
impending expropriation of the Premises does not meet the requirements of Article 5(c) of the
Treaty.”

The Claimant further requests the Tribunal to render a declaratory award on the interpretation
and application of Article 5(c) of the Treaty, due to a perceived lack of clarity conceming the
meaning of the term “just compensation” representing the “rea! value of the investment
affected” contained in Article 5(c) of the Treaty" It is the Claimant's position that Article 11
of the Treaty does not preclude an investor from requesting a tribunal fo issue a declaratory
award—even if a proposal for consultations between the Contracting Parties to the Treaty has
been made—because the interpretation of this Treaty is not the exclusive task of the

Contracting Parties.”

the Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that there is no need to discuss questions of compensation for three
reasons. First, the Claimant’s investment (i.e., its shareholdings in Enkev Polska) is not

threatened by any expropriation. Second, since Enkev Polska has not yet been subjected to any

expropriation decision, there can be no “measure [...] accompanied by the provision of
payment of just compensation” as required under Article 5(c) of the Treaty. According to the
Respondent, the Tribunal could not make any decisions “based on Enkev Beheer’s
apprehension of what a Polish decision maker may do or not.” The Claimant cannot prove, in
the abstract, that the envisaged expropriation will fail to meet the requirements of the Treaty.”
Third, any compensation offer by the City of L6dé was made to reach an amicable settlement

with Enkev Polska and not to meet the Treaty’s requirements.**”

216. The Respondent also reiterates that it is beyond dispute between the Parties that the City

offered “many different alternatives for a possible relocation.””' Nevertheless, the City of Lodz
remains legally entitled to apply the Road Legislation if no agreement could be reached.
Consequently, the Respondent emphasises that “this fact should not be distorted (by the
Claimant] into a ‘push to get Enkev Polska into accepting a settlement and sel] the entire Ladé

Premises substantially below the real value’."""?

217. The Respondent also rejects the Claimant's request for the declaratory interpretation and

application of Article S(c) of the Treaty, and in particular the interpretation of “just
compensation” as representing the “real valuc of the investment affected.” Jt submits that such
a request is an in abstracto request for interpretation which is reserved to the Contracting
Parties to the Treaty according to Article 11. Whilst the Tribunal’s task is the interpretation
and application of the Treaty in the present dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent,
it is the Contracting Pasties’ task to give an authoritative interpretation of the Treaty.“* The

Respondent concurs with the Claimant that declaratory relief is generally legitimate in

however, the ibility of a declaratory award as a pre-
emptive remedy is not generally accepted because it might interfere with a host State’s

sovereignty." The Respondent stresses that “[e]learly, an order to measure compensation for

preiation of “just jon,” the R d for a fair market value

Article 3(1) of the Treaty — Fair and Equitable Treatment (“FET”)

Article 31) of the Treaty reads:

Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable trearment to the investments of
investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal thereof by those investors.

The Claimant's Position

Tt is the Claimant’s submission that the term “treatment” should be interpreted broadly:
“Treatment is an expansive term, defined as ‘conduct, behaviour, action or behaviour toward a

person’.” Essentially, so it contends, “any action or omission attributable to a host State can

become the subject of an FET claim.”

The Claimant submits that it was and is still treated unfairly and inequitably by the Respondent
in violation of Article 3(1) as the Respondent has: (i) exposed the Claimant to “unreasonable
uncertainties” as fo the operation of the Lodz Premises; (ii) not provided the Claimant with
stable and predictable investment framework; (iii) subjected the Claimant to undue process
under Polish domestic procedure; and (iv) failed to act in good faith in these arbitration

procecdings.
The Respondent's Position

The Respondent interprets the FET Standard as giving investors protection against serious
instances of arbitrary, discriminatory os abusive conduct by host States which must be
considered “egregious” or “shocking” from an international perspective.” The threshold to

make a State liable under this standard is high. “Inefficiency, imperfection on a government’s

conduct and even its own domestic law does not necessarily amount to a breach of [that
standard]."”° The Respondent observes that the expectations of an investor must be legitimate
and reasonable, taking into consideration “(i) any specific representations or commitments
made by the State to the investor [...], (ii) the presumption that the investor is aware of the
general regulatory framework in the host [S]tate; and balancing the investor’s legitimate

expectations against the legitimate regulatory activities of the State.” *!

223. It is the Respondent’s case that the Claimant has failed ta demonstrate that the Respondent’s

conduct amounted to any breach of the FET Standard. The Respondent maintains that its
actions and inactions toward Enkev Polska (rather than those directed toward the Claimant
itself) are of no relevance to the Claimant’s claims. Since the Claimant has not established that
its shareholding in Enkey Polska has been affected, the Respondent submits there was no
breach of Article 3(1) of the Treaty. In the alternative, the Respondent contends that both the

Claimant and Enkey Polska were treated fairly.”*?

1, Unreasonable Uncertainties

The Claimant's Position

224. The Claimant contends that the Respondent created unreasonable uncertainty by invoking more

than one purpose to justify the Premises’ expected expropriation. As a consequence of this
uncertainty, the Claimant maintains that it has not been able to conduct its business in a normat
fashion and to invest in new business opportunities.“ Ms. Zdanowska acknowledged,
according to the Claimant, that Enkey Polska was left in a state of uncertainty and that the root
of the conflict between Enkev and the City of Lodz was. in her opinion, that “the company

could not develop. The situation blocked its possibility to grow.**

225. Moreover, the Claimant maintains that the repeated threals to expropriate the Lédz Premises

were “made, kept alive for extended periods of time and then not followed up” causing
unreasonable uncertainty regarding the status of the investment in breach of Article 3(1) of the

156

Treaty.” The Claimant characterises the “frequently changing attitudes and policies” as

“unacceptable behaviour in light of [...] the legitimate expectations of an investor in a
sophisticated European country” which would undermine the predictability of the legal
investment framework.2*”

The Claimant puts special emphasis on the “expropriation threat” in the City’s letter of
17 October 2012 to Enkev Polska,”* which, in the Claimant's submission, envisaged an
expropriation with immediate effect (on 19 October 2012}, allowing Enkev Polska a mere two-
day notice to vacate the Lodz Premises. The Claimant contends that, at that time, the City was
about to decide on Enkey Polska’s application, made in November 2011, to convert its
perpetual usufruct right regarding the Lodz Premises to full ownership. This apptication
“apparently provided the direct impetus for kicking Enkev into a comer.”*° The Claimant
immediately informed the Respondent’s Government in Warsaw by e-mail messages of 19 and
24 October 2012. The Claimant contends that the failure “to respond adequately to actions
dnown to be harassing/threatening Enkev also constitutes, in and by itself, a failure to provide
for fair and equitable treatment of Enkev’s investment and to provide Enkev with full security

and protection of its investment.”?

The Claimant contends that ihe Respondent attempts to “disguise” the expropriation threats that

2 During a meeting on 9 July 2012, for instance,

put it under duress as good faith negotiations.’
the City representative (Mr. Nita) stated: “in clear word[s] that an expropriation decision with
an order of immediate enforceability would [...] take place immediately.”"? Enkev Polska
{assisted by the Dutch Vice-Prime Minister and the Dutch Embassy) articulated clearly to the
City that it perceived the communications as threats.” These threats and changing deadtines

1264

created unreasonable uncertainty for the Claimant.“ Morcover, this characterisation stands, in

the Claimant’s submission, in contrast to the statement made by Mr. Cieslak who testified that

the postponement was “a result of the situation on the building site and the progress of the work
nlss

there,
In addition, the Claimant submits that the lack of information regarding the planned road
construction and remedial works, as well as the lack of transparency of decision-making
processes, inhibited its oversight over ihe present and future operations of Enkev Polska at the
Lodé Premises.” Jt contends that, while the Respondent withheld information repeatedly
sought by the Claimant, it nonetheless reported on the timing of construction work and the

details of this arbitration to the Polish media.”

The Claimant submits that the lack of information not only hampered the planning required for
the operation of the Lodz Premises, but also impeded the Claimant’s position in these
arbitration proceedings. The Claimant refers, for example, to the Respondent’s failure to

produce documents and to respond to clarifications sought by the Claimant. In the Claimant’s

 

bmission, this 4 d the R “evasive actions” and “diffuse
269

information sharing.
It is the Claimant's position that the Respondent’s unresponsiveness during the negotiation
phase preceding this arbitration prevented the Claimant from mitigating damages.” The
Claimant contacted the City of Lédé and PalilZ on 9 July 2012 with a request to provide
information regarding the mitigation of damages by 15 July 2012, cmphasising that a failure to
reply would be considered as a release from the Claimant’s obligation to mitigate its loss. As a
result of the lack of response, the Claimant contends that it could not be reasonably expected to
mitigate damages. Leaving the Lédz Premises was not an option, in the Claimant's submission,

since the Claimant would need “at least minimal compensation, time and a location to go to,"”"

The Respondent's Position

The Respandent contends that the purpose of the City’s envisaged expropriation has always
been the construction of a new public road and that this idea emerged “much earlier than the
adaption of the [1993 Spatial Plan].” While admitting that the City had earlier plans to use the
remaining parts of the Lédd Premises for the construction of the Camerimage Centre (that were
eventually abandoned), the Respondent contends that the plan to construct a new road remained
consistent. The fact that the public purpose for a plan regarding adjacent plots changed has no
bearing on the present case since the City of Ldé abandoned this plan and still seeks to
expropriate a part of the Lédé Premises necessary for the construction of the Nowotargowa
Street”

232. The Respondent disputes that the discussions between Enkey Polska and the City of Lédz

constituted “threats” of expropriation.” According to the Respondent, these discussions
amounted only to “announcements by civil servants of the City of Lédé that in case no out-of-
court fie., amicable] settlement would be reached with respect to the Lédz Premises, the City
of Lédé would proceed with the statutory expropriation procedure.” The Respondent

maintains these are “statements of fact.”?”*

233. The Respondent emphasises that the deadlines for expropriation must be strictly distinguished

from deadlines for the acceptance of the purchase offers for the Lodz Premises.*” The deadline
set during the meeting on 20 July 2012, for instance, was a deadline for accepting the purchase
offer after which an expropriation procedure could have been initiated by the City. The reason
for postponing these deadlines was the City's continuing desire to reach a negotiated solution
acceptable to all Parties?” According to Mr. Nita, the postponement was “a favour [...] fo

made at the request by Enkey Polska itself."° The Claimant cannot now abuse the City’s

goodwill wrongly to construct a breach of the Treaty’s Fair and Equitable Standard."

234. The Respondent further disputes that the extensions of deadlines for the acceptance of the

purchase offers resulted in uncertainties for the Claimant, since the City made arrangements for

additional re-valuations of the Premises.”?

235. It is the Respondent's position that the City's goodwill towards Enkev Polska to negotiate is

now being unfairly distorted by the Claimant in its attempt to show that the decision not to
expropriate immediately amounted to a breach of Articles 3(1) and 3(2) of the Treaty. The
Respondent submits that, first, the Cily was not obliged under Polish law to engage in any
negotiations with Enkev Polska before an expropriation decision"? Second, the intention
behind these negotiations was to find a substitute location for Enkev Polska, thus, keeping it in

L6dé and maintaining the employment of some 200 local employees.”™* Third, the negotiations

were, in the R os dina

p always iP manner. In p

the City of Lodz’s position that the trajectory of the Nowotargowa Street could not in practice
be altered (after the 2010 Decision on Environmental Conditions) remained unchanged
throughout the negotiations with Enkev Polska. Even then, the representatives of the City of
£6dz articulated iheir impression that the Dutch shareholders of Enkev Polska were not
sufficiently informed of the processes regarding the City’s spatial planning by their Polish

counterparts.**

236. The Respondent disputes that the City’s letter of 17 October 2012 can be characterised as a

220

threat of expropriation. It notes that “{pJrobably the reference to the immediate commencement
of the expropriation procedure [...] was not the most fortunate one, but definitively it was not
the City’s intention to threaten Enkev Polska.”*** According to the Respondent, the letter of
17 October 2012 must be read in context of the meeting of 13 September 2012 where the

Parties jointly agreed to a re-valuation of the Lodé Premises." Enkev Polska’s application to

convert its perpetual usufruct right to fuli ownership caused uncertainty as to the jegal status of
the Lédz Premises. This “unregulated legal status” would have had substantial impact on the
value of the Premises, thus, hindering its envisaged re-evaluation.* To avoid further delay in
the re-valuation (and by the same token delay in the implementation of the City’s
modemisation project), the letter was meant to encourage Enkev Polska”? and to serve as a

reminder to proceed with the joint re-valuation of the Lodz Premises.”

The Respondent submits that the City applied for expropriation only on 28 January 2013
because the negotiations for the voluntary purchase of the Enkev Polska’s premises remained

fruitless, after nearly a decade.”*!

However, the Respondent submits that “[{mJere
announcements that the City of Lodz wishes to expropriate the L.6dz Premises do not constitute

a breach of the FET standard."

The Respondent also rejects the contention that it ignored the Claimant's requests for
information, The Claimant had access to “extensive information” on the City’s planning
through publicly available documents. The City also provided Enkev Polska with documents,
including but not limited to: (2) a general schedule to construction works in the L6dz inner city;
(ij) information on funding of the modemisation project; (ij) a draft application for the EU
funds; fv} architectural and planning documentation; and (v) valuation reports 7"?

The Claimant's reference to certain media reports given to the Polish media by the City of Lodé
had no effect on this arbitration, for wo reasons. First, they entailed no subjective comments as
to the substance of the claim and did not go beyond objective, basic information on these
arbitration proceedings. Second, aif the reports were made before the Tribunal requested the
Parties not unnecessarily to aggravate the dispute during the Hearing on Interim Measures on
13 February 2013."

2. Stable and Predictable lnvestment Framework
The Claimant's Position

The Claimant submits that, after its investment had first been made in 2001, the Respondent
introduced radical changes to the Polish fega} landscape by enacting the Road Legislation in
2003. The Claimant submits that the subsequent application of the Road Legislation to Enkev

Polska “further deteriorate[ed} the legal regime.*?”*

According to the Claimant, the City of Lédz created “legitimate expectations of stability of its
investment” by giving specific representations and assurances which should be honoured.”
It is the Claimant's case that the Respondent's arguments regarding the limitations on an
investor’s legitimate expectations are misplaced. In particular, the Claimant disputes: (i) that
the legal instruments for public purpose expropriations were already available under Polish law
at the time of its first investment in 2001; (ii) that (he Claimant had to expect the introduction of
the Road Legislation since Poland was a country in transition at that time; and (iii) that
investors generally cannot expect the Iegal system of the host State to remain unchanged.”” The
Claimant submits that the speed of expropriation proceedings and the “severe limitation of
rights of the affected parties" were first introduced by the Road Legislation.”™ The Claimant
conchides that:

it is too long a shot for Poland to effectively argue that Enkev should have known all along

that the piece of legislation (i) was only introduced after Enkev's first investments, (ii) was

intended to be in place for a few years, (iit) radically changed in 2006 and 2008 (as

Respondent acknowledged), (iv) was highly controversial in several respects over the years

and to date, (v) was recently challenged by the national Ombudsman before the

Constitutional Court, and (vi) ied to a Constitutional Court judgment in which that court

confirmed that legal means aiming at saving ownership actually should remain illusory,
should have been accounted for by Enkev in making and continuing its investments

 

According to the Claimant, the 2002 Study confirmed the trajectory of the Targowa Street as
described in the 1993 Spatial Plan, cutting slightly the left part of the Lddz Premises where

office buildings were located. The corridor of the Targowa Street as projected in the 2002

Study was only extended and did not, according to the Claimant, cut through the middle of the

Lodz Premises.”

In the Claimant’s submission, it is clear that the street trajectory has shifted from the projected
path in 2002 by comparing the most recent depiction to the plans in place as late as 2007." On
8 January 2007, the Mayor of Lédé issued a WZ-decision that permitted Enkev Polska to
expand its warehouse capacity on the L6od2 Premises.*” At that time, the warehouse was
already located where the trajectory of the Nowotargowa Street is currently planned. The
Claimant submits that the W2Z-decision could not have been granted “if it had been
incompatible with an applicable study or a zoning plan that would have directed a road on that
bit of land.*” According to the Claimant, the City decided in 2007 to remodel the existing
railway station, precipitating the shift in the trajectory. The new station would require
considerably more space compared to the existing one and, since the City intended to protect
the buildings to the west of the existing station, the corridor of the Targowa Street had to be

moved eastward.?™

The Claimant concludes that, on the basis of the planning documents and legislative framework
in force in 2001, it could not have reasonably expected that the City of Lodz would expropriate

the Lédé Premises."

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent concurs that the FET Standard comprises a host State’s obligation to provide a
stable and predictable investment environment, but notes that: “investors should legitimately

expect regulations to change over time as an aspect of the normai operation of [the] legal and

31306

policy process of the economy they operate inj” and, panicularly, “in the absence of any

representations given by the respondent State, the investor could not reasonably [expect] that

2307

such regulatory changes would not occur.””” According to the Respondent, the FET Standard

does not, therefore, prevent a host State from introducing legislative changes adverse to an

investor,

247. The Respondent coniests the Claimant’s assertion that the Respondent did not provide a stable

and predictable investment framework, for three reasons. First, the Respondent did not give any
or

2001 (the time of the Claimant’s initial acquisition of shares), nor in 2005 nor in 2009 (the time

ing the legal p: ditions for expropriations, neither in

of the two subsequent acquisitions). Second, no such assurance could be derived from Polish
laws in force at that time. Third, Polish law permitted the envisaged expropriation “well before

Enkev Beheer made its investment in Lada.

248, Further, the Respondent contends that the Claimant should have been aware that Poland was in

transition in 2001, “only twelve years after the collapse of the communism and three years

before joining the European Union,~"

and that it could not have expected the same legal and
business standards as in Western European countries, During 200) and 2009, it was known that
Poland was “in heavy need for infrastructure development, including, in the first place, roads,
railways and public transport." According to the Respondent, it was also commonly known
that the Act on Real Estate Management then in place (which regulated expropriations for
public purposes) did not allow for the efficient implementation of infrastructure projects, so that
a prudent investor should have expected legislative changes.*”” The Respondent contends that
the legal situation at the time of Claimant's first investment (in 200]} was such that it must
have anticipated that the L6dz Premises might be affected at a [ater time by legislative

changes.?

249. The Respondent submits that, contrary to the Claimant's contention, the 1993 Spatial Plan

already projected a road cutting through the Lddz Premises,"

According to the Respondent,

2001.5 It must therefore be presumed that the Ciaimant included the risk of being affected by

subsequent legislative changes into its legitimate expectations.’

The Respondent contends that the WZ-decision, which allowed Enkev Polska to extend its
warehouse space, had already been issued on 16 September 2005 (not 2007) and contained
“unambiguous information that there [was] a junction road planned to run over the LédZ
Premises. Further, it made clear that, although the fina] trajectory had not yet been decided by
the City, there were two versions being considered, each of which was to cut through the pian
for extended production.” Therefore, the Respondent concludes that the Claimant must have
known of the City’s plans in 2005.

The Respondent agrees with the Claimant that the entry into force of the Road Legislation in
2003 marked a “radical change,” because expropriation proceedings with the public purpose of
facilitating road constructions became easier than general expropriation proceedings under
Polish law.*"* However, the Respondent submits that the entry into force of the Road

Legislation is materially irretevant for the assessment of a Treaty breach for three reasons.

First, although the Road Legislation did not yet exist at the moment of the Claimant's
investment in 2001, ils underlying goa! in fact did exist, namely the revitalisation of the City
centre. in the Respondent’s submission, this goal represents the public purpose, while the Road
Legislation represents the only instrument to implement that public purpose.*'® The Respondent
emphasises that already in 200] there were other legal instruments in force which could have
led to the Premises’ expropriation and, thus, limited any legitimate expectations of the
Claimant." Second, the Claimant effectively accepted the Road Legislation by acquiring
further shares in Enkev Polska in 2005 and 2009 despite being aware of the legislative

253, Thus, the Respondent contends that the Claimant cannot shift responsibitity for the risks it took

or underestimated at the time of ils investments in 2001, 2005 and 2009. The Claimant's “lack
of due care for its business affairs may not simply be remedied by extending the host [S}iate’s
duties beyond the [BIT] standards."*>

3. Due Process

The Claimant's Position

254. The Claimant submits that the Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure violated its due

to

process rights under the Treaty. Though the Claimant did not participate in the Proeedure in
2010 (because, the Claimant maintains, it did not know about the Procedure at the time}, the
Claimant submits that, if it had participated, its contribution would not have had any
fundamental impact on the planning of the Nowotargowa Street. ]t quotes the Director of the
Road and Transportation Authority of Lodz (Mr. Nita) stating that “the Claimant’s
participation] may have moved the road by a couple of meters only, but [the] road would be

constructed any way.”*?*

55. The Claimant further submits that providing the Environmental [mpact Assessment Procedure

as the only opportunity for it to lobby the City for a change in the development plan constitutes
a denial of justice.” since the Procedure would typically assess technical, social or natural
impacts on the environment. Economic interests fall, according to the Claimant, outside the

scope of the Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure.”

256. Its rights were further violated. the Claimant submits, by the Road Legislation’s limited

recourse to administrative courts.”

The Respondent's Position

257. The Respondent contends that the Claimant acted “reckless[ly]” when making its first

investment in 2001 as it failed to properly investigate the status of the Lodz Premises and the

related planning documents. It would have discovered that: (i) the title to the LOdz Premises

consultations conceming the content of the 2010 Study as well as that of the 2010 Decision on
Environmental Conditions."? Enkev Polska’s admitted failure to participate in these
consultations is not, in the Respondent's submission, excused by arguing that it did not receive
a special notification from the City of Lodz. Under the applicable law, the commencement of
the Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure is made public by general public
announcements.*° The Respondent contends that the commencement of the Environmental
Impact Assessment Procedure was announced on the blackboard and the website of the City of
Lédé with a clear reference to the construction of the railway station and passenger traffic
service.”"! The fact that Enkcv Polska’s neighbours took part in these proceedings shows, in the
R "s submission, that the was properly icated to the general

public”

The Respondent maintains also that the Claimant makes several incorrect and unsupported
statements about the possible effecis of its participation in the 2010 Environmental Impact
Assessment Procedure. It disagrees that the Claimant’s participation in this Procedure could not
have resulted in a change of the trajectory of the planned road.3? Contrary to the Claimant's
contention, the Respondent submits that the Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure was
not limited to technical, social or natural impacts “but extend[ed] also to links with the existing

transportation system and its interaction with the environment around it."”™*

260. The Respondent further asserts that, in light of periodic mectings with the City's

representatives, “Enkev Polska had full knowledge of the Lédz plans regarding its premises [so
that] the Claimant may not simply [...] try to push the burden of its own omissions onto the

Respondent." If il did not have such knowledge at thal time, the Respondent reiterates that it

ought to have gained such knowledge on its own by investigating and seeking legal advice,

rather than expecting to be informed personally by the City.
The Respondent notes that the City of Lédz is in the process of devising a new spatial plan. The
Respondent emphasises that the announcements concerning the commencement of the planning
of a new spatia) plan were made in the same way as the announcements to participate in the
proceedings leading to the 2010 Study and the 2010 Decision on Environmental Conditions.*”
Enkev Poiska made an application in these proceedings in March 2012, despite not having been
individually invited to participate by the City. More important, the Respondent comments, is
that Enkev Poiska did not, in its application, raise any concemms with regard to the trajectory of

the Nowotargowa Street.***

4, Bad Faith
The Claimant's Position

The Claimant accuses the Respondent of acting in bad faith in these arbitration proceedings
with respect to allegedly erroneous statements regarding the application for EU funding by the
City.” The Respondent had, according to the Claimant, undertaken to provide the City’s
application once the City of Lodz had formally submitted it to the BU.“

Further, the Claimant complains about not having received certain translations and inaps from
the Respondent.’ The Claimant criticises the Respondent's map relating to the 2002 Study,
found in Exhibits R-7 (page 2) and R-71 (page 6), for being distorted.” The Claimant does not
accept the Respondent's expfanation that the map served only demonstrative purposes.
According to the Claimant, “[its] purpose must have been to wrongly establish that there had
always been a road planned over, in particular, the middle of the Lodz Premises—which

matches the current trajectory of the Nowotargowa [Street] but not the trajectory valid on the

basis of [...] the 1993 [Spatial} Plan and the 2002 Study.“ According to the Claimant, the
Respondent tried 10 demonstrate that “Enkev must have known, since 1993 or at least 2002 [...]
thai a road was planned through the very middle of the £ddz Premises."

The Claimant alleges further that the Respondent was able to produce good-quality maps when
suitable for its own purposes, such as the more detailed map of the [993 Spatial Plan.“ The
fact that not only the map of the 2002 Study but also the map of the 1993 Spatial Plan in
Exhibit R-7 are, in the Claimant's submission, incorrect leads the Claimant to conclude that (i)
the Respondent's submissions based on the planning documents “are not reliable” 346; and (ii)

the Respondent acted in bad faith in these proceedings.”

Finally, the Claimant submits that the Respondent failed adequately to react to various atlempts

by the Claimant to settle the dispute amicably since May 201224

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent maintains that it had no intention to misrepresent the facts of the case through
the use of Exhibit R-7 and R-71.%? While apologising for any confusion caused by its
presentation, the Respondent stresses that the maps on which the Claimant commented still
show that the plans tor the modemisation of the City centre were in place for decades and that
Enkev Polska's Premises had been in the area affected by the new road plans throughout this

time.

The Respondent contends that the Claimant approached its negotiations with the City in bad
faith, It submits that “Enkev Polska wanted a commercial buy[-Jout and [that] the central issue
[..-] was always money.”"! From the outset of the negotiations, the Claimant sought the grant

of modern facilities, despite the fact that the buildings on the Lédz Premises are “old and worn

down.”*” In the Respondent's submission, Enkev Polska expected the City of Lédz to pay even

more than the replacement value.

Article 3(2) of the Treaty — Full Security and Protection (“FSP”)

Article 3(2) provides:

More particularly, each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments full security and
protection which in any case shall not be less than that accorded either to investments of ils
own investors or to investments of investors of any third State, whichever is more
favourable to the investor concerned.

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant contends that Article 3(2) of the Treaty obliges the Respondent to act in a
transparent manner toward the investor.°” It submits that the Respondent failed to accord its
investment full security and protection by not:

@ intervening when the Claimant was threatened with the discontinuation of its

operations on the L6dz Premises;

di) intervening when the Claimant was pushed to sell the Léd% Premises
“substantially below real value;”

Giii} notifying the Claimant of the commencement of the Environmental Impact
Assessment Procedure despite having previously guaranteed to do so and despite
being able to do so; or

Civ) providing a stable legal framework for its investment?"

The Claimant submits that the Road Legistation violates its right to full security and protection
under Article 3(2) of the Treaty. It submits thal “[t]he Respondent (in its governmental
capacity) is ultimately responsible for enacting this legislative arrangement and should seck to
prevent application thereof in violation of the Respondent's treaty obligations.” The Claimant
submits that the Respondent used its expanded power as provided in the Road Legislation
deliberately to put pressure on the Claimant.

The Claimant next refers to “the gentlemen's agreement reached on 13 September 2012 to

conduct a re-valuation of the Lodz Premises” and follow-up contacts in which it made clear that

the re-valuation was to be based on the replacement value and the standard set in Article 5(c) of
357

the Treaty.”” According to the Claimant, it was agreed that the Parties would jointly appoint
and instruct the valuer. However, since the Respondent proposed a list of potential candidates
and instrueted the valuer unilaterally to base the valuation on the sales value only, the Claimant

refused to accept the valuer’s appointment.**

With regard to transparency, the Claimant accuses the City of Lédz of deliberately failing to
provide adequate information, despite the Claimant's repeated information requests in Polish
administrative proceedings and also in these arbitration proceedings.* The Claimant criticises
in particular that the Respondent did not proffer any reliable overview of the expropriation
proceedings instituted under the Road Legislation. [t accuses the Respondent of withholding
information and of making opaque, “ever-changing and sometimes incorrect statements” which

will ultimately damage the Claimant’s business.

Nevertheless, the Claimant underlines that the City of Lédé remains in a position to act to
“reduce (he number of breaches of its obligations under Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT.”**' Most
importantly, according to the Claimant, the City could prevent the immediate enforceability of
the expropriation decision and atlow the maximum periods provided in the Road Legislation.
Further, the City could and should provide the Claimant with all information regarding the

current status of the expropriation proceedings.*

The Respondent's Position

In the Respondent's submission, there is no basis to claim that disagreement on a valuation of
the Lédz Premises constitutes a violation of Article 3 of the Treaty. According to the
Respondent, the documents on which the Claimant relies in this respect do not support its
contention. These “notes” are in fact the Claimant's own notes and do not constitute official
minutes of the meetings. Even so, their content does not fend credence to the Claimant's

alfegations: the documents do not serve as evidence that the Parties agreed to use three

valuation standards; but rather, there was no such gentlemen's agreement as described by the
364

Claimant.
While it is true that the Claimant did not receive a copy of the full expropriation request filed
by the City, the lack of such a copy has not prejudiced Enkev Polska in any way, so the
Respondent maintains, as those proceedings have not begun (as at June 2013). In particular,
Enkev Polska would be the entity to make a formal request in administrative proceedings for
such a document, as it would be the party in those proceedings. Even if the proceedings had
begun, Enkev Polska has not made any such request.

The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s complaint concerning lack of information is not
bore aut by the facts, as the City of Lodz has been in regular contact with the Claimant? The
Respondent refers to its explanations as to why it is not in a position to provide certain
information, but submits that any “failure” is, in any event, an inchoate act: “the Republic of
Poland has not yct had an opportunity to put to use its systematic safeguards against breaches of
international obligations.” Thus, an omission to provide information to the Claimant would
not constitute a breach under Article 3 of the Treaty.

Article 3(5) of the Treaty - Umbrella Clause
Aniicle 3(5) provides:

1 Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it may have entered into with
regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant interprets Article 3(5) of the Treaty as a supplement to the FET Standard. By

applying the general rules of interpretation derived from Article 31 of the Vienna Convention

on the Law of Treaties, the Claimant concludes that Article 3(5) of the Treaty “has a meaning

in itself’ and that “the clause was intended to impose substantial intemational obligations,

36?

separate and distinct from the other Treaty standards.”””’ It is the Claimant’s position that the

Tribunal should therefore take into account the Treaty, general international law and all other

agreements existing, between the Contracting Parties.

The Claimant identifies al least two specific obligations binding on the Respondent under
Article 3(5), According to the Claimant, a first assurance was given in 2010 when the City of
Lédz promised to inform the Claimant of “any administrative steps to be taken” (such as, for
instance, the Environmental] Impact Decision).’* In a letter to the Claimant dated 22 November
2010, the Head of the Bureau of Investment of the City of Lodz apologised for not having
notified the Claimant of this 2010 Decision on Environmental Conditions and promised to do

s0 with regard to “any plans to be introduced in the future.”°”°

A second assurance was made, in the Claimant's submission, by letter of 7 June 2011, in
response to an inquiry from the Claimant, by the City of Lédé stating “that there is no
knowledge on the potential pending administrative proceedings ENKEV POLSKA SA would
be a party to.”””' The Respondent's argument that a distinction should be drawn between a
statement of having knowledge of an ongoing proceeding and a statement that there was no
such proceeding ongoing, is, in the Claimant's submission, problematic for the Respondent
because the City of Ldédé did not make any disclaimer for distinguishing between actual
knowledge and the factual existence of any ongoing proceedings in this letter. In any event, the
Claimant’s inguiry was specifically directed to receive information on present or future
proceedings “with participation of the City or any other subjects.” Last, the Claimant notes that
the City of Lédz complied with the obligation when it informed Enkey Polska about the

enlargement of two other roads.?”

The Respondent's Position

Analysing the language of Article 3(5) of the Treaty, the Respondent contends that the
provision covers only contractual obligations between an investor and the host State with
respect to the investment. Unilatera] statements or assurances do not qualify as obligations

within this interpretation”?

According to the Respondent, the scope of the Umbrella Clause should be defined narrowly as
it would otherwise have “a too far reaching impact on the sovereignty of the host [S}tate, which
could not be presumed in the absence of a clear expression of the parties’ will to this effect.>*
That scope should be further limited since, according to the Respandent, investment tribunals
generally require significant interference with the rights of the investor to constitute a violation
of an umbrella clause obligation.”*

In any event, the Respondent submits that there can be no violation of the Umbrella Clause for
two reasons, First, the Respondent denies having entered into any obligations toward the
Claimant. Any statements alleged by the Claimant were made towards Enkev Polska and not
the Claimant.*” In any event, the Respondent submits that these statements cannot qualify as
“obligations” within the meaning of Article 3(5) of the Treaty. Those communications do not

even give rise to obligations by the City of Lodz under Polish law.”

In more general terms, the Respondent reiterates that it “has never given any assurances or
representations to the Claimant that it would receive a better treatment than to which it was

entitled under the Polish Road Legislation.”*”* It asserts:

{...] an investor may not simply assume that it is in general entitled to treatment more
preferential than that accorded to other individuals or entities and granted by the law in
force. Any commitment to grant such preferential treatment, besides from going beyond
the competences of the City, would clearly lead to discrimination in favour of Enkev and
as such could not be held as tegal.”””

All the statements alleged by the Claimant were, according to the Respondent, either made
“subject to the applicable procedures,” meaning that they could not go beyond Polish law,*—
or, made by persons not authorised to act on behalf of the City."

The Respondent emphasises that it noted its lack of knowledge of any pending administrative
proceedings against Enkev Polska, but did not indicate definitively that there were no such

proceedings. Contrary to the Claimant’s assertion, the Respondent maintains thal its

THE CLAIMANT’S RENEWED REQUEST FOR INTERIM MEASURES

The Claimant's Position

In the Claimant’s Renewed Request for Interim Measures, the Claimant asserts its “urgent
interest for some form of stability pending the resolution by the Arbitral Tribunal.”"* In the
alternative, the Claimant requests an order aimed at preserving the status quo pending the
issuance of a partial award on the interpretation and application of Article 5{c) of the Treaty

The Claimant submits that it faces a great deal of uncertainty regarding the timing and the
concrete effects of the construction works on the Lodi Premises, particularly in iight of the
Mayor's indication that she would re-submit a request for expropriation by the end of
September 2013 (as she eventually did). In the Claimant’s submission, numerous questions on
vital matters, such as the possibility of access to the buildings, their use, fire safety, security of
energy supplies and the overall effect of the road construction in the middle section of the Lédz
Premises remain unanswered. The Claimant contends that uncertainty makes its business in
Lédz i and practically 7 and it ilises Enkev Polska’s operation as

a going concern.**

The Claimant further contends that if Enkev Polska was to hand over the £6dZ Premises
immediately, it would face grave consequences such as the loss of employees and crucial

389

business prospects, as well as irreparable harm to its ‘ding to the Claimant,

the damage resulting from a takeover of its Premises increases with the less time Enkev Polska
is allowed to move to another location.*” Hence, according to the Claimant, a decision on
interim measures would be necessary to “offer the Tribunal and the Parties morc leeway to
operate with nuance rather than bulldozers.)

Next, the Claimant contends that the arguments on which the Respondent relied to dissuade the
Tribunal from issuing interim measures in the first instance, in particular, the Respondent’s

alleged concerns about the adverse effects of delaying the takeover of the Lédz Premises and

the risk of the EU funding application being rejected, “have all proved to be baseless.””” The
City’s late application for EU funding suggests that the acquisition of title to the Lodz Premises
was not a necessary precondition for the application 10 be successful, or even for il to be

submitted at all?”

292. Likewise, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has failed to show that the City would be

unable to meet the deadline of 31 December 2015 for completing the City centre modemisation
project if it could not obtain title to the Lédz Premises immediately. Rather, Polish media
reports suggest that compliance with the 2015 deadline was difficult for reasons unrelated to the

Lodz Premises."

The Respondent's Position

293. It is the Respondent's position that the Claimant’s Renewed Request for Interim Measures

should be rejected by the Tribunal since no action which the Respondent might take with regard
to the Lodz Premises in the future could constitute a “danger of current or imminent harm to
Enkevy Beheer—or more correctly its relevant investment: its shareholding [in Enkey
Polska].”" ven if this were the case, any such damage could be adequately remedied by
awarding pecuniary damages and would not outweigh the damage incurred by the Respondent
if the “EU funding be jeopardised.”

294. The Respondent further disputes that the factual pattem of the case changed since the Tribunal

issued its Order on Interim Measures on 8 March 2013. The Claimant’s Renewed Request
would not reveat new circumstances but rather “a series of misstatements.”*”” For one, the fact
that the Mayor of Lodz withdrew the 2013 Expropriation Request on 25 July 2013 does not
mean, according to the Respondent, that the Claimant's situation was altered. The change in the
City’s plans for the construction of the City centre does not impact the City’s plans regarding

the trajectory of the Nowotargowa Street, which will still serve as a main access road to the

398

to pursue expropriation proceedings against Enkev Polska.
Commenting on the Claimant's argument that the expropriation decision will be expedited, the
Respondent notes that the proceedings wil] be conducted in compliance with procedures under
Polish law and will not derogate from the scenario described in paragraph &4 of the Tribunal’s
Order on Interim Measures” In other words, there will be no imminent danger for Enkev
Polska to be evicted from its Lédz Premises without prior notification and an eppertunity to
challenge the potential expropriation decision.” The Respondent submits that, if the Polish
authorities really had the Iegal means to take over the Premises within a day (as the Claimant

suggests), the expropriation woold already have taken place.‘

296. The Respondent reiterates that the Tribunal rejected the Claimant's original request for interim

measures on the grounds that “the likely harm to the Claimant [was] adequately reparable by an
award of damages (paragraph 77 of the Order on Interim Measures, dated 8 March 2013] and
that nothing has changed since that time.*” Article 26(3} of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
requires the requesting party to show that the issuance of an interim measure is necessary; it

does not place the burden on the responding party to show to the contrary.‘

297. For the Respondent, it remains important that the timing for the EU funding does not change.

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS AND DECISIONS

The Claimant's Application: The Tribunal first addresses the Claimant’s procedural application
to add Enkev Polska as a second claimant to this arbitration. As already indicated above, this

application is opposed by the Respondent.

The Claimant necessarily acknowledges that Enkev Polska, its majority-owned Polish
subsidiary, is not at present a claimant in or a party to these arbitration proceedings and that the
only claimant party is the Claimant itself, as result of its own Request for Arbitration of
6 August 2012 which names the Claimant as the sole claimant party. The Claimant maintains
that its application was triggered, as a precautionary measure, by the Respondent’s “new”
argument in the Respondent's subsequent Counter-Memorial of 1S May 2013 to the effect that
the Claimant has no standing in this arbitration in regard to Enkev Polska. Accordingly, so it
submits, the Claimant makes a conditional application under Article 22 of the UNCITRAL

Arbitration Rules to add Enkev Polska as a co-claimant in these arbitration proceedings.

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant's application is made conditionally on the assumption that
the Tribunal should decide that the Claimant had a limited standing in regard to harm suffered
by its subsidiary, Enkev Polska. Jn the Tribunal’s view, such a conditional application cannot
properly be made under Article 22 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (or German law as the
Jex loci arbitri, if and to the extent relevant), being expressly dependent upon a future decision
in the Tribunal’s Award. If made, such an application must be made at least unconditionally

and in a timely manner, long before the Award.

Further, the Claimant's interpretation of Article 22 overlooks the procedurat rights of the
Respondent under Article 17 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: the Respondent would have
insufficient opportunity to present its case against Enkev Polska if Enkev Polska were only
joined as an additional party to this arbitration by this Award. It is no answer for the Claimant
to assert that the Respondent has or could have done so in presenting ils case in response to the
Claimant’s own case. The Claimant is not Enkev Polska; and their respective cases cannot be

assumed to be identical in all factual and legal respects.

Moreover, the Tribunal does not consider that Enkev Poiska could be joined as an additional
party under Article 22 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. That provision addresses only
amendments to a claim or defence by an existing party: il dues not address the addition (without
consent) of a third person not party to the arbitration. At this Jate stage of this arbitration, the
Tribunal does not consider that it has any power to add Enkev Polska as a co-claimant to these

arbitration proceedings.

86

305.

306.

307,

308.

309.

310.

In the Tribunal's view, even if it were a matter of discretion, there is no good reason why the
Claimant should not have sought to name Enkev Polska as a co-claimant from the outset of this
arbitration, given that the Respondent’s argument was reasonably foreseeable even before the

beginning of this arbitration.

Further, whenever made, any such application regarding Enkev Polska would have to satisfy
the requirements of Article 8, paragraphs (1) and (2) of the Treaty. The Tribunal does not here
address, still less decide, whether any application could or not be made by Enkev Polska under
Article § of the Treaty in this arbitration (or another arbitration), basing its decision here solely
upon Article 22 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

More importantly, given that the Tribunal decides below that the Claimant does have sufficient
standing in its own right in regard to relevant claims for indirect harm to itself suffered directly
by its subsidiary, Enkev Polska, it follows that the Claimant's application is, at least in part,

unnecessary.

Accordingly, the Tribunat decides ta dismiss the Claimant's conditional application to add
Enkev Polska as a co-claimant. It follows that the Claimant remains, as from the outset of this

arbitration, the only claimant party in this arbitration against the Respondent.

Article 1 af the Treaty: The Tribunal next addresses the status of the Claimant as an “investor”
with an “investment” under the Treaty. The Trihunal accepts that the Claimant qualifies on the
facts of this case as an “investor” within the meaning of Articte 1(b)(ii) of the Treaty; i-e., the
Claimant is a legal person constituted under the law of the Netherlands as a Contracting Party
to the Treaty.

The Tribunal also accepts on the facts of this case that the Claimant's shareholding in Enkev
Polska from 2001 onwards is an “investment” under Article [(aX{ii) of the Treaty, being shares
and “rights derived from shares” held by the Claimant in Enkev Polska. The Tribunal does not
accept that the Claimant’s “investment” extends beyond such rights, whether under Article | of
the Treary or under Polish faw. In other words, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant's submission
that, as a claimant, it can stand in the shoes of its subsidiary, Enkev Polska, as regards the
property (i
monies {including profits): the Claimant's rights derive only from its majority shareholding in

laiter’s movable and i | property), assets and
Enkev Polska; and whilst its rights extend beyond its shareholding (being also “rights derived
from” its shareholding), the Claimant has no standing to make a claim on its subsidiary’s behalf

for harm suffered directly by its subsidiary.

311.

313.

314,

‘The Tribunal notes that a claimant’s investment as a shareholder was broadly interpreted by the
tribunal in Eureko v. Poland.’ Under the Netherlands-Poland BIT (ie., the Treaty), the

claimant’s investment was held to comprise not only its minority shareholding in a Polish

  

company, but also corparate governance rights and rights under an initial public offering. In the
Tribunal’s view, these other “investments” were all rights “derived from shares" held by that
claimant and were not independent investments unrelated to those shares and associated rights.
This decision does not therefore support the Claimant's submission that it can effectively stand

in the same shoes as Enkev Polska.

The Tribunal also rejects the Claimant's submission that retention of Enkev Polska’s profits
constitutes a further investment by the Claimant; and it also rejects the Claimant's further
submissions that Enkev Polska’s goodwill and know-how, as well as the Claimant’s own
management of Enkev Polska can constitute separate investments by the Claimant under Article
1 of the Treaty. 11 may well be that these elements could indirectly affect the value of the
Claimant’s shares and the Claimant’s rights derived from those shares; but, in the Tribunai’s
view, the Respondent is correct, both under the Treaty and Polish law, in submitting that none
can constitute separate investments by the Claimant, given (in particular) that the Claimant is a

different juridical person from Enkev Polska.

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant is a covered investor with a covered
investment under the Treaty. It cannot claim directly for any harm suffered directly by Enkev
Poiska; but it can claim in its own night under che Treaty for harm suffered by itself, ¢.g., fom
the diminution or total loss of rights derived from its shares in Enkev Polska, In the Tribunal’s
view, subject to issues regarding quantum (inctuding double recovery} which are not addressed
in this Award, it follows that the Claimant has sufficient standing to advance, in its own right,

the relevant substantive claims made by the Claimant in this arbitration.

Article 8 of the Treaty: As regards Article 8 of the Treaty, the Respondent submits that the
Claimant resorted to arbitration prematurely on the grounds that the Claimant: (i) failed to
comply with Article 8(1) to provide sufficient notice of its claims to the Respondent and to seek
any amicable settlement before resorting to urbitration; and (ii) failed to comply with Article

8(2) requiring a six-month waiting period before commencing this arbitration.

315.

316.

318.

319.

The Claimant denies that its claims cannot be considered by this Tribunal on the merits, i-e.,
with no bar under Article 8 regarding jurisdiction or admissibility. As regards the waiting
period under Article 8(2) of the Treaty, the Claimant also invokes the more favourable three-
month waiting period contained in Article 8(1) of the UK-Poland BIT, Article 8(2) of the
Finland-Poland BIT and Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty, applied to this arbitration (so
it submits) by virtue of Articles 3(2) and 3(6) of the Treaty, its Most Favoured Nation Clause.
in the Tribunal’s view, this lesser period of three months does not materially assist the Claimant
on the facts of this case, Accordingly. the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to decide whether

of not a period less than six months applies to the Claimant's claim in this arbitration.

(n the Tribunal’s view, the relevant chronological facts are simply these: the Claimant
commenced this arbitration on 6 August 2012; prior to that date, the Claimant had not
articulated to the Respondent its own particular claims under the Treaty, still less sought any
amicable settlement between the Claimant and the Respondent for those particular claims; and
yet, before 6 March 2012, there were several interventions with the City of Lddz made by and
on behalf of the Claimant’s subsidiary, Enkev Polska.

In these circumstances, as a matter of form, the Claimant began these proceedings prematurely
against the Respondent. In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimant (not being synonymous with
Enkev Polska) should have formalised its own particular claims by adequate notice to the
Respondent (not being synonymous with the City of L6dz), indicating specifically how the
Claimant's shareholding was or was to be affected by the actual or threatened measures by the
City of which the Claimant here complains; the Claimant should then have engaged with the
Respondent in an attempt amicably to settle those particular claims under the Treaty; and
accordingly the Claimant should have waited at least three, if not six, months after such an

attempt before resorting to these arbitration proceedings.

For several reasons, the Tribunal does not consider that these collective failures require this
Tribunal to declare that it has no jurisdiction to address the merits of the Claimant's claims in
this arbitration. It is clear on the facts of this case that the Clatmant’s subsidiary, Enkev Polska,
was in active discussions with the City of Lodé over the likely effects of any measures upon its
own business in Lédz, from November 2010 onwards. It is clear that if those effects had also
included any effects upon the Claimant's own shareholding in Enkev Polska, it would have

made no material difference to those discussions or the events which subsequently ensued.

Further, both Enkev Polska and the City of Lodé acted in good faith, albeit unsuccessfully and
with increasing difficulty, to find an amicable solution to what was fast becoming an

irreconcilable dispute between Enkev Polska and the City of 46d, before March 2012. It is

89

clear that, even if the Claimant had formally become a party to such attempts at an amicable
settlement (in regard ta its own particular claims) under the Treaty, that also would have made

no material difference to the events which subsequently ensued.

320. Finally, this is not a case where the Claimant has ever deliberately shied away from pressing its
case whenever, wherever or to whomsoever it could in Poland. If the Respondent had even
opened the door half ajar to any amicable discussions regarding the Claimant's own particular
claim (as distinct from Enkev Polska), the Claimant would have seized that opportunity without
any hesitation. Hence, in the Tribunal’s view, this is manifestly not a case where a claimant has

consciously defied its obligation to engage in amicable discussions with the host State.

321. With these cumulative explanatory factors, the Tribunal considers that it would not be right to
construe the terms of Article 8 of the Treaty as barring absolutely the Claimant's claims in this
arbitration as a matter of jurisdiction; nor, for the same reason and on the facts of this case, to
consider such claims inadmissible as regards the exercise of jurisdiction by this Tribunal.
Having regard to the object and purpose of Article 8 under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention
on the Law of Treaties, given also the context of the Treaty intended (by its preamble)
expressly to encourage and protect foreign investments in Poland, the Tribunal decides that the
over-strict meaning, for which the Respondent contends, is too semantic in its approach and
unduly harsh in its result. This is particularly so where the Claimant’s non-compliance is only
formalistic and where the Respondent has suffered no prejudice which could not be
compensaied by an appropriate order by this Tribunal for ‘egal and arbitration casts
unnecessarily incurred or wasted by reason of the Claimant’s undue haste in commencing this

arbitration.

322. The Tribunal nates that other arbitration tribunals have taken a similar approach, in the absence
of clear wording in the particular BIT requiring a different decision as to jurisdiction or
adsnissihility. The Tribunal has considered these and other legal materials in order to confirm
ils own approach io Article 8. It need here only refer to the Decision on Jurisdiction in
Ambiente v. Argentina." That tribunal decided thet Articles 8(1)-8(3) of the Italy-Argentina
BIT, as regards the pre-requisite for amicable consultation, imposed requirements of
admissibility rather than jurisdiction: see paragraphs 577 to 588 of the Decision. The tribunal

therefore disntissed the 's objections as to bath j and issibility in a

case where the claimant had deliberately eschewed any form of amicable consultation with the

“° Ambiente v. Argentina, Award of 8 February 2013 (Bruno Simma, Karl-Heinz Boeckstiegel and, dissenting,
Dr, Santiago Torres Bermardez).

respondent, facts significantly more extrerne than the facts of the present case. The Tribunal
could cite further legal materials in support of this general approach; but it seems unnecessary

to do so here.

Accordingly, subject to any order for costs under Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules {as to
which the Tribunal reserves its full jurisdiction, powers and discretion), the Tribunal decides
both that it has jurisdiction and that it can exercise such jurisdiction over the merits of the

Claimant’s claims in this arbitration made under Articles 3 and 5 the Treaty.

General Approach: It is however necessary at the outset to record two significant factors in the
general approach taken by the Tribunai in this case towards the merits of these claims, as

regards respectively procedure and substance.

First, this Tribunal is an arbitration tribunal mandated to address and decide by one or more
awards a particular dispute in existence between two named parties. The Tribunal’s mandate
derives ftom the Parties’ consent to be found in the Treaty, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
and (to the extent relevant) German law as the /ex foci arbitri. \t is no part of that mandate,
however broadly interpreted, to deliver any advisory opinion to the Parties: this Tribunal is not
permitted to act in the role of a legal adviser to the Parties; nor is it authorised as an amiable
compositeur or to act ex aequo et bono by the Parties under Article 35(2} of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules; nor is it a Court empowered specifically to issue advisory opinions to
interested persons, such as the International Court of Justice or the European Court of Justice. It
is, indeed, no court at all, but only a tribunal with its powers limited by the boundaries of the
Parties’ own consent to arbitration, The Tribunal does not accept the Claimant's submission
that Article 11 of the Treaty permits this Tribunal to act otherwise: this Tribunal can derive no
authority from Article 12 to interpret the Treaty, that role being confined expressly to the
Treaty’s Contracting Parties.

Asa matter of procedure, the Tribunal therefore accepts generally the submission made by the
Respondent that this Tribunal has no power to advise the Parties as to any Future or non-existent
dispute, however imminent or grave that potential dispute might be. The Tribunal recognises
the difficult commercial position in which the Claimant is placed by this approach; the
Claimant’s submission to the contrary was made in good faith and doubtless reflected the
pressing need for legal certainty and predictability as regards future events shared both by the
Claimant and its subsidiary, Enkev Polska. Nonetheless, however tempting that submission
might be on commercial grounds for the Claimant, ihe Tribunal’s general approach is

necessarily rooted in the wording of Article 8 of the Treaty, limiting the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

91

328.

329.

330.

to a dispute relating to the effects of a measure taken by the Respondent, i.e., a measure taken

in the past and not a future measure as yet untaken,

Second, this Tribunal is not an appellate court inserted into the Polish legal system. Nor is it
entrusted by the Parties with the general task of judicially reviewing the legality or
reasonableness of administrative acts by Polish state entities under Polish law. As already
explained, this Tribunal’s mandate derives from the Treaty and international law. In particular,
it cannot act as the ultimate town planner for the City of L4dzZ. It is certain that this Tribunal is
no more fitted to decide issues of town planning in the City of Lédz than its town planners are
fitted to apply and interpret the Treaty as an international arbitration tribunal: each has different

roles.

This Tribunal therefore accepts generaily the submission made by the Respondent that it is not
the Tribunal’s task, in addressing the substance of the Claimant’s claims, “to act as an
administrative review body to conduct oversight over the said proceedings” [i.e., the
administrative and judicial expropriation proceedings to which Enkev Polska’s premises are
subjected in Poland}: see paragraphs 6, 17 and 27 of the Respondent’s Submission of
28 February 2014.

Article 5: Article 5 of the Treaty provides that the Respondent shall not “take any measures
depriving, directly or indirectly.” the Claimant of its investment unless three stated conditions
are met by the Respondent. In summary, these conditions relate to: (a) public interest and due
process of law; (b) non-discrimination and compliance with any undertaking which the
Respondent may have given to the Claimant; and (c) the provision for the payment of “just
compensation.” Such compensation “shal! represent the real value of the investment affected
and shall, in order to be effective for [the Claimant], be paid and made transferable, without
undue delay, to [e.g.. the Netherlands as the country likely to be designated by the Claimant] in

any freely convertible currency accepted by the Claimant.”

The wording of Article 5 does not use the word “expropriation,” but rather the broader legal
concept of “depriving.”*”' In the Tribunal’s view, these different terms bear somewhat different
legal meanings; but these differences are not material to this case. It is however clear that
deprivation can take many different forms, not limited to nationalisation, formal transfer of title
or outright physical seizure. It is also clear that the general meaning of lawful deprivation

implies conditions as to the taking of the investment for a public purpase provided by law in a

“| Here, as elsewhere, the Tribunal refers to “expropriation” by reference to Polish law and to “deprivation” by
reference to Article $ of the Treaty.

333.

334.

non-discriminatory manner and with adequate compensation, as reflected in the wording of
Article 5. The Tribunal notes that Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the 1952 European Convention of
Human Rights, being part of EU law and thus also Polish law, contains a materially similar

provision.

Direct Deprivation: \n the Tribunal’s view, on the facts of this case, it is not possible for the
Claimant to contend that any measure taken by the Respondent (including the City of Lodz) has
deprived “directly” the Claimant of its rights as a shareholder in Enkev Polska. Those rights
under both intemational law and Polish law are materially identical today as when the Claimant
first acquired those shares between 2001 and 2009. The Claimant remains a shareholder in
Enkev Polska; it can still exercise its shareholder rights within Enkev Polska, as before; and
none of the measures alleged by the Claimant affects directly any of the Claimant's shares or
any of the rights associated with those shares. The Claimant does not allege (nor could it) that
the Respondent or the City of Lédz has ever intended or expressed any intention to expropriate
the Claimant of its shares in Enkev Polska. The Tribunal concludes, as of the date of this
Award, that there is therefore no case for the Respondent to answer as regards any “direct”

deprivation of the Claimant's investment under Arlicte 5 of the Treaty.

Indirect Deprivation: Accordingly, the relevant question here is whether the Claimant has been
“indirectly” deprived of its righis in Enkev Polske’s shares. As regards Article 5, the Claimant
submits that the relevant test is whether there exists such unreasonable interference with the
use, enjoyment or disposal of property as to justify an inference that the property owner will not
be able to use, enjoy or dispase of its property within a reasonable period of time after the
inception of such interference. The Claimant submits that, whatever the position might have
been before the “new developments,” the position with such developments is now clear with
the formal notification of 7 January 2014 of the “Decision” of 30 December 2013 to commence
decision-making on a motion for an immediately enforceable expropriation decision by the City
of Lédz, namely Exhibit C-1590 (the “Notification”).

Given that these “new developments” from December 2013 onwards are now presented as the
high point of the Claimant's case, the Tribunal concentrates on these events for the purpose of
its decisions below, albeit that it has kept much in mind the factual context in which the

Claimant has earlier presented its case.

With the Notification of 7 January 2014, the Claimant submits that the expropriation by the
Respondent of ai least a material part of Enkev Polska’s real property (as a usufruct) is not
hypothetical but now, more than ever, both near-inevitable and imminent. The Claimant has not

infrequently resorted to invoking the idea of a bulldozer arriving at Enkev Polska's factory

93

335.

336.

337.

338.

gates within a short time-period, without any prior notice to Enkev Polska and with catastrophic
consequences for Enkev Polska’s business. It is not necessary for the Tribunal to go as far as
that.

The Tribunal finds, on the factual evidence in this case, that it is now highly probable that at
least a material part of Enkev Polska’s real property will be expropriated by the City of Lédé at
a future date. That may not be weeks or months away (because there remain several
administrative and legal steps to be completed}, but such an act of expropriation is mast
unlikely to be years away. In planning terminology, Enkev Polska's business premises are
affected by “planning blight”; and, in order to survive as a successful business with a
significant plant and many employees, Enkev Polska is required to prepare in advance of
expropriation by moving its business to new premises elsewhere, as soon as reasonably
practicable. Such a decision was made by Enkey Polsku in September 2013, as evidenced by
the Claimant's email message dated 27 September 2013 to the Respondent and the Tribunal;

und that decision’s implementation has recently been accelerated,

‘The current predicament facing Enkev Polska is well described in the Claimant’s Submission of
17 February 2014 to the Tribunal, in regard to the Notification’s immediate legal effect under
Polish jaw, namely Article 11d, section 9 and 10 of the Road Legislation [Exhibit C-19}.
According to the Claimant, as a matter af Polish law, Enkev Polska can no longer transfer any
of its rights pertaining to its real property to any third person, including its use, as security in
order to obtain funding to find alternative business premises. Again, according to the Claimant,
the legal effect of the Notification encompasses the entirety of Enkev Polska’s real property and
not only that part which is likely to be the subject of expropriation by the City of Lédz; i-e.,
only 6,760 m? of a total area of 22,306 in? (30 percent).

As a practical matter, Enkev Polska’s inability to usc its existing premises as security is,
according to the Claimant, gravely impeding Enkev Polska’s attempts to fund its alternative
location under its contract of 27 January 2014 with the vendor of its new premises. The
Claimant submits that Enkey Polska can neither provide such security in the form of its existing
real property (given the effect of the Notification); nor can Enkey Polska (in practice, for the
same reason) give any security right over any future compensation payable by the City of Lédz
to Enkey Polska for the expropriation of its property (see paragraphs 2.1t to 2.14 of the

Claimant's Submission).

The Tribunal notes that this legal description of Enkev Polska’s predicament is not materially
challenged by the Respondent. During the procedural meeting held on 7 February 2014,

Dr, Wisnicwski for the Respondent confirmed: “that the legal effect of the commencement of

94

339,

340.

341.

the proceedings [i.e., the Notification], which is an ex fege effect, so it is nat the result of any
decision but the pure result of the commencement of the proceedings [,..] ane of the provisions
of the Road Legislation referring to the property which is owned by the State Treasury of
Communities [...]” which the Respondent also confirmed as being Article 11d, section 9 and
10, of the Road Legislation of 2003 [Transcript, pp. 19-20]. The Respondent explained these
effects further in its Submission of 28 February 2014: “[...] Such effects, preventing the owner
— or, in case of Enkev Polska, the perpetual usufructary — of the land from transferring or
encumbering the right to land, only occur upon notification of the announcement to the affected

party”: p ph 41 of the Resp: "Ss ission, see also 49 and 54.

 

Despite these legal effects since 7 January 2014, it remains a fact that no actual decision has yet
been taken by the Respondent to expropriate any part of Enkev Polska’s premises under the
Road Legislation, still less any actual expropriation of any part of Enkev Polska’s premises.
Moreover, as decided above, the Claimant's investment is limited to its shares in Enkev Polska
(with associated rights) and does not extend to Enkev Polska’s own property. The Ciaimant’s
shares in Enkevy Polska have not been expropriated and, on the evidence available to the

Tribunal, these shares will not be expropriated under the Road Legislation.

In the Tribunal's view, however, there can be little doubt that, as of now, the commercial value
of the Claimants’ rights in its shareholding in Enkev Polska has been adversely affected, albeit
nat destroyed, by the predicament facing Enkev Polska. The question therefore arises whether
such diminution in value amounts in this case to an indirect deprivation of the Ciaimant’s

investment within the meaning of Article 5 of the Treaty.

As regards such indirect deprivation, the Tribunal considers that Article 5 of the Treaty requires
the Claimant to establish that the practical effect upon its investment of Enkev Polska’s
predicament, as regards severity and duration, is materially the same as if its investment in
Enkev Polska had been directly deprived by the Respondent. In other words, the Claimant must
prove, on the facts of this case, that its investment in the form of shares in Enkev Polska and

rights deriving from such shares has lost ali or almost ai! significant commercial value.

95

342.

344,

As described by Professors Paulsson and Douglas in regards to the test under international law,
equally applicable to Article 5 of the Treaty, “... the analysis should focus on the nature or
magnitude of the interference ta the investor’s property interests in its investment caused by the
measures attributable to the Host State fo determine whether those acts amount to a taking.”
. the

decisive criterion when i comes to deciding whether an indirect expropriation or a measure

 

Similarly, Professor Schreuer assessed a challenged measure’s severity as follows:

tantamount to expropriation has taken place [is supported by] a broad consensus in academic
writings that the intensity and duration of the economic deprivation is the crucial factor in
identifying an indirect expropriation or equivalent measure."“"* Professor Dolzer commented to
similar effect: “No one will seriously doubt that the severity of the impact upon the legal status,
and the practical impact on the owner's ability to use and enjoy his property, will be a central
factor in determining whether a regulatory measure effects a taking.”“"*

The Respondent argued for such an interpretation of Article 5, citing a significant number of
other tegal materials constituting a “jurisprudence constante,” inchuding the awards in Staretr
(1983), Tipperts (1984), Pope & Talbot (2000), S.D. Myers (2000), and CME (2001) In
Starrett, the tribunal stated the test under international law as requiring an interference with
property rights “to such an extent that these rights are rendered so useless that they must be
deemed to have been expropriated, even though the state does not purport to have expropriated
them and the legal title to the property formally remains with the legal awner” (paragraph 154).
In Tippetts, the tribunal also emphasised the need under international law for the deprivation of

the investor’s “fundamental rights of ownership” (paragraph 225).

Iv is unnecessary for the Tribunal here to add to these cilations or other legal materials, In short,
the Tribunal i that the | mass of ii i legal ials, comprising
both arbitral decisions and doctrinal writings, describe for indirect expropriation, taking or
deprivation, consistently albeit in different terms, the requirement under international law for
the investor to establish the substantial, radical, severe, devastating or fundamental deprivation

of its rights or their virtual annihilation and effective neutralisation.

On the facts of this case, having regard to the magnitude and intensity of the effects upon the
Claimant's investment from Enkey Polska’s predicament (even with the “new developments”
to date), the Tribunal finds that the rights attaching to the Claimant’s shares in Enkev Polska
have not been rendered “so useless”; nor has the Claimant suffered any loss to its “fundamental
rights of ownership” regarding its shareholding in Enkev Palska; nor has the Claimant beer
deprived of such rights or their exercise as to amount in effect to their neutralisation or
annihilation. (The Tribunal does not base its decision on the relatively short duration, so far, of

these effects.)

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant’s claim fails under Article 5 of the Treaty
and must be dismissed: there is no measure taken by the Respondent indirectly depriving the
Claimant of its investment. This decision suffices to dispose of the Claimant's claim under
Article 5 of the Treaty. Nonetheless, as a matter of courtesy to the Parties and their Counsel,
given the elaborate and not inconsiderable efforts made by them all in these arbitration
proceedings, the Tribunal addresses briefly below the other issues arising under Article 5 of the
Treaty in respect of the Claimant’s claim, before addressing the Claimant’s claims under
Article 3 of the Treaty.

These other requirements of Article 5 of the Treaty relate, as concems this case: i} public
interest; (it} due process of law: (iii) any undertaking by the Respondent to the Claimant; and

(iv} just compensation. It is appropriate to take each of these in tum.

Public Interest: From the evidence adduced in these arbitration proceedings, the Tribunal finds
that all measures by the City of Lédé (as alleged by the Claimant) have been and are being
taken in the public interest, within the meaning of Article 5(a) of the Trealy. The factual story
over the years is long and complicated; and the Tribunal can do no better here than state its
acceptance of the statement made in the motion dated 30 September 2013 by the City of Ladd
for an immediately enforceable expropriation under the Road Legislation [Exhibit C-151, as

here translated into English by the Claimant]:

The investment project that is the subject of this request is a part of the task that involves
upgrading of the Warsaw - Lodz railway line stage If, Lot B 2- segment Léd¢ Widzew
Lodz Fabryczna including the £4d% Fabryczna station and the construction of the
underground part of the Ladz Fabryczna train station to be used for dispatching and
receiving trains and to serve passengers. The reconstruction of the road system and the
infrastructure around the multimodal Lédz Pabryczna train station - the construction of the
integrated transfer node (hub) above and under the planned Nowotorgowa street. In
conjunction with the implementation of the task the main train station of the City of Lédz -
the Fabryczny train station, was shut down, The main passenger streams are currently
served by the Lodz Widzew train station. This situation is very disadvantageous for the
operations of the railway transportation, as well as for the passengers. It has a significant
impact upon additional transportation difficulties on the main axis of the city: East - West.

97

349,

It is in the public interest to reduce the implementation time of this investment project as
much as possible in order to restore the original location of the city’s main train station.

The roads planned to be constructed that are within the scope of this request are a very
important element of the task under way. These streets constitute elements of the main
transportation services’ system thet encompasses the train station, the bus slation, the city
transportation system's bus stops and the parking area, The completion (duration) of the
construction of these streets is the essential factor that determines the date of completing
{putting into operation) the entire task.

The investment project is carried out in the very downtown area of the city. The
acceleration of the investment project’s implementation will reduce the difficulties for the
city’s inhabitants and will decrease the social costs of the investment project under way.

Taking into account the above elements the requesting party [i.¢., the City of L4dz] is of
the opinion that in accordance with art. 17 clause 1 of the law of April 10, 2003 on special
rules for preparing and implementing investment projects related to public roads (Journal
of Laws of 2003 no. 80, item 721 as subsequently amended) the Road Legisfation] it
is justified to request granting of the immediate enforcement clause due to the justified
economic and public interest.

 

{The Notification of 7 January 2014 refers to this motion of 30 September 2013; and the latter
can therefore be taken as the continued position of the City of Lodz for the purposes of this
Award).

The Claimant complains that the urban planning proposals made by and on behalf of the City of
L46dz have significantly changed over the years. (For ease of explanation, the Tribunal appends
overleaf a map submitted by the Claimant). Even if this were materially correct as regards the
Premises (which the Tribunal assumes in the Claimant’s favour for the sake of its argument),
such changes do not support the Claimant's case. To the contrary, it is notorious that urban
planners constantly adjust their proposals as any major and complex project moves forward,
being subject to (inter alia) the vicissitudes of changing priorities, the demands of financing,
budgetary limitations and both public and appropriate political influences. In the Tribunal’s
view, the changes identified by the Claimant support the Respondent’s case: it could have been
suspicious if the planning proposals of the City of Lodz had constantly targeted Enkev Polska’s
Premise in exactly the same way from beginning to end, despite major changes in the City's
urban plans over many years. That is not this case. In the Tribunal’s view, there is no evidence
of any improper targeting, malice or bad faith on the part of the City of Lédz, still less by the
Respondent.

Due Process of Law: Towards the beginning of this arbitration, the Respondent helpfully
supplied a “road-map” of the different and successive administrative, legal and judicial steps
which could lead to the eventual expropriation of Enkev Polska’s real property. (It was used at
the Hearing on Interim Measures in Berlin on 13 February 2013 and is repeated in the
Respondent's Suomission of 28 February 2014.) The Tribunal accepts this road-map as a useful
and accurate summary of the legal situation facing Enkev Polska under Polish law. (For ease of

reference, a copy of this road-map is appended overleaf).

The coad-map consists of seven steps, of which the Notification of 7 January 2014 forms only
the first step. The second step has not yet been reached, stil! less any further administrative,
legal or judicial step culminating in the actual expropriation of Enkev Polska’s real property
under the Road Legislation, In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not
established any want of due process under Polish or international law: that process has far to go
in Poland, including the possibility for several judicial interventions by the Polish courts. In the
Tribunai’s view, the Claimant’s complaint is premature. Moreover, there is no reason to assume
that the Polish legal system, including the procedures and practices of Polish administrative
bodies and Polish courts, would violate in the future the Respondent's obligations under Article
5(a) of the Treaty.

Any Undertaking: The Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to establish any relevant
undertaking by the Respondent within the meaning of Article 5(b) of the Treaty. To the
contrary, from the outset of its investment in 2000, the Claimant knew or should reasonably
have known that Enkev Polska's industrial premises, located in the centre of L6dz, were subject
to expropriation for urban renewal under Polish law, as any like premises could be in the cities
of other European countries, including the Netherlands. Such lawful expropriation for urban
planning (with compensation) is a business risk to be accepted by a foreign investor in Poland,
just as it must be for a domestic Polish investor. Jt would have been extraordinary and contrary
to Polish law for the City of L6dé to undertake to the Claimant thai Enkev Polska would be
immune from the rules and procedures imposed by Polish legislation, including the Road
Legislation. The Tribunal does not accept the Claimant's interpretation of the email message of
25 November 2009 sent by ~ of the Camerimage Centre and the City of
LédZ to" of the Claimant. It contained no undertaking inconsistent with the
Road Legislation; and the Tribunal finds that no other undertaking took place which could
support the Claimnant’s case. Nor is there any evidence of any discrimination within the
meaning of Artiele 5(b) of the Treaty.

353, Just Compensation: Unlawful deprivation is not generally to be regarded as an ordinary
risk of foreign investment because it assumes a breach by the host State of its
obligations under international law. Conversely, lawful deprivation is generally to be
regarded by a foreign investor as a risk ordinarily to be run in the host State. As regards
the measure of compensation for lawful deprivation, a State should not be unjustly
enriched by taking an investment, whether by direct or indirect deprivation, without

paying appropriate compensation for that investment,

344. Accordingly, lawful deprivation, under international law, assumes the payment by the host
State io the foreign investor of adequate, effective and prompt compensation, to use the
phrasing of the Hull formula.*"* In effect, when a foreign investor makes its investment in the
host State, by necessary implication, that State represents to that investor that there will be no
deprivation without such compensation in accordance with the host State’s international

obligations.

355. The Tribunal sees no different result, in principle, from the phrase “just compensation” in
Article 5(c) of the Treaty, read with its subsequent explanation; namely: “such compensation
shall represent the real value of the investments affected and shall, in order to be effective for
the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without undue delay, to the country designated by

the claimants concemed in any freely convertible curreney accepted by the claimants.”

356. No foreign investor should have any reason 10 suppose that a host State under the Treaty would
deprive a foreign investor of its investment without adequate, effective and prompt, i.e., “just
compensation” in accordance with its obligations assumed in the Treaty under international
taw. The Tribunal has considered whether the word “just” bears any other meaning, including
its equivalent wording in the Dutch and Polish texts of Article 5, to be interpreted in accordance
with the customary rules of interpretation codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna

Convention of the Law of Treaties.

At the Tribunal’s request, the Respondent submitted the official texts of the Polish, Dutch and
English versions of Article S(c) of the Treaty. The Respondent emphasised that the English
language version would prevail in case of any differences of interpretation; but it noted at the
same time that ail three language versions concur with each other, underlining the phrase (in

each version) “representing the real value of the investment."

The English Version

Se: the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of just compensation. Such
compensation shail represent the real value of the investments affected and shall, in order to be
effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without undue delay, to the country
designated by the claimants concerned in any freely convertible currency accepted by the
claimants.

In response, the Claimant commented on the Dutch language version of Article 5(c) of the BIT
by stating (i) that the term “billijk” corresponds to the English word “just meaning “redelijk en
rechtvaardig,” (ii) that the term “werkelijke waarde” corresponds to the English word “real,”
and (iii) that “werkelijk" is a term that has two meanings—first, “wezenlijk bestaand” (i.c.,
genuinely in existence} and, second, “feitalijke verricht, verkregen, verdiend” which has a
connotation expressing functionality and usefulness.*'*

In simple terms, the dispute between the Parties over the interpretation of Article 5(c) turns on

for a valuation based on the fair market value of the investment.”

360. Fair market value usually means the sales value of an investment at a particular date,

immediately before the time at which the expropriation occurred or the decision to expropriate
the asset became publicly known. The World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign
Direct Investment (Section 6 of Guideline IV) defines fair market value as “an amount that a
willing buyer would normally pay io a willing seller after taking into account the nature of the
investment, the circumstances in which it would operate in the future and its specific
characteristics, including the period in which it has been in existence, the proportion of tangible
assets in the total investment and other relevant factors pertinent to the specific circumstances

of each case.""?!

361, Replacement (or relocation value) may mean a greater amount because an operating investment

cannot usually be replaced by simply acquiring the same tangible assets as the expropriated
investment.” Such additional factors may include, but are not limited ta, the costs of
relocation, the technological standard of the different assets, contractual rights, employee costs
and customer relationships. The Claimant claims here the costs for the relocation of its
investinent and the refurbishment of a new building, as well as a sufficient period of transition

to avoid the discontinuation of production“

2. The Tribunal has considered whether guidance on this disputed issue of interpretation may be

derived from published judgments and awards applying similar wording under international

law, together with scholarly texts.

payment.’“?* However, in this case, Poland had taken the factory at Chorzéw in violation of
intemational law; and thus the judicial statements apply to unlawful expropriation and

ip ion as a form of itution under it i law. Comp ion for unlawful
expropriation may entail more than compensation for lawful expropriation. Therefore, it is
questionable whether the approach in Factory at Chorzdw is directly relevant to the present
issue of interpretation under the Treaty. For the same reason, the Tribunal has derived no
decisive assistance from Article 31 of the Intemational Law Commission's Articles on State

Responsibility and its Commentary.

364. Norwegian Shipowners' Claim (Norway v. USA) (PCA):"* In this case the tribunal concluded
that compensation was due regardless of whether the expropriatory measures taken by the USA
against Norwegian shipowners were lawful or not. In order to determine the compensation
standard to be applied, the tribunal relied on international law and U.S. law which entitled the
expropriated shipowners to “just compensation.” The Tribunal stated that: “[,.,] il is common
ground that such compensation is measured not only by: (a) the fair actual value of the property
taken, but also (b) at the time and place it was taken, and (c) in view of all the surrounding

circumstances.”

The tribunal also noted that the circumstances of the possible compensation
should be based upon a fair market value of the property and that: “[jJust compensation implies
a complete restitution of the status quo ante. based, not upon future gains of the United States
or other powers, but upon the loss of profits of the Norwegian owners as compared with other
owners of similar property.““* It was common ground between the Parties that just
compensation “should be based upon the net value of the property taken.”*?” Due to the unusual
circumstances in this case—expropriation for war-like purposes—the tribunal found it
somewhat difficult to fix the “rea! market value of some of these shipbuilding contracts,“"° and
it therefore assessed such value ex aequo et bono. Apart from these contracts, the tribunal took

into consideration all the circumstances pertaining to the net value of the property.”*!

provides that a lawful expropriation must be accompanied by the payment of just compensation
representing the “genuine value of the investments affected.” The tribunal (by a majority)
interpreted this requirement as mirroring the Hull formula providing for the payment of prompt,
adequate and effective compensation for the taking of foreign property. The tribunal took the
view that the standard in investment treaties is the payment of “just compensation,”
representing the “genuine” or “fair market” value of the property taken.**? [t concluded that:
“{sJome treaties provide for prompt, adequate and effective compensation amounting to the
market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the
intention to embark thereon become public knowledge. Others provide that compensation shall
represent the equivalent of the investment affected. These concordant provisions are variations
on an agreed, essential theme, namely, that when a State takes foreign property, full

compensation must be paid.’*™

The tribunal noted further that its interpretation was supported
by the provisions of the Dutch-Czech BIT itself which provides “most favoured nation”
treatment to foreign investors. As the (more favourable) Czech-U.S. BIT provided expressly
that compensation shalt represent the fair market value of an investment, the tribunal decided
that this standard could be applied also to Dutch investors by virtue of Article 3(5) of the

Dutch-Czech BIT.“

Rumeli y, Kazakhstan (ICSID):"* The tribunal, applying the Kazakhstan-Turkey BIT and the
Kazakh Foreign Investment Law (“FIL”), equated the term “real value” with the “fair market
value.” Article JH] of the Kazakh-Turkish BIT provides that compensation “shalf be equivalent
to the real value of the expropriated investment before the expropriatory action was taken or
became known”; and Article 7(2) of the FIL provides that “compensation must be equal to the
fair market value of the expropriated investments at the moment when the investor learnt of the
expsopriation.”“*” The tribunal concluded that no relevant distinction could be drawn between
the two expressions “real value” and “fair market value.” Interpreting both provisions, the
tribunal applied the method of valuation which would most closely reflect the value of the
expropriated investment to the investor, Accordingly, the correct approach would be to award

such compensation as would give back fo the claimants the value of their shares at the time

when the expropriation took place.”

Regarding the concrete method of valuation, the tribunal
relied on the fair market value as defined in the World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of
Foreign Direct Investment as a starting point but reminded itself that the Guidelines do not
imply the exclusive validity of a single standard, being described only as “an illustration.“
367. Sistem Muhendisklik v. Kyrgyz Republic (ICSID):*' Article H11(2) of the Turkey-Kyrgyzstan
BIT provides that, in cases of expropriation, compensation “shall be equivalent to the real value
of the expropriated investment before the expropriatary action was taken or became known.”
The tribunal stressed that “conceptual clarity in valuing assets for the purposes of calculating
compensation payable was desirable; and that if was conscious of the criticism of
‘triangulation’ methods, which select a figure that lies somewhere in the middie ground of

estimates put forward by the parties.“

The tribunal distinguished between: (i) cost-based
valuations that focus on the value of what the investor has invested and lost; and (ii) profit-
based approaches that focus on the value of the asset and the expected profits that the investor
has lost (being the distinction between what the asset cost and what it was worth).*”? In this
case, in which an unlawful expropriation had taken place, the tribunal noted that: “[i}f investors
are given compensation which represents a net income stream that is the same as that which the
investor could rationally and reasonably have expected, at the time of the taking, to derive from
the expropriated investment, and which also reflects the residual value of the investment that
would have generated that income stream, then that compensation will ordinarily discharge the
lability of the State." After rejecting the “replacement value approach’ and a “multiple
deals approach,” the tribunal turned to the Discounted Cash Flow method as the appropriate

standard.“ It applied the definitions set out in the World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of

“5 The tribunal defined this phrase as follows: “The ‘replacement value’ approach to valuation looks to what
the investor has put in, not what the investor could expect to derive from the investment — at what the
investment cost rather than at what it was worth. But there is no necessary relationship between cost and
value. It may take some yeass before an investment builds up a reputation and turnover which raises its value
above the amount that was needed ro create it. Indeed, it may never rise to that value; and if that is so, it is
not the role of a BIT to tum a bad investment into 2 good onc. The investment was worth what it was worth,
regardless of how much it cost.” (para. 160). That is not the Claimant's claim in the present case, despite the
similar terminology.

“real value” with “fair market value.”

368, Rosinvest UK Lid. v. The Russian Federation (SCC): Article 5(1) of the UK-USSR IPPA
(BIT) provides that compensation shall amount to the “real value” of the investment. The
tribunal equated that term with “true value,” taking into account the speculative nature of the
investment itself, as made by the claimant investor: “While it is difficult to make an assessment
of the ‘true value” at the time of purchase, Respondent’s contention that the market price of the
shares reflected the likelihood of Yukes ceasing to exist as a viable company is plausible;” with
the claimant admitting that “some of [its] investments tum out to be profitable, and some do
not, and the investor may be presumed to understand the market risks when it makes the
investment.” Having regard to the speculative nature of the investment, the tribunal decided
that any award of damages that rewarded the claimant's speculation with an amount based on
an ex-post analysis would be “unjust.” The tribunal refused to apply the most optimistic
assessment of an investment and its return: “Claimant is asking the Tribunal not only to realise
and implement the [Claimant's] ‘buy low and sell high’ strategy, but to go further and apply a
best-case approximation of today’s value,"

369. Funnekotter y. Zimbabwe (ICSID)‘“? This was a case where the claimants claimed
compensation for unlawful expropriation of their farms by the respondent, by reference (inter

alia) to Article 6(c) of the Netherlands-Zimbabwe BIT of 1996. This text provides for the

 

payment of; “,.. just compensation. Such compensation shall represent the genuine value of the
investments affected and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made
transferable, without delay, to the country designated by the claimants concemed and in the

exclusively, the net asset vatue thereof as certified by an independent firm of auditors.” The
claimants did not seek the restitution of the expropriated farms; and as regards compensation
the parties disputed (inter alia) the method of calculating the compensation due to the
claimants. The wibunal first noted: “that compensation under Article 6(c} must represent the

‘genuine value of the investment [].’ In certain cases, the net asset value, i.e,, the value as

Jower than the genuine value, compensation will be higher than the met asset value. [...]
Whatever may be the basis of evaluation — general international law or Article 6 — the damages
must correspond to the genuine value of the properties at the time of expropriation [...] The
Tribunal observes that, under genera) international Jaw as well as under the BIT, investors have
a right 10 indemnities corresponding to the value of their investment, independently of the
origin and past success of their investment, as well as of the number and aim of the
expropriations done. It will accordingly proceed to the evaluation of the damages suffered in
each case at the date of dispossession on the basis of the market value at that date” [footnotes
omirted].“**

The Tribunal has also considered whether the issue of disputed interpretation is materially
assisted by legal scholars. Welde & Suhuhi state that, historically, the position of capital-
exporting countries has been to pravide for “full compensation” expressed in terms such as
“prompt, adequate and effective” (i.e. the Hull formula), “market” or “genuine value,“*"
Ripinsky & Williams note that the prevailing BIT standard is “fair market value” and that even

refer to the Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed., 2004) which equates “genuine value,” “actual

Dictionary (9th ed., 2009) equates the term “fair market value” with “actual value,” “just
value” or “full value” but not longer with “genuine value” or “real value.“** Salacuse, after
having identified the term “market value” as common in investment treaties, notes that: “[a]
few treaties are less specific in establishing standards of compensation. Instead of market value,
they may require ‘real value’, ‘reasonable compensation’, or simply ‘compensation.’ These
formulations of a treaty’s standard for compensation provide ample roum for controversy as to

“market value,” “real value,” etc., this author suggests that “market value” and “real value” are

different standards of compensation.

In Commentaries on Selected Model Treaties (ed, Chester Brown), the authors on the
Netherlands Model BIT of 2004 (Nico Schrivjer and Vid Prislan) address the wording of
Article 6(c), cited in English: “Neither Contracting Party shalj take any measures depriving,
directly or indirectly, nationals of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless the
following conditions are complied with: [...] (c) the measures are taken against just
compensation. Such compensation shall represent the genuine value of the investments
affected, shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment and shall,
in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without delay, to the
country designated by the claimants concerned and in the currency of the country of which the
claimants are nationals or in any freely convertible currency aecepted by the claimants.” The
linguistic similarities (albeit not identical) with Article S(c) of lhe Treaty are, of course, self-
evident, particularly with the Claimant's comments on the Dutch version made hy its letter
dated 18 February 2013 (cited above).

372. These same authors comment on the “very capacious and comprehensive compensation clause”

437

contained in Article 6(c) of the Madel BIT, concluding:

By and large, the Jatter reflects the famous Hull formula as it requires that the
payment of compensation be prompt (namely, ‘without delay’), adequate (that is.
representing ‘the genuine value of the investments affected’ including ‘interest at a
normal commercial rate until the date of payment’) and effective (namely, ‘be paid
and made transferable in the currency of the country of which the claimants are
nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants’). The
breadth of the clause reflects the position traditionally maintained by the
Netherlands’ Government that, in case of expropriation, ‘a just and prompt
i ity shall be i diately and effectively [footnote here omitted].
Practically all Dutch BIT’s contain clauses that are similar or identical to the one
used in the Model Text. {...] The clause defines ‘just compensation’ with the
concept of ‘penuine value’, instead of the notion of ‘fair market value’ which
sometimes appears in investment treaties [footnote omitted]. However, there is
nothing that would suggest that the cnncept of ‘genuine value’ may have been
intended to represent a standard that is substantially different from that of ‘fair
market value’ [footnote omitted]. This view has been adopted by several arbitral
tribunals in cases where the applicable Dutch BIT‘s required compensation to
represcnt the ‘genuine value of the investment.’ Hence, according to the tribunal in
CME v. Czech Republic, ‘“fair market value” equates with “just compensation”
that represents the “genuine value” of the property affected’ [footnote omitted].
The tribunal in Fi v. Zimbabwe similarly pi ded to the ion of

the damages on the basis of the market value of the investments at the date of

dispossession, while recalling that the compensation under the BIT must represent

the ‘genuine vaiue of the investment’ [footnote omitted] [...}.‘*
The Tribunal has thought it right to set out these materials at some length to demonstrate that
the issue of interpretation dividing the Parties is not straightforward, with even more that could
be said by each Party in support of its case. The starting-point under Article 5(c) of the Treaty
is “just compensation”, the “real value" of the affected investment events (with the Hull
formula); but it is clear from the legal materials cited above that both legal terms could be
interpreted and applied with a number of different meanings and effects. The Tribunal cannot
decide these matters in the abstract. More significantly, it is premature for the Tribunal to
decide the issue of interpretation in this Award. If it were a straightforward issue easily
answerable, the TribunaJ might succumb to the temptation of providing an answer which could
eventually save much time and trouble for both Parties in the future, particularly if it might
preclude the Partics’ entire dispute and both Parties requested such an answer. That is
manifestly not the present case. Nor is it even clear to the Tribunal that compensation payable
and paid to the Claimant under Polish law would be any different from compensation payable
under the Treaty. As already indicated above, this Tribunal can only address a dispute under
Article 8 of the Treaty; and it cannot act as a legal adviser to the Parties, as a form of deus ex
machina. In the Tribunals view, it would be wrong to decide prematurely a complex issue
which could become critical to both Parties in the future, depending on different material

events.

Accordingly, for these reasons, the Tribunal declines here to go any further in addressing the
scope of compensation under Article 5(c) of the Treaty, given that it cannot address a legal

dispute which does not yet exist juridically between the Parties.

Article 3: The Tribunal now tums briefly to the Claimant's claims under Articles 3(1), 3(2) and
3(S) of the Treaty, for ease of reference described by the Parties as the provisions respectively
for “Fair and Equitable Treatment” (FET), “Full Security and Protection" (FSP) and the
“Umbrella Clause.” In the light of the Tribunal’s several decisions above, it is appropriate to

decide these claims summarily.

As regards the FET Standard {which includes @ non-impairment provision), the Tribunal does
not accept the Claimant's characterisation of conduct by or attributable to the Respondent in the

form of improper ‘threats’. There is no doubt that relations hetween Enkev Pulska and the City

380.

of Lédz became difficult and disputatious with impatience and misunderstandings on both
sides. That is insufficient to constitute unlawful conduct by the City, nor indeed by Enkev
Polska or the Claimant. In particular, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s treatment as a “threat”
of the letter dated 17 October 2012. Jt could have been better expressed; but, in the Tribunal’s
view, the Claimant is wrong to interpret its text in such extreme terms given its overall context
and surrounding circumstances. As already decided above, there is no cogent evidence of any
arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory conduct by the City of Lodé or the Respondent; nor
indeed any act or omission amounting to a breach of the FET Standard, whether interpreted as

an autonomous standard or as the minimum standard under international law.

The Tribunal rejects the Claimant's case under the FSP Standard. The Tribunal does not
consider that the City mistreated the Claimant (or Enkev Polska) over the failed attempts to
value the Premises; nor was there any material omission to keep the Claimant informed as to
the City’s intentions towards the Premises. The Tribunal also notes, again, that the procedures
for the City’s planned expropriation under the Road Legislation have only recently reached the
first step, with several further administrative and legal steps still lying in the future. Poland is a
Member State of the European Union, operating under the rule of law (including EU law); and
whilst that provides at most only a rebuttable presumption, there is no due process violation
established by the Claimant on the evidence adduced in this case at this early stage of these

procedures, The Claimant's complaint is, at the very least, premature.

The Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s case under the Umbrella Clause, for want of any obligation
existing by the Respondent towards the Claimant (including Enkev Polska). The so-called
“assurances” of 2010 and 2011 invoked by the Claimant were directed at Enkev Polska (not the
Claimant); and, from their terms, neither can be considered as an obligation within the meaning
of the Umbrella Clause. In the Tribunal's view, such “assurances” fell far short of creating any

new legal obligation not already imposed upon the City by Polish law towards Enkev Polska.

In conclusion, but most importantly of all, none of these complaints alleged by the Claimant
impugn the Respondent’s treatment of the Claimant's rights derived from its shares in Enkev
Polska: all such complaints, as pleaded by the Claimant, are directed solely at the treatment of
Enkey Polska itself and its Premises. That suffices to cause the Tribunal to dismiss the

Claimant's claims under Article 3 of the Treaty.

Summary: Accordingly, for these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses all the Claimant’s substantive
claims under Articles 5 and 3 of the Treaty. It remains only for the Tribunal to address the

consequences of such dismissal.

First, the Tribunal discharges all orders for interim measures made to date; and it confirms its
rejection on 23 March 2014 of the Claimant's application for further interim measures made by

Procedural Order No 7 of 10 February 2014.

Second, in principle but here only provisionally, the Tribunal indicates that it is at present
minded to allocate all legal and arbitration costs of these proceedings against the Claimant as
the overall unsuccessful party under Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, subject
lo their assessment and subject also to the Claimant showing cause why such a provisional
indication should not be made as a final decision pursuant to Articles 40(1) and 42(2) of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, under a procedure to be fixed in consultation with the Parties
following their receipt of this Award.

Nonetheless, the Tribunal makes no order for legal and arbitration costs in this Award,

reserving in full its jurisdiction, powers and discretion to do so under a further order or award.
