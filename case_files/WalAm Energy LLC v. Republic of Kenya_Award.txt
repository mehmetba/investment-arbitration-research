INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Geothermal Resources
Licence No. 1/2007 (the “Licence”) and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on

14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The claimant is WalAm Energy Inc. (“WalAm” or the “Claimant”’), a company
incorporated under the laws of Nevada, U.S.A. in 2017, and registered in Alberta, Canada.
The respondent is the Republic of Kenya (“Kenya” or the “Respondent”).

The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’
representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

This dispute relates to Kenya’s allegedly unlawful declaration of forfeiture, on 1 November
2012, of the Licence to explore and develop the Suswa geothermal concession, which had

been obtained by WalAm from Kenya’s Ministry of Energy on 5 September 2007.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 30 January 2015, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration from WalAm Energy Inc.
against Kenya.

By letter dated 6 February 2015, ICSID requested that the Claimant provide further
information, in the following terms:

We refer to the Request for Arbitration dated January 26, 2015 (the
“Request” ) of Walam Energy Inc. (“WalAm”).

As we proceed with the review of the Request, we ask that you
provide ICSID with the following:

Pursuant to ICSID Institution Rule 2(1)(d)(i), please explain how
WalAm qualified as a national of an ICSID Contracting State,
pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, on the date of the

8.

consent to arbitration, alleged to be September 5, 2007 (Request,
paras. 68, 74-75).

We ask that you provide us with the above-listed clarification by
February 13, 2015.

Under the cover of a letter dated 11 February 2015, the Claimant filed “Submissions on

WalAm’s Consent to ICSID Arbitration” which, in its conclusive part, read:
Based on the above, the Claimant respectfully submits that:

(i) By agreement of the Parties, the Claimant is a national of
Canada for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

(ii) Canada became a Contracting State, in accordance with
Article 68 of the ICSID Convention, on Ist December 2013.

(iii) | The Claimant gave conditional consent to submit any dispute
between the Parties to ICSID arbitration when it entered into the
arbitration agreement in the Licence on Sth September 2007. The
Claimant’s consent became fully effective on Ist December 2013,
when Canada became an ICSID Contracting State.

(iv) The Claimant is willing to amend paragraph 74 of the
Request to clarify the effective date of the Claimant’s consent as Ist
December 2013 and awaits the Secretary-General’s directions in
this regard.

(v) The requirements of Article 25 have been fulfilled and the

Request should proceed to registration.
On 23 February 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In
the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute
an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre’s Rules
of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.
By letter of 8 April 2015, the Claimant provided further information to ICSID regarding its
status as a national of another Contracting State under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

The letter read as follows:

We refer to the Notice of Registration of this matter dated
23 February 2015.

Given that the case is now registered, the Claimant will make such
further submissions on jurisdiction as may be required before the
Tribunal at the appropriate juncture.

In the interim, and purely for the purposes of clarification, we wish
to advise that the Claimant’s case regarding how the Claimant
qualified as a national of another Contracting State, pursuant to
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, rests upon three points in
particular:

(a) The parties have agreed that the Claimant is a national of
Canada! (as stated at para 1 and para 68 of the Request for
Arbitration); and/or

(b) The Claimant has its registered office and seat in Canada
(as stated at page | of the Request for Arbitration); and/or

(c) The Claimant is incorporated in the United States of
America? (as stated at page 1 and para 9 of the Request for
Arbitration).

Yours faithfully,

’ Canada signed the ICSID Convention on 15 December 2006 and
became a party to the same on I November 2013. Canada remains
a party to the ICSID Convention to this day. See also paragraphs 7
to 12 of the Claimant’s submissions on Claimant’s consent to ICSID
arbitration dated I] February 2015.

? The United States of America (‘USA’) signed the ICSID

Convention on 27 August 1965 and became a party to the same on

14 October 1966. The USA remains a party to the ICSID Convention

to this day.
By letter of 27 April 2015, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal in this case be
constituted pursuant to the formula provided by Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.
The Centre reminded the Parties that the 60-day period after registration of the Request in
this case had elapsed and informed the Respondent that pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule
2(3), the Tribunal in this case was to be constituted pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the
ICSID Convention. The Centre further invited the Claimant and the Respondent to inform
ICSID of their appointment of an arbitrator and of their proposals for the President of the

Tribunal.

20.

21.

By letter of 30 April 2015, the Claimant appointed Mr Swithin J. Munyantwali, a dual
national of Uganda and the United Kingdom, as arbitrator, and proposed a President of the

Tribunal.

By letter of 9 June 2015, the Respondent (i) appointed Mr James Spigelman AC QC, a
national of Australia, as arbitrator, (ii) rejected the Claimant’s proposal for President of the

Tribunal, and (iii) proposed a different candidate as President of the Tribunal.

By letter of 10 June 2015, the Centre informed the Parties that on 30 April 2015, it had
informed Mr Munyantwali of his appointment as arbitrator in this case by the Claimant,
but it was unsuccessful in its attempts to contact him. Consequently, the Centre invited the
Claimant to proceed to the appointment of another arbitrator in accordance with the method

followed for the appointment of Mr Munyantwali.

By letter of 11 June 2015, the Centre informed the Parties that Mr Munyantwali confirmed

that he had only received the letter informing him of his appointment on 9 June 2015.

By letter of 12 June 2015, ICSID notified the Parties of Mr Munyantwali’s acceptance of

his appointment.

By letter of 15 June 2015, ICSID notified the Parties of Mr Spigelman’s acceptance of his

appointment.

By letter of 23 June 2015, the Claimant rejected the Respondent’s proposed candidate for
President of the Tribunal and proposed a list of three candidates for the role of President of
the Tribunal. By letter of 13 July 2015, the Respondent rejected the Claimant’s proposals

and proposed three new candidates for the role of the President of the Tribunal.

By letter of 10 August 2015, the Claimant proposed three further candidates to the
Respondent.

By letter of 30 December 2015, the Centre asked the Parties for an update on the status of
the appointment of the President of the Tribunal in this case.

On 14 January 2016, the Claimant wrote to ICSID “to follow-up on Claimant's letters of
February 11, 2015 and April 8, 2015” and to request “that the case details for this matter

on ICSID’s website add the United States to the nationality listing, and that for

jurisdictional purposes, ICSID treat WalAm as a national of the United States and/or

Canada.”

On 17 January 2016, ICSID wrote to the Parties to confirm that it would update its website
per the Claimant’s request, to recall that the listing of nationalities on ICSID’s website “is
without prejudice to any argument of the parties or holding of the Tribunal” and to indicate
that the “Claimant’s request that WalAm Energy Inc. be treated as a national of the United
States and/or Canada for jurisdictional purposes is for the Tribunal, once constituted, to

decide and cannot be addressed by ICSID.”

By emails of 17 and 18 February 2016, the Claimant and the Respondent informed the
Centre of their agreement on a candidate to serve as President of the Tribunal in this case
pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. By letter of 19 February 2016, the

Centre informed the Parties that that nominee had declined the appointment.

By letter of 29 March 2016, the Respondent requested, on behalf of both Parties, the
Centre’s assistance with the process to identify and appoint the President of the Tribunal

and submitted a list ranking procedure agreed upon by the Parties.

By letter of 1 April 2016, the Centre proposed to the Parties timetables for (i) the
constitution of their lists of candidates, (ii) the ranking of the candidates and (iii) the
selection of the President of the Tribunal. The Respondent and the Claimant confirmed
their agreement on the proposed timetables by emails dated 4 and 7 April 2016,

respectively.

By letter of 21 April 2016, the Centre submitted a list of ten candidates for the appointment

of the President of the Tribunal to the Parties.

By correspondence exchanged on 26, 27, 28 April, and 8 May 2016, the Parties discussed
and agreed on the removal of one of the candidates on the list proposed by the Centre on

21 April 2016.

By letter of 9 May 2016, the Centre asked the Parties to confirm whether it should identify
a new candidate, check his or her availability and provide the Parties with an updated list
of ten names, and whether the ranked list previously transmitted to them by the Claimant,

should be disregarded.

As requested by the Parties, by letter of 17 May 2016, the Centre submitted a new ranked

list of ten candidates for the appointment of the President of the Tribunal.

By letter of 23 May 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that the ranked-list procedure
was successful and that they had appointed Mr Joe Smouha QC, a national of the United

Kingdom, as the presiding arbitrator in this case.

By letter of 2 June 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule
6(1) notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that
the Tribunal was constituted on that date. Mr Benjamin Garel, ICSID Legal Counsel, was

designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

By letter of 21 June 2016, the Centre circulated a draft agenda and a draft Procedural Order
No. | to help the Parties prepare for the first session and to help them reach an agreement

on the agenda items.

On 7 July 2016, the Tribunal confirmed to the Parties that the first session would take place

in London on 6 September 2016.
On 9 August 2016, the Respondent submitted Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction.

On 16 August 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had not reached an
agreement on three items in draft Procedural Order No. 1, namely, the place of the

proceedings, the question of bifurcation and the procedural calendar.

On 22 August 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file short written submissions on the
remaining contentious items by 2 September 2016 and informed the Parties of its wish to

hear them orally on the same issues during the first session.

On 2 September 2016, the Parties filed their submissions on the items in draft Procedural

Order No. | they did not agree upon.

The first session of the Tribunal with the Parties was held at the International Dispute
Resolution Centre in London on 6 September 2016. During the first session, the Parties
confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted, that they had no objection to the
appointment of any member of the Tribunal and that they agreed on the application of the
2006 version of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Tribunal further invited the Parties to
submit revised proposed timetables for this proceeding.

On 7 September 2016, as instructed by the Tribunal during the first session, each Party

submitted their proposed timetables.

On 26 September 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, whereby it decided (i)
that the place of the proceedings shall be Washington, D.C. and (ii) to bifurcate the
proceedings. The Tribunal attached to Procedural Order No. | a draft procedural timetable
as Annex A and a draft Procedural Order No. 2 as Annex B.! The Tribunal invited the
Parties to comment on draft Procedural Order No. 2 by 30 September 2016, and asked them
to confirm their preference as to the location for the oral hearing scheduled for 6 and

7 February 2017 in respect of the jurisdiction phase.

On 13 October 2016, further to the Parties’ communications of 30 September 2016 and
4 October 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 together with Annex A, the
procedural timetable. The Tribunal also took note of the Parties’ agreement to hold the

hearing on jurisdiction in London.

On 21 October 2016, the Claimant filed a Response to Preliminary Objections to

Jurisdiction.

By letter of 28 October 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that due to an internal
redistribution of workload at the Centre, Ms Ella Rosenberg had been assigned to serve as

Secretary of the Tribunal in this case.

On 18 November 2016, the Respondent filed a Reply on Preliminary Objections to

Jurisdiction.

On 16 December 2016, the Claimant filed a Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections to

Jurisdiction.

On 29 December 2016, Mr. Munyantwali asked the Centre to transmit to the Parties, a

declaration stating:

One of my Geneva-based colleagues at Appleton Luff, an
international boutique law firm with which I am a member, is in the
process of exploring a potential opportunity to advise the Kenyan
Trade Ministry. As a potential conflict matter, I raise this due to my

' Draft Procedural Order No.1 was circulated to the Parties on 21 June 2016 and discussed at the first session. It was
re-numbered as draft Procedural Order No. 2 upon issuance of Procedural Order No. 1.

role as an arbitrator in the Walam Energy Inc. vs. Republic of Kenya
Arbitration.

I would have no involvement whatsoever in project implementation,

nor would I benefit from any remuneration should the opportunity

materialize. My assurance to the parties, is that this will in no away

affect my judgement in the pending arbitration.
In his declaration, Mr. Munyantwali asked the Parties whether they objected to his partner’s
pursuit of the matter and stated “[m]y colleague who is sensitive to my involvement on the
arbitration panel will abide by any decision reached.”
By letter of 3 January 2017, the Claimant requested that Mr Munyantwali provide

additional details regarding the mandate being considered, before responding.

By letter of 9 January 2017, the Respondent confirmed that it had no objection to
Mr Munyantwali’s partner pursuing the potential opportunity to advise the Kenyan Trade
Ministry.

By letter of 11 January 2017, Mr Munyantwali provided the additional information
requested by the Claimant, and by letter of 26 January 2017, the Claimant responded that
it was “not comfortable with Appleton Luff being engaged by Respondent at this time.” On
the following day, in response to this communication, Mr. Munyantwali wrote “[mJany

thanks for this communication which I understand, and will convey.”

By letter of 11 January 2017, the Centre informed the Parties that the Tribunal would not
be available for a pre-hearing telephone conference on 25 January 2017, as provided in

Procedural Order No. 2, and proposed to hold it on 27 January 2017.

By letter of 13 January 2017, the Centre confirmed that the pre-hearing organizational

meeting would take place on 27 January 2017.

By letter of 17 January 2017, the Centre circulated a draft agenda for the pre-hearing
organizational meeting, and the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit, by 24 January 2017,
a joint proposal containing their points of agreement and their respective positions where

they were unable to reach an agreement.

54.

55.

56.

By email of 24 January 2017, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Claimant’s letter
transmitting the Parties’ joint proposal on the draft agenda for the pre-hearing

organizational meeting.

On 27 January 2017, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting by telephone

Hon Prof Muigai, Mr Rubins, Mr Juratowitch and Ms Stephens-Chu presented oral

arguments on behalf of the Claimant.

The hearing on jurisdiction was sound recorded and a verbatim transcript was produced.
Both the recording and the transcript were subsequently distributed to the Parties in

accordance with paragraph 21 of Procedural Order No. 2 on 10 February 2017.
On 21 February 2017, the Parties submitted their respective submissions on costs.

On 27 March 2017, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, which forms part of
this Award. The Decision on Jurisdiction dismissed the Respondent’s objections, namely
(i) that there was no consent by the Respondent to ICSID arbitration because the Claimant
did not have the nationality of a Contracting State (as required by Article 25(2)(b)) either
at the date the Licence was issued or at any later relevant date and (ii), that the Tribunal
lacked jurisdiction ratione temporis because the act that formed the basis of the claims (the
forfeiture of the Licence) preceded the entry into force of the ICSID Convention between

Canada and Kenya.
The dispositive part of the Decision on Jurisdiction reads as follows:
i. Dismisses Respondent’s Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction;

ii. Reserves questions of costs of the jurisdictional phase in
accordance with paragraph 248 above; and

iii. Orders the merits phase of the proceedings to proceed with the
Claimant’s Memorial being filed on 28 March 2017 and the
Procedural Timetable to continue thereafter in accordance with the

Procedural Timetable as set out in Annex A to Procedural Order

No. 2.
On 28 March 2017, the Claimant requested an extension until 29 March 2017, to file its
Memorial on the Merits in order to take into account the Tribunal’s Decision on

Jurisdiction. Tribunal granted the Claimant’s request on the same date.

On 29 March 2017, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits, Exhibits C-047 through
C-116, Legal Authorities CL-048 through CL-132, together with the First Expert Report of
Mr Santiago Dellepiane A., the Witness Statement of Dr. Gordon Bloomquist, the Witness
Statement of Mr Alexander Laing, the First Witness Statement of Mr Maherab Walji, and

the First Witness Statement of Dr Subir Sanyal.

By email of 3 April 2017, the Claimant gave its consent to the publication of the Decision

on Jurisdiction.

By letter of 7 April 2017, the Respondent informed the Centre that it did not consent to the
publication of the Decision on ICSID’s website. The Respondent made an application for
an order, pursuant to Rule 19 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, that the Parties “preserve the
confidentiality of the Decision until the Award is issued” (the “Confidentiality
Application”). The Respondent submitted that “[a]ny publication of the Decision at this
stage would carry with it the risk of adverse publicity in relation to this arbitration that
may expose employees of the Kenyan government who are familiar with the facts relevant
to this case to external pressures that may make them unwilling to contribute to or be
associated with the Respondent’s defence.” The Respondent also made a request for certain

amendments to the Decision on Jurisdiction.

By letter of 27 April 2017, the Claimant indicated that it had no objection to the
amendments requested by the Respondent. In relation to the Confidentiality Application,
the Claimant indicated, inter alia, that it was only willing to agree to keep the Decision on

Jurisdiction confidential until the Tribunal’s Award, on certain conditions.

By letter of 9 May 2017, the Respondent filed a response to the Claimant’s observations
dated 27 April 2017, declining to agree to the proposed conditions and maintaining its

Confidentiality Application.

By letter of 11 May 2017, the Tribunal sent the Parties a revised Decision on Jurisdiction
(marked “Revised Version”) maintaining the same dispatch date, containing the

amendments agreed upon by the Parties and the Tribunal.

On 18 May 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning the confidentiality
of the Decision on Jurisdiction whereby it declined the Respondent’s Confidentiality
Application. The Tribunal stated:

The Tribunal accordingly refuses the Respondent’s application in

the form made. The Tribunal is confident that the Parties will

respect the integrity of the proceedings and will act responsibly in

deciding whether to publish any information about the outcome of

the preliminary phase and the reasoning of the Decision, and if any

decision is made so to publish, to do so in an accurate and balanced

way.
On 31 October 2017, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits,

Parties’ outstanding requests for the production of documents.

On 23 January 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that a potential issue had arisen due

to the Parties a declaration stating:

An Institute, the International Law Institute African Centre for Legal
Excellence (“ILI-ACLE”) for which I am Vice Chair has been
approached by the Kenyan Government to carry out training
activities on extractives. In addition to serving on the board of the
ILI-ACLE, I serve on the international board of International Law
Institute in Washington, DC (“ILI”). Both Institutes are regularly
requested by developing countries world-wide to carry out training
and technical assistance, and in the case of the Africa Centre, to do
so for countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa. As a board
member, Iam not involved in the day-to-day affairs of the Institutes.

I am confident that even if the Institute does go ahead with the
Kenyan request, it will not affect my impartiality on the Tribunal. As
is the case in all instances, I will have no involvement in any aspects
to decide the handling of the request, or during implementation.

On 4 May 2018, the Parties informed the Centre that they had no objection to the ILIL-ACLE

pursuing the matter identified in Mr Munyantwali’s declaration.

proceedings should be amended accordingly.

BACKGROUND OF GEOTHERMAL DEVELOPMENT IN KENYA AND THE
LEGISLATIVE CONTEXT

BACKGROUND OF GEOTHERMAL DEVELOPMENT IN KENYA
(dd) Introduction

This section sets out the general context of geothermal development in Kenya during the
2007-2012 period, the relevant timeline of the WalAm dispute. By way of commercial
context, it also identifies some of the principal issues and challenges for a developer that

could be expected to arise in a new geothermal development project, such as Suswa.

(2) Context

Exploitation of Kenya’s geothermal resources has been ongoing since the 1950’s. The bulk
of these resources are located in the “Kenya Rift that transects the country from north to

south.

2 [CJ-021], Geothermal Development in Kenya: A Country Update — 2012, Peter A, Omenda (“GDC 2012 Country
Update”), p. 89.

22

The geothermal activity in the East African rift occurs in the form of
hot springs, fumaroles, hot and altered grounds. ... During the last
2 million years ... volcanic activities became more intense within
the axis of the rift due to extension. ... Shield volcanoes, most of
which are geothermal prospects, developed in the axis of the rift.
The volcanoes include Suswa, Longonot, Olkaria, Eburru, Menegai,
Korosi, Paka, Silali, Emuruangogolak and Barrier.*

 

143. Currently, the principal source of energy in Kenya is petroleum and electricity, with wood

fuel meeting the energy needs for the traditional sector, comprising the rural communities

and the urban poor. National energy use breaks down as follows: wood fuel and biomass

(68%), petroleum (22%), electricity (9%), coal and others (<1%). Solar energy is also

increasingly used for drying, heating and lighting.*

144. Kenya has sought to focus on geothermal power for a number of reasons:*

a.

b.

Climate change has made hydro power unreliable;
The potential abundance of geothermal resources;
It is a green energy source with no emissions;

It is a least cost source of power;

It is an indigenous resource;

It is not affected by adverse weather conditions;

It has high availability (>95%); and

The cost of power can be predictable over the plant life.

The GDC Report of 2012 referred to the development of Government policy until the time
that the Licence the subject of these proceedings was granted:

The Least Cost Power Development Plan (2010-2030) prepared by

the Government of Kenya indicates that Geothermal plants have the

lowest unit costs and therefore suitable for baseload and thus,

recommended for additional expansion.°
Kenya’s Vision 2030 Strategy indicates that energy is a key (one of three pillars)
infrastructure enabler to transform the country to middle income status by 2030. “The level
and intensity of commercial energy use is viewed as a key indicator of [Kenya’s] socio-
economic development.” Kenya therefore expects more energy use in its path towards
Vision 2030. Key stakeholders are positioning to meet the energy demand ultimately

allowing Kenya to meet its Vision 2030, and the first Medium Term Plan 2012-2016.’

(3) Status of Geothermal Development

The southern segment of the Kenya Rift Valley is a unique petrological province
comprising of at least four Quaternary to Recent volcanic complexes (from south to north):
Suswa, Longonot, Olkaria and Eburru. Although these volcanoes are located only about
40 km from each other, the eruptive rock types from each volcano are compositionally
different. Active geothermal systems are associated with each of these volcanic complexes
although only Olkaria and Eburru have been developed for power generation (currently

206 MWe and growing).

In reporting on the largest concentration of potential geothermal activity in Kenya, the

GDC 2012 Country Update noted in relevant part:

The centers are dotted with hydrothermal activity and are envisaged
to host extensive geothermal systems. The prospects from south to
north are Lake Magadi, Suswa, Longonot, Olkaria, Eburru,
Badlands, Menegai, Arus Bogoria, Lake Baringo, Korosi, Paka,
Silali, Emuruangogolak, Namarunu and Barrier.®

149. The report detailed exploration of geothermal energy commencing in the 1960s as follows:

Kenya started in the 1960’s with surface exploration that
culminated in two geothermal wells being drilled at Olkaria. In the
early 1970's more geological and geophysical work was carried out
between Lake Bogoria and Olkaria. This survey identified several
areas suitable for geothermal prospecting and by 1973, drilling of
deep exploratory wells at Olkaria commenced and was funded by
UNDP. The Government through the Ministry of Energy, GDC,
KenGen and other partners has undertaken detailed surface studies
of some of the most promising geothermal prospects in the country.

The areas that have been studied include Suswa, Longonot, Olkaria
[and other] geothermal prospects. Evaluation of these data sets
suggest that over 10,000 MWe can be generated from the high
temperature resource areas in Kenya.°

150. Regarding current active sites for geothermal development the SKM Development Plan

notes:

Active geothermal systems are associated with each of these
volcanic complexes although only Olkaria and Eburru [(described
below)] have been developed for power generation (currently 206
MWe and growing).'°

151. Suswa: Suswa, the subject of the current dispute is located in the Kenya Rift Valley,

approximately 50 km west-northwest of Nairobi and 25 km south of the Olkaria geothermal

development."
152. It is described as follows:

The Suswa geothermal prospect is located in the Kenya Rift Valley,
approximately 50 km west northwest of Nairobi and 25 km south of
the Olkaria geothermal development. The Kenya Rift Valley is part
of the East African Rift system that runs from Ethiopia in the north
(the Afar triple junction) to Beira, Mozambique in the south. ...

Suswa is made up of two calderas; the inner (younger) and the outer
caldera. The outer caldera is a 12 x 10 km ellipse with a general
orientation of ENE-WSW. The inner caldera has a diameter of about

4 km and the central resurgent block measures about 3 km in
diameter.

Geothermal manifestations (fumaroles, hot ground) primarily occur
within the annular trench particularly along the northern half of the
inner caldera. The presence of fumaroles indicates high
temperatures at least in the central part of the system. Based on the
geological setting and descriptions of fumarolic activity and steam-
heated features, a high-temperature geothermal system is likely at
Suswa.

Previous studies indicated that a geothermal reservoir probably
exists beneath Suswa Volcano; however, the temperature,
chemistry, size, and exact location of this system have yet to be
determined. The geothermal potential of the Suswa prospect was
initially recognized many decades ago. In more recent times a
comprehensive series of investigations of the geothermal potential
of Suswa has been carried out, including geology, geochemistry and
geophysics."?

153. The most important studies for Suswa’s viability include:
e Geothermal and geological surveys by UNDP (led by Helgi
Torfason), 1987

e Surface investigations including geophysical surveys by
Geotermica Italiana, 1989

e British Geological Survey, 1990

e Surface and geological investigations by Kenya Power
Company, 1993 — 94

e Geology and the geothermal systems of the southern segment of
the Kenya Rift by Lagat, 2003"

154. As discussed in the Section IV below, these reports and others were reviewed and analysed
by GeothermEx Inc of San Francisco California under contract to WalAm Energy Inc.
“GeothermEx concluded that there was a 90% probability of developing at least 75 MWe
of generation at the Suswa site and a 50% probability of developing 200 MWe for a project

life of 30 years. They also concluded that the project [could] proceed to drilling of full

diameter wells without the need for further surface exploration."

(4) Institutional Structure

155. The Kenyan power sector was the subject of reform from the mid-1990s, resulting in the
Energy Act 2006.'°
156. The following are the key elements of the structure:
(a) Ministry of Energy and Petroleum
157. Under the Energy Act, the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum is responsible for
promulgation of policy, and facilitating an environment for all participants in the energy
sector.'° The relevant part of the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum role is described as
follows:
[T]he Ministry of Energy’s geo-exploration department formulates
fiscal, legal and regulatory frameworks and policies, including
setting the feed-in tariff for geothermal projects. ... Licenses for
exploration and drilling in relation to geothermal IPPs would have
to be negotiated and obtained through the Ministry.”
(b) Energy Regulatory Commission (“ERC”)'*
PART II - ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

158. Through its commission, it safeguards the interests of Kenya’s electricity consumers. '”
159. The Geothermal Resources Regulations, 1990, Regulation 3(2) states as follows:

A geothermal resources license shall be accompanied by, or be
conditional upon, the execution of a contract (to be known as
“geothermal resources contract”) between the licensee and the
relevant Government department or other body designated by the
Minister for the purpose of providing for the utilization of the
geothermal resources.”

(c) Kenya Electricity Generation Company (“KenGen”’)

160. KenGen is the leading power generation company in the country, supplying the bulk (80%)
of the electricity sold on a wholesale basis to Kenya Power & Lighting Company, also
referred to as Kenya Power.”! KenGen “has an installed capacity of 1,564 MW [as of
March 2015], which accounts for 68% of total installed capacity from various sources

[(described below)]”.” It is publicly listed (on the Nairobi Stock Exchange), with 30%

private shareholders and 70% government ownership.” It provides energy from a variety
of resources, which include hydro, geothermal and thermal. As of 2012, KenGen owned

and operated the Olkaria I and II geothermal power plants.”

(d) Kenya Power & Lighting Company (“KPLC”)

161. KPLC “is the wholesale buyer of electricity, and is obligated to purchase electricity from
all power generators — including KenGen and IPPs{?*] — on the basis of negotiated Power
Purchase Agreements. [KPLC] is responsible for onward transmission of purchased
electricity and is the sole distributor of electricity from the national grid to consumers in
Kenya. [KPLC] is listed on the Nairobi Stock Exchange is 49.9% owned by private
shareholders, with the remainder [50.1%] owned by the Government of Kenya, and is
profitable and creditworthy”. Its network covers approximately 41,486 kilometers.”’

KPLC is the national offtaker for power in Kenya.*

(e) Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (“KETRACO”)

In 2008, the Kenyan government created KETRACO to develop new,
high-voltage electricity transmission infrastructure to facilitate grid
access for rural areas, allow for grid interconnection with new
generating plants. ... KETRACO is 100% owned by the Government

of Kenya and is responsible for planning, designing, constructing,

owning, operating, and maintaining new high voltage (132 kV and

above) electricity transmission infrastructure.”

(f) Geothermal Development Company (“GDC”)

162. GDC, wholly owned by the Government of Kenya, was established in December 2008 to
facilitate development of 5,000 MW by 2030. Part of GDC’s remit was to enhance
geothermal development in the country; “it has a 10-year US$2.6 billion exploration plan
which will involve drilling 566 wells and locating 2,336 MW of geothermal energy. These
potential energy reserves have been located in 14 ‘high-potential’ areas and estimates of
their value are around US$30 billion.”*! GDC was also to ease investment in the sector by
facilitating entry by private developers, by removing upfront risks, reducing costs (through
infrastructural development), exploration work and production drilling, and selling steam

to power producers.”

163. It was also “responsible for entering into Steam Sales Agreements with investors in the
electricity sector, including KenGen and IPPs, in order that these entities can develop

electricity generation capacity with energy sourced from geothermal wells”.**

(g) Independent Power Producers (“IPPs”)

164. The relevant section of the US Power Africa Report, though describing the later 2013-2014

position describes IPPs as follows:

[P]rivate investors in the power sector involved in generation either
on a large scale or in renewable energy projects under the Feed-in-
Tariff Policy. The IPPs listed below, currently contribute about 28%
to the country’s installed capacity (numbers below are in MWs):

framework for the use of nuclear energy in Kenya” .*

(5) Investment and private participation in the power sector

In recent years the electricity sector has evolved from a monopolistic to competitive one,
where previously, KPLC exclusively handled generation, transmission, and distribution.*°
With the generation liberalisation of the sector “several licensed IPPs now in operation,
and the transmission function of KPLC is now vested in KETRACO.”*"

Kenya is open to both private sector investments from local sources

as well as from foreign sources of capital, and has developed a

number of policies aimed at attracting foreign capital. FDI into

Kenya has shown significant increase in the last ten years as

companies respond to incentives by investing in Kenya’s privatized

industries and infrastructure.*
It is required that all energy activities comply with sustainable and environmentally
acceptable practices. The Kenyan government has targeted the private sector to deliver the

substantial electricity deficit, which is being implemented through public private

168. The legislative structure is set out in detail in the factual section below.

(7) Challenges to developing a Geothermal Project

169. The Sinclair Knight Merz Development Plan (“SKM”) outlines the principal challenges
that were present in developing a geothermal project in Kenya at the time. These can be
seen from the SKM Report Risk Register’! which listed the risks in developing a

geothermal project:

173.

Some of the more important and relevant of those risks are discussed in more detail below.

(a) Lending Regime
If a project is to be financed by a multilateral institution the considerations are quite
different from those considered by commercial banks. Commercial banks do not
participate in these projects due to the short tenor (five to six years) and high cost of

capital.”

Furthermore, project financing in Africa (unlike Europe) results in project sponsors having
to come up with more equity; “[a]nd the equity has much higher expectations’ resulting
in the promoter having to manage those expectations and ensuring the lenders understand
what to realistically expect. The most active lenders in this space are the bilaterals, and
multilaterals, such as the World Bank IFC, African Development Bank, European

Investment Bank, and others including Bank DEG, Frontier Markets, Proparco.“*

(b) Resource Risk

Resource risk is the first risk to consider when developing a geothermal project. The basic
question here is whether a commercial reservoir exists in the area to be developed. “Until
exploration, including drilling and initial well testing, has confirmed the existence of a
commercial resource, no bank or financial institution will provide project financing. ...
[E]xploration or initial drilling ... is financed by some combination of equity contribution,
corporate funds, corporate loans and public power revenue band issues, depending on

project ownership.”*

174.

175.

176.

Even following the discovery of a commercially attractive resource (following
geoscientific surveys and drilling), the size of the resource and its ability to produce at a
commercially sustainable rate cannot be determined with certainty. These risks may affect
the bankability of the project until sufficient wells have been drilled and tested to
demonstrate adequate resources for a commercially viable project. It is helpful (in
defraying perceived risk) if an adjoining area has demonstrated commercial viability, in
which case only one or two wells needs to be drilled for a financial institution to consider
the project bankable.** “Jf the project is the first one to be developed in a field, typically
10% to more than 30% of the production necessary to supply the plant needs to be proven
before project financing can be obtained; the higher the perceived resource risk, the higher

the required level of proven production.”

Following confirmation of reservoir size, well production and injection capacity,
substantial uncertainty remains to the financial resources required for development, and
costs of “operating and maintaining the steam (or hot water) supply to the plant from year
to year.”** These factors are considered in the due diligence process towards project
financing. It is not uncommon for such projects to have cost overruns due to higher than
anticipated operations and maintenance costs; this is a concern for lenders as it directly

impacts loan performance.

(c) Environmental and Permitting Risk

It is not uncommon for projects to be substantially delayed (by many years) due to delays
in obtaining necessary environmental approvals. “Other projects have suffered shorter but
still significant delays or have been burdened with an unexpected environmental
evaluation, monitoring or mitigation cost. ... In some projects, unexpected environmental
issues have arisen after the field has already been developed and power generation has
started. For these reasons, a significant part of the due diligence effort before project

financing now consists of assessing environmental and permitting risks associated with the

6 Id.

36

resource not only prior to or during field development, but also subsequently during power

plant operation.””

From the above discussion it is apparent that resource risk
perception of the investors and bankers is determined primarily by
the potential cost consequence of the risk. If the resource risk cannot
be managed or mitigated, it will result in increased cost, loss of
revenue, or both, at times leading to economic failure and shut down
of the project. If the cost consequences of the resource risk is
relatively small compared to that of the other risks, or if the reward-
to-risk ratio is sufficiently large, the resource risks appear
negligible.

Increased costs due to unmitigated or unmanageable resource risks
accrue to the developer and the equity investors. In certain cases the
costs can be passed on to lenders (default and rescheduling of loan
repayment) or to the public (increased power cost or taxes). This in
turn may cause investors or lenders to shun future geothermal
projects, or to increase the requirement for either a corporate
guaranty or cash reserves to be built up from project revenues.
Often such cash reserves are maintained in the form of a revolving
account that is used to fund unforeseen operations and maintenance
costs; as the project incurs such costs, the developer is required to
replenish the reserves from its project earnings. The final
consequence of these unmitigated resource risks is to make future
geothermal projects costlier to finance, and thus less likely to
succeed economically.”

(d) Mitigation Of Resource Risk*'

177. Financiers employ a number of due diligence measures towards mitigating resource risk.

Relevant ones are highlighted below:

a. Adequate exploration of the field before development plans are made;
b. Develop careful profitability criteria towards servicing project debt;
“Ta.
50 Td. at p. 2913.
Sl Id.

37

178.

179.

Selection of projects where developers have prior experience;
Careful review of development plans before making financial commitments;

Ensuring all environmental requirements and other regulatory issues have been
complied with towards ensuring there are no delays which could impact cost, and

timeliness of project implementation;
Routine milestone review meetings;
Risk-sharing by increasing the number of investors and lenders to the project; and

Careful risk shifting through purchasing various insurance against various man-

made failures.

(e) Resource Verification Required By Lenders

In order to minimize resource risk, lenders require verification of the resource during the

period the bulk of the capital is at risk. Relevant considerations before closing of a

geothermal construction loan include:*

a.

b.

Data verifying the resource;

Resource adequacy verifying estimated cash flows;

Project development and management risk;

Field development plan and budget proposed by the developer; and

Minimum resource criteria which eventually result in conversion of construction
loan into a longer-term project loan.

THE LEGISLATIVE CONTEXT

The Geothermal Resources Act (the “GRA”)*® is “[a]n Act of Parliament to control the

exploitation and use of geothermal resources and vest the resources in the Government

The First Schedule to the Regulations was a Model Geothermal Resources Licence. The
terms of the Model Licence and of the Licence as issued are not the same (for example the
“in and under the land” wording in Clause 1(1) of the Licence does not appear in clause
1(1) of the Model Licence though it does appear in the forfeiture clause (clause 6(1)(a)) of
the Model Licence) but the Tribunal does not consider that anything turns on those

differences, the issues arising falling for determination by reference to the terms of the

Licence as granted.

wm The Licence* and Authority to Explore
The Licence was granted on 5 September 2007 by the Minister for Energy, the Hon Kiraitu
Murungi EGH MP (the “Minister” or the “MOE”).*”
It stated:
1. The licensee is hereby granted the following exclusive rights:

(1) The right and privileges to enter, explore, drill for and extract,
produce, utilize and dispose geothermal steam and associated
geothermal resources in and under the land specified in the
Appendix I ) and shown on the map set forth in Appendix II hereof
(the ‘License Area’).

46

(2) In so far as it may be necessary for and in connection with the
said operations, the exclusive rights to -

(a) drill and construct all necessary boreholes;

(b) erect, construct and maintain houses and buildings for the
licensee’s own use and for the use by the licensee’s employees;

(c) erect, construct and maintain plant, machinery, buildings and
other erections as may be necessary;

(d) utilize the geothermal resources;
(e) subject to the Water Act, reclaim and utilize any water; and

(f) construct and maintain roads and other means of communication
and conveniences.

(3) The exclusive right to take and use or apply the geothermal
resources for the purpose of generating electric power. Power
Purchase Agreement (‘the geothermal contract’) to be entered into
between the licensee and the government.

2. The rights granted shall be for a term of thirty years from the date
hereof and such term may be renewed at the option of the licensee,
for two further period of five years each; provided the licensee has
complied with all the terms hereof.

4. The licensee shall comply with the provision of the Geothermal
Resources Regulations, 1990 and drilling conditions as specified in
the Second Schedule thereto.

7. (1) The Minister may, by notice to the licensee, declare this
license to be forfeited

(a) if the licensee wholly ceases work in or under the license area
during a continuous period of six months, without the written
consent of the Minister;

(b) if the licensee commits a breach or is in default of any provision
of the Geothermal Resources Act or of the Geothermal Resources
Regulations, 1990 or of any terms or conditions of the license and
the Minister has caused a notice to be served on the licensee
requiring the licensee -

47

(i) in case of a breach which, in the opinion of the Minister, is
capable of being repaired or made good, to repair or make good the
breach within a specified period;

(ii) in the case of a breach which, in the opinion of the Minister, is
not capable of being repaired or made good, to show cause why this
license should not be forfeited.

(2) The forfeiture of this license under paragraph (1) shall not affect
any liability already incurred by the licensee.

9. The licensee shall provide the Minister with periodic
written reports of the progress of operations under this license
as follows-

(1) on drilling operations, daily;

(2) on production operations, daily;

(3) on geophysical operations, monthly;
(4) on geothermal operations -

(a) within one month of the last day of March, June, September and
December covering the previous three months;

(b) within three months of the date of expiry or surrender of this
license.

(5) Each report under paragraph (4) shall contain, in respect of the
period which it covers-

(a) details of the geothermal operations carried out and the factual
information obtained;
(b) a description of the area in which the licensee has operated;

(c) an account of the licensee’s expenditure on geothermal
operations;

(d) a map indicating all bores and other geothermal operations.*
184. The combined effect of Regulation 3(2) and Clause 1(3) of the Licence show that there

would have to be a PPA pursuant to which the licensee would supply power. Accordingly

58 Clause 19 of the Licence contained the dispute resolution provisions which have been the subject of consideration
in the Tribunal’s Decision on Preliminary Objections.

48

WalAm’s and Kenya’s understanding would have been from the outset that in accordance
with the statutory and regulatory regime a PPA would have to be negotiated and agreed
with the relevant entity (KPLC) to enable the Licensee to exploit its rights under the

Licence.

185. WalAm was granted an Authority to Explore for Geothermal Resources by letter dated
3 September 2007 but signed by the Minister on 5 September 2007 (the “Authority to
Explore”),*® the same date as the Licence. The Authority to Explore was granted pursuant
to Section 6(1) of the GRA. The recitals recorded that WalAm had applied for the grant of
authority to explore for geothermal resources in Suswa and that the government wished to
promote and encourage the development of geothermal resources in the area.

186. Section 1.0 of the Authority to Explore granted WalAm authority “to make surveys,
investigations, tests and measurements in search of geothermal resources” in the specified

area and for that purpose authorised WalAm to:

(a) Enter upon the Specified Area with such assistants, gear,
appliances, and equipment as it deems fit for the objects of the
Authority;

(b) Sink any bore within the Specified Area;

(c) Make geological surveys and geophysical surveys within the
Specified

Area; and

(d) Generally do all things necessary in connection with the objects
of the Authority.

187. Section 3.0 of the Authority to Explore stated:
3.0 WORK OBLIGATION

The company will carry out a two phased exploration programme
as follows:

THE FACTS

THE GRANT OF THE LICENCE AND THE AUTHORITY TO EXPLORE

The legislative context suggests that the usual sequence of events would be an application
for and the grant of an authority to explore (see Section 6 of the GRA) followed in due
course by an application for and grant of a licence (see Section 7 of the GRA). The
distinction is reflected also in the Regulations, with the content of an application for an
authority under Section 6 of the GRA set out in Regulation 2, and the content of an
application for a licence under Section 7 of the GRA set out in Regulation 4. What appears
to be contemplated is that the information obtained from and results of exploration carried
out pursuant to an authority to explore would be used as a basis for the application for the
grant of a licence. Hence, for example, Regulation 4(1)(e) requiring the application to
specify “a general statement of the proposed programme of exploration of the geothermal
resources, including a comprehensive report on the location, nature and characteristics of

the source of geothermal energy to be explored”.

That sequence did not happen in this case. WalAm made an “Application for Geothermal
Exploration Authority as per Kenya Geothermal Act 1982” by letter to the Minister of
Energy dated 20 July 2007. That letter gave various particulars concerning WalAm, its

directors, and beneficial ownership. It stated:

5) Work Program: As per work program and expenditures attached.

It also stated as to financing that:

6) Financing: The initial exploration will be funded by private
equity provided by directors and business associates of the directord

[sic] up to item # 6 on the work program i.e. up to completion of
project feasibility.

Subsequently, based on the report, further exploration drilling funds
will be raised in public market with a listing on the US
Nasdaq.BB.exchange.

It also stated:

7) Technical Capability: The directors of the corporation have over
100 years of combined business, geological and power engineering
experience.

Specialized services will be provided by external consultants such
as Geothermex, Power Engineers Inc and Identified Power Partner.

8) Conditions:
1) Period of Exploration Authority 5 years as per Geothermal
Resources Act.

2) Geothermal Resources Authority will specify clause 2(3) of the
Geothermal Resources Act, 1982

3) Mutually agreeable Memorandum of Understand [sic] for Power
Purchase Agreement before exploration drilling commences. The
tarrifs [sic] would be based on after tax I.R.R. of 18.5%

4) The Government of Kenya to provide access road for
transportation of equipment up to the drilling site.

5) The Ministry of Energy will second required technical personnel
to assist with exploration.

194. WalAm acknowledged receipt and accepted the terms of that letter by letter dated 2 August

2007, stating in relevant part “[t]hank you for your letter of July 31, 2007. All the terms

set out in this letter are gratefully accepted.”

195. The Authority to Explore and the Licence were then issued as described above.

196. The following should be noted about these exchanges:

a.

c.

WalAm’s letter of 20 July 2007® applied for a “Geothermal Resources Authority
for Suswa”. That description and the terms of the application show that what was
being sought was an authority to search and explore pursuant to Section 6 of the

GRA. That appears from:

i. The heading of the document as being an “Application for Geothermal

Resources Authority for Suswa”; and

ii. The proposed conditions which refer to “Exploration Authority” and the Work

Program which consisted of exploration activities.
The Authority to Explore granted was a Section 6 of the GRA authority to explore:

i. The terms of the Authority to Explore itself refer to the fact that “WalAm has
applied for the grant of Authority to explore” which must be a reference to the

letter of 20 July 2007, though not expressly identified.

ii. The Minister expressly granted the Authority to Explore pursuant to Section

6(1) of the GRA.

There was no document that purported to be an application for a licence. The letter

dated 20 July 2007 was in terms an application for an authority. The legal

54

significance of there being no application for a licence is discussed below in Section

VILB. The Respondent contends that this invalidates the Licence.

Mr Walji’s evidence was that he had submitted a letter of interest on behalf of
WalAm for licences to explore and develop two different geothermal concessions
in February 2007 and that in response the Ministry of Energy had indicated that
those concessions were not available but that “it would grant WalAm the rights to
Suswa”.®’ In cross-examination Mr Walji said that he had had an indication and

encouragement to that effect.”

By the Authority to Explore, the Minister accepted WalAm’s proposed Work
Program which had been attached to the application letter. Section 3.0 of the
Authority to Explore required WalAm to carry out the two phased exploration
programme that WalAm had proposed. The Authority to Explore records that
exploration programme including WalAm’s costings of a minimum of US$250,000

for phase 1 and US$8,250,000 for phase 2.

The Work Program proposed consisted of two parts — studies (including MT and
TEM soundings which Mr Walji described as being geophysical studies®*) the cost
of which was estimated to be US$250,000 to be followed by the drilling of two
exploration wells, analysis of results and then “Decision to proceed with
Development program and apply for Geothermal Resources License in accordance
with the GRA to undertake development” (with a total estimated cost for the whole
program of US$8,250,000). Thus, the proposed Work Program attached to the
application for an Authority itself appears to have contemplated a subsequent

application for a licence.

The Tribunal considers that the proposed Work Program was effectively approved and

accepted by the terms of the Authority to Explore — indeed the language of the Authority

to Explore is in mandatory terms under the heading “Work Obligation”: “[t]he company

will carry out a two phased exploration programme as follows: ...”

The application for an authority had stated that initial exploration would be funded by
private equity provided by directors and business associates of the directors up to
completion of project feasibility — that according to the work program would include the
drilling of exploration wells, in other words suggesting that the “private equity” funding

would extend to the US$8.25 million costs including the exploration well drilling.”

The Tribunal notes also that the “conditions” stated in the application referred to a
“(mutually agreeable Memorandum of Understand [sic] for Power Purchase Agreement
before exploration drilling commences. The tarrifs [sic] would be based on after tax ILR.R.
of 18.5%”. Such a memorandum of understanding would have been different from a fully
negotiated Power Purchase Agreement (“PPA”).” It is unlikely that at this stage it was

contemplated that a binding PPA could have been concluded prior to exploration drilling.

In any event the issuance of the Authority to Explore by the Minister was not made on the

basis of any acceptance or indeed any reference to the “conditions” in the application.

It is not clear therefore how and why a Licence came to be issued at the same time as the
Authority to Explore in response, apparently, to the application for an Authority. However
Mr Nyoike’s evidence was that he had been “asked by Minister Murungi to facilitate
issuance of the geothermal resources authority and licence for WalAm in accordance with
the Geothermal Resources Act and the National Energy Policy”,” that he did so, that he
considered that it had been done in accordance with the GRA and that the Minister had
himself decided that they should be issued with the benefit of whatever information he

thought was important to make that decision.” The Minister had considered the application

to be for a licence.”* Mr Nyoike said that he had reviewed WalAm’s application to ensure
that it complied with the GRA. He had understood from the “Conditions” that WalAm
wanted a memorandum of understanding for Power Purchase Agreement, but that condition

was not agreed.”

On the basis of the evidence the Tribunal finds that as a matter of fact WalAm wished to
obtain both a Section 6(1) GRA authority to explore and a licence in respect of Suswa and
that the Minister granted the Authority to Explore and the Licence respectively pursuant to
Sections 6 and 7 of the GRA, considering (on the advice of the Permanent Secretary)

WalAm to have complied in all respects with the GRA for those purposes.

The Tribunal finds that WalAm proposed a work program of exploration, including

minimum costings which the Minister accepted in granting the Authority to Explore.

‘WALAM’S FINANCIAL POSITION AT THE TIME OF THE GRANT OF THE LICENCE AND
AUTHORITY TO EXPLORE

Mr Walji’s evidence was that WalAm did not have US$8 million or anything like that at
the time of the application for the Authority to Explore and grant of the Authority to
Explore and Licence or indeed at any time up to November 2012. As Mr Walji said,
“[t]he intent was to raise that capital.””* Indeed the evidence suggests that WalAm was
financially stretched from the start even to cover the initial first phase expenditure that was
estimated in its proposed Work Program to cost US$250,000.77 WalAm’s financial

‘WALAM’S ASPIRATIONS FOR A PPA AS AT THE TIME OF OBTAINING THE LICENCE

While WalAm did not have in place funding or commitments to fund the exploration
program that it proposed as part of its application for an authority to explore, it is apparent
that it considered that it would have to raise private equity capital to do so from its directors
and associates, and that some form of commitment in relation to its ability to obtain a Power
Purchase Agreement would be needed to help raise finance. The reference to a
“Memorandum of Understand[ing] for Power Purchase Agreement before exploration
drilling commences” in condition 3 of the application shows that WalAm appreciated that
it would not be able to get a PPA before exploration drilling had taken place — indeed the
Work Program suggested that “analysis of results and delineation of resource” would be

needed based on the results of the two proposed exploration wells.

Though Mr Walji had been advised by Mr Fred Mbatau (a former Principal Geologist in
the Ministry of Energy”) at the time of the application in 2007, Mr Walji did not have a
good understanding of what would be required in order to negotiate and conclude a PPA
or indeed of whether he could assume that any kind of commitment sufficient to support a
fundraise would be obtained without drilling of some kind having taken place. He did
however know that WalAm could not get a PPA at least until the results of drilling two
exploration wells had been obtained successfully and analysed. That is demonstrated by
the Work Program which showed that he contemplated that exploration wells at least would
be necessary and also by the condition (3) which he sought to attach that there would be a
mutually agreeable memorandum of understanding for a PPA before exploration drilling
commences. Mr Walji confirmed in evidence that the conclusion of a mutually agreeable
memorandum of understanding for a PPA and the conclusion of a PPA were not the same

thing.”

WalAm may, by the reference to a memorandum of understanding for a PPA in the

conditions in its application, have been trying to obtain some commitment from the

Murungi.

Minister or even just to mark that it would need some form of confirmation that it would
get a PPA for fundraising purposes.*’ It is important to note that WalAm did not obtain
any comfort from the Minister in that regard at that time. The Authority to Explore
specifically included the Work Program proposed by WalAm as an obligation on the
company as part of the giving of the authority to explore but did not accept the conditions
that WalAm had proposed in its application. Mr Nyoike’s evidence was that they had been
“removed’,*! in other words deliberately not included in the Authority to Explore when the
terms of the Work Program proposed by WalAm were set out. Mr Walji’s evidence was
that he noticed that when he received the Authority.*? This is important because WalAm
accepted the Authority to Explore without demur as to its terms and there was no indication
given by WalAm to the Minister that it might not be able to fulfil the obligations which the
Authority to Explore set out, in according with WalAm’s own proposal. Moreover,
Mr Nyoike specifically asked Mr Walji before the Licence was granted whether WalAm
“was capable of seeing it through and whether he could manage to deliver according to its

terms and he confirmed that WalAm was capable of doing so.”**

208. The Licence was clear that geothermal resources taken by the licensee could only be used
for the purpose of generating electric power supplied pursuant to a Power Purchase

Agreement.** Mr Walji’s letter of 2 August 2007* on behalf of WalAm accepted the

8 There is no doubt that some evidence of commitment to being able to obtain a PPA would have been important to
WalAm’s attempts to raise finance. There was some evidence that for a major external equity finance raise it could
be critical to have a PPA in place. See Transcript D3:P728:L8-15 (Bloomquist cross-examination). But as
Mr Johnson explained high risk capital or somebody who was willing to come in early and take the risk would not
require a PPA to be in place though it would be good to have one. To obtain equity finance that was not such early
high risk capital you would probably want a signed PPA. See Johnson’s response to Arbitrator Spigelman question:

824. The Ministry of Energy took my application, and transferred the same Work Program, et cetera, into the License.
Q. Did you notice that the condition that you had put in your application is not reflected in the Authority? A. Yes, I
noticed that, but this was issued according to Geothermal Act of Kenya.” Transcript D2:P373:L5-12 (Walji cross-
examination).

83 Nyoike Witness Statement, P15. Mr Nyoike explained why, in view of previous poor experience with companies
who had not had the financial muscle to meet their obligations, he had raised that question with Mr Walji, when he
realised that WalAm was “just a minnow”. Transcript D3:P909-912 (Nyoike Tribunal’s questions).

84 [C-003]/KE-1], Geothermal Resources Licence No. 1/2007, 5 September 2007, Clause 1(3). There is a separate
legal issue as to whether that clause imposed any obligation on Kenya in relation to the concluding of a PPA.

Licence on its terms, again without demur: “[a]// the terms set out in [the Minister’s letter

of 31 July 2007] are gratefully accepted.” WalAm could have rejected (but did not) the

terms of the Authority to Explore or could have sought only to explore pursuant to the

Authority to Explore and not accepted the Licence. It accepted both, knowing that it did

not have any commitment or conditionality from Kenya in relation to a PPA, indeed that

its proposed condition had been rejected in that regard.

The Tribunal accordingly finds that as of the date of the Authority to Explore and Licence:

a.

WalAm did not have the financial resources to carry out the Work Program to
which it committed by its application for and acceptance of the Authority to

Explore.

While the Licence envisaged the conclusion of a PPA (and indeed that was also
contemplated and required by the statutory and regulatory regime and understood
by the parties) WalAm understood at least that it could not negotiate and obtain a
PPA before the results of drilling two exploration wells were obtained. It hoped to
raise the modest costs of a feasibility study and exploration program (estimated at
US$250,000) which would determine the best locations for exploration wells and
the more substantial finance needed to drill two exploration wells (estimated at an
additional US$8 million) from “private equity provided by directors and business

associates”.

WalAm did not accordingly expect that it would have a PPA before commencing
some kind of exploration drilling, let alone make obtaining a PPA a condition of

proceeding with such work on the land.

WalAm wanted to obtain some kind of evidence of Kenya’s intent to give a PPA in
the form of a memorandum of understanding, which may have helped with
obtaining finance, but WalAm’s attempt to make that a condition of the grant of the
Authority to Explore was rejected by the Minister and in any event Mr Walji
understood that any such memorandum of understanding would not be the same as
obtaining a PPA and that a PPA could not be concluded until after results from

exploration wells have been obtained.

60

e. Kenya had not made any promise to WalAm as regards either the conclusion or the
timing of a PPA in relation to exploration and the Work Program that WalAm had
committed to undertake. WalAm did not believe that Kenya had made any such
promise — indeed Mr Walji had noted from the Minister’s response to WalAm’s
application that the proposed conditions even in relation to a memorandum of

understanding had not been accepted.

SEPTEMBER 2007 — NOVEMBER 2008

Following the grant of the Licence, WalAm asked for information including surveys and
data relating to the Suswa area. By letter dated 24 September 2007 Mr Nyoike requested
KenGen to provide that information to WalAm.*° In a letter dated 7 February 2008 from
Mr Walji to the Minister (copied to Mr Nyoike),*” Mr Walji complained that KenGen was
holding back from providing data. There had been a three-month delay in submission of
information to WalAm which had been directed to be provided by the Ministry. Mr Walji
also reported generally in that letter on the progress WalAm had made “to fulfill the
company’s obligation of the Geothermal Authority/License granted to the company.” It is

to be noted from that letter that:

a. Mr Walji’s terminology recognised that the “Authority/License” did impose
obligations on WalAm though what he understood those to be was not at this stage
clear. His letter concluded by saying “[p]lease be assured that I will stick with my

commitment and contractual obligations”.

db. Little progress had been made by WalAm in terms of fundraising. Mr Walji said
that “seed capital” had been “committed by private investors and myself’. The

amounts and identity of the investors were not stated.

Mr Walji states in that letter that approaches had been made to ten geothermal consulting

firms, of whom four had responded with the intent that a contract would be awarded to “the

most qualified firm of our choice to complete the first phase of Suswa exploration”. The
reference to “first phase” was to the first phase of the Work Program, in other words

feasibility studies, survey work etc. all before and with a view to exploratory drilling.

There was no indication in the progress report of anything being done by WalAm in Kenya
other than a reference to Mr Mbatau being the contact person and operations manager who

was authorised to collect data from KenGen.

On 10 December 2007, WalAm had issued a Request for Proposal to GeothermEx to
provide evaluations and advice on the Suswa project, and overall feasibility of developing
geothermal power from the concession;** eventually GeothermEx was selected as their
consultant and retained to prepare a report including making recommendations as to how

to proceed and develop the project.”

On 6 August 2008, GeothermEx emailed a signed proposal for a feasibility evaluation of
the Suswa project.” It set out the proposed scope of work, with a budget not to exceed
US$90,000 and a timeline of about 3 months after receipt of necessary documents. The
proposal itself is dated 15 January 2008. This raises questions as to why there was an
almost eight-month delay in the submission by GeothermEx to WalAm of this proposal.
The Tribunal notes that the cover email stated “[w]e acknowledge receipt of and express
appreciation for the prepayment check.”°®' Mr Walji had only signed the proposal on
21 July 2008.’ There is a question as to whether engagement of GeothermEx and the
delayed signing of the proposal was occasioned by WalAm’s late payment of the deposit

necessary to ask GeothermEx to initiate work (which was $30,000). °°

According to a further progress report letter from Mr Walji to Mr Nyoike dated 5 November
2008" WalAm had:

a. Obtained all the available data by June 2008;

db. Retained GeothermEx in July 2008 to prepare a “Prospect Evaluation Report” ata

cost of US$90,000 and received an interim report in October; and
c. Planned a field trip for GeothermEx and WalAm personnel for 18 November 2008.

Mr Laing of WalAm and Mr Granados, GeothermEx’s Drilling Manager made that site
visit in November 2008. As appears from the detailed GeothermEx’s Feasibility Report of
March 2009% that visit was “to evaluate site logistics and infrastructure, and to assess the
availability and possible sources of water for drilling.”. A WalAm Annual Report records
that during this visit meetings were held in Nairobi with Mr Nyoike, MOE Chief Geologist,
John Omenge and other MOE staff**; MOE staff were invited to a field visit of the Olkaria
area. A field visit was conducted to KenGen offices in Olkaria to introduce GeothermEx
personnel to KenGen and have discussions of drilling issues and drilling experiences
KenGen had had in the course of drilling the Olkaria geothermal wells. Field visits also
included Olkaria IV drilling sites with a rig tour provided by Great Wall Drilling, as well
as to the Suswa caldera and surrounding area where two representatives of the local Maasai
were also met. Issues identified from those meetings included water availability, the
necessity for road upgrades and the need for a separate civil engineering and logistics study

to address water and road issues.

217. The GeothermEx report covered analysis of exploration data, estimation of recoverable
geothermal energy reserves, well productivity considerations, site evaluation, well design

and cost estimate, and (at a very high level) development costs.°”

218. There is also evidence that in this period individuals including former directors of WalAm
with whom Mr Walji was communicating with a view to increasing their investments
expressed unwillingness to put in any more by way of equity investment than they had

already and that such amounts were in any event very modest.°*

E. FEBRUARY TO SEPTEMBER 2009 — MARCH MEETINGS AND PRESENTATIONS, POsT-
MEETING CORRESPONDENCE

219. On 13 February 2009 Mr Walji emailed Mr Nyoike, attaching a letter dated 11 February
2009 to the Minister. By that letter WalAm informed the Minister that it had “completed
the exploration of Suswa Geothermal Prospect and Pre-feasibility to the company’s
satisfaction.” It was proposed that they should proceed “with the Geothermal License

rights and initially drill up to five (5) exploration wells”. He then stated that:

In this regard we would like to avail ourselves to the Government
Kenya during the week of March 2, 2009 and attend to the following:

- Present to yourself the progress report and exploration program
findings for Suswa Exploration Field.

- Further discern Kenya Power needs and Government of Kenya
move forward position.

- Present up to five (5) well drilling program and Suswa Field
Development Plan.

- Present Suswa Geothermal Project costs and Economics.

that the costs they indicated were “approximations only” and would need a power plant engineering firm to provide
better supported costs estimates for the costs of power plant construction, operation and maintenance. (p. 7-2 of the
Report).

- Discuss Power Purchase Agreement ‘PPA’ terms to provide

220. GeothermEx’s report was dated March 2009.' It describes their retainer as being “to
assist in determining the feasibility of developing the geothermal resources at Suswa’”. The
report gave some assessment of reserves but of “an admittedly broad range”, namely from
20 to more than 800 MW. The report indicated “[a] minimum (90% probable) value of
about 75 MW is estimated.” It suggested that the most likely or modal value was nearly
200 MW for a project life of 30 years and stated:

Drilling and testing of productive wells is required to prove that
these reserves can be utilized for a commercial power project.'"'

but further concluded that:

Further no additional geophysical survey data is recommended;
instead the project can proceed directly to drilling full-diameter
wells. '°
221. As the discussion in the report explained, the recommendation that the project could
proceed directly to drilling full diameter wells would be “to confirm the resource”! and
that “[d]rilling and testing of commercially productive wells is required to prove that these

reserves can be utilized, increasing the reliability of the reserve estimate.” '

and meaning of these recommendations. He explained that whilst GeothermEx had been able to make the
recommendation to proceed directly to drill full diameter wells, the precise productivity and the costings involved
would not be known until particular wells had been drilled. GeothermEx had given a very wide range of estimate
of productivity from 3MW to 12 MW. Sce generally his evidence at Transcript D4:P1197-1243 (Sanyal cross-
examination).

The report gave estimated costs for different size projects with drilling costs ranging from
US$42 million (for a 20 MW project) to US$140 million (for a 75MW project) and total
development costs ranging from US$96 million to US$312.5 million.

The very specific reference in Mr Walji’s letter to the Minister dated 11 February 2009!
(copied to Mr Nyoike) to a program for drilling up to five wells would suggest that
Mr Walji must have had the GeothermEx report (or at least a final draft of it) prior to

writing his letter.

In that letter Mr Walji had also proposed two weeks of meetings with the Minister and
various Kenyan stakeholders including KPLC, and KERC. It suggested that a three-hour
meeting would “[c]. e PPA terms discussion and project commencement plan” and
that a final meeting of suggested time of four hours would “[c]onclude Government of
Kenya and WalAm intent” .'°

Meetings did take place with WalAm representatives in March 2009. The
contemporaneous evidence in relation to those meetings as to dates and the contents of the
discussions is not in all respects clear and consistent. However, as concluded by the
Tribunal below, the essential matters relevant to the issues which the Tribunal has to decide
can be clearly discerned. In particular, the correspondence through the remainder of 2009
is important both in establishing the positions taken by the various parties at the March
meetings and subsequently. The Tribunal received witness evidence in particular from
Mr Walji, Mr Laing and Mr Nyoike in relation to those meetings but takes the view that
the contemporaneous record is in material respects likely to be more reliable and that oral
evidence of meetings which took place more than eight years before the evidence being
given must be considered with care and some caution, despite the well-intentioned efforts

of all the witnesses to assist the Tribunal.

WalAm’s evidence is that Mr Walji and Mr Laing met with and made presentations to the
Ministry of Energy and KPLC'” and that WalAm emphasised that the next step was
drilling, that drilling required funding and that funding required a PPA. This account is
supported by Mr Walji’s subsequent letter to the Minister, dated 15 June 2009, and which
is referenced below.'* The presentation which WalAm says was made on 20 March
described GeothermEx’s recommendations as follows at slide 17:'°

— Proceed to drilling full diameter wells to complete feasibility stage
... Project becomes feasible after two successful wells are completed

and then stated at slide 19 that there was a need to drill a minimum of three wells at a cost
of US$23.5 million to prove feasibility, at slide 25 that there was a need to attract Risk
Capital and, at slide 29 that:

Capitalization requires Power Purchase Agreement

— WalAm will raise equity capital on the strength of the PPA ...

— Minimum funding required for (10 MW) 3 well program $23.5m

— Minimum funding required for (20 MW) 6 well program $44m.
And at slide 31 that:

WalAm will undertake to raise the capital under the following terms:
— Mutually agreed PPA

— Cooperation from Ministry of Energy, KPLC, Energy Regulatory
Commission, Ministry of Land and Water

— Government of Kenya to take responsibility to facilitate the project

A later letter dated 15 June 2009!" from Mr Walji to the Minister stated that he and
Mr Laing visited Kenya from 17 March to 15 April 2009 and that:

a. Ministry of Energy personnel had been briefed on 20 March 2009;

db. Some progress was achieved however not to the extent expected due to
unavailability of Ministry of Energy and KPLC personnel as scheduled and
confirmed in the letter from the MOE dated 25 February 2009. The letter (at
paragraph 6) expressed frustration at “the delays and lack of motivation in Kenya.”
He further requested the Minister to “use his good offices to expedite the process”
(at paragraph 10) of submission of information from KPLC and Government of
Kenya (presumably the Ministry) to enable the process of RFPs for well design and

the preliminary Suswa Geothermal Development Plan to move forward;

c. A follow-up meeting had been held on 9 April 2009 to deal with project economics,
power tariffs and the terms of a PPA, a meeting said to have been conducted by

Mr Njoroge (of KPLC); and

d. A meeting had been held with Mr Omenge, the Chief Geologist, on 27 March 2009
at which questions had been addressed to Mr Omenge, some of which had been
answered at the meeting, and information was awaited by WalAm in relation to

others.

A document dated 27 March 2009'"' sheds some light on the discussions with Mr Omenge.
It appears that at the meeting with Mr Omenge on 27 March 2009, WalAm provided
Mr Omenge with a list of questions. The Ministry of Energy wrote to Mr Walji on
29 September 2009, attaching that document and responding to the requests for
clarification. In addition there is a version of this document with additions in red'!
(presumably prepared subsequently by Mr Walji) which Mr Walji said recorded
discussions at the meeting itself.''’ It would however appear from the version attached to
the Ministry of Energy’s letter of 29 September that the document given to the Ministry of
Energy in March included the statements under the heading “Drilling Rig” that “WalAm

expects to award the drilling contract prior to December 31, 2009 and to commence
drilling at Suswa before the end of 1° QTR 2010” and in the concluding paragraph that:

For WalAm to proceed at the planned place we do need quicker

responses from Kenya. With closer and more timely cooperation we

can complete the Environmental Impact Study, Suswa Development

Plan and Power Purchase Agreement and the drilling program

more effectively. We are still targeting the drilling program to

commence in the first quarter of 2010.
For completeness, there is another WalAm presentation probably of the same period though
its intended audience and precise timing is not clear'™ nor whether it was in fact used,
which stated at slide 15 that a minimum of 3 wells were required to prove feasibility at a
cost of US$23.5 million and that “Funding — PPA with adequate returns will attract

investment”.

Any discussion of a PPA with the Ministry of Energy would not have been appropriate for
the Chief Geologist. This would explain why, even in the version of the 27 March 2009
document!''’ which is said to record the discussions at the meeting, there is no discussion

ofa PPA.

Mr Nyoike, not Mr Omenge, wrote the Ministry’s response to this document by letter of

29 September 2009:''

a. Under the heading “General Discussion” in the 27 March 2009 document WalAm
had stated “[a]il of the challenges and issues below represent potential costs to the
Suswa project. All costs must be addressed in the final electricity rates. The lower
the costs, the lower the electricity rates.” Mr Nyoike responded in the letter of

29 September as follows:

Mr Ngatia, signed it on his behalf. Transcript D3:P875-876 (Nyoike cross-examination).

WalAm presented that the challenges and issues raised represent
potential costs on the Suswa prospect and that the costs must be
addressed in the final electricity costs. This is explained as follows:

It is expected that WalAm obtained the license to develop the Suswa
Geothermal Prospect on full understanding that the company has
the necessary financial and technical capability to fulfill the power
development.

The Ministry can_not therefore determine the project costs for
WalAm or engage in entering Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)
with WalAm unless steam wells have been drilled.'"’
db. In addition, Mr Nyoike added a section 6.0 in the letter addressing Power Purchase
Agreements (in between questions raised by WalAm on Project Coordination and

Transmission) stating:

6.0 Power Purchase Agreements (Ppa)

Whereas this Ministry endeavours to ensure geothermal projects are
developed to maximum steam production and utilization to capacity,
WalAm will need to drill at least three (3) geothermal wells which
will provide the required information on the capacity of power to be

generated and therefore making it possible to fruitfully negotiate for
PPA with Kenya Power and Lighting Company.'"*

c. It is also relevant to note that in response to WalAm’s question as to what financial

guarantees would be available, Mr Nyoike responded:

8.0 Financial Guarantees

WalAm will need to operate within the terms and conditions
specified in the Geothermal Resources Act, 1982 and the
Geothermal Resoruces [sic] Regulations, 1990 as no other
guarantees will be provided outside the stipulated policy, and legal
framework.
232. The Tribunal finds the following facts in relation to WalAm’s position as at March 2009

and the meetings in March 2009, and subsequent responses of Kenya:

'17 Emphasis added.
118 Emphasis added.

70

a. WalAm had obtained the GeothermEx recommendations that it was necessary to
drill wells in order to prove the productivity of the reserves. GeothermEx were
sufficiently confident of the reserves to be able to recommend that WalAm could
proceed to drill full-diameter wells without the need for exploration wells, but they
were not in a position to predict what the productivity of particular wells would be.
That would only become apparent once wells had been drilled and the range of

productivity predicted by GeothermEx was very broad.

db. Indeed as appears from WalAm’s letter of 14 April 2009 to Mr Njoroge, the CEO
of KPLC, following their meeting on 9 April, WalAm could not even say “whether
the Geothermal Resources exists in commercial quantity or not.”''? “To prove this
resource would entail drilling high cost exploration wells at cost of in excess of

$23 million initially to prove feasibility.”'”°

c. The estimated costs for drilling costs at the lower end of the range were
US$42 million. WalAm had estimated US$8 million for the exploration wells phase
of the Work Program submitted to and accepted by the Minister in applying for the
Authority to Explore.

d. WalAm did not have the finance available to undertake either exploration drilling

or full diameter well drilling of the kind recommended by GeothermEx. Nor did it

119 This letter is of evidential significance for other reasons. In it WalAm inaccurately predicted exploration costs. It
conflated economic, and legal issues and confirms that Mr Walji was not experienced in either, and did not appear
to have independent expertise to handle these issues. In his evidence Mr Walji stated that even the discussions at
the meeting with KPLC had been “[n]Jor quite a negotiation at that stage. It was just purely discussions leading to
@ memorandum of understanding.” Transcript D2:P539:L7-9. (Walji). He had not been in geothermal field
exploration before, the full impact of the GeothermEx report “sunk in more” and so “I might have used some wrong
terminology as I was learning”. Transcript D2:P540:L19-P541:L10 (Walji cross-examination). The reference in
the letter to the need to “consult our energy lawyer and our energy economist” in order to be able to respond to
KPLC’s positions is striking. Mr Walji said that these were references to a law firm, Heenan Blaikie, and an
economist, Tony Ranch, who would have been on the negotiating team if in due course WalAm had gone into face
to face negotiations with KPLC. Transcript D2:L539:L10-P540:L10 (Walji cross-examination).

have a prospect of raising those levels of investment from existing shareholders,

directors or business associates. '*!

e. Mr Walji considered that the only prospect of raising finance of the levels sufficient
to undertake drilling was if WalAm could obtain a PPA which he could use as a
basis for seeking to obtain substantial outside investment. The suggestion of a
memorandum of understanding preparatory to a PPA, as referred to in the

application for the Authority to Explore was not pursued. !”

f. In the meetings which Mr Walji and Mr Laing had in March 2009, probably in the
meeting with Ministry of Energy representatives around 20 March, but possibly
also in the meetings with KPLC and Mr Omenge, they raised the question of the
negotiation and conclusion of a PPA and did state (as the presentations show) that
obtaining a PPA was critical to their ability to raise the finance necessary to fund
drilling.'?* Nobody on Kenya’s side at that stage gave any positive response or
indication that a PPA could be given. At most KPLC indicated a willingness to take

forward discussions to indicate what the parameters would be for negotiations. '**

g. However a definitive response was given by Mr Nyoike in the 29 September 2009
letter. By that letter the Ministry of Energy expressly rejected WalAm’s suggestion

that a PPA should precede the obtaining of funding and capitalisation that would

"2 Mr Walji confirmed in cross-examination that WalAm did not have $8.25 million of private equity either at the
time of the application for an authority in 2007 or at any time up to November 2012. Transcript D2:P369-370
(Walji cross-examination). Indeed even in December 2011 WalAm was seeking to raise amounts of US$3 million
in order to cover expenses sufficient to enable negotiation and conclusion of a PPA. [R-038|/[KE-140], Emails
between Mr Maherab Walji (WalAm), Mr Lawrence Riungu, and others, 8 December 2011; Transcript D2:P380-
383 (Walji cross-examination). The contention that further financing could be raised from an eventual IPO is
preposterous at best, since the record is devoid of any information that could sustain the high threshold of due
diligence required in planning an IPO. Again, this points to the lack of expertise necessary for technical discussions.

122

As noted above, Mr Walji himself did not appear to regard his discussions with KPLC at this stage as other than
very preliminary and not as being active negotiations, because he did not have the necessary experts in either legal
or economic issues to assist him.

123 See also Walji First Witness Statement, P 16. In cross-examination Mr Walji said that he had verbally told the
Ministry that a PPA was a condition for exploratory drilling. Transcript D2:P397:L9-P398:L1 (Walji cross-
examination).

24 The detail of how the negotiations progressed with KPLC particularly in the period 2011 is considered below.

enable drilling to take place. WalAm was told in unequivocal terms that a PPA
could not be concluded until the results of drilling were known, that that would
require the drilling of three wells, and that the Licence had been granted on the
understanding that WalAm had the technical and financial capacity to fulfil the

project development.

Mr Walji understood the 29 September 2009 letter in those terms. He understood
that the Ministry of Energy was not accepting WalAm’s suggestion that a PPA
should be a precondition to drilling. Mr Laing did not recall whether he saw the
letter at the time but he recalled that Mr Walji had told him that the Ministry
expected WalAm to drill wells prior to a PPA." There was no subsequent
correspondence in which either Mr Nyoike changed his position or in which
WalAm disputed it and suggested that he was going back on some commitment

given at the March meetings.'°

For completeness, reference should be made to other communications in this period which

bear on WalAm’s and Kenya’s understanding of the position in relation to negotiations for

On 26 August 2009, Mr Fred Mbatau emailed Mr Walji to informing him of a discussion
he said he had had with the Minister regarding the PPA negotiations:!””

I personally went looking for the Minister today in his office to pass
your request that you are inviting him and his delegation to Canada
to conclude the PPA. He categorically told me he that he will not
be available. He wanted to know the problem. I briefed him on what
transpired with KPLC that they insisted on entering into a PPA of
75mgw instead of your proposed 20mgw.

He told me to let you know confidentially that he is ready to help
you personally enter into a 20mgw PPA with a condition to increase

to 75mgw or more in the future after drilling more wells apart from
the initial 6 you had proposed.

He also said he wants you to come and with his help conclude this
PPA...

235. Two days later, Mr Mbatau emailed Mr Walji'”’ saying in relevant part:
Thanks for your email and the information.'*

1. The Minister was very serious about his commitment ad [sic] he
even apologized for not meeting you when you were here. I propose
you take his word very seriously and do what he advised. By
proposing to see you before any further negotiations for the PPA
with KPLC it means he is serious. Note also that in Kenya it is very
rarely you get Minister’s replies only their PSCS or their juniors
who handle most of the correspondences.
236. A few days later, on 2 September 2009, in an email to the Ministry of Energy (which was
copied to Mr Nyoike, and Mr Njoroge, the Managing Director of KPLC),'*! Mr Walji

stated:
The attached brief (Appendix One)[{'**] outlines the steps required
to bring Walam’s Suswa Geothermal prospect to the drilling stage.
In order to complete the work required in as expeditious a manner

as possible, Walam will need the utmost cooperation from both the
Ministry of Energy and KPLC. ...

The steps are numerous but not so onerous that, together, we cannot
complete them in a timely manner in order that new electricity may
be delivered to the Kenyan grid by early 2012.

The brief is detailed however we can summarize the necessary steps
as:

2. Suswa Development Plan;

3. Power Purchase Agreement; and

4, Equity Financial Closure to commence the drilling in the first
quarter of 2010.

WalAm is continuing to proceed with development of the Suswa
Geothermal prospect. We are currently evaluating bids from
consulting firms for both the Development Plan and_ the
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and looking at the design
of the drilling program as well as rig availability.

The sooner we get a complete and not piecemeal reply to our letter
of 14" April 2009 and a response to the feedback requested from the
Ministry of Energy submitted in meetings in March 2009 to the Chief
Geologist, Mr. Omenge, the sooner we can commence with the
Suswa development as outlined below.'*

These are consistent with the line of communications referred to already:

a.

The emphasis by Mr Walji on WalAm’s need for a PPA to be able to obtain finance;

The emphasis on the need for negotiation of a PPA, and absence of any suggestion

that key terms had been agreed;

The absence of any suggestion that Kenya had agreed that WalAm need not

progress anything unless and until a PPA had been concluded; and

The absence of any suggestion that there was an original agreement by the Licence

or otherwise that a PPA was a precondition to performance of obligations in the

Licence.

‘WALAM’S POSITION IN RELATION TO THE PPA AFTER SEPTEMBER 2009

After September 2009, as discussed below, there were developments which show that it
was possible for there to be preliminary discussions and negotiations of a PPA. It is not
clear that conclusion of a PPA would have been impossible without the results of drilling.
(Separate considerations in relation to the detailed financial information necessary for
negotiation and WalAm’s financial resources to conduct such negotiation are considered
later.) The Tribunal does not consider that in itself to be significant. What is clear is that
at no point did Kenya either through the Minister of Energy or otherwise agree or accept
that WalAm did not have to proceed with drilling or other development work physically in
and under the land until a PPA had been concluded. As has already been noted WalAm
had been repeatedly stating that it needed a PPA and continued to do so. The consistency
of that repetition in the Tribunal’s view confirms the absence of any agreement or
acceptance by Kenya of the position that WalAm sought to establish, that it need not
comply with its obligations under the Authority to Explore and exploit the Licence until a
PPA was concluded. That repetition confirms also that WalAm knew and understood that
it had not obtained any such agreement. It is striking that the terms of WalAm’s statements
in relation to its need for a PPA did not refer to any alleged agreement with Kenya to that
effect, or any suggestion that it had obtained Ministerial waiver or suspension of the need

to comply with obligations it had assumed.

WalAm relies on evidence suggesting that the Minister was encouraging the conclusion of
a PPA. An email dated 28 October 2009'™ from Mr Fred Mbatau to Mr Walji reports a
meeting with the Minister in which Mr Mbatau says he told the Minister that WalAm
“require this PPA for security and that you are ready to start drilling early next year” and
the Minister is said to have stated that:

[H]e has already discussed the matter with both the PS [Mr Nyoike]

and Njoroge [KPLC] [presumably neither of whom were at the

meeting] and they have agreed the following ... 2. To ensure this

PPA is finalized quickly he proposed that you come the last week of

November from 23" November and finalize this PPA ... He wants
you to confirm this timing so that he can ensure KPLC and the

241.

242.

negotiating team is ready to finalize this matter to enable WalAm to

start drilling early next year.
Putting on one side questions as to the reliability and accuracy of this evidence, it does not
provide sufficient support for the position advanced by WalAm. Mr Mbatau does not say
that the Minister was asked to agree that WalAm need do nothing including any drilling
until a PPA was concluded. No reference is made to the Licence or the GRA. Nor was
this email followed by any letter from Mr Walji claiming such agreement, waiver or
suspension. That the Minister would have encouraged negotiations of a PPA with KPLC
to progress is not surprising (and would be consistent with the earlier communications from
Mr Mbatau referred to above and later correspondence specifically advising WalAm to do

so). That is not sufficient however to assist WalAm.

Indeed the next communication from WalAm to the Minister, Mr Walji’s letter of
14 January 2010,'* is inconsistent with Mr Walji having any such understanding. It refers
to meetings Mr Walji had in December 2009 and January 2010 including meetings with
Dr Simiyu of GDC at which a different arrangement was discussed under which WalAm
would develop Suswa in cooperation with GDC. Mr Walji asked for a detailed proposal in
relation to that idea (which would have been consistent with GDC’s mandate) to evaluate
it. Mr Walji concludes his letter by saying:

If arrangement cannot be concluded then WalAm will continue with

the exploration of the Suswa field and evaluate and explore the field

further as per Geothermal Resource Authority to Explore for

Geothermal Resources in the Suswa Prospect granted to WalAm

after the current dialogue with GDC id [sic] concluded. As you are

aware the obligations of Geothermal Authority have been fulfilled

to date and WalAm is in compliance. Any delays while we await

response from Kenya should not be construed as a delay by
WalAm.'*°

Importantly that letter was copied to Mr Nyoike.

2010.

136 Emboldened in original.

77

243. The Tribunal draws three points from this letter which become consistent themes over the

subsequent period of some 22 months before the forfeiture:

a. First, as already noted, there is nothing to suggest that Mr Walji considered that the
Ministry, either through the Minister or otherwise, had agreed or accepted that
WalAm need do nothing in or under the land, otherwise fulfil obligations under the
Licence or not perform obligations accepted as a condition of the grant of the

Authority to Explore until it had a PPA.

db. Second, and to the contrary, Mr Walji affirmed without qualification or reservation
the intention to proceed with exploration. Mr Walji’s reference to the Authority is
important because it was the Authority to Explore which contained the Work
Program commitment. That Work Program did not contain any conditionality in
relation to a PPA and assumed that WalAm would have the financial resources to
effect it. WalAm was thus confirming that it understood its obligations under the

GRA, Authority to Explore and Licence.

c. Third, Mr Walji’s statements of compliance and references to delay can be seen,
particularly in light of what follows, as betraying a consciousness on his part that
WalAm was delaying. It was obvious that WalAm had not done what it had said it
would do. In 2009 it had been saying it would start drilling in early 2010. It was
not in a position to do so and would not become so. The Tribunal considers that
Mr Walji’s assertions of compliance and complaints of delay showed a full
understanding on his part that WalAm was not able to comply and was delaying.

As became clear, that was increasingly a concern of the Ministry.
244. These themes can be seen again in Mr Walji’s next letter to the Minister of 30 August
2010.'57 Mr Walji wrote:

This correspondence is to provide you with an update of the
progress that has been made to date and to keep you informed as to

(WalAm) to Dr Silas M Simiyu (GDC) dated 31 March 2010, 30 August 2010.

78

how WalAm intends to lead the development of Suswa Geothermal
Field further.

Upon my return from Kenya and in order not to loose [sic] more
time, loose [sic] momentum and continue with progress WalAm had
achieved to date, we continued to work on various aspects of Suswa
Field Development as indicated below:

1. Continued working with Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM) on the
comprehensive Suswa Development Plan. [details were then set out
of the discussions with SKM and the expectation of a finalized report
by the end of the third week of September 2010]. Subsequently
WalAm’s technical team and I will attend to Kenya and provide you
with a comprehensive work program for Suswa Development.

2. While the work on the development plan was proceeding I
dispatched Sandy Laing, P.Geo,Chief Technical Officer, to Kenya
to complete the following tasks in order to keep moving the Suswa
project further.

a) We had previously put out an RFP for an Environmental Impact
Study and a SocioEconomic Study. Two Kenyan firms were short
listed and Mr. Laing conducted a face to face interview with each in
order to select the finalist. This was done.

b) To source out the availability of drilling rigs within Kenya. In this
regard Sandy worked with our Kenyan consultant Mr. Mark Jenkins
and Great Wall Drilling of China. They looked at the possibility of
moving the drilling rig from Isiolo to Suswa. Also looked at the
possibility of retaining the Crowkow rig which is being demobilized
from Uganda.

c) Investigate further the best approach for providing water for
drilling at Suswa. This information was needed to verify
assumptions in the Suswa development plan.

d) Worked with the Engineering firm of Howard Humphreys to
resolve some of the civil works challenges at Suswa and most
certainly try and arrive at the best approach for providing water for
drilling, staff and local residents. (Previously we had surveyed the
residents of Suswa and their main need was water thus we are
sensitive to that fact Suswa development plan should definitely take
this into account).

e) Generally work on logistics in which regard he worked with our
Kenyan consultant, Mr. Mark Jenkins.

79

Sf) Investigate the suitable office location and cost of rental for
budgeting purposes.

g) Meetings with the Ministry officials to have general discussions
regarding Suswa development. In this regard very productive
meetings were held with Chief Geologist Mr. John Omenge. His
input was very encouraging.

3) The company kept engaging the International investment
community and Institutions to promote the Suswa development with
positive results and the company kept up it’s [sic] public relations
work with the investors with an eye to their future participation in
future debt and equity.

Hon. Minister, it may seem that WalAm has not been doing much

work in Kenya due to perceived absence, however a lot of technical
work, planning, management aspect work, etc: has been done by

WalAm while other work was being done on behalf of WalAm by
SKM, Howard Humphreys, Mark Jenkins, Martin Mwangi and other
independent Consultants who WalAm has retained from time to time
for specific tasks. Most certainly late Mr. Fred Mbatau played an
important role in coordinating some of these activities, which will
now lead to WalAm being ready to drill as per schedule in the Suswa
Development Plan.

Honorable Mini. you will find the Suswa Devel Plan very
comprehensive dealing with various aspects of Suswa development
from_Envir l_ and Socio Economic Impact Studies right
through to Plant commissioning. This will be a road map for WalAm
to “Fast Track” the Suswa_ devel here_on_ forward.
Furthermore, this document will lend itself well to your Ministry and
K.P.L.C. to monitor the Suswa development and progress. You will
find that using WalAm’s approach will lead to faster development
of Suswa field, due to the comprehensive approach that the company
is taking using knowledge and technology; rather then [sic] reactive
and piece meal approach that is traditionally taken in exploration
and development of geothermal fields.

As soon as we finish an internal review of Suswa Development Plan,
which would take about 10 days after the receipt of the final
document from SKM, another ten days will be required to prepare
12 month Suswa work program for presentation ; subsequently we
will request an appointment date to present our work program for
Suswa prospect development Please anticipate this for late next
month.

Honorable Minister, we can confidently state that once you review
the final Suswa Development Plan, you will appreciate how much

80

attention to detail that WalAm has paid to Suswa, from Resource
Evaluation to Development. In fact, at your discretion you will be
proud to share Suswa Development Plan with the Kenya Cabinet
of Ministers and how WalAm will be able to commence
Development of Suswa well before the five year Exploration
Authority expires and without requesting additional 5 year
extension stipulated in the Kenya Geothermal Act.

Hon. Minister Murungi, we thank you for your time, patience and
support. Your sincerity in developing Geothermal Resources in
Kenya is recognized and we hope one day the people of Kenya will
thank you for it.

Yours truly,

[Signature]

245. The Tribunal notes the following from this important letter, consistent with the themes

identified above.

a. First the letter made no suggestion that the commencement of actual development

by drilling or other work on the land was conditional on or subject to a PPA.

db. Second, and consistent with the absence of any such condition, Mr Walji was
promising the Minister that WalAm would propose a final Suswa Development

Plan which would contain a comprehensive work program for development.

c. Third Mr Walji was clearly sensitive to the fact that there had been delay on
WalAm’s part (“it may seem that WalAm has not been doing much work in Kenya’)
and that what mattered in that regard was the commencement of drilling (“will now
lead to WalAm being ready to drill as per schedule in the Suswa Development
Plan”) (“This will be a road map for WalAm to ‘Fast Track’ the Suswa

Development here on forward”). Indeed, Mr Walji positively invited the Minister

248.

and KPLC “to monitor the Suswa development and progress” by reference to the

development plan that was to be submitted.

It is also to be noted that Mr Walji’s comments on financing suggested that no investors
had in fact been obtained (“with an eye to their future participation in future debt and
equity”).

For completeness the Tribunal notes that Mr Walji was asked in cross-examination why no
mention was made by him of any PPA conditionality. He said that “[PPA] requirement
had been made clear right at the onset. I didn’t see it necessary to mention that again and
sound impolite in my letter.”° The Tribunal does not accept that that was the reason.
Rather Mr Walji knew and understood that no such condition had been accepted and was,
in his letter (which was copied to Mr Nyoike), anxious to state that progress would now be
made to actual physical development by drilling in accordance with a program to be
submitted and, he hoped, approved, in circumstances where he knew that Kenya was
concerned about the lack of progress now almost three years after the grant of the Authority
to Explore and Licence. The references to the expiry of the Authority to Explore show
that, as always, Mr Walji was acutely aware of the statutory context of WalAm’s rights and

the obligations it had undertaken.
THE SKM DEVELOPMENT PLAN, WALAM’S 2011 WORK PROGRAM AND DISCUSSIONS
WITH THE MINISTRY IN MARCH 2011

The Development Plan was not ready by the third week of September. On 9 December
2010 Mr Walji wrote to the Minister'® to say that it had been received from SKM and that

During the next 10 days we will prepare and be ready to present to
you the following:

exploration.

2.Next 12 months of Work Program that WalAm Energy Inc will
undertake at Suswa.

3.A Comprehensive Suswa Development Plan which will take the
Suswa Geothermal field from Environmental Impact Study through
permitting, drilling exploration and development wells ultimately
leading to the commissioning of a 75 MWe power generation
facility: provided the geothermal resource at Suswa can support it.

The letter went on to propose a series of meetings starting with a 30 minute meeting with

the Minister to present a brief synopsis of those matters. Mr Walji then stated:

The same day or the next morning we would be prepared to present,
to your senior management and technical personnel from MOE and
KPLC, a more comprehensive and detailed technical overview of
the three topics mentioned above. Total time required will be
approximately 4 hours. Please note the Suswa Development Plan
report is approximately 150 pages including detailed project
timelines, costs and economics. With all due respect, this will be of
great interest to Mr. Nyoike P.S. at your Ministry, Mr. Njoroge CEO
of KPLC and Senior economists from both entities.

 

After our presentation, we anticipate that it will take the Kenyan
personnel approximately one week to complete their analysis and
submit their report to you. During this time. WalAm will begin
handling the numerous tasks required to get the Suswa project
moving forward. Establish and lease a permanent office in Nairobi.
award the contract for the Environnlental Impact Study preferably
to a selected Kenyan company, retain Kenya personnel in
permanent job positions, begin the permitting process for the
drilling program etc. Basically, following our road map for
sustainable, efficient .and successful power project development at
Suswa. This will be done with full transparency supported by
independent third party report is prepared by internationally
respected firms with expertise in Geothermal Systems Resource and
Engineering fields.

Approximately one week after we arrive in Nairobi, Mr. Thomas S.
Drolet, CEO of WalAm, along with the firm’s Chief Financial
Officer, would be prepared to join us for a further round of preset
appointments with Senior Personnel of MOE/KPLC to discuss the
terms of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Finalizing the terms
of the PPA is a prerequisite for the financial drawdown for drilling
of the exploration wells and further devel of the Suswa
project. This is dictated by financial markets and is a normal

83

international practice when high risk capital intensive exploration
drilling is undertaken.

The suggested series of meetings would be scheduled over a two
week period, our suggestion being as follows:

1. Presentation to Honourable Minister of Energy - 30 minutes

2. Presentation to MOE/KPLC personnel - 4 hours

3. One week break for MOE/KPLC personnel to review the Suswa
Development Plan Report and prepare their analysis and
recommendations to you. WalAm personnel available to answer any
inquiries.
4. WalAm CEO and CFO arrive in Nairobi. Maximum five working
days stay.

5. MOE/KPLC and WalAm discuss and finalize the PPA ‘terms’
through a series of meetings over next three to five days.'"

249. The Tribunal notes the terms of Mr Walji’s reference to the terms of the PPA being a
prerequisite for the financial drawdown for drilling. Mr Walji was not saying he had agreed
to such a precondition — on the contrary he prayed normal international practice and the
financial markets in aid of his position. His aspiration was clearly to have the Development

Plan and Work Program agreed at the same time as finalising the terms of a PPA.

250. It is not clear what, if any, version of an SKM report was sent to WalAm in November
2010. Version 1 is dated 8 February 2011.” It provided estimated costs for Phase 1
Exploration which included exploratory drilling, Phase 1 Production drilling and Initial
costs and Phase 2 Production Drilling costs for a 20MW project and a 55 MW project’?

characteristics that can only be inferred from the surface
exploration. This “resource proving” is of strategic importance to
the project for demonstrating to a very high level of confidence that
the resource is sufficiently large and of suitable quality such that
construction of a power plan is justified. ... It is anticipated that
conventional full-bore drilling (rather than slimhole drilling) will
be utilised to achieve the exploration and resource characterisation
objectives within the required timeframe. '*°

The drilling phase consists of three drilling stages (phase I —
exploration, phase I production and phase 2 production) ... Phase
1 (20MWe) — exploration drilling (initial 3 wells).'"

6.4.2 Drilling Preparations and Approval: Based on the results of
the exploration programme, a full specification for the well designs
and required materials should be prepared, and a detailed cost
estimate developed, based on tender prices. Drilling work involves
very considerable expense, and should be subject to formal approval
by WalAm and any funding partners. The approval decisions should
also involve a review of the overall viability of the entire project,
based on the firm cost information, if this is very different from
initial assumptions made. Total drilling expenditure is contingent
on success with initial wells: although not every well will be
successful, in general expenditure can be curtailed if the results of
previous wells are not sufficiently encouraging.'**

6.4.3 Drilling: .... Full bore exploration wells (as opposed to
slimholes) will confirm deep reservoir characteristics and confirm
the production capacity of the resource for commercial power
production. Based on GeothermEx’s recommendation, WalAm and

85

SKM have agreed that there should be an initial three development
wells and, dependent on the well productivity and temperature
results, a further three wells will be drilled during this first stage.'”

6.5.1. Engineering: At this early stage of the project, a conceptual
design and cost estimate for the power plant is used to inform
development plans and pre-feasibility analyses. This work is very
preliminary because little detailed information is available at this
stage, particularly in relation to fluid enthalpy and steam
conditions. '°

7.2. Approach

Implementation of the Suswa geothermal project requires that the
proposed development be demonstrated with sufficient confidence
to be technically and financially viable, with all necessary
regulatory approvals in place. In simple terms this requires the
following activities. Where work has already been undertaken in
these activities this is noted:

 

= Three exploration wells will be drilled to determine that the
geothermal resource is present and available to the project over
its life. Initial field exploration work has been done to provide
greater confidence in the available resource as verified by the
Suswa GeothermEx report.

= Demonstrate that the resource will be available over the long
term. This involves significant expenditure of both time and

funds on drilling and well testing. In turn, these activities require

specific infrastructure works and permits.

 

= Define the technical nature _and_cost of the proposed
develi This _involves ineering design, specification
and_tendering for the power plant, and also budgeting of
operating costs. Need to address all the related environmental
and social issues associated with the project, and obtain
required permits. Cost estimates have been made within an
accuracy range which will be improved in the coming months as
further work is undertaken to indicate well productivity and site
conditions.['>']

= Fully define the benefits of implementing the project including
sale of electricity and other tangible and intangible benefits.

productivity if wells had been drilled. Transcript D3:P682-683 (Laing cross-examination).

252.

This involves agreeing firm prices for the sale of electricity, and
quantifying carbon credits available to the project. On-going
discussions have taken place with Kenya Power regarding the
PPA. Parameters have been agreed regarding the required rate
of return to equity investors. The final PPA will be agreed prior
to financial close, when the project costs and performance can

be more reliably estimated.

= Confirm the financial viability of the project, demonstrating that
an adequate return will be earned on the required investment,
given the degree of risk involved. A detailed financial modelling
exercise has been undertaken and the required rate of return to
equity investors has been discussed with KPLC.

The project schedule shows all the key activities and their inter-

relationships. At this point the schedule is based on a number of

assumptions as well as experience from other projects. The schedule

will be regularly reviewed in the light of new and emerging

information, and adjusted as necessary as the project unfolds.'°?
For whatever reason and despite what Mr Walji had promised the Minister, WalAm did not
provide a Work Program to the Ministry until February 2011. There are various versions
of the 2011 Work Program in the record. It appears from a letter from Mr Walji to the
Minister dated 8 March 2011'% that a first version was presented in the first week of
February 2011 in relation to which the Ministry asked WalAm to add timelines and budget
allocations for each activity in the Work Program and for other clarifications. Nothing
turns on the differences between the versions because counsel for the parties agreed at the
evidential hearing that the version at Exhibit C-067/KE-41 was the version that had been

submitted following revisions to include timeliness and budgets.

Two particular matters of importance arise from the meetings and correspondence in

relation to the Work Program in February and March 2011:

a. First it is clear that these discussions took place in a context where WalAm was
made aware of the Minister’s dissatisfaction with the lack of progress of
development, the lack of work on the ground, and that the Licence was under threat

of forfeiture; and

'52 Emphasis added.

87

253.

254.

db. Second, WalAm did not try to condition the work to be done on the ground under
its Work Program on conclusion of a PPA and, though it clearly was looking to
obtain a term sheet for a PPA in short order, there was no linkage between the dates
of work to be done and the date when a PPA or term sheet would be agreed. More
importantly Mr Nyoike confirmed approval of the Work Program on the basis that
it would be strictly adhered to, and without reference to, indeed without referring

at all the status of PPA negotiations.

As to the first, the Tribunal has already noted that Mr Walji was alive to concerns on the
part of the Minister about delay because he had acknowledged and apologised for delay in
his letters in 2010. There had now been yet further delay with the Work Program being
proposed in February 2011 when it had been foreshadowed for September 2010. Mr Laing
said in his witness statement that “[iJn or around early 2011 Mr Nyoike threatened to take

‘4 Tn cross-

away WalAm’s License on the basis that it had not yet drilled a well”.
examination he said that Mr Walji had indicated in early 2011 that Mr Nyoike had said that

WalAm was under threat of having its Licence taken away.

There is support in the contemporaneous documents for finding that Mr Nyoike was indeed
exasperated by WalAm’s delays and in particular its failure to do “work on the ground”
and that this was communicated to WalAm in the context of the discussions about the work

program.

a. On 7 March 2011 Mr Nyoike wrote manuscript comments to the Chief Geologist
on a letter from WalAm seeking a waiver of VAT as follows: “[t]his is another
delaying tactic. It is not prudent to have WalAm sit on this area doing virtually
nothing”.'*> Mr Nyoike annotated comments to the Chief Geologist also on
7 March 2011 on a WalAm letter of 4 March saying: “[t]his is totally unacceptable.
Where is the legal opinion?”. He explained in his witness statement that with the

ongoing lack of work and progress at Suswa, the Ministry of Energy’s concern and

February 2011.

88

frustration grew due to the fact that “in Kenya’s 20 year rolling Least Cost
Development Power Plan geothermal power production was expected to be a major
source of electricity for sale to the national grid.”'** When he wrote his comments
to the Chief Geologist, he was frustrated with WalAm’s lack of progress at Suswa.
Three and half years had passed since the grant of the Licence and almost nothing
had been done to progress the project. The reference to a legal opinion was to the
obtaining of an opinion directed at whether WalAm had failed to comply with its

obligations under the Licence.

db. This frustration and specifically the complaint that WalAm had failed to do
anything at Suswa was undoubtedly communicated to Mr Walji at the meetings in
February 2011 and as appeared from Mr Laing’s evidence, Mr Walji understood

the concerns to give rise to the possibility of the Licence being forfeited.

c. There may be some linkage between this threat and what Mr Walji stated in his
letter to the Minister of 8 March 2011157 that at the 21 February 2011 meeting
Mr Nyoike had stated “that WalAm had not done enough ‘work on the ground”.
In that letter Mr Walji was alive to the problem of WalAm’s delay (“the Suswa
geothermal development project is running 15 months behind the timeline WalAm
had envisioned”) and that there was an issue about compliance with its obligations
(“Suffice it to say that WalAm Energy Inc is still fully in compliance with the Suswa
Geothermal Authority granted to the company and further the 2011 Work Program
presented to your Ministry in the first week of February 2011 keeps the company
in compliance”). Mr Walji said in evidence that during the meeting that had taken
place before he wrote his letter the feedback from the Ministry was criticism for
not having done enough work at Suswa.'** In his letter he had written that Mr
Nyoike had said that WalAm had not done enough “work on the ground” with that

phrase in inverted commas because those were exactly the words used by
156 Nyoike Witness Statement, Pp 22-23.

Mr Nyoike.'*? Mr Walji understood that Mr Nyoike was referring to physical work

at Suswa such as building roads, infrastructure and drilling.’

That accords with Mr Nyoike’s evidence as to what his concerns were. Mr Nyoike
explained in his evidence that his concerns about the lack of progress and work by
WalAm were not directed at drilling specifically. Before drilling could take place
there was work that needed to be done in the field — identification of sites for
drilling, civil works for accessing sites, access roads, and water was a critical
element that needed ground activities to get water to the sites for drilling.'*' In his
conversation with Mr Mugambi Gituru (see below) he told him that he had seen the
report on water supply options but on the ground there was nothing moving toward

provision of that water for drilling.’

The linkage between this discussion and the “in and under the ground” requirement
in the GRA is less clear in view of Mr Walji’s description in his letter of a
subsequent “clarification” obtained by Mr Mugambi Gituru from Mr Nyoike as to
what was meant by “work on the ground” and then the generation of a “Briefing
Document” which addressed 5 matters that WalAm said it was asked to address
(attached to the 8 March letter!®). There was extensive questioning in evidence
about this document, which did not include drilling or other work which might have
obviously been work of the kind contemplated by the GRA though, as referred to
above, Mr Nyoike had concerns about the absence of physical work on the ground

that would be a necessary prerequisite to drilling such as relating to roads and water.

The Tribunal does not consider it necessary or significant to resolve precisely who
raised which of these five elements. Mr Nyoike’s evidence was that Mr Mugambi

Gituru had contacted him to obtain clarification as to what he had meant by “work

on the ground” and that Mr Nyoike had made specific reference to clauses 7 and 9
of the Licence.’ He said that he had told Mr Mugambi “that they needed to be
doing some work in the field and then in addition to that, the reporting mechanism
was detailed in Clause 9.”'** He specifically referred to other matters such as roads

and water which would have entailed physical activity on the ground at Suswa.'°°

g. WalAm’s awareness that it had delayed, that the Ministry was concerned about lack
of progress of development and the threat of termination if progress was not made

are clear from WalAm’s own evidence and the contemporaneous documents.

255. As to the second important factual aspect of the February/March discussions, the Tribunal
finds that WalAm, in seeking and obtaining approval of the 2011 Work Program, assuaged
or at least deferred the concerns about lack of progress and activity by promising to carry
out a program which included (at item 6) a Geothermal Drilling Program of five wells in

the period April to December 2011 at an estimated cost of US$21 million.

This is therefore to confirm that approval of your work plan is
hereby granted, with the understanding that the schedule will be

(KPLC) for negotiations on a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) as

per the regulations.'*
The terms of Mr Nyoike’s letter were clear. Approval of the work plan set out in the body
of the letter was granted “with the understanding that the schedule will be strictly adhered
to”. The letter went on to advise WalAm to seek direct audience with the Managing
Director of KPLC to negotiate a PPA. There was no linkage or conditioning as between
the two. The work plan proposed by WalAm and approved by this letter provided for
“Infrastructure Development” including roads and water pipelines in the period February
to December 2011 and the drilling programme to commence in the period April to

December 2011 with a view to first well spud in December 2011.

The advice to WalAm to seek direct audience with KPLC to negotiate a PPA was consistent
with what Mr Shibuyanga described as the practice that the Ministry of Energy would issue
a letter which guided the developer and KPLC to commence negotiations of a PPA.’

Mr Nyoike’s letter was copied to Mr Njoroge, the Managing Director of KPLC.'”

WalAm may have regarded it as critical to obtain a PPA to be able then to raise the finance
necessary to start physical work (the workplan showed a budget of over US$15 million
even before getting to the drilling programme and another US$19.5 million for the drilling
programme) but the work plan proposed was not conditioned on obtaining a PPA first

though it emphasised the intent to conclude a Term Sheet for a PPA in March 2011.'7

More importantly Mr Nyoike’s letter did not approve the work plan on the basis that

nothing might be done if no PPA was obtained. On the contrary its terms required the

process whereby the Investor will seek a go ahead to negotiate with KPLC and the Permanent Secretary will grant

parties agreed that [C-67|/[KE-41] was submitted by Mr Walji and Mr Laing to the Ministry in March 2011 and

schedule to be strictly adhered to. Further the letter noted that the work programme
presented at the meeting of 11 March 2011 between WalAm and a Ministerial team had
stated that “[t]he initial exploratory drilling programme is planned and budgeted for with
the first full diameter well estimated to be spudded in by December 2011”. This suggests
that the Ministry had been told that WalAm had the money already for the first well (which
would be consistent with the suggestion in section 6 of the Work Program document!” that

described the status of the Geothermal Drilling Program as “Ongoing”).

The Tribunal accordingly finds that the Ministry had established a clear position as of
March 2011, that it had concerns about lack of any development progress by WalAm and
compliance with its obligations, and that it required strict adherence to the Work Program
that WalAm had itself proposed. The Ministry was entitled to expect WalAm to have
completed drilling of a first well by December 2011 and the second and third wells by July
2012.

OTHER CORRESPONDENCE FEBRUARY/MARCH 2011

There had been a flurry of correspondence in February and March 2011 in relation to
matters which could be regarded as ancillary to but not actually progressing physical
development work suggesting that WalAm was trying to generate activity, engaging with
various Kenyan authorities and third parties but in a way which would not involve

significant expenditure.'’ None of it evidences any physical activity on Suswa.

For completeness an email from Mr Walji to Ms. Njagi (the KPLC Company Secretary) of
16 March 2011!” should be mentioned. Mr Wallji stated:
As you may have been informed by Mr Njoroge that MOE and

WalAm have agreed on 2011 Suswa Geothermal Development work
program. Part of WalAm’s conditions are that before the company

draft PPA for our review ..... It is the Hon Minister for Energy’s

development and commence drilling Q4 2011...
264. The Tribunal does not view this email as altering the evidential picture as to what Mr Walji

sought, what he obtained and what he understood by the end of March 2011.

a. Though he purported to copy Mr Nyoike into the email he used an incorrect email
address (pnyoike@energymin.co.ke instead of pnyhoike@energymin.go) and the

email did not reach Mr Nyoike.!*

db. It would not in any event have called for a response from Mr Nyoike who was about

to write formally to WalAm in relation to the terms of approval of the work plan.
c. The email was sent on 16 March before Mr Nyoike responded on 23 March.

d. WalAm’s Work Plan as proposed had not in fact sought to make it a condition that
a PPA be in place before work commenced. As discussed above, item 9 of the
Work Plan suggested that a Term Sheet and finalisation of a PPA take place before
the end of March.

e. In any event even if Mr Walji had been seeking that as “part of WalAm’s
conditions” when he received Mr Nyoike’s letter of 23 March he knew and
appreciated that there was no such condition or any linkage between the conclusion
of a PPA and the steps in the Work Plan which the Ministry was requiring WalAm
strictly to adhere to. Indeed Mr Walji’s use of the phrase “WalAm’s conditions”
rather than any suggested agreement of such condition, together with the reference
to the Minister’s expectation that drilling be commenced Q4 2011 confirms that
Mr Walji well appreciated that he had not got any agreement on the part of the

Ministry to such a condition.

APPROVAL OF THE WORK PROGRAM LETTER TO THE SHOW CAUSE LETTER OF 18
APRIL 2012

(1) April 2011
265. On 12 April 2011 Mr Walji wrote to Mr Nyoike'” stating:

Thank you for your correspondence of March 23, 2011. confirming
and approving WalAm’s 2011 proposed Work Program. It is
WalAm’s intent to perform as proposed; which as you will realize
and appreciate that it is dependent on the host country cooperation
and required timely action.

The immediate necessity being the conclusion of satisfactory Power
Purchase Agreement ‘PPA’ with bankable commercial terms
satisfactory to both parties i.e. KPLC and WalAm. This will enable
us to commit funding for drilling and infrastructure developments
which as you are aware require long lead time.

We would like to advice you and re-affirm that, as stated in our 2011
Work Program, all of the proposed tasks timelines are contingent
on WalAm concluding an acceptable PPA prior to the end of May
2011. Meanwhile other work is running concurrently; otherwise, we
likely not have sufficient time required to carry out the work
program as outlined. We are proceeding with such premise.'”

266. The Tribunal considers that the terms of this letter again confirm what had already been
established and well understood. Mr Walji did not believe that he had obtained agreement
from the Ministry that timelines were dependent on a PPA being concluded. The Work
Program proposed had not contained such a contingency. The approval of it was not
contingent, indeed it required strict adherence to the dates proposed. The May 2011 date

was new and not reflective of anything discussed let alone agreed.

and directed in accordance with the Ministry’s 23 March 2011 letter. Exchanges with
KPLC in relation to obtaining a draft PPA are discussed separately below but since no
linkage with a PPA had been agreed, they are not material. There is correspondence in
relation to Redplan and the environmental and social impact assessment (“ESIA”) report
which is of significance in indicating what WalAm were and were not doing at this time

which is separately discussed below.

(3) Comparison of work done in 2011 with the 2011 Work Program

Even apart from first drilling, it is worth noting what work WalAm said would be done in
2011 and to which it committed and the Ministry approved. The table in Mr Nyoike’s
23 March letter set out the “Programmes” and adopted the timelines proposed by WalAm
in the Work Program but without the detailed steps of each programmes being copied over
from the proposed Work Program. Looking only at the table, it can be seen that WalAm
stated that they would within 2011 complete:

a. WalAm Office;

b. Environment and Social Impact Studies;
c. Owner’s Engineer-Drilling Engineering;
d. Infrastructural Development; and

e. MT Survey.

The detail of the programmes on WalAm’s work plan as submitted! shows that WalAm
Office was to involve finalising plans for a WalAm Energy Inc Nairobi office including

appointing a General Manager at an estimated cost of US$250,000.

Owner’s Engineer was to involve the issue of RFPs, interview and screening of
Geosciences, Geothermal Resources, Drilling and Engineering engineers at an estimated

cost of US$600,000.

273.

The Infrastructure programme details refer to the fact that road and water are crucial to the
commencement of the drilling, and since drilling was to be initiated with the first full
diameter well to be spudded by December 2011 (see 6g and 6h), the road and water works
necessary were being programmed to be done during 2011. Substantial cost was associated
with Infrastructural Development (Roads US$2.7_ million, Water Pipeline
US$4.96 million).

Even those matters of a relatively modest cost though not involving physical activity at
Suswa were not completed, or much progressed.'” By way of small example, even the

setting up of a Nairobi office with a general manager was not done. '*’

That there was no such progress is not surprising. WalAm did not have the financial or
technical capability to make any such progress. If it had access to the technical capability
it did not have the financial means to utilise it. On 7 November 2011 Mr Walji wrote the
Mr Nyoike, sending him “the final Suswa ESIA” prepared by Redplan.'*' He told
Mr Nyoike that he was still awaiting a draft PPA from KPLC which he expected by

' There is an annotated version of the 2011 Work Program with the status column amended and various comments
noted in the Program [C-074(D)|/[KE-55] which shows the extent of progress on the ESIA and the absence of
progress on other programmes. Some matters were suggested to be awaiting response from the MOE and the
work plan did emphasise that it would require “timely and cooperative efforts with all stakeholders” — namely,
WalAm, Ministry of Energy, GDC, KPLC, Ministry of Water and Irrigation, Ministry of Roads and NEMA. It is
not dated but WalAm says that it was sent under cover of the letter of 16 April 2012 [C-074(C)|/[KE-61] which
was itself an attachment to WalAm’s responses to the Show Cause letter which were sent by email on 23 April
[C-074(A)]/[KE-65] . It must have been prepared some time after October 2011 because it refers to the Redplan
ESIA report having been completed on October 1 1#, 2011. It refers also to “RFP Updated April 2012” which may
be a reference to the GeothermEx 5 April 2012 updated proposal [C-074(H)|/[KE-60]. A number of the
programmes are marked in the status column as “Pending completion of PPA”. In addition a “2011 Annual Report”
[C-074(E)|/[KE-56] illustrates similarly the lack of material progress and completion of the matters on the various
programmes. The accuracy even of that document is questionable in material respects — for example in suggesting
that as of 11 October 2011 the ESIA was “completed and ready for submission to NEMA” which is contradicted
by the record of communications with Redplan, considered in detail below. The document says that the
“Submission to NEMA waiting on completion of PPA” but it is unclear why that process should have needed the
PPA to be in place, other than perhaps because WalAm did not even have the money to pay the NEMA fee
estimated in this document to be US$150,000.

180 As appears from WalAm’s internal document 2012 Proposed Work Program which Mr Laing prepared and on
which Mr Walji commented. [C-030]/[KE-57], WalAm Energy Inc 2012 — Proposed Work Program Suswa
Geothermal Concession, 2012 and Transcript D2:P412 (Walji cross-examination). It was being suggested that this
would not now be done until the third quarter of 2012.

December 15. He stated that “[u]pon review and satisfactory conclusion of the same we
will be proceeding with permitting for Suswa drilling program as indicated in our 2011

work program.”

274. The ESIA report had been due, under the work plan set out in Mr Nyoike’s 23 March letter
in February to April 2011 (the dates that WalAm had itself proposed). Regardless of the
PPA, WalAm was not meeting its own proposed Work Program even for those preliminary
matters which involved modest expenditures. Mr Walji did not attempt to address in his
letter to explain the inaction and delay or to put revised dates on other steps in the Work

Program.

275. An email to a potential investor of 8 December 2011'* gives a striking picture of how
financially restricted WalAm was and the reason why WalAm was unable to progress in a
timely way even those matters which did not require major expenditure. Mr Walji indicates
that “WalAm is currently seeking US $3 million private equity investment to cover G&A
[general and administration], expenses for concluding PPA, permitting to take the project

towards drilling stage as outlined in SDP [Suswa Development Plan]”.

276. As Mr Walji accepted in cross-examination, WalAm had not had and still did not have by
December 2011 the funds necessary to cover the cost and expenses of negotiating and
concluding a PPA.'* The reference in the same email to “hav[ing] $30m’ in private equity
backing for drilling was, Mr Walji said, in fact an indication from various individuals “that

they would be able to raise 30 million.”

277. There is an annotated version of the 2011 Work Program with the status column amended
and various comments noted in the Work Program'** which shows the extent of progress

on the ESIA and the absence of progress on other programmes. It is not dated but WalAm

says that it was sent under cover of the letter of 16 April 2012'** and was together with that
letter one of the 9 attachments to Mr Walji’s email sent in response to the show cause letter
(discussed further below). It must have been prepared sometime after October 2011
because it refers to the Redplan ESIA report having been completed on 11 October 2011.
It refers also to “RFP Updated April 2012” which may be a reference to the GeothermEx
5 April 2012 update proposal.'*’ A number of the programmes are marked in the status
column as “Pending completion of PPA”. Whatever its precise date, it confirms that
WalAm did not and was not able to progress and complete the many matters it had said it
would and that the Ministry had agreed should be done in 2011, work which included both
preparatory work for development and physical activity on Suswa necessary to enable
drilling to commence. Though WalAm described matters as “pending completion of PPA”
the effective suspension of any significant work of any kind, including that which should
not have needed to await a PPA even on Mr Walji’s view of the conditioning of
commencement of drilling activity, must be seen as consequent on WalAm’s lack of

financial means and inability to build technical capacity to progress.

(4) Redplan and the ESIA process

In relation to the ESIA process, there was an inability to progress and complete it and

evidence of delay by WalAm.

a. Redplan had been appointed in March 2011 to undertake the ESIA for the area to
enable drilling of three wells, which would encompass all project planning, access

road construction, pre-drill operations, a drilling environmental management plan

and other baselines studies.'** The report would be used to obtain environmental

permits.'*

db. The Work Program showed a timeline for completion of the report, and submission
to NEMA for approval across the period February to April 2011 and 1 May to 15

June 2011 with permits being obtained from June 15 onwards.

c. On 9 May Mr Laing emailed Mr Krhoda of Redplan to say that he understood that
the ESIA was progressing very well and that he looked forward to receiving the
draft report as soon as available.'"? Mr Krhoda replied the same day to say that they
had completed gathering field information and that they were on schedule and

would be able to send the draft report soon. |"!

d. An email from Mr Krhoda of Redplan of 3 July 2011!” suggests that there was a
draft report available to WalAm by that date but that WalAm was delaying or
slowing down Redplan’s ability to progress the report and the steps necessary to

move it forward with consultation with the appropriate bodies. '*°

want to raise at this stage. There are still rounds and other layers of bureaucracy that the report shall go through

stakeholders, held in public office for inspection and gazetted for 21 days for comments, After which NEMA shall
compile comments that will need to be addressed. ....

Ido not know why WalAm thinks that the Report is shoddy while still unread, and delayed. It is probably the right
time for your technical person who will be pursuing the licence to be in NBO to meet some of the players here.
Please help the process move.”

101

An email of 22 July 2011 shows Redplan chasing for payment of an unpaid

invoice.'

Ina detailed email from Mr Krhoda of 4 August 2011 summarising the position, he
says that WalAm have already had the draft report and that WalAm has delayed the
process. Mr Krhoda’s assessment gives a good idea of the state of play and absence

of progress at that date and is worth quoting at some length:

You must have received the Draft Report (pdf) with the comments
that we needed to proceed by receiving your comments/suggestions,
edit and lodge the Final Draft with NEMA with copies to be sent to
the Ministry of Energy and District Environment Committees of the
respective districts. We also sent invoices for payment of the second
tranche according to the contract. You are also aware of our brief
regarding the entire process leading to the finalization of the ESIA
Study. Sandy had introduced Bob Mick, WalAm’s environmental
consultant who was to contact us and to discuss the progress of the
Suswa ESIA.

I must confess that the responses from yourselves to us have not been
very good; always delayed, probably because of your busy
programmes. We emphasised the need for a quick implementation
of the study and also raised pertinent issues of the study being side
tracked by distractions if we did not finalize as discussed and
contracted. The comments that were expected from Sandy and Bob
never came, our requests for payment to enable us to discharge our
Research Assistants and part time consultants never replied to, and
the essence of allowing the process to be concluded never responded
to.

Allow me to state the following:

1. The study has been grossly delayed due to limited response to
every suggestion that we made on the way forward in bringing the
ESIA Study to a logical conclusion

2. Our requests for payment after we sent the invoice was never
responded to thus causing the company unnecessary financial
stress.

194 TR-019]/[KE-49], Emails between Mr Sandy Laing (WalAm), Mr George Krhoda (Redplan), and others, 9 May

2011, p. 4.

102

3. There has been limited technical input on the design and
Programme of Action after the ESIA has been examined and before
an EIA Certificate is awarded as required for payment of NEMA
fees.

I am not qualified to advice the company that there are several
issues that will cause us to regret these delays, and some are of very
dangerous proportions:

1. We have increasingly lost the good will of project supporters on
the ground, including the Provincial Administration who were quite
upbeat about the development taking place during their tenure of
duty in the region. The district leaders, politicians and civil society
groups rallied around the project in spite of several unknowns that
we agreed will be discussed downstream. Instead of keeping project
supporters informed and briefed on next steps, all of us have gone
quite thus dimming their hope.

2. There is growing discontent regarding the legitimacy and
sincerity of the investor. The local people are able to see progress
of geothermal drilling and exploration going on in other places
along the Rift. WalAm neither has a local office nor a strong
presence in the country.

3. REDPLAN Consultants Ltd is a small firm that can be easily
paralyzed by delays in payment while retaining consultants that
have completed their work but the payment has stalled in the
pipeline.

4. The changing political environment will catch with you in your
tracks. The tenure of the present parliament/government is coming
to an end. The incumbent President will retire and a new leadership
is expected after the general elections, probably by August 2012.
The new leadership may imply new senior officers and WalAm shall
be starting negotiations afresh in everything they want to
accomplish. Of course you will have the Papers and Agreements,
but that will be all that you shall show. If Mr. Mugambi has not
advised you on this then probably you need a political/investment
analysts to help navigate the process.

Allow me to confess that time is of essence in negotiations of such
huge investments which have several stakeholders, and need for
powerful strings to be pulled at the same time. In this case reducing
the numbers of distractors and tilting support to the project
supporters in order to achieve the desired results will be the best
investment for WalAm at the present time.

103

g. That email, if accurate, is a striking indictment of WalAm’s failures to progress the
project and existential financial and technical limitations. It is significant precisely
because this related to a process (the ESIA report process which would lead to
permitting) which was a prerequisite to drilling but not part of the drilling program.
Even taking Mr Walji’s PPA precondition position at its highest, he was saying that
drilling could not commence until WalAm had a concluded PPA. The ESIA process
was never suggested to be affected by or subject toa PPA. The estimated costs of
the entire ESIA process including obtaining permits was shown as US$50,000 in
the Work Program. The email also gives a good picture of the general concern in
Kenya by stakeholders about lack of progress, especially when other geothermal
projects were progressing. The reference to “growing discontent regarding the
legitimacy and sincerity of the investor” is not made with regard to the Ministry of
Energy but more generally, but it resonates consistently with the concerns that were

being expressed by Mr Nyoike in March 2011.

h. The Tribunal has no evidential reason to doubt the accuracy of the email. Redplan
had no reason to misstate the position. There is no reply email or communication
in the record in which WalAm respond or otherwise dispute anything which Mr

Krhoda says.

i, The next communication in the record is an email of 2 November 2011'°° when
Mr Krhoda informs WalAm that it must pay the EIA licence fees to NEMA of
0.05% of the total estimate project cost of US$30,150,000 (i. about
US$15,000).'°° Mr Laing responds:

We are very pleased with the progress to date regarding the ESIA,
however, I was under the impression that we were still one step away
from submitting to NEMA. My impression was that there was one
more round of consultation where the stakeholders would make
their final comments, WalAm would respond, if required, to the final

comments, the report would undergo its final review and edit and
then it would be ready for submission to NEMA for a formal review.

to which Mr Krhoda replies:
Thanks for your communication.

The next process is handled by NEMA and the District Environment
Committees, chaired by the respective District Commissioners and
Ministry of Energy. After this round of discussion, the report will
come back to us to make the necessary changes. WalAm
representative must attend these final meetings.

There is no need of arranging one more round of public consultation
where the stakeholders would make their comments. The next public
consultation process is one managed by NEMA as required by law.
WalAm would respond, if required, in the consultations with
stakeholders during these final meetings with the district leaders
and local communities. The changes will not commit WalAm to any
social responsibility except the traditional ones such as service
provision such as employment for local people, etc. After which the
report would undergo its final edit after the stakeholders’
consultation and signed to become a NEMA Report carried out by
an interdependent consultant as required by the law.

I suggest that we proceed in this direction as expeditiously as
possible.

je That exchange confirms that the delay had been on WalAm’s side. Mr Laing’s
affirmation of Redplan’s work and progress was unqualified. Mr Laing says in his
witness statement that Redplan had sent its report to WalAm in September 2011.'"”

He makes no comment on the issues raised by Mr Krhoda.

'°7 Laing Witness Statement, P 12.

105

k. The Redplan report sent to Mr Nyoike on 7 November 2011'°* was undated and
unsigned and there was some question as to whether this was because final

payments for it had not been made.'”

Ll Nothing further appears to have happened because in March 2012 Mr Krhoda

emailed Mr Walji” saying:

It has been a little while since we heard from you. We are
increasingly becoming anxious that the process of completing the
ESAI [sic] study to its logical conclusion has grounded to a halt and
your initiatives in the sector abandoned on its truck. While we
appreciate that the investment required for the project is enormous
and complex, it is your responsibility to complete the process that
you had initiated and for which you have running contracts.

We would like to conclude this assignment and close our books as
soon as possible. Of course the Ministry of Energy, NEMA and the

keholders continue to enquire the status of the study and the
prospects for investment in their region. Currently we are engaged
in related geothermal assessments and this pending work does not
support our expertise in this area.

We shall appreciate if you could provide us with your up-dated plan
on how you would like to conclude this task and also pay us for our
services.*"'

 

m. There is no response in the record. An email from Mr Krhoda in December 20127”?
suggests that WalAm had done nothing further in this regard since November 2011

and had not paid Redplan’s outstanding invoices.

(5) Conclusions on work done in 2011

As to whether such work as was done in 2011 was legally significant in relation to the
termination, this issue is discussed in Section VIILB. WalAm relied in its Closing
Submissions on the “20/] Annual Report’.?* The assessment of what is described there
in comparison with the approved 2011 Work Program has been considered above.
Regardless of the legal requirements, from a factual perspective WalAm failed in 2011 to

complete any of the matters which it said it would complete within that year.

(6) January to April 2012

Mr Laing prepared an undated “20/2 — Proposed Work Program” which showed
“[p]lending the mutually satisfactory completion of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)
the following work program is proposed for 2012.” It is an internal discussion document,
not sent to the Ministry, and contains Mr Walji’s comments in red at the end.*°> The

document is of significance for two reasons:

a. It shows what work that had been included in the 2011 Work Program that should
have been done in 2011 had not been done — the document states “Note that most
of the 2012 work program consists of deferred work from 2011.” It thus confirms
what has been concluded above in relation to WalAm’s failure to do in 2011 even
those matters which WalAm had not sought condition on conclusion of a PPA and
of modest cost such as hiring a General Manager for a Nairobi office and submitting

the ESIA to NEMA.

db. Mr Walji’s comments on Mr Laing’s draft are revealing in showing that the time
line that had been proposed to and approved by the Ministry in March 2011 was

never achievable even if a PPA had been concluded. Mr Walji comments that:

203 [C-074(E)]/[KE-56] (referred to in footnote [196] above); See Claimant’s Closing Submission Presentation,
slide 25.

204 (C-030]/[KE-57], WalAm Energy Inc 2012 — Proposed Work Program Suswa Geothermal Concession, 2012.

205 See Transcript D2:P412 (Walji).

107

This is time line we both want but it is way too tight for the following
reasons:

Raising the $30MM [the estimated cost of exploratory drilling and
associated infrastructure] takes 6 months which means June
through December as we can’t raise anything without a signed PPA.

We won’t/can’t award contracts prior to having the money in hand
and we need about $8MM to build our share of the infrastructure
and another $0.5m to 1.0MM to do the engineering for the wells.

5. I would say the time line should be spread over another 6 to 12
months to be realistic.

c. This demonstrates that the Work Program proposed by WalAm and approved by
Mr Nyoike was never realistic or viable. That program showed a PPA (or perhaps
term sheet for a PPA) being concluded by 31 March 2011 and items 6a to 6g of the
drilling program commencing in April 2011 and being concluded in December
2011 (including initiating the drilling of up to three full diameter geothermal wells)

and item 6h the first full diameter well to be spudded December 2011.

d. The Tribunal does not need to assess whether this raises questions about Mr Walji’s
belief in the schedule he proposed to Mr Nyoike in March 2011 in the face of the
concerns about WalAm’s lack of progress and failure to develop at that time. It
does however show that even if a PPA had been concluded, WalAm would not have
been able to meet its own proposed schedule for works in 2011 and that there would
have been periods of more than 6 months when WalAm would have been doing no
work at Suswa while it sought to raise finance . Even Mr Laing’s 2012 timelines
shows nothing being done on the land until the fourth Quarter (road construction,
water pipeline construction and drilling in late December). Mr Walji said that
contracts could not be awarded until finance was raised which would defer Mr
Laing’s third quarter work program items 4 to 7 in relation to awarding contracts.
Mr Walji was in effect telling Mr Laing that, even with a PPA negotiated and
completed as suggested by Mr Laing by June 2012, no work would be done on the

206 Transcript D2:P411 (Walji cross-examination).

108

281.

282.

283.

ground until well into 2013 (six months to raise finance; then contracts to be

awarded, then work to commence on infrastructure, then drilling).

The Tribunal discusses the legal issues in relation to the show cause letter and any questions
of notice or absence of notice in relation to the Forfeiture Notice in Section VIII.B below.
Without commenting on the legal significance of the question, the Tribunal finds that on
the basis of what was and was not done in 2011, and on the basis of WalAm’s
contemporaneous documents in 2012 as to its financial limitations and projected timelines,
even if the Minister had given notice in early 2012 that WalAm should commence work in
or under the land within six months (whether in relation to infrastructure work or drilling)

it would not have been able to do so.

On 5 April 2012 GeothermEx provided an update on their 2009 proposal for technical
services related to the drilling engineer requirements at Suswa.”” It is not suggested that
this proposal was accepted or progressed and WalAm does not rely on this proposal as

work completed in 2012.7*

WalAm says that a letter dated 16 April 2012 from Mr Walji addressed to Mr Nyoike
“providing you with an update to the 2011 Suswa Work Program” and other documents””
was sent by Mr Walji attached to an email of 23 April 2012 responding to the show cause
letter.?!° Because there is an issue as to whether it was sent and because even on WalAm’s
case it was not sent before the show cause letter, it is dealt with below when that email is

considered.

18 APRIL 2012 — THE SHOW CAUSE LETTER

As of April 2012, there had been no written communication between WalAm and the

Ministry since November 2011. There had also been no written report to the Ministry on

progress of work to be done in 2011 as set out in the Work Program. As the Ministry would

have known, a first well had not been drilled and no work on infrastructure necessary to

enable drilling had commenced. On 18 April 2012 Mr Nyoike wrote to Mr Walji in the

following terms (the “Show Cause letter”):7"!

WalAm Geopower Inc. was granted the above captioned licence
covering Suswa Prospect on 5th September, 2007 for exploration,
appraisal and development of the geothermal resource therein to
construct a power plant (copy of licence attached for ease of
reference).

Under normal practice, it takes five years from geothermal resource
exploration to construction of such power plant. However, it is
noted that WalAm has not carried out sufficient work at Suswa
despite the licence running close to five years now. Under the
circumstances, it will not be possible for the company to construct
the power plant within the five years. In addition, WalAm is also in
breach of Articles 9 and 17 of the licence.

Pursuant to Article 7 of the licence, the Minister for Energy intends
to declare Geothermal Resources Licence No.1/2007 as forfeited.
Notice is, therefore, hereby given to you to show cause why this
Licence should not be forfeited.

Yours Sincerely

[Signature]

Patrick M. Nyoike, CBS
Permanent Secretary

the Chief Geologist.

Mr Nyoike said in his witness statement that this letter was written for him by Mr Omenge,

The reference to “it takes five years from geothermal resource

exploration to construction of such power plant” was “based on my experience of industry

practice.”?”?

The Tribunal considers in the legal analysis below the proper interpretation of this letter in
the statutory context. From a factual perspective the letter was clearly a culmination of
concerns that the Ministry had had for a long time. WalAm had been told in March 2011
that there were concerns about its lack of progress of development. It had made its position
clear in the 23 March 2011 letter and the schedule set out there which was to be “strictly”

adhered to, had not been performed at all.

Mr Nyoike accepted in cross-examination that the Licence did not contain any obligation
on WalAm to construct a power plant within five years but said “this was not an open-

ended License going on forever” and “you are given a license with intention to proceed”. *"

annual report for the Suswa geothermal concession for 2011?'* and “our

anticipated Work Program 2012.”°'°

c. The letter (which must have been drafted before sight of the Show Cause letter even
if not sent until after) then stated:
During the presentation of WalAm Suswa 2011 Work Program in
early 2011 it was indicated and agreed with MOE that the Suswa
exploration/ development drilling program and it’s high cost
associated work program would not be undertaken in the absence
of a bankable PPA. Please note that many items could not be

completed during 2011 as they consist of large capital expenditures
which could not be risked without an acceptable and bankable PPA.

d. As has been shown by reference to the documents from March 2011, it was not
correct to say that it had been agreed with the Ministry that
exploration/development drilling would not be undertaken in the absence of a
bankable PPA. The Tribunal rejects the suggestion, if this is WalAm’s contention,
that this letter evidences that there had been any such agreement. In its Closing
Submissions”® WalAm gave this letter as an example of “WalAm informing Kenya
that capital intensive work was contingent on a PPA”. The Tribunal agrees that it
is an example of Mr Walji repeating a position that he had made before in different
formulations that WalAm did not want to, or would not or could not commence
capital intensive work or drilling or other expensive work on the ground. As the
Tribunal has discussed above and found, Mr Walji’s repetition of that position was
made despite him knowing and understanding that it was not accepted or agreed by
the Ministry, and its continued repetition rather affirms that he so understood. The
Tribunal does not need to determine whether Mr Walji claimed that there had been

agreement to this effect with the Ministry in his letter of 16 April 2012 knowing it

not to be true or rather (and perhaps in some desperation at this stage) had persuaded

himself of that.

290. The attached ““WalAm 2012 Work Program”*' was a reworking of the table for 2011 Work
Program set out in Mr Nyoike’s 23 March 2011 letter but with the status shown for the
main matters as “[c]ontingent on successful completion of PPA”. The Tribunal notes that
this was wording in the Work Program proposed by WalAm and not agreed to by
Mr Nyoike.

291. Letter dated 22 April 2012:””

a. This was Mr Walji’s response to the Show Cause letter. He set out seven matters
which were described as “delays beyond the control of WalAm Energy Inc.” Points

5, 6 and 7 said:

5) After numerous attempts a copy of a conventional PPA was
received from KPLC in November, 2009. An unusable document
which did not reflect Geothermal Greenfield Development
contractual requirements.

6) Meanwhile WalAm completed Suswa development plan and lined
up funding in order to get Suswa project to drilling stage subject to
bankable PPA.

7) March 2011, I Tariff Rate terms were provided verbally by you;
please note that nothing has been received in writing in this regard
in spite of number of requests by WalAm’s Kenya Representative
Mr. Mugambi Gituru. After recognizing _WalAm’s work
performance and intended Work Program MOE approved the work
program for 2011 which was contingent upon concluding a mutually
agreed bankable PPA. WalAm was requested to commence PPA
negotiations with KPLC in March 2011. Subsequently Draft PPA
document promised by KPLC to be ready on or about April 15,
2011. Not received as of this date. We have been informed that there

were delays due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the control
KPLC control [sic] and workload dealing with other PPA’s.??3

db. The letter went on to “respectfully but totally disagree with the second paragraph

2204

of your letter”

1) The Licence NO. 1/2007 does not require the licensee to construct
a Power Plant within five years. The physical impossibility of
achieving the same for Greenfield Geothermal Development can be
discussed and argued under the article 19 of the referenced licence.
At that time expert opinion will agree with us that a 75 MWe
Greenfield Development cannot be achieved in the time frame
indicated especially in absence of a bankable PPA. We have no
doubt of the same. Please review your position and advice the Hon.
Minister for Energy accordingly and also our indicated position and

 

opinion.
2) The the [sic] drilling and devel associated infrastructure
de were to commence after conclusion of satisfactory

 

bankable PPA, as mutually agreed with yourself. Previously WalAm
had contemplated the option of drilling slim holes (bores) for
exploration pre PPA conclusion due to delays that had occurred in
PPA conclusion but you had personally rejected this option and
insisted that WalAm undertake full bore exploration/development
drilling. Not required under the subject licence until later stage of
exploration/development. Please refer to the Geothermal Act. Yet
WalAm was willing to cooperate and undertake high risk Full Bore
Drilling with indicated cooperation from Kenyan authorities.

It was mutually agreed that WalAm would undertake this high risk
exploration at a cost of U.S. $21Million plus approximate $9Million

of infrastructure devel provided a bankable PPA_was in
place. This cooperation was not appreciated by yourself as
indicated in your correspondence at hand.

 

 

We had concluded the annual report for 2011 in March which was
not sent out due pending an update of revised Owners Engineer's
quote from GeothermEx which was received on April 18, 2011.°%

c. The letter went on to respond to the comments on Clause 17 of the Licence.

d. An implicit threat was made to commence arbitration under Clause 19 of the
Licence — “We hope that the crossroad we are both facing can be overcome with a
mutual understanding and amicably without WalAm having to invoke its rights

under Article # 19.”
e. Mr Walji then stated:

Mr. Nyoike, with this correspondence you will note that WalAm has
not abandoned the Suswa Project in fact it is very anxious to move
the project forward with cooperation from Kenya. In this regard
may I suggest that you use your good offices to prioritize and
expedite the forwarding of the Draft Geothermal Greenfield
Development PPA. In turn initially WalAm’s very experienced
power sector/renewable energy Management Team consisting of
Mr. Falcone, Mr. Drolet, Mr Allen and the writer will review the
document. Turn it around in short order, obtain legal review and
attend to Kenya at the earliest and finalize the PPA. Based on your
proposed (March 2011) Levelised Lifetime Tariff of US $0.085 with
adjustments, we think that is reasonable starting point for 7SMWe
geothermal development.

We understand the challenges that Kenya faces and we hope that
you understand the challenges we are facing and also do understand
that the initial US $30 plus resource risk investment cannot be
undertaken with just a Geothermal Licence. Investors require much
more solid contracts.

f. The Tribunal considers Mr Walji’s references to the PPA condition as being “as
mutually agreed with yourself’ in the same way as discussed above in relation to
the 16 April 2012 letter. WalAm relied in its Closing Submissions on this letter
also as an example of WalAm informing Kenya that capital intensive work was
contingent on a PPA, and the Tribunal expresses the same view of that submission

as in relation to the 16 April 2012 letter.

It is worth noting, looking prospectively forward to the Forfeiture Notice, that 30 April
2012 was six months before the Forfeiture Notice. Insofar as therefore it is relevant to
consider what WalAm did or did not do in that six-month period, what followed is to be

considered in that context.

115

293. On 14 May 2012 Ms Meso of KPLC sent Mr Waljia draft PPA.”° She stated in her email
“[mJost of the issues will be agreed by the parties after negotiations.” Ms. Njagi gave
evidence that this draft was based on the AGIL PPA which had been substantially
concluded at this stage. Her evidence in relation to the extent to which this would have
made negotiations with WalAm easier and enabled a quick conclusion of a PPA was

helpful:

Q. And as it turned out, a draft was not provided to WalAm until
May of 2012.

Do you recall that?

A. Trecall that, but that was with full understanding from WalAm
that because it was not also ready to prepare one himself, that KPLC
did not have one which was on the shelf. We had never prepared it,
that we were actually going to do what was otherwise
unprecedented, to use the intellectual capacity of another developer,
what the resources that they are putting and share that with WalAm.
Q. Understood. We’ve already talked about the origin of this in
terms of how it came about. And as it turned out, that draft was
provided in May of 2012?

A. Yes, because that’s the--that’s how long it took to conclude.

Q. And that was my next question: At that point in time, had the
AGIL PPA been concluded?

A. Substantially concluded, substantially concluded.

Q. And had it been provided yet to the KPLC Board for its review?
A. I cannot remember. I do not remember, but I remember the
Board review process will be through first the IPP Committee of the
Board before you go to the main board, yes.

Q. Um-hmm. And do you recall when the draft was provided to
WalAm, do you remember whether it had gotten through part or all
of that board approval process?

A. Ido not remember. I do not remember that, but should I also
add that I don’t think that was--that was material--significant
because we were not going to reproduce the WalAm--the AGIL
PPA--we were really not--that was not the gist. What you wanted to
do was to have the specific provisions that related to what AGIL
contributed that is on the world confirmation, the world
confirmation, just that because that was the only thing which was
not in the 2008--the 2009 draft.

Q. So, that edition that AGIL had contributed was important to
make sure that it was in what you gave to WalAm.

726 [C-075]/[KE-67], Email from Ms Beatrice Meso (KPLC) to Mr Maherab Walji (WalAm), attaching “Blank
Geothermal PPA”, 14 May 2012.

116

A. I cannot say because we cannot--we wanted to be very careful
that we really are not--we really are not--we’re not just so vastly
saying that we are giving an AGIL PPA to WalAm.

Q. That, of course, is clear. You’re giving them a model PPA that’s
based upon--

A. Yes.

Q. --the AGIL PPA?

A. That’s true, that’s true. That’s true. But, of course--of course,
they also--the fact that there is--although you can have a PPA that
is based on another one, there are so many things which are
project-specific that you do not know that only the developer can

give.
Q. Understood. And those would remain to be negotiated
separately?

A. Those would remain to be put in by the developer because he
knows his project.”
294. Ms Njagihad 17 years’ experience of negotiating PPAs. Clearly the provision of a “model”
PPA in this way to WalAm was going to help in relation to the structure and typical terms
(all of which WalAm would have known had it been able to deploy a legal and technical
team with experience of PPA negotiations). However, the model PPA could not advance
matters in relation to the commercial terms which would have to be negotiated and which,

in critical part, would be dependent on matters such as costs particular to the developer.

295. On 14 June 2012 Mr Walji emailed Mr Nyoike to chase a reply to his letter of 22 April
which had responded to the Show Cause letter.”* He stated that WalAm had received a
draft model from KPLC on 15 May, that that was under review and that it “could be
bankable after certain missing items are brought forth and addressed by both parties. We

do not anticipate this to be a protracted task.”

296. That email was copied to Mr Mugambi Gituru who reported to Mr Walji by email on
27 June that he had met with Mr Nyoike and also the Chief Geologist informally, following
up on the reply to the Show Cause letter. Mr Gituru reported that “[a]s usual [Mr Nyoike]

said he was unhappy with your work progress and your reply contained nothing new and

therefore should be rejected.” Mr Gituru then describes a further discussion with the
Chief Geologist and then the Minister. He reports on a further meeting with the Minister
by email of 3 July in which he says that the Minister encouraged the idea of a further
meeting with GDC. *”

297. On 26 July 2012, Mr Walji wrote to Mr Njoroge, the CEO of KPLC, copying Ms Njagi in
relation to the draft PPA.**' He said:

During our internal review, we noted that although the document may lead to a bankable PPA a
number of gaps exist within this document which need tobe addressed; not just for the benefit of
the developer/seller's interest but also for KPLC's interests. In this regard from our review, we
would like to pose clarification comments and questions to your company which are attached for
your legal department's response who were the originator of the PPA documents received. The
response in turn will enable us to get the document reacy for a legal review by our counsel.
Subsequently we will provide you with a legally reviewed PPA document which we hope will be
acceptable to both parties and also open up final negotiations in Kenya.

In regard to the power tariff we were wondering if KPLC has set a baseline Tariff or would
you prefer WalAm to set the baseline tariff and if so on what basis e.g. Levelised Lifetime
Tariff which would be most suitable in this instance or any other methodology that you
may prefer.

Please also note that the Suswa Project is at a point whe’eby WalAm has to move forward with
permitting and a very capital intensive drilling and development program at the concession. In
order for WalAm to undertake the MOE approved work program, our position and understanding
with the Ministry of Energy is that a comprehensive bankable Greenfield Development PPA has
to be in place. The work program is laid out in the letter fom Ministry of Energy dated 23 March
2011 which was copied to you. Also attached for your corvenience.

We would appreciate your early response in order for us to provide you with a comprehensive

negotiable PPA document which we hope will be bankable for both parties and will lead to being
a model PPA for Geothermal Greenfield Development in Kenya.

298. The cover email asked Mr Njoroge to prioritise the matter “in order for WalAm to be able

to start drilling at Suswa before the end of the year.”
299. The letter attached 1% pages of comments and questions.

300. There was a lack of reality in Mr Walji’s letter as to how quickly PPA negotiations would

take. Whether this was as a result of naivety stemming from his lack of experience or

because he wished to create a record of stating that drilling could start by the end of the
year (i.e. within 6 months) in view of the Show Cause letter does not critically matter. The
Tribunal would note however that, in the light of Mr Walji’s comments on Mr Laing’s
revised timeline at the beginning of 2012 (“Raising the $30MM takes 6 months which
means June through December as we can’t raise anything without a signed PPA”)
Mr Walji cannot genuinely have believed there was any prospect, as at 26 July 2012 of

drilling commencing in 2012.

The Tribunal notes also that Mr Walji’s very limited queries and questions were being
raised more than two months after receiving the draft PPA from KPLC (and that delay
being in the context of the Show Cause letter and the known concerns of Mr Nyoike about

lack of progress).

Mr Njoroge replied promptly the next day by email through Ms Meso saying: “[t]hrough
our CEO Mr. Njoroge, I wish to suggest that our preferred mode of handling the PPA
process is that you markup the draft we have given you and return to us the marked up

document for our review.”***

A month later, on 28 August 2012, Mr Walji provided a mark up and said in the cover
email that the draft PPA that KPLC had provided was incomplete and asked for a more

235

complete document.?** MS Meso replied the same day’* saying that a substantive response

would follow but that:
This is a generic PPA which in our understanding is intended to
evolve to a PPA with firmed up positions between the parties thus

Regarding the schedules again, we cannot be in position to give
specific details describing your plant hence this will be arrived at
after discussions with you.

304. In cross-examination Mr Walji was asked:

Q. So, you understood from this that KPLC required information
from you on the details of the plant that you would build; is that
correct?

A. Yes.**°

305. On7 September 2012 Ms Meso sent Mr Walji the PPA main body and schedules and asked

for the information package on the project.?”

306. Schedule 5 of the draft was the schedule providing for Tariff and Payment. Progress on
negotiating commercial terms including tariff was going to require information from
WalAm on project costs.** Mr Walji understood that but was either unwilling or unable
to provide KPLC the information package which they needed. Mr Walji’s important

evidence on this was as follows:

Q. Could you go, sir, now to Page 1145. It’s headed, "Schedule 5:
Tariff and payment."

Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. And that subject matter, tariff and payment, that would have
been of great importance to both Parties, wouldn’t it?
A. Yes, it would have been.

Q. You see Number 1, the heading is "Energy Charges.
Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. And there’s a list of formulae.

And then over the page on 1146, Number 2, "interim capacity
payments."

Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. And there are more formulae, and over the page to 1149, do you
see Number 3, "capacity payments"?

A. Yes.

Q. And then there’s more formulae. And that runs on to the end of
Schedule 5. It comes to force majeure at Page 1155, but until then,
it’s about the formulation of the tariff, isn’t it?

A. Yes, it is.

Q._ And did you understand that these formulae set forth a detailed
methodology for the calculation of a tariff?

A. Yes.

Q._ And did you understand that you would need to identify your
project costs before any formula could produce a tariff?

A._Yes.

Q.__And that would involve knowing the size of the power plant;
correct?

 

 

 

 

 

 

A._ Yes.

Q._And the cost of that power plant.

A._Yes.

Q.__And you didn’t provide any c on this Schedule 5, did
you?

A. Don was handling that, and this was--this was to be--as far as I
1 ber and understood, this was to be concluded at a later stage

 

when the whole PPA was put together, in our version provided to
KPLC.
Q.__And at this stage, WalAm did not provide any on
Schedule 5, did it?

A. Because the full document was not ready.

Q. Well, you see--what else you were you expecting in terms of
tariff and payment formulae from KPLC before the document would
be ready?

A._I’'ll need to re-read the whole request and answer your question.
Q. Could you just go back to Tab 76, and there you will find the
rest of the PPA. We were just looking at the schedules which were
behind Tab 77. The main body of the PPA is at Tab 76. That’s
C-79(b).

Do you see that?

A. Yes, I see that.

Q. Would you agree with me that that is a substantial document?
A. Substantial but incomplete.

Q. And so some of the things that were incomplete, if you look
at--it’s just the second page of the document, 1028, it says in track
changes at the bottom, "Schedules 10 and 12 do not exist," and it
describes things in relation to that.

Do you see that?

A. I guess I do.

Q. And so you were into the detail of pointing out that Schedules
10 and 12 did not exist at this stage; correct?

A. Yes.

 

 

 

 

121

Q. And you were considering this document, which runs from
Page 1027 of the bundle through to 1,106. That’s the main body of
the PPA; you agree?

A. Yes.

Q. Tariff and payment was a schedule that was present; correct?
A. Yes.

Q._ And you could have 1 on that, couldn’t you?

A._It was our concrete decision. I recall that that was to be handled
once the whole PPA package was ready, then we would complete
the whole document all at once and not in piecemeal basis.
Q.__And you were conscious of the KPLC requests to you for
information, were you?

A._I’m sorry?

Q. The e-mails that we looked at earlier today where KPLC was
asking you for information, you were aware of that?

A. Yes, and we had our method of handling.

Q._ You had a method of handling.

 

 

A._Yes.
Q. Our method or a method?
A._A method.

Q.__And that method included not marking up Schedule 5; is that
right?

A._Not dealing with the PPA in piecemeal basis.

Q._ And not providing any information on project costs; correct?
A._Not at that stage.

Q. Which would have been essential for the determination of a
capacity charge; right?

A. And that would have been handled in due course. Like I
mentioned, we didn’t want to do it on piecemeal basis.

Q. Could you go to Page 1110. It’s Schedule 1.

Do you have that?

It’s Schedule 1: — "Exploration confirmation and construction
programs."

Do you have that page?

A. That’s Page 1110?

Q. Exactly, sir.

Then you see Part A: "Reservoir exploration period."

Do you see that?

A. I see Schedule 1.

Q. And then just below that: "Part A, Reservoir exploration
period."

A. Yes, I see that.

Q. And then "Construct exploration drilling infrastructure?"

Do you see that?

 

122

A. Yes.

Q. "Drill at least two exploration wells?"

Do you follow?

A. Yes.

Q. Then Part B: "Reservoir confirmation period," and there are
six bullet points under that.

Do you see those?

A. Yes.

Q. And then Part C, "Construction period," and then there’s five
bullet points under that.

Do you see those?

A. Yes.

Q. And there’s a comment. That’s a WalAm comment, isn’t it?

A. I believe so.

.__It says: "More detailed specification required from KPLC.
Alternatively, WalAm can provide further detailed schedule input in
regard to geothermal greenfield devel in_the next draft.
Please confirm preference."

Do you see that?
A._Yes.
Q.__So, you were asking in your first alternative, you were asking
KPLC to provide specifications about your project; is that right?
A.__We were just being--we were requesting that information for
efficiency.
Q._Information on the drilling of exploration wells at Suswa. You
were requesting that from KPLC?
A._No.
You'll recall that this was reported to be the model PPA derived
from others--other two that had been negotiated.
And we were trying to get as_much information and clarity as
possible for efficiency.
Q. And those other ones involved different wells on different pieces
of land.
A._None of the wells were drilled at that time, so_at that time
differences could not be distinguished.
Q. But you’d need to know your own project-specific costs to be
able to fill out this schedule, wouldn’t you?
A. That, we knew.
Q. You'd need to know your project-specific costs with sufficient
certainty to base a capacity charge rate on it, wouldn’t you?
A._Yes.
Q._ And you didn’t know that at this point in time, did you?
A. We had the definite verified information.
OQ. Why didn’t you put it in Schedule 1?
A._As I mentioned before, we were going to complete--once we got

all the ding documentation, the team would go to work on

the PPA and legal expertise, et cetera, would all come together. We
did not want to have numerous meetings and go back and forth, so
we wanted to put the whole package together.

Q._ Even though KPLC had asked you for information that only you
could provide.
A. They had _re ested that information to be leted in the
PPA”

 

 

The Tribunal considers that this evidence suggests at least a decision on the part of WalAm
to delay the provision of such information as it had in relation to project costs which would
have been critical to enable negotiations with KPLC to progress and despite KPLC’s
requests for that information which it made clear (and Mr Walji understood) it needed.

WalAm for example never gave KPLC the SKM Report.”

On 23 September Mr Walji emailed Ms Meso attaching comments on the draft PPA and
Schedules but saying “[t]his PPA is far from complete and it will still have to through Legal
Review, Financial Review, Owners Engineer’s Analysis etc.”*"' Presumably this was a
reference to WalAm’s further review but on 14 October Mr Walji chased Ms Meso for a
response.*? On 1 November Mr Walji then emailed Mr Njoroge referring to a conversation
he had had with Ms Meso and suggesting that it would be more practical to use the AGIL

PPA, which he understood had been concluded, as a model.**

30 OCTOBER 2012 — THE FORFEITURE NOTICE
On 30 October 2012 the Minister wrote to WalAm as follows:

Zam concerned that despite having granted a Geothermal Resource
Licence to WalAm Geothermal Inc on 5th September 2007, there
have not been any apparent efforts made by the company to explore
and exploit geothermal resources in the Suswa geothermal field and
ultimately to construct a power plant. Under normal practice, it
takes five (5) years from geothermal resource exploration to

construction of a power plant which period has since been exceeded.
This amounts to a direct violation by the company of its obligations
under Clauses 7 and 9 of the said Licence.

Given this untenable position, I hereby exercise the powers
conferred on me by the Geothermal Resources Act, 1982 in Section
11 (1) (a) as the Minister for Energy and I forthwith revoke the
Licence granted to WalAm Geopower Inc with effect from the date
of this letter.

This decision shall hereinafter be published in the Kenya Gazette as
per the provisions of the Law.

WalAm says that it did not receive the letter until 28 November 2012 because it had been

314. Before WalAm had received the Forfeiture Letter, it sent an expression of interest to apply

for a GRMF grant.”

315. Mr Walji wrote to the Minister in relation to the Forfeiture Notice on 5 December 2012.”
He set out the history from WalAm’s perspective, stating in particular that from 22 March
2011:
WalAm’s [sic] has considered that it had an understanding with
MOE that the capital intensive drilling and infrastructure work
program would not be undertaken until a bankable PPA was in
place and that both sides would work towards a PPA in a timely

manner. WalAm stood ready to receive a draft model PPA from
KPLC.

316. Mr Waljialso stated that:

[I]t is not WalAm who has caused the delays nor stopped work on
the Suswa project. In fact the company has been ready willing and
able to perform but has been restrained to a large extend [sic] due
to delays and lack of coordinated effort forthcoming.

317. Subject to one matter, the Tribunal does not consider that this and subsequent exchanges
either add materially to the assessment of the relevant facts prior to termination, nor that

any separate legal issue arises as a result.

318. Mr Nyoike responded on 19 December 2012.** His letter referred to the fact that in respect
of four matters — drilling as recommended by GeothermEx, MT survey as included in the
SKM Development Plan, drilling in accordance with the approved Work Program in
Mr Nyoike’s letter of 23 March 2012 and work on roads and water — WalAm had not
undertaken work. These were all matters covered by the Work Program. The letter

concluded by saying that:

The failure by WalAm to execute the above mentioned critical

milestones was a reflection of the inability of the company to meet

its obligation under the [Licence]. Given the foregoing state of

affairs the license remains terminated.
The Tribunal considers that this letter is of some relevance and significance if it were
necessary to consider what the Minister would have decided, were it established that his
actual decision was infected by illegality and that, as a matter of Kenyan law, it should be
determined what his decision would have been had he correctly applied the GRA and/or
taken into account all relevant considerations and/or not taken into account irrelevant

considerations.

The further exchanges between Mr Walji and Mr Nyoike, and the Minister which led first
to attempts to find an amicable settlement of the dispute with the possibility of
reinstatement of the Licence being discussed, but ultimately to commencement of the
arbitration by Request for Arbitration on 26 January 2015 are not of significance to the

factual issues which the Tribunal has to decide.

THE EXCHANGES AND DISCUSSIONS WITH KPLC IN RELATION TO A PPA

The Tribunal has, in outlining the key contemporaneous communications in the record
touched on the important exchanges between WalAm and KPLC in relation to a PPA.
Because of the allegations made by WalAm in respect of that process, the Tribunal
considers some of those aspects in more detail here and makes certain findings.

a. WalAm had a preliminary indicative term sheet for a PPA*”

prepared by a
specialist energy lawyers, Heenan Blaikie.’ It was shared with KPLC at meetings
in March 2009. It proposed a single tariff structure covering a capacity charge and
an energy charge so as to give WalAm an internal rate of return of 25% after tax

from the capacity charge, though Mr Walji said this was an error and it should have

said before tax. It set out various terms which would have obviously been
regarded as unacceptable by KPLC but which Mr Walji said would all have been

up for negotiation.

db. A draft Memorandum of Understanding dated 7 April 2009? contained at
Schedule B amended terms of those set out in the indicative term sheet. The
requested IRR was now 18.5% after tax. But, as with the indicative term sheet,
because no costings were provided and known, no proposal could be made as to
what the tariff would actually be. It is also notable that the draft Memorandum of
Understanding, in clause 5 provided that WalAm’s counsel would have the
responsibility for drafting the PPA, but as Mr Walji accepted, WalAm never did so
though he said that KPLC said they would provide one.”*

c. As shown by exchanges between WalAm and KPLC such as the email from David
Mwangi, the Chief Manager of KPLC, to Mr Walji of 21 July 2009,?* any
discussion of a PPA even in outline or with a view to a term sheet, was necessarily
going to require agreement on a tariff, perhaps the most important component of
any agreement. WalAm had proposed to KPLC that the tariff structure would be a
single rate tariff (US$/Kwh).** As appears from Mr Walji’s letter of 14 April
2009,?*° at the meeting on 9 April, KPLC had said they would require a tariff
structure comprising a (fixed) capacity charge (US$/kW/year) and a variable
energy charge (US cents/kWh). Mr Walji had said in his letter that he did not
anticipate this would be a problem but needed to discuss it with his lawyer and

economist. In his email of 21 July 2009 Mr Mwangi confirmed that that was the
tariff structure that KPLC would require and indicated that KPLC were looking
forward to receiving a revised tariff proposal on that basis. The ball was in
WalAm’s court to put numbers on a proposal — to specify the capacity charge,
WalAm would need to know its costs including the costs of building the power

plant. **’ It did not know those costs.

d. Indeed, as Mr Walji accepted, following discussions with Mr Mwangi in
Washington, D.C. in November 2009, it was for WalAm to finalise documentation

generally taking into account the drafts and the discussions that had taken place.”°*

322. The 2011 Work Program item 97° contemplated concluding a term sheet for a PPA in the
period 7 March to 31 March 2011. Mr Walji seems to have thought that if a term sheet
could be agreed, after that a PPA would not take long to finalise. It was estimated that

there would be costs of doing this of US$65,000.

323. The Tribunal has considered the sequence of contemporaneous records of the progress of
discussions between WalAm and KPLC in relation to developing a PPA in particular the

following documents referred to above:

The Tribunal has also considered the evidence, by witness statement and oral evidence at
the evidential hearing of in particular Mr Walji and Ms Njagi and the witness statement of

Mr Shibuyanga?”' in relation to the dealings between WalAm and KPLC.

It does not find that there was any unreasonable conduct let alone bad faith on the part of
KPLC in relation to the discussions. There were delays on both sides. In 2011 there was
some slow to-and-fro between Mr Walji and KPLC as he sought to obtain a draft PPA and
KPLC offered to provide something but wanted to wait until they had concluded

negotiations with AGIL before providing a draft.?”

But there were more fundamental issues which meant that WalAm could not have achieved

a concluded PPA.

WalAm was not in a position to make a sufficiently detailed proposal — indeed its
original contemplation was that it would draft the full PPA but lack of funds

precluded it doing so.

WalAm did not have the capability (technical or financial) to take forward PPA
negotiations to a conclusion. There is a lack of clarity about what exactly WalAm
was trying to achieve in the period after the grant of the Licence — there are
references to memoranda of understanding, indicative term sheets and other
documents that would have been preparatory and perhaps not even binding.
WalAm was clearly desirous of obtaining some document on the basis of which it
could seek to attract investment. But it was not in a position to conclude a PPA and

did not actually suggest that that was what it sought in the first instance.

A concluded PPA would have required in particular agreement on tariff. The
capacity charge component of the tariff would have been dependent on costs and in
particular the costs of development and of construction of the power station.

WalAm was never in a position to estimate those costs with precision. The very

broad estimates given by SKM were subject to many variables. Costs would also
be affected by the productivity of the first wells and the question whether further
wells would be necessary. In addition, WalAm created its own obstacle to
conclusion of a PPA by taking a position throughout that what it required was an
“acceptable” PPA. WalAm in particular was set on obtaining an internal rate of
return on its investment at a level which KPLC was not yet near the time which it
could consider and agree absent a vast amount of further information which WalAm

was not yet able to produce.

Ms Njagi, KPLC Company Secretary and a part of the executive management team,
was involved in structuring, procuring and negotiating PPAs with private sector
developers for all independent power projects from 1997. She describes in
paragraphs 7 to 10 of her witness statement the limitations on WalAm’s ability to
negotiate a PPA in the way that would have been expected and would have been
normal for a developer. Mr Walji attended discussions on his own when a
developer would need and would usually have a team of legal, technical and
financial experts and advisers to negotiate on its behalf. Mr Walji did not have a
sufficient understanding of the issues in order to negotiate and prepare a PPA. The
negotiation of the tariff would be based on the financial model provided by the
developer. She says in paragraphs 9-10:

Without such a model it was impossible for us to negotiate any tariff

and to conclude a PPA. As I recall, we requested WalAm’s financial

model but never received one. We also would have needed detailed

information regarding the development, such as project costs,

including costs of financing, key project milestones, and details of

equipment and machinery requirements. ... We also saw no evidence

of WalAm engaging with any lenders or providing information on

the terms on which the project would be financed.

A PPA could not be negotiated by email (and in addition to detailed and complex
negotiation across various issues and areas of expertise, would require a number of

complex related transactional agreements). From Mr Walji’s “Preliminary

132

Indicative Term Sheet” in March 2009?" on which Ms Njagi made detailed
manuscript annotations, Ms Njagi questioned WalAm’s understanding of the role
and requirements of a developer in a geothermal energy project?” and her
subsequent dealings with Mr Walji led her to question his knowledge and

understanding of the PPA negotiations process.””°

f. Mr Walji had from the outset a misconception about how quickly a PPA could be
negotiated. In the 2011 Work Program proposed in March 2011 he was suggesting
it could be completed by the end of that month. In later documents and in 2012
WalAm was suggesting it could be done in 3 months. Ms Njagi was of the strong

view that this was wrong.

Q. And per Mr. Njoroge’s recommendation and his suggestion, that
they contacted the KPLC on March 28, 2011, in order to obtain a
draft PPA.

Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. And that’s what happened?

A. Yes.

Q. And then, as you were just confirming to the Tribunal, the
document that you wished to provide to him was, at that point, 30 to
40 percent ready, and you thought you'd have it done for them by
the middle of April?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you knew from the second paragraph that Mr. Walji was
anxious to receive that document?

A. Yes.
Q. For the reasons he expressed.
A. Yes.

Q._And then at the bottom of the third paragraph, he says: "Since
we will be working from your draft model based on pre-determined
Feed-in Tariff and pre-determined tariff adju the process of
concluding the negotiations should be easier."

I think that’s what he’s saying. That’s just what he’s saying. And
you understood that was his view, anyway?

A. Which I disagreed completely with.

Ultimately WalAm was under a misconception from the start as to what was involved in
concluding a PPA both as to cost and time. It thought that it could be done quickly and
that investment capital would immediately flow in to WalAm to enable it to progress the
capital intensive infrastructure and drilling work. It was wrong in all respects and there
must be a question as to whether WalAm’s financial limitations meant that its investment

was in truth doomed from the start.

GDC

GDC was formed in 2008 with a mandate to support private sector entry into power

generation from geothermal resources in Kenya.””

WalAm alleges that GDC had a desire in fact to take back all of Kenya’s geothermal
concessions including those already granted to private investors for development and that
Dr Simiyu, the CEO of GDC, told an independent geothermal consultant, Dr Bloomquist,

as much in a conversation in early 2009.?”

The Tribunal does not find that there was any such intention or motivation on the part of
Kenya through GDC with regard to concessions which had already been granted. Rather,
as appeared from Dr Bloomquist’s oral evidence clarifying the context of his discussion

279

with Dr Simiyu:

He was talking to GDC as a consultant to USAID and therefore a potential source

of funds.
The conversation had been casual.

Dr Bloomquist, after reminding himself of GDC’s mandate under the law
establishing it, said that GDC was intended actually to develop and then market
steam reserves to the private sector which would enter the project as project
developer, power plant developer and operator. In that respect the intent was that
GDC would mitigate some of the risk in order to facilitate the entry of private

investments.

Dr Bloomquist disowned the implication placed on his evidence that his evidence
in relation to his conversation with Dr Simiyu evidenced GDC policy: “J’m not

saying that this was, you know, a GDC policy. This Mr Simiyu’s opinion’. **°

WALAM’S FINANCIAL POSITION

The Tribunal has referred in the course of the chronological analysis to much evidence
which reflects WalAm’s financial position at the date of the grant of the Licence and
subsequently. WalAm had no significant assets at any time during the period from the grant
of Licence to forfeiture. Its financial statements”! show current assets of never exceeding
a few hundred thousand dollars, and minimal cash. Mr Walji’s emails in late 2007 and

early 2008 show that even obtaining very small amounts of money was difficult. See:

Program at any time up to November 2012.7" A WalAm presentation of August 20127
shows WalAm trying to raise US$3 million to fund the conclusion of negotiations of the
PPA. The document and Mr Walji’s evidence in cross-examination on it”** confirmed that
WalAm’s financial incapacity was not limited to an inability to finance infrastructure and
drilling costs. It was unable even to finance the costs of negotiating the PPA which it was
pressing repeatedly as the key to it being to obtain the large investments necessary to
progress development. The document states at that “the direct costs associated with
concluding the PPA in Kenya are estimated by WalAm at $1,500,000”.?*’ The document
also showed** that WalAm had at this stage accounts payable of US$350,000 which
included, according to Mr Walji, US$20-30,000 still outstanding as owed to Redplan.*”

The date of this document is significant being more than three months after the Show Cause
letter and very shortly after Mr Walji had written to Mr Njoroge on 26 July 20127” to
suggest that WalAm was ready and keen to enter into PPA negotiations with a view to a

quick conclusion of the PPA.

335. The Claimant reiterated the same request in its Reply.

336. On 24 May 2018, in accordance with the Tribunal’s instructions, the Claimant submitted

an updated request for relief as follows:

1. On the basis of the foregoing, Claimant respectfully requests that
the Tribunal:

(a) DECLARE that Respondent’s purported forfeiture of the License
is illegal, null and void and of no effect;

(b) ORDER that Respondent, through its Ministry of Energy, take
such steps as are necessary to:

(i) reinstate or reissue the License and amend its term to be 25 years
from the date of reinstatement (plus the existing option for Claimant
to extend said term by two 5-year periods); and

(ii) cause the KPLC to enter into negotiations with Claimant for a
PPA, including by issuing a letter of request to the KPLC;

(c) ORDER Respondent to pay Claimant the damage it has suffered
since the date of the forfeiture to the date of the Award (to be
assessed on the basis of the time value of its lost profits for that time
period);

(d) ORDER, if Respondent fails to reinstate or reissue to Claimant
the License for Suswa or cause KPLC to enter into PPA
negotiations, Respondent to pay Claimant compensation in the
amount of at least US$ 339.6 million (including interest) as of 16

(e) If, pursuant to the Order set forth in (a) to (d) above, negotiations
with KPLC (i) do not commence or (ii) commence but do not
conclude, within ninety (90) days from the date of this Award or
such other time as may be agreed between the Parties, the Order
will cease to have effect and a case management conference will be
scheduled within fourteen (14) days of a request by either Party to
establish the procedure to finally determine Claimant's claim for
damages;

339. The Parties’ respective positions in regard to the matters at issue in this arbitration are
summarised in the sections that follow. The Tribunal emphasizes that it has considered the
full extent of the Parties’ arguments in their written and oral submissions. The fact that a
given argument might not be referred to expressly in the brief summary of the Parties’
positions included in this Award should not be considered as an indication that the Tribunal

has not considered the argument.

PARTIES’ POSITIONS
(dd) Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over its claims brought pursuant to
both Kenyan law and customary international law. It argues that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
is founded on the basis of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention and Kenyan law, which

incorporates customary international law.””°

The Claimant argues that the Parties consented to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over claims
founded in Kenyan law and customary international law by agreeing, in Article 19 of the
Licence, to arbitrate “all disputes arising out of this license or relating to any investment
made under it”.””’ The Licence has no applicable law provision. The Claimant argues that
in the absence of an agreement between the Parties regarding the applicable law, the
Tribunal must turn to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention which states that “the Tribunal
shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the
conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.””* Claimant
thus argues that by consenting to arbitrate disputes “pursuant to” the ICSID Convention,
Respondent agreed to arbitrate claims arising under Kenyan law and rules of international

law.”

The Claimant further argues that when the Respondent accepted the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
over claims arising under Kenyan law, the Respondent also consented to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction over claims founded in customary international law because Kenyan law

expressly recognises and incorporates international law pursuant to Article 2(5) of the

Kenyan Constitution which states that “[t]ie general rules of international law shall form

part of the law of Kenya” >

(2) Respondent’s Position

As a preliminary point, the Respondent contends that the Claimant’s submission on
applicable law, that the scope of the Parties’ consent to arbitrate covers both claims under
Kenyan law and under customary international law is actually a question of jurisdiction. It
argues that the Tribunal lacks subject matter jurisdiction over claims brought under
customary international law unless they are made through Article 42 of the ICSID
Convention or through Kenyan law.**' The Respondent’s position is that “[t]he Parties
have not consented to the Tribunal adjudicating claims brought under customary

international law as such.”**

The Respondent explains that the applicable law in this arbitration is to be determined in
accordance with the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the Convention (“Jn the absence
of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the
dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as
may be applicable.”)** It argues that consenting to arbitration under the ICSID Convention
does not constitute consent to the Tribunal having jurisdiction over claims made under
customary international law and does not itself make any rule of customary international

law applicable to this dispute.**

According to the Respondent, only Kenyan law is applicable in the present case. Its
position is that Kenyan law applies because it is the law of the State party in dispute, the
law of the State in which the investment was made, and the law under which the Licence
was issued and subsequently forfeited. The Respondent submits that a rule of international

law may be applicable if a rule of Kenyan law is contrary to it, or if the subject matter of a

claim is not addressed by Kenyan law but is addressed by international law.**° To the extent
that Kenyan law may incorporate customary international law, the relevant rules of
international law would apply as Kenyan law.*° However, international law plays no role
in the merits of this case because the Claimant has not alleged that Kenyan law is contrary

to international law or that there is a lacuna in Kenyan law.*””

TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention states that “the Tribunal shall apply the law of the
Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such

rules of international law as may be applicable.

The Tribunal considers that the applicable law is Kenyan law as the law under which the
Licence was issued and the law of the State party to the dispute. Questions such as the
validity of the Licence and whether it has been forfeited in accordance with the statute
pursuant to which it was purportedly granted fall to be considered under the legislation
which forms part of Kenyan law. Similarly, the questions of the legality of the declaration
of forfeiture (including challenges made to the basis and manner of the Minister’s

decisions) fall to be considered under the constitutional and public law of Kenya.

Customary international law could be relevant to a particular issue through Kenyan law
insofar as customary international law is incorporated into Kenyan law. (Article 2(5) of
the Kenyan Constitution provides that “[t]he general rules of international law shall form
part of the law of Kenya’’.) But that would not be to change the applicable law to that issue
but rather to apply Kenyan law including the incorporated “general rules” of customary

international law.

The Respondent also accepts that a rule of international law could become applicable if (i)
arule of Kenyan law is contrary to a rule of international law or (ii) the subject matter of a

claim is not addressed by Kenyan law but is addressed by international law. There is no

need to consider whether such circumstances would fall to be considered by application of
Article 2(5) of the Kenyan Constitution or Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention (or both)
because the Claimant does not allege that any rule of Kenyan law is contrary to

international law or that Kenyan law does not address the subject matter of the claim.

The Claimant argues that international law has a wider application (i) because the Licence
has no applicable law provision and (ii) because of the jurisdiction agreement in Article 19
of the Licence. Thus, it is argued, by consenting to arbitrate disputes “pursuant to” the
ICSID Convention, the Respondent agreed to arbitrate claims under Kenyan law and rules
of international law. That submission states the effect of the jurisdiction agreement too
broadly. The Licence does not have an applicable law provision because it does not need
one — it is not a domestic law contract but a Licence issued (purportedly) under a Kenyan
statute and regulations and therefore its existence and any validity derives from and is
subject to Kenyan law. As to the Article 19 of the Licence, the Claimant is correct that the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction is sourced in the ICSID Convention and that international law is
applicable to questions of jurisdiction. As the Tribunal held in paragraph 111 of its
Decision on the Respondent’s Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction the determination of
whether the requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention are satisfied is a question
of international law. That does not however have the effect of extending the application of

international law for that reason to questions on the merits.

THE VALIDITY OF THE LICENCE

PARTIES’ POSITIONS
(dd) Claimant’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Claimant (i) did not make an application for the Licence
and (ii) that in the absence of an application, the Minister did not have the authority to grant

WalAm the Licence. As a consequence, it submits that the Licence is null and void.*°*

The Claimant’s position is that in July 2007, it did indeed make an application with the
Minister of Energy to explore and develop Suswa (the “Application”)*” and that by letter
of 31 July 2007,°"° the Minister informed the Claimant that it had reviewed the Application

and decided to grant it a geothermal resources licence.*!!

The Claimant submits that the Licence was granted in accordance with both the GRA and
the GRR. It explains that those instruments make clear that authorities and licences are
granted at the discretion of the Minister, and that the purpose of an application for a licence
is to enable the Minister to assess the suitability of the grant of a geothermal resource

licence to an applicant.*!”

The Claimant argues that the formalities listed in Regulation 4 of the GRR are not “strict
and inflexible.” Even if they were not covered in the Application, such Application still
complies with the Regulation 4 because it provided the Minister the necessary information

313

to satisfy the Minister of the applicant’s suitability.*'’ Unlike the geothermal resource

authority, nothing in the GRA and GRR requires even a written application. Therefore, the

fact that the Minister considered the Claimant’s Application and decided to grant the

Licence is sufficient.*"*

The Claimant argues that even if the Tribunal was to consider that the Licence was granted
without a specific application for a licence, it remains valid because the elements set out in

Regulation 4 of the GRR are mere formal requirements.*"*
The Claimant also argues that Kenya’s practice supports its position. It argues:

[Kenya granted] several licenses to developers on the basis of
applications that do not satisfy each of the elements identified in the
GRR. The status of other licenses is anything but irrelevant. If
WalAm’s License is null and void, so too must be these other
licenses; that Kenya continues to recognize their validity makes
Claimant’s point. If, as Respondent wrongly suggests, the
application requirements are statutory elements that cannot be
varied by the Minister, the Minister cannot then have discretion to
vary this principle by declaring only WalAm’s License null and void
(i.e., Respondent cannot have it both ways).*'°

In addition, the Claimant argues that the importance of the underlying procedure must be
weighed against the individual rights. The invalidity of the Licence would result in the
substantial deprivation of WalAm’s rights and result in no discernible benefit to the public
interest.*!”

The Claimant also argues that the Respondent is prohibited from asserting that the Licence

is a nullity because it cannot benefit from its own wrongdoing.*"*

Finally, the Claimant argues that Kenya is estopped from declaring the Licence invalid.*”
According to the Claimant:
By its terms, the License purports [sic] it was duly granted in

accordance with the GRA and the GRR and legally issued by the
Minister and bears his signature. Since September 2007, WalAm

devoted substantial time and efforts in reliance on this License for
several years and Respondent treated the License as valid.
Thereafter, in response to Kenya’s wrongful declaration of
forfeiture and with the understanding that the License was validly
issued, WalAm initiated this Arbitration. Until this Counter-
Memorial, at no stage did Respondent suggest any question
regarding the validity of the License (or the arbitration agreement
contained therein). In fact, Respondent’s position is essentially an
argument on jurisdiction guised as an argument on the merits. ...
Respondent’s obligation to raise such argument “as early as
possible” cannot have been met here where an entire jurisdictional
phase has been concluded.*”

(2) Respondent’s Position

The Respondent’s position is that the Licence is a nullity because it was granted without
an application.*' The Respondent argues that under the applicable statutory framework, a
valid licence could only be issued following the filing of an application in the approved
form.*” Since the Claimant never submitted an application for the Licence, as required

under Kenyan law, the Licence is void ab initio

The Respondent argues that the requirements in the GRA are not, as the Claimant argues,
a “mere formality’.*** The Respondent explains that under the GRA and the GRR an
application is a mandatory requirement. A minister’s discretion to grant a licence cannot
be exercised unless and until the application (containing specific information) has been
made. This is so that the Minister has sufficient information to properly assess the
capabilities of potential developers and to ensure that licences are only granted when they

are consistent with the GRA.*> The Respondent submits that the failure of the Claimant

to follow the application procedure resulted in it being granted the Licence without a proper

assessment of WalAm’s experience and capabilities.*”°

The Respondent further argues that the Minister never received an application from the
Claimant for a Licence for Suswa. It contends that the 20 July 2007 letter was not an
application for a Licence as it did not meet the mandatory requirements set out in

Regulation 4 of the GRR.*”’ For the Respondent:

[T]he 20 July 2007 letter sent by WalAm to the Minister applying
for an Authority states ... that it is an ‘application for geothermal
resources authority’, and WalAm explicitly acknowledged in point
7 of the work programme attached to it that WalAm would, at a later
stage, need to ‘apply for a Geothermal Resources License in
accordance with the Act’.**

 

Finally, the Respondent argues that under Kenyan law, estoppel cannot be invoked to defeat

the effects of an applicable statute (in this case the GRA and GRR).*”

TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s arguments that the Licence is a nullity. There is
some lack of clarity about the circumstances in which the Licence came to be issued by the
Minister in response, apparently, to the application for an authority to explore (see Section
IV.A above). The Tribunal has found that WalAm did wish to obtain both the Section 6(1)
authority to explore and a licence pursuant to Section 7 and that the Minister intended to
grant both and did so on the advice of the Permanent Secretary that WalAm had complied

in all respects with the GRA for those purposes (see paragraph 201 above).

The Tribunal does not consider that the existence of the statutory power in the Minister to
grant a licence is pre-conditioned upon the making of an application which complies in all
respects with the statutory requirements of form for such an application, or indeed an

application at all. There is good reason for having a statutory prescription of the form and

content for an application. It serves a purpose of ensuring that the Minister has information
which he should take into account in exercising his power. Thus a failure to provide
required information might give good grounds for the Minister to reject an application. It
does not follow that the Minister has no power to grant a licence where there is such non-
compliance, however trivial or fundamental. The language of the legislation does not
create such a conditionality for the existence of the power linked with the form of the
application — rather Section 7(2) of the GRA imposes a requirement on the applicant which

it must follow and could be waived by the Minister.

There could be good reasons why an application in the prescribed form would not be
necessary in particular circumstances, for example where all relevant information has been
provided to the Minister in some other form and the applicant adds only a request that a
licence be granted, the information having been provided. In the present case there was in
substance an application through the combination of the application for an authority to
explore and the exchanges between Mr Walji and the Ministry indicating willingness to
grant a licence and encouragement to WalAm. The Minister (on the advice of the
Permanent Secretary) considered that he had all the information he required from the

application for the authority to explore to be satisfied that a licence should be granted.

Accordingly the Tribunal finds that the Licence was valid when granted and rejects the

Respondent’s argument of nullity.

LEGALITY OF THE DECLARATION OF FORFEITURE

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES
(dd) Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Respondent had no basis to declare the Licence forfeited

because it did not breach any obligations under the Licence.*”

148

371.

First, the Claimant explains that at the time of the declaration of forfeiture, the Respondent
relied on a breach on the part of WalAm of an alleged obligation under the Licence to build
a power plant within five years. Notice of such breach was communicated to WalAm in
Mr Nyoike’s letter of 18 April 2012.**' The Claimant argues that the obligation to build a
power plant within 5 years is nowhere in the Licence or in Kenyan law. Accordingly, it
contends, the Respondent’s declaration of forfeiture on this basis is “meritless”**? and

“unlawful?

Second, the Claimant argues that it has not breached Article 9 of the Licence which states
that a licensee shall provide periodic written reports on the progress of operations under
the Licence. According to the Claimant, such reports are not required until “operations”
have in fact begun. It argues that the term “operations” in a geothermal context typically

refers to a phase when the geothermal plant is in production.***

Third, the Claimant argues that Respondent cannot rely on Section 11(1)(a) of the GRA or
Article 7(1)(a) of the Licence to justify the forfeiture of the Licence because WalAm did
not cease work “in or under the land” for a continuous period of six months.** The
Claimant disputes the Respondent’s interpretation of “in or under the land” as requiring
that physical work must be performed at the site.*° According to the Claimant, WalAm
routinely kept the Respondent appraised of significant development at Suswa and despite

its efforts, it was met with delays and obfuscation on the part of the Respondent.**”

Claimant’s Memorial, { 108. The Claimant explains that while in the April 2012 Letter the Minister alleged that
WalAm had breached Clauses 9 and 17 of the Licence, in its Forfeiture Notice the Minister revised its allegations
to contend that WalAm had beached Clauses 7 and 9 of the Licence by failing to build a power plant within five
years of geothermal resource exploration.

According to the Claimant, the words “in or under” must be read “merely as relational
connectors to indicate the resource to which the ‘work’ should relate. In other words,
assessing data, planning for development, conducting surveys—all with respect to the

development of the resource beneath the licensed area—must satisfy the requirement.”***

The Claimant also points to other greenfield geothermal projects in Kenya granted to
private developers where there were periods of at least six months where no drilling had

occurred and the applicable licences were not revoked.*”

However, if the Respondent’s interpretation of “work” is accepted, the Claimant submits
that Section 11(1)(a) of the GRA and Article 7(1)(a) of the Licence provide that the
Respondent cannot declare the Licence forfeited where it has provided written consent for
the licensee to cease work for a continuous period of six months. The Claimant submits
that in this case, the Respondent provided its written consent to allow WalAm to forego
“physical” work and drilling at the site until the conclusion of a PPA. The Tribunal
considers the documents relied on in its analysis of the Consent and Estoppel arguments

below.

Fourth, the Claimant argues that as a matter of Kenyan law and international law, the
Respondent cannot declare the Licence forfeited for any alleged breach that was in fact
caused by its own wrongdoing.*” According to the Claimant, if WalAm was in breach of
any obligation to conduct “physical” work in the form of drilling, the reason that it was not
able to do so was because the Respondent refused to negotiate the PPA.*' The Claimant
argues that “[f]rom March 2009, Respondent was aware that WalAm was ready to proceed
with the drilling of full-diameter wells, which would require a substantial financial
commitment from external investors and lenders. Respondent was further aware that, in

order to provide these funds, financiers required a PPA.”*” Therefore, according to the

Claimant, the Respondent was the sole cause of WalAm’s inability to progress to the

drilling phase.**

Fifth, the Claimant argues that the Respondent was estopped at the time of the Licence
from claiming that the GRA and the Licence require physical work. The Claimant submits
that the Respondent never stated or suggested to WalAm that failing to initiate work of a

physical nature, such as drilling, could lead to forfeiture of the Licence.™*

Sixth, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s declaration of forfeiture was not
proportional. According to the Claimant:

[T]he Minister had an obligation to exercise his discretion

reasonably so that his response was proportionate to any alleged

breach by WalAm. The declaration of forfeiture of WalAm’s License

as a result of delays caused by Respondent was plainly not a

proportional response to a breach that—if it had existed—WalAm

could have remedied with Respondent's cooperation.**
Finally, the Claimant argued that under the Kenyan Constitution, the Minister was required

to provide notice of the intention to exercise the power to declare the Licence forfeited

under Section 11(1)(a) of the GRA, which in the present case, was not done.*“°

(2) Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that even if the Licence was not void, it was lawfully declared to
be forfeited in accordance with Section 11 of the GRA and Clause 7(1) of the Licence
because the Claimant did not perform work “in and under the land’ at Suswa for a
continuous period of six months before forfeiture and otherwise failed to perform its

obligations under the Licence.*”

384.

The Respondent argues that it lawfully declared the Licence forfeited. Section 11(1) of the
GRA provides the grounds for the Minister of Energy to declare a geothermal licence

forfeited.*** The Tribunal sets out the section below.

The Respondent’s position is that the Claimant performed no work under the Licence. It
argues that none of the “efforts” described by the Claimant at paragraph 23 of its Memorial
constitute “work in or under the land” for the purposes of Section 11(1)(a) of the GRA.*”
According to the Respondent, the preparation of reports does not constitute work in and

under the land and none took place within six months of the forfeiture of the Licence.

According to the Respondent, the “work” that the Claimant needed to perform to keep the
Licence from being forfeited was to correspond to the “categories of ‘operations’ upon
which WalAm was required to report under Clause 9 of the Licence and to the activities
that WalAm was permitted to undertake under Clause I(1) of the Licence.” These
operations were physical in nature.*° For the Respondent, in order to retain the Licence,
the Claimant was required to drill to check whether there was a commercially exploitable

resource at Suswa and in the affirmative, to exploit it.**!

The Respondent argues that “[nJotwithstanding the exploration program to which it had
committed, over the entire five-year duration of the Licence, WalAm undertook no physical
studies, surveys, tests or measurements in the Suswa area, nor did it carry out any
exploratory drilling.”** Therefore, even accepting that WalAm did what it alleges, the
Minister was lawfully empowered to declare the Licence forfeited under Section 11(1)(a)

of the GRA because WalAm performed no work during the year preceding the forfeiture.**?

The Respondent submits that it lawfully declared the Licence to be forfeited on the basis

of WalAm’s non-performance. According to the Respondent, the Ministry had requested

WalAm to proceed with exploratory drilling on multiple occasions. It argues that as early
as 2009, the Ministry made it clear to WalAm that exploration wells must be drilled in
order to determine the overall project costs and to negotiate a PPA.*** The Respondent also

stresses that in 2011, Mr Nyoike insisted that WalAm proceed to drill.*°°

In sum, it is the Respondent’s position that WalAm did not perform any work in or under
the land in the six months prior to the forfeiture notice without the consent of the Minister

and for that reason, the Licence was lawfully declared to be forfeited.**°

The Respondent further argues that neither Kenya nor KPLC caused the Claimant’s failure
to perform under the Licence.**” In particular, the Respondent refutes the Claimant’s
contentions that the Government of Kenya and its refusal to negotiate a PPA in good faith

was an impediment to the continued progress of the project.***

First, the main reason that WalAm failed to perform under the Licence was that it did not

have the financial means to carry out the work it had undertaken to complete.*”

Second, while the Licence envisioned the conclusion of the PPA, it did not require that to
take place before exploratory drilling.“ According to the Respondent, WalAm’s assertion
that the negotiation of a PPA was a prerequisite for the drilling of wells is contradicted by

its own evidence and by industry practice.*"!

The Respondent also submits that the situations of other geothermal developers in Kenya
(Longonot and Akiira for example) are legally irrelevant. It argues that those projects

“involved greater commitment and progress by the developer, making it unsurprising that

even if the criteria had been met for the Minister to have a discretion to declare a licence

forfeited, no such declaration was made.”*

390. At the Hearing, the Respondent recognised that Article 47 of the Kenyan Constitution
confers a right on individuals to administrative action that is “procedurally fair”*° The
Respondent argues that the forfeiture was properly notified to the Claimant and thus
“procedurally fair”.*** The Respondent insists that it notified the Claimant in advance of
the forfeiture that it had “not carried out sufficient work at Suswa” and invited WalAm to
show cause why forfeiture should not occur on that basis, citing Clause 7 of the Licence,
which reflects Section 11 of the GRA.*® At the Hearing, the Respondent clarified its
interpretation of the “show cause” letter is as follows:

[T]he words in the second sentence of the second paragraph,
“WalAm has not carried out sufficient work at Suswa”--those
words, combined with the reference to Article 7 of the License is
sufficiently fair notice that the view has been taken that not enough
work has been done. And whether it says “at Suswa” or “in or and
under the land” or “in or under the land” is not material, in my

submission, because nothing of substance turns on the difference
between those words for the purposes of notice.

And secondly, that a reference to the entirety of Clause 7 includes
within it a reference to Clause 7(1)(a) just as much as 7(1)(b); and
that putting those two things together, that is fair notice of the view
that there’s not enough work being done, in the Ministry’s view, at
Suswa; and that forfeiture is a potential consequence of that; and
that that arises not only from the terms of this letter, but this letter,
viewed in the light of what preceded and followed.**
391. In addition, the Respondent argues that “[t]he forfeiture was published in the Gazette as

required by GRA s 11(3).”°"

TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

a

Validity of the Forfeiture of the Licence: Kenyan Law

The Claimant challenges the validity of the forfeiture, as a matter of Kenyan law, on a

number of distinct grounds.

a.

g.

The forfeiture was ultra vires the power because the Minister purported to act on
the basis of a “non-existent” or “invented” conduct: namely, that the Claimant had
failed to build a power plant within five years from “geothermal resource

exploration”.

The Minister was not entitled to rely on Section 11(1)(a) of the GRA, on which he

purported to rely.

In any event, the Minister had no basis on which to declare the Licence forfeited

pursuant to Section 11(1)(a) of the GRA.

Alternatively, that the Minister gave written consent to cessation of work or was
estopped from terminating the Licence on the basis of insufficient physical activity

on the site.

Alternatively, the exercise of the discretionary power in Section 1 1(1)(a) miscarried
because it was not exercised in good faith, or was not exercised reasonably, or was
disproportionate, or took into account irrelevant considerations, or failed to take

account of relevant considerations.

Alternatively, Kenya cannot rely on an alleged non-performance which was caused

by its own acts or omissions.

Alternatively, the Claimant was denied procedural fairness.

We will consider each of the grounds below. Three other contentions can be dealt with

summarily.

Firstly, the Claimant contends that the “declaration of forfeiture” was a “repudiatory

breach of the Licence”. This contractual terminology has no place in the determination of

the legality of the forfeiture of the Licence which is a public law issue that requires

155

395.

396.

397.

consideration of the existence and lawful or unlawful exercise of statutory power. Put
another way, the Licence was issued pursuant to and subject to the terms of the GRA. The
Licence and the GRA provide for the Minister to have the power to forfeit the Licence in
the circumstances specified in Clause 7 and Section 11 respectively. The concept of
forfeiture is a public law one (in contrast to, for example, express rights of termination in
a contract). If it was validly forfeited under those powers, the Claimant can have no
complaint. Indeed, the Claimant’s contentions that the forfeiture was invalid on public law
grounds of improper exercise of discretion and procedural unfairness rely on grounds that
would not be available if the Licence represented only a contract between the Claimant and

the Respondent and recognises that the questions in issue are public law issues.
Regulation 3(2) of the GRR provides:

A geothermal resources licence shall be accompanied by, or be

conditional upon, the execution of a contract (to be known as

“geothermal resources contract”) between the licensee and the

relevant Government department or other body designated by the

Minister for the purpose of providing for the utilization of the

geothermal resources.
No such contract was entered into either at the time of the grant of the Licence or
subsequently. However, the parties proceeded on the basis that, eventually, a PPA would

be entered into.

Secondly, the Claimant contends, that Kenya was “unjustly enriched” by the forfeiture.
This is not a recognised ground for challenge of an executive decision. As with the first
matter, it is an inappropriate application of civil law principles. In any event, if the Licence
was validly terminated in the exercise of a statutory power, no issue of “enrichment”, let

alone “unjust enrichment”, arises.

Thirdly, the Claimant contends that the forfeiture of the Licence was an unlawful taking,
contrary to the protection of property rights by Article 40(3) of the Constitution of Kenya.
If the Licence was validly terminated, there was no unlawful taking. The property right
was always subject to a condition that it could validly be forfeited pursuant to the legislative

scheme under which it was created. This aspect will be further considered in the context

156

398.

399.

400.

of international law rights. The reasoning in that section will apply to the cognate

Constitutional submission.

The central issue that arises in this regard is Kenya’s contention that the Licence required
the Claimant to carry out physical work “in and under the land”, the subject of the Licence.
It submits that no such “physical” work had been conducted for a considerable period. In
any event, it contends, no such work of any kind had been performed in the six months
before the notice of forfeiture. The reasoning below with respect to that issue applies to

the unlawful taking submission.

In its Reply, the Claimant contended that the decision to forfeit was not made in good faith.
In response, the Respondent submitted that given that the forfeiture was lawful, the
Minister’s motivation for declaring the forfeiture is irrelevant.*** The Respondent added
that in any event, “there is no proper factual basis for WalAm’s allegation that the Minister
was motivated by ‘a desire to take back the Suswa concession in order to allow its state-
owned GDC to develop the project.’ This is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory. As
explained by Paul Ngugi of GDC, ‘GDC has no interest in taking over private concessions’
— indeed, it ‘was created in order to attract private sector investment in Kenyan geothermal

energy’ .”3°

The Claimant further contends that the Minister’s decision to forfeit was not reasonable
and proportionate. In response, the Respondent argues that the forfeiture was both
reasonable and proportionate because it was based on WalAm’s own failure to undertake
any work in or under the land as required to avoid forfeiture. The Respondent explains that
these circumstances, revoking the Licence was a proportionate response.*” It also stresses
that the forfeiture was properly notified to the Claimant and that the Claimant had a
reasonable opportunity to understand the grounds for forfeiture and to react to them before

forfeiture was actually declared.*”

(2) The Forfeiture

To repeat, the GRA relevantly provides:
11. Forfeiture of licence
(1) The Minister may, by notice to the licensee, declare a licence to
be forfeited —

(a) if the licensee ceases work in or under the land the subject of the
licence during a continuous period of six months, without the written
consent of the Minister;

(b) if the licensee commits a breach or is in default of any provision
of this Act or of the regulations made thereunder or of any terms or
conditions of the licence and the Minister has caused a notice to be
served upon the licensee requiring him—

(i) in the case of a breach which, in the opinion of the Minister, is
capable of being repaired or made good, to repair or make good the
breach within a specified period;

(ii) in the case of a breach which, in the opinion of the Minister, is
not capable of being repaired or made good, to show cause within
a specified period why his licence should not be forfeited.

(2) The forfeiture of a licence under subsection (1) shall not affect

any liability already incurred by the licensee.

(3) The forfeiture of a licence under subsection (1) shall be

published in the Gazette.
The power to grant the Licence, found in Section 7 of the GRA provides that the Licence
“shall be in the prescribed form”. The form is set out in the First Schedule of the GRR.
By Regulation 3(1), a licence under Section 7 of the GRA “shall be negotiated on the basis
of the model licence set out in the First Schedule”.
The Licence granted to the Claimant contained the following relevant provisions:

1. The licensee is hereby granted the following exclusive rights:

(1) The right and privileges to enter, explore, drill for and extract,

produce, utilize and dispose geothermal steam and associated

geothermal resources in and under the land specified in the

Appendix 1) and shown on the map set forth in Appendix I hereof
(the ‘Licence Area’).

158

404.

405.

406.

407.

It is pertinent to note that this provision differs from that found in Article (1) of the First

Schedule to the GRR. Relevantly, the reference to “in and under the land” is added.
The Licence goes onto provide:

7. (1) The Minister may, by notice to the licensee, declare this
licence to be forfeited

(a) if the licensee wholly ceases work in or under the licence area
during a continuous period of six months, without the written
consent of the Minister;

(b) if the licensee commits a breach or is in default of any provision
of the Geothermal Resources Act or of the Geothermal Resources
Regulations, 1990 or of any terms or conditions of the licence and
the Minister has caused a notice to be served on the licensee
requiring the licensee -

(i) in case of a breach which, in the opinion of the Minister, is
capable of being repaired or made good, to repair or make good the
breach within a specified period;

(ii) in the case of a breach which, in the opinion of the Minister, is
not capable of being repaired or made good, to show cause why this
licence should not be forfeited.

Clause 7 of the Licence is substantially identical to Section 11(1)(a) of the GRA. It is
pertinent to note that the word “wholly” has been added before “ceases” in the Licence.
That word does not appear in Section 11(1)(a) of the GRA. Furthermore, the words “in or
under the licence area” replace the words “in or under the land the subject of the licence”

in the GRA. This does not constitute a material change.
The Licence further provides:

9. The licencee shall provide the Minister with periodic written
reports of the progress of operations under this licence as follows -

(1) on drilling operations, daily;

(2) on production operations, daily;

(3) on geophysical operations, monthly;
(4) on geothermal operations -

(a) within one month of the last day of March, June, September and
December covering the previous three months;

159

(b) within three months of the date of expiry or surrender of this
licence.

(5) Each report under paragraph (4) shall contain, in respect of the
period which it covers -

(a) details of the geothermal operations carried out and the factual
information obtained;

(b) a description of the area in which the licensee has operated;

(c) an account of the licensee’s expenditure on geothermal
operations;

(d) a map indicating all bores and other geothermal operations.

17. (1) The licensee shall notify the Minister, before operations
begin, of the name and address of the person resident in Kenya who
will supervise the operations under this licence and prior notice of
any subsequent change shall be given to the Minister.

(2) The licensee shall appoint an attorney resident in Kenya with
power of representation in all matters relating to this licence of
which appointment the Minister shall be notified before the
operations begin, and prior notice of any subsequent change shall
be given to the Minister.

408. On 30 October 2012, the Minister revoked the Licence by the following Notice:

1am concerned that despite having granted a Geothermal Resource
Licence to WalAm Geothermal Inc on 5th September 2007, there
have not been any apparent efforts made by the company to explore
and exploit geothermal resources in the Suswa geothermal field and
ultimately to construct a power plant. Under normal practice, it
takes five (5) years from geothermal resource exploration to
construction of a power plant which period has since been exceeded.
This amounts to a direct violation by the company of its obligations
under Clauses 7 and 9 of the said Licence.

Given this untenable position, I hereby exercise the powers
conferred on me by the Geothermal Resources Act, 1982 in Section
11 (1) (a) as the Minister for Energy and I forthwith revoke the
Licence granted to WalAm Geopower Inc with effect from the date
of this letter.

This decision shall hereinafter be published in the Kenya Gazette as
per the provisions of the Law.

160

409. As appears from the penultimate paragraph of this Notice, the Minister purported to

exercise the power set out in Section 11(1)(a) of the GRA. That was also the express basis

of the forfeiture as published in the Kenya Gazette:

410. The Forfeiture Notice was preceded by a Show Cause letter of 18 April 2012, which stated:

(3)

411. The Claimant’s contention that the decision to forfeit was beyond power turns on the

interpretation of the Forfeiture Notice, in the context of the Show Cause letter and the

FORFEITURE OF GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES LICENCE NO.
1/2007

PURSUANT to section 11 (1) (a) of the Geothermal Resources Act,
1982, the Geothermal Resource Licence No. 1/2007 granted to
WalaM Geothermal Inc. on Sth September, 2007, is forfeited, with
immediate effect, to the state.

Dated the Ist November, 2012.
KIRAITU MURUNGI,
Minister for Energy.

WalAm Geopower Inc. was granted the above captioned licence
covering Suswa Prospect on 5‘ September, 2007 for exploration,
appraisal and development of the geothermal resource therein to
construct a power plant (copy of licence attached for ease of
reference).

Under normal practice, it takes five years from geothermal resource
exploration to construction of such power plant. However, it is
noted that WalAm has not carried out sufficient work at Suswa
despite the license running close to five years now. Under the
circumstances, it will not be possible for the company to construct
the power plant within the five years. In addition, WalAm is also in
breach of Articles 9 and 17 of the license.

Pursuant to Article 7 of the license, the Minister for Energy intends
to declare Geothermal Resources License No.1/2007 as forfeited.
Notice is, therefore, hereby given to you to show cause why this
Licence should not be forfeited.

Yours Sincerely,
[Signature]

course of interaction between the parties. The proposition that the Minister was not entitled
to rely on Section 11(1)(a) of the GRA (or Clause 7(1)(a) of the Licence) relies on the same

interpretation.

The Claimant’s interpretation is based on the submission that, properly understood, the sole
basis for the forfeiture was the alleged failure to build a power plant within a five-year
period. The Claimant argues that the Forfeiture Notice “follows” what the Show Cause
letter had said and forfeited for failure to construct a power plant within five years. It
argued that the word “this” in the last sentence of the first paragraph of the Forfeiture Notice
is a reference back to the violation notified in the Show Cause letter.*” The Claimant points
out that nothing in the legislative scheme, nor in the Licence, created any such obligation.
This was in contrast with two other geothermal licences for other areas, which did contain

such an obligation.

As to the argument that the Forfeiture Notice should be interpreted as following the Show
Cause letter, or even in light of it, it is to be noted that the Minister forfeiture was expressly
based on the exercise of the power under Section 11(1)(a) of the GRA. That power is not
preconditioned upon there having been a show cause notice. Further, the Forfeiture Notice
does not refer to the Show Cause letter. There is no reason to interpret the forfeiture notice
other than in its terms and in light of the sections of the Licence and the GRA to which it
refers. The Show Cause letter, as we will show, invoked a different power. The broader
context, including the Show Cause letter, is, however, material to a number of the public

law grounds invoked by the Claimant.

We have set out the Forfeiture Notice above. The Claimant contends that the last sentence

of the first paragraph, which commences:
This amounts to a direct violation ...
refers to the immediately preceding sentence, which refers to the five-year period.

The Tribunal is of the view that confining the word “this” to what immediately precedes it

is not a reasonable interpretation of the Notice. That is so for a number of reasons.

420.

First, the very first sentence of the Notice contains a reference to building a power plant,
but does so in a broader context:

[T]here have not been any apparent efforts made by the company to

explore and exploit geothermal resources in the Suswa geothermal

field and ultimately to construct a power plant.
The next sentence, upon which the Claimant focuses, elaborates the concluding clause:
“ultimately to construct a power plant’. The sentence on which the Claimant relies does
not stand alone but refers back to a broader allegation of default, namely the absence of
“apparent efforts ... to explore and exploit’. Furthermore, the words “ultimately to
construct” are more consistent with an event that would have occurred in the future, rather
than an event whose time has passed.

Secondly, the sentence commencing: “[t]his amounts to ...” itself concludes with a
reference to Clauses 7 and 9 of the Licence. The reference to Clause 7 could, arguably, be
confined to Section 11(1)(b), ifread only in the context of the Show Cause letter — to which
we will return. However, that cannot be said with respect to the reference to Clause 9,
which concerns reporting requirements of a broader nature. That reference is much more
clearly related to the absence of “apparent efforts ... to explore and exploit geothermal

resources”. Any such “efforts” should have been the subject of reports under Clause 9.

Thirdly, the next paragraph goes on to state, expressly, that the power being exercised is
the power under Section 11(1)(a). In its terms, that power is based on a failure to do work
in or under the land that continued for a six-month period. That has no, or at best a tenuous,
relationship to the alleged failure to build a power plant within five years, but would have
a relationship with the absence of “any efforts to explore and exploit’. The failure to do
any “work on the ground” was expressly raised in the discussions in February/March 2011
as set out in the Section IV, to which we will refer further below, in our consideration of
the grounds of challenge to the Termination decision.

As we have noted, the Claimant sought to invoke the Show Cause letter for its interpretation
of the Forfeiture Notice. The focus of that earlier communication is on the failure to build
a power plant within five years. However, that is not the sole focus. It also states: “Walam

has not carried out sufficient work at Suswa’”. That broad language is not confined to

163

421.

422.

423.

424.

425.

426.

completing the construction of a power plant. Further, breaches of Clauses 9 and 17 are

also alleged.

On its face, the Show Cause letter is a notice under Section 11(1)(b) and Clause 7(1)(b).
This is strongly suggested by the concluding statement that the Minister intends to declare
(the Licence) forfeited and invites the Claimant to “show cause” why that should not be
done. The express reference to the fact that “it will not be possible ... to construct the
power plant within five years” appears to be a reference to a matter that is not curable and

therefore intended to be a reference to Clause 7(1)(b)(ii).

The structure of the Show Cause letter, indeed its very existence, cannot be interpreted as

relying on Clause 7(1)(a). It is only consistent with Clause 7(1)(b).

The reference to “WalAm has not carried out sufficient work at Suswa’” is not, of itself
sufficient to constitute a reference to Clause 7(1)(a). In any event, that basis for the
forfeiture does not lead to a request to “show cause”. Clause 7(1)(a) does not require any

further notice.

It is pertinent to note how the reference in the Show Cause letter (“WalAm has not carried
out sufficient work’) is reflected in the Forfeiture Notice in an expanded form:

[T]here have not been any apparent efforts made by the company to

explore and exploit geothermal resources.
Whatever may have been the confines of the Show Cause letter, the Forfeiture Notice states
a specific basis for the decision. The Tribunal rejects the ultra vires challenge to the
validity of the Forfeiture Notice to the effect that the reason for forfeiture was the failure
to build the power plant within five years. The invocation of Section 11(1)(a) is express
and is confirmed in the publication of the Notice in the Gazette, which gives the forfeiture
effect. The terminology referring to construction of a power plant in the termination notice
itself — “and ultimately to construct a power plant” — abandons any suggestion that the

plant should have been constructed by the time of the forfeiture.

For the same reasons, we reject the Claimant’s contention that, on procedural fairness
grounds, Kenya is not entitled to rely on Section 11(1)(a) or Clause 7(1)(a). Before this

Tribunal, Kenya did not rely on the failure to build a power plant within five years as a

164

427.

428.

429.

justification for the forfeiture. However, as we have shown, on the proper interpretation of

the Notice, that was not what Kenya purported to do on 30 October 2012.

We reject the Claimant’s contention that there was no reliance on Section 11(1)(a) on any
basis other than the alleged five-year obligation to build a power plant. The five-year
reference bears no relationship to the six-month passage of time referred to in that
provision. The express reference to Section 11(1)(a) in both the Notice, and in the Gazette,
is itself sufficient to reach that conclusion. Reading the whole of the Forfeiture Notice, in
its context, affirms that the basis of the decision was the failure to do any physical work in

or under the land.

That, however, does not resolve further challenges raised by the Claimant: including
whether there was a proper factual basis for a Section 11(1)(a) forfeiture, reasonableness,

relevant considerations and procedural fairness grounds.

(4) The Factual basis

As noted above, the Claimant contended that the Minister had no factual basis for a Section
11(1)(a) finding, because of the work the Claimant had done. The circumstances in which
a Ministerial decision can be set aside on the basis that there was no factual basis for it, are
limited in administrative law jurisprudence. The Tribunal was not provided with evidence
of that character. In any event, as appears from the detail in Section IV, particularly in the
respective Work Programs we discuss, WalAm had not undertaken any physical work on
the ground for a substantial period of time. On the evidence before us, the last site visit by
a WalAm employee was in November 2008, when Mr Laing accompanied Geothermal

Resources to the area.*”

373 Between 12-13 December 2009 SKM and Howard Humphreys (an experienced local engineering company retained
to jointly produce an infrastructure report on road conditions and water sources for Suswa, see [C-024], Howard
Humphreys (East Africa) Limited and Sinclair Knight Merz, Suswa Geothermal Concession Report on Access
Road Condition and Source of Water for Drilling Programme, Rev. 4, November 2010, p. 2) conducted a two-
day site visit to Suswa to survey road conditions, find a possible access route, and investigate potential water
supply sources for the drilling program. It was not suggested by the Claimant that this was physical work on the
ground.

165

430.

431.

432.

433.

In closing submissions,*” counsel for WalAm identified three items of work which were
described as “work [...] done in 2012”, it being common ground that this was the relevant
period to consider whether anything was done “in and under the land”. No other work was
done in the six months before the Notice of Termination. Unless one of these constituted
“work” within the meaning of Section 11(1)(a) and Clause 7(1)(a), the factual basis for

termination is established.

The first matter relied on is “WalAm sends an EOI for the GRMF grant.”* The two
documents relied on are both dated 2 November 2012, that is, after the date of the Forfeiture
Notice. No doubt some preparatory work was done before that, but we have no evidence

about that.

The second matter relied on is: “WalAm works with SKM on updates to the Development
Plan” >” In April 2012 WalAm reported to Mr Nyoike that it had engaged SKM “to bring
capital expenditures up to date”*”’. Version 9 of the SKM Development Plan*’ is dated
18 April 2013. While this document was clearly developed over time, the Claimant relied
only on the fact that it was instructing SKM to update it and did not suggest that any “work”
proposed on this Plan had actually been undertaken during the six months before the
forfeiture. On the contrary, the Development Plan showed that in terms of feasibility study,

exploration and drilling preparation, that was all still to come.*”

The third matter relied on is: “WalAm engages in discussions with KPLC to conclude a

PPA”>*° Two documents are referred to. The first is an email chain between 27 July 2012

and 7 September 2012.**! It concerns the provision by KPLC of a draft PPA. The second
is Mr Walji’s email of 1 November 2012 to Mr Njoroge, two days after forfeiture**?
reporting that he had spoken to Ms Meso who had said that feedback on the mark-up of the
draft PPA was scheduled to be done.

It is certainly the case, as appears from our detailed chronology in Section IV, WalAm was,
still in 2012, trying to progress the discussion of the PPA. As the Claimant accepted in
closing submissions in relation to all the matters relied on as having been done in 2012
“none of this work has anybody out on the Suswa property; that is clear.”** The relevant

facts are not in contention.

(5) The meaning of “in or under the land” and “in or under the license area”

The determination of the issue posed by the Claimant’s contentions in this regard turns on
the interpretation of the words “in or under the land” in Section 11(1)(a) of the GRA and

“in or under the license area” in Clause 7(1)(a) of the Licence.

Kenya contends that either formulation requires physical acts at the land. Communications
and drafting offsite involving applications for funds, development of plans or negotiations
for sale of electricity are not of that character. The Claimant argues that the phrase “in or
under the land” loosely refers to the resource and that “the point of the License is to develop
that resource and exploit it.”*** The Claimant says that this does mean that the licensee
must “do whatever is necessary to develop that resource” and that the land is to be exploited
meaning that the resource “needs to be taken out of the ground and used to generate

electricity.” **°

The Claimant’s interpretation is less precise and might still comprehend the need for

physical work but could allow for the work required to vary from time to time. That

441,

uncertainty and vagueness, and the fact that there might be no visibility to the licensor of

development weighs against that construction.

On the other hand the textual basis for Kenya’s submission is compelling. The references
to “land” and “licence area’ strongly indicate a physical dimension. Similarly, the
propositions “in” and “under” involve a physical relationship between the conduct and
land. This cannot be understood to be satisfied by a general association, as would be the

case if a formulation such as “in relation to” had been adopted.

This conclusion is reinforced by the identity between the Clause 7(1)(a) formulation of “in
or under the licence area” and the Clause 1(1) statement of the “exclusive rights”, which
the licence confers. That is expressed to be a right to conduct various physical acts “in and
under the land”. Those acts are: “to enter, explore, drill for and extract, produce, utilize
and dispose geothermal steam and associated geothermal resources”. The “rights”
conferred by the licence under Section 8 of the GRA are also referable to physical activity
occurring in the licence area or with respect to ancillary operations, water supply and

transport to the area: “to enter upon the land” “to bore and extract” “to drill and construct”

ete.

The licence so conferred, renders lawful physical acts which would otherwise be illegal as
a trespass or as an infringement of the property rights in geothermal resources, vested in
the Government of Kenya by Section 3 of the GRA. There is therefore a strong reason to
interpret the forfeiture condition in Section 11(1)(a) of the GRA as dependent on a failure
to exercise the rights granted by the licence; in other words to read Section! 1(1)(a)
consonantly with Section 8(1). It would be consistent with the object and purpose of the
Act and of the grant of the licence, that a failure to exploit the licence could give rise to
forfeiture in specified circumstances, and on a proper interpretation of those provisions,

such exploitation is contemplated as necessarily involving physical activity.

The Claimant says that this interpretation is narrow and literal. It is not — it is an
interpretation which reads the forfeiture provision in the context of, and consistent with,
the object and purpose of the licence and the rights granted thereunder. The formulation
“in and under the land” in Clause 7 (1)(a) and the cognate formulation in Section 11(1)(a)

require physical activity at the site — the right to forfeit arises where there has been a failure

168

for six months on the part of the licensee to do anything in exercise of the right and for

which it required the authority of the licence to do.

Furthermore, we have set out above the facts in support of the Respondent’s contention
that no relevant work was carried out during the six-month period (see paragraphs
above). The Claimant accepted that if the Tribunal adopted the Respondent’s

interpretation, the Claimant could not contend that the condition was satisfied.**°

This conclusion is reinforced by the statement in the Forfeiture Notice alleging a breach of
Clause 9 of the Licence. Although that is not said to be the basis for the forfeiture decision,
it is relevant to the stated basis under Clause 7(1)(a). Clause 9 requires periodic written

reports, some daily, some monthly and some quarterly.

Although WalAm provided information on what it had done from time to time, the detail
required by Article 9 was never provided in the form requested, let alone at the times

required.
We uphold the interpretation advanced by the Respondent. On this basis, the factual
foundation for the decision to exercise the discretion to forfeit has been established. We

reject the Claimant’s contention that it was not.

(6) The Exercise of the Discretion

The Claimant challenges the Minister’s decision to forfeit the Licence on a number of
overlapping grounds. The relevant common law principles of administrative law are
reinforced by Article 47 of the Constitution of Kenya, which provides:

Article 47

(1) Every person has the right to administrative action that is
expeditious, efficient, lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair.

(2) If a right ... of a person has been or is likely to be adversely
affected by administrative action, the person has the right to be
given written reasons for the action.

386 Transcript D6:P1634:L1 1-14 (Benson) (“[I]f their construction of ‘in and under the land’ is right, I lose this whole
point, so I’m not suggesting that this would satisfy their test.”).

169

447.

448.

449,

450.

The parties did not rely on the provisions of the Fair Administrative Action Act 2015. It

was not in force at the date of forfeiture.

The following general statement of the principles of judicial review of executive discretion
under the Kenyan Constitution, and the common law of Kenya, provides an overview:
It is however trite that discretion must be exercised in good faith and
reasonably. It is now clear that even in the exercise of what may
appear to be prima facie absolute discretion conferred on the
executive the Court may interfere. The Court can therefore intervene
in the following situations: (1) where there is an abuse of discretion;
(2) where the decision-maker exercises discretion for an improper
purpose; (3) where the decision-maker is in breach of the duty to act
fairly; (4) where the decision-maker has failed to exercise statutory
discretion reasonably; (5) where the decision-maker acts in a
manner to frustrate the purpose of the Act donating the power; (6)
where the decision-maker fetters the discretion given; (7) where the
decision-maker fails to exercise discretion; (8) where the decision-
matker is irrational and unreasonable.*"

(7) Good Faith

One of the grounds for the Claimant’s challenge can be dealt with shortly. In the pleadings
it asserted that the decision to terminate was not made in good faith. No such proposition
was put to any witness. Mr Nyoike gave evidence about the process by which the decision
was reached by the Minister, Mr Nyoike’s own involvement and the taking of advice from
the Attorney-General. Any allegation of lack of good faith would have had to be put to
him. It was not. The Tribunal does not, in any event, consider that any aspect of the
evidence before us could have supported a suggestion of bad faith. We have set out the

relevant facts above.

The Ministry had expressed its frustration with the lack of progress under the Licence on a
number of occasions. It is sufficient to refer to the MOE response to the 2011 Work

Program and the attendant discussions. We have found that this process occurred after the

MOE had indicated dissatisfaction with the lack of work on the ground and Mr Nyoike had

threatened loss of the Licence.

After requiring that the first draft of the document be amended to add timelines and budgets,
the revised work plan was approved. However, that approval was subject to an express
condition that the Program, including the timetable, must be “strictly adhered to”. The
breach subsequently relied on in the Forfeiture Notice was already apparent. This further

indulgence on the part of the MOE is inconsistent with the allegation of bad faith.

There is no basis for a finding that the decision to forfeit under Section 11(1)(a) and Clause

7(1)(a) was not made in good faith. We reject this ground.

(8) Reasonableness/Proportionality

The factual inquiries relevant to these two forms of illegality are closely related. It is

convenient to treat them together.

The relevant principles are not in contention. It is only necessary to refer to two of the

authorities to which the Claimant drew the Tribunal’s attention.

In Patrick Kariungi v Commissioner of Police & Another, High Court at Nairobi, JR Misc.
Civil Application No. 193 of 2012, Judgment, 15 July 2014,*** the High Court at Nairobi

referred with approval at paragraph 32 to the following:

In Republic vs. Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya
Ex Parte Vipichandra Bhatt T/A J V Bhatt & Company Nairobi
HCMA No. 285 of 2006, the Court held:

“Tf a tribunal whose jurisdiction was limited by statute or subsidiary
legislation mistook the law applicable to the facts as it had found
then it must have asked itself the wrong question, i.e. one into which
it was not empowered to inquire and so had no jurisdiction to
determine. Its purported determination not being a ‘determination’
within the meaning of empowering legislation was accordingly a
nullity ... Error of law by a public body is a good ground for judicial
review. An administrative or executive authority entrusted with the
exercise of a discretion must direct itself properly in law ... It is

axiomatic that that statutory power can only be exercised validly if
they are exercised reasonably. No statute can ever allow anyone on
whom it confers a power to exercise such power arbitrarily and
capriciously or in bad faith.”*°

456. In Republic v Kenya National Examinations Council Ex-Parte Charles Maina Wanjihia &
Another, High Court at Nairobi, Misc. Application No. 328 of 2015, Judgment, 20 January
2016,°” the High court at Nairobi stated, with reference to the facts of that case:

It appears on the authorities to which we are referred, that the
Kenyan concept of ‘reasonableness’ in administrative law requires
a finding that the Ministerial action was ‘arbitrary or capricious’.
This is an objective test which does not involve review of the events,
an important demarcation in the principles of judicial review of
administrative decision making.*'

457. The Tribunal has set out the significance of projects such as that under consideration to the
people of Kenya in our section on Geothermal Development in Kenya. We have referred
to a number of official reports, including Least Cost Power Development Plan 2010-2030,
Kenya Vision 2030 Strategy, and the first Medium Term Plan 2012-2016. The development
of public policy over a period of time, culminating in these plans, highlights the significant
national interest involved in the ambitious plan for expanding geothermal capacity twenty-
fold, to fill what is described as an electricity deficit in the nation. This is the background
against which the reasonableness of the decision to terminate the Licence in this case must
be assessed. Over a period of more than five years the Claimant had spent a significant
amount of money on consultants and had developed the outline of a project. It had not
done anything to implement that project. It had manifested an inability to raise the funds
required to progress the project beyond the project outline stage and, indeed, had not paid

its last consultant because it couldn’t.

458. The process of growing frustration on the part of Kenya, is best expressed in Mr Nyoike’s

internal note of 7 March 2011, with respect to an application for a VAT exemption: “[t]his

is another delaying tactic. It is not prudent to have WalAm sit on this area doing virtually

nothing.” As we have noted in Section IV, he explained in his witness statement that his

concern and frustration was based on Kenya’s twenty-year rolling plan to make geothermal

energy a major source of electricity for sale to the national grid.

The key events leading to the MOE losing confidence in WalAm’s capacity to deliver are

set out in the Section IV, including:

a.

Mr Nyoike asked Mr Walji before the licence was granted to affirm WalAm’s

capacity to deliver and see the project through and received that assurance.

The approval of the original Work Program on 7 September 2007 required a “two
phased exploration program’, with the second phase consisting of two exploration
wells. The proposed condition that drilling would occur after a memorandum of
understanding for a PPA with KPLC — only a memorandum of understanding not a
PPA — was expressly removed by the MOE from the Authority as issued. Mr Walji
noticed that that had occurred. The undertaking to drill two exploration wells was

unconditional.

The GeothermEx report proposed a number of full diameter wells to establish
feasibility of the project. This increased the funds required for the exploratory
phase significantly. In the subsequent discussion in and after March 2009, WalAm
said it required a “mutually agreed PPA” to raise the requisite funds. In response
Mr Nyoike wrote on 29 September 2009:

Walam obtained the license ... on full understanding that the

Company has the necessary financial and technical capability to
fulfill the power development.

and

The Ministry cannot therefore determine the project costs for
WalAm or engage in entering Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)
with Walam unless steam wells have been drilled.

WalAm will need to drill at least three (3) geothermal wells which
will provide the required information on the capacity of power to be
generated and therefore making it possible to negotiate fruitfully for
PPA with [KPLC].

173

460.

461.

462.

d. The next significant communication from WalAm was a letter to the Minister of
30 August 2010 — almost a year later. Mr Walji acknowledged: “[i]t may seem that
WalAm has not been doing much work in Kenya.” But he assured the Minister that
the work of the consultants “will now lead to WalAm being able to drill as per

schedule”.

e. In and around March 2011, WalAm presented its new Work Program. The MOE
sent back the first draft in order to specify timetables and budgets for the phases
proposed. During this period Mr Nyoike warned or threatened that the Licence
would be withdrawn because WalAm had not done enough “work on the ground”.
Subsequently, he explained to a WalAm representative that what he had in mind at
that stage was infrastructure in roads and water that were a prerequisite for

exploratory drilling rather than drilling itself.

f. On 23 March 2011, Mr Nyoike approved an amended Work Program with separate
timelines for water and road development by December 2011 and split program for
drilling three wells, the first of which was by December 2011 and the next two by
July 2012. He stated expressly that the approval was based on “the understanding
that the schedule will be strictly adhered to.” The letter advised WalAm to pursue
PPA negotiations with KPLC.

Far from adhering to its own proposed timetable, nothing of the character required for work
on the ground occurred before the forfeiture. WalAm’s inability to deliver was reinforced

by its failure to engage in a competent manner with KPLC.

We have set out in Section IV the inability of WalAm to raise the US$3 million which it
thought necessary to negotiate a final PPA. We have also set out the inability of WalAm
to provide KPLC with the information which was essential for the critical commercial
components of a PPA. The evidence of the witnesses from KPLC before us was an

indictment of WalAm’s commercial competence.

Ms Niagi stated that the key elements were project specific and of a kind that only the
developer could provide. As Mr Shibuyanga pointed out, KPLC practice required an

applicant to provide a tariff proposal together with its financial model, so that the proposal

174

463.

464.

465.

could be tested. That required the developer to identify its infrastructure requirements,
timeline for construction and associated costs.*”? As we have noted, Ms Nijagi affirmed
that KPLC never received a financial model. Indeed, she noted that it had never received
the SKM Report.*” As late as 28 August 2012 Ms Meso wrote pointing out that KPLC
could not enter the “specific details describing your plant’. The key components of the
formula in the schedule for the computation of the tariff, notably the capacity charge, could
only be provided by WalAm. It alone had, or should have had, information on the costs of
the development, including the power plant. Mr Walji accepted that this information was
necessary. Over a period of months of exchanges with KPLC, between the Show Cause

Notice and the Forfeiture Notice, nothing was provided.

In view of this long history of inability to deliver, or to establish that it could acquire the
financial resources to do so, Kenya’s decision to terminate the Licence was not

unreasonable.

The alternative test of “proportionality” does not involve a clearly distinct test. The same
range of facts referred to above on “reasonableness” are relevant. It was entirely open to
the Government of Kenya to decide that the Claimant would not be able to develop this
resource within a reasonable time, if at all. In view of the significance of such development
in the national interest and the opportunities that Kenya had given WalAm to show that it

could deliver, termination was a proportionate response to that failure.

(9) Irrelevant Considerations

It is well established that the exercise of a Ministerial discretion may be found to have
miscarried if the Minister took into account irrelevant considerations or failed to take into
account relevant considerations. The position is the same if the Minister asks himself the

wrong question, as may appear from the reasons given.*”

466. The Kenyan authorities to which we were referred include Wagunza*** where the Court
referred, at paragraph 26, with approval, to the judgment in Republic v The Commissioner
of Lands Ex parte Lake Flowers Limited Nairobi HCMISC, Application No. 123 of 1998,

to the following effect:

The High Court has the same power as the High Court in England
up to 1977 and much more because it has the exceptional heritage
of a written Constitution and the doctrines of the common law and
equity in so far as they are applicable and the Courts must resist the
temptation to try and contain judicial review in a strait jacket ...
Although judicial review has been bequeathed to us with defined
interventions namely illegality, irrationality and impropriety of
procedure the intervention has been extended using the principle of
proportionality ... The court will be called upon to intervene in
situations where authorities and persons act in bad faith, abuse
power, fail to take into account relevant considerations in the
decision making or take into account irrelevant considerations or
act contrary to legitimate expectations ...

467. The Court went on to state at paragraph 40:

Concerning irrelevant considerations, where a body takes account
of irrelevant considerations, any decision arrived at becomes
unlawful. Unlawful behaviour might be constituted by (i) an
outright refusal to consider the relevant matter; (ii) a misdirection
on a point of law; (iii) taking into account some wholly irrelevant
or extraneous consideration; and (iv) wholly omitting to take into
account a relevant consideration.

468. The Court concluded on the facts of that case at paragraph 43:

Therefore in meting out punishment the Respondent was expected to
exercise its discretion reasonably and not arbitrarily and
capriciously or in bad faith. The law is that in the ordinary way and
particularly in cases, which affect life liberty or property, those in
authority should give reasons and if they give none the court may
infer that they had no good reasons. Similarly where the reason
given is not one of the reasons upon which they are legally entitled
to act, the Court is entitled to intervene since their action would then
be based an irrelevant matter. In this case the Respondents gave no
reason at all for imposing different sentences on the applicants from
those imposed on fellow “key suspects” and in default of such

472.

reasons this Court is properly entitled to infer that there were no
good reasons for imposing such sentences on the applicants or that
the sentences were based on irrelevant matters.
It is relevant to point out that the case before this Tribunal does not involve the human

rights dimension in Wagunza.

As we have indicated, in dealing with the ultra vires arguments above, Kenya did not
terminate for failure to build a power plant within five years. It did make reference to the
power plant aspect which had been the focus of the Show Cause letter. That this was a
matter in the mind of the Minister’s closest advisor, Permanent Secretary Nyoike, is shown

by the prominence of that matter in his Show Cause letter.

However, the way in which the power plant was referred to in the Forfeiture Notice was
quite different to the Show Cause latter. It said “ultimately to construct a power plant”.
The reason for the forfeiture, as we have determined, was the fact that “no apparent efforts
to explore and exploit the geothermal resources” had been made. The fact that “‘u/timately”
that would have led to a power plant reflects the final purpose of the Licence. In this

context it is not an irrelevant consideration.

There is a further exception to invalidity based on a finding that the irrelevant consideration
“played no significant part in the decision-making exercise’. If we had found that the
refence to the power plant was an irrelevant consideration, we would have applied this
exception. Our interpretation of the Forfeiture Notice leads to the conclusion that the
reference to building a power plant within five years played no significant part in the
decision to forfeit under Section 11(1)(a). This conclusion is reinforced by the background
context of communications between WalAm and the MOE as well as the internal
documentation of the MOE. Many aspects of WalAm’s actual and proposed conduct were
considered, especially in the communications about the two Work Programs of 2007 and
2011. On no occasion was there any reference to the construction of the power plant.
Perhaps the best example is the series of exchanges in February/March 2011 in the context

of the Work Program. There was an express threat of termination of the Licence on the

396 [RL-158], R(FDA) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2013] 1 WLR 444, 67.

177

basis of inadequate work on the ground, where the sole focus was water and road

infrastructure and drilling.

473. Kenya invoked authority which suggests that the existence of an irrelevant consideration
does not result in a miscarriage of the discretion, if the result would have been the same,

on the basis of the relevant considerations that were taken into account.*””

474. One of the relevant cases on this basis of exclusion expresses the applicable test with
stringency “probability is not enough ... [t]he defendant would have to show that the
decision would inevitably have been the same”.*** In a later case, one judge expressed the
test in terms of whether the decision maker “would necessarily have reached the same
result”? a second adopted the same formulation without the word “necessarily” and the
third agreed with them both. A text writer adopts a similar level of conviction by adopting
the word “undoubtedly” and adds an additional criterion “and there is clear countervailing

public interest in not quashing the decision” ."!

475. However, these alternative formulations should now be understood in the light of the most
recent survey of this line of authority by the Court of Appeal in R(FDA) supra. Neuberger
MR (as his Lordship then was) emphasised that this exclusion was “exceptional” and
adopted the formulation; “it would be pointless to require the decision-maker to reconsider
the question afresh, because he would reach the same answer.”** His Lordship suggested
that this may be “a theoretical point” if the Secretary of State could not show that the

irrelevant consideration was “not a significant factor” “4

His Lordship’s reasoning, when finally disposing of the case is pertinent for present

purposes:

[78] ... this is one of those relatively rare cases, when the court
could properly (and therefore should) conclude, that even though
the decision-maker took a legally irrelevant factor into account, and
it was a “ substantial” (as opposed to an “insignificant” ) factor, it
is a factor which can be “disentangled” from the other, valid,
reasons for the decision, and in the light of those reasons, the
decision should stand as it plainly would have been the same if the
factor had not been taken into account.

  

It is common ground that there is no Kenyan authority that adopts this limited exception to
the usual conclusion of invalidity, when an irrelevant consideration has been taken into
account. Nevertheless, as the Respondent submits, Kenyan administrative law makes

frequent reference to English precedent.

The Claimant drew our attention to one authority which stated, in a natural justice context,
that it is not material that the same decision would have been made.“ The elements are
different in a context where irrelevant considerations have been taken into account, where
a balancing exercise may be appropriate. There is no equivalent balancing consideration

in the procedural fairness context.

The Respondent has reinforced its submission with reference to the process of
reconsideration of the decision to terminate in this case. Again, it is common ground that
there is no Kenyan authority directly in point. The Respondent does refer to a natural
justice case where reconsideration was relied on.“ Again that context is quite different,

as procedural fairness always requires an assessment of the full course of conduct.

In the present case, as the Respondent points out, the Claimant’s request for reconsideration

of 5 December 2012 made no reference to the failure to construct a power plant within five

years. Nor, does the point by point rejection by the Respondent of that request make any
such reference.*”’ This documented process does enable the Tribunal to draw the inference
that the Claimant understood that the irrelevant consideration was not their real problem.
More significantly, it enables the Tribunal more confidently to reach the conclusion that

the same decision would have been made, even on an “inevitably” or “undoubtedly” test.

The Claimant contends that the reconsideration was not “meaningful”. We see no evidence
of that. Each point made was addressed. In any event, no such proposition was put to
Mr Nyoike in cross-examination. A proposition which challenged his integrity, should

have been put.

It is clear that the Ministry of Energy had long been concerned with the failure of WalAm
to pursue the development of the Licence. The reliance on the failure to do so in the six
months prior to the Forfeiture Notice — the period stipulated in Section 11(1)(a) — is

consistent with this concern.

Perhaps the clearest statement of the concern is found in the letter of 23 March 2012, by
which Mr Nyoike accepted the commitment to the detailed timetable set out in the Work
Plan put forward by WalAm. He emphasised that he accepted the implicit assurance that
WalAm had the necessary resources and the promised dates — which he marginally
amended — to be achieved. The tone of this letter is “This is your last chance”. There is
nothing in this correspondence placing any reliance on any obligation to build a power
plant within five years. Indeed, as further explained in oral evidence, it is quite inconsistent

with any such factor being regarded as significant.

If it were necessary to do so, the Tribunal would find that, even if the power plant reference
was a significant relevant consideration, without it the result would have been the same.
(10) Relevant Considerations

The obverse of the irrelevant considerations ground is the failure to take into account

relevant considerations. Similar principles apply.

407 See [C-084]/[KE-84], Letter from Mr Maherab Walji (WalAm) to Hon Minister Kiraitu Murungi (MOE),
5 December 2012 and [C-086]/[KE-87], Email from Mr Patrick Nyoike (MOE) to Mr Maherab Walji (WalAm),

The Claimant invokes that ground on the basis that the Minister failed to take into account
the legitimate expectations of the Claimant. They refer to two cases in support of the
content of relevant considerations, Keroche Industries Limited v Kenya Revenue Authority
[2007] eKLR* and Republic v The Agriculture Fisheries and Food Authority [2017]
eKLR,*” the latter applying the former. In Keroche,*"* the Court said:

[Flailure to consider a legitimate expectation is a failure to consider

a relevant consideration and this would in turn call for the courts

intervention in assuming jurisdiction and giving the necessary

relief.
Whether there was an “expectation” which can be described as “legitimate” is an issue of
fact. The expectation on which the Claimant now relies arises from its repeated statements
that it needed a PPA before it could raise the funds for the infrastructure required to

progress the project.

We have set out the entire litany of these statements in Section IV. It is unnecessary to
repeat them. We rely on the findings made several times in that section to the effect that
WalAm had no basis for any expectation that Kenya agreed to any such connection. That

was the point of the frequent repetition.

As we have pointed out none of the references asserted that there was an agreement, until
the lawyers became involved. The only reference to an “agreement” is in the response of
23 April 2012 to the Show Cause letter. Subsequent references are to an “understanding”,

as in the letter of 26 July 2012 to KPLC.

Originally the demand was for an memorandum of understanding, then for a Term Sheet
and finally for a PPA often referred to as “bankable”. The MOE expressly rejected this
condition in Mr Nyoike’s letter of 29 September 2009, as the project costs could not be
determined until WalAm had drilled exploratory wells. This reason is reflected in the later

explanation by KPLC officers that no tariff structure could be negotiated until the costs of

the project had been determined, including the power plant. On these matters the ball was

in WalAm’s court. It remained there throughout.

The MOE removed WalAm’s reference to a PPA condition in its Application, when issuing
the original Authority to Explore. As we have found, Mr Walji was well aware that this
had happened. Similarly when approving the 2011 Work Program, Mr Nyoike did not adopt
WalAm’s timetable reference to a PPA, but simply referred it to KPLC for negotiations.
Far from accepting any such relationship, he required “strict adherence” to a timetable of

works which made no provision for any interconnection with a PPA.

On no occasion did any arm of the Government of Kenya give any indication that WalAm
did not have to proceed with physical activity in or under the land until a PPA had been
concluded. There was no basis for any expectation that it could. Indeed, on the evidence
it is clear that WalAm had no such expectation, let alone a legitimate one, that it could
proceed without undertaking any substantial work pending finalisation of a PPA and the

subsequent raising of funds.

The inability of WalAm to raise the necessary risk capital to advance the project was its
own inadequacy. The Minister was under no obligation to take into account its aspiration

that KPLC would enable it to overcome that deficiency.

The Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s case that the Minister failed to take into account a

relevant consideration.

(11) Reliance On Own Wrong

This is an unusual administrative law basis for challenging a Ministerial decision. It
appears to involve the proposition that WalAm’s failure to perform was caused by Kenya.
The cases relied on for the proposition are civil cases, not public law cases. The principle
is stated, for example, in the terms that a contracting party cannot take advantage of its own

breach. This line of authority has no relevance to this case, which turns on public law.

Insofar as such a consideration is relevant, it turns on the assertion that there was
inexcusable delay on the part of Kenya with respect to the finalisation of a PPA and, as

originally pleaded, a lack of good faith in negotiations for a PPA.

182

500.

We have referred above to the evidence of the witnesses from KPLC. We accept their
evidence that WalAm approached the negotiations without any understanding of the key
elements of the tariff structure. Specifically, they never put forward the detail of the costs
of the project which were essential for computing the capacity charge in the tariff formula.
As we have found in Section IV, WalAm did not have the funds that it believed were

required—US$3 million, to finalise a PPA.

Although the Claimant had originally asserted a claim that Kenya did not negotiate in good
faith, it failed to include any such relief in its final request for relief, which was introduced
on the final day of the hearing, after discussions during the Claimant’s closing
submissions.*!! After further discussion during the Respondent’s closing submissions
about whether the good faith case had been abandoned, counsel for the Claimant informed
the Tribunal: “[y]ou do not have to decide whether the KPLC negotiated in good faith or
not.”*? Any negotiations for a PPA, on the part of Kenya, had to be conducted with KPLC.
Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the allegation of failure to negotiate in good faith had
been abandoned. In any event, the Tribunal has heard the KPLC witnesses and reviewed
their communications with WalAm. We find that their dealings with WalAm was entirely

appropriate and there was no “wrong” on which Kenya now relies.

(12) — Procedural Fairness

The requirements of procedural fairness are not a fixed body of rules. What is required in
relation to the object of administrative action will depend upon the statutory context in each
case and the nature of the action. We do not find it necessary to set out the authorities to
which we were referred. The basic principles are well established and well known. The
statutory context of the authorities varies widely and the focus must be on the particular

statutory framework under consideration.

The Claimant placed great reliance on cases which emphasised the need for notice, in the

sense of giving the person an opportunity to remedy the defect. The Tribunal accepts this

“1! Counsel for the Claimant said: “[w]e are not alleging--and our case doesn’t turn on having to show bad faith
negotiations”. Transcript D6:P1729:L7-9 (Benson).

principle. The assessment of procedural fairness requires attention to the course of
interaction between the Ministry and KPLC with WalAm. We have set out the facts above.
The Tribunal determines that, over the period of more than five years between grant of the
Licence and Forfeiture, the Claimant had sufficient notice of the MOE requirement that it
had to conduct work on the ground and sufficient opportunity to remedy its failure. At first
the required work was drilling exploration wells. Later, the work required was
commencement of preparatory infrastructure in the form of roads and a water pipeline.
Furthermore, WalAm knew over 18 months before forfeiture, that its Licence was at risk

if it did not deliver.
The events of particular relevance for this finding are:

a. The Authority to Explore of 3 September 2007 stated: “[t]he company will carry
out a two phased exploration program”. The second phase was the drilling of two

exploration wells.

db. On 29 September 2009 Mr Nyoike wrote expressly stating that it would not be
possible to conclude a PPA unless three wells had been drilled. He also stated that
the Licence had been granted on the understanding that WalAm had the financial

capacity to carry out the project.

c. On 30 August 2010 Mr Walji wrote to the Minister acknowledging: “[i]t may seem
that WalAm has not been doing much work in Kenya”. After referring to the
consultant reports he concluded: “which will now lead to Walam being ready to

drill as per schedule”.

d. In February/March 2011 discussions occurred between WalAm and the MOE over
its new Work Program. The MOE asked for the first version to be rewritten to
include timetables and budget allocations for each activity in the Program,

including the drilling of three exploration wells.

e. On 8 March 2011 Mr Walji wrote to the Minister saying that at a meeting on
21 February Mr Nyoike had said: “Walam has not done enough ‘work on the
ground’.” Mr Walji accepted that this referred to physical work such as a road a
pipeline or drilling.

184

502.

503.

504.

f. In the subsequent conversation between Mr Nyoike and Mr Mugambi Gituru on
what the former had meant by “work on the ground”, he referred to roads and water,
but not to drilling. The need for physical work at the site was clearly emphasised.

The concern about the lack of such activity was clear.

g. Approval of the Work Program was given by letter from Mr Nyoike of 23 March
2011. The express basis of that approval was that the Program would be “strictly
adhered to”. This included provision for both road and water pipeline development

as well as drilling of one exploratory well before the end of the year.

h. During these discussions in early 2011, as Mr Laing testified, Mr Nyoike threatened
to withdraw WalAm’s Licence on the basis that it had not yet drilled a well. This
is over a year before the Show Cause letter and over 18 months before forfeiture.
WalAm was on notice of this risk from this time, as reinforced by the “strictly

adhered to” condition.

Before the Show Cause letter WalAm understood the grounds on which the ultimate
forfeiture would be made. It had received clear notice of that risk. There was no denial of

procedural fairness.

(13) Consent and Estoppel

The Claimant contends that Kenya consented to WalAm not performing work in or under
the land until it had a PPA. Section 11(1)(a) excludes conduct for which there was written

consent.

The Claimant first relies in this regard on Mr Nyoike’s letter to Mr Walji of 23 March
20114" whereby approval of the work plan set out was granted “with the understanding
that the schedule will be strictly adhered to” and on the fact that Kenya “continued to accept
reports of WalAm’s work including by [that letter]”.*'* The letter went on to advise WalAm

to seek direct audience with the Managing Director of KPLC to negotiate a PPA.

The Claimant seeks to argue that this letter evidences either the consent of the Ministry to
no work being done in or under the land until a PPA was obtained or while negotiations for
a PPA were proceeding (as directed by Mr Nyoike in the last paragraph) alternatively that
based on Mr Nyoike’s comments to that effect Kenya should be estopped from relying on

the failure to perform work in or under the land.
The Tribunal cannot accept that argument for the reasons below.

That letter is more fully set out and discussed at paragraphs 256 to 261 above. The meaning
and suggested legal effect of this letter must be considered in the context of WalAm’s
proposals for a Work Program of which it sought approval starting with Mr Walji’s letter
of 9 December 2010 discussed in paragraph 248 and following.

First it should be noted that there is nothing express in the letter which can be regarded as

a statement of consent to WalAm not performing work in or under the land.

Second there is nothing by way of express representation that could found an estoppel to

that effect.

Third the context in which the Work Program was proposed and to which Mr Nyoike
responded was that WalAm had been made aware of the Minister’s dissatisfaction with the
lack of progress and specifically lack of work on the ground and that the licence was under

threat of forfeiture (see paragraphs 252-253 above). That is significant because:

a. From WalAm’s side the Work Program proposed must have been directed at
allaying the Minister’s concerns, reassuring that work on the ground would be done;

and

db. From Kenya’s side there was no prospect (or expectation) of Mr Nyoike now telling
WalAm that it did not need to do work on the ground and that the Licence was at

no risk.

As first submitted, the Work Program did not contain timelines for when work would be
carried out. Nor did it provide cost estimates. The MOE required those to be supplied.*'®

It is for that reason that the Work Program set out timelines which included dates for work

513.

on the ground running effectively immediately. Thus the workplan proposed by WalAm
and approved by Mr Nyoike’s letter provided for “Jnfrastructure Development” including
roads and water pipelines in the period February to December 2011 and the drilling
programme to commence in the period April-December 2011 with a view to first well spud

in December 2011.

Item 9 on the Work Program proposed stated:

I 1 1 j
9. Work with MOE and KPLC to conclude the “TERM SHEET for Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). | March 7 to March $65,000.00 Ongoing
Project development of net 75 Mwe. Power rate (Tariff) to be discussed and finalized and based on 31,2011
Capital costs borne by WalAm,
Finalize PPA

 

 

WalAm places reliance on this aspect of the proposal as indicative of the importance to it
of obtaining a PPA, which it did. But it does not assist its consent and estoppel argument

for three reasons.

a. First the reference to concluding a Term Sheet was a recognition that WalAm was
nowhere near being in a position to negotiate let alone conclude a PPA within any
short period of time. It did not have the information ready, the professional support
or the financial resources to be able to do so by the end of March (the Work Program

having been proposed in February), see paragraph 253 above.

db. Second WalAm proposed a timeline for the Term Sheet (7 March to 31 March
2011) in parallel with the other timeliness in the Work Program. Infrastructure work
was proposed to commence in February 2011. There was no suggestion that other
line items in the work program were conditional or to be delayed or deferred

dependent on the conclusion of a Term Sheet , let alone a PPA.

c. Third and most importantly Mr Nyoike’s response to the proposal was clear in
approving the Work Plan “with the understanding that the schedule will be strictly
adhered to”. That was a reference to those matters in the table set out in the letter
(see paragraph 256 above) so there is no doubt about which of the timelines was
being referred to including the February to December 2011 Infrastructural
Development work which was work on the ground. Mr Nyoike had carefully
considered each element of the Work Plan proposed because he made two

significant changes to what had been proposed when setting out what was required

187

514.

S15.

516.

S17.

in the table in his letter. He reduced expenditure on drilling from US$21 million to
US$6.5 million with only one well, which would be drilled in 2011, not five, and
the others in 2012. He specifically approved the separate line item for constructing
access roads, to cost US$2.7 million, and a water pipeline, to cost US$4.96 million.

Both were to be completed before the first well was spudded.*!°

But significantly Mr Nyoike did not include in his table the line item 9 from the Work
Program proposed, the Term Sheet. He responded to that by his last paragraph of his letter
“you are advised to seek direct audience with the Managing Director, [KPLC] for

negotiations on a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) as per the regulations.”

Importantly therefore no conditionality was sought and none approved in response and it
is clear, in view of the disquiet that had been made known to WalAm about lack of progress,
that the Ministry would not have consented to any such deferral of work on the ground,
even if it had been asked for. Bearing in mind the nature of the discussions and concerns
rg

in February, Mr Nyoike’s “strictly adhered to” language carried, as we have said above in

paragraph 483 a tone of “/ast chance” for WalAm to get on and show progress on the land.

Mr Nyoike’s 23 March 2011 letter cannot therefore support either an argument that it
expressly or impliedly consented to WalAm doing no work on the ground or that it
otherwise expressly or impliedly represented that WalAm need not do so until a PPA was

concluded or otherwise.

The Claimant relies also on WalAm’s repeated emphasis on its need for a PPA and
statements that a PPA would have to be in place before they would do the high capital
intensive drilling work.*'’ The fact of that emphasis by WalAm and its significance has
already been discussed. Far from giving rise to agreement or consent from the Ministry, it
simply confirmed the difference of view between WalAm and the Ministry. In response to
a letter from WalAm asserting the need to have a PPA before raising capital, Mr Nyoike

replied on 29 September 20 in firm language that there could not be meaningful

519.

negotiations on a PPA until project costs had been determined after exploration wells had

been drilled.“!* The MOE never resiled from that position.

Mr Nyoike accepted in cross-examination that WalAm had, each time it submitted a
document, said that they needed a PPA but he had never accepted that anything was
conditional on that, and he denied that Mr Walji had said at the 11 March meeting
presenting the Work Plan that WalAm needed to have a PPA in place before they were
going to spend US$30 million on drilling.“'° He said that WalAm had told him that work
and the obtaining of the PPA “was running concurrently”.”° He expected the PPA

negotiations to take two or three months.*”!

The Claimant relied as a further example of Mr Walji’s statements on his letter to
Mr Nyoike of 12 April 2011” referring to Mr Nyoike’s letter of 23 March 2011 and saying
“w]e would like to advice you and re-affirm that, as stated in our 2011 Work Program, all
of the proposed tasks timelines are contingent on WalAm concluding an acceptable PPA
prior to the end of May 2011”.* But in view of the exchanges that had already taken place,
and the absence of any accepting response from Mr Nyoike, that assertion cannot be taken
as evidencing consent or agreement from the Ministry. On the contrary, the absence of any
reference by Mr Walji to having obtained any agreement or acceptance of that contingency
from Mr Nyoike rather suggests that he well understood that he had not obtained it.
Mr Nyoike did not respond, and in view of the fact that he had made his position clear, did
not need to — Mr Walji could not unilaterally change the terms of the approval given by

Mr Nyoike.

523.

The Claimant made a similar argument by reference to Mr Walji’s letter of 7 November
2011 telling Mr Nyoike that WalAm was still awaiting a draft PPA from KPLC and that
upon conclusion of a PPA the drilling programme would proceed, to which letter
Mr Nyoike did not respond. But again the absence of reference to any agreement to that

effect in the letter cuts against the Claimant’s argument that consent had been given.

The Claimant cannot establish consent on the basis of WalAm’s assertions nor can it
contend that there is any procedural unfairness in circumstances where Mr Nyoike’s letters
made sufficiently clear that the Ministry expected the Work Plan (which included physical
activity on the land) to be adhered to. Indeed the frequency of the repetition of the point
by Mr Walji and the absence of any acceptance of it, let alone agreement not to forfeit,
might be said to count against WalAm — Mr Walji clearly felt it necessary to restate it

precisely because he did not have agreement or even a basis of mutual understanding.*”*

The Claimant alternatively contends that even if there was no agreement or consent on the
part of the Ministry that WalAm did not need to do work in or under the land prior to
concluding a PPA, nevertheless the right to forfeit for failure to do such work was waived
or Kenya is estopped from relying on it by reason of Mr Nyoike’s conduct. The Claimant
relies on the same evidence in this regard and the waiver and estoppel arguments must fail
for the same reasons. The Claimant is unable to show any clear representation by or on
behalf of the Minister that the Claimant need not do work in or under the land until it had

a concluded PPA.

It is apparent that there was no acceptance on these occasions of WalAm’s wish to have
some form of general agreement about the terms of a PPA before incurring capital
expenditure on infrastructure. This is reinforced by the evidence from KPLC which we

discuss at paragraphs 321-327 of Section IV.

Mr Walji’s evidence on this point was somewhat inconsistent but he accepted that he did not obtain any

understanding that the Work Programme was contingent on a PPA from Mr Nyoike’s letter of 23 March 2011
(Transcript D2:P436:L11-13 (Walji_ cross-examination) and Transcript D2:P437:L20-22 (Walji_ cross-
examination)). In any event consent would have to be established by objective assessment of something said or
done by or on behalf of the Minister.

190

524.

525.

526.

527.

There was a great deal of evidence in this case on whether WalAm should, or could, have
drilled exploratory wells. It is not necessary to conclusively determine that issue. There
were other, less expensive matters that it could have performed at the site, specifically, the

road and water infrastructure required for the first well.

There was no consent by Kenya to the cessation of physical activities. There was no

conduct by Kenya that could form the basis of an estoppel or waiver as alleged.

(14) Legitimate Expectations

The Claimant also argues that it had a legitimate expectation that it would not be required
to begin drilling before a PPA was in place and that the failure to take that legitimate
expectation into account infects the Minister’s exercise of discretion. That contention
raises two questions. First did the Claimant have a legitimate expectation to that effect,

and second, if so, is the Minister’s decision to be set aside for failing to take it into account.

The Claimant’s argument fails on the first question. For the Claimant to have a legitimate
expectation in the public law sense requires it to be shown that statements were made by
or on behalf of the Minister inducing a reasonable expectation. As the authority relied on
by the Claimant states “[a] legitimate expectation arises where a person responsible for
taking a decision has induced in someone a reasonable expectation that he will receive or
retain a benefit or advantage.” But as shown by a review of the same evidence as is
relied on by the Claimant to support its consent argument (see Section VIII.B(13) above),
there was never any representation from Mr Nyoike that could be said to have induced such
an expectation. Certainly Mr Walji wanted to elicit such a representation, but he signally
failed to obtain it, and he was conscious that he had not done so (as evidenced by his
repetition of WalAm’s position). There was nothing in Kenya’s conduct which could be
said to create an unfairness in relying on the absence of work in and under the land as a

basis for forfeiture.

528.

In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal does not place reliance on the Ministry’s letter to
Mr Walji of 29 September 2009*”’ which stated in terms in section 6.0 that “WalAm will
need to drill at least three (3) geothermal wells which will provide the required information
on the capacity of power to be generated and therefore making it possibly to fruitfully
negotiate for PPA with [KPLC]’. That letter is not insignificant in showing that WalAm
did not have, at the outset, any understanding that Kenya would not require some
exploratory drilling at an early stage — after all that letter was in specific response to
questions and queries raised by WalAm for the Chief Geologist on 27 March 2009. WalAm
had informed him that “WalAm expects to award the drilling contract prior to December
31,2009 and to commence drilling at Suswa before the end of the I Qtr 2010.”*°* But the
Tribunal accepts that the position taken by Mr Nyoike in 2009 was not a position expressly
taken by Mr Nyoike in 2011 or 2012 and the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s submission
that this letter answers the Claimant’s legitimate expectation case. But even focusing on
the 2011 and 2012 period the Claimant fails to establish the necessary evidential basis and

support for its legitimate expectation argument.

INTERNATIONAL LAW ISSUES

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES
(dd) Claimant’s Position
(a) Expropriation
The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s declaration of forfeiture constitutes an

unlawful expropriation under both international law and Kenyan law, which incorporates

the general rules of international law.*””

The Claimant’s primary submission is that the principles of customary international law
are “memorialize[d]” in Article 40(3) of the Kenyan Constitution.“ Alternatively, it
submits if there is any divergence, then the application of Article 2(5) of the Kenyan
Constitution, which incorporates the “general rules of international law” into Kenyan law,
operates to fill any “gap or inconsistency” between the two.**!

The Claimant notes that the Parties do not disagree on the articulation of the legal standard

for unlawful expropriation under customary international law.”

According to the Claimant, the Respondent expropriated its investment in Kenya because
any one of the following factors was present:
(i) Respondent failed to provide fair and effective compensation for
the expropriation of the License; (ii) the License was not taken for
a public purpose; (iti) Respondent failed to accord WalAm basic
principles of due process; or (iv) Respondent’s expropriation was
discriminatory.
The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s defense that the taking of the Licence cannot

constitute an unlawful expropriation because it was done in accordance with the terms of

the Licence, the GRA and the GRR. According to the Claimant, and as explained above,
the forfeiture of the Licence “had no basis in the terms of the License and the statutory
framework? .“*

534. The Claimant also adds that GDC, the entity to which it alleges WalAm had been asked by
the Minister to hand over its Licence, three years before, sought to exercise the right to
develop Suswa. GDC advertised its decision to develop the Suswa project in partnership
with a private company and proposed to deliver Suswa’s steam to an international partner,
who would be responsible for building and operating the power plant. GDC sold this

proposed partnership to international investors as “low-hanging fruit ready for takeoff’.

(b) Minimum Standard of Treatment

535. The Claimant argues that the Respondent violated its duty to accord the Claimant the
minimum standard of treatment under customary international law and under Article 47 of
the Kenyan Constitution as a result of the Respondent’s “wrongful and obstructive conduct
during WalAm’s performance of the License, in particular its refusal to negotiate the PPA
and its wrongful declaration of forfeiture of the License.”*° The Claimant articulates the

legal standard as follows:

[I]n considering whether the minimum standard of treatment has
been breached, a tribunal must be guided by the overarching
principle that foreign investments should be protected from ‘all such
acts or behavior that might infringe a sense of fairness, equity and
reasonableness.’ The minimum standard of treatment can be
distilled into several basic elements, any one or combination of
which is sufficient to demonstrate a_ breach, including
unreasonableness, arbitrariness, failure to act in good faith, lack of
transparency and candor in an administrative process, disregard of
due process of law, discrimination, and the frustration of legitimate

expectations of the investor based on representations made at the

time of investment.”
At the Hearing, the Claimant explained that the “Respondent undermined the very
reasonably held and legitimate expectations of the Claimant [that] there would be a
mutually agreeable Memorandum of Understanding for Power Purchase Agreement before
exploration drilling commences, and that the tariff rate would be based on an after-tax IRR

of 18.5 percent. That was established right at the outset.”***

The Claimant argues that there is no requirement under customary international law to
show that the Respondent’s conduct was egregious or in bad faith to establish a breach of
minimum standard of treatment however given the circumstances, the “Respondent’s acts

meet this higher threshold.”*”

According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s actions for the duration of the Licence were
“unfair, arbitrary, discriminatory, incomplete disregard of due process, and undermined
WalAm’s legitimate expectations.” In particular, the Claimant highlights, inter alia, the

following:

a. The Respondent’s obstructive conduct preventing WalAm from enjoying its

investment and realising the goal of bringing Suswa into production;

db. The Respondent’s delays and refusal to act in good faith to negotiate a PPA with
the Claimant despite knowing that without a PPA no investor could finance the

substantial capital expenses required to move forward with the project;

c. The Respondent delaying PPA discussions with WalAm only to wrongfully declare
the Licence forfeited for WalAm’s alleged failure to build a power plant within five

years of geothermal resource exploration;“!

d. The Respondent’s wrongful declaration of forfeiture;“”
e. The Respondent’s failure to reinstate or reissue the Licence; and
f. The Respondent’s and GDC’s reliance on the work of WalAm to market Suswa.““*

(2) Respondent’s Position

As a preliminary point, the Respondent argues that the merits of the Claimant’s unlawful
expropriation and unfair treatment claims should be determined under Kenyan law for the
reasons set out above.’ However, if the Tribunal were to determine that customary
international law was applicable, as the Claimant contends, the Respondent’s position is

that these claims would also fail.“

(a) Expropriation

The Respondent argues that the forfeiture of the Licence is not an unlawful expropriation.
The Respondent submits that the rights under the Licence were contractual in nature, as the
Claimant itself suggested. It was, therefore, subject to the terms of the instrument by which

the contract was created.” It argues that:

The present dispute relating to the forfeiture of the Licence likewise
does not engage any constitutional protection against
expropriation; it is a dispute that must be determined in accordance
with the terms of the Licence and the statutory framework under
which it was issued. As explained in the preceding sections, the
declaration of forfeiture was made in accordance with those terms
and was thus lawful.“*

The Respondent concludes that if the forfeiture was lawful under the terms of the Licence
and its legal framework, as they argue it was, such forfeiture cannot engage constitutional

protection and there can be no unlawful expropriation.”

For the same reasons, the Respondent submits, it would fail under international law.” The

forfeiture did not constitute an expropriation at all.

(b) Minimum Standard of Treatment

The Respondent contends that the Claimant has incorrectly stated the content of the
minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. It contends that the
Claimant has wrongly equated that standard with the fair and equitable standard in

investment treaties. The latter is “a more generous standard”.*!

The Respondent submits that its conduct did not violate any protection against unfair
treatment. It argues that the Claimant has not established any breach of the minimum
standard of treatment under customary international law, however interpreted, for the same
reasons that there has been no breach of the principle of fair administration and natural

justice under Kenyan law.*?

At the Hearing the Respondent submitted that “[t]he Claimant has fallen a very long way
short of establishing the proposition that legitimate expectations form part of the customary

international law minimum standard as established by State practice and opinio juris.”**

The Respondent claims that to the extent that the Claimant’s allegations of unfair treatment
rely on acts and/or omissions of KPLC and GDC, the Claimant must establish that those

acts are attributable to the Respondent which it fails to do.

The Respondent also rejects the Claimant’s claims that the Respondent violated the
minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, as well as its duty to
act fairly under Article 47 of the Kenyan Constitution. As pointed out by the Respondent,
the Claimant’s claims under Kenyan law and customary international law turn largely on
the question of whether the Licence was forfeited in accordance with its terms and the
statutory framework (GRR and GRA).**> The Respondent submits that it was and hence,

that the Claimant’s claims are without factual or legal basis.**°

TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS
(dd) Expropriation
As mentioned above, Article 40(3) of the Kenyan Constitution makes express provision
prohibiting expropriation of interests in property. The Tribunal is not satisfied that there is
any scope for the operation of international law in this respect. The Claimant reserved its

position in this regard if there was a “gap or inconsistency”. Even accepting that that was

the relevant test, no such factor has been identified.

In any event, the reasons for which the Tribunal dismissed the Claimant’s reliance on
Article 40(3) apply to the claim based on customary international law. The Tribunal
accepts the Respondent’s submission that there was no expropriation at all. For the reasons
set out above in the Section on The Validity of the Forfeiture, the
Licence was forfeited in accordance with its terms and the statutory framework under
which it was issued. Most relevantly, the Tribunal has rejected the Claimant’s case that
there was no factual basis for the forfeiture; that it constituted unjust enrichment; that it
was unreasonable or disproportionate; or that the discretion miscarried in a number of
respects.

Once forfeiture occurred, the State was entitled to re-issue the licence. The fact that it was
re-issued to a government agency which proposed to have ultimate development

undertaken by private investors does not constitute expropriation. The Claimant’s

suggestion that there was some kind of underlying plan to cause this to happen was not
established on the evidence. As we have noted in Section IV, and in particular paragraph
330 above, Mr Nyoike denied it and Mr Bloomquist expressly abandoned any suggestion
that the conversation with the CEO of GDC, that it would like to develop Suswa,

represented a policy position. It was just a personal view.

(2) Minimum Standard of Treatment

Each of the elements said by the Claimant to be capable of constituting unfair treatment in
breach of the international law standard have been considered above in the discussion of
Kenyan administrative law principles. The Tribunal has rejected the Claimant’s case on
ultra vires; unjust enrichment; good faith; unreasonableness; proportionality; improper
purpose; duty to act fairly; relevant and irrelevant considerations; procedural fairness;
consent; estoppel and reliance on own wrong. We reject the Claimant’s reliance on many

of these elements in its case on minimum standard of treatment, for the same reasons.

With respect to the legitimate expectations element, the Claimant relies on the same
evidence considered above in Section IX.A(1)(b) for its submission that there has been a
breach of the minimum standard of treatment under international law. It accepts that this
contention is based on the same legitimate expectations arguments and there is, in this
regard, no difference with Kenyan law.*” It must also fail for the same reasons as we

rejected the legitimate expectations submissions under Kenyan law.

In closing submissions, the Claimant noted that there may not be the same overlap with
regard to other elements and referred to the pleadings, mentioning the example of arbitrary
conduct.*** Legitimate expectations had been emphasised in the oral opening submissions,
but with added reference to lack of transparency, arbitrariness of the forfeiture and the

acquisition of an interest by GDC.“

For the reasons set out in the Validity of Forfeiture Section, as briefly summarised in the

third last paragraph, there was nothing arbitrary about Kenya’s conduct. Nor was it

“unfair”, or “discriminatory” or made “in disregard of due process”, as also alleged in the
Claimant’s Memorial. As noted above, the rejection of the Claimant’s cognate submissions
on Kenyan administrative law principles, leads to the rejection of its case on minimum

standard of treatment.

555. GDC was asked by the Minister, on 1 November 2012, the day after the Forfeiture,
expressly in the context of WalAm’s non-performance, to undertake a resource assessment
of Suswa.* At that time the Government of Kenya had developed a policy for GDC to
undertake the high risk investment of establishing the resource, including exploratory
drilling, before involving private investors in further development.**! GDC proceeded to

seek funding to explore the resource.

556. The Respondent denied the Claimant’s contention that GDC made use of expert reports
commissioned by WalAm after it acquired an interest in Suswa. It adduced evidence that
GDC commissioned and paid for its own ESIA study from Redplan and did not use any
WalAm reports. Mr Ngugi repeated his evidence in the course of cross-examination and

was not challenged.‘

557. The Claimant placed particular emphasis on its failure to obtain a PPA. As set out in the
Facts and applied above in the analysis of legitimate expectations in Kenyan law, WalAm
never had an expectation, let alone a legitimate expectation, that a PPA would be negotiated
before money could be raised and any substantial work done. Even if there was any
relevant expectation, the Claimant failed to undertake the preparatory work needed to place
acoherent proposal before KPLC for consideration of the key commercial terms of a PPA.

Indeed, it never had the financial capability to do so. KPLC did not cause the delay. It was

never provided with information, that could only be known to WalAm, to proceed with any

meaningful negotiation.

The Claimant relied on cases in which international arbitral tribunals have held that absence
of objections or silence may give rise to an expectation on the part of a claimant.‘
However, those cases cannot be stretched to support a suggestion that mere silence on the
part of the State can give rise to a preclusion from relying on the statutory framework under

which an investor acquired an interest.

In any event, as discussed in Section IV, there was not silence on the part of Kenya. For
example, as has been discussed, by his letter of 29 September 2009, Mr Nyoike expressly
rejected WalAm’s suggestion that a PPA should precede WalAm obtaining funding. That
position never changed, perhaps most clearly stated in the 23 March 2011, approval of the
Work Plan which, in the form set out in that letter, had to be “strictly adhered to”, without
any linkage to the timetable for a PPA as originally proposed (see further the discussion in

relation to Consent and Estoppel in Section VIII.B(13) above).

As the Claimant cannot succeed on the facts, it is unnecessary to determine whether the
development of legitimate expectations principles in the investment treaty context has

become part of customary international law.

The Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s case based on the minimum standard of treatment.

REMEDIES

In view of the Tribunal’s decisions on the claims above, the question of remedies does not
arise and it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider what remedies would have been
appropriate had the Claimant established either the invalidity of the forfeiture or any of its

other claims.

RESPONDENT’S COST SUBMISSIONS

The Respondent argues that the Claimant should bear all the costs and expenses of these
proceedings, including the Respondent’s legal fees and expenses which it presents as

follows:

a. Legal fees and expenses (including VAT where applicable) in the amount of:
i. €3,411,875.24 for Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP; and
ii, €886,249.16 for Coulson Harney LLP
db. Experts’ fees and expenses in the amount of:
i. €435,611.26 for Charles River Associates;
ii. US$40,112.00 for ISOR;
iii. €47,650.05 for Verkis; and
c. Party expenses incurred by the Republic of Kenya in the amount of:
US$296,238.43.4%

The Respondent has also submitted a claim for advances on costs paid to ICSID in the
amount of US$500,000. In total, the Respondent requests an order of costs from the

Tribunal for €4,761,385.71 and US$40,112.00.4°7

The Respondent argues that if the Tribunal finds in favour of the Respondent on liability,
the Respondent should be awarded all of its costs incurred in defending itself in this
arbitration. It argues that such costs should include the Respondent’s costs for the

jurisdictional phase as well as the merits phase of this arbitration.“

The Respondent adds that if the Claimant succeeds on liability, however, the Claimant
should not be awarded all of its costs because (i) the Claimant should not be awarded costs
that exceed the Respondent’s own costs (ii) the costs of the jurisdictional phase should be
borne by the party that incurred them because “the objections made were serious objections
that needed to be determined by the Tribunal for these claims to proceed”*® (iii) the
Respondent should not bear the costs related to remedies sought by the Claimant that are

not ultimately awarded.*”

Finally, the Respondent argues that even if the Claimant does prevail on liability, “there
should additionally be some apportionment of costs to the Respondent to reflect the

unnecessary costs of the proceedings caused by the Claimant’s conduct of the case.”*"

TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON COSTS
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as

the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the

parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how

and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members

of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the

Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.
This provision together with ICSID Arbitration Rule 28 gives the Tribunal the widest
discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney’s fees and other costs,

between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

The Tribunal is of the view that in principle the Claimant should bear the costs of the
arbitration having brought claims which have failed on the merits. In this case there is no
reason to depart from a general approach that the unsuccessful party should pay the

successful party its costs and bear the arbitration costs.

However the Respondent raised Preliminary Objections which, as a result of the bifurcation
of the proceedings to enable those objections to be heard and determined, have the costs of
a distinct phase of the proceedings associated with them. The Respondent’s objections
were dismissed. While the Tribunal accepts that those objections were, as the Respondent
contends, “serious objections that needed to be determined by the Tribunal”, they only
required determination because they were raised by the Respondent. The Tribunal
considers it appropriate therefore to make an adjustment to the general approach to make
allowance for the Claimant’s success and the Respondent’s failure in the Preliminary
Objections phase. Taking a necessarily broad brush approach, the Tribunal determines that
the Claimant should pay 75% of the Respondent’s legal costs and of the costs of the
arbitration including the fees and expenses of the tribunal and ICSID’s administrative fees

and direct expenses.

The Tribunal notes that the Respondent’s legal costs are very substantially lower than the
Claimant’s legal costs and, while that fact is not determinative of reasonableness, the
Tribunal considers that the Respondent’s legal costs are reasonable in amount, taking into

account the size and significance of the case.

The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses
Mr Joe Smouha QC US$418,572.72
Mr Swithin J. Munyantwali US$281,834.61

The Honourable James

Spigelman AC QC US$256,865.25

ICSID’s administrative fees US$190,000
Direct expenses US$150,442.92
Total US$1,297.715.50

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.*””

each party pro rata to the amounts paid. The Tribunal would have preferred to be able to
take into account by way of adjustment to the amount of costs awarded any residual balance
held at ICSID but understands that it is not empowered to do so because of the terms on

which such sums are held.

Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay the Respondent US$648,857.75 for
the Respondent’s portion of the arbitration costs and the sums of €3,586,039.28 and
US$252,262.82 to cover 75% of the Respondent’s legal fees and expenses.

The Tribunal incorporates by reference into this Award, the Decision on Jurisdiction dated

27 March 2017 which dismissed the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction.

DISPOSITIVE

For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

(1) All of the Claimant’s claims are dismissed; and

(2) The Claimant shall bear its own legal fees and expenses and the entirety of the costs
of the arbitration. The Claimant shall pay the Respondent US$648,857.75
corresponding to its share of the costs of the arbitration. The Claimant shall also

reimburse 75% of the Respondent’s legal fees and expenses in the amount of

€3,586,039.28 and US$252,262.82.
