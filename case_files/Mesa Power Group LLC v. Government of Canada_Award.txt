MAIN FACTS

The following summary is meant to give a general overview of the present dispute. It
does not include all facts which may be of relevance, particularly as they emerged from
the extensive evidence gathered at the hearing. To the extent relevant and useful,
additional facts will be discussed in the Tribunal’s analysis of the disputed issues.

A. BACKGROUND OF ONTARIO’S ELECTRICITY SECTOR

The origins of Ontario's electricity system can be traced back to 1906, when the
Government of Ontario (the “Government”) established the Hydro-Electric Power
Commission of Ontario, which was later renamed Ontario Hydro. As a vertically
integrated monopoly, Ontario Hydro coordinated generation and transmission together.

In 1998, following the general trend to introduce competition into regulated monopoly
sectors, the Government sought to modify the regulation and management of the
electricity system in the province through the Energy Competition Act, the Electricity Act
and the Ontario Energy Board Act. Ontario Hydro was restructured and its assets were
distributed among separate corporate entities. These successor entities included (i) the
Independent Market Operator, later renamed Independent Electricity System Operator,
(“IESO”), which was charged with administering the electricity market as well as directing
the flow of electricity from generators to consumers through the transmission system;
and (ii) Hydro One, Inc. (“Hydro One”), which assumed the transmission and rural

distribution business of Ontario Hydro.

The Government again restructured the electricity system in 2002 and in 2004. In 2004,
through the Electricity Restructuring Act, the Government created the Ontario Power
Authority (“OPA”), which was to be responsible for long-term system planning,
procurement of new generation through long term power purchase agreements, and the
promotion of the diversification of Ontario's electricity supply with a particular emphasis
on renewable energy.

In keeping with its intention to eliminate Ontario’s reliance on coal-fired generation
facilities, the Government launched several initiatives for the promotion of renewable
sources of energy. Among these was the 2006 Renewable Energy Standard Offer
Program (“RESOP”), which by 2008 had resulted in 3145 20-year fixed-price contracts
for the procurement of approximately 1,300 MW of renewably generated electricity.

In 2009, in the wake of the global financial crisis, the Government enacted the Green
Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009 (the “GEGEA’) to “build a green economy.” The
GEGEA amended 15 existing statutes and constituted a new standalone legislation
known as the Green Energy Act, 2009 (the “GEA”). Notably, the GEGEA added section
25.35 to the Electricity Act authorizing the Minister of Energy of the Government (the
“Minister of Energy’) to direct the OPA to develop a feed-in tariff program (the “FIT
Program”) to promote the generation and consumption of renewable energy in the
province. The OPA was to be responsible for implementing the FIT Program, including
setting prices and administering contracts entered into under that program.

B. THE FIT PROGRAM

Work on designing the FIT Program began in early 2009. On 24 September 2009, after
several stakeholder consultations, the Minister of Energy formally directed the OPA to
create the FIT Program.’ The FIT Program was to achieve specified goals. One of these
goals was that participants in the program satisfy prescribed domestic content
requirements: developers who had a milestone date for commercial operation on or
before 31 December 2011 would have to meet a domestic content requirement of 25%,
and those with a later milestone date would have to meet a domestic content
requirement of 50%. As will be seen below, the latter requirement applied to the

Claimant's projects.

The FIT Program was formally launched by the OPA on 1 October 2009. It was
accompanied by the FIT Rules, which set the eligibility criteria for the program as well
as the criteria for evaluating applications to the FIT Program. These Rules were
amended on several occasions.

Exh. R-057.
Exh. R-001.

Under the FIT Program, interested parties were to apply for a 20 or 40-year power
purchase agreement (a “FIT Contract”) with the OPA. Under a FIT Contract, generators
would be paid a guaranteed price per kWh for electricity delivered into the Ontario
electricity system. Participation in the FIT Program was open to projects located in
Ontario that generated electricity exclusively from one or more sources of renewable
energy. Applicants had to be connected to the electricity grid (either to a distribution
system, a transmission system or through a customer).

The FIT Program itself was divided into two streams: the FIT stream for projects with a
production capacity exceeding 10 kW and the microFIT stream for projects with a lower
capacity. All of the Claimant's projects fell within the FIT stream.

When launching the FIT Program, the Government was concerned that the number of
applications would not be sufficient to meet Ontario’s energy needs. In reality, a high
number of applications were filed and the Government employed an “independent
fairness monitor’, London Economics International, LLC (“LEI”), inter alia to design a

system to process the large number of applications.

C. APPLICATIONS TO THE FIT PROGRAM

The FIT Rules set out a process for scoring and ranking applications to determine which
projects would receive FIT Contracts. Projects with the highest rankings would be

awarded contracts based on available transmission capacity.

The process involved two phases: a special process for ranking applications received
during the first 60 days of the program (“the Launch Period”) and a standard process
for ranking applications received later. Applications received during the Launch Period
would be ranked based on criteria identifying the most development-ready (or “shovel-
ready”) projects, whereas all other applications would be ranked based on the time when
they were received by the OPA.

1. Launch Period Applications

Applications received between 1 October and 30 November 2009 (“Launch Period
Applications”) were deemed to have been received at the same time. Applicants during
this period could advance their ranking by demonstrating that their projects were “shovel-
ready.” In order to assess shovel-readiness, the OPA looked at four criteria: (i) whether

20.

21.

22.

23.

24.

the project was exempt from the Renewable Energy Approval (“REA”) Process (“REA
Exemption Point”); (ii) whether the applicant owned or had a firm order for a major
component (“Major Equipment Control Point”); (iii) whether the applicant had
successfully developed a similar facility (“Prior Experience Point”); and (iv) whether the
applicant had financial backing (“Financial Capacity Point’).

If an applicant satisfied all of these criteria, it would be awarded four points. For each
point awarded, the applicant committed to operate its project 90 days earlier than
otherwise required under the standard FIT Contract (“COD Acceleration Days’).
Accordingly, if an applicant bid for all four criteria points, it committed to bring its project
into commercial operation 360 days earlier than otherwise required by the FIT Contract.

In addition, Launch Period applicants could commit to be ready for commercial
operations up to 365 days earlier than otherwise required by the FIT Contract. Thus, in
total, a Launch Period applicant could bid up to a maximum of 725 COD Acceleration

Days.

2. Other Applications

Applications received after the Launch Period received a time stamp based on the actual
date and time when the OPA received the application. The ranking of these applications
was based solely on their time stamps; these applicants could not advance their rankings
by demonstrating that their projects were shovel-ready.

In order to consolidate launch and post-launch period rankings, the OPA developed a
procedure to translate COD Acceleration Days back into a “time stamp.” As a result, the
top-ranked Launch Period Application, based on the number of COD Acceleration Days
that it had been awarded, would be accorded the “earliest” time stamp. The second
ranked application would be accorded the next earliest, and so on until all the Launch
Period Applications had been ranked. All other applications would then be ranked in

accordance with their actual time stamp.

Any applicant would only be offered a FIT Contract if there was sufficient transmission
capacity available to connect its project to the grid. To determine if there was sufficient
transmission capacity, the OPA would conduct a Transmission Availability Test (“TAT”).

If no capacity was available for the project, the OPA would conduct an Economic

25.

26.

27.

28.

29.

8
9

Connection Test (“ECT”) to determine whether it was economically and technically
feasible to upgrade the transmission system to accommodate the project.

Other requirements had to be satisfied before a project could proceed to development.
These included regulatory approvals, impact assessments, permits and licenses.®

D. MEsa’s APPLICATIONS TO THE FIT PROGRAM

. Mesa filed six applications under the FIT Program.? On 25 November 2009, TTD and

Arran submitted one application each. Each application bid for three criteria points: Major
Equipment Control, Prior Experience and Financial Capacity. Subsequently, on 29 May
2010, North Bruce and Summerhill submitted two applications each. All of Mesa’s
projects were located in the Bruce Region of Ontario.

E. AWARDING FIT CONTRACTS

1. First Round of FIT Contract Offers

. A vast majority of the FIT applications submitted during the Launch Period were

inadequately completed. Rather than rejecting the applications on this basis, the OPA
communicated with the applicants, creating an online tool that would allow them to
supplement or correct the information that they had submitted. Ultimately, the OPA
reviewed a total of 447 Launch Period Applications on their merits.

On 8 April 2010, after the TATs were run to determine whether transmission capacity
was available for the relevant projects, the OPA offered a first round of 184 contracts to
Launch Period Applicants. This represented a total of approximately 2,500 MW of
available capacity. Due to transmission constraints, no contracts were awarded to
projects located in the Bruce region, such as the Claimant's TTD and Arran projects.

2. Second Round of FIT Contract Offers

On 21 December 2010, the OPA published the priority rankings for the 242 applications
that had not received a FIT Contract in April of the same year. The OPA divided the

C-Mem. §114.
Mem. §26.

30.

31.

32.

33.

ranking into “transmission areas” (i.e. regions) and provided an “area ranking.” The
Respondent explains that applicants were placed into these areas on the basis of the
location of the point at which they would connect to the electricity grid (connection point),
not on the basis of the geographic location of the generation facility. According to the
Respondent, dividing the rankings by transmission area was important, in particular
because only a certain amount of power could be put on the transmission lines coming
out of any specific area. Mesa’s TTD and Arran projects were ranked 8" and 9" in the
Bruce Region and 91* and 96" in the province of Ontario. Subsequently, Mesa’s two
Summerhill applications were ranked 318'" and 319", and the two North Bruce

applications were ranked 320" and 321°.

On 24 February 2011, after running the necessary TATs, the OPA offered 40 FIT
Contracts for a total of 872 MW. Once again, because of transmission constraints, no

contracts were awarded in the Bruce Region.

3. Third Round of FIT Contract Offers

Applications which did not receive a FIT Contract because of the lack of transmission
capacity were added to a priority ranking list and were scheduled for an ECT. Before the
ECT, the OPA released a new priority ranking reflecting all applications received up to
and including 4 June 2010.

As noted above, no FIT Contracts had been awarded to projects in the Bruce region due
to transmission constraints. These constraints could only be resolved by the construction
of a new high-voltage transmission line out of the Bruce region (the “Bruce to Milton
Line”). It was estimated that this new line would result in approximately 1,200 MW of
transmission capacity being made available in the Bruce region for all of Ontario’s
renewable energy projects. However, the development of this line was subject to
regulatory approvals, which were only obtained in the summer of 2011.

By this time, much had changed in the Ontario electricity market. For instance, in 2010,
the Government had released its Long Term Energy Plan (the “LTEP”) under which it
established a target of a total of 10,700 MW of renewable energy capacity in Ontario by
2018. Further, the 2011 Supply Mix Directive had directed the OPA to plan to reach this
target with renewables making up 10-15% of the supply mix. The Respondent explains
that, due to the success of the FIT Program, Ontario was rapidly approaching these

34.

35.

36.

37.

38.

targets and it thus became necessary to slow down the pace of its procurement of
renewable energy.

In this context, it was not practical, so argues the Respondent, to run a province-wide
ECT. The Ministry of Energy, in consultation with the OPA, thus drew up a more
“discrete” process specific to the Bruce to Milton Line, “[to] meet developer expectations
by including the relevant components of an ECT, without actually being a province-wide
ECT” (the “Bruce to Milton Allocation Process’).

The Bruce to Milton Allocation Process was put into effect by a direction of the Minister
of Energy on 3 June 2011. The OPA was directed to award FIT Contracts for 750 MW
in the Bruce Region. Further, each project was to be given an opportunity to change its
connection point during a five business-day period starting on 6 June 2011 (the
“Connection Point Amendment Window’). This meant that projects located within the
Bruce Region could select a connection point outside this region and build transmission
lines from their generation facility to the connection point.

After the close of the Connection Point Amendment Window, on 6 July 2011 the OPA
offered 14 FIT Contracts, totalling 749.5 MW. None of the Claimant's projects received
a FIT Contract.

The Claimant contends that the “arbitrary and unfair” design and implementation of the
FIT Program, as well as the directives of the Minister of Energy, ultimately led to it not
being awarded any FIT Contracts.

F. THE GREEN ENERGY INVESTMENT AGREEMENT

As mentioned above, one of the measures taken by the Government in the wake of the
financial crisis was the enactment of the GEGEA. At the same time, the Government
entered into discussions with two Korean companies, Samsung C&T Corporation
(“Samsung”) and Korea Electric Power Corporation (together, the “Korean
Consortium”) regarding a proposal for a major investment in Ontario's renewable
energy sector. These discussions culminated in the signing of a Memorandum of
Understanding (the “MOU”) in December 2008.

A.

On 21 January 2010, the Government and the Korean Consortium entered into the
Green Energy Investment Agreement (“GEIA’). Valued at CAD 7 billion, the GEIA was,
according to Canada, the single largest investment in renewable electricity generation in
the Province's history.

The GEIA required the Korean Consortium to establish and operate manufacturing
facilities for wind and solar generation equipment in Ontario. In exchange, the Korean
Consortium was inter alia guaranteed priority access to 2,500 MW of transmission
capacity in Ontario. The capacity was to be allocated in five phases over five years, with
each phase targeting approximately 500 MW.

In the first phase, on 30 September 2009, the Minister of Energy directed the OPA to
hold 240 MW of transmission capacity in Haldimand County in reserve for the Korean
Consortium, and 260 MW in Essex County and the Municipality of Chatham-Kent jointly.
In the second phase, on 17 September 2010, the Minister of Energy directed the OPA

to hold in reserve 500 MW of transmission capacity in the Bruce Region.

The Claimant contends that the GEIA granted the Korean Consortium “significantly”
better access to Ontario’s energy grid and ultimately led to the Claimant not receiving
any FIT Contracts.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

INITIAL PHASE

On 6 July 2011, Mesa served Canada with a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to
Arbitration under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”).

On 4 October 2011, the Claimant filed a Notice of Arbitration (the “Notice of Arbitration”
or “NoA”) accompanied by Exhibits 1 to 2 and Tabs 1 to 17. In the Notice of Arbitration,

the Claimant sought the following relief:

“a. Damages of not less than CDN$775 million in compensation for loss,
harm, injury, moral damage, loss of reputation, and damage caused by or
resulting from Canada’s breach of its obligations under Part A of Chapter
11 of the NAFTA;

b. Costs of these proceedings, including all professional fees and
disbursements;

c. Fees and expenses incurred to mitigate the effect of the unlawful
governmental measures taken by Canada;

d. Pre-award and post-award interest at a rate to be fixed by the Tribunal;
and

e. Such further relief as counsel may advise and the Tribunal may deem
appropriate.”

On 3 January 2012, the Claimant appointed Judge Charles N. Brower, a national of the
United States, as arbitrator in this case.

On 31 May 2012, the Respondent appointed Mr. Toby T. Landau, QC, a national of the

United Kingdom, as arbitrator in this case.

On 29 June 2012, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(‘ICSID”), acting as appointing authority, appointed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-
Kohler, a national of Switzerland, as Presiding Arbitrator.

Each of the members of the Tribunal subsequently signed a Declaration of Acceptance
and Statement of Independence and Impartiality regarding his or her appointment. In the
further course of the arbitration, on 4 May 2015, the Presiding Arbitrator disclosed that
she was chairing an ICSID arbitration in which Mr. Toby Landau appeared as counsel.

On 16 July 2012, the Presiding Arbitrator informed the Parties that the Tribunal had been
duly constituted and invited the Respondent to submit an Answer to the Notice of
Arbitration by 31 July 2012.

B. WRITTEN PHASE

On 16 July 2012, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal, informing it that some evidentiary
issues may arise in the arbitration “from a Judicial Subpoena issued in the Northern
District of California and a related Non-disclosure Court Order.” The Claimant submitted
the Non-disclosure Order, advising the Tribunal that the Order required it to be “aware
of the need to protect confidentiality of evidence obtained from the US Courts in the
arbitration”, whilst also informing the Tribunal that a “similar type of subpoena was

confirmed by the Courts of the State of Florida earlier this month.”

On 30 July 2012, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Permanent Court of
Arbitration (“PCA”) would act as the administering institution and that a preliminary
hearing would be held on 12 October 2012 in Toronto, Canada.

On 31 July 2012, in response to the Tribunal’s invitation of 16 July 2012, the Respondent
submitted an Outline of Potential Issues.

On 16 August 2012, the Tribunal circulated draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural
Rules to the Parties for their comments and proposed to appoint Mr. Rahul Donde, an
associate with the Presiding Arbitrator’s law firm in Geneva, as Secretary of the Tribunal.
On 31 August 2012, the Parties confirmed that they had no objection to Mr. Donde’s
appointment.

On 30 August 2012, the Claimant informed the Respondent that, further to a court order
issued in the Northern District of California, it had received documents from Pattern
Energy Group LP, on which it intended to rely in this arbitration. The Claimant further
informed the Respondent that the Federal Court for the Northern District of California
had issued a Protective Order with respect to the relevant documents that the
Respondent would be required to accept if it wished to see the documents. The Claimant
also advised that if the Respondent did not agree to those terms, the Protective Order
provided for the resolution of that issue by the Tribunal. On 7 September 2012, the
Respondent refused to sign the Protective Order and “reserve[d] all [its] rights to
comment on the admissibility and confidentiality of [those] materials, should the Claimant
seek to introduce them in this arbitration.”

On 10 September 2012, the Parties submitted to the Tribunal their comments on the
draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules. In addition, the Respondent
submitted a draft Confidentiality Order.

In its comments of 10 September 2012, Canada proposed that the Tribunal select either
Toronto or Calgary as the legal seat of the arbitration. On 14 September 2012, the
Tribunal invited the Claimant to respond to such comments by 21 September 2012. On
21 September 2012, the Claimant proposed that the Tribunal select either New York or
Washington D.C. as the legal seat of the arbitration.

In its communication of 21 September 2012, the Claimant referred to proceedings which
it had initiated in the United States pursuant to 28 USC § 1782 (Assistance to foreign

58.

59.

60.

and international tribunals and to litigants before such tribunals) (“Section 1782”), and
informed the Tribunal that it intended to offer as evidence “documents demonstrating
Canada’s breaches pursuant to court proceedings in the United States.” It also
requested the Tribunal to order Canada to “maintain and adhere to the confidentiality
agreements that are annexed to the US court orders.” The Claimant submitted to the
Tribunal orders from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California
and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida requiring the
Claimant “to seek agreement from Canada to maintain disclosed documents
confidential” and proposed certain modifications to the Respondent's draft
Confidentiality Order. On 28 September 2012, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to
comment on the Claimant's communication of 21 September 2012.

On 5 October 2012, the Respondent rejected the Claimant's suggested modifications to
the draft Confidentiality Order and submitted that it “should not be ordered to adhere to
the Protective Orders entered by the US district courts.”

On 12 October 2012, the Tribunal held a first procedural hearing in Toronto. The hearing
was attended by Mr. Barry Appleton, Dr. Alan Alexandroff, and Ms. Kyle Dickson-Smith
for the Claimant, and Ms. Sylvie Tabet, Mr. Shane Spelliscy, Mr. Michael Owen, Mr. lan
Philp, Ms. Heather Squires, and Ms. Jennifer Hopkins for the Respondent. During the
hearing both Parties made submissions in particular with regard to the legal seat of the
arbitration. The Claimant submitted that it may be necessary to subpoena witnesses and
to seek the assistance of local courts to secure documents in the hands of third parties
in the US, and therefore the Tribunal should select a US seat. By contrast, the
Respondent argued in favor of a seat in Canada.

On 16 October 2012, the Tribunal directed the Parties to make further submissions with
regard to the legal seat of the arbitration by 26 October 2012, with the option of filing
responses by 2 November 2012. The Parties filed submissions on the legal seat of the
arbitration on 26 October 2012 and on 2 November 2012.

On 1 November 2012, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal “provide a supporting
letter that can be filed before the District Court for the Southern District of Florida,
confirming the Tribunal’s ability to use the documents received under the Section 1782
process.” On the same day, the Tribunal confirmed that it had the authority to rule on the
admission and use in the arbitration of documents that the Claimant had obtained

pursuant to the order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of

62.

California. The Tribunal also invited the Claimant “to apply to the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Florida to confirm that...[the] Tribunal [had] the authority
to govern the use of the...documents” obtained pursuant to the order of that court. The
Tribunal also circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1 (“PO 1”) and a revised draft of
the Confidentiality Order for the Parties’ comments.

On 9 November 2012, the Respondent provided its comments on the draft PO 1 and the
draft Confidentiality Order. It also presented three requests seeking (i) confirmation that
the Tribunal had not ruled on the Respondent's objection raised on 5 October 2012; (ii)
if the Section 1782 documents were admissible, confirmation that the determination
would not apply to any transcripts of witness testimony; and (iii) confirmation that further
efforts by the Claimant to obtain evidence using Section 1782 should be pursued only

under the supervision of the Tribunal.

On 13 November 2012, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide its comments on
such requests, which Mesa did on 19 November 2012.

On 21 November 2012, the Tribunal issued the final version of PO 1, which, inter alia,
confirmed the composition of the Tribunal, the appointment of Mr. Rahul Donde as
Secretary of the Tribunal, and the appointment of the PCA as administering institution.
Annex B to PO 1 established the procedural calendar for the further proceedings.

On the same day, the Tribunal also issued the final version of the Confidentiality Order.
The Order allowed the Parties to designate information in written submissions as
“Confidential” or “Restricted Access”, in which case they would be required to file a
“Confidential” or “Restricted Access” version of the relevant submissions within certain
deadlines. The Order further specified that, if a Party did not agree with the other's
designation of information as “Confidential” or “Restricted Access”, it could submit the

issue for resolution to the Tribunal.

On 22 November 2012, responding to the Tribunal’s invitation of 1 November 2012, the
Claimant submitted to the Tribunal a draft letter to the United States District Court for the

Southern District of Florida.

On 26 November 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had received an order
from the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey granting its Section
1782 application to obtain certain documents and information from Samsung C&T

68.

America, Inc. and that it would bring the Tribunal’s Confidentiality Order to the attention
of the New Jersey District Court.

On 27 November 2012, the Respondent reiterated its requests of 9 November 2012 and
also informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to the content of the draft letter to the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida proposed by the Claimant.

On the same day, the Parties sent the Tribunal a copy of the Confidentiality Order signed
by the Parties.

On 3 December 2012, in accordance with the procedural calendar set forth in Annex B
to PO 1, the Respondent submitted a Request for Bifurcation accompanied by legal
authorities (RL-1 to RL-14) and an Objection to Jurisdiction accompanied by Exhibits R-
1 to R-20 and legal authorities (RL-15 to RL-38).

On 24 December 2012, the Claimant submitted a Response on Bifurcation.

On 18 January 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (“PO 2”), containing its
decision to bifurcate the proceedings into two phases, concerning “(i) the jurisdictional
objection based on the alleged failure of the Claimant to comply with Article 1120(1) of
the NAFTA, and (ii) the merits of the case and any and all other jurisdictional objections
that may arise.” The Tribunal reserved its power to re-join the Respondent's jurisdictional
objection to the merits of the case following review of the Parties’ further submissions.

On 19 February 2013, the Claimant submitted an Answer to Canada’s Preliminary
Objections on Jurisdiction (“Answer on Jurisdiction’).

On 23 February 2013, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had received an
Amended Protective Order from the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Florida in respect of documents produced by NextEra Energy Resources, LLC in
response to the Claimant's Section 1782 application before that court, and sought leave
to file additional documents supporting the arguments set out in its Answer on
Jurisdiction.

On 26 February 2013, the Respondent reiterated its previous requests with regard to its
challenges to the admissibility of documents that Mesa had obtained under Section

76.

77.

78.

79.

80.

81.

1782, and also requested the Tribunal to direct the Claimant to identify any Section 1782
documents already in the record and to strike those documents from the record.

Still on 26 February 2013, the Claimant filed a public version of its Answer on
Jurisdiction. On 27 February 2013, Canada objected that the Claimant’s designation of
information as “Confidential” in its Answer on Jurisdiction failed to comply with the
provisions of the Tribunal’s Confidentiality Order. On the same day, the Claimant
submitted a new version of its Answer on Jurisdiction seeking to address the issues
raised by the Respondent.

On 27 February 2013, the Claimant submitted comments on the Respondent’s requests
regarding Section 1782 documents.

On 28 February 2013, a telephone conference took place, during which the Tribunal
heard the Parties’ views on the continuation of the bifurcation.

On the same day, the Claimant submitted a copy of the order issued by the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey in respect of documents produced by
Samsung C&T America, Inc. in response to the Claimant's Section 1782 application
before that court.

On 28 March 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (“PO 3”) in which it
dismissed the Respondent's challenge to the admissibility of all Section 1782 documents
and selected Miami, Florida, as the legal seat of the arbitration. It chose Miami over other
alternatives proposed by the Parties because of the possibility to issue subpoenas and
seek the assistance of the courts in procuring evidence of third parties located in the US.
This was on the basis that that Claimant had represented that key evidence was located
within the State of Florida and wanted the option to call upon the Tribunal and local
courts to exercise powers to secure the same. Finally, having had the benefit of the
Claimant's Answer on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded that it would not be possible
to rule on the application of Article 1120(1) in the abstract without substantially engaging
in the facts of the dispute. It thus discontinued the bifurcation ordered in PO 2, and set
forth an amended procedural calendar.

On 17 April 2013, the Parties exchanged their requests for document production.

On 23 April 2013, Mesa informed the Tribunal that the United States District Court for
the District of New Jersey had granted part of its Section 1782 application seeking
documents from the Korea Electric Power Corporation.

On 21 May 2013, the Parties exchanged their reasoned objections to each other's
document production requests.

On 10 June 2013, the Claimant submitted a Request for Particulars, asking the Tribunal
to direct the Respondent to provide “factual particulars” (along with documents,
communications and files) relating to the Respondent's submissions on jurisdiction and
on the merits. On the same day, Canada requested that the Tribunal grant it until 19
June 2013 to respond, which the Tribunal did on 13 June 2013.

On 11 June 2013, each of the Parties submitted a Redfern Schedule containing its
document production requests, the other side’s objections, and its replies.

On the same day, the Respondent submitted two further requests. One concerned the
Claimant’s designation of certain information as “Restricted Access” or “Confidential.”
The other sought a modification of PO 1 to allow it to produce documents to the Claimant
only in electronic format. On 13 June 2013, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to comment
on these requests by 19 June 2013.

On 19 June 2013, Canada submitted its comments on the Claimant's Request for
Particulars, arguing that it should be rejected. On the same day, the Claimant submitted
its comments on the Respondent's requests in connection with the designation of
information and electronic production.

On 27 June 2013, the Tribunal, on the Claimant's request and with the Respondent's
consent, modified the schedule for the subsequent pleadings of the Parties.

On 12 July 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (“PO 4”), denying Mesa’s
Request for Particulars; deciding the Parties’ document production requests; denying
the Respondent's request to produce documents to the Claimant only electronically; and
deciding the Respondent's request concerning the Claimant’s designation of certain
information.

On 2 August 2013, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to request an extension of the
time limit for the production of documents with respect to “IESO”, Hydro One and the
OPA set by PO 4. On the same day, the Tribunal invited the Claimant’s comments on
the Respondent's request. The Claimant provided its comments on 6 August 2013,
objecting to the Respondent's request, but agreeing to a 30-day extension for the
Respondent's document production. Additionally, the Claimant submitted two requests
of its own, asking the Tribunal (i) to order that the Respondent disclose “all of its
correspondence with the [OPA], Hydro One, and the IESO, relating to document
disclosure and production, and correspondence with Ontario on the same issue”, and (ii)
to “draw an adverse inference against [the Respondent] from any non-production of
relevant documents.” On 7 August 2013, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would
soon issue a ruling and suspended the document production time limit until then.

On 23 August 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 (“PO 5”), granting the
Respondent's request for an extension of the time limit with regard to document
production and denying the Claimant's requests.

On 28 August 2013, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal to request leave to proceed with
its Section 1782 applications before the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Florida and the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

On the same day, the Tribunal asked the Claimant for the court applications which it
intended to file in the Section 1782 proceedings. On 2 November 2013, the Claimant
submitted that the Tribunal should order that the applications be treated as “Restricted
Access” information and that Canada undertake not to communicate with any non-
disputing party regarding “any issues related to the completed applications” until after
they had been filed. In its response of 8 November 2013, the Respondent objected to
this submission.

On 20 November 2013, the Claimant submitted its Memorial accompanied by Exhibits
C-1 to C-421, legal authorities (Exhibits CL-1 to CL-202), one witness statement and
one expert report.

On 25 November 2013, the Respondent submitted that the designation of certain
information by the Claimant in its Memorial as “Restricted Access” was inappropriate. It
requested, inter alia, that the Tribunal order the Claimant to correct all the inappropriate

designations in the Memorial and to provide a brief justification for those designations
that it wished to maintain.

On 4 December 2013, the Tribunal denied the Claimant’s request of 2 November 2013
to designate the Claimant's Section 1782 applications as “Restricted Access”
information.

On 9 December 2013, Canada requested the Tribunal to (i) strike certain portions of the
Claimant’s Memorial and certain supporting documents on the basis that “they refer to
and rely upon witness testimony obtained and submitted by the Claimant contrary to the
established procedures in this arbitration and to Canada’s due process rights’; (ii) “strike
Part V, Jurisdiction, of the Claimant’s Memorial as it contains new and unauthorized
submissions by the Claimant relating to Canada’s jurisdictional objection regarding the
Claimant’s failure to respect the ‘cooling-off’ period under NAFTA”; (iii) order the
production of certain documents responsive to the Respondent's original document
production requests of 17 April 2013; and (iv) order the Claimant to provide the
Respondent with the Excel model used by the Claimant’s damages experts.

On 10 December 2013, the Claimant submitted its Section 1782 applications.

On 16 December 2013, the Claimant submitted a response to the Respondent's
requests of 9 December 2013.

On the same day, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, deciding the issues raised in the
Respondent's 25 November 2013 submission and providing certain directions with
regard to future designations of the Parties.

On 20 December 2013, the Respondent commented on the Claimant’s Section 1782
applications, and requested the Tribunal to (i) “[rlefuse to authorize the Claimant to
proceed with further evidence gathering in the United States from Nextera and
Samsung’; (ii) make certain determinations in relation to designations; and (iii) grant the
Respondent an extension of the time limit for its Counter-Memorial. The Respondent
also objected to some of the Claimant's designations in its Memorial.

On 23 December 2013, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal in relation to its “Confidential”

and “Restricted Access” designations.

On 24 December 2013, Mesa requested the Tribunal to strike certain confidentiality
designations by the Respondent and to direct the latter to produce certain documents
which it had withheld for lack of consent from third parties.

On 30 December 2013, the Tribunal conveyed its decisions on a number of outstanding
requests made by the Parties and advised the Parties that the reasons for its decisions
would follow. Specifically, the Tribunal (i) denied the Respondent’s request to strike
portions of the Claimant's Memorial; (ii) denied the Respondent’s request to strike
arguments relating to the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections in the Claimant's
Memorial; (iii) ordered the Claimant to produce certain documents requested by the
Respondent, whilst denying other document production requests; (iv) directed the
Claimant to produce the Excel model used by the Claimant’s damages experts; and (v)
denied the Claimant's request to approve its proposed Section 1782 applications in the
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Florida, noting that the Claimant “[might] revive its
request at a later stage.”

On 3 January 2014, Canada wrote to the Tribunal, (i) making certain requests with
regard to confidentiality designations; (ii) requesting the Tribunal to deny the Claimant's
requests regarding the production of certain documents by the Respondent made in the
Claimant's letter of 24 December 2013; and (iii) requesting the Tribunal to order the
Claimant to submit into the record the entire transcript of the deposition of Mr. Colin
Edwards, which evidence the Claimant had obtained through its Section 1782
applications.

On 8 January 2014, Mesa “declassified” 60% of the designations challenged on
20 December 2013, but maintained its position on the remaining designations.

On 15 January 2014, the Claimant responded to the Respondent's letter of 3 January
2014 and specified its requested relief with regard to the issues raised in that letter.

On 16 January 2014, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's submission of

15 January 2014 as being unauthorized and requested the Tribunal to strike it from the
record.

and 3 of the Confidentiality Order in respect of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial and
supporting documents pending the resolution by the Tribunal of the outstanding disputes
between the Parties in relation to designations. On the same day, the Claimant objected
to the Respondent's request. The Tribunal granted the suspension sought “for the time

being‘, whilst inviting the Claimant to provide its comments by 6 March 2014.

On 28 February 2014, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial and Reply on
Jurisdiction (“Counter-Memorial”) accompanied by Exhibits R-21 to R-173, legal

authorities (RL-39 to RL-76), six witness statements and two expert reports.

On 3 March 2014, the Claimant commented on the Respondent's request of 27 February
2014.

On 5 March 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 (“PO 6”), providing
reasons for the Tribunal’s decision of 30 December 2013. The Tribunal also rendered
decisions on the requests of the Claimant dated 28 August 2013, 24 December 2013,
and 8 and 15 January 2014, as well as on the Respondent's requests dated 9 December
2013. In addition, the Tribunal requested Mesa to submit a revised version of its

testimonial evidence that supports its written submission.”

of the various pending requests from the Parties.

On 10 April 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 (“PO 7”), denying the
Claimant’s Motion for Summary Determination and its application for further document
production and giving the Parties an option to make document requests after the

On 23 May 2014, the Claimant responded to the challenges filed by the Respondent on
16 May 2014; filed a revised version of its expert report; and designated additional

The next day, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had no objections to such
designations.

Still on 27 May 2014, the Respondent requested the production of certain excel models

On 2 July 2014, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits (the “Rejoinder’).
The Rejoinder was accompanied by Exhibits R-174 to R-196, legal authorities (RL-77 to
RL-113), five witness statements and one expert report.

On 4 July 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 (“PO 11”) in which it ruled
on Mesa’s challenges to additional confidentiality designations proposed by the
Respondent with regard to the Reply Memorial and directed the Claimant to produce a
re-designated Reply Memorial and supporting documents by 11 July 2014, as well as a
public version of these documents by 18 July 2014.

On 11 July 2014, the Claimant submitted a re-designated public version as well as an
amended “Restricted Access” and “Confidential” version of its Reply Memorial.

On 22 July 2014, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to determine that the
information contained in certain exhibits provided by the Claimant was public.

On 23 July 2014, the Claimant submitted a Request to Produce Documents to the
Respondent pursuant to the possibility contemplated in PO 7.

On 26 July 2014, the United States and Mexico each filed their Article 1128 Submissions.

On 28 July 2014, the Claimant designated certain additional information in the
Respondent's Rejoinder and supporting documents as “Confidential.”

On 29 July 2014, Mesa advised the Tribunal that there was no further information to
provide with respect to the Section 1782 proceedings.

On 30 July 2014, the Tribunal granted the Respondent’s request of 22 July 2014 in
respect of public access to information contained in certain exhibits provided by the
Claimant.

On 1 August 2014, the Respondent provided an update about the production of
documents in the possession of IESO, the OPA and Hydro One. It noted that IESO and
the OPA had received consent from NextEra to the disclosure of certain information in
the arbitration. Since NextEra’s consent was conditional on the designation of the
relevant documents as “Restricted Access”, the Respondent requested the express
agreement of the Tribunal and the Claimant to such designation.

On 2 August 2014, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to request an extension of the
time limit to produce documents pursuant to PO 4.

On 5 August 2014, the Claimant consented to the Respondent's request of 1 August
2014 to designate certain documents as “Restricted Access.” On 6 August 2014, the
Tribunal also consented to the Respondent's request.

On the same day, Canada objected to all the document production requests submitted
by the Claimant on 23 July 2014.

On 7 August 2014, the Respondent challenged designations made on 28 July 2014 by
the Claimant regarding the Rejoinder and supporting documents. On 12 August 2014,
the Claimant replied to such challenges.

On the same day, Mesa submitted a “Motion to Strike.” It pointed out that in its Rejoinder,
the Respondent had raised a new argument that if the Tribunal accepted the Claimant's
position that the FIT Program was a form of government assistance, then the Program
would constitute a subsidy, with the result that Articles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b) would
preclude the application of Articles 1102, 1103 and 1106 of the NAFTA (the “Subsidy
Defense”). The Claimant requested the Tribunal (i) to strike the Respondent’s Subsidy
Defense because it was raised late or (ii) in the alternative, to grant the Claimant the
right to a sur-reply and additional information requests.

On 18 August 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 (“PO 12”), ruling on
the Respondent's challenges to designations proposed by the Claimant in relation to the

Rejoinder and supporting documents. PO 12 also directed the Claimant to produce a
public version of the Rejoinder and supporting documents by 25 August 2014.

On the next day, the Respondent submitted its response to the Claimant’s Motion to
Strike and asked the Tribunal to deny the motion.

On 20 August 2014, the Claimant submitted its response to Canada’s objections to its
document production request of 23 July 2014.

On 25 August 2014, the Claimant submitted a public version of the Rejoinder and
supporting documents.

On 27 August 2014, Canada reiterated its request that the Tribunal dismiss the
Claimant's Motion to Strike.

On the same day, the Claimant submitted a Response to the Article 1128 Submissions
of the non-disputing parties accompanied by Exhibits C-659 to C-691 and legal
authorities (CL-344 to CL-392).

On 2 September 2014, Canada wrote with respect to the Claimant's Response to the
Article 1128 Submissions of the non-disputing parties. It requested that the exhibits
accompanying the Claimant’s submission be struck from the record and that the time for
the Respondent to designate information in these exhibits as “Confidential” or to object
to the Claimant's confidentiality designations be suspended until the Tribunal ruled on
its request.

On 4 September 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13 (“PO 13”) on Mesa’s
document production requests. The Tribunal confirmed that, in accordance with PO 7,
the Respondent should produce all the relevant documents on or before 17 September
2014.

On the same day, the Tribunal denied Mesa’s Motion to Strike and set out a procedure
for the Parties to address the Respondent's Subsidy Defense.

On 5 September 2014, Mesa objected to the procedure on the Subsidy Defense and

requested certain clarifications from the Tribunal. On 8 September 2014, the Tribunal
replied with regard to these clarifications and authorized the Parties to further comment

27

172.

173.

174.

on the procedure to deal with the Subsidy Defense. By communications dated 11 and
15 September, respectively, the Claimant and the Respondent offered such further
comments.

On 16 September 2014, a pre-hearing conference call took place between the Parties
and the Presiding Arbitrator to discuss outstanding procedural and organizational
matters for the forthcoming hearing. A second procedural call involving the full Tribunal
took place on 22 September 2014.

On 22 September 2014, the Claimant submitted its Observations on Canada’s Subsidy
Exception Defense accompanied by Exhibit C-692 and legal authorities (CL-393 to CL-
420).

On 26 September 2014, the Tribunal provided for a procedure and time limits for the
admission of new documents into the record. On 1 October 2014, the Claimant filed
supplemental Exhibits C-693 to C-714. On the same day, the Respondent filed additional
Exhibits R-197 to R-206 and designated certain “Confidential” and “Restricted Access”
information.

On 3 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14 (“PO 14”) dealing with
organizational and procedural matters with regard to the hearing. PO 14 also gave the
Respondent an opportunity to address the exhibits filed by the Claimant together with its
comments on the Article 1128 Submissions.

On 6 October 2014, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to clarify the procedures for
designating “Confidential” and “Restricted Access” information contained in the exhibits
submitted by the Parties on 1 October 2014 and in exhibits that Mesa had submitted with
its responses to the Article 1128 Submissions of the United States and Mexico.

On the same day, Canada submitted its response to the arguments raised by the
Claimant in its Observations on Canada’s Subsidy Defense.

On 10 October 2014, the Respondent submitted designations with regard to the

Claimant's additional exhibits filed on 1 October 2014 and the exhibits attached to the

Claimant’s Response to the Article 1128 Submissions.

. In letters to the Parties of 9 and 14 October 2014, the Tribunal established timelines with
regard to the challenges to the Parties’ designations relating to the exhibits filed by the
Claimant on 1 October 2014 and the exhibits attached to the Claimant's Response to
the Article 1128 Submissions. Also on 14 October 2014, the Tribunal informed the
Parties that the United States and Mexico had expressed an intention to attend the
forthcoming hearing and requested the Parties’ views in this regard.

On 20 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 (“PO 15”) in which it
determined the Parties’ challenges regarding designations in the exhibits filed by the
Claimant on 1 October 2014 and the exhibits attached to the Claimant's comments on
the Article 1128 Submissions.

On 31 March 2015, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal with regard to the Claimant's
Reply Statement of Costs. On the same day, the Claimant responded to the
Respondent's letter.

On 6 April 2015, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that on 17 March 2015 the award in
Bilcon v. Government of Canada had been released. The Claimant enclosed a copy of
the award and dissenting opinion and requested that it be admitted as a supplemental
authority. On 15 April 2015, Canada opposed such request and, in the event that the
award were to be accepted into the record stated that “under Article 1128, the United
States and Mexico must also be afforded the opportunity to offer any comments they
have on the interpretation of NAFTA contained in the Bilcon award.” On 16 April 2015,
Mesa commented and requested that Canada’s request not to admit the Bilcon award
be denied. On the next day, the Respondent objected to such letter as an unauthorized
submission.

On 29 April 2015, the Parties agreed to the publication of redacted versions of the video
footage and transcripts from the hearing on the PCA’s website.

On 4 May 2015, the Tribunal invited the Parties’ observations on the relevance and
impact of the Bilcon award and dissenting opinion for purposes of this arbitration as well
as on the Respondent’s submission of 15 April 2015 that the United States and Mexico
be given the opportunity to offer their comments on the award.

On 14 May 2015, the United States and Mexico separately notified the Tribunal that they
would present Article 1128 Submissions to the Tribunal on issues of NAFTA
interpretation raised in Bilcon.

On the same day, the Parties submitted their observations on the Bilcon award.
On the next day, the Claimant sought leave to comment on the requests of the non-
disputing parties regarding Article 1128 submissions. By letter to the Parties dated

18 May 2015, the Tribunal granted the Claimant the opportunity to comment on the
admissibility of further Article 1128 submissions.

On 19 May 2015, the Claimant wrote a letter to the Tribunal addressing the admissibility
of the proposed Article 1128 submissions accompanied by legal authorities (CL-344 to
CL-357). In its letter, the Claimant opposed further submissions by the non-disputing
parties.

On 26 May 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it accepted additional
submissions of the United States and Mexico on Bilcon and that the Parties were

authorized to provide their comments on those submissions by 26 June 2015.

On 12 June 2015, the United States and Mexico filed Article 1128 Submissions related
to the interpretation of the NAFTA in the Bilcon award.

On 16 June 2015, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that a document pertaining to the
12 June 2015 Article 1128 Submission of the United States, namely the Article 1128
Submission filed by the Government of Mexico on 8 May 2015 in Mercer International
Inc. v. Government of Canada, “[did] not appear to be available to the public.” The
Claimant requested “that the Government of the United States either immediately
produce this document upon which it relies or alternatively that the reference to this
secret document be struck in its entirety from the US Second Article 1128 Submission.”

On the following day, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on the Article 1128
Submissions by 26 June 2015. The Tribunal also invited Canada to comment on the
Claimant’s 16 June 2015 requests by the same date.

Still on 17 June 2015, the United States submitted the Article 1128 Submission filed by
Mexico in Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada. On 18 June 2015, the
Tribunal wrote to the Parties, indicating its understanding that this communication
satisfied the concerns which Mesa had expressed two days earlier.

On 26 June 2015, the Claimant and the Respondent provided their comments on the
Article 1128 Submissions, the Claimant's comments being accompanied by legal
authorities (CL-421 to CL-432).

The Tribunal closed the proceedings on 24 March 2016.

In accordance with paragraph 22.1 of PO 1 and following the redaction of confidential
information, the PCA has published or will publish on its website the Parties’ memorials

32

and other written submissions, the hearing transcripts and video recording, the

procedural orders, and this Award.

IV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND RELIEF REQUESTED

A. SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

207. As mentioned above, the dispute arises out of the alleged arbitrary and unfair application

of various government measures related to the regulation and production of renewable

energy in Ontario.'t According to the Claimant, the “manipulation” of the FIT Program

prevented it from obtaining FIT Contracts, and caused loss and damage to Mesa and its

related business operations.

208. In essence, the Claimant contends that Ontario and thereby Canada:

In violation of Article 1106 of the NAFTA, imposed minimum domestic
content requirements on the Claimant;

In violation of Articles 1102 and 1103 of the NAFTA, treated the
Claimant and its investments less favourably than other investors in
like circumstances;

In violation of Article 1104 of the NAFTA, failed to provide to the
Claimant and/or its investments the better treatment required under
Articles 1102 and 1103; and,

In violation of Article 1105 of the NAFTA, failed to treat the Claimant's
investments in accordance with the international law standard of
treatment.

209. While the Claimant initially made claims in respect of Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA, these
claims were later withdrawn. 1

11 NoA §6.

12 Reply §§870-871 (“In its Memorial the Investor pleaded that Canada was responsible for the acts of
the Ontario Power Authority, IESO, and Hydro One under Article 1503(2), concerning state enterprises.

The Investor no longer maintains these claims under NAFTA Article 1503(2). Instead it maintains its
claims on the same measures under Chapter Eleven.”).

33

210. The Claimant's detailed arguments in so far as they are relevant and necessary to
resolve the issues in dispute are summarized prior to the Tribunal’s analysis of each
disputed issue below. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal emphasizes that, while it has
reproduced only the most relevant allegations and arguments for its decision, it has
considered all of the Claimant's submissions and evidence.

B. THE CLAIMANT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF

211. In its post-hearing brief, the Claimant sought the following relief:

“In view of the facts and law set out in the written submissions and during the oral
hearing, the Investor respectfully requests that the Tribunal grant the following relief:
i. To dismiss Canada’s admissibility and jurisdictional objections in their
entirety;

ii. A Declaration that Canada has acted in a breached [sic] its
obligations under NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103,1104, 1105 and
1106;

iii. | An award of damages for the losses that were caused by those
breaches of the NAFTA, for moral damages and for pre and post-
award interest compounded at a rate to be determined by the
Tribunal; and

iv. An award in favour of the Investor for its costs, disbursements and
expenses incurred in the arbitration for legal representation and
assistance, plus interest, and for the costs of the Tribunal.”'>

212. This request for relief was substantially similar to the Claimant’s earlier requests for
relief."

C. SUMMARY OF THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

213. The Respondent first submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute
because the Claimant failed to comply with the mandatory pre-requisites for the
submission of a dispute to arbitration under Chapter 11 of the NAFTA. Even if the
Tribunal disagreed on this point, the Respondent contends that it would still lack
jurisdiction over the claims arising out of measures in existence prior to the Claimant's
investment in Canada. It would also lack jurisdiction over claims relating to the impugned
acts of state enterprises like the OPA.

14 Mem. §962; Reply §917.

34

214.

215.

216.

217.

218.

. The Respondent next submits that even if the Tribunal found that it has jurisdiction over
the present dispute; the Claimant has failed to establish that Canada has breached its
NAFTA obligations. According to the Respondent, the FIT Program constitutes
“government procurement” under Articles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b). Consequently,
Canada has no obligations under Articles 1102, 1103 or 1106 of the NAFTA. In any
event, even if the Tribunal were to find that the FIT Program did not constitute
procurement, the claims would fail as Mesa has “fundamentally misconstrued” these
provisions.

The Respondent also denies that it has violated any of its obligations under Article 1105.
It submits that the Claimant's applications to the FIT Program were fairly and reasonably
assessed. Further, the FIT Program was adapted over the years to meet changing
market conditions and policy objectives, and “there is nothing manifestly arbitrary, unfair
or unjust” about this. In respect of the GEIA, the Respondent submits that “[t]here is
nothing manifestly arbitrary, grossly unjust, egregious or shocking about a government
entering into an investment agreement in which it accords certain advantages to a
particular investor in exchange for certain investment commitments by that investor.”

In the event that the Tribunal were to find that Canada has breached the NAFTA, the
Respondent contends that the damages claimed are significantly inflated. Most of the
alleged losses claimed by Mesa were not caused by the Respondent, but by the
Claimant’s own business failures.

Canada’s detailed arguments in so far as they are relevant and necessary to resolve the
issues in dispute are summarised below prior to the Tribunal’s analysis of each disputed
issue. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal emphasizes that, while it has only referred to
the most important submissions for its decision, it has considered all of the Respondent's
submissions and evidence.

D. THE RESPONDENT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF

. In the Rejoinder, the Respondent sought the following relief:

18 C-Mem. §406.

35

“Canada respectfully requests that the Tribunal dismiss the Claimant's claims in their
entirety and with prejudice, order that the Claimant bear the costs of this arbitration,
including Canada’s costs for legal representation and assistance, and grant any
further relief it deems just and proper.”

219. This request for relief was substantially similar to the Respondent's earlier request for
relief.1”

Vv. ANALYSIS

A. PRELIMINARY MATTERS

220. Prior to addressing the merits of the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal will address certain
preliminary matters: the relevance of previous decisions or awards (1); the applicable
legal framework (2); and the burden of proof (3).

1. Relevance of Previous Decisions and Awards

221. In support of their positions, both Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards,
either to conclude that the same solutions should be adopted in the present case or in
an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from a solution reached by another
tribunal.

222. The Tribunal is not bound by the decisions of other arbitral tribunals. At the same time
however, the Tribunal does believe that it should pay due respect to such decisions.
Unless there are reasons to the contrary, the Tribunal will adopt the approaches
established in a series of consistent cases comparable to the case at hand, subject, of
course, to the specifics of the NAFTA and to the circumstances of the actual case. By
doing so, the Tribunal believes it will meet its duty to contribute to the harmonious
development of investment law and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the
community of States and investors towards legal certainty and the rule of law.

2. Applicable Legal Framework

a. Law Governing the Procedure

. Article 1120(2) of the NAFTA and paragraph 8 of PO 1 deal with the applicable
procedural framework in the following terms:

“[T]he applicable arbitration rules shall govern the arbitration except to the
extent modified by this Section” (Art. 1120(2)).

“8.1 The procedure in this arbitration shall be governed by the 1976
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules except as modified by the provisions of
Section B of Chapter 11 of the NAFTA (per Article 1120(2) of the NAFTA).

8.2 If these provisions and rules do not address a specific procedural
issue, the Tribunal shall, after consultation with the Parties, determine the
applicable procedure. In addition, the Tribunal may seek guidance from,
but shall not be bound by, the 2010 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence
in International Commercial Arbitration” (Paragraph 8 PO 1).

The applicable procedural rules are thus the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
(‘UNCITRAL Rules’), except to the extent that they are modified by the provisions of
Section B of NAFTA Chapter 11.

In addition, the Tribunal recalls that the legal seat of the arbitration is Miami, Florida,
which may trigger the application of certain mandatory rules of international arbitration
law applicable at the seat.

b. Law Governing Jurisdiction
The jurisdiction of this Tribunal must primarily be governed by the NAFTA as this is the
instrument by which Canada has expressed its offer to arbitrate, which the Claimant has
accepted, thereby achieving consent.
Chapter 11 contains a choice of law which is quoted below and according to which the

issues in dispute must be resolved in accordance with the NAFTA and “applicable rules

of international law.”

37

c. Law Governing the Merits

228. Article 33(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that an arbitral tribunal must “apply the

22!

231

23

S

law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute.”

Article 1131 of the NAFTA contains a choice of law clause as follows, which is also

reproduced in paragraph 7.1 of PO 1:

“Article 1131: Governing Law

1. A Tribunal established under this Section shall decide the issues in
dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of
international law.

2. An interpretation by the Commission of a provision of this Agreement
shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section.”

Accordingly, the Tribunal will resolve the merits of this dispute by application of the
NAFTA and relevant rules of international law. As will be further discussed in the context
of Article 1105, the Tribunal will also follow interpretations issued by the NAFTA Free
Trade Commission (the “FTC”), specifically the 31 July 2001 “Notes of Interpretation of
Certain Chapter Eleven Provisions” (the “FTC Note”).

d. Principles of Interpretation

. Article 102 of the NAFTA sets out the objectives of the treaty and provides that the latter

must be interpreted with these objectives in mind:

“Article 102: Objectives

1. The objectives of this Agreement, as elaborated more specifically through
its principles and rules, including national treatment, most-favored-nation
treatment and transparency, are to:

a) eliminate barriers to trade in, and facilitate the cross-border movement of,
goods and services between the territories of the Parties;

b) promote conditions of fair competition in the free trade area;

c) increase substantially investment opportunities in the territories of the
Parties;

d) provide adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual
property rights in each Party's territory;

e) create effective procedures for the implementation and application of this
Agreement, for its joint administration and for the resolution of disputes; and
f) establish a framework for further trilateral, regional and multilateral
cooperation to expand and enhance the benefits of this Agreement.

38

2. The Parties shall interpret and apply the provisions of this Agreement in
the light of its objectives set out in paragraph 1 and in accordance with
applicable rules of international law.”

232. Among the “applicable rules of international law” referred to in paragraph 2 of the
provision just quoted, one counts Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties (the “VCLT” or “Vienna Convention”),'® which codify customary

international law in the following terms:

“Article 31. General Rule of Interpretation

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light
of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise,
in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the
parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion
with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an
instrument related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes
the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between
the parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the
parties so intended.”

And:

“Article 32. Supplementary Means of Interpretation

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including
the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion,
in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31,
or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:

(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.”

18 Exh. CL-11.

39

233. On this basis, the Tribunal will interpret the provisions of the NAFTA in accordance with
the rules on treaty interpretation of the VCLT, taking into account the objectives of the
NAFTA as they are set forth in Article 102(1).

3. Burden of Proof

234. Both Parties have made submissions on the allocation of the burden of proof in respect
of jurisdiction and merits. Mesa submits that the Respondent bears the burden of proof
for the jurisdictional defenses it raises.'® On its part, the Respondent submits that the
Claimant bears the burden of establishing that this Tribunal has jurisdiction over the
present dispute. It also points out that where there is any ambiguity about whether it has
jurisdiction or not, a tribunal should decline to act.

235. The Tribunal recalls that Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules contains the rules
applicable with respect to which Party bears the burden of proof. It provides:

“Each party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support
his claim or defence.”

236. Thus, each Party must establish the facts on which it relies in support of its claims and
defenses. It is for the Claimant to establish the factual elements necessary to sustain
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the challenged measures.”° The Claimant appears to
agree with this position.?"

237. On the merits, the Claimant must establish the facts showing that the challenged
measures are contrary to the substantive protections of the NAFTA — a position which
the Claimant accepts.” For instance, it is for the Claimant to demonstrate the facts that
constitute a breach of Article 1105(1).?° Similarly, where the Respondent raises a

defense — for instance, that the FIT Program involves procurement under Article
1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b) — it must establish the facts necessary to sustain the
defense.”

B. SUBMISSION OF A CLAIM TO ARBITRATION

. The Claimant has initiated the present arbitration under Chapter 11 of the NAFTA and
alleges breaches of the substantive guarantees contained in that Chapter. It cites
Articles 1116, 1120 and 1122 of the NAFTA as bases for this arbitration.2°

On its part, the Respondent has raised a number of preliminary objections. First, it
contends that this Tribunal is without jurisdiction over the present dispute (or, at least
part of the dispute), as the Claimant has failed to comply with the three-month “cooling
off’ period specified in Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA ((2) below). Second and in the
alternative, it contends that even if the necessary conditions have been fulfilled, the
Claimant has raised numerous arguments which are beyond the scope of the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. Specifically, according to the Respondent, this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
over alleged breaches that occurred before the Claimant made its investments in Ontario
((3) below). Third, the Respondent objects that the acts of the OPA are not attributable
to it ((4) below). Finally, relying on Article 1116, it argues that the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction to consider any alleged breaches which could not have caused loss to the
Claimant (an objection discussed in the context of the first jurisdictional defense in
connection with Article 1120(1) in section (2) below).

Before entering into the merits of the Respondent’s objections, the Tribunal will first
examine the Claimant’s compliance with the requirements for the submission of a claim
to arbitration ((1) below).

24 Exh. CL-204, Chevron Corporation (U.S.A.) and Texaco Petroleum Corporation (U.S.A.) v. Republic
of Ecuador (UNCITRAL), Interim Award, 1 December 2008, §138 (“As a general rule, the holder of a
right raising a claim on the basis of that right in legal proceedings bears the burden of proof for all
elements required for the claim. However, an exception to this rule occurs when a respondent raises a
defense to the effect that the claim is precluded despite the normal conditions being met. In that case,
the respondent must assume the burden of proof for the elements necessary for the exception to be
allowed.”).

1. Requirements for Submission of a Claim to Arbitration

241. Section B of Chapter 11 of the NAFTA contains various requirements for the submission
of a claim to arbitration under the provisions of that Chapter. The Claimant recognises
that (at least some of) these requirements must be fulfilled.° The Tribunal now turns to

review the Claimant's satisfaction of these requirements.

242. As mentioned above, the Claimant has submitted its claims to arbitration under Article

1116. The conditions to submit a claim to arbitration under Article 1116 are provided in

a. Article 1121

Article 1121, which reads as follows:

243. Thus, Article 1121 requires a “disputing investor’?” to consent to arbitration in
accordance with the procedures set out in the NAFTA. Further, the disputing investor
must waive its right to initiate or continue other proceedings concerning the measures

“Article 1121: Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration

1. A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1116 to arbitration
only if:

(a) the investor consents to arbitration in accordance with the procedures
set out in this Agreement; and

(b) the investor and, where the claim is for loss or damage to an interest
in an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor
owns or controls directly or indirectly, the enterprise, waive their right to
initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the
law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings
with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a
breach referred to in Article 1116, except for proceedings for injunctive,
declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of
damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the
disputing Party.”

that are the subject of the Chapter 11 arbitration.

28 Mem. §§838-855.

27 Article 1139 of the NAFTA defines “disputing investor” as “an investor that makes a claim under

Section B.”

42

244. Mesa has consented to arbitrate in accordance with the procedures of the NAFTA and
it has submitted the necessary waiver.” It has therefore complied with the requirements
of Article 1121, which the Respondent does not appear to contest.

b. Article 1116

245. Article 1116 sets out the circumstances under which an investor may bring a claim
against a NAFTA Party in the following terms:
“Article 1116: Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf

1. An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a
claim that another Party has breached an obligation under:

(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or

(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the
monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party's obligations
under Section A,

and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising
out of, that breach.

[..J"

246. Consequently, under Article 1116, this Tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to claims of an
“investor” of one NAFTA Party ((i) below) that another NAFTA Party has breached
Section A (i.e. Articles 1101-1114) of Chapter 11 of the NAFTA ((ii) below).

(i) Is the Claimant an “investor”?

247. The term “investor” is defined in Article 1139 as an enterprise that makes an investment:

“Article 1139: Definitions
For purposes of this Chapter:
investor of a Party means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national

or an enterprise of such Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made
an investment

28 NoA §3; Exhs. C-001, C-002.

28 The Tribunal would also have jurisdiction to decide claims concerning breaches of Article 1503,
which is not relevant here.

43

248.

249.

250.

251.

[.J"
“Enterprise of a Party” is in turn defined as follows:

“enterprise of a Party means an enterprise constituted or organized under
the law of a Party, and a branch located in the territory of a Party and
carrying out business activities there.”°°

“Investment” is defined broadly to include many different types of investments including
(in a somewhat circular manner) an enterprise, equity, debt, real estate or other property
whether tangible or intangible.

As mentioned above (§1), Mesa is a U.S. corporation. Through a chain of companies
registered in the U.S. and in Alberta, Canada, Mesa owns TTD, Arran, North Bruce and
Summerhill, which are all unlimited liability companies incorporated in Canada (§2). In
addition, Mesa holds other interests and assets related to its renewable energy business
in Canada.*"

In other words, Mesa is an investor under Article 1139(a). It is an enterprise of a NAFTA
Party which has made an investment in the form of four “enterprises” and other property
in another NAFTA Party. While Canada does not challenge the Claimant's status as an
investor, it objects to jurisdiction in respect of alleged breaches that are said to have
occurred before Mesa made its investment in Canada, an objection to which the Tribunal

will return in the continuation of its analysis (§§319 et. seq.).

(ii) Are the claims within the ambit of Section A of Chapter 11?

252. The second requirement for a submission to arbitration under Article 1116 is that the

claims arise out of Section A of Chapter 11, i.e. Articles 1101 to 1114. In this respect,
the Tribunal refers to Article 1101, which addresses the “scope and coverage” of Chapter
11. Article 1101(1) establishes both the scope and coverage of the substantive
protections accorded to investors and investments (Section A of Chapter 11) as well as

30 Article 1139 of the NAFTA.

31 Mem. §33 (“In addition to the interests in the [wind projects], Mesa's interests include: (a) Real estate
and other property, both tangible and intangible, including interests in lands and leases in Ontario on
which wind turbines were to be built; and (b) Tangible and intangible property ‘acquired in the
expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes’ and (c) ‘Interests
arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity
in such territory’, including rights to receive a FIT contract from the Ontario Power Authority (OPA)
based upon their priority ranking.”).

44

the scope of the rights to submit disputes to arbitration under Chapter Eleven (Section
B of Chapter 11) as follows:
“Article 1101: Scope and Coverage

1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party
relating to:

(a) investors of another Party;

(b) investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party;
and

(c) with respect to Articles 1106 and 1114, all investments in the territory
of the Party.
LT

253. Thus, in order for the claims to fall within the scope of Section A of Chapter 11, they
must target “measures adopted or maintained by a Party” ((a) below) affecting investors
or the investments of investors of another Party ((b) below).

(a) “Measures”

254. The Claimant contends that the following measures of the Government and of the OPA,
either jointly or taken together breached Articles 1102, 1103, 1105 and 1106:

« Measures of the Government of Ontario:
>  Inrespect of the FIT Program:

i. The Electricity Act, 1998 as amended, in particular, Parts Il.1 (Ontario
Power Authority) and II.2 (Management of Electricity Supply, Capacity
and Demand), including Section 25.35 (Feed-in tariff Program);

ii. | The GEGEA and the GEA;

iii. The Ministerial direction of 24 September 2009, directing the OPA to
establish the FIT Program and setting out the domestic content

requirements to be included in the FIT Program;

iv. The LTEP of 23 November 2010;

45

v. The ranking of the FIT Program applicants on 21 December 2010;

vi. The Ministerial direction of 17 February 2011, which directed the OPA
to plan for 10,700 MW of renewable energy generating capacity,
excluding hydroelectric, by 2018;

vii. The Ministerial direction of 3 June 2011, which directed the OPA to
offer FIT Contracts for up to 750 MW in the Bruce Region and to set

up the Connection Point Amendment Window;

In respect of the GEIA:

Vv

The conclusion of the MOU between the Ontario Ministry of Energy
and the Korean Consortium on 12 December 2008;

ii. |The alleged conclusion of a Framework Agreement between the
Government of Ontario and the Korean Consortium on 25 September
2009 (signed on 29 October 2009);

ii. | The Ministerial direction of 30 September 2009, which directed the
OPA to set aside transmission capacity for the Korean Consortium;

iv. | The conclusion of the GEIA on 21 January 2010; and

v. The direction of 17 September 2010, which directed the OPA to hold
in reserve 500 MW of transmission capacity in the Bruce Region;

« Measures of the OPA:
i. All versions of the FIT Rules in particular Rule 6.4(a)(i) of Version 1.1,
which required projects that became operational after 1 January 2012
to achieve 50% domestic content;

ii. | The FIT Contract. In particular, Section 2.4(b)(iii) and Annex D;

iii. | The alleged failure to follow the FIT Rules with respect to the ranking
and evaluation of applications;

46

vi.

vii.

viii.

The decision taken in August 2010 not to run the ECT;

The allegedly better treatment offered by the OPA to other FIT
applicants, and the OPA’s meetings with other FIT applicants which
led to benefits not available to the Claimants being granted to these
applicants; °?

The release of the FIT Program rankings on 21 December 2010;

The OPA’s alleged misadministration of the FIT Program;

The OPA’s decision on the information to be included in the TAT
tables;

The OPA’s decision to offer NextEra a FIT Contract with connection
points on the 500 kV Bruce to Longwood Line; and

The award of the FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011.

255. The Tribunal recalls that Article 201 of the NAFTA provides that the term “measure
includes any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice.”

256. The Respondent has not disputed — and rightly so — that the acts identified by the

Claimant qualify as “measures” under the definition of Article 201 of the NAFTA. As other

tribunals have observed,** the term “measures” in Article 201 must be understood

broadly. While not all governmental acts necessarily constitute “measures”, the

Tribunal is satisfied that the acts listed above fall within the ambit of Article 201.

257. The Tribunal notes that, in its Memorial, the Claimant listed some acts of Hydro One and

IESO, which it claims to be attributable to the Government of Ontario and, therefore, to

Canada. The Claimant noted in particular that IESO was part of the “Korean Consortium

82 Reply §878(b)(iv).

33 See, for instance, Exh. RL-010, Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of
America (\CSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3), Decision on Hearing of Respondent's Objection to
Competence and Jurisdiction, 5 January 2001, §53.

% Exh. CL-104, Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, & Ellen Baca v. The United Mexican States (ICSID
Case No. ARB (AF)/97/2), Award, 1 November 1999 (“Azinian"), §87.

262.

Working Group” and that, in 2010 and 2011, IESO and Hydro One met with the
Claimant’s competitors to discuss a connection to a 500 kV transmission line.*° For the
reasons set forth below (§376), the Tribunal has not listed them among the measures
referred to above.

For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal further notes that not all of the measures identified
in (§254) above are relevant for the Tribunal’s analysis of the merits of the dispute.
Indeed, for reasons that it will express later, it considers that it lacks jurisdiction over the
measures that were already in existence at the time when Mesa invested in Canada.

(b) Measures “relating to” investors or the investments of investors

As mentioned above, to fall within the ambit of Section A of Chapter 11, the impugned
measures must “relate to” an investor of another NAFTA Party or to investments of such
an investor. In the context of the present dispute, this means that all of the measures
identified in (§254) above must have a causal nexus with the Claimant or its
investment.°° Having reviewed each of the measures identified in §254 above, the
Tribunal considers that all of them have a causal link with the Claimant and its

investments, a position which the Respondent does not appear to dispute.

Thus, the acts identified by the Respondent are “measures” under Article 1101(1) of the
NAFTA. Further, they relate to the Claimant and its investments. Thus, the requirements
of Article 1101(1) of the NAFTA are met.

In conclusion, the Tribunal holds that the Claimant is an investor and that its claims fall
within the scope of Section A of Chapter 11. As a result, the Tribunal holds that the
requirements of Article 1116(1) have been met.

c. Article 1118

Another condition to submit a claim to arbitration is set out in Article 1118, which provides
that the Parties must attempt to settle their dispute amicably:

35 Mem. §§234, 578, 633, 671.

36 Exh. RL-045, Cargill Incorporated v. United Mexican States (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2), Award,
18 September 2009 (“Cargill’), §174 (“Article 1101 has a causal connection requirement as well: the
measures adopted or maintained by Respondent must be those ‘relating to’ investors of another Party
or investments of investors of another Party.”).

48

“Article 1118: Settlement of a Claim through Consultation and Negotiation

The disputing parties should first attempt to settle a claim through
consultation or negotiation.”

263. The Respondent initially argued that the Parties had not entered into consultations under

Article 1118. It contended that, although it had offered to hold consultations with the
Claimant through its letters of 13 July, 21 September, 30 September, 28 October, and
30 December 2011, “[t]he Claimant accepted none of these offers and no consultations
have occurred.”3”

264. In reality, the record shows that the Claimant had sought consultations on 6 July 2011,

prior to the Respondent's purported invitation of 13 July 2011.%° This fact is also
evidenced by two documents to which the Claimant referred in rebutting Canada’s
allegations.°° Mesa also supplied its responses to the Respondent's invitations‘? and
noted that there has been “a series of privileged exchanges of correspondence under
the terms of NAFTA Article 1118”, but that no consultations materialized because of “a
disagreement between the Investor and Canada over the lack of confirmation that
Canada’s delegation would include those persons responsible for the measures in
dispute from the Government of Ontario to ensure that consultations between the parties
were meaningful.”4*

265. In the Tribunal’s opinion, these facts are sufficient to meet the condition of Article 1118.

In any event, the Tribunal notes that after the Claimant’s additional submissions, the
Respondent appears to have dropped this argument.

d. Article 1119

266. Article 1119 provides that 90 days before submission of a claim to arbitration, an investor

a7

38

39

40

“1

must send a Notice of Intent to the disputing Party:

“Article 1119: Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration

Canada's Objection to Jurisdiction dated 3 December 2012 (“Objection to Jurisdiction”) §16.
Exhs. C-005, 099, 100.

Mem. §819.

Exhs. C-103, 104, 114.

Answer on Jurisdiction §33.

49

The disputing investor shall deliver to the disputing Party written notice of
its intention to submit a claim to arbitration at least 90 days before the
claim is submitted

[-.-]

267. It is not disputed that the Claimant delivered its Notice of Intent on 6 July 2011, and filed
its Notice of Arbitration 90 days later on 4 October 2011. This requirement is, therefore,
satisfied.

268. The Tribunal is aware of the Respondent's objection to the Claimant's inclusion into its
Notice of Arbitration of events occurring after its Notice of Intent.‘? This objection is
addressed in the context of the Respondent's Article 1120 objection below.

2. Article 1120 Objection

269. As mentioned above, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's failure to comply with
the requirements of Article 1120 deprives this Tribunal of jurisdiction over the present
dispute or a part of it. The Tribunal first reproduces the Parties’ positions ((a) and (b)
below) and the Non-Disputing Parties’ submissions ((c) below) and then discusses its
reasons ((d) below).

a. The Respondent’s Position

270. The Respondent submits that the NAFTA Parties have conditioned their consent to
arbitration on a potential claimant following the procedures set out in Articles 1118 to
1121 of the NAFTA. In this case, the Claimant filed its Notice of Arbitration on 4 October
2011, only three months after it was not awarded a FIT Contract, which is the event that
precipitated its claim. By doing so, it disregarded Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA that
required it to wait six months after the events in question to submit a claim to arbitration.
Since the Claimant did not comply with Article 1120(1), Canada has not consented to
arbitrate the claims before this Tribunal. As a result, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.

27

. The Respondent opposes the Claimant’s argument that Article 1120(1) does not require
that all the events giving rise to a claim occurred six months before the notice of
arbitration. It submits that the ordinary meaning of the phrase “events giving rise to a
claim” in Article 1120(1) designates each and every event which led to the claim. If the

42 Objection to Jurisdiction §40.

50

272.

273.

274.

intent had been to refer only to some of the events or to the first event in the chain, the
singular term “event” or language such as “any of the events” would have been used.

According to the Respondent, the Claimant's interpretation of Article 1120(1) of the
NAFTA destroys the very purpose of that provision. Article 1120(1) provides a
respondent with six months to acquire knowledge of the facts of a possible claim. This
time period is especially important when the source of the claim is a measure taken by
a sub-national government. Further, Article 1120 is entitled “Submission of a Claim to
Arbitration.” The words “a claim” do not refer to any claim, but to the claim that is being
submitted to arbitration. If the claims cover multiple breaches or numerous events, then
Article 1120(1) requires that six months have passed since all of the events giving rise
to any aspect of the claim have occurred.

The Respondent further argues that Articles 1118-1120 must be read and interpreted
together. The consultation provisions of Article 1118 and the notice of potential claims in
Article 1119 are embodied in the purpose of Article 1120. There is nothing inconsistent
about these provisions being understood as notice provisions. Articles 1119 and 1120
combined, pursue the same objective as Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty Between the
United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning The Encouragement
and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (“US-Ecuador BIT”). Therefore, the Claimant's
efforts to distinguish Burlington and Murphy (both of which considered this BIT) are ill-
placed. The fact that notice and consultation requirements are included in a single
provision in the US-Ecuador BIT (because the periods are the same) rather than in
separate provisions like in the NAFTA (because the periods are different) is irrelevant.

The Respondent also contends that the Claimant is wrong to argue that the phrase
“events giving rise to a claim” in Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA can include knowledge of
future events. It notes that Article 1120(1) requires time to have “elapsed” in the past
tense. Moreover, the Claimant's reliance on Ethy/ is misguided. In that case, the tribunal
took a “future event” into account because its occurrence was a certainty. By contrast,
here the earlier events, i.e. the rankings and the treatment of the Korean Consortium,
did not entail that the June 3 Direction would be issued or the FIT Contracts awarded as
they were on 4 July 2011. For the Respondent, “[t]he earlier events may be relevant to
what happened later in time, but they are not the sort of events that could lead one to

51

275.

276.

277.

278.

say that the Claimant knew at that point that the future events which actually gave rise
to its claims were going to occur.”

The Claimant is also wrong, so says the Respondent, in its argument that the 3 June
2011 Direction and the award of the FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011 “are part of a
composite act which commenced long before” those dates, with the result that the
requirements of Article 1120(1) would be met. The Respondent points to the
Commentary on Article 15 of the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally
Wrongful Acts of the International Law Commission (“ILC Articles”), pursuant to which
what is relevant is the time when the alleged wrongful act occurred. In the case of a
composite act, a “claim” only arises when “sufficient” events taken together have
occurred to constitute the allegedly wrongful act. It is only when six months have elapsed
since this date that a claim can be submitted to arbitration. By filing its claim merely three
months after the disputed award of the FIT Contracts, the Claimant failed to fulfil the
requirements of Article 1120(1), even if the measures complained of were considered
as a composite act.

In any event, even if the Claimant's interpretation of Article 1120(1) were correct, no
claim exists under NAFTA Article 1116(1) until a challenged measure allegedly causes
harm. The events before 4 July 2011 were not susceptible of causing harm and thus
could not “give rise to a claim.” Indeed, no claim could have arisen before 4 July 2011,
when the Claimant was refused a FIT Contract. As a consequence, even under its own
interpretation, the Claimant should have waited for six months after 4 July 2011 to submit
its claim to arbitration.

Finally, the Respondent contends that it is irrelevant whether attempts to resolve the
dispute would have been successful or not. It adds that Mesa has in any event not shown
that negotiations would have been futile. It is equally irrelevant for Canada that six
months have elapsed since the filing of the Notice of Arbitration. The contrary “would
render waiting period clauses such as Article 1120 superfluous and without
consequence.”

On this basis, and in reliance on Burlington, Murphy and other authorities, the
Respondent requests the Tribunal to dismiss the claim in its entirety. At the very least,

43 C-Mem. §251.
44 Objection to Jurisdiction §35.

52

279.

280.

28

282.

the Respondent contends that the Tribunal should dismiss the claims arising from events
which occurred within the six-month period preceding the Notice of Arbitration. Since the
latter was filed on 4 October 2011, this means that the Tribunal should dismiss claims
arising out of events which occurred after 4 April 2011.

b. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that Canada has “clearly” consented to this arbitration. It contends
that there are no irregularities in the submission of its claim to arbitration and that, even
if there were any, it would not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction. Indeed, relying on
authorities such as Ethyl, Lauder and Biwater, the Claimant argues that objections based
on Article 1120(1) are procedural and not jurisdictional in nature.

The Claimant also refutes Canada’s argument that Article 1120(1) requires an investor
to wait six months after all of its possible claims have materialized, rather than waiting
for six months after “a claim” has arisen. For the Claimant, Canada’s interpretation is
contrary to Article 102 of the NAFTA and Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. It would
be “absurd” to require an investor to wait six months from every subsequent breach to
bring a claim in respect of a prior breach. If that were the case, continuous and on-going
breaches would in effect bar a tribunal from ever deciding a claim. As long as a NAFTA
Party kept committing wrongful acts, the investor would be unable to launch a claim.

. The Claimant also disputes that Articles 1118 and 1119 are duplicated by implication

into Article 1120, which would “serve no practical, logical or conceptual purpose.”4° It
finds Canada’s proposition directly contrary to the plain text of the NAFTA and to the
deliberate drafting of Articles 1118, 1119 and 1120 as distinct requirements, each
providing separately for consultation (Article 1118), notice of dispute (Article 1119) and
a cooling-off period (Article 1120). Article 1120(1) does not impose an additional notice
requirement as Canada contends. Only Article 1119 requires “written notice of [an
Investor's] intention to submit a claim to arbitration.”

Mesa disagrees with Canada’s reliance on Burlington and Murphy because of the
differences in the notice provisions of the US-Ecuador BIT and the NAFTA. Instead of
one notice provision, into which time for consultation was implied, the NAFTA contains
three separate and distinct requirements in Articles 1118, 1119 and 1120. The essential

purpose of Article VI (3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT is reflected in Article 1119, which
provides for the state to be informed of a dispute, so it can collect information and engage
in consultations as provided in Article 1118. In other words, the NAFTA Parties rejected
the single provision approach in favor of three separate requirements contained in
Articles 1118, 1119, 1120 which cannot be ignored.

The Claimant also argues that the 3 June Direction and the 4 July award of FIT Contracts
“are part of a composite act which commenced long before.” The ILC Articles consider
that it is the earliest date in a series of events which gives rise to a composite breach.
As both events in question are related to earlier events (the domestic content
requirements in the FIT Program; the failure to follow the FIT Rules with respect to the
ranking and evaluation of the Claimant's applications; the preferential treatment given to
the Korean Consortium and other FIT applicants), the requirement of Article 1120(1) is
met.

In rebuttal of the argument that, for a composite act, “sufficient” events must exist to
satisfy Article 1120(1), the Claimant submits that a tribunal should look to the investor's
good faith understanding of its claim to determine at what point in time “sufficient” events
do exist. It must consider the wrongful conduct which is the basis of the claim and “ask,
based upon the investor's theory of law, are there ‘sufficient’ acts and omissions six
months prior to filing the Notice that, if proven, would establish internationally wrongful
conduct of a sort that would allow the investor to succeed with the claim as filed?” If the
investor came to the conclusion in good faith that it had a claim at a particular point in
time and waited six months from that time, the waiting period should not bar the claims.

In respect of Canada’s argument that Article 1116(1) requires a showing of harm, the
Claimant responds that Article 1120(1) speaks of “events” that give rise to a claim,
nothing more. In particular, Article 1120(1) does not require an investor to demonstrate
that each “event” caused harm. For the Claimant, “[aJn event is not the same as a
‘breach’; rather an event, or series of events, can give rise to a breach, which in turn give
rise to a claim [...] ‘Events giving rise to a claim’ cannot mean an investor needs to
demonstrate each and every event caused loss or damage.”“°

To counter the Respondent’s submission that a notice under Article 1120(1) is required
for the state to consult with its regional entities, the Claimant notes that a meaningful

46 Reply §840.

29

consultation would in any event not have been possible. There was no indication that
the Federal Government was prepared to offer monetary compensation and it was
reasonable to assume that any consultation without the engagement of the Government

of Ontario would have been futile.

Furthermore, the Claimant also argues that Canada has failed to establish any unfair
surprise or bad faith on the Claimant's part. It has not shown that the lack of a six month
cooling-off period with respect to some events compromised the possibility of settlement
or turned out to be detrimental to Canada in these proceedings.

Finally, Mesa submits that “[p]ractical and efficient approaches should be preferred by
NAFTA Tribunals to best serve the NAFTA’s objectives to enhance the resolution of
disputes in the NAFTA region”, and that Canada’s interpretation of Article 1120(1) “is
entirely contrary to the effective settlement of disputes.” If Canada’s interpretation is
adopted, later events could only be addressed by filing a new claim and constituting a
new tribunal, which would be costly and wasteful as two different tribunals would
consider events which occurred at different times, but are part of the same composite or

continuing breach.
c. The Non-Disputing Parties’ Position

Mexico submits that the NAFTA Parties consented to arbitration upon compliance with
the procedural requirements stipulated in Articles 1116-1121 of the NAFTA. Thus,
tribunals must ensure that a claimant complies with all of the requirements set out in

these provisions.

It further insists that Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA requires six months to have elapsed
from the time when the allegedly wrongful act occurred. The claim must be ripe at the
time it is filed. The waiting period provided in Article 1120(1) plays an important role in
the overall operation of Chapter 11, “which is to provide a respondent Party with six
months to learn of the events that may give rise to a claim, to meet with any potential
claimants and to attempt to remedy the problem if appropriate.” If a claim is submitted
before the end of the six-month waiting period, a tribunal would lack jurisdiction even if
such period elapsed by the time the tribunal was constituted.

. The U.S. equally submits that no claim can be brought to arbitration unless the

requirements of Chapter 11 are met. For the U.S.., “[tlogether with the notice requirement

55

292.

29:

295.

296.

eo

in Article 1119, the ‘cooling-off requirement in Article 1120(1) affords a NAFTA Party
time to identify and assess potential disputes, coordinate among relevant national and
sub-national officials, and consider amicable settlement or other courses of action prior
to arbitration.” Consequently, any claim for which a claimant has not waited six months
from the relevant events is not submitted in accordance with Article 1120(1). Hence, the
submission does not satisfy the requirements of consent contained in Articles 1121 and
1122 of the NAFTA.

The U.S. further submits that there can be no claim under Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA
until an investor has suffered harm from an alleged breach. Read together, Articles
1116(1) and 1120(1) of the NAFTA provide that a disputing investor may submit a claim
to arbitration under Chapter 11 “only for a breach that already has occurred and for which
damage or loss has already been incurred, provided that six months has elapsed from
the events giving rise to the claim. No claim based solely on speculation as to future
breaches or future loss may be submitted.”

d. Analysis

Article 1120(1) provides for a six-month waiting period before the submission of a claim
to arbitration. It reads as follows:

“Article 1120: Submission of a Claim to Arbitration

1. Except as provided in Annex 1120.1, and provided that six months have

elapsed since the events giving rise to a claim, a disputing investor may
submit the claim to arbitration [...]’

As set out above, the Respondent contends that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction
because the Claimant has failed to comply with this six-month waiting period.
Alternatively, it submits that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over claims arising
out of the two events that occurred within the six-month period preceding the Notice of
Arbitration. The Claimant opposes these submissions on numerous grounds.

To resolve the issue, the Tribunal must interpret Article 1120(1). It will do so in application
of the principles of interpretation identified above (§§231 et. seq.) and bearing in mind
the objectives stated in Article 102(1) of the NAFTA.

At the outset, it bears recalling the reason why States provide for cooling off or waiting

periods in investment treaties. The object and purpose of these periods is to appraise
the State of a possible dispute and to provide it with an opportunity to remedy the

56

situation before the investor initiates an arbitration.‘” In most bilateral investment
treaties, notice and consultation period requirements are included in a single provision. *®
By contrast, the NAFTA deals with this matter in three distinct provisions. Article 1118 of
the NAFTA provides that disputing parties should attempt to settle a claim through
consultation or negotiation. Article 1119 requires a disputing Party to send a written
notice of its intent to submit a claim to arbitration at least 90 days before the submission.
The notice must specify the provisions of the Agreement alleged to have been breached
as well as the issues and the factual basis for the claim. A different provision — Article
1120 — addresses the submission of a claim to arbitration and specifies that six months
must have elapsed since the events giving rise to a claim.

297. Typically, consultations between the disputing parties take place after a notice of intent
has been submitted.*° Thus, through the notice of intent — in which an investor must
articulate its claims with a reasonable degree of specificity — a disputing NAFTA Party is
informed of the claims against it. It then has at least 90 days to consider and possibly
settle the claims. The six-month period in Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA provides an
additional opportunity to resolve the dispute amicably. The six-month period is an
additional requirement. While it may partially overlap with the 90 days of Article 1119, it
is a distinct condition deriving from a separate provision.

298. Having thus explained the object and purpose of Article 1120(1) in the context of the
other provisions of the NAFTA, the Tribunal will now turn to the Parties’ arguments. They
diverge in particular on the significance of the words “events giving rise to a claim” in

47 Exh. RL-002, Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador (\CSID Case No. ARB/08/5),
Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010, §312. See also Western NIS Enterprise Fund v. Ukraine (ICSID
Case No. ARB/04/2), Order, 16 March 2006, §5 (“[the six-month waiting period requirement] allows the
State, acting through its competent organs, to examine and possibly resolve the dispute by
negotiations.”).

48 For instance, Article VI of the US-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (on which the Respondent
has relied in its submissions) provides: “(2) In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the
dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation [...] (3)(a) Provided that
the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2(a)
or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or
company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement
by binding arbitration.”

49 Exh. CL-6, Re Notices of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration (2003) (FTC) (“Efforts to settle
NAFTA investment claims through consultation or negotiation have generally taken place only after the
delivery of the notice of intent. The notice of intent naturally serves as the basis for consultation or
negotiations between the disputing investor and the competent authorities of a Party”). See also Meg
Kinnear et. al. (eds.), Investment Disputes under NAFTA (2006, Kluwer Law International) 1119-13.
The Parties agree (Mem. §844-845, C-Mem. §244).

50 Exh. RL-031, Canadian Statement of Implementation, p. 154.

Article 1120(1). According to the Respondent, the ordinary meaning of this phrase entails
that every event which gives rise to a claim must have occurred at least six months prior
to the submission of that claim to arbitration.5' By contrast, the Claimant contends that
the requirement of Article 1120(1) is satisfied, provided some of the events giving rise to
the claim have occurred more than six months before the start of the arbitration.

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant on this issue. If the Respondent’s argument were
followed, every new event related to a claim would require a claimant to wait for a new
six months period before starting arbitration. This would apply however secondary or
ancillary the new event may be. If events relating to the same claim kept occurring, a
claimant would effectively be precluded from ever initiating an arbitration. This
interpretation would effectively deprive Article 1116(1) (that entitles investors to submit
a claim to arbitration) of effet utile, an outcome that is contrary to treaty interpretation
rules.

Moreover, Article 102(1)(e) of the NAFTA, which this Tribunal must take into
consideration when interpreting Article 1120(1), sets out the object and purpose of the
Agreement as “creat[ing] effective procedures [...] for the resolution of disputes.” It could
hardly be said that this objective is satisfied by an interpretation of Article 1120(1)
requiring the Claimant to initiate a new arbitration in respect of two out of a series of
events that give rise to the claims before this Tribunal. This would clearly be
counterproductive in terms of effective dispute settlement and would trigger the usual
drawbacks of multiple proceedings, including a waste of resources and risks of
conflicting decisions.*? This is particularly true here where sufficient events giving rise to
the claim had already occurred before the six-month cooling-off period — and all the more
so considering that the Respondent was fully notified of the claims in accordance with
Article 1119 of the NAFTA. Indeed, in its Notice of Intent of 6 July 2011, the Claimant
had identified the 3 June Direction and the refusal to award the FIT Contracts of 4 July
as events giving rise to its claim. By the time the Notice of Arbitration was filed on 4

51 C-Mem. §240 (“Article 1120 requires that six months have passed since all of the events giving rise
to any aspect of the claim have occurred before submitting it to arbitration.”).

2 Other tribunals have adopted a similar approach. See for instance, Exh. CL-2, Ethyl Corporation v.
The Government of Canada (UNCITRAL), Award on Jurisdiction, 24 June 1998, §85; and Exh. CL-3,
Pope & Talbot Inc. v. The Government of Canada (UNCITRAL), Award Concerning the Motion by
Government of Canada Respecting the Claim based upon Imposition of the “Super Fee”, 7 August
2000, §27.

53 Notice of Intent §34 (“The Measures at issue raised in this dispute include, but are not limited to [...]:
FIT direction dated June 3,2011"); §19 (“On July 4,2011 the Wind Farm Investments consequently lost

58

October 2011, the Respondent was well aware of all the events giving rise to the
Claimant's claim. It was not somehow taken by surprise by the claims mentioned in the
Notice of Arbitration.

301.

For these reasons, the Tribunal considers that the six-month requirement in Article
1120(1) must be deemed met if sufficient events giving rise to a claim exist six months
prior to the submission of the dispute to arbitration. If additional events occur within the
six-month period which are part of the claim brought to arbitration, they can be regarded
as not affecting the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over that claim. This is all the more the case
where the additional events are foreseeable, as was the case in Ethy/.°° The Respondent
appears to agree with this position, albeit in a different context.°°

302. Having reached this understanding, the Tribunal must now review what the “claim” is
and whether sufficient events giving rise to the claim existed prior to the six-month
period.*” On the facts of this case, the latter review essentially involves determining
whether the 3 June Direction and 4 July award of FIT Contracts are part of the same
subject-matter as the prior events.°°

their priority ranking and were not offered FIT Program contracts, because of the 750 MW limit on
awards in the Bruce Region [...]”).

54 Two events were listed in the Notice of Arbitration although were not in the Notice of Intent because
they occurred after the filing of the Notice of Intent: (i) that the Government of Ontario withdrew its ability
to terminate FIT Contracts for cause; (ii) that the Government of Ontario extended the duration of the
special preferences given to the Korean Consortium by a year (Submission on Jurisdiction, §18). The
Claimant submits that “[nJeither of these two events constituted a specific new breach of the NAFTA,
but each fact was relevant to the evaluation of the breaches by the Tribunal” (Submission on
Jurisdiction, §18). In the circumstances, these events are irrelevant to the present analysis. The
Tribunal has considered them in the context of its analysis of the Claimant's Article 1105 claim below.

55 In Ethyl, the event falling within the cooling-off period was legislation that had not come into effect
at the time the arbitration was initiated. See CL-2, §§87-88.

56 C-Mem. §255 (“[FJor the purposes of Article 1120, what is relevant is the time that the alleged
wrongful act resulting in damage to the Claimant occurred, and by consequence a claim, arose. In the
case of a composite act, a ‘claim’ arises only when, taken together, there are enough acts or omissions
sufficient to constitute the allegedly wrongful act. It is only once six months have elapsed from this date
that a claim can be validly submitted to arbitration under Article 1120 of the NAFTA.”).

87 This was the approach of the tribunal in Pope & Talbot albeit in a different context. There, the
Tribunal first determined what the precise claim was in that proceeding, before proceeding to determine
whether a later occurring fact could be included within that claim (Exh. CL-3).

58 See generally Exh. CL-321, CMS v. Argentina (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision of the Tribunal
on Objections to Jurisdiction, 17 July 2003, §109 (The tribunal noted that “as long as [multiple different
actions] [allegedly] affect the investor in violation of its rights and cover the same subject matter, the
fact that they may originate from different sources or emerge at different times does not necessarily
mean that the disputes are separate and distinct.”); Exh. CL-282, Teinver S.A., Transportes de
Cercanias S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. The Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No.
ARB/09/1), Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 December 2012, §123 (‘[i]nternational jurisprudence suggests
that the subject matter of the negotiations should be the same as the dispute that is brought before the
court or tribunal.”).

In its Notice of Intent the Claimant described its claim as being about:

“[...] unfairness, the abuse of power and process and undue political
interference in the regulation of renewable energy in Ontario through the
unannounced last-minute imposition of arbitrary measures and through
opaque and secret administration and ‘buy local’ contract requirements.
The government changed the regulatory framework without notice and
without due process, so as directly to curtail and impair market access
rights under the established scheme for renewable energy in Ontario.”

It then identified most of the numerous measures listed above (§254) as the “Measures

at issue raised in this dispute.”®°

In its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant then stated as follows:

“THE GENERAL NATURE OF THE CLAIM

6. This claim arises out of the arbitrary and unfair application of various
government measures related to the regulation and production of
renewable energy in Ontario. Canada, through its sub-national organs
imposed sudden and discriminatory changes to the established scheme
for renewable energy, namely the Feed-In-Tariff Program (the “FIT

Program’).

In this context as well, it referred to most of the same measures enumerated above

(§254) as the measures in dispute.

Thus, the claim submitted to this Tribunal principally involves the acts of the Government
and the OPA in relation to the FIT Program and the GEIA. These acts allegedly breach
various provisions of the NAFTA: Article 1102 (national treatment); Article 1103 (most-
favored-nation treatment), Article 1105 (minimum standard of treatment); and Article
1106 (performance requirements). It is clear from the Notice of Intent and the Notice of
Arbitration that the Tribunal was called to consider not only the acts of the governmental

authorities, but also the effects of those acts on the Claimant.

The claim having being identified, the Tribunal must now examine whether sufficient
events giving rise to such claim existed prior to the six-month period of Article 1120(1)
of the NAFTA.

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent has breached Articles 1102, 1103, 1105 and
Article 1106. It is not disputed that the events giving rise to the Article 1106 claim arose
before 4 April 2011 i.e. before the six-month cooling-off period. The events giving rise to

59 Notice of Intent §34.

60

310.

the claims under Articles 1102, 1103, and 1105 also appear to have occurred before the
commencement of the cooling-off period. Indeed, by 4 April 2011, most of the events
listed above (§254) had already occurred: the OPA had (allegedly incorrectly) ranked
the Claimant's FIT projects (on 21 December 2010); available transmission capacity had
been reduced (because of reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium from 12
December 2008, and because of the LTEP of 23 November 2010); and capacity had
been reserved for the Korean Consortium (through the GEIA of 21 January 2010 and its
predecessor agreements), particularly in the Bruce Region (on 17 September 2010).
These events were sufficient to give rise to the claims based on Articles 1102, 1103, and
1105.

These observations are corroborated by the fact that the two events within the six-month
period, the 3 June Direction and 4 July award of FIT Contracts, were merely
developments of events that had taken place earlier before the six-month period, i.e.
before 4 April 2011. The impugned events were — to borrow the Claimant’s expression
— “interrelated” with earlier events™:

e The 3 June Direction limited the available transmission capacity in the Bruce
Region to 750 MW. It further established the Connection Point Amendment
Window. Both of these measures largely resulted from earlier events which
had reduced the available transmission capacity. In December 2010, the OPA
estimated that 1200 MW transmission capacity would be available to projects
in the Bruce Region. However, through the LTEP of 23 November 2010 and
the Ministerial direction of 17 February 2011, the Government directed the
OPA to plan for 10,700 MW of renewable energy generating capacity by 2018.
Further, through the GEIA (and its predecessor agreements), the Government
reserved available transmission capacity for the Korean Consortium. It was
because of the limitations on available transmission capacity* that, on 3 June
2011, the Government directed the OPA to award contracts up to 750 MW
and establish the Connection Point Amendment Window.

e The 4 July award of FIT Contracts was equally the result of events that had
taken place prior to 4 April 2011. By that date the OPA had already ranked

313.

the Claimant's projects. By then, the Government had also limited the
transmission capacity to be awarded to renewable energy projects. This
capacity was further limited by the reservation for the Korean Consortium. As
the Respondent's expert testified, had capacity not been reserved for the
Korean Consortium in the Bruce Region, the Claimant would have been
awarded a FIT Contract for its Arran and TTD projects.® These events, which
are all “events giving rise to a claim”, eventually led to the Claimant not being
awarded a FIT Contract on 4 July 2011.

The Respondent next argues that, pursuant to Article 1116, no claim exists until an
investor has allegedly suffered harm arising from a measure allegedly in breach of the
NAFTA.™ According to it, Mesa could not have suffered damage before 4 July 2011,
when it was not awarded a FIT Contract. As this date falls within the six-month period
prescribed by Article 1120(1), the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the present
dispute.

Article 1116(1) stipulates that a party may initiate an arbitration claiming that (i) a NAFTA
Party has breached Section A of Chapter 11 and that (ii) it incurred loss or damage as a
result of that breach. It is undisputed that the first element — a claim for breach of Section
A of Chapter 11 — is complied with. Indeed, in its Notices of Intent and of Arbitration, the
Claimant alleged violations of Articles 1102, 1103, 1104, 1105 and 1106, all of which fall
within Section A of Chapter 11 of the NAFTA.

For the second component — loss or damage caused by the breach — the Respondent
appears to suggest that the Claimant must have actually suffered a loss or damage six
months before the start of the arbitration. However, this is not what Article 1116(1) states.
It merely requires the investor to “claim” that it has incurred harm due to the breach. It is
not for the investor to prove at this early stage that it has actually suffered a loss or
damage. Proof of actual damage is a matter for the merits, as opposed to the jurisdiction
phase of the arbitration.

62 In its letter of 20 May 2011, the Claimant also sought clarifications of the ranking process (Exh. C-
10).

63 Tr. (30 October 2014) 159:4-12 (“Turning to the GEIA counter factual, we then take away the breach,
which is the 500-megawatt allocation of transmission capacity to the Korean Consortium. So you now
have, at that dotted brown bar, a 1,250-megawatt available transmission capacity. And as you can see,
TTD and Arran make the cut and get FIT contracts in that scenario, but Summerhill and North Bruce
did not.”).

64 C-Mem. §§247-248.

62

314.

315.

316.

Neither is there a requirement under Article 1120(1) that an investor wait six months
after incurring loss or damage before submitting its claim to arbitration. As noted above,
Article 1120(1) simply requires that six-months elapse between the “events giving rise
to aclaim”, and the submission of the claim to arbitration. Hence, it is the “events giving
rise” to the claim of loss or damage (under Article 1116(1)) that must occur six months
previously, not the actual incurring of the loss or damage itself.

A similar question arose in Methanex. There, a Canadian investor claimed that its
investment would be adversely affected by a ban on a gasoline additive. At the time of
the submission of the claim, the ban had been proposed, but had not come into effect.
The respondent challenged jurisdiction on the basis that the investor had not suffered
and could not suffer any loss because the ban was not in effect yet. In rejecting this
challenge, the tribunal observed that it was “an indisputable fact that Methanex has
made ‘a claim...that [Methanex] has incurred loss and damage’.” It added that “the plain
meaning of this provision [i.e. Article 1116(1)] does not require, as a jurisdictional matter,
the claimant to prove loss and damage.”

The NAFTA tribunal in Mobil also considered the question whether a breach giving rise
to future and prospective damage fell within the ambit of Article 1116(1). There, the
tribunal was asked to determine, inter alia, whether Canada had imposed impermissible
performance requirements within the meaning of Article 1106(1)(c) on the foreign
investor, subject to the exceptions of Article 1108. The claimants sought compensation
for the incremental expenditures that they would incur as a result of the application of
the performance requirements from the time that they came into force until 2036. Relying
on Article 1116(1), Canada argued that the Tribunal could not award damages for
prospective losses that were incurred after the filing of the claim. The majority of the
tribunal, however, took a broader view accepting that future damages were covered by
Article 1116:

“A breach giving rise to future and prospective damage may, in general
terms, fall within Article 1116. There is nothing in the language of Article
1116 (1) that convinces us that the provision is directed only to damages
that occurred in the past and does not extend, in principle, to damages
that are the result of a breach which began in the past [...] and continues

63

317.

318.

319.

320.

[...] resulting in the incurring of losses which crystallise (i.e. become
quantifiable) and must be paid sometime in the future [...].”°°

. Thus, the Mobil tribunal recognised that its jurisdiction was not limited to losses that had
occurred in the past, but extended to future damages resulting from a breach that had
begun in the past. This is precisely the case here. The limitation of capacity because of
the LTEP and the reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium through the GEIA
of January 2010 and its predecessor agreements — both of which occurred outside the
cooling-off period — resulted in the non-award of FIT Contracts to the Claimant on 4 July
2011. The loss may have accrued on 4 July 2011, but it merely resulted from the earlier
governmental acts. As a result, this Tribunal is not barred from hearing the present
dispute even though damages (if any) were actually incurred by the Claimant within the
six-month waiting period of Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA.

Thus, for the reasons just discussed, the Tribunal denies the Respondent's objections
concerning Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA. It holds that the requirements of Article 1120(1)
have been complied with. As a consequence, it can dispense with determining whether
these requirements go to consent and are thus jurisdictional or whether they are
procedural and could accordingly be satisfied by the passage of time.

3. Ratione temporis Objection

. The Respondent also submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over claims for
breaches that occurred prior to the time when the Claimant invested in Canada. The
Parties’ positions are summarised in (a) and (b) below, and the Tribunal’s analysis is set
out in (d).

a. The Respondent’s Position

Invoking Articles 1101(1) and 1116(1), the Respondent submits that for Chapter 11 to
apply, an investment “of an investor of another party” must already have existed at the
time of the disputed measure. An investor cannot challenge measures that were already
in existence when it made its investment. Put differently, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction

to rule on a challenged measure, unless an investor can establish that it had made its

65 Exh. CL-18, Mobil Investments Inc. & Murphy Oil Corporation v. Government of Canada (ICSID
Case No ARB(AF)/07/4), Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum, 22 May 2012 (“Mobil’),
§427.

64

investment before the measure was adopted. Following this reasoning, as the Claimant's
project companies TTD and Arran were incorporated on 17 November 2009, the Tribunal
has no jurisdiction over the measures which occurred prior to this date with respect to
these projects. Similarly, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over measures affecting North
Bruce and Summerhill which were taken before 6 April 2010, which is the date when the

respective project companies were incorporated.

b. The Claimant’s Position

32

. The Claimant opposes the Respondent’s submissions. Article 1139 defines an “investor
of a Party” as someone “that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment”, a
definition that Mesa meets. It specifies that “[Mesa] made its initial investments in
Canada by August 14, 2009 [...] Mesa actually began looking to invest in Ontario in
March 2009, and began due diligence and transaction work in July 2009.” According to
it “NAFTA’s protection extends to Mesa in August 2009."°”

322. If the Respondent's argument that Mesa’s investments were made only in November
2009 were accepted, the Claimant contends that it would make no difference. The
NAFTA provisions would still apply to the Claimant as of August 2009, because Article
1139 “extends to a situation in which an investor has purchased a good or service in the
country of another state party but has yet to formally incorporate such investment.”

c. The Non-Disputing Parties’ Submissions
323. Neither the U.S. nor Mexico have made any particular submissions on this issue.
d. Analysis

324. Article 1101 circumscribes the scope of application of the treaty, and Article 1116(1)
gives indications about the relevant breaches, in the following terms:
“Article 1101: Scope and Coverage

relating to:

(a) investors of another Party;
(b) investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party.

access to international jurisdiction pursuant to an investment treaty must prove that it was an investor
at the relevant time, i.e., at the moment when the events on which its claim is based occurred”); See
also Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8), Award, 2

over the merits depends on whether Libananco owned GEAS and Kepez shares at the time of the

And:
“Article 1116: Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf

1. An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a
claim that another Party has breached an obligation under:

(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises)
[L-.-]

and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising
out of, that breach.

[.J"

reason that the latter derives from the dispute settlement provisions embodied in Chapter
11. Consequently, there is no jurisdiction if disputed measures are not “relating to
investors” or to “investments of an investor.”® In addition to these express provisions of
Chapter 11, the same conclusion arises as a general matter from the principle of non-
retroactivity of treaties.°° State conduct cannot be governed by rules that are not
applicable when the conduct occurs.

As a consequence, investment arbitration tribunals have repeatedly found that they do
not have jurisdiction ratione temporis unless the claimant can establish that it had an
investment at the time the challenged measure was adopted. In the NAFTA context, the
Tribunal in Vito Gallo observed:

“[Flor Chapter 11 of the NAFTA to apply to a measure relating to an
investment, that investment must be owned or controlled by an investor of
another party, and ownership or control must exist at the time the measure
which allegedly violates the Treaty is adopted or maintained. In a claim
under Art. 1117 the investor must prove that he owned or controlled

committed by the Respondent.”).
8 See Article 28 of the VCLT. See also Article 13 of the ILC Articles.

66

directly or indirectly the ‘juridical person’ holding the investment, at the
critical time.

As the Tribunal in Phoenix declared, it does not need extended
explanation to assert that a tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione temporis to
consider claims arising prior to the date of the alleged investment, because
the treaty cannot be applied to acts committed by a State before the
claimant invested in the host country. In the present case, the Claimant
must have owned or controlled the Enterprise at the time when the AMLA
was enacted. And since the Tribunal has already found that the Claimant
has failed to marshal the evidence necessary to prove such ownership and
control at the relevant time, the necessary consequence is that his claim
must fail for lack of jurisdiction ratione temporis.””°

327. Accordingly, this Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis is limited to measures that
occurred after the Claimant became an “investor” holding an “investment.” These terms
are defined in Article 1139 as follows:

“Investment of an investor of a Party means an investment owned or
controlled directly or indirectly by an investor of such Party;

Investor of a Party means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national
or an enterprise of such Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made
an investment;

LT

328. Under this definition, an investor is not only someone who has made an investment; it is
also someone who “seeks to make” an investment. On this basis, the Claimant contends
that Chapter 11 extended to Mesa before the actual incorporation of its investments in
Canada in November 2009 (for TTD and Arran) and April 2010 (for North Bruce and
Summerhill).”*

329. Before it addresses the merits of this argument, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant’s
allegations as to the precise time at which it sought to make its investments in Canada
lack clarity. For instance, in its submissions prior to the hearing, the Claimant contended
that it sought to make and actually made its investments at the same time (i.e. at the
time of incorporation of its project companies in November 2009 and May 2010), without

distinguishing between the two.’? In the same brief, it also submitted that it was first
affected by the Respondent’s wrongful acts in September 2009 when it was seeking to
make its investments in Ontario.” Still in the same brief, it also referred to June 2009,
when AWA LLC was formed.” By contrast, in its post-hearing submission, the Claimant
contended that Mesa made its initial investment in Canada by 14 August 2009, which is
when the substantive protections of the NAFTA applied to it.”> For the present purposes,
the Tribunal will assume that the Claimant was seeking to make its investment in the
TTD project as of 14 August 2009, and in the Arran project as of 14 September 2009. It
chooses these dates because they appear in the latest submission of the Claimant and,
more importantly, because they are the only dates for which the Claimant has submitted
some evidence.’® No cogent evidence has been submitted by the Claimant for the North
Bruce and Summerhill projects. Therefore, for these projects, the relevant date is
deemed to be the date of incorporation, i.e. 6 April 2010.

330. It is obviously implied in the definition quoted above that there must be a link between
the investor that seeks to make an investment, and the investment that the investor
seeks to make. Put differently, the investor must establish that it was seeking to make

the very investment in respect of which it makes its claims. The Claimant's “investments”
in Canada consist of the four wind farm projects: TTD, Arran, North Bruce, and
Summerhill. Therefore, to establish that it was an investor in August or September 2009,
the Claimant must show that it was seeking to make these four wind farm investment

projects in Canada.

72 Reply §826(a) (“The Investor had been seeking to invest in Canada, and made an investment in
Canada by incorporating its investments TTD Wind Project ULC and Arran Wind Project ULC in the
Province of Alberta on November 17, 2009.”); see also Reply §831 (“[T]here are two dates that are
relevant for events that first give rise to the claim — November 25, 2009 and May 29, 2010.”).

73 Reply §333(f)(i).

intended to achieve several hundred megawatts of wind turbine projects in Canada from the time AWA
LLC was formed with a view to establishing wind projects in June 2009.”).

78 C-PHB §355 (“Mesa made its initial investments in Canada by August 14, 2009. As testified by Cole
Robertson, Mesa actually began looking to invest in Ontario in March 2009, and began due diligence
and transaction work in July 2009. NAFTA’s protection extends to Mesa in August 2009.”).

76 Exh. C-457 and Exh. C-461. By contrast, no evidence was submitted for the other dates supplied by
the Claimant. For instance, in respect of the North Bruce and Summerhill projects, the Claimant
submitted that it was seeking to make an investment before the FIT applications were made for these
projects in May 2010 without providing any evidence in support. It also submitted that “[t]he North Bruce
and Summerhill projects w[e]re simply an expansion of the original Investment” (Reply §859), also
without furnishing any evidence in support.

68

331. In support of its allegation in respect of the TTD Project, the Claimant offers two

documents — a “Certificate of Correction””’ and a “Limited Liability Company Operating
Agreement””, both of AWA TTD Development LLC and both dated 14 August 2009.
According to the Claimant, under the latter Agreement, AWA TTD Development LLC
was authorized to purchase “the assets of [Twenty Two Degree Energy Corp]””®. This is
indeed so. However, AWA TTD Development LLC is a Delaware corporation (§2) and
the Tribunal is unable to establish the link between this asset purchase and the
Claimant’s TTD project which was incorporated in November 2009. The position is the
same for the Arran project. Here too, the Claimant has not established how the evidence
on which it relies shows that Mesa was “seeking to make” its investment in the Arran
project in September 2009.

332. As a result, and in the absence of other evidence, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that

Mesa has failed to establish that it was seeking to make its investments in Canada
starting in August and September 2009. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that the
relevant date for the present analysis is the one on which each of the wind farm vehicles
was incorporated. The Claimant also appears to recognise that the date of incorporation
may be considered as the relevant date for the Tribunal’s analysis.°°

concludes that its jurisdiction is limited to claims based on measures which occurred
after 17 November 2009 for TTD and Arran and after 6 April 2010 for North Bruce and
Summerhill.

334. It follows that, for TTD and Arran, the Tribunal cannot entertain claims based on the
following measures:

a. Measures of the Government in respect of the FIT Program:

i. The Electricity Act, 1998 as amended, in particular, Part II.1 (Ontario
Power Authority) and Part II.2, (Management of Electricity Supply,
Capacity and Demand), including Section 25.35 (Feed-in Tariff
Program);

ii. | The GEGEA and the GEA;

ii. | The Ministerial direction of 24 September 2009 directing the OPA to
establish the FIT Program and setting out the domestic content
requirements to be included in the FIT Program;

b. Measures of the Government in respect of the GEIA:

iv. The conclusion of the MOU between the Ministry of Energy and the
Korean Consortium on 12 December 2008;

v. The alleged conclusion of a Framework Agreement between the
Government and the Korean Consortium on 25 September 2009
(signed on 29 October 2009);

vi. The Ministerial direction of 30 September 2009, which directed the
OPA to set aside transmission capacity for members of the Korean
Consortium;

c. Measures of the OPA:

vii. All version of the FIT Rules, in particular Rule 6.4(a)(i) of Version 1.1

of the FIT Rules, which required projects that became operational after

1 January 2012 to achieve 50% domestic content;

vii. | The FIT Contract, in particular, Section 2.4(b)(iii) and Annex D.

70

335.

336.

. In particular, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims concerning the GEGEA, GEA
and the Ministerial direction of 24 September 2009 in which the Minister of Energy
directed the OPA to include domestic content requirements in the FIT Program (i.e. the
Claimant's Article 1106 claim).®° For completeness, however, the Tribunal notes that
even if it had jurisdiction over this claim, the claim would, in any event, fail on the merits.
As discussed in detail below, the Tribunal has found that the FIT Program constitutes
government procurement. Consequently, Articles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b) apply, and
as a result an Article 1106(1)(b) claim is excluded.

Neither does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to consider the Claimant’s claims that the
MOU of 12 December 2008 or the subsequent alleged Framework Agreement of 25
September 2009 breached Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105 of the NAFTA. However, as
Ontario entered into the GEIA — which was the successor of the MOU and the alleged
Framework Agreement — in January 2010 (i.e. after the Claimant's investment), the
Tribunal does have jurisdiction over the Claimant’s claims in respect of the GEIA. These
claims are considered below (§§542 et. seq.).

337. As for North Bruce and Summerhill, which were incorporated later than the first two

projects, namely on 6 April 2010, the claims in connection with the GEIA of 21 January
2010 are outside the temporal scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, in addition to the

measures excluded in the preceding paragraphs.

338. Having so concluded, it is to be noted that while the measures just listed are beyond the

reach of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the circumstances in which they occurred may be
considered in so far as they provide background and context to the analysis of the claims
over which the Tribunal does have jurisdiction. This is in particular relevant for the
Tribunal’s analysis of the Claimant's Article 1105(1) claims which are considered below
(§§467 et. seq.).

4. Attribution Objection

339. As mentioned above (§254), the Respondent impugns acts of the Government of Ontario

as well as of the OPA, Hydro One and IESO. The Respondent agrees that acts of the

83 The Claimant has identified these measures as being relevant for its Article 1106(1) claim. See C-
PHB §493 (“The domestic content requirements that were imposed by Ontario caused harm to the
Investor. The requirements were mandated by the Green Energy and Green Economy Act and the
Minister's Direction establishing the FIT Program, and were detailed in Exhibit D to the FIT Contract.”).

71

Government of Ontario are attributable to it.°* However, it disputes the attribution of acts
of the OPA, IESO and Hydro One.

340. Before entering into the analysis of attribution, there is an initial question of
characterisation. It is Canada’s case that its objection goes to the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal. This, however, is not the Tribunal’s view. While the distinction makes no
relevant difference in this case where jurisdiction and merits are joined, on a proper
analysis questions of attribution such as those that arise in this case concern the
responsibility of a State party for the acts and omissions of others. Whether or not a
State party is indeed so responsible is ordinarily a matter concerning the State party's
liability, and as such within a tribunal's competence to determine. It does not generally
govern the competence of the tribunal to hear the case itself. Further (and in any event)
attribution is generally best dealt with at the merits stage. This is subject to a prima facie
pro tem test being performed in the context of jurisdiction to ascertain that the acts
alleged are susceptible of constituting treaty breaches, which test is met here. This was
also the approach followed by the tribunals in Jan de Nul® and Hamester.®° The latter
tribunal held:

“[A]s a practical matter, [attribution] is usually best dealt with at the merits
stage, in order to allow for an in-depth analysis of all the parameters of the
complex relationship between certain acts and the State.”®”

34

. As a further preliminary observation, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant’s position in
respect of the status of the OPA, Hydro One and IESO is not clear. In its Memorial, the
Claimant argued that the OPA was an organ of Canada pursuant to Article 4 of the ILC
Articles, and that it was a state enterprise under Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA.® It also
argued that Hydro One and IESO were “state enterprises” in accordance with the

8 Tr. (31 October 2014) 159:18-22 (“[Canada does] not dispute that the decisions taken by the
Government of Ontario are attributable to the Government of Canada. Of course, the actions of sub-
national governments are attributable under the NAFTA.”).

responsibility to ensure adequate supervision and control of the OPA under Article 1503(2) of the

definition of the term in Annex 1505.® In its Reply, however, it argued that the OPA’s
acts were attributable to Canada pursuant to Article 8 (not Article 4%) of the ILC Articles,
and that the OPA was not a state enterprise under Annex 1505 but under Article 201 of
the NAFTA. At the hearing and in its submissions thereafter, the Claimant reiterated
its Article 8 ILC argument.°* However, it also submitted that the OPA “should [...] be
properly regarded as an organ of Canada.”%° In these circumstances, rather than
focusing on the Parties’ arguments, the Tribunal will proceed to examine the facts
necessary to determine the status of the OPA, Hydro One and IESO irrespective of
whether they have been pleaded in the context of Articles 4, 5 or 8 of the ILC Articles.

a. Article 4 of the ILC Articles

342. Article 4 of the ILC Articles sets out the basic rule that the conduct of a State organ is an
act of the State and is thus necessarily attributable to the State:

“Article 4 - Conduct of organs of a State

1.The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State
under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive,
judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization
of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central
Government or of a territorial unit of the State.

2.An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in
accordance with the internal law of the State.”

343. In its initial submissions, the Claimant took the position that the OPA was an “organ”
under Article 4 ILC Articles.°* The Tribunal cannot agree with this characterization. As
will be seen in greater detail below, the OPA, Hydro One and IESO are all corporations ®

89 Mem. §92 (“As the IESO is a state enterprise pursuant to the definition in Annex 1505”); §101 (“Hydro
One is a state enterprise pursuant to the definition in Annex 1505.”).

80 Mem. §863 (“The Investor's Memorial detailed how Canada is responsible for the actions of the
Ontario Power Authority. Canada has this responsibility because of Article 8 of the ILC Articles of State
Responsibility.”).

81 Reply fn. 217 (“[...] the OPA does not meet the Canadian-specific definition for a state enterprise in
Annex 1505 for the purposes of Chapter Fifteen, but the Ontario Power Authority meets the definition
of state enterprise for the purposes of the general Article 201 definition of state enterprise which is
applicable in NAFTA Chapter Eleven.”).

% Tr. (31 October 2014) 120:1-3 (“Just to be clear, the course of conduct of the OPA is attributable to
the government as a result of ILC Article 8.”); C-PHB §§361(b), 362-366.

with independent legal personality. Section 25.3 of the Electricity Restructuring Act, the
statute that created the OPA, specifically provides that the OPA is not a Crown agent for
any purposes. The position is the same in respect of Hydro One and IESO.°”

344. There are no Ontario laws which define the organs of the Government of Ontario in the

meaning of Article 4(2) of the ILC Articles. The Claimant relies, however, on a so-called
“All Agencies List” in support of its contention that the OPA is an organ of the
Government. That list does not support Mesa’s position. The All Agencies List was drawn
up by Ontario’s Public Appointments Secretariat to provide information to persons
wishing to serve on a government agency or non-classified entity.°* It describes the OPA,
Hydro One, and IESO as “non-classified entities”, i.e. as entities that are not “provincial
government organization{s].”°°

345. In the circumstances, the Tribunal sees no basis for holding that the OPA, Hydro One

and the IESO are organs of Canada under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.

346. The fact that these entities were characterised as “public bodies” by the World Trade

96

7

98

99

Organization (“WTO”) Panel'® and Appellate Body’ does not lead to a different
conclusion. The WTO Panel and Appellate Body considered these entities as “public
bodies” within the meaning of Article 1.1(a)(1) of the Agreement on Subsidies and
Countervailing Measures (the “SCM Agreement”), which is a substantially different
context and is thus of little assistance for present purposes. Confronted with the same
argument about the characterization of Canada Post as a public body by a WTO Panel,
the UPS tribunal emphasized the difference in the following terms:

“[T]he provisions of the GATT considered in that case do not distinguish,
as chapters 11 and 15 of NAFTA plainly and carefully do, between organs

of a State of a standard type (like the Canadian Post Office before 1981)
and various other forms of State enterprises.”'°

347. Accordingly, nothing in the WTO Panel and Appellate Body’s characterization of OPA,
IESO and Hydro One as public bodies under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (“GATT”) and SCM Agreement changes the Tribunal’s conclusion with respect to
these entities.

b. Article 5 of the ILC Articles

348. Article 5 of the ILC Articles provides that the acts of entities which are not organs but
exercise governmental authority may be attributable to the State if they are carried out
in that capacity:

“Article 5 - Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of
governmental authority

The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under
article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise
elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the
State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that
capacity in the particular instance.”

349. The Respondent submits that the OPA, Hydro One and IESO are all state enterprises.
Therefore, so says Canada, Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA creates a /ex specialis with
respect to the attribution of the acts of these entities, which displaces Article 5 of the ILC
Articles. To address this submission, the Tribunal will first determine whether the OPA,
Hydro One and IESO are state enterprises ((i) below). It will then examine the
Respondent's /ex specialis argument ((ii) below), '°* and will finally review whether the
impugned conduct of the OPA, Hydro One and IESO is attributable to Canada ((iii)
below).

i. Status of OPA, Hydro One and IESO

350. A “state enterprise” is defined in Article 201 of the NAFTA as follows:

102 Exh. RL-075, United Parcel Service of America, Inc. v. Government of Canada (UNCITRAL) Award
on the Merits, 24 May 2007, §61 (“UPS”).

103 C-Mem. §292.

104 C-PHB §364 (“The provisions of NAFTA Chapter Fifteen create a lex specialis that excludes the
application of ILC Article 5, as both rules govern the same situation.”).

75

“state enterprise means an enterprise that is owned, or controlled through
ownership interests, by a Party”

351. The term is also defined in almost identical terms in Article 1505:

“For purposes of this Chapter:

state enterprise means, except as set out in Annex 1505, an enterprise
owned, or controlled through ownership interests, by a Party.”

352. The Claimant argues that the OPA, Hydro One and IESO are not state enterprises for
the purposes of Article 1505 because they do not meet the specific definition for a state
enterprise set forth in Annex 1505. The Tribunal disagrees.

353. By its own terms, Annex 1505 applies only to Article 1503(3)' and not to Article
1503(2) 1%:

“Annex 1505: Country-Specific Definitions of State Enterprises
For purposes of Article 1503(3), ‘state enterprise’:

(a) with respect to Canada, means a Crown corporation within the meaning
of the Financial Administration Act (Canada), a Crown corporation within
the meaning of any comparable provincial law or equivalent entity that is
incorporated under other applicable provincial law; and

[.J"

354. The terms of the Treaty are thus clear: Canada’s country-specific definition in Annex
1505 does not apply to Article 1503(2). Rather, the definition of “state enterprise” that
governs is the one set out in Article 1505, which is identical to the definition in Article
201. Consequently, for the present purposes, a state enterprise is one which is “owned,
or controlled through ownership interests, by a Party.”

105 Article 1503(3) provides: “Each Party shall ensure that any state enterprise that it maintains or
establishes accords non-discriminatory treatment in the sale of its goods or services to investments in
the Party's territory of investors of another Party.”

106 Article 1503(2) provides: “Each Party shall ensure, through regulatory control, administrative
supervision or the application of other measures, that any state enterprise that it maintains or
establishes acts in a manner that is not inconsistent with the Party's obligations under Chapters Eleven
(Investment) and Fourteen (Financial Services) wherever such enterprise exercises any regulatory,
administrative or other governmental authority that the Party has delegated to it, such as the power to
expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions or impose quotas, fees or other charges.”

76

355. The Tribunal recalls that the Government of Ontario brought the OPA into existence
through the Electricity Restructuring Act, 2004.10’ Under this Act, the OPA was
responsible for overall long-term system planning, “activities in support of the goal of
ensuring adequate, reliable and secure electricity supply’, and the promotion of the
diversification of Ontario's electricity supply with a particular emphasis on renewable and
clean energy.'°° Operated on a not-for-profit basis, the OPA falls under the “legislative
responsibility” of the Ministry of Energy.‘ It receives and executes directives from the
Minister of Energy.'’° Further, the Minister appoints the members of the Board of
Directors of the OPA who are responsible for managing the OPA’s business and
affairs.‘‘’ He or she may equally dismiss an individual from the Board.''? The Minister
also has the sole power to approve the business plan of the OPA." In addition, he or
she approves the draft by-laws prepared by the OPA.‘ At any time, the Government of
Ontario could decide to dissolve and liquidate the OPA. If the OPA is wound up, the
remaining property following payment of all debts and liabilities would belong to the
Government."'5 All of these elements lead the Tribunal to conclude that the OPA is
“owned or controlled” by Canada. Thus, the OPA is a state enterprise under Article 1505
and Article 201 of the NAFTA.

356. As for Hydro One and IESO, as mentioned above, the Claimant agrees that these two
entities are “state enterprises” pursuant to the definition of the term in Annex 1505. 1"®
But for the reasons mentioned above, Article 1505 is relevant and not Annex 1505. The
Tribunal concludes that Hydro One and IESO meet the definition under Article 1505. The
Ministry of Energy is the sole shareholder of Hydro One and is entitled to acquire, hold
and dispose of Hydro One’s assets and liabilities.” Hydro One falls within the

Having reached the conclusion that the OPA, Hydro One and IESO are all state
enterprises, the Tribunal now proceeds to review whether Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA
replaces the ordinary rules of attribution found in Article 5 of the ILC Articles or, in other

words, whether the former constitutes a /ex specialis prevailing over the latter.
ii. Article 1503(2) and Article 5 of the ILC Articles

The Tribunal first notes that the ILC Articles are residual rules in the sense that they only
come into play where no special rules are applicable. This is borne out by Article 55 of

the ILC Articles which bears the heading “lex specialis” in the following terms:

“Lex specialis

These articles do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for
the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or
implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed
by special rules of international law.”

Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA, for its part, reads as follows:

“Article 1503: State Enterprises
‘Le]

2. Each Party shall ensure, through regulatory control, administrative
supervision or the application of other measures, that any state enterprise
that it maintains or establishes acts in a manner that is not inconsistent
with the Party's obligations under Chapters Eleven (Investment) and
Fourteen (Financial Services) wherever such enterprise exercises any

363.

regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority that the Party
has delegated to it, such as the power to expropriate, grant licenses,
approve commercial transactions or impose quotas, fees or other charges.”

Article 1503(2) thus addresses situations in which the acts of a state enterprise are
impugned. It provides that a NAFTA Party is responsible for the acts of a state enterprise
in respect of Chapter 11 (and 14) only in cases where that state enterprise exercises
regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority delegated to it by that NAFTA
Party.

In other words, Chapters 11 and 15 of the NAFTA distinguish between the obligations
of a NAFTA Party itself (specified in Chapter 11), and the obligations of a NAFTA Party
in respect of its state enterprises (specified in Chapter 15). For the latter, a NAFTA Party
must ensure that its enterprises do not act in a manner inconsistent with the obligations
imposed on the NAFTA Party under Chapters 11 and 14 of the NAFTA (Article 1503(2)).
It must also ensure that its enterprises accord non-discriminatory treatment in the sale
of goods or services (Article 1503(3)). Thus, a NAFTA Party is not responsible for every
act of its enterprises. Rather, its responsibility is circumscribed by Articles 1503(2) and
1503(3). Furthermore, Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA limits the jurisdiction of a Chapter
11 tribunal to consider claims of a breach of Section A of Chapter 11 or of Article 1503(2).

The NAFTA thus establishes a special regime which distinguishes between a NAFTA
Party and its enterprises, specifies what control obligations the former has over the latter,
and thus organises the NAFTA Party's responsibility for acts of its enterprises. This
regime cannot be displaced by the ILC Articles, which, as mentioned above, are residual
in nature. Indeed, if the ILC Articles were to apply, then the conduct of a state enterprise
discriminating in the sale of its goods or services would be attributable to that NAFTA
Party. This would mean that a NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunal would have to consider such
conduct, although Article 1116(1) restricts its jurisdiction to claims of breach of Article
1503(2). As a result, the Tribunal concludes that Article 1503(2) constitutes a lex
specialis that excludes the application of Article 5 of the ILC Articles. The Claimant
agrees with this position. '5

The tribunal in UPS, after a careful consideration of these provisions, reached the same
conclusion:

125 C-PHB §364 (“The provisions of NAFTA Chapter Fifteen create a lex specialis that excludes the
application of ILC Article 5, as both rules govern the same situation.”).

79

364.

365.

366.

“Chapter 15 provides for a lex specialis regime in relation to the attribution
of acts of monopolies and state enterprises, to the content of the
obligations and to the method of implementation. It follows that the
customary international law rules reflected in article 4 of the ILC text do not
apply in this case.

[-]

It will be recalled that UPS also contends, as an alternative to the argument
based on the rules of customary international law reflected in article 4 of
the ILC text, that the proposition reflected in its article 5 apply to make
Canada directly responsible for actions of Canada Post.

[-]

We again recall however that the proposition in article 5 of the ILC text (as
in other provisions) has — a ‘residual character’ and does not apply to the
extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful
act or the content or implementation of a State‘s international responsibility
are governed by special rules of international law — the lex specialis
principle (paragraph 55 above). For the reasons which we have just given
[...], and in particular the careful structuring and drafting of chapters 11
and 15 [....], we find that this argument also fails, as a general
proposition.”'26

As a consequence, the responsibility regime arising from Article 1503(2) prevails over
the residual rules of Article 5 of the ILC Articles. The acts of the OPA, Hydro One and
IESO will accordingly be attributable to Canada if these enterprises were exercising
regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority as specified in Article 1503(2)
when they carried out the acts in question.

Having concluded that the OPA, Hydro One and IESO are state enterprises and that
Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA governs attribution, the Tribunal can dispense with
reviewing whether their acts are attributable to Canada pursuant to Article 8 of the ILC
Articles.

iii. Conduct of the OPA, Hydro One and IESO

It follows from the preceding discussion that the Tribunal must now assess whether the
impugned acts of the OPA, Hydro One and IESO were carried out in the exercise of
regulatory, administrative, or other governmental authority. In the affirmative, these acts
would be attributable to Canada.

126 UPS §§62-63.

80

367. The term “governmental authority” is not defined in the NAFTA. In the context of ILC

Article 5, the tribunal in Jan de Nul held that “governmental authority” meant the use of

“prérogatives de puissance publique.”'2” As the reference to governmental authority

appears in Article 1503(2) as well as in Article 5, it seems appropriate to rely on the

meaning so circumscribed. Therefore, to decide whether OPA, Hydro One and IESO

exercised governmental authority when performing the acts challenged by Mesa, the

Tribunal must assess whether these entities exercised sovereign power, examples of

which are provided in Article 1503(2) itself (the power to expropriate, grant licenses,

approve commercial transactions or impose quotas, fees or other charges).

368. As mentioned above, the following acts of the OPA have been challenged:

vi.

vii.

All versions of the FIT Rules in particular Rule 6.4(a)(i) of Version 1.1,
which required projects that became operational after 1 January 2012
to achieve 50% domestic content;

The FIT Contract, in particular Section 2.4(b)(iii) and Annex D;

The alleged failure to follow the FIT Rules with respect to the ranking

and evaluation of applications;

The decision taken in August 2010 not to run the ECT;

The allegedly better treatment offered by the OPA to other FIT
applicants, and the OPA’s meetings with other FIT applicants which
led to benefits not available to the Claimant being granted to these
applicants; '°

The release of the FIT Program rankings on 21 December 2010;

The OPA’s alleged misadministration of the FIT Program;

127 Jan de Nul §170; Hamester §202 ([i]t is not enough for an act of a public entity to have been
performed in the general fulfilment of some general interest, mission or purpose to qualify as an

attributable act.”).

viii. | The OPA’s decision on the information to be included in the TAT
tables;

ix. The OPA’s decision to offer NextEra a FIT Contract with connection
points on the 500 kV Bruce to Longwood Line;

x. The award of the FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011.

As it held earlier, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over items (i) and (ii) (§334). Its review
is consequently limited to the acts enumerated in items (iii) to (x).

The Tribunal recalls that section 25.35(1) of the Electricity Act provides that “the Minister
may direct the OPA to develop a feed-in-tariff program [...] under such circumstances
and conditions, in consideration of such factors and within such period as the Minister
may require.” Acting under this provision, on 24 September 2009, the Minister of Energy
directed the OPA to “develop a feed-in tariff (‘FIT’) program.”'?® That same direction
required the OPA to create rules that “[p]roponents will have to comply with.”"*° It further
specified that it was the Minister's “expectation that the OPA will establish appropriate
policies and procedures with respect to the administration of the Programs.”'31

In these circumstances, the Tribunal believes that by preparing the FIT Rules and setting
out the ranking and evaluation criteria for the applications to the FIT Program, the OPA
was acting in the exercise of delegated governmental authority. Thus, the OPA’s acts in
ranking and evaluating the FIT Applications are attributable to Canada.

The Tribunal also recalls that the Electricity Act (as amended) empowered the OPA to
perform the following tasks:

“[E]nter into contracts relating to the procurement of electricity supply and
capacity in or outside Ontario; [and]

enter into contracts relating to the procurement of electricity supply and
capacity using alternative energy sources or renewable energy sources to

374.

375.

376.

assist the Government of Ontario in achieving goals in the development
and use of alternative or renewable energy technology and resources;” ‘32

The OPA’s authority to enter into contracts is repeated in section 25.32(1)(a) of the
Electricity Act (as amended), which reads as follows:

“25.32 (1) When the OPA considers it advisable, it shall enter into contracts
in accordance with procurement processes approved under section 25.31
for the procurement of

(a) electricity supply or capacity, including supply or capacity to be
generated using alternative energy sources, renewable energy sources or
both.” 193

The Tribunal further observes that although the OPA had the power to enter into
contracts, the award of FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011 was the result of events that had
taken place prior to that date. Indeed, the award of contracts resulted from a combination
of the OPA’s evaluation and ranking process and the reduction of capacity because of
the LTEP and the GEIA.

As a result, the Tribunal believes that in carrying out the act listed at items (iii) to (x)
above, the OPA was exercising delegated governmental authority.

The position is the same when it comes to the controversial acts of Hydro One and IESO.
However, for these entities, the Tribunal notes that the only acts challenged are that
IESO was part of the “Korean Consortium Working Group” and that, in 2010 and 2011,
IESO and Hydro One met with the Claimant's competitors to discuss a connection to a
500 kV transmission line.** Mesa has not substantiated its allegations against these
entities, nor has it sufficiently explained how the acts of these entities resulted in a breach
of Article 1105(1). In any event, it appears that the Claimant no longer pursues claims
concerning Hydro One and IESO, at least not in respect of Chapter 15 of the NAFTA. ‘5

135 Reply §§874-875 (“Since the full extent of the violations of the NAFTA have taken place by the
actions of officials of the Government of Ontario, or through measures which occurred through the
mandatory direction of such officials by the Ontario Power Authority, there is no need to maintain any
further Chapter Fifteen claims against the other Ontario entities such as the IESO or Hydro One [...]
Canada has full responsibility for these measures taken by officials of the Government of Ontario or by
the Ontario Power Authority under the direction of Ontario (emphasis supplied)”).

83

377.

378.

379.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal will not further review the Claimant's allegations in
respect of IESO and Hydro One.

The Tribunal concludes, therefore, that the OPA, Hydro One and IESO are state
enterprises, and that the OPA’s acts identified in §368(iii) to (x) are attributable to
Canada, since they were all done in the exercise of regulatory, administrative or other
governmental authority. As a consequence, the Tribunal will examine below whether the
OPA’s conduct in the exercise of this authority was wrongful.

C. PROCUREMENT EXCEPTION

1. The Respondent’s Position

. According to the Respondent, the FIT Program is a procurement process designed by a
NAFTA Party and implemented by a state enterprise. The obligations established in
Articles 1102, 1103 and 1106(1)(b) of the NAFTA do not apply to Mesa’s investment,
because the FIT Program constitutes or involves “procurement” under Articles
1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b) of the NAFTA. Article 1108 expressly preserves the NAFTA
Parties’ right to pursue policy objectives through procurement, even where they impose
performance requirements or amount to discriminatory treatment.

The Respondent notes that Chapter 11 does not define the term “procurement”. The
term has, however, been considered in ADF v. U.S.'°° and UPS v. Canada,'*’ both of
which adopted broad interpretations. The WTO Panel and Appellate Body in Canada —
Renewable Energy'® also took an expansive approach. On this basis, the Respondent
concludes:

“[T]he ordinary meaning of the term ‘procurement’, as it is used in Article
1108, covers all measures constituting or involving the lease or purchase
of goods or services for any purpose, regardless of whether the
government ultimately paid the cost, and regardless of whether the
government retained possession of the end product. Understood in
accordance with this plain language interpretation, the FIT Program
constitutes procurement for the purposes of Article 1108.”199

137 UPS §§ 121-136.

138 Panel Report, §7.131; Appellate Body Report, §5.59.
139 C-Mem. §314.

84

380. The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s invocation of the most favored-nation-

38

clause in Article 1103 and the 2009 Canada-Czech Republic Foreign Investor Promotion
and Protection Agreement (“Canada-Czech Republic FIPA’). It submits that Article
1103 cannot be used to exclude Article 1108, when the very purpose of Article 1108 is
to condition the application of Article 1103. It adds that Mesa has in any event not shown
that the requirements of Article 1103 are fulfilled.

. The Respondent also disagrees with the Claimant's argument that the requirements of

GATT Article Ill and NAFTA Chapter 10 should be imported into Article 1108. None of
these requirements apply in this case inter alia because:

i. Article 1108(7) contains nothing more than the term “procurement”,
unrestricted in any way and unencumbered by any conditions. In
particular, none of the additional elements contained in GATT Article
I1I:8(a) are found in Article 1108(7);

ii. | The NAFTA Parties expressly “carved-out” all procurement measures
in Article 1108 because they wanted to negotiate separate obligations
with respect to procurement. In Chapter 10, the NAFTA Parties
specified the forms of procurement subject to obligations and the
content of these obligations. Chapter 10 in no way modifies the
exclusion created in Article 1108 for the purposes of Chapter 11;

iii. Article 1001(5) does not contain a general definition of procurement
for all of the NAFTA Chapters. The exception found in Article 1108 for
purposes of Chapter 11 applies irrespective of obligations which the
NAFTA Parties may have undertaken with respect to procurement in
Chapter 10. The importation of Article 1001(5) into Article 1108 was
also implicitly rejected by the ADF and UPS tribunals.

382. The Respondent further opposes the Claimant's submission that procurement in Article

1108 requires that the goods or services be procured for the benefit or use of the
government. It notes that nothing in the text of Article 1108 requires that procurement be
for government use or benefit. It also points out that governments frequently procure on
behalf of the people they govern. In addition, if the element of benefit or use were part
of the ordinary meaning of procurement, then Canada would not have had to explicitly

85

383.

384.

385.

386.

mention it in the Government Procurement Agreement on which the Claimant itself
relies.

Moreover, the Respondent denies that procurement in Article 1108 requires that the
government take possession of or title to the goods and services procured. Such a
limitation is not in line with the ordinary meaning of the term; and it would render the
Article 1108 preclusion inapplicable to the procurement of services, which are not
capable of being possessed or owned.

Finally, the Respondent opposes the Claimant's submission that the measures
impugned by the Claimant are not linked to procurement under the FIT Program. It
stresses that all the claims are based on the design and implementation of the FIT
Program, and the Claimant's failure to obtain a FIT Contract.

2. The Claimant’s Position

. The Claimant submits that the procurement exception in Article 1108 derogates from key
principles of the NAFTA and that the “potential for abuse is great.”"“° As a consequence,
the provision must be interpreted restrictively “in order to meet the interpretative
requirements specific to the NAFTA, and the definitive statements within NAFTA itself of
its object and purpose.”"" It further argues that, as the party relying upon the exception,
the Respondent must establish that the measures in question fit within the meaning of
the exception.

According to the Claimant, the Tribunal should deny Canada’s procurement defense
because of the better treatment provided under the Canada-Czech FIPA and the
Canada-Slovak Republic Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments
(the “Slovak Treaty”). While the Slovak Treaty imposes identical national and MFN
treatment obligations as the NAFTA, it contains no procurement exception. Thus, an
investor under that treaty would receive more favorable treatment from Canada than an
investor under the NAFTA, who would be subject to the procurement exception.

140 Mem. §465.
141 Reply §192.

86

387.

388.

389.

Even if the Tribunal were to consider the Respondent’s defense, the latter would in any
event fail, so the Claimant submits, because Article 1108 does not apply to provincial
governments under Article 1005(1) of the NAFTA.

The Claimant points out that Article 1108 does not define “procurement”, while Article
1001(5) does. For the Claimant, it is logical that the drafters of the NAFTA presumed
that the meaning of “procurement” would be internally consistent within the NAFTA,
unless a contrary intention was expressed. Thus, in the absence of a definition in
Chapter 11, the one found in Article 1001(5) should be used. What matters under that
definition is that the government obtains goods and services for itself, not for others. This
understanding conforms to the ordinary meaning of the term “procurement” in
international economic law. Mesa also notes that, in its submissions before the tribunal
in UPS, Canada itself argued that the absence of a definition of “procurement” meant
that the Parties intended the term to be given its ordinary meaning throughout the
NAFTA, subject to the exclusions in Article 1001(5). The tribunals in ADF and UPS also
relied on Article 1001(5) to understand the context and meaning of the term
“procurement” in Article 1108. In any event, Article 1112 provides that, in the event of an
inconsistency between Chapter 11 and another Chapter, the provision in the other
chapter should prevail. Thus, even if the meaning of “procurement” in Chapter 11 was
inconsistent with the one found in Chapter 10, the Chapter 10 meaning must be given

preference. ‘4?

Further, by operation of Article 1131(1) and Article 33(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the
Tribunal should take into account international law as well as applicable usages of trade.
In the Claimant's opinion, recourse should thus be made to the meaning of procurement
in international economic law, such as in the GATT Article III:8(a) and the WTO
Agreement on Government Procurement (“GPA”). In Canada's General Notes to
Appendix 1 of the GPA, Canada defines procurement as “contractual transactions to
acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the government”. On this
basis, the Claimant insists that there is only one meaning of “procurement”;
“procurement” simply does not apply to products purchased to be resold to customers.

(‘Claimant’s First Article 1128 Response”) §105.

393.

. Finally, the Claimant asserts that “the FIT cannot constitute government procurement
[...] because the ratepayers paid for all the electricity generated”"*° and that “Ontario
designed the program [such that] it could never be a governmental procurement because
the government doesn't pay.”"* For the Claimant, the transaction that takes place under
a FIT Contract is “akin to a markets based settlement and financial transaction”, 4° and
not procurement. It notes that while the OPA executes a contract which purports to
purchase renewable power from generators, it does not acquire title, possession or

control of the electricity produced.

Even if Canada could establish that the OPA’s activity constitutes procurement, its
defense would still fail, because Canada had not established any connection between
the disputed measures and the procurement of electricity. In other words, “[t]here is
simply no link between the discriminatory treatment in question and the purposes of the
‘procurement of electricity. Indeed, the effect of the discriminatory treatment is to make
the supply of renewable generated electricity to Ontario consumers less efficient and

more expensive.” 146

3. The Non-Disputing Parties’ Position

. Mexico disagrees with the Claimant's contention that the provisions of Article 1103 and
the Canada—Czech FIPA can be relied upon to exclude the application of Article 1108 of
the NAFTA. It considers that “Article 1103 applies to actual instances of treatment [...]
The fact that another treaty theoretically offers different treatment is insufficient to

establish a violation of Article 1103.”

Mexico further states that the ordinary meaning of the term “procurement” in Article 1108
is broad and should not be limited by Article 1001(5). The definition of “procurement” in
Article 1001 only applies in the context of Chapter 10 of the NAFTA; it was not intended
to have effects in the framework of other chapters such as Chapter 11. Finally, it notes
that there are important differences in language between the wording of GATT Article
Ill:8(a) and NAFTA Article 1108.

88

394.

For the U.S., while the term “procurement” is not defined in the NAFTA, its ordinary
meaning “encompasses any and all forms of procurement by a NAFTA Party.” This is
confirmed by the French and Spanish versions of the NAFTA, which use the generic
term for “purchases” in those languages. Further, the United States agrees with the
Respondent that Chapter 11 uses the term as a broad “carve-out”, whereas Chapter 10

refers to it as a “carve-in’.

Articles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b) of the NAFTA provide as follows:

“7. Articles 1102, 1103 and 1107 do not apply to:
(a) Procurement by a Party or a State enterprise; [...]
8. The provisions of:

L..]
Article 1106(1)(b) [...] do not apply to procurement by a Party or a State
enterprise;

[.J"

Accordingly, if the FIT Program constitutes procurement by a Party or a State enterprise,
a number of guarantees invoked by Mesa would not apply, specifically Articles 1102
(national treatment), 1103 (most favored nation treatment), and 1106(1)(b) (domestic

content). "47

For the reasons discussed above (§§324 et. seq.), the Tribunal considers that it lacks
jurisdiction over the domestic content claims. Thus, it will not further analyze these
claims and will not consider the Respondent's arguments according to which Article

1108(8)(b) excludes the domestic content claims.

The Tribunal does, however, have jurisdiction over the MFN and NT claims. It will
therefore consider Canada’s position that it cannot entertain these claims as a result of
Article 1108(7)(a).

The Tribunal will first address the Claimant's argument that the MFN provision (Article
1103), read together with the Canada-Czech FIPA or the Slovak Treaty, precludes the

application of Article 1108 of the NAFTA ((a) below). It will then review whether the FIT
Program constitutes “procurement” ((b) below) by a Party or state enterprise ((c) below).

a. Whether Article 1103 precludes the application of Article 1108

The Claimant submits that because neither the Canada-Czech FIPA nor the Slovak
Treaty contains a procurement exemption like the one found in Article 1108(7)(a), Mesa
can avoid the application of this exemption by relying on the MFN provision in Article
1103 of the NAFTA, which requires that the Claimant be treated no less favorably than
a Czech or Slovak investor. Put differently, relying on Article 1103 and the allegedly more
favorable standards of protection in the Canada-Czech FIPA and the Slovak Treaty, the
Claimant submits that Article 1108(7)(a) does not apply to Mesa. The Tribunal cannot

accept this position.

For an MFN clause in a base treaty to allow the importation of a more favorable standard
of protection from a third party treaty, the applicability of the MFN clause in the base
treaty must first be established. Put differently, one must first be under the treaty to claim
through the treaty. '*® Thus, the Claimant must first establish that the MFN provision of
the base treaty applies. Then, relying on that provision, it may be able to import a more
favorable standard of protection from a third party treaty. Here, the base treaty is the
NAFTA. Thus, the Claimant must first establish that the MFN provision, i.e. Article 1103
of the NAFTA, is applicable. As Article 1108(7)(a) expressly excludes the application of
Article 1103 in cases of procurement by a Party or State enterprise, for the Claimant to
establish that Article 1103 of the NAFTA applies, it must show that the FIT Program does

not constitute procurement.

For the reasons set forth below, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that the FIT
Program does constitute procurement. Thus, by virtue of Article 1108(7)(a), the MFN
provision enshrined in Article 1103 cannot apply. As a result, the Claimant cannot rely
on that provision to import the allegedly more favorable provisions of the Canada-Czech
FIPA or of the Slovak Treaty.

&

. If one were to follow Mesa’s interpretation, an investor would be able to avoid the
application of Article 1108(7)(a) by relying on Article 1103, although Article 1108(7)(a)
expressly prohibits such use of Article 1103. This result would be contrary to the rule of

effet utile in treaty interpretation. ‘4°

b. The FIT Program constitutes “procurement”

Article 1108 excludes the application of non-discrimination standards and performance
requirements in the event of “procurement by a Party or a state enterprise”. It contains,
however, no definition of the term “procurement”. Accordingly, it falls on the Tribunal to
determine the meaning of this term, as part of the phrase “procurement by a Party or a

state enterprise”.

Mesa suggests that Article 1108(7)(a) must be interpreted restrictively because it is an
exception. The Tribunal does not consider that the mere characterization of a treaty term
as an “exception” requires an interpretation different from other treaty terms. Indeed,
whatever their characterization, all terms of a treaty are subject to the ordinary rules of
treaty interpretation. This was also the conclusion of the tribunal in Mobil v. Canada
which, in the specific context of Article 1108, disavowed any restrictive interpretation:

“[t]he task of ascertaining the meaning of a reservation, like the task of
interpreting any other treaty text, involves understanding the intention of
the NAFTA Parties, and it is to be achieved by following the customary
rules of interpretation of public international law, as reflected in Articles 31
and 32 of the VCLT.”"°

Consequently, the Tribunal will determine the meaning of “procurement” by reference to
the principles of treaty interpretation set out above (§§231 et. seq.). It will give the term
“procurement” its ordinary meaning, in its context, in light of the object and purpose of
the NAFTA.

In its ordinary meaning, “procure” (whether or not by a state or a state enterprise) means
“to get; to gain; to come into possession of.”'*' The French and Spanish texts of the
NAFTA use the generic term for “purchases” in Article 1108.1?

Two NAFTA tribunals, ADF and UPS have considered the meaning of “procurement” in
Article 1108(7)(a). In ADF, the dispute arose out of the claim of a Canadian steel supplier
participating as a sub-contractor in a highway construction project. The governmental
entity responsible for the construction, the Virginia Department of Transportation,
received federal funding to implement the project. The use of federal funds triggered the
application of the Buy America Act, a statute which favors domestic producers
participating in government-funded projects. In reaching its conclusion that the
procurement exception applied, the tribunal observed that the term “procurement” in
Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA was to be understood broadly:

“In its ordinary or dictionary connotation, ‘procurement’ refers to the act of
obtaining, as by effort, labor or purchase. To procure means to ‘get; to gain;
to come into possession of’. In the world of commerce and industry,
‘procurement’ may be seen to refer ordinarily to the activity of obtaining by
purchase goods, supplies, services and so forth. Thus, governmental
procurement refers to the obtaining by purchase by a governmental agency
or entity of title to or possession of, for instance, goods, supplies, materials
and machinery.”*8?

In UPS, the Canadian customs service had entered into a contract entitled “Postal
Imports Agreement” (the “PIA”) with Canada Post. Under the PIA, Canada Post was to
render services including the collection of customs duties and excise taxes from the
addressees of postal parcels. Canadian Customs paid a fee to Canada Post in
consideration for these services. The claimant UPS, a US investor, alleged that it had
received less favorable treatment than Canada Post under the PIA. Canada invoked the
procurement defense under Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA arguing that the national
treatment provision did not apply to the PIA as it was a procurement contract. The
tribunal upheld Canada’s defense. It noted that under the PIA, Canadian Customs, a

182 Article 1108(7) of the NAFTA (“Les articles 1102, 1103 et 1107 ne s’appliquent pas: a) aux achats

”); (‘Los Articulos 1102, 1103 y 1107 no se aplican a: (a) las compras

English, French and Spanish texts of this Agreement are equally authentic.”
183 ADF §161.

92

governmental entity, acquired a service from Canada Post. Relying on ADF,'™ it
concluded that “the PIA is clearly a procurement contract under which Canada Post
performs services for Customs for a fee.”

410. All three NAFTA Parties appear to support the broad notion of procurement as advanced
by the tribunals in ADF and UPS. 1%
411. This broad notion is further buttressed by the WTO Panel and Appellate Body in their

decisions on whether the FIT program involved government procurement in the context
of Article III:8(a) of the GATT. In Canada-Renewable Energy, both the Panel and the
Appellate Body were inter alia called upon to determine whether the domestic content
requirements of the FIT Program contravened Article III:8(a) of the GATT.

412. While most of its findings were made in the specific context of Article III:8(a) of the GATT
(which, as the Tribunal observes later, is different to Article 1108 in material respects),
the Panel nevertheless concluded that the ordinary meaning of procurement was broad:

“As the parties have explained, the ordinary meaning of the word
‘procurement’ includes ‘[t]he action of obtaining something; an acquisition’.
Article III:8(a) refers to ‘procurement by governmental agencies of products
purchased’. The ordinary meanings of the word ‘purchase’ advanced by
the parties include ‘to obtain; to gain possession of’ and ‘to acquire in
exchange for payment in money or an equivalent; to buy’ [...] in our view,
to the extent that the ordinary meanings of both words refer to the action
of ‘obtaining’ or ‘acquiring’ something, they support a conclusion that
‘procurement’ and ‘purchase’ should be given the same meaning.”'5”

413. On appeal, the Appellate Body rejected the Panel’s findings that “purchase” and
“procurement” could be equated.'®® Nevertheless, it too observed that “procurement”
had a broad meaning, albeit one which was to be understood by reference to the
procedures of procurement:

154 UPS §131.

185 UPS §135. Prof. Cass issued a dissenting opinion in this case. According to him, the PIA could not
constitute procurement because (i) it was not regulated in ways comparable to government
procurement (there was no formal “agreement” or tender or evaluation process); and (ii) the structure
of the PIA was unlike ordinary procurement. As will be seen below, the Tribunal finds that the FIT
Program satisfies these requirements as well.

186 See Submission of the United States of America dated 25 July 2014 (“U.S. Article 1128
Submission”) §§15-17; and Submission of Mexico Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 dated 25 July 2014
(‘Mexico’s First Article 1128 Submission”) §§8-10.

187 Panel Report, §7.131.

188 Appellate Body Report §5.59.

93

“The term ‘procurement’ may refer generally to ‘[t]}he action of obtaining
something; acquisition’, or it may refer more specifically to ‘the action or
process of obtaining equipment and supplies’. In a more technical sense,
procurement usually refers to formal procedures used by governments to
acquire goods or services.”

414. Thus, the Appellate Body emphasized that procurement must be achieved through
formal government procedures. This formal nature of procurement is also emphasized
in the UNCITRAL Model Law on Public Procurement of 2014, which defines procurement
as acquisition of goods or services"? and provides for a formal procurement process
including tenders, assessment of qualifications, etc.

415. This notion of procurement — as a “formal” acquisition — is neither confirmed nor
contradicted by the context in which the term is used. The context is constituted by the
other relevant provisions of the NAFTA as well as by the general objectives of the NAFTA
identified in Article 102 of the NAFTA. 1

416. Several provisions of the NAFTA contain the term “procurement”:

e Article 1201(2)(c) sets out the scope and coverage of Chapter 12 (Cross-
Border Trade in Services) and is worded similarly to Article 1108(7)(a):
“Article 1201: Scope and Coverage
[-
2. This Chapter does not apply to:
[-]

procurement by a Party or a state enterprise”
e Article 1001 of the NAFTA provides in relevant part:

“Article 1001: Scope and Coverage

1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a
Party relating to procurement:

[-J
5. Procurement includes procurement by such methods as

purchase, lease or rental, with or without an option to buy.
Procurement does not include:

189 Article 2(j) (‘Procurement” or “public procurement” means the acquisition of goods, construction or
services by a procuring entity).

160 ADF §147.

94

(a) non-contractual agreements or any form of government
assistance, including cooperative agreements, grants, loans,
equity infusions, guarantees, fiscal incentives, and government
provision of goods and services to persons or state, provincial and
regional governments; and

(b) the acquisition of fiscal agency or depository services,
liquidation and management services for regulated financial
institutions and sale and distribution services for government
debt.”

e In Article 1502, the NAFTA Parties undertook obligations with respect to
measures adopted or maintained by certain monopolies. Article 1502(4)
contains an exception to those obligations for procurements in the following
terms:

“Paragraph 3 does not apply to procurement by governmental
agencies of goods or services for governmental purposes and not
with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the
production of goods or the provision of services for commercial
sale.”

417. These provisions provide little guidance on the interpretation of the term “procurement”
in Article 1108(7)(a). In its analysis, the Tribunal must look to the specific context in which
the term “procurement” has been used and must be “extremely careful not to interpret
expressions or concepts used in specific provisions in the light of the use of those or
similar expressions in other contexts”.'*' The term “procurement” appears in Chapter 3
(‘National Treatment and Market Access for Goods”); Chapter 10 (“Government
Procurement’); Chapter 12 (“Cross-Border Trade in Services”); and Chapter 15
(“Competition Policy, Monopolies and State Enterprises”). As is evident from the titles of
these chapters, each chapter regulates a different area. Some of these chapters have
been said to “stand virtually alone”"® in the NAFTA. Further, in Chapters 11, 12 and 15,
the term is used as a “carve-out”, precluding the application of substantive provisions,
while in Chapter 10 the term is used as a “carve-in”, allowing for and regulating the
application of substantive provisions. In other words, the term “procurement” is used in
different contexts in the NAFTA, serving different functions and for different purposes’,
and to regulate different subject areas. To the Tribunal, this means that the term must

2010, §86.

162 ADF §148 in the context of Chapter 15.
163 The relevance of this difference is explained in the context of the Tribunal’s analysis of the Claimant's
arguments on Article 1001(5) of the NAFTA.

95

be interpreted differently depending on the chapter and the specific context in which it is
used. Indeed, if this were not the case, then the term could have been included in Article
201 of the NAFTA, which defines terms for the purposes of the entire Agreement. Yet,
Article 201 contains no definition of “procurement.” In these circumstances, the Tribunal
believes that the other Chapters of NAFTA, aside from Chapter 11, provide only limited
context and guidance to understand the meaning of the term in Article 1108(7)(a) of the
NAFTA.

(ii) Object and Purpose

418. After the ordinary meaning and the context, the Tribunal then turns to object and
purpose. The overall objects and purposes of the NAFTA are set out in its Article 102(1),
and Article 102(2) provides that: “[t]he Parties shall interpret and apply the provisions of
this Agreement in the light of its objectives set out in paragraph 1 and in accordance with
applicable rules of international law”. These objects and purposes must obviously direct
the Tribunal’s enquiry, but they operate at a high level of generality, and Article 102(1)
itself provides that the objectives of the Treaty are elaborated more specifically through
its principles and rules. Hence, when considering the objects and purposes behind the
specific term “procurement”, the Tribunal must also focus on the objects and purposes
of the particular provision in which the term appears. And for this, the Tribunal must
consider the text of the provision itself (here Article 1108). 1

419. Article 1108 is entitled “Reservations and Exceptions.” It excludes certain measures from
the substantive protections of Chapter 11. Article 1108(7)(a) excludes the application of
non-discrimination provisions (and performance requirements) to investments involving
procurement. The Tribunal understands that through the exception carved out by Article
1108(7)(a), the NAFTA Contracting Parties sought to protect their ability to exercise
nationality-based preferences in cases of procurement. As noted in ADF, the NAFTA
Contracting Parties, like many other countries, maintain domestic preference policies
when procuring goods and services:

“The Federal Government of Canada, for instance, provides heavy financial
assistance to the provinces for highway construction and many of the
provinces receiving this assistance enforce domestic preference regulations
in their procurement. In Mexico, too, federal law prescribes preferences for
Mexican goods and services in procurement by states wholly or partially

164 See ADF §147 (“The object and purpose of the parties to a treaty in agreeing upon any particular
paragraph of that treaty are to be found, in the first instance, in the words in fact used by the parties in
that paragraph. This is in line with Article 102(1)”).

96

420.

42

funded by the federal Mexican Government. [...] domestic requirements for
Government procurement are in place ‘in most, if not all, countries’.”"®°

It appears reasonable that a State be free to procure goods or services in a manner that
yields maximum benefits for the local economy. Government purchasing of goods and
services is an extremely important function, and procurement by way of formal
purchasing procedures is frequently utilised as an instrument of policy. To this end,
Article 1108(7)(a) allows for preferential treatment of local suppliers, when a Party is

engaged in formal purchasing of goods and services.

. The Tribunal notes that, in its view, it makes no difference to the analysis above whether

one focuses upon the single word “procurement’ or the phrase “procurement by a Party
or a state enterprise”. The words “... by a Party or a state enterprise” identify the entities
involved, but do not change the nature of the activity itself — which in this context
assumes a State Party or state enterprise in any event.

(iii) Claimant's Arguments on Interpretation

422.

423.

424.

425.

Having thus set out the contours of the term “procurement” above, the Tribunal now
proceeds to examine the Claimant's arguments on the interpretation of the term.

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal should rely on the definition of procurement in
Article 1001(5) when interpreting the term procurement in Article 1108(7)(a). It submits
that the FIT Program cannot constitute procurement because, through this Program, the
government is not purchasing goods for its own use, but for commercial resale. For the
reasons set out below, the Tribunal does not share this view.

First, Article 1108(7)(a) only contains the term “procurement”, without any limitation or
specification. As explained above, “procurement” is commonly understood to refer to a
formal acquisition, without a requirement that the acquisition be for the government's
own use. The term for procurement in the French and Spanish versions of Article 1108
(‘achats” and “compras” respectively) confirm this broad notion.

Second, Article 1108(7)(a) does not refer to Article 1001(5). If the NAFTA Parties had
intended to incorporate the limitations found in Article 1001(5) into Article 1108(7)(a),

165 ADF §94.

97

426.

427.

428.

429.

they could easily have done so. Indeed, other provisions of Article 1108 contain express
references to provisions of other chapters of the NAFTA.‘

It is further evident that the limitations of Article 1001(5) should not be read into Article
1108(7)(a) when one considers the purposes and functions of these provisions. Article
1001(5) is a “carve-in” rule, in the sense that it identifies types of procurement to which
the regime in Chapter 10 applies. The Chapter 10 regime does not apply to the types of
procurement that are specifically excluded by sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article
1001(5) (for instance, non-contractual agreements, the acquisition of fiscal agency or
depository services) — albeit these fall within the ordinary scope of “procurement” (and
hence the need specifically to exclude them). Hence, Article 1001(5) is “inclusive”.

By contrast, Article 1108(7)(a) is a “carve-out” rule. Its function is to exclude all
procurement activities from the scope of some of the obligations of Chapter 11.

In the absence of a reference to Article 1108(7)(a) in Article 1001(5), it does not appear
correct to import the limitations of Article 1001(5) into Article 1108(7)(a), given that these
provisions serve very different purposes.

The Claimant points out that the tribunals in ADF and UPS referred to Article 1001(5) in
their interpretation of Article 1108(7)(a). While this is true, the Tribunal notes that Article
1001(5) itself contains two parts. First, the chapeau provides an inclusive definition of
procurement (“procurement includes procurement by such methods as purchase, lease
or rental, with or without an option to buy”). Notably, it does not limit the meaning of
procurement by requiring that procurement be for governmental use or otherwise. Then,
sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) describe the activities that fall outside the scope of Chapter
10’s obligations. In determining the ordinary meaning of procurement, the tribunal in ADF
relied on the chapeau of Article 1001(5) and not on the limitations of sub-paragraphs (a)
and (b) of that provision. Neither the ADF tribunal nor the UPS tribunal imported the sub-
paragraphs of Article 1001(5) into Article 1108(7)(a) as a means of limiting the ordinary
meaning of “procurement.”

166 Article 1108(5) (“Articles 1102 and 1103 do not apply to any measure that is an exception to, or
derogation from, the obligations under Article 1703 (Intellectual Property National Treatment) as
specifically provided for in that Article.”).

98

430. In any event, despite their reference to Article 1001(5), on the facts, neither the ADF nor
the UPS tribunal found that sole use by the government itself — which is a requirement
in Article 1001(5) (“procurement does not include [...] government provision of goods
and services to persons”) — is an implicit requirement in Article 1108(7)(a). In ADF —
which the Claimant itself recognises as concerning activity “in the proper nature of
procurement’'®” — the procurement related to a highway interchange, which was
obviously not for the government's (sole) use. In UPS, the services in question were
ultimately for the benefit of the persons or companies importing goods by mail rather
than for the government.'® For all these reasons, the Tribunal cannot support the
Claimant’s arguments on Article 1001(5). The Non-Disputing Parties appear to concur
with the Tribunal’s conclusions. ‘©

43

. The Claimant next argues that procurement is a term of art. The Tribunal should
therefore refer to the meaning of procurement in international economic law, such as in
Article III:8(a) of the GATT and Article 1:2 of the GPA to conclude that procurement in
Article 1108(7)(a) cannot refer to procurement of products that are not for governmental
use. Here too the Tribunal disagrees.

432. Article III:8(a) of the GATT provides as follows:

“The provisions in this Article shall not apply to laws, regulations or
requirements governing the procurement by governmental agencies of
products purchased for governmental purposes and not with a view to
commercial resale or with a view to use in the production of goods for
commercial resale.”

433. Accordingly, Article IIl:8(a) of the GATT contains the term “procurement.” However,
unlike in Article 1108(7)(a) where the term is unqualified, in Article III:8(a) the term is
qualified.'”° As noted above, if the NAFTA Parties had wished to introduce the additional

167 Reply §248.

168 UPS §132.

169 Mexico's First Article 1128 Submission §8 (“Mexico observes that the ordinary meaning of the term
‘procurement’ in Article 1108 is broad and should not be limited by Article 1001.5. The description of
‘procurement’ in [A]rticle 1001.5 is applicable for purposes of Chapter Ten as it is included in the
provision that sets out the ‘scope and coverage’ of [C]hapter Ten. It does not apply to Chapter Eleven.”);
U.S. First Article1128 Submission §17 (“The United States agrees with Canada that, whereas in
Chapter Eleven the term is used as a broad ‘carve-out’, in Chapter Ten the term is used as a ‘carve-
in”).

170 The Appellate Body noted that Article III:8(a) contains several elements: (i) “laws, regulations or
requirements governing the procurement by governmental agencies”; (ii) the procurement of “products”;
(iii) “purchased for governmental purposes’; and (iv) products purchased “not for a commercial resale”
(Appellate Body Report §§5.57-5.58). None of these elements are present in Article 1108(7)(a) of the

99

434.

435.

436.

437.

limitations of Article III:8(a) of the GATT into Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA, they could
have done so. Indeed, they did do so in Article 1504(2), which replicates the language
found in Article II:8(a) of the GATT. But they did not do so here in respect of Article
1108(7)(a), which leads the Tribunal to conclude that Article III:8(a) of the GATT should
not be used to interpret Article 1108(7)(a).

Article1:2 of the GPA speaks of procurement in the following terms:

“This Agreement applies to procurement by any contractual means,
including through such methods as purchase or as lease, rental or hire
purchase, with or without an option to buy, including any combination of
products and services.”

The Tribunal notes that in its General Notes to Appendix | of the GPA (“Canada’s
Notes”), Canada defines procurement as “contractual transactions to acquire property
or services for the direct benefit or use of the government.” If — as the Claimant suggests
— the ordinary meaning of “procurement” implied government use, there would have
been no reason to specify this in Canada’s Notes. The fact that Canada had to
specifically limit procurement to government use speaks against the Claimant's
arguments that procurement is a term of art implying governmental use.

The understanding that procurement does not ordinarily imply government use was also
confirmed by the WTO Panel in the following terms:

“[A]rgument that ‘procurement’ implies ‘governmental use, benefit, or
consumption’ does not sit well with the immediate context within which the
term ‘procurement’ is used in Article Ill:8(a) of the GATT 1994. [...] The
notion of governmental use, benefit or consumption is not immediately
apparent from the ordinary meanings of these terms.”11

 

Further still, if (as the Tribunal has concluded above) the object and purpose of the carve-
out in Article 1108(7)(a) is to permit the NAFTA Contracting Parties to purchase goods
or services in a manner that yields maximum benefits for the local economy, it would

NAFTA. See also Mexico's First Article 1128 Submission §10 (“There are important differences in the
language used in GATT Article III:8(a) and NAFTA Article 1108. GATT Article IIl:8 (a) makes reference

 

 

to procurement ‘by g ies of products purchased for go purposes and not
with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the production of goods for sale’

 

(emphasis added). This language is not present in Article 1108, which only makes reference to
‘procurement by a Party or a state enterprise’.”).

171 Panel Report §7.131.

100

438.

439.

make no difference at all whether such goods or services, once purchased, are used
solely by the Government, or by any other entity.

Once again, this is so even if one places special emphasis on the words in Article
1108(7) and (8): “procurement by a Party or a state enterprise.”

The Claimant further submits that if the meaning of “procurement” in Chapter 11 is
inconsistent with the meaning of “procurement” in Chapter 10, then the Chapter 10
meaning should prevail. The Tribunal does not find an inconsistency between the
meaning of “procurement” in Article 1108(7)(a) and the chapeau of Article 1001(5).
Indeed, for the reasons mentioned above, this Tribunal (like the tribunals in ADF and
UPS) has found that the chapeau of Article 1001(5) informs the meaning of
“procurement” in Article 1108(7)(a). In addition, subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Article
1001(5) are not found in Article 1108(7)(a), and therefore, the question of inconsistency
cannot arise. What the Claimant is seeking is not a finding of inconsistency between
Articles 1001(5) and 1108(7)(a) but rather an importation of the limitations in paragraphs
(a) and (b) of Article 1001(5) into Article 1108(7)(a), for which there is no justification, as
has already been expounded above.

(iv) Nature of the FIT Program

440. Having thus set the contours of procurement in Article 1108(7)(a), and having refuted

44

the Claimant's related arguments, the Tribunal now proceeds to examine whether the
FIT Program constitutes “procurement.”

. The Tribunal recalls that in 2009 the Government of Ontario enacted the GEGEA “to
build a green economy.” As Ms. Lo (the then Assistant Deputy Minister of the
Renewables and Energy Efficiency Division at the Ministry of Energy) testified, the
GEGEA sought to address a number of policy objectives, including promoting clean
energy, attracting investment, creating jobs in renewable energy, and providing support
for aboriginal and rural communities. In line with these objectives, it authorized the
Minister of Energy to direct the OPA to establish a FIT Program, '”? which was described
as a procurement program:

172 The power to issue directions enabled the Minister of Energy to direct the OPA in various areas
including “procurement solicitation” relating to the “procurement of electricity supply”, administrative
matters and the establishment and administration of the FIT Program.

that is designed to procure energy from renewable energy sources under
such circumstances and conditions, in consideration of such factors and
within such period as the Minister may require.

(4) In this section, ‘feed-in tariff program’ means a program for
procurement, including a procurement process, providing standard
program rules, standard contracts and standard pricing regarding classes
of generation facilities differentiated by energy source or fuel type,
generator capacity and the manner by which the generation facility is used,
deployed, installed or located.”

On 24 September 2009, the Minister issued the formal direction to the OPA to establish
the FIT Program “to procure energy from a wide range of renewable energy sources.”
The Program was a “key element” for purposes of meeting the objectives of the GEGEA
and it was “critical to Ontario’s success in becoming a leading renewable energy
jurisdiction.” It was to “introduce a simpler method to procure and develop generating
capacity from renewable sources of energy”, reduce emissions, “enable new green
industries through new investment and job creation” and “provide incentives for
investment in renewable energy technologies”. The direction instructed the OPA to enter
into FIT Contracts, prescribed the methodology and process for establishing prices, the
duration of FIT Contracts, restrictions on the land on which electricity production facilities
could be built, and rules governing reporting and review.

As Ms. Lo and Mr. Duffy (Manager of Generation Procurement at the OPA) explained, it
was necessary for the Government to step in and to create a specialized procurement
process for renewable energy. By doing so, the Government not only attracted investors
by somewhat mitigating the commercial risks associated with developing renewable
energy, but also ensured that Ontario’s renewable energy development would be
sufficiently robust to meet its future energy needs. '”°

The FIT Program was then put into operation through the FIT Rules, which were the
result of numerous consultations with stakeholders.’ The FIT Rules required
generators to enter into FIT Contracts with the OPA. They also specified the form of such
contracts.

The OPA's power to enter into such contracts was set out in section 25.35(4) of the
amended Electricity Act of 1998, allowing it to conclude “contracts relating to the
procurement of electricity supply and capacity using alternative energy sources or
renewable energy sources to assist the Government of Ontario in achieving goals in the
development and use of alternative or renewable energy technology and resources.”"”°
When assessing bids and granting FIT Contracts, the OPA was governed by the Ontario
Power Authority Procurement Process Regulations. '”°

The FIT Contract described the contractual relationship between the OPA and the
electricity generators. It included a cover page setting out the essentials of the project,
general terms and conditions, annexes addressing various matters relating to each
project, and an appendix setting out standard definitions. Essentially, the FIT Contract
contained a detailed framework pursuant to which a generator provided renewable
energy electricity and, in exchange, received a guaranteed price for 20 years.

Consistent with its practice in other procurement programs, the OPA employed a
“fairness monitor” to verify the fairness and transparency of the implementation of the
FIT Program.‘7”

On the basis of this description, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the FIT
Program constitutes “procurement.” By way of the FIT Program, the Government of
Ontario purchases electricity through the OPA for the use of and for the ultimate benefit
of the people of Ontario. The FIT Program bears all the hallmarks of procurement that
have been described above. It was introduced to create a green economy and stimulate
job creation. It was designed following extensive consultations with stakeholders, and
launched by formal announcements of the Government. Applicants to the Program were
rigorously screened through prescribed (and publicized) criteria in a competitive, open
process to which any interested person could apply.

The Tribunal’s assessment of the FIT Program as “procurement” is corroborated by the
conclusions of the WTO Panel and Appellate Body. The Claimant itself submits that

175 This authority is repeated in Section 25.35(1)(a) of the Act (Exh. C-0401). Section 25.20(3) confirms
the OPA’s power to enter into “contracts relating to the procurement of electricity.”

these conclusions are “highly relevant”'”® and that this Tribunal can rely upon the Panel
and Appellate Body's findings of fact about the FIT Program. ‘7°

450. The Panel — before whom considerable evidence on the FIT Program was placed and
which, therefore, reviewed the Program in great detail — reached the same finding as
this Tribunal, namely that the FIT Program constitutes “procurement.” However, because
it also found that the procurement was undertaken “with a view to commercial resale”, it
held that the FIT Program was not covered by the terms of Article III:8(a).

451.

On its part, the Appellate Body did not explicitly comment on whether the FIT Program
constituted “procurement” under Article III:8(a) of the GATT, but it too spoke of

“procurement” of electricity by Ontario. °°

452. The Claimant submits that through the FIT Program, the Government does not actually
use its ability to procure because “the electricity is not paid for [...] by government [but]
by consumers” with the OPA acting as a financial conduit, transferring funds to the
generators. ®' The Tribunal cannot follow this argument. Under the FIT Rules, the OPA
is purchasing electricity.'** Under the FIT Contract too, the OPA purchases “Electricity
and Future Contract Related Products” from the generator. '®’ Further, the funds for each
OPA purchase of electricity will inevitably be derived from public sources (i.e.
consumers). But whether such funds are first collected from consumers and then utilized,
or utilized by requiring consumers to pay generators directly, can make no difference.

453. Further still, after a thorough review of the FIT Program, both the Panel and the Appellate
Body concluded that the FIT Program involved the purchase of electricity. '®4 In fact, the

Appellate Body specifically observed that the FIT Program involved the “government
purchase of goods” rather than a “transfer of funds.”"®>

It may be noted that the tribunal in UPS dismissed the argument that the fee in question
had to be paid in accordance with a specific formula or in a particular manner and
concluded that a service had been procured despite the fact that the service was paid
by the persons importing goods rather than by the government. 1

Another argument advanced by the Claimant is that the FIT Program cannot constitute
procurement because the OPA “does not take any form of possession over electricity
supplied by FIT generators, including legal title.”"®’ Here again, the Tribunal cannot
accept this submission. First, unlike other goods, electricity, once generated, must be
simultaneously transmitted and consumed. It cannot be stored in a warehouse or
elsewhere.'®° The notion of “possession” is not therefore an obvious criterion here.
Indeed, in this context, the Tribunal notes that the procurement exception in Article
1108(7)(a) applies to the procurement of both “goods” and “services.” If possession were
an indispensable characteristic of procurement, this would mean that Article 1108(7)(a)
would never apply to the procurement of services, because services are incapable of
being possessed. The Claimant's interpretation would therefore render Article
1108(7)(a) unworkable in respect of the procurement of services, a result that would be
prohibited by treaty interpretation rules. The Tribunal thus rejects the Claimant's
argument that possession is a necessary attribute of procurement in the context of Article
1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA.

Finally, both the WTO Panel and Appellate Body observed that Ontario does in fact take
a form of possession over the electricity generated. Or, in the words of the Panel:

“[t]he fact that Hydro One owns and operates 97% of the transmission lines
combined with the fact that it distributes electricity to 1.3 million customers,
strongly suggests that the Government of Ontario purchases the electricity
that is delivered into the grid under the FIT Programme. In this regard, it is
also important to recall that while the IESO (another ‘agent’ of the
Government of Ontario) has stated that it does not take any ‘title’ to the
electricity in the Ontario power grid, it nevertheless controls how electricity
flows through that grid. Thus, the Government of Ontario not only contracts

459.

with FIT Programme generators through the OPA to supply electricity into
the grid, but it also directs the movement of that electricity to and
throughout that grid by means of IESO instructions, and then finally,
through the operations of Hydro One, transmits and distributes the
delivered electricity to end-user customers. In our view, the combined
actions of all three ‘public bodies’ (but especially Hydro One and the OPA)
demonstrate that the Government of Ontario purchases electricity within
the meaning of Article 1.1(a)(1)(iii) of the SCM Agreement.”"89

On its part, the Appellate Body also held that:

“[t]he Government of Ontario takes possession over electricity and
therefore purchases electricity.” °°

Thus, even if possession was a necessary requirement of procurement generally (on
which the Tribunal expresses no opinion at present), and even if possession was a
necessary requirement under Article 1108(7)(a) of NAFTA (which the Tribunal rejects),
that requirement would be satisfied in the present case.

The final submission put forward by the Claimant is that Canada cannot rely on the
procurement exception since it has not demonstrated that there is a “nexus” between
the FIT Contract and the measures challenged by the Claimant under Articles 1102 and
1103 of the NAFTA.'%' The Tribunal does not accept this submission. First, the
Claimant’s view appears to arise from arguments put before the WTO Panel and
Appellate Body in the context of Article III:8(a) of the GATT, which, as mentioned earlier,
is of limited use in the present analysis. There, the finding of a nexus between the good
being procured and the good subject to domestic content was fundamental. The
existence of a nexus is irrelevant here, because Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA is
broader than Article III:8(a) of the GATT. Once it is established that there has been
“procurement” by a Party or state enterprise, Article 1108(7)(a) excludes all claims of
NT, MFN and domestic content in connection with such procurement. Second, and in
any event, as was already seen above (§254), the claims submitted to this Tribunal
principally involve the acts of the Government and the OPA in relation to the FIT
Program. In respect of Articles 1102 and 1103 of the NAFTA, the Claimant argues that
Canada treated the Claimant and its investments (all of which were in the context of the

189 Panel Report §7.239.

199 Appellate Body Report §§5.127-5.128.

191 This argument appears principally in the context of the Claimant's Article 1106 claim (Reply §§204-
205, 265), which, for the reasons mentioned above, has been rejected on jurisdictional grounds. As a
result, it need not be considered further. However, to the extent the argument also relates to the Articles
1102 and 1103 claims, it is examined here.

464.

FIT Program) less favorably than other investors in like circumstances. Thus, there is a
direct nexus between the claims in this arbitration and the FIT Program. As a result, even
if a nexus requirement similar to Article IIl:8(a) of the GATT existed in the context of
Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA, it would be satisfied.

In sum, the Tribunal concludes that the FIT Program constitutes a “procurement” within
the meaning of Article 1108(7)(a).

Having reached this conclusion, it remains for the Tribunal to address whether the FIT
Program is a procurement program “by a Party or a state enterprise.”

c. The FIT Program is a procurement program “by a Party or a state
enterprise”

The exception in Article 1108(7)(a) only applies if the procurement is by a “Party” or a
“state enterprise.” The Claimant argues that the FIT Program is not procurement by a
Party or state enterprise because it is a provincial measure and Article 1001(1)(a) of the
NAFTA “excludes” procurement by state and local governments. The Tribunal does not
share this view. Indeed, the Claimant once again seeks to import into Article 1108(7)(a)
limitations not found in that provision. For the reasons elaborated above, this approach
is ill-founded. Article 1108(7)(a) does not include or otherwise refer to the limitations
found in Article 1001(1)(a), and the Tribunal sees no reason to incorporate such
limitations contained in Chapter 10 into Article 1108(7)(a) of Chapter 11.

The term “Party” is not defined in the NAFTA. However, as the obligations in Chapter 11
apply to both federal and provincial governments, it is coherent that exceptions to these
obligations also apply to federal and provincial governments. Or, in the words of the ADF
tribunal: “the exclusionary effect of Article 1108(7)(a) and 8(b) operates on both federal
and state governmental procurement.”'%? Applied to this case, this means that
procurement through the FIT Program by the provincial Government of Ontario is to be
considered as “procurement by a Party” for the purposes of Article 1108(7)(a) of the
NAFTA.

Moreover, the Tribunal has already held earlier that the OPA is a state enterprise (§355).

182 ADF §170.

107

465

466.

467

468

. In summary, the Tribunal holds that the FIT Program constitutes procurement by the
Government of Ontario under Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA. The Program is
implemented by the Government through the OPA, which is a state enterprise.
Consequently, the acts of the Government of Ontario cannot be challenged under
Articles 1102 or 1103 of the NAFTA. The claims in respect of these provisions are,
therefore, dismissed. As a result of this finding, the Tribunal can dispense with enquiring
into the Respondent's Subsidy Defense, which would only have been relevant in the
absence of procurement.

As it held above, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the domestic content claims (§335).
It will thus refrain from discussing whether such claims would be excluded by the
operation of Article 1108(8)(b) of the NAFTA, but to mention, for the sake of
completeness, that its findings on Article 1108(7)(a) would equally apply to Article
1108(8)(b). Indeed, the Tribunal considers that the term “procurement” has the same
meaning in Articles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b), and notes that none of the Parties (or
Non-Disputing Parties) has argued to the contrary. Thus, even if the Tribunal had
jurisdiction over the domestic content claims (quod non), the latter would in any event
not survive on the merits.

D. ARTICLE 1105(1)

. It follows from the foregoing analysis that only the Claimant's Article 1105(1) (referred to
below as “Article 1105”) claims remain to be resolved. The Tribunal will start by setting
forth the principles governing the interpretation of Article 1105 of the NAFTA (1. below).
It will then examine the scope and content of Article 1105 and address the Claimant's
argument that Canada is bound to provide it with the allegedly more favorable treatment
found in certain of Canada’s other investment treaties (2. below). Finally, the Tribunal
will determine whether the impugned acts of Canada violate Article 1105 (3. below).

1. Interpretation of Article 1105
a. The Claimant’s Position
. The Claimant acknowledges that on 31 July 2001, the NAFTA Free Trade Commission
issued the FTC Note, which addressed (inter alia) Article 1105. However, it argues that

the FTC Note is not the exclusive source of interpretation for Article 1105: “the Tribunal
should consider itself at liberty to interpret the meaning of ‘fair and equitable treatment’

108

469.

470.

47

as contained in NAFTA Article 1105 as an autonomous standard in accordance with all
the normal and well-accepted sources of international law — not just customary
international law.”"®? Further, the Claimant argues that the FTC Note is not a bona fide
interpretation of Article 1105 and amounts to an amendment of the NAFTA with the result
that the FTC Note “has no legal force or effect." Should the Tribunal consider itself
bound by the FTC Note, the Claimant stresses that such instrument itself states that it is
merely one of the sources of interpretation of the customary international law standard
of treatment. "°°

b. The Respondent’s Position

By contrast, the Respondent considers that the FTC Note constitutes the only source of
interpretation for Article 1105. According to it, had the NAFTA Parties intended that
Article 1105 be interpreted in accordance with the customary international law rules of
treaty interpretation, they would not have issued the FTC Note. The fact that they did
issue the note “leaves no space for the application of the customary international law
rules of treaty interpretation.”1%°

The Respondent further opposes the Claimant's argument that the FTC Note is not
binding on the Tribunal. It points to the wording of Article 1131(2), from which it is clear
that the Tribunal cannot question the validity of the FTC Note. Moreover, it submits that
the FTC Note would bind the Tribunal even in the absence of Article 1131(2), as it merely
emphasizes that Article 1105 prescribes the customary international law minimum
standard of treatment of aliens, an interpretation that the NAFTA Parties have always
given to Article 1105.19”

. The Respondent also disputes the Claimant's position that the FTC Note itself requires

Article 1105 to be interpreted in accordance with the rules of customary international law
on treaty interpretation. If the Claimant's argument were correct, “it would lead to the
absurd result that Article 1131(2) would require the Tribunal to apply only the FTC Note
and not the customary international law rules of interpretation, only to then have the FTC

Note require the Tribunal to apply the customary international law rules of

interpretation.”1°

472. Finally, the Respondent notes that similar arguments were made by the claimant in the

recent Bilcon case and that they were all rejected.
c. Non-Disputing Parties’ Position

473. Mexico agrees with Canada’s submission that the Bilcon tribunal correctly dismissed
similar arguments with respect to the FTC Note.‘

474. The United States also agrees with the conclusions reached in Bilcon about the binding
nature of the FTC Note. It is equally of the opinion that Chapter 11 tribunals may not turn
to sources of international law beyond customary international law when interpreting and
applying Article 1105.

d. Analysis

475. Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA reads as follows:

“Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party
treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable
treatment and full protection and security.”

476. The FTC Note states in relevant part the following:

“2. Minimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with International Law.
1.Article 1105 prescribes the customary international law minimum
standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to
be afforded to investments of investors of another Party.

2.The concepts of ‘fair and equitable treatment’ and ‘full protection and
security’ do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is
required by the customary international law minimum standard of
treatment of aliens.

478.

479.

3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of
the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish
that there has been a breach of Article 1105.” 2°

The Claimant contends that the Tribunal is not limited by the FTC Note and may consider
sources of law other than customary international law. The Tribunal finds it difficult to
follow this view. Indeed, if the NAFTA Parties wished a Chapter 11 tribunal to interpret
Article 1105 in accordance with the usual rules of treaty interpretation, there would have
been no need for the FTC Note. The fact that the NAFTA Parties issued the FTC Note
establishes that the NAFTA Parties intended Chapter 11 tribunals to interpret Article
1105 in the manner prescribed in the FTC Note itself. If one were to follow the Claimant's
argument, the FTC Note would be inutile, which cannot be correct.

The Claimant further asserts that the FTC Note does not bind the Tribunal. Here too, the
Tribunal cannot accept this position. Article 1131 of the NAFTA, which deals with the
governing law, provides the contrary in no uncertain terms:

"2. An interpretation by the Commission of a provision of this Agreement
shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section."

Thus, pursuant to Article 1131(2), an interpretation issued by the Free Trade
Commission under the NAFTA, such as the FTC Note, is binding on all Chapter 11
tribunals. It is not for this Tribunal to determine whether — as the Claimant alleges — the
FTC Note amounts to an amendment of the NAFTA or not. Rather, faced with an
interpretation given by the Contracting States through the FTC, the Tribunal must simply
apply it. This approach has been followed by several NAFTA tribunals.”°' For instance,
the tribunal in ADF observed:

“Nothing in NAFTA suggests that a Chapter 11 tribunal may determine for
itself whether a document submitted to it as an interpretation by the Parties
acting through the FTC is in fact an ‘amendment’ which presumably may
be disregarded until ratified by all the Parties under their respective
internal law.”202

111

480. More recently, the tribunal in Bilcon also held that the FTC Note constituted an “authentic

481.

482.

interpretation” of the NAFTA, which it not only had to take into account under Article
31(3) VCLT, but which was binding upon it:

“Article 31(3)(a) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties calls on
treaty interpreters to take into account ‘any subsequent agreement
between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the
application of its provisions’. Yet NAFTA Article 1131(2) contains a lex
specialis, which goes further in providing that ‘[a]n interpretation by the
Commission of a provision of this Agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal
established under this Section’. Under the general rule on interpretation
set out in the Vienna Convention, a NAFTA tribunal would only need to
‘take into account’ the subsequent agreement. However, by virtue of
NAFTA Article 1131(2), acts of authentic interpretation by the States
parties to the Agreement, like the Notes just referred to, are binding and
conclusive.”

The Claimant also argues that the FTC Note itself calls for the Tribunal to apply the
customary international law rules of treaty interpretation while interpreting Article 1105.
In the Tribunal’s opinion, this does not appear correct. The FTC Note does not contain
rules for the interpretation of Article 1105. It actually interprets that provision by
specifying its meaning according to which the standard of treatment in Article 1105 is

identical to the minimum customary international law standard of treatment of aliens.

Finally, the Claimant argues that, in determining the content of Article 1105, the Tribunal
may refer to the sources of international law enumerated in Article 38 of the Statute of
the International Court of Justice (the “ICJ Statute”), namely international conventions,
international customs, general principles of law, judicial decisions and scholarly writings.
Again, the FTC Note, which this Tribunal — like other tribunals before it — considers
binding on it, requires the Tribunal to refer to customary international law, and not to
other sources of international law. This is clear from the FTC Note itself and from case

law in application of the Note.?° This said, while it cannot refer to other sources of

international law, the Tribunal may certainly be guided by the decisions of other NAFTA
Chapter 11 tribunals applying Article 1105 and the FTC Note.2°5

Having established that Article 1105 must be interpreted in accordance with the FTC.
Note, which is binding upon it, the Tribunal will now proceed to determine the scope and
content of Article 1105.

2. Scope and Content of Article 1105

a. The Claimant’s Position

. In the Claimant's view, Article 1105 obliges the Respondent to provide investments of
foreign investors treatment that accords with the rules and principles established by the
four sources of international law as enumerated in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute.?° It
submits that the standard set out in Article 1105 at least includes a requirement that
Canada follow customary international law.”°” For Mesa, Article 1105 consists of several
components including the duty to act in good faith; fairness and reasonableness;
treatment free from arbitrary conduct; transparency; protection against abuse of rights;
procedural fairness; legitimate expectations; treatment free from political motivation; and
treatment free from discriminatory conduct. Further, the Claimant contends that the “full
protection and security” requirement in Article 1105 “requires a host country to exercise
reasonable care to protect investments against injury by private parties.”2°

The Claimant further submits that the minimum standard of treatment under customary
international law has evolved and now converges with the fair and equitable treatment
(“FET”) standard found in modern investment treaties that do not refer to the customary
international law standard (to which the Tribunal will refer as “unqualified FET
clauses’). In effect, the Claimant submits that there are no material differences between
the content of Article 1105 and that of unqualified FET provisions in other treaties.

205 Bilcon §441 (“According to the FTC Notes, NAFTA tribunals are bound to interpret and apply the

stan
stan

dard in accordance with customary international law. In interpreting the international minimum
dard, the Tribunal also drew guidance from earlier NAFTA Chapter Eleven decisions.”).

207 Mem. §336.
208 Mem. §413.

113

486.

487.

488.

489.

In response to Canada’s objection that the Claimant must establish state practice and
opinio juris to substantiate the evolution of the minimum standard of treatment under
customary international law, the Claimant states that “the content of customary
international law can be sourced through international tribunal decisions, and that it is

not necessary to specifically prove the elements of state practice and opinio juris.”2°°

Finally, the Claimant submits that “if a MFN clause in another treaty obliged Canada to
provide treatment to investments of foreign investors that would be advantageous or
surpassing the quality of that provided to investments under NAFTA Article 1105, then
more favorable treatment would need to be provided by Canada [to the Claimant].”2"°

b. The Respondent’s Position

For its part, the Respondent refutes the argument that Article 1105 creates an open-
ended obligation to be defined by tribunals. It sets an objective standard of treatment, or
in Canada’s words, it “prescribes no more and no less than the customary international
law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.”*'' According to the Respondent, the
threshold for demonstrating a violation of Article 1105 is high. To breach Article 1105,
the impugned state conduct must be “sufficiently egregious and shocking, such as a
complete lack of due process, evident discrimination or a manifest lack of reasons.”?'2

The Respondent rejects the assertion that the autonomous standard of fair and equitable
treatment and the international law minimum standard of treatment in Article 1105 have
converged. Since the Claimant invokes a rule of customary international law under which
the minimum standard equals FET, it has the burden of proving the existence of such a
rule. And in this regard, it is for the Claimant to establish state practice and opinio juris.
It must also prove that the Respondent has breached the customary rule. The Claimant
has failed to discharge this burden. In fact, the Claimant has failed to cite a single award
interpreting the customary international law minimum standard in a manner supporting
its position.

494.

Finally, the Respondent opposes the use of the MFN provision to import standards found
in other treaties. According to it, the FTC Note requires the Tribunal to interpret Article
1105 as providing for the customary international law standard and nothing else.
Provisions of other treaties as well as other clauses in the NAFTA, including the MFN
clause, are thus irrelevant.?"? In any event, for the Respondent, even if one were to look
to its other treaties, the Claimant has not proven that any of those treaties provides for
treatment more favorable than the minimum standard of Article 1105.

c. The Non-Disputing Parties’ Position

It is the United States’ submission that the FTC Note confirms the NAFTA Parties’
express intent to establish the minimum standard of customary international law as the
applicable standard for purposes of Article 1105. According to it, “the minimum standard
of treatment is an umbrella concept reflecting a set of rules that, over time, has
crystallized into customary international law in specific contexts”, with the result that
Article 1105 “reflects a standard that develops from State practice and opinio juris, rather
than an autonomous, treaty-based standard.”

It further submits that the burden is on the Claimant to establish the existence,
applicability, and violation of a relevant obligation under customary international law.
This burden cannot be discharged by relying on arbitral decisions as these decisions do
not constitute evidence of state practice and opinio juris.

Finally, it notes that a finding of a breach of Article 1105 “must be made in the light of
the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of
domestic authorities to regulate matters within their borders.”2">

In its submission, Mexico contends that the threshold for a breach of Article 1105 is high.
It concurs with the United States and Canada that the burden is on the Claimant to
establish an obligation under customary international law based on state practice and
opinio juris. \t is also common ground among Mexico and the other NAFTA Parties that
decisions of arbitral tribunals are not themselves a source of customary international
law.

d. Analysis

The Parties diverge on the content of the customary international law minimum standard
of treatment found in Article 1105. Mesa submits that such standard has evolved and
now has the same content and meaning as the so-called “autonomous” FET standard of
modern BITs, while the Respondent holds the contrary view.

An analysis of the content of the customary international law minimum standard of
treatment usually starts with a reference to the U.S.-Mexico Claims Commission's
decision in Neer. There the Claims Commission defined the standard in the following
terms:

“[T]he treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international
delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect
of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of
international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would
readily recognize its insufficiency.”2"°

A number of Chapter 11 tribunals have since set out the content of the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment in Article 1105. Broadly, two lines of
decisions can be discerned: decisions questioning the relevance and applicability of the
Neer standard, and decisions applying it with a number of important qualifications.

Tribunals following the first approach?” emphasize that Neer did not deal with
investment protection, but concerned Mexico’s alleged failure to carry out an effective
investigation of the killing of a US citizen by armed men who were not even alleged to
be acting under Mexico’s control or direction. According to the Mondev tribunal, due to
this dissimilarity in circumstances, “there is insufficient cause for assuming that
provisions of bilateral investment treaties, and of NAFTA [...] are confined to the Neer
standard of outrageous treatment [...]."2'° Similarly, for the ADF tribunal “there
appeared] no logical necessity and no concordant state practice to support the view that

216 Exh. CL-141, L.F.H. Neer and Pauline E. Neer (United States) v. Mexico, UNRIAA Award, 15
October 1926, Vol. 4, pp. 61-62, §4.

§132.

218 Mondev §115.

116

the Neer formulation is automatically extendible to the contemporary context of foreign
investors and their investments by a host or recipient State.”*'° More recently, the Bilcon
tribunal noted that the NAFTA protection was not restricted to the Neer requirement of
outrageous conduct:

“NAFTA awards make it clear that the international minimum standard is
not limited to conduct by host states that is outrageous. The contemporary
minimum international standard involves a more significant measure of
protection.”27°

499. Tribunals adopting the second approach apply the stringent requirements of Neer for
purposes of breaches of Article 1105.22 However, even under this approach, they
consider that the principles of customary international law are not understood to be
“frozen in amber at the time of the Neer decision.”*22 They observe that the Neer test of
severity is easier to satisfy now than it was at the time of the Neer decision. Canada itself
does not rely on the Neer decision; it rather invokes the articulation of the minimum
standard as it was set out in Glamis,?*° Cargill?#4 and Mobil.22°

500. In practice, these two approaches have much in common. Most importantly, they both
accept that the minimum standard of treatment is an evolutionary notion,2° which offers
greater protection to investors than that contemplated in the Neer decision.

501. Having considered the Parties’ positions and the authorities cited by them, the Tribunal
is of the opinion that the decision in Waste Management I! correctly identifies the content
of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment found in Article 1105.

Bilcon §§435-438. See also Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Interpretive Powers of the Free Trade
Commission, Fifteen Years of NAFTA Chapter 11 Arbitration 175, 184 (2011) (“Essentially, most
tribunals have considered that the minimum standard of treatment is an evolutionary notion, which
applies as it stands today and not at the time of the Neer decision in 1926 — requiring outrageous
conduct.”).

117

This decision was cited with approval in the Claimant's submissions.”2’ It was also
quoted in the recent Bilcon decision,” with which the Claimant agrees,”*° in the
following terms:

“The formulation of the ‘general standard for Article 1105’ by the Waste
Management Tribunal is particularly influential, and a number of other
tribunals have applied its formulation of the international minimum standard
based on its reading of NAFTA authorities:

‘(T]he minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable
treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and
harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair,
unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant
to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process
leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety — as might
be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial
proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an
administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that
the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host
State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.

Evidently the standard is to some extent a flexible one which must
be adapted to the circumstances of each case.’

443. While no single arbitral formulation can definitively and exhaustively
capture the meaning of Article 1105, the Tribunal finds this quote from Waste
Management to be a particularly apt one. Acts or omissions constituting a
breach must be of a serious nature. The Waste Management formulation
applies intensifying adjectives to certain items—but by no means all of
them—in its list of categories of potentially nonconforming conduct. The
formulation includes ‘grossly’ unfair, ‘manifest’ failure of natural justice and
‘complete’ lack of transparency.

444. The list conveys that there is a high threshold for the conduct of a host
state to rise to the level of a NAFTA Article 1105 breach, but that there is no
requirement in all cases that the challenged conduct reaches the level of
shocking or outrageous behaviour. The formulation also recognises the
requirement for tribunals to be sensitive to the facts of each case, the
potential relevance of reasonably relied-on representations by a host state,
and a recognition that injustice in either procedures or outcomes can
constitute a breach.”29°

227 Mem. §361.

228 The decision was also quoted in the cases relied on by the Respondent. See Mobil §141; Cargill
§283.

228 See Claimant's Submissions on Bilcon §§46-50 (setting out the Bilcon tribunal's decision on Article
1105 and stating that “[i]n this arbitration, the Investor made similar submissions [...] advocating for the
standard ultimately adopted in Bilcon.”).

230 Bilcon §§442-444.

118

502. On this basis, the Tribunal considers that the following components can be said to form
part of Article 1105: arbitrariness; “gross” unfairness; discrimination; “complete” lack of
transparency and candor in an administrative process; lack of due process “leading to
an outcome which offends judicial propriety”; and “manifest failure” of natural justice in
judicial proceedings.”*' Further, the Tribunal shares the view held by a majority of
NAFTA tribunals” that the failure to respect an investor's legitimate expectations in and
of itself does not constitute a breach of Article 1105, but is an element to take into

account when assessing whether other components of the standard are breached.

503. The Tribunal disagrees with the Claimant's submissions that the “autonomous” fair and
equitable treatment provisions in other treaties impose additional requirements on
Canada beyond those deriving from the minimum standard. As was already discussed
above, the FTC Note is clear that the Tribunal must apply the customary international
law standard of the international minimum standard of treatment, and nothing else. There
is thus no scope for autonomous standards to impose additional requirements on the
NAFTA Parties. This was the conclusion in Bilcon as well.?°°

504. The threshold for a breach of Article 1105 is also relevant to the Tribunal’s analysis. The
Claimant does not appear to dispute — and rightly so — that the threshold for Article 1105
is high. Indeed, the three NAFTA Parties concur on this issue” and other Chapter 11
tribunals have come to the same conclusion.2°5

231 In a recent case, while interpreting Article 10.5 of the U.S.-Oman Treaty, which is similar to Article
1105 of the NAFTA, the tribunal described the scope and content of the customary international law
standard of treatment as “a gross or flagrant disregard for the basic principles of fairness, consistency,
even-handedness, due process, or natural justice expected by and of all States under customary
international law. Such a standard requires more than that the Claimant point to some inconsistency or
inadequacy in Oman’s regulation of its internal affairs: a breach of the minimum standard requires a
failure, wilful or otherwise egregious, to protect a foreign investor's basic rights and expectations. It will
certainly not be the case that every minor misapplication of a State’s laws or regulations will meet that
high standard.” See Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v. Sultanate of Oman (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/33),
Award, 3 November 2015, §390.

282 See for instance Waste Management §96; Cargill §296.

233 Bilcon §432 (“In light of the FTC Notes and in the specific context of NAFTA Chapter Eleven in which
this Tribunal operates, ‘fair and equitable treatment’ and ‘full protection and security’ cannot be regarded
as ‘autonomous’ treaty norms that impose additional requirements above and beyond what the
minimum standard requires.”). The Bilcon tribunal referred to the discussion of the “additive approach”
in Pope & Talbot — Award on the Merits of Phase 2 §110 et seq.

234 U.S. Second Article 1128 Submission §20 (“Accordingly, there is a high threshold for Article 1105 to
apply”); Mexico's Second Article 1128 Submission §8 (“[T]he threshold for establishing a breach of the
minimum standard of treatment at customary international law is high.”); Canada’s Observations on the
Bilcon §15; C-Mem. §394-402; Rej. §146.

235 Bilcon §441; Exh. CL-194, International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. United Mexican States
(UNCITRAL), Arbitral Award, 26 January 2006 (“International Thunderbird’), §§194, 197.

119

505. Finally, when defining the content of Article 1105 one should further take into
consideration that international law requires tribunals to give a good level of deference
to the manner in which a state regulates its internal affairs. Or, in the words of the Bilcon
tribunal:

“Even when state officials are acting in good faith there will sometimes be
not only controversial judgments, but clear-cut mistakes in following
procedures, gathering and stating facts and identifying the applicable
substantive rules. State authorities are faced with competing demands on
their administrative resources and there can be delays or limited time,
attention and expertise brought to bear in dealing with issues. The
imprudent exercise of discretion or even outright mistakes do not, as a
rule, lead to a breach of the international minimum standard.”2°°

506. Before the Tribunal proceeds to a review of the acts that allegedly breached Article 1105,
it must address the Claimant’s argument that “[t]he MFN obligation requires this Tribunal
to provide treatment as favorable to the Investor as that provided to other investors who
would receive treaty protection for their investments under other investment protection
treaties negotiated by Canada.”*°’ Mesa thus contends that it can avoid the limitations
of Article 1105 by relying on the MFN provision in Article 1103(1) of the NAFTA and
importing FET clauses from other treaties of Canada. It points to several treaties under
which Canada provides foreign investors with a better “autonomous” level of
protection?** and submits that it is entitled to the same protection.°9

507. The Tribunal rejects the Claimant's submission. Indeed, the Claimant bases its argument
on Article 1103 of the NAFTA. As mentioned above, Article 1108(7)(a) excludes the
application of Article 1103 in cases of procurement. As the FIT Program constitutes
procurement, the Claimant cannot rely on Article 1103 to introduce allegedly more
favorable standards of treatment from other treaties.2°

238 Bilcon §§437, 440. See also SD Myers §263; International Thunderbird §127 (A State “has a wide
discretion with respect to how it carries out such policies by regulation and administrative conduct.”);

240 The ADF tribunal appears to have come to the same conclusion. See ADF §196 (“Assuming, once

better treatment for Albanian and Estonian investors and their investments in the United States, than

3. Canada’s Alleged Breaches of Article 1105

508. In the course of its various submissions, Mesa has argued that numerous acts
contravene Article 1105.41 Indeed, as the Respondent observed, “[t]he Claimant has
alleged that virtually each and every aspect of the conduct of Ontario and the OPA in
the design and implementation of the FIT Program and the GEIA has violated Canada’s
obligations under Article 1105."242

509. For the reasons mentioned above, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over all of the
acts allegedly in breach of Article 1105. Specifically, it lacks jurisdiction over the claim
that Canada breached Article 1105 by entering into the MOU;?*° over the Claimant's
objections to the specific terms of the MOU;“4 and over Mesa’s claims concerning the

initial reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium.745

510. Moreover, some acts which were mentioned in the Claimant's initial submissions did not
appear again, at the hearing or in the post-hearing submissions.*“° While the Claimant
mentioned these and other acts at some stages of the proceedings, it did not rely on
them to raise a specific claim on the ground of Article 1105.74”

the treatment to which the Investor is entitled in the United States under NAFTA Article 1105(1), the
Investor still has not thereby shown violation of Article 1103 by the Respondent. For in any event, the
Respondent is entitled to the defense provided by NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a) which, as noted earlier in
some detail, excludes the application of Article 1103 in a case (like the instant one) involving
governmental procurement by a Party.”).

241 See for instance Mem. §§485, 485(d) (“Canada’s process for awarding Power Purchase
Agreements was unfair, unreasonable and arbitrary toward Mesa”), §§685-686.

242 C-Mem. §381.

243 The Tribunal does have jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims in respect of the GEIA for the TTD
and Arran projects, these are considered below (§542).

244 C-PHB §33 (“[u]nder the MOU, the parties were to conduct a feasibility study and if the feasibility
study supported the deal going forward, then the parties were to enter a conditional agreement [...]
[N]either of these things happened.”).

245 C-PHB §3(c) (“The Korean Consortium did not have to meet any requirements of any kind with
respect to its guaranteed priority access to the first 500 MW of transmission access”). The OPA was
directed to reserve this capacity on 30 September 2009, which is before the Claimant's investment in
November 2009.

248 See for instance NoA §38-42 where the Claimant complains about “Renewable Energy Approval
Changes” and “Waiver of OPA Termination Rights.”

247 For instance, the Claimant submits that “[t]he GEIA also provided the Korean Consortium a higher
price for units of wind energy, by way of an Economic Development Adder. This was not available to
Mesa despite the fact that both of their products — units of wind energy in Ontario’s transmission grid
were identical and indistinguishable” (Reply §122). However, it has not raised an Article 1105 claim on
this ground. Further, the Claimant submits that “Canada ignored the fundamental legal duty and
responsibility of all public servants, who exercise either statutory or discretionary authority, to perform

121

511. As aresult, the Tribunal will focus now on the implementation of the FIT Program by the
OPA (a); the GEIA (b); and the allocation of capacity in the Bruce Region (c). Before
doing so, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that, in reaching the conclusion that Canada
has not breached Article 1105, the Tribunal has reviewed the entire factual matrix
surrounding the Claimant’s investment, and every allegation that has been made at
various times in these proceedings by the Claimant, not all of which are specifically
addressed in this Award.

512. The Tribunal also notes that in various instances the Claimant alleges that Canada’s
conduct was “unfair”, “arbitrary”, “unexpected”, “non-transparent”, “unreasonable”,
“discriminatory” and contrary to the Claimant's legitimate expectations. On the facts of
this case, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to review whether each of these
elements is within the scope of Article 1105. Neither does it appear necessary to set
forth a specific test for each element. The following discussion of the evidence will
demonstrate that the facts required for a finding of breach of Article 1105 have not been
made out and the impugned conduct does not reach the high threshold needed to
establish a violation of Article 1105. Thus, even if all of the components identified by the
Claimant were to form part of Article 1105 (an issue which the Tribunal does not decide),
there would still be no breach of Article 1105.

a. Implementation of the FIT Program by the OPA

513. For the reasons mentioned above (§§350 et. seq.), the following acts of the OPA are to
be considered by the Tribunal:

i. |The OPA’s alleged failure to follow the FIT Rules with respect to the ranking and
evaluation of FIT applications;

ii. | The OPA’s decision not to run the ECT;

ii. | The allegedly better treatment offered by the OPA to other FIT applicants, and
the OPA’s meetings with other FIT applicants which led to benefits not available
to the Claimants being granted to these applicants;

their duties fairly, reasonably, and in good faith [...] Ontario's representatives failed to comply with
[these duties] when carrying out the renewable energy program” (C-PHB §3(d)), again without
articulating a precise Article 1105 claim in this regard.

iv. The release of the FIT Program rankings on 21 December 2010;

v. The OPA’s alleged misadministration of the FIT Program;

vi. | The OPA’s decision on the information to be included in the TAT tables;

vii. | The OPA’s decision to offer NextEra a FIT Contract with connection points on
the 500 kV Bruce to Longwood Line; and,

viii. | The award of the FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011.

. Each of these acts is considered in greater detail below.

(i) Ranking and Evaluation of the Claimant's Launch Period Applications

. The Claimant alleges that it did not receive a FIT Contract because its TTD and Arran
projects were evaluated and ranked in an unfair and arbitrary manner.”“® According to
the Claimant, the ranking was done without a careful review of the FIT Rules and the

actual applications themselves.*“9

The Respondent replies that Mesa’s allegations are baseless. It points to the fact that
LEI, an independent agency, certified that the OPA had carried out a fair and consistent
evaluation of the Launch Period Applications. Moreover, the rankings of the TTD and
Arran projects were appropriate given the poor quality of the information supplied by the
Claimant.25°

As mentioned above, Claimant made two applications in the Launch Period for its TTD
and Arran projects. In each application, the Claimant applied for three criteria points:
Major Equipment Control Point, Prior Experience Point and Financial Capacity Point.
According to the Claimant, it should have been awarded all three of these points, a
position which is opposed by the Respondent. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent

on this issue.

522.

Before reviewing the Claimant’s applications, the Tribunal makes three preliminary
observations, which it will keep in mind while reviewing the merits of Mesa’s claims.

First, it is for the Claimant to establish that its applications were incorrectly ranked. This
is particularly so in the present case where Mesa, as an applicant in the FIT Program,
had the burden of providing the relevant information to the OPA to enable it to evaluate

the applications correctly.

Second, the Claimant presented Mr. Gary Timm as an independent expert “to [confirm]
that the evaluation of Mesa’s launch period investments had been improperly scored by
the Ontario Power Authority.”*5' However, in his expert report, Mr. Timm did not conclude
that the Claimant's applications had been improperly ranked. Further, at the hearing, Mr.
Timm fairly admitted that he had no comments with respect to the OPA's evaluation of
the Major Equipment Control Point,2°? and that he had not concluded that the Claimant
should have been awarded the Prior Experience Point? or the Financial Capacity
Point.264 The Tribunal finds it significant that the Claimant's own expert has not

supported the Claimant's position.

. Third, the Respondent offered the testimony of Mr. Richard Duffy, the then Manager of

Generation Procurement at the OPA and the person responsible for the Launch Period
ranking process at the time. Mr. Duffy submitted two witness statements in the
arbitration, both of which explained in some detail why the Claimant’s applications did
not merit any criteria points. Despite the Respondent's insistence, the Claimant chose
not to examine Mr. Duffy at the hearing. Further, despite having the opportunity to do so
in its submissions, at the hearing, and in its post-hearing brief, the Claimant did not
expressly rebut Mr. Duffy’s evidence on the shortcomings of the Claimant's applications.
His testimony thus remains uncontroverted and the Tribunal sees no reason (nor has

any reason been made out) not to rely on it.

To be awarded the Major Equipment Control Point, the Claimant would have to show

that it had control over a major equipment component.”°> To meet this requirement, the

Claimant submitted a letter from General Electric (“GE”) that stated that both projects
had executed a fixed price contract with GE for the supply wind turbine generators.”°
According to Mr. Duffy's evidence, this was insufficient under the FIT Rules:

“[T]he Claimant did not specify that the turbines complied or would comply
with the domestic content rules of the FIT Program. [...] [E]Jach application
had to contain within the application materials submitted, all the supporting
documentation and required information to support the Claimant's claims.
GE makes turbines that are domestic content compliant and turbines that
are not. There were no grounds for us to simply assume that the turbines
that the Claimant had purchased from GE would meet the requirements of
the FIT Program - especially since in other cases and for other proponents,
GE had been very specific in committing to meet these requirements in a
way that they had not done for the Claimant.”25”

523. The Claimant's applications also contained a statement that its equipment would comply
with the FIT Rules. This statement was equally inadequate, as Mr. Duffy convincingly
explained:

“For the Claimant to assert that merely acknowledging that it would comply
with the FIT Rules should have been sufficient to obtain this point is, in my
view, absurd. This would mean that every applicant that had submitted an
application under the FIT Program would have complied with the
requirements for this criterion point and if that was sufficient to be awarded
this criteria point, there would have been no reason in having the point.”25

524. At the hearing, Mr. Robertson admitted that the Claimant's application for this criteria
point was incomplete:

“Q. And [the FIT Rules] goes on to indicate that: ‘To qualify for the criteria
point, it must be demonstrated that the major equipment component will
have undergone one of the designated activities set out in the applicable
domestic content grid in Exhibit D to the FIT contract.’ [As read] Correct?

A. Okay, | read that, yes.

Q. The letter does not indicate that the turbines will undergo the activities
specified in Exhibit D of the FIT contract; correct?

A. It does not. This was the letter that GE provided to us, based on their
reading of the rules as well.

Q. And Mesa did not supply a copy of the contract they had with GE;
correct?

A. We did not, no.”259

525. To be awarded the Prior Experience Point, the Claimant had to show that it “has, or any
three full-time employees of [the Claimant] each have, successful experience with
planning and developing one or more Similar Facilities." A “Similar Facility” was
defined as “an electricity generation facility, other than the Project, that is located
anywhere in the world”.”°' To qualify as a Similar Facility, a facility needed to meet
certain specific criteria.

526. Inits applications, the Claimant made general statements about its experience in energy
projects. It did not identify any facility which could be regarded as a “Similar Facility”.
Neither did the Claimant's applications name three full-time employees who had
“successful experience with planning and developing one or more Similar Facilities” as
required by the FIT Rules.?62

527. To be awarded the Financial Capacity Point, the Claimant was required to provide
audited financial statements and to show that a “Designated Equity Provider” (a person
or group of persons holding an interest in the Applicant) had a “Tangible Net Worth” of
“$500 or more per kW of proposed Contract Capacity at the end of the most recent fiscal
year.”263 The FIT Rules contained detailed definitions of who could be considered a
“Designated Equity Provider” and how “Tangible Net Worth” was to be calculated.?64

528. In its applications, the Claimant did not provide the required audited financial
statements.° Neither did it describe the calculations used to determine the Tangible

Net Worth. As Mr. Duffy explained, this failure did not allow the OPA to assess the
applicant's Tangible Net Worth:

“[The Claimant] equated its financial net worth with the alleged value of its
turbine agreement with GE. However, there was no information on the
aggregate book value of all of Mesa Power Group's assets or liabilities,
nor any information on amounts with respect to the components listed in
sub-section (c) of the definition of Tangible Net Worth. Without this
information, we could not consider that an appropriate summary of the
Tangible Net Worth calculation had been provided.”26°

529. The Claimant contends that the Tangible Net Worth could be “derived from the
information listed on page 52 of GE's 2008 audited financial statements”.?°” In response,
Mr. Duffy acknowledges that this is correct, but explains that it was not feasible in
practice, which is the reason why the FIT Rules required summaries of the calculations:

“Of course it is true that a company's ‘Tangible Net Worth’, as defined in
the FIT Rules, can be derived from its financial statements — that would be
true of every application that we received in the FIT Program. However,
the OPA's role was not to derive anything from the financial statements -
if we had to do so for every application, we simply would have been unable
to process them all. This is why the onus was on the applicants and that
is why the FIT Rules clearly required applicants to attach a summary
outlining and describing the calculation used to determine the Tangible
Net Worth of Designated Equity.”

530. The Respondent has thus furnished reasonable explanations as to why the Claimant's
applications were not awarded the three criteria points. In these circumstances, the
Tribunal rejects the Claimant's complaint that its TTD and Arran projects were evaluated
and ranked in an unfair and arbitrary manner.?°°

(ii) The OPA’s decision not to run the ECT

531. The Tribunal has described below (§§616 et. seq.) the circumstances in which and the
reasons why the ECT was not carried out in August 2010. The Tribunal refers to that

(iii) The allegedly better treatment offered by the OPA to other FIT applicants and the

Claimants being granted to these applicants

with these other applicants and granted them benefits which were not available to the
Claimant.?”° The Tribunal has addressed the Claimant's objections that particular FIT
applicants received better treatment below (§§671 et. seq.).2”" The Tribunal refers to
that discussion and for the reasons mentioned there rejects the Claimant's submission.

(iv) The release of the FIT Program rankings on 21 December 2010

533. On 21 December 2010, the OPA published the priority rankings for applications that had
not received a FIT Contract in the first round of FIT Contract offers. The Claimant alleges
that these rankings were “capricious and arbitrary”, but has given no reason to support
this allegation.2’? As a result, the Tribunal considers that this complaint is insufficiently
pled and without any established foundation. Accordingly it dismisses it.

(v) The OPA’s alleged misadministration of the FIT Program

534. The Claimant submits that the OPA’s refusal to disclose the scores for the Claimant's
TTD and Arran wind projects, as well as the reasons for those scores, constitutes an
“arbitrary abuse of authority” and violates “Mesa’s right to a fair, good faith and
transparent process as protected by Article 1105”.2’ It further alleges that the failure of
the OPA (and the Ministry of Energy) to meet with the Claimant and explain the ranking
also violates Article 1105.274

projects complied with the FIT Rules. It is thus irrelevant whether the OPA disclosed the
details of the rankings to the Claimant, especially in circumstances where the Claimant
does not allege to have suffered a loss as a result of the non-disclosure. In any event,
the Tribunal notes that it is the OPA’s usual practice not to disclose the results of a
procurement process.?’5 Moreover, the Claimant has not established that the OPA gave
access to the information at stake to other applicants. For all these reasons, the
Claimant’s arguments cannot be accepted.

The Claimant also complains that other projects were given higher rankings than its own,
although they did not have better qualifications.?”° This argument too can be dismissed
for the reasons just mentioned.

(vi) The OPA’s decision on the information to be included in the TAT tables and
(vii) The OPA’s decision to offer NextEra a FIT Contract with connection points on the 500

tables concerning connection point capability (specifically the L7S connection point)
violated Article 1105.2’’ It also contends that the OPA granted special privileges to
NextEra by allowing it to connect to the 500 kV Bruce to Longwood Line.?78

The Tribunal recalls that the Claimant bears the burden of establishing a violation of
Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA. It further recalls that these arguments were made in the
Claimant’s Reply and were fully addressed in the Respondent's Rejoinder. Thereafter,
the Claimant did not refute the substance of Canada’s arguments, be it at the hearing,
or in its post-hearing brief. The Respondent's arguments thus stand unrebutted.

In respect of the TAT Tables, the Respondent submits that the relevant information was
available to all FIT applicants, including the Claimant. In addition, the Claimant could
have approached the IESO for more information, if it wished.2”° With regard to the OPA’s

Claimant has not submitted any cogent evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal cannot but
dismiss the Claimant's arguments on these matters. In any event, the Tribunal notes that
the Claimant has not alleged how it incurred any loss on account of these alleged
breaches of Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA.

(viii) The award of FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011

540. The OPA awarded the third round of FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011. None of the
Claimant’s projects received a FIT Contract. The 4 July award of FIT Contracts was
largely the result of the reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium and of the
Bruce to Milton line allocation process. For the reasons mentioned in sub-section (b) and
(c) below, neither of these events has been held to constitute a breach of Article 1105(1).
It follows that the same outcome must prevail in connection with the award of FIT
Contracts on 4 July 2011, which was effectively the result of these events. The
Claimant's complaint must thus be dismissed.

541.

In conclusion, while Mesa has challenged many actions, these acts are essentially steps
in the implementation of Ontario policy and the Tribunal finds the policy unobjectionable.
And where the challenged acts involve an allegation of collusion or unfair preference,
there is simply insufficient evidence to establish the same.”°"

b. The GEIA

542. The Claimant contends that through the GEIA, Ontario unjustifiably gave the Korean
Consortium preferential treatment at the expense of FIT Applicants including itself, who
consequently invested in Ontario “under false pretenses.” Specifically, Mesa makes the
following submission:

“The implementation of the GEIA was a breach of NAFTA Article 1105 that
directly harmed the Investor. Ontario entered into an agreement that
unfairly diminished the prospects for investors that were already
participating in the renewable energy program, by blocking off capacity for

280 Rej. §211 relying on Exh. R-181.

281 These findings equally apply to the Claimant's allegations concerning breaches of Canadian
administrative law (Reply §680).

130

545.

the Korean Consortium that had originally been intended for FIT applicants
was unfair, and caused harm to Mesa [sic]. Further, Ontario failed to act
with fairness and candor by providing inaccurate and incomplete
information about the GEIA to the public when it was signed. Ontario also
failed to disclose key aspects of the GEIA which would be necessary for
any of its competitors to fairly understand their position in the Ontario
renewable energy market in comparison with the Korean Consortium.”

. Accordingly, the Claimant contends that by entering into the GEIA and providing better
treatment to the Korean Consortium than to FIT Applicants (i. below);2° and failing to
disclose the GEIA terms (ii. below),78* Ontario violated Article 1105. It further contends
that the delay in running the ECT due to the Consortium?®° also breached the GEIA (iii.
below). The Tribunal will examine each of these arguments in turn.

(i) Entering into the GEIA and providing better treatment to the Korean Consortium

(a) The Claimant's Position

. The Claimant argues that Ontario entered into the GEIA in 2010 although it knew that
the FIT Program would be a success and that it would be sufficient to meet Ontario’s
renewable energy goals. By entering into the GEIA in these circumstances when it was
not bound to do so under the terms of the MOU with the Korean Consortium,”® the
Respondent has breached Article 1105.

It is the Claimant's further submission that the Respondent breached Article 1105,
because it provided “more favorable transmission treatment”*’ to the investments under
the GEIA than to those under the FIT Program.”®* It notes that the members of the
Korean Consortium are in the same circumstances as the FIT Applicants: a power
purchase agreement under the GEIA is like a power purchase agreement under the FIT
Program. Power purchase agreements under the GEIA had to meet the very same
conditions imposed under the FIT Program concerning minimum domestic content, land

access, documentation, quarterly status reports, and waiver forms.®? In spite of this
likeness, the Government conferred additional benefits on the Korean Consortium under
the GEIA to the detriment of applicants under the FIT Program including the Claimant.

The Claimant refutes the Respondent's contention that benefits were conferred on the
Korean Consortium in exchange for extra investments in Ontario.” For instance, so
says Mesa, to be entitled to the Economic Development Adder (“EDA”), the Korean
Consortium only had to designate a manufacturing partner, without having to actually
engage in manufacturing.7%"

On a similar basis, the Claimant disputes the Respondent’s submission that the Korean
Consortium was needed as an “anchor tenant”. For Mesa, “[t]he fact that the [GEIA] was
kept a secret until the stakeholders already were preparing their FIT Applications
contradicts the suggestion that the Korean consortium was needed as an ‘anchor

tenant’”.2°

Finally, the Claimant stresses that “[f]rom the very beginning, the Korean Consortium’s
‘sweetheart deal’ was attacked by the press, the Opposition Party, and even the
Government's own party. The Cabinet did not want to (and did not) approve this deal,
and the entire operation was later criticized by the Auditor General.”2°

(b) The Respondent's Position

The Respondent submits that “[t]here is nothing manifestly arbitrary, grossly unjust,
egregious or shocking about a government entering into an investment agreement in
which it accords certain advantages to a particular investor in exchange for certain
investment commitments by that investor.”

It notes that, at the time of the conclusion of the GEIA in January 2010, the OPA had
received several applications, but that these were not “good applications”, and that the
FIT Program was at the risk of becoming a massive failure.2°°

Replying to the Claimant's argument that better treatment was provided to the Korean
Consortium over FIT Applicants, Canada argues that undertakings with respect to large-
scale manufacturing and job creation were imposed on the Korean Consortium through
the GEIA, which justified such treatment. The Korean Consortium had agreed to
investments valued at CAD$ 7 billion, which distinguished it from FIT Applicants such as

the Claimant.

(c) Analysis

The Claimant's submission under this head focuses on the decision by Ontario to enter
into the GEIA (which is said to have afforded the Korean Consortium preferential
treatment). According to the Claimant, this decision, in and of itself, breached Article
1105.

In reviewing this alleged breach, the Tribunal must bear in mind the deference which
NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals owe a state when it comes to assessing how to regulate
and manage its affairs. This deference notably applies to the decision to enter into
investment agreements.” As noted by the S.D. Myers tribunal, “[w]hen interpreting and
applying the ‘minimum standard’, a Chapter Eleven tribunal does not have an open-
ended mandate to second-guess government decision-making.”2%” The tribunal in
Bilcon, a case which the Claimant has cited with approval, also held that “[t]he imprudent
exercise of discretion or even outright mistakes do not, as a rule, lead to a breach of the
international minimum standard.”?%

295 Tr. (31 October 2014) 228:25-229:5.

296 The Claimant agrees with this position. See C-PHB §201 (“a tribunal's role is not to weigh the wisdom
of the decision to enter an agreement, but to determine whether a government provided preferential
treatment when it did so.”).

297 SD Myers, §261.

298 Bilcon §§437, 440. See also SD Myers §263; International Thunderbird §127 (a State “has a wide
discretion with respect to how it carries out such policies by regulation and administrative conduct.”)

554. In August 2008, Samsung approached the Government of Ontario for a special deal on
renewable energy.”°° The parties subsequently entered into negotiations, which
culminated in the signing of the GEIA in January 2010.

555. Under the terms of the GEIA, the Korean Consortium was to develop 2,500 MW of
renewable energy in Ontario and, importantly, to attract into the Province facilities for
manufacturing wind and solar generation equipment and components.°°° In exchange,
the Korean Consortium was guaranteed priority access to 2,500 MW of transmission
capacity in Ontario.°°' The capacity was to be allocated in five phases over five years,
each of approximately 500 MW.*° In consideration for its commitments, the Consortium
was entitled to a price for its electricity that was higher than that of the FIT producers.
This price would be an aggregate of (i) the price payable to renewable energy producers
under the FIT Rules plus (ii) an additional EDA calculated in accordance with the terms
of the GEIA.

551

>

It is critical to note, at the outset, that the arrangement encapsulated in the GEIA was
not at all comparable with or equivalent to the FIT Program. Contrary to the Claimant's
characterization, these were not two competing, interchangeable tracks. Unlike the FIT
Program, the GEIA was designed to secure a major “anchor” operator in Ontario, in order
to give momentum to its province-wide green energy initiative. But more importantly than
this, the GEIA was concerned with local economic development, at a time of economic
difficulty. The GEIA entailed a CAD$ 7 billion investment, and the creation of substantial
manufacturing facilities over multiple phases; thousands of jobs in the renewable energy
sector; and further indirect employment in finance and other service industries, as well
as related manufacturing industries. As such, the generation of electricity from
renewable sources was only one element of this initiative.

557. Put another way, even if sufficient megawattage was achievable from the FIT
participants alone, the other, broader objectives of the GEIA would remain and formed
no part of the FIT Program.

558. It follows — again contrary to the Claimant’s characterization — that the position of the

559.

560.

56

Korean Consortium cannot be compared with the position of FIT Applicants. It was
agreeing to a different set of undertakings, on a different scale. And hence, necessarily,
the Korean Consortium secured an entitlement to different treatment. It follows that there
is no basis to deem this difference in treatment discrimination, or the product of
arbitrariness.

The fact that other entities (such as Pattern Energy Group LP) could seek to work within
the Korean Consortium project, instead of proceeding alone with individual FIT
applications, is of no relevance. Any advantage they thereby achieved does not change
the fundamental point that the GEIA (of which such entities would form part) was a

different project, which would necessarily proceed on different terms.

Further, there is no basis to conclude that the GEIA was designed to undermine the FIT

Program, and nor would there have been any reason for so doing.

. The reason for Ontario’s entry into the GEIA can be ascertained from the

“Backgrounder” which was issued by the Government at the time, and which reads in
pertinent part as follows:

“The agreement stems from opportunities created for developers and
investors through Ontario's Green Energy Act, and is expected to be among
the first of many major investments to result from the leadership position
Ontario has taken in green energy.

[The Korean Consortium] will be an anchor tenant in growing a new, vibrant
green economy in Ontario. [...]

The agreement will lead to more than 16,000 green energy jobs over six
years and bring $7 billion of renewable generation investment to Ontario.

[-.]

In addition, the increased renewable energy development and
manufacturing activities will support indirect job creation in areas such as
finance, consulting and other manufacturing, service and development
industries. [...]

These manufacturing facilities will produce wind turbine towers, wind blades,
solar inverters and solar assembly in Ontario, creating more than 1,440
manufacturing and related jobs in the renewable energy industry. [...]

The local availability of these manufactured components will also help other
renewable energy developers meet the Feed-In Tariff (FIT) domestic content

303 Exh. R-076.

135

requirements. An additional 700 manufacturing jobs are also anticipated to
supply components not manufactured by the Consortium. [...]

The Consortium’s renewable energy projects will deliver an estimated 110
million megawatt-hours of emissions-free electricity over the 25-year lifetime
of the project. That's enough power to supply the electricity needs of all
Ontario homes for nearly three years. Over the lifetime of these contracts,
the wind and solar projects will displace 40 Megatonnes of carbon dioxide
(CO2, the leading greenhouse gas) compared to what would be emitted by
equivalent gas-fired generation. [...]

The 2,500 MW of wind and solar power capacity to be built by the
Consortium will triple Ontario’s renewable wind and solar energy generation.

The renewable energy projects committed to under this agreement will take
advantage of the more than 20 transmission projects announced last fall.
The transmission projects will unlock significant opportunities for green
energy projects across the province. [...]

All projects under the agreement would be subject to the Consortium
entering into required agreements as well as obtaining required licences and
approvals. [...]

To ensure value for Ontarians, the consortium and the government have
agreed to market rate lease of government lands.”

562. The “Backgrounder” effectively followed up on an earlier announcement which Ontario
had issued on 15 December 2009 and in which it justified its deal with the Korean
Consortium as follows:

“What does this mean for Samsung? [...]
We are in discussions with Samsung which hopes to cultivate a green

manufacturing sector in Ontario in light of our recently launched FIT
program, which has generated significant interest.

Negotiations are progressing and we're taking the time to ensure we get it
right.

The Samsung proposal is about more than just renewable generation, it
would help kick-start Ontario's green economy thr[o]u[gh] $7 billion in direct
investment, create approximately 16,000 direct and indirect positions and
cultivate manufacturing plants as well renewable generation.

[-.]

How can the government justify the Samsung when there are so many
others willing to develop renewable energy without extra monetary
incentives?

Samsung has proposed something no one else has; the construction of
manufacturing plants to produce wind turbine and solar components in

136

Ontario. These manufacturing plants’ orders will provide a foundation for the
green manufacturing sector in Ontario.”°°*

563. Susan Lo, the Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for the implementation of the GEIA
at the Ministry of Energy, testified that Ontario entered into the GEIA because the
Government was uncertain how much interest the FIT Program would generate and
because the Korean Consortium would function as an “anchor tenant”:

“[Ontario] was uncertain of how much interest the FIT Program would
generate because of the economic conditions at the time. Entering into a
separate framework agreement with the Korean Consortium was seen by
Ontario as a prudent means of establishing a foundation for renewable
energy generation in the province. The Korean Consortium would provide
an ‘anchor tenant’ for Ontario’s renewable energy sector. Thus, even if the
FIT Program failed to generate considerable interest, there would still be a
significant increase in the amount of renewable electricity being generated
for the province.”

564. Ms. Lo further testified that the GEIA was expected to develop the manufacturing
industry necessary to support FIT applicants:

“[T]he GEIA ensured the establishment of a green energy manufacturing
sector in Ontario [...] the FIT Program contained requirements that
developers source goods and services from Ontario in order to stimulate
economic development and job growth. However, at the time, there was
almost no local manufacturing available to meet these requirements. The
manufacturing facilities required by the GEIA would assist the other
renewable energy developers in the FIT Program to meet their domestic
content requirements.”2°>

565. The rationale for the conclusion of the GEIA was thus fourfold. It included (i) a
commitment of an anchor tenant (in circumstances where there were concerns as to the
ability of the Ontario Government to achieve its renewable energy goals); (ii) the
generation in substantial quantities of green electricity; (iii) the attraction of
manufacturing plants to Ontario (and in turn the facilitation of domestic content
requirements in the FIT Program); and (iv) the creation of jobs (at a time of economic
difficulty). These objectives were met — or at least were believed to have been met — by
the terms of the GEIA. As will be seen below, the Korean Consortium undertook
substantial generation and manufacturing obligations, and its entitlement to transmission

568.

capacity was contingent on meeting its commitments to establish and operate
manufacturing plants in accordance with the agreed schedule.”

The Government's decision to enter into the GEIA, in spite of the effect that it would have
on the FIT Program applicants, was well-explained by the Government:

“[The Korean Consortium] has proposed the construction of manufacturing
plants to produce both wind turbine and solar components in Ontario. No
one else has offered something on this scale. Orders for these products will
provide a foundation for the green manufacturing sector in Ontario. This kind
of economic development is a key objective of both FIT and the Green
Energy Act.” 9°8

In these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot find that the conclusion of the GEIA was

“arbitrary”, “grossly unfair” or “unreasonable”.

The Claimant objects that “[t]he [GEIA] did not require any special investment on the part
of the Korean Consortium”,°°° calling the consortium’s commitments under the GEIA
“fictitious”. It argues that the GEIA’s manufacturing commitments were nothing more
than the domestic content requirements of the FIT Program. It further asserts that the
“real” obligation of the Korean Consortium under the GEIA was not to create jobs, but
merely to identify the jobs which its suppliers would have created, a job growth equally
accomplished through the FIT Program’s domestic content requirement. Mesa further
observes that Ontario did not distinguish between the FIT Program and the Korean
Consortium’s project when ascertaining the number of jobs created.3"°

The Tribunal cannot accept Mesa’s arguments. It notes in particular that the Korean
Consortium entered into manufacturing partnership agreements with four partners to
establish manufacturing plants in Ontario: SMA (solar inverters); Canadian Solar (solar
panels); Siemens (wind turbine blades); and CS Wind (turbine towers).°"' In December
2010, i.e. 11 months after the GEIA, Siemens issued a press release stating that it would
establish a manufacturing plant in Ontario to help Samsung, a member of the Korean
Consortium, to meet its “contractual” commitments:

“Siemens selects Tillsonburg, Ontario, as new home for Canadian wind
turbine blade manufacturing facility

Siemens announced today that it has selected Tillsonburg, Ontario, for its
Canadian wind turbine blade manufacturing site. The blade factory will be
established in an existing 253,000-square-foot facility, located on 40 acres,
that was originally opened in 1975. It’s the company’s first manufacturing
plant for wind turbine components in Canada and represents an investment
in excess of $20 million CAD. The manufacturing, service operations and
associated back-office activities are expected to create up to 300 jobs. An
additional 600 related jobs for the construction and commissioning is
expected to be created during the build-out of the wind farms under
agreement with Samsung and Pattern.

This new manufacturing facility in Tillsonburg is intended to allow Siemens
to help Samsung and Pattern Energy meet their contractual requirements to
supply 600 MW of renewable energy to the province of Ontario. The factory
is expected to produce all of the wind turbine blades for Siemens projects in
the province.”*'?

Furthermore, the GEIA imposed substantial generation and manufacturing obligations
on the Korean Consortium. Pursuant to Articles 8.1, 8.4 and 9.3 of the GEIA, the
Government agreed to an approach for calculating the EDA that was based on the
Korean Consortium’s ability to bring manufacturing plants to Ontario. More importantly,
the Korean Consortium had to provide evidence that the manufacturing plants of its
partners were established and operational in accordance with the Operational Time
Frame set out in Article 8.1 of the GEIA.°" While the Korean Consortium was guaranteed
priority access to 2,500 MW of transmission capacity in Ontario in five phases, such
guarantee was conditional upon the Consortium complying with commitments to
establish and operate four manufacturing plants in accordance with the schedule set out
in the GEIA.°"4 Thus, while benefits were given to the Korean Consortium, they were
contingent on the Consortium meeting specific conditions (conditions which were
different in both nature and scale to those imposed on FIT participants).

The GEIA was amended in 2011. Under the terms of the Amended GEIA, to be eligible
for the full EDA, the Korean Consortium was required to demonstrate a minimum
average of 765 jobs at the plants of its manufacturing partners over a period of at least
three years.°'® Additionally, the EDA was subject to reduction in the event that a

the GEIA and the amended GEIA thus linked the advantages offered to the Korean
Consortium under the GEIA to the creation of jobs and the continued commercial
operation of the Consortium’s manufacturing plants.

In her testimony at the hearing, Ms. Lo confirmed that, as opposed to the FIT Program,
the GEIA would result in job growth in the manufacturing sector:

“Q. And so for purposes of the GEIA and this renewable energy project, at
least you were getting the -- the statement, you said you were getting these
jobs, you were getting that through the FIT Program, as well; correct?

A. Well, definitely through the FIT Program we would get jobs and many of
them were in construction. They weren't necessarily in the manufacturing
sector, and the government was very concerned with building a green tech
sector.”5"7

In the circumstances, the Tribunal does not agree that the generation and manufacturing
obligations imposed on the Korean Consortium were “fictitious.” In fact, it appears that
the Korean Consortium had some success in attracting green energy manufacturing jobs

to Ontario.*"®

Further, and in any event, whether or not the GEIA actually succeeded in its objectives
is not a relevant consideration, as long as the conclusion of the GEIA was pursuant to a
bona fide policy decision by the Ontario government, at the time.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal does not regard the conclusion of the GEIA as
inconsistent with Article 1105. The Government provided benefits to the Korean
Consortium under the GEIA over and above those provided under the FIT Program, but
it did so in the context of a program that was not comparable to the FIT Program. On the
contrary, the benefits were in return for specific, time-bound and substantial
commitments undertaken by the Korean Consortium, different in scale and nature to
those imposed on FIT participants, and designed to achieve policy goals beyond the
scope of the FIT Program.

It is true that, at the time when the GEIA was signed, the FIT Program was already in
place. It is also true that whilst in some quarters concerns were expressed as to the likely

success of the FIT Program, others were confident on this.*'° Indeed, in May 2009, the
OPA had recognized that there was a “[h]igh level of developer interest and expectation”
and “[h]igh level of investor / financial sector interest” in the FIT Program.°2° Equally,
however, the Respondent contends that the FIT Applications received at the time of the
conclusion of the GEIA in January 2010 were not “good applications” and that (viewed
at that time) there was a risk that the FIT Program might be a failure. The Tribunal notes
in this regard that in the FIT/MicroFIT announcement of 15 December 2009, the Ministry
of Energy acknowledged that it was “seeing a tremendous response to the FIT and
microFIT programs”.** On the other hand, as Richard Duffy, Manager of Generation
Procurement at the OPA, testified, additional information had been required from the FIT
Applicants (albeit he did not consider that the Program would be a failure).

576. It must also be noted that Jim MacDougall, the Manager of the OPA, admitted that when
he learned about the GEIA, he was “not terribly pleased by the competing development
opportunities that were running in parallel”.°22 He added that in the final months leading
up to the GEIA he had realized that the deal with the Korean Consortium would
negatively impact FIT Applicants. °°

577. Further, according to the evidence of Canada’s witnesses, Ontario had no obligation
under the MOU of December 2008 to enter into the GEIA.°4 It could have chosen not to
sign the formal agreement in January 2010. And, on one view, this might have seemed
to make sense considering that it was known in 2009 that the GEIA would impact the
limited available transmission capacity.°7°

319 See Testimony of Rick Jennings, Tr. (27 October 2014) 270:1-20; Testimony of Sue Lo, Tr. (28
October 2014) 64:4-16 (FIT program was very successful with applications for 10,000 MW).

to be allocated to the Korean Consortium.”); Tr. (28 October 2014) 276:10-20 (“But certainly the
existence of the Korean Consortium commitment through the framework agreement created greater
pressure on the FIT program and less capacity available through the FIT program to offer contracts.”).

141

578. Equally, the actual need for an “anchor tenant” could be questioned. By the time the
GEIA was signed in January 2010 (as opposed to its precursor MOU signed in
December 2008), it was known that the applications under the FIT Program far exceeded
the available capacity. Therefore, it could be argued that no anchor tenant was needed.
Moreover, Samsung arguably had no experience with developing wind or solar power
and did not then operate renewable energy projects elsewhere. The Claimant also
contends that there were procedural irregularities in the GEIA (that it was not approved
by the Cabinet,°?° and that Ontario’s opposition leader's request to have the deal be
examined by the Auditor General before proceeding was ignored*’).

579. Be that as it may, these are all policy considerations and questions that were for the
government of Ontario alone. It is not the Tribunal’s role to act as an appellate body in
this regard, or second guess or weigh the wisdom of Ontario’s decision to enter into the
GEIA at the time — even if sufficient renewable energy would possibly have been
available through the FIT Program.°%° Rather, it is for the Tribunal to examine whether,
as the Claimant alleges, the beneficial treatment was granted to the Korean Consortium
arbitrarily, or in any other way that contravened Article 1105. In particular, the Tribunal
must determine whether Canada’s conclusion of the GEIA lacked a justification, and
whether there was a reasonable relationship between the justification supplied and the
terms of the GEIA.°2° For the reasons discussed above, the Tribunal comes to the
conclusion that such justification and reasonable relationship did exist. It is a different
question, on which the Tribunal does not express a view, whether entering into the GEIA
was a wise move under the circumstances. As a result, the Tribunal rejects the claim
that by entering into the GEIA, Canada breached Article 1105 of the NAFTA.

580. In the same context, the Claimant protests about the detrimental effect which the GEIA
produced on FIT Applicants including itself. In particular, it criticizes the reservation of

326 C-PHB §72.

327 C-PHB §77.

whether such legislation breaches the Treaty. Claimants have not succeeded in demonstrating that this
was an abusive or irrational decision”).

823 The Claimant agrees, although it adopts a different formulation. See Tr. (26 October 2014) 61:19-
62:2 (“And with respect to the protection against arbitrariness, the state breaches its customary
international law obligation when it acts arbitrarily for instance, on prejudice or preference rather than
on reason or fact. Arbitrariness also occurs when discretionary decisions by governments are based on
irrelevant considerations and when relevant considerations are ignored.”).

capacity for the Korean Consortium in the Bruce Region.°*° According to the Claimant,
the “secret’*’ reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium was politically
motivated**? and in disregard of the FIT process.**° Indeed, so it is argued, it effectively
undermined the FIT process.** Although the OPA had estimated that 1,200 MW of
transmission capacity would be available in the Bruce Region because of the Bruce to
Milton Line, it turned out that only 750 MW were available to FIT Applicants, as the
remainder was set aside for the Korean Consortium.°°>

. As was mentioned above, in exchange for the commitments of the Korean Consortium,

the GEIA granted the Korean Consortium a guarantee of access to priority
transmission.*°° The Consortium could reserve this capacity anywhere in Ontario by
indicating connection points of its choice.*°7 On 30 September 2010, the Consortium
indicated provisional connection points in the Bruce Region.** As a result, on 17
September 2010, the Minister of Energy directed the OPA to reserve 500 MW of
transmission capacity in the Bruce area.**° The Korean Consortium then formally asked
for capacity in the Bruce Region in November of that year. °°

The Claimant first alleges that the reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium was
done in “secret.” The record does not substantiate this allegation. As will be seen below
(§§596 et. seq.), the Claimant was aware that the Korean Consortium had the right to
reserve transmission capacity in Ontario even before its investment in Canada. Although
it could not have known then that the Korean Consortium would actually reserve capacity
in the Bruce Region, the Claimant should have known that this was a serious possibility.
Indeed, the Claimant’s expert Seabron Adamson testified that participants in the wind

industry would have been aware that transmission capacity would become available on
the Bruce to Milton Line since the time of its proposed development. In the same vein,
Bob Chow, Director of Transmission Integration at the OPA, testified that the Bruce
Region was a “recipe for success” as the wind regime was the strongest in the province.
Further, the fact that the Government was reserving transmission capacity as a priority
for the Korean Consortium was officially announced on 21 January 2010, i.e. one anda
half years before capacity was allocated in the Bruce Region,**' and the fact that 500
MW were reserved in the Bruce Region for the Korean Consortium was publicly
announced on 17 September 2010, i.e. months before the Bruce to Milton allocation
process was developed.** Thus, the Tribunal cannot agree that the reservation of
capacity for the Korean Consortium was done in “secret.”

The Claimant next argues that the reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium
was in and of itself incompatible with Article 1105. For reasons it has already mentioned
above , the Tribunal cannot accept this argument. While the benefit of priority access to
transmission conferred on the Korean Consortium reduced the available capacity in the
Bruce Region, this was merely the result of the limited capacity present in Ontario, a fact
that was well known to all at the time. To meet its stated goals for renewable energy
generation, economic development and job growth, the Government chose to reserve
capacity for the Korean Consortium. It did so in the context of a policy initiative that was
not comparable to the FIT Program, and in the exercise of its discretion as to how best
to achieve its objectives. This was an exercise of discretion which the Tribunal cannot
fault under the circumstances, and has no basis to second-guess.

An internal document evinces the Government's reasons for the reservation of capacity
for the Korean Consortium in spite of the FIT Program, in the following terms:

“Doesn't the set aside for the Korean consortium undermine the whole intent
of the FIT program?

Not at all. The Korean Consortium has proposed something no one else has;
the construction of manufacturing plants to produce wind turbine and solar
components in Ontario. Orders for these products will provide a foundation
for the green manufacturing sector in Ontario. This kind of economic
development is a key objective of both FIT and the Green Energy Act.”54°

343 Exh. C-0110.

144

585.

586.

587.

The Claimant also complains that, in addition to the reservation of transmission capacity,
the Korean Consortium was given better governmental assistance; “received better
pricing for renewable power sold in PPAs and automatic rights to increase power project
size”; was allowed to engage in a “wait-and-see” approach to acquire low ranked FIT
projects that were unlikely to get contracts and then convert them into GEIA projects;
and received exclusivity as the Ministry agreed that it would not enter into similar
transactions with third parties upon terms identical to the GEIA. In the Tribunal’s view,
assuming that these benefits were effectively granted, they would not rise to the level of
a breach of Article 1105. If granted, they may or may not have been the best, or even
just a good exercise, of judgment and discretion for purposes of reaching the stated
objectives. But even if this were so, the facts in the record do not evidence conduct
meeting the stringent requirements of Article 1105.

The Claimant further refers to the Korean Consortium’s breaches of the GEIA and
challenges the Government's choice not to terminate the GEIA as a consequence of
those breaches. It claims that this choice resulted in a breach of Article 1105.5 It is true
that the Korean Consortium may not have met the deadlines provided in the 2010 GEIA
and that the agreement was amended on two occasions.*“° Under the first amendment,
the EDA was reduced in exchange for an extension of the time limits stipulated in the
agreement*“* and the time for specifying Phase 2 connection points was eliminated.*4”
Under the second amendment, the priority transmission capacity of the Korean
Consortium was reduced from 2,500 MW to 1,369 MW.%8 These amendments thus
linked the level of the EDA to the creation of jobs and the continued operation of
manufacturing plants.

While it may be that all the original intentions of the Ministry in entering into the GEIA
were not fully met, it remains that the principal contractual obligations of the Korean
Consortium were retained. As the Claimant itself recognizes, “° a government cannot be
faulted for being unable to meet each and every one of its stated policy goals, a

344 The Tribunal notes that the Claimant first fully expanded this argument in its post-hearing submission
and thus the Respondent had no opportunity to address it.

recognition that is particularly apposite in the context of an Article 1105 assessment. In
the circumstances, Mesa’s claim that the Government's failure to terminate the GEIA

was “grossly unfair” or “inequitable” cannot be sustained.

(ii) Non-Disclosure of the GEIA Terms

(a) The Claimant's Position

588. It is the Claimant’s case that the customary international law standard is breached when
a party acts without transparency and that “[f]rom the first time Mesa engaged with
Ontario’s FIT Program in 2009, there was a complete lack of transparency and candor
on Ontario's part with respect to its dealings with the Korean Consortium.”>® It points
out that the OPA was not informed until the summer of 2009 of the secret deal with the
Korean Consortium and the public was only made aware of it on 26 September 2009.
The Claimant adds that the public was not told of the MOU of December 2008 nor of the
Framework Agreement which was allegedly signed in October 2009 until after the FIT
Program was announced.**"

589. Mesa also claims that in 2010 the Minister of Economic Development and Trade
encouraged it to invest in Canada. However neither the Minister nor her officials advised
Mesa that there was another possibility of accessing the Ontario market than the FIT
Program. In other words, it was not invited to engage in negotiations with the Ontario
Government to invest in renewable energy outside the FIT Program.°52

590. To counter the Respondent's invocation of reports published in the Toronto Star, the
Claimant contends that these reports “were vague and misleading and did not disclose

the main contours of the deal, such as priority transmission access.”°°?

59

. To the extent that the GEIA was publicly discussed, the Claimant submits that “the
government of Ontario made material misrepresentations at the highest levels as to the
content and terms of the GEIA. These representations were fundamentally misleading

as to the opportunities available to access the renewable energy market in Ontario, as
well as to the conditions that access could be obtained.”°54

(b) The Respondent's Position

Canada disputes the Claimant’s submission that Article 1105 imposes an obligation on
the NAFTA Parties to act with complete transparency in all their operations. It states that
no authority supports the Claimant’s argument that NAFTA Parties must be transparent
about their commercial negotiations. Such negotiations, given their nature, must be
allowed to be conducted in confidence in order to succeed. *°

In any event, the Respondent states that the Government publicized its dealings with
the Korean Consortium “as much as possible.”*°* The Toronto Star article, which was
published prior to the Claimant's investment in Canada, discussed the main terms of the
forthcoming GEIA, including the manufacturing commitments, the creation of jobs, and
the EDA. Further, through its September direction to the OPA requiring the reservation
of transmission capacity, the Government publicly disclosed that it was negotiating a
province-wide framework agreement for the generation of renewable energy. Therefore,
so says Canada, Mesa was fully aware of the fact that the GEIA was being negotiated
and of its key terms. As a result, the Claimant's complaints about the secret nature of
the deal must be dismissed.

In answer to the Claimant's reliance on statements of the Minister of Economic
Development and Trade, the Respondent observes that Mesa merely alleges that the
Minister had encouraged it to invest in Ontario. Encouragements of this nature are
insufficient to create expectations that could be pertinent for purposes of a breach of
Article 1105. Finally, the statements of the Minister are in any event irrelevant, because
the Claimant had already made its investment when it spoke with the Minister.

(c) Analysis

The Claimant asserts that transparency forms part of the customary international law
standard enshrined in Article 1105, which the Respondent disputes. The existence of an

596.

obligation of transparency under international law and under Article 1105 of the NAFTA
in particular is a controversial issue. The Tribunal does not deem it necessary to enter
into the merits of this debate in the context of this dispute. For the reasons discussed
below, the Tribunal finds that sufficient information about the Ministry's dealings with the
Korean Consortium was in the public domain prior to the Claimant's investment in
Ontario. Thus, even if an obligation of transparency of the kind suggested by the
Claimant existed — an issue on which the Tribunal expresses no opinion — that obligation
would be satisfied here.

On 24 September 2009, the Ministry of Energy directed the OPA to develop the FIT
Program. Two days later, on 26 September, the Toronto Star reported for the first time

that Ontario was in negotiations with Samsung for a special deal on renewable energy: °°”

“Ontario eyes green job bonanza

The Ontario government is in advanced negotiations with South Korean
industrial and electronics powerhouse Samsung Group about manufacturing
wind turbines and other green-energy gear — including solar panels — in the
province.

Samsung is considering a multibillion-dollar investment that would stimulate
the creation of several hundred direct jobs and, indirectly, potentially
thousands more. The province, led by the Ministry of Energy and
Infrastructure, has been in talks with Samsung subsidiary Samsung C&T
Corp. for the past year, the Star has learned.

Energy Minister George Smitherman confirmed in an interview with the Star
that serious discussions are ongoing and proceeding well toward the signing
of what he called a ‘historic framework agreement.’

‘They're looking to get into the renewable-energy business in a big way, and
Ontario seems suited to their ambitions,’ said Smitherman.

‘If it comes to fruition, it would see them invest several billions of dollars and
have the prospect of creating hundreds and hundreds of jobs in
manufacturing at the same time.’

That would be a coup for a province that has suffered a steep decline in
manufacturing, particularly in the hard-hit auto sector, and the loss of
thousands of jobs.

It also represents an early sign that Ontario’s new Green Energy and
Economy Act, designed to stimulate the development of renewable-energy
projects, is attracting the foreign investment and ‘green-collar’ jobs promised
by Premier Dalton McGuinty.

387 Exh. R-177, Toronto Star, “Ontario eyes green job bonanza”.

148

[-.]

Smitherman said Samsung, as a developer, will get the same rate as every
other developer taking part in the [FIT] program. But if the company commits
to manufacturing its equipment in Ontario, it will get what he called an
‘economic adder’ on top of the 13.5 cents rate. He wouldn’t say how much
that benefit might be.”

597. On the day on which the news article appeared, the Ministry of Energy and Samsung
C&T Corporation issued a joint statement regretting that information about the
negotiations had been prematurely released to the public:°°°

“Statement from the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure and Samsung C
& T Corporation

Recently information concerning negotiations between Samsung C and T
Corporation and the Government of Ontario has prematurely entered the
public domain.

Both parties regret that months of extraordinarily cooperative effort have
become known even while serious discussions are ongoing.

However, both Samsung C and T Corporation and the Government of
Ontario are pleased to confirm that efforts are progressing well toward the
signing of a historic framework agreement.

While the contents of the proposed agreement remain commercially
sensitive, both parties can confirm that Samsung, one of the world’s leading
companies, proposes to establish a new renewable energy business in
Ontario where the Feed in Tariff was recently launched as part of the Green
Energy Act.

The substantial scale of the proposed investment would be a very early sign
of success of the Green Energy Act and would lead to the establishment of
new manufacturing capacity in Ontario.

Both parties are committed to a more formal public presentation once a
framework agreement has been completed.”

598. A few days later, on 30 September 2009, the Minister of Energy publicly directed the
OPA to reserve capacity for the Korean Consortium as follows:

“The Government is exploring opportunities to further enable new green
industries through new investment and job creation and provide incentives
for investment in renewable energy technologies.

| now further direct the OPA [...] to hold in reserve 240 MW of transmission
capacity in Haldimand County and a total of 260 MW of transmission
capacity in Essex County and the Municipality of Chatham-Kent jointly for
renewable energy generating facilities whose proponents have signed a
province-wide framework agreement with the Province.”

599. On 31 October 2009, the Korean Consortium’s priority access to transmission capacity
was addressed in the press in the following terms:55°

“Samsung’s turbine deal in jeopardy

[-.]

Smitherman touted it as a ‘historic framework agreement’ that would see
Samsung develop green energy projects and manufacture equipment to
support them. In return, the province would reward Samsung with incentives
above what other wind and solar developers can get.

[-.]
At issue is what some Liberals believe is a sweetheart deal with a foreign

firm, which would also get priority access to Ontario grid space.”

600. About a week later, on 8 November 2009, the transaction with the Korean Consortium
was once again mentioned in the press.°©°

601. Cole Robertson, who was responsible for the day to day operations of Mesa at the time,
admitted that Mesa was aware of the press reports about the Ministry’s deal with the
Korean Consortium:

“Q. [P]ut yourself back into this position at the time, can you just explain: Did
you see these reports at the time?
THE WITNESS: Yes, sir, did we see them at the time? We did see them at

the time and what was our reaction to them? We were concerned, | think as
any prudent developer would be.

602. Mr. Robertson also conceded that he did not approach the Ministry for further information

on the Toronto Star article or the Ministry's press release:

“Q. Did you contact the Ministry to confirm whether these stories were
accurate, of the GEIA?

A. The Toronto Star story?

Q. Yeah, the Toronto Star story or the initial -- the press release of the same
day from the Ministry?

A. [...] no, we did not contact the Ministry of Energy or the Ontario
Government about the story, no.”

603. Mesa did not even approach the Ministry after the conclusion of the GEIA was publicly

disclosed, as the oral evidence of Mr. Robertson showed:

“Q. Did you contact the Ministry after [the conclusion of the GEIA was made
public]?
A. We did not.”

And further:
“THE WITNESS: On the publications by both the Toronto Star and the OPA

or, | believe, it's Ministry -- Minister of Energy release as it relates to this. On
those articles we did not contact the government.”

604. The Claimant’s expert Mr. Adamson accepted that the Claimant could have known about

September 2009, prior to applying for the FIT Program.°** He also admitted that the
Claimant could have been aware that the Korean Consortium would have priority access
to Ontario's grid space before filing its FIT Applications.

It is true that the OPA was not made aware of the agreement with the Korean Consortium
until the summer of 2009. In fact, Jim MacDougall, the manager of the OPA, testified
that the OPA was never informed of nor consulted about the GEIA negotiations and that,
when he heard about the agreement, he was “not terribly pleased.”°© Yet, pursuant to
Ms. Lo’s plausible explanation, the need to consult with the OPA arose only when the
GEIA had to be put in operation.°°”

understand that that’s the case, but it wouldn't be a normal course of action to consult with the OPA [...]

151

606. It is equally true that on 13 November 2009, the Ministry asked the Korean Consortium
to postpone publicizing the “various elements of the deal” for a “few weeks”:

“[Y]ou should not be going ahead with any public announcement on this or
any other piece of the deal until we have resolved the issue of the signing of
the Framework Agreement. This will simply elicit more questions from the
media that we are not in a position to answer publicly yet and will put us in
a difficult position. Once the FA is signed, and the terms are public, you will
be free to execute the various elements of the deal. Until then, you need to
put this on hold for the time being — hopefully only a couple of weeks. °

607. These facts appear to indicate that the Ministry worked towards two parallel renewable
energy programs — the GEIA and the FIT Program — without fully informing the public
and other stakeholders of one of them, namely the GEIA. Be that as it may, prior to the
Claimant’s investment in November 2009, the following information was publicly
available and known to the Claimant: (i) the negotiations with the Korean Consortium
were at an “advanced stage”*®®; (ii) pursuant to those negotiations, the Korean
Consortium would get an “economic adder” or EDA in addition to the regular rate “if [it]
commit[ted] to manufacturing its equipment in Ontario”’”°; (iii) the OPA had been
instructed to hold in reserve transmission capacity for “generating facilities whose
proponents have signed a province-wide framework agreement’?”'; and (iv) the
agreement with the Korean Consortium “would give them priority access to Ontario[’s]
grid space”.°72

The OPA receives policy direction, and then carries it out, but there wouldn’t be any need to consult
with either body. If say they needed to be consulted with, well, that's their opinion, but working in

during the implementation of the FIT program the Minister of Energy did consult with the OPA? A. The
FIT program is very different, because it is operationalizing a renewable energy program that was.

would the Ministry of Energy consult with the OPA [...]? No. Not necessarily, no.”).

371 Exh. C-105, George Smitherman’s (MOE) Direction of 30 September 2009 to the OPA. The Claimant
argues that the use of the past tense in the Direction (“have signed”) misled the public by suggesting
that a province-wide investment agreement had already been signed, which was not the case. However,
the Tribunal believes that this language is sufficiently broad to encompass investment agreements that
had, already been or were about to be concluded in a near future. As is discussed elsewhere, the
Claimant admitted that it did not request additional information about the GEIA from the Ministry, which
it reasonably should have done had there been an ambiguity.

On the basis of these facts, the Tribunal cannot conclude that the Ministry’s dealings
with the Korean Consortium were secret. Even if the details of the agreement between
the Ministry and the Korean Consortium were not disclosed, sufficient information about
the main terms of the transaction was in the public domain before the Claimant made its
investment in Ontario.*”* What is more, the record shows that the Claimant was well
aware of this information.°”

On a related aspect, the Claimant alleges that it was not given an opportunity to enter
into a similar deal with the Ministry and that it would have done so if it had been given
the opportunity.°’° In this context, it stresses that the agreement with the Korean
Consortium prohibited Ontario from entering into a similar contract®’® unless the latter
agreement was comparable in value and scope to the former.°’”

As was just discussed, before investing in Canada, Mesa knew about the Ministry's
agreement with the Korean Consortium and could have inquired with the competent
officials about a similar investment opportunity in addition to or in lieu of its participation
in the FIT Program. Mr. Adamson, the Claimant's expert, admitted that Mesa could have
approached the Ministry with a proposal for an investment agreement providing for
priority transmission.°”° Yet, Mesa did not do so, as Mr. Robertson explained. Despite
its knowledge of the Ministry’s agreement with the Korean Consortium, Mesa never
asked for additional information about the agreement or the possibility of entering into
its own investment agreement with the province.°’° As the Claimant did not approach
the Ministry with a view to obtaining more information or entering into a GEIA-like
agreement, its submission that it was deprived of an opportunity to enter into such an
agreement can hardly be sustained.

373 The Claimant has alleged that Mesa decided to invest in Ontario in the summer of 2009. If that were
the case, then the Claimant's investment would precede the first Toronto Star Article. However, for the
reasons mentioned above (§§324 et. seq.), the Tribunal considers the date of the Claimant's investment
to be the date of incorporation of its projects i.e. 17 November 2009 for TTD and Arran.

374 The Claimant also submits that because Canada’s deal with the Korean Consortium was not public,
the Korean Consortium “went so far as to require a ‘comfort letter’ explaining the arrangement and its
contours” (C-PHB §30(c)).The Tribunal cannot draw this conclusion on the basis of the evidence
supplied by the Claimant. In any event, even if the Tribunal were to accept the Claimant's argument, it
would not alter the outcome.

. Furthermore, besides Mr. Robertson’s statement that Mesa “would have tried”, the
Claimant has provided no plausible indications that it would actually have approached
the Ministry.°° As it happens, as the Claimant itself acknowledged in its later
submissions, the Ministry could not have entertained a request for a GEIA-like
agreement, due to the lack of transmission capacity resulting from the success of the
FIT Program and the GEIA. Hence, the Ministry rejected all the offers which it received
from investors for a GEIA-like agreement.**' But this is beside the point. What ultimately
matters is that the Claimant had knowledge of the existence and key terms of the
conclusion of the GEIA before it invested into the FIT Program and that it did not seek
another investment opportunity, but proceeded with its investment notwithstanding.

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant also complained of another “secret” deal between
Ontario and the Korean Consortium, to which it refers as the “Framework Agreement”.
Rick Jennings, Assistant Deputy Minister of Energy Supply at the Ministry of Energy
gave evidence that no such additional agreement existed; the framework agreement of
October 2009 was merely an earlier draft of the GEIA. It was not signed in October as
originally planned, but rather in January 2010, at which time it became known as the
GEIA.**? In light of these explanations, which appear credible, the Tribunal will not further

address this complaint.

(iii) Delay of the ECT

. The Claimant submits that, in addition to removing transmission capacity that could have
been awarded to FIT Applicants, the Korean Consortium also delayed the award of the
FIT Contracts.**° It emphasizes that, before the third round of FIT Contracts could be
awarded, the OPA had to conduct an ECT. This ECT was not run as scheduled in August
2010 because the Korean Consortium had not finalized the connection points for its

&

projects under the GEIA.**4 For Mesa, this delay prevented the TTD and Arran projects
from receiving FIT Contracts.3°°

It is true that the ECT was never carried out, a topic further addressed below. It is also
true that the third round of FIT Contracts was delayed. However, as will be discussed in
greater detail in the context of the allocation of capacity in the Bruce Region, Article 1105
provides no guarantee against regulatory change. This is all the more so in the present
case where the FIT Rules expressly state that they may be reviewed and amended,
particularly in response to “significant changes in market conditions or other
circumstances as required.” The Claimant was fully aware of and accepted these
provisions when it filed its FIT Applications with the OPA.

In any event, the sole fact that the ECT was not carried out when it should have been
cannot constitute a breach of Article 1105, especially where the Claimant has not shown

that it was prejudiced by the delay.

c. Allocation of capacity in the Bruce Region

The Claimant argues that it reasonably expected the Ministry and the OPA to “fairly
administer the FIT Rules without acting in a capricious and abusive manner.”
However, the Minister's direction of 3 June 2011 (the “3 June Direction”) led to “arbitrary
and unexpected” changes to the FIT Rules.*®” For the Claimant, the 3 June Direction
was issued without advance notice®®* and departed significantly from the procedure

previously established. °°

For its part, the Respondent denies that the 3 June Direction was an unexpected or
arbitrary change of the FIT Program. According to it, the process used to allocate the
capacity available in the Bruce Region was not materially different from the one publicly
discussed by the OPA ever since the initiation of the FIT Program. In any event, even if
the FIT Program did change in a way that ultimately affected the Claimant, Canada
submits that this change would not violate Article 1105, because that provision does not

prevent a government from changing its regulatory regime in response to new policies
and needs.

The Claimant has raised a litany of objections in respect of the allocation of capacity in
the Bruce Region. In the discussion below, the Tribunal will start by setting forth its
understanding of the allocation process (a), before reviewing the Claimant's objections

(b).

At the outset, however, the Tribunal wishes to recall that Article 1105 does not provide
a guarantee against regulatory change. A State may amend its laws and regulations as
it deems appropriate in light of changing circumstances. The absence of protection
against changes in the legal regime is particularly relevant here in a situation where the
FIT Program had undergone several amendments.°°° In fact, the Claimant itself
recognized that “prospective FIT Applicants [had] to navigate a changing landscape of
FIT Rules and requirements”, and that “Ontario's regulators were continuously updating
and modifying the program”.°*"

Further, as mentioned above, the FIT Rules expressly stipulate that they may be
reviewed and amended, particularly in response to “significant changes in market
conditions or other circumstances as required.”*°* As was already noted, in respect of
the ECT delay, the Claimant was fully aware of and accepted these provisions when it
submitted its FIT Applications.

}) Allocation process

The framework of the FIT Program has been outlined earlier in this Award (§§12 et.
seq.). As mentioned there, the OPA was to conduct an ECT to determine whether the
existing transmission system should be upgraded to accommodate those projects for
which no capacity was available, i.e. projects that had failed the TAT.

While the ECT was to be carried out only for projects that had failed the TAT, additional
capacity on the existing transmission system could have become available following the

390 From the time the program was announced in September 2009 through 2012, the FIT Rules changed
10 times. See Reply fn.109.

TAT run as a result of the addition of new transmission facilities or of the cancellation of
projects.°% Therefore, the first step in the ECT was to conduct an individual project
assessment (“IPA”) so as to determine whether a project could be connected to the
existing grid.°** As part of the IPA, the OPA would provide TAT Tables to FIT Applicants
to inform them where capacity was available.°% As a next step of the ECT, FIT
Applicants could change their connection point during an allotted time so as to make use
of additional capacity in the existing system.*°° Information on how to request a change
of connection point was posted on the OPA’s FIT website.*°”

623. As mentioned above (§§31 et. seq.), no FIT Contracts had been awarded to projects in
the Bruce Region due to the transmission constraints in the region. These constraints
were resolved by the construction of the Bruce to Milton Line in May 2011. The additional
capacity created by this line in the Bruce and West of London regions was originally
planned to be allocated through an ECT.%%8

624. However, by mid-2011, much had changed in the Ontario electricity market.°% First, the
number of FIT Applications far exceeded the available capacity. If all the capacity was
awarded, the impact on electricity prices would have been significant.4°° The Ministry
thus needed to slow down the rate of procurement of renewable energy. Second, the
Ministry also needed to address the decreasing demand of electricity because of the
effect of the economic recession. Third, through the LTEP, Ontario had introduced a new
renewable energy target of 10,700 MW to be met by 2018.4" Out of this target amount,

(noting the success of the FIT Program and the GEGEA, but also noting forecasted impacts on

157

the 2011 Supply Mix Directive required that 10-15% be met with renewables. Ms. Lo
testified about the circumstances that led to the LTEP in the following terms:*°2

“[T]he number of [FIT] applications was growing at a rate that far exceeded
the ability of the physical electricity system [...] to accommodate new
renewables projects. If all of the companies which applied for FIT contracts
were awarded such contracts, a far greater proportion of Ontario’s supply
mix would be made up of renewable energy than had been recommended
by experts, which in turn, would make the operation of the electricity system
difficult to manage.

wd
Moreover, if all of the applications for FIT projects were awarded contracts
under the program the impacts on ratepayers would be significant.

The culmination of these supply and demand factors confirmed [that] Ontario
would need to slow down the rate of its procurement of renewable energy.
Accordingly, the 2010 LTEP introduced a target amount for Ontario to
procure a total of 10,700 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2018.”

625. These factors had implications on the running of the ECT for the Bruce Region as it was
originally contemplated.‘ Indeed, if the Ministry had conducted an ECT along the lines
of the FIT Rules, the exercise would likely have resulted in procurement in excess of the
10,700 MW target set in the LTEP.*™ The Ministry therefore intended to eliminate parts
of the ECT that would result in excess electricity.4°> At the same time, it also intended to
develop a process to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line that was fair and
closely matched the expectations of FIT Applicants.

626. Ultimately, the Ministry decided to adopt a regional ECT process rather than a province-
wide test or a special TAT. Under the regional ECT, FIT Applicants in the Bruce and
West of London regions would have the opportunity to apply for a change of connection
points during a five-day window and to select connection points for which generator paid
upgrades would be required.‘°° This decision was conveyed to the OPA through the 3
June Direction. On the same day, the OPA released version 1.5 of the FIT Rules
implementing this direction.4°”

(ii) Claimant's objections in respect of the Bruce to Milton allocation process

627. The Tribunal will first review Mesa’s objections in respect of the allocation process (i). It
will then focus on whether the process was designed to benefit particular FIT Applicants
to the detriment of others (ii).

i. Allocation of capacity in the Bruce Region

628. The Claimant argues that the following acts of the Ministry violated Article 1105: the
decision not to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line through a “full” ECT process
(a. below); and the decision to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line through a
“regional” ECT process rather than a special TAT (b. below). It also argues that the
process ultimately used to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line violated Article
1105 (c. below).

a. The decision not to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line through a “full”
ECT

629. The Claimant challenges the Ministry's decision not to run a full ECT.* It complains that
despite its repeated assurances, the ECT was never conducted.

It is true that the FIT Program originally contemplated an ECT in order to determine
whether and where to build up further transmission capacity for the FIT Program.
However, as has been noted earlier, much had changed in the Ontario electricity market
since the conception of the FIT Program. It is in these changed circumstances as they
were identified in a foregoing section that the Ministry decided not to carry out an ECT.
This being so, it sought, however, to design a regional ECT-like process that would be
as close as possible to the province-wide allocation initially envisaged.*°° The Tribunal
does not deem this decision incompatible with the guarantee of Article 1105. Indeed, the
Ministry took its decision in light of the prevailing circumstances based on reasonable

and rational considerations.

b. The decision to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line through a
“regional” ECT process rather than a special TAT

. The Claimant next argues that the Ministry's decision to allocate the Bruce to Milton

capacity through a regional ECT process rather than through the special TAT process
proposed by the OPA violated Article 1105.47°

From its submissions, it is clear that Mesa would have preferred the Government to
adopt the special TAT approach over the regional ECT that eventually prevailed. But as
already emphasized on several occasions in this Award, it is not for this Tribunal to
second-guess a government's policy choices, or to ascertain whether the policy goals of
the government would have been better served by resorting to other means. The
Tribunal’s task is only to determine whether the Government has breached Article 1105

by following the policy in question.

In the present case, the Tribunal can see nothing arbitrary or otherwise in breach of the
Article 1105 standard about the Ministry's decision to adopt a regional ECT rather than
a special TAT process.

409 See, e.g., Exh. R-182, Draft Ontario Power Authority Presentation, “Economic Connection Test
(ECT) Moving Forward” (1 March 2011) (reflecting the various policy considerations and decisions
needing to be made, and the extensive discussions that took place, with respect to allocating capacity
on the Bruce-to-Milton Line); Exh. C-438, OPA Presentation, Economic Connection Test (ECT) &
Program Evolution (21 March 2011) and Exh. R-183, Ontario Ministry of Energy Presentation, “DRAFT
KC and Future FIT Accommodation on Near-Term Transmission Projects” (21 March 2011) (both

637.

Once capacity became available in the Bruce Region because of the Bruce to Milton
Line, the question before the Ministry was how to allocate this capacity. Three options
were under consideration: (1) continuing with the ECT as originally designed; or (2)
adopting the proposal drawn up by the Ministry; or (3) resorting to a proposal prepared
by the OPA.‘"' The proposals of the Ministry and of the OPA were similar in most
respects.*1?

As time progressed, the OPA became concerned about its ability to complete the
process which it had proposed.*’® As a result, it proposed a new "special TAT/DAT"
process under which contracts would be awarded on the basis of the connection points
identified in their original applications. The OPA would re-run the TAT process but only
for the Bruce and West of London regions. The process would not involve changes in
connection points or generator paid upgrades, and would be fast and straightforward
from an implementation perspective.‘"* This, however, required amendments to the FIT
Rules.4'° As an additional drawback, it did not conform to the expectations of FIT

Applicants on how the Bruce to Milton capacity would be awarded.‘*®

Ultimately, the Ministry found it preferable to respect the expectations of FIT Applicants
by allocating the available capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line through a process as
close as possible to the ECT process originally provided in the FIT Rules.*"” The Ministry
thus chose to adopt a regional ECT process which would include connection point
changes and generator paid upgrades. In so doing, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the
Ministry did not act in a manner that could be deemed contrary to Article 1105.

c. The process ultimately used to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line

The Claimant also claims that the actual allocation process was “materially different from
the ECT process established in the FIT Rules” and violated Article 1105.4"* In particular,

the Claimant's objections target the following features of the process eventually chosen
by the Ministry: the process allowed connection point changes in a wide range of
circumstances (1);‘"° allowed connection point changes between regions (2);47° it
allowed enabler requested projects to select a connection point (3);42" it allowed
generator paid upgrades (4); it did not include a step to assess the feasibility of
expansions to the transmission system (5);4#? it established a cap on the capacity that
would be procured (6);4° and it allowed for a five day connection point change window
(7).4%4 The Claimant also submits that the 3 June Direction was issued without sufficient
advance notice and without consultation (8). Each of these objections is considered in
turn.

1. Connection point changes in a wide range of circumstances

The Claimant contends that the FIT Rules only allowed distribution projects to change
connection points prior to an ECT.475 Through the 3 June 2011 Direction, however, this
possibility was extended to transmission projects.

It is correct that the FIT Rules expressly provided that distribution connected projects
could change their connection points prior to an ECT.*7° However, the FIT Applicants
and the OPA did not understand this to exclude transmission projects from the change
of connection points. Indeed, in numerous presentations, the OPA conveyed to the FIT
Applicants that a// applicants would be given an opportunity to change their connection
points prior to an ECT.‘2’ As an illustration, the OPA presentation of 23 March 2010
provided so in the following language:

excerpt, “Priority ranking for first-round FIT Contracts posted” (21 December 2010) (“FIT applicants will
have the opportunity to request a change of connection point prior to the ECT. Connection point
changes could impact the ECT outcome for other applicants requesting a nearby connection point.”).

162

“After an applicant receives a TAT result, they [sic] may request a change of
connection point for their project.”426

640. Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot accept the Claimant's argument that the 3 June
Direction introduced a new process not contemplated in the existing FIT framework by
allowing transmission connected projects to change their connection points.

2. Connection point changes between regions

641.

In this context, the Claimant contends that the 3 June Direction allowed connection point
changes from West of London to Bruce, as a result of lobbying efforts by NextEra.‘°
According to Mesa, connection point changes should have been allowed from all nearby
regions and the fact that changes were limited to the Bruce and West of London region
was for NextEra’s benefit.4%°

642. The Tribunal cannot accept this line of argument. As was seen above, the FIT Rules
always contemplated that applicants could change their connection points‘*" without
regional limitations.**? As Mr. Chow testified, it would make no sense electrically to limit
changes to one region only:4°?

“At no time did we ever say [that connection point changes during the ECT
were to be limited by region] electrically it would have made no sense
whatsoever. If an applicant was close to the border of two regions, it would
make no sense to prohibit it from changing its connection point to go one
way merely because of a line drawn by the OPA solely for planning
purposes.”

In support of its argument, the Claimant refers to an OPA presentation dated 19 May
2010, which, so it says, provides that connection point changes would only be “allowed
within a region, not between regions.”* The presentation makes no such statement.4°5
In fact, the word “region” does not even appear in the presentation.

The Claimant also relies on the word “region” as it appears in section 5.1(b) and 5.4(a)
of the FIT Rules.*2° However, as Mr. Chow testified, those provisions relate to the OPA’s
division of the province of Ontario into separate regions for planning and communication
purposes. They do not contemplate the division of the province into electrical regions for
the purposes of an ECT.*9”

Finally, the Claimant has in any event not established how it was prejudiced by the 3
June Direction limiting connection point changes to projects in the Bruce and West of
London regions. Indeed, if projects located outside these two regions had been permitted
to connect to these two regions, then the Claimant’s projects would have faced even
greater competition.

3. Connection point changes for enabler requested projects

The next objection raised by the Claimant is that the 3 June Direction allowed a
proponent who previously asked to be “enabler requested”4** to choose a specific
connection point, which was not provided in the FIT Rules.4°°

This objection is not well-founded either. While the FIT Rules did not expressly provide
for connection point changes for enabler requested projects, there was nothing in the
FIT Rules that prohibited them.“*° As Jim MacDougall, manager of the FIT Program at
the OPA from July 2009 to June 2011 stated in his oral testimony, “if it is not prohibited

Process”. See slides 39, 46, 48, and 97 which refer to the option to change connection points but never

438 In their applications, applicants could either indicate a specific connection point, or indicate that they
were “enabler requested” i.e. that the applicants would pool together with other nearby projects to form
an “enabler” facility that would itself connect to the grid. See Chow WS | §23; Exh. R-002, FIT Program
Overview, v. 1.1, pp. 18-19.

then people can do it.”“41 Further, as Canada pointed out, not every aspect of the FIT
Program was detailed in the Rules. For instance, the method of carrying out the ECT
itself was not prescribed in the Rules.*#? Moreover, the OPA’s presentations highlighted
the possibility for all projects to change their connection points. This was reiterated in
the TAT priority rankings of 21 December 2010, which indicated that all projects listed
there would be able to change their connection points without distinguishing between
enabler requested projects and others.

4. Generator paid upgrades

648. The Claimant also asserts that allowing generator paid upgrades as part of the allocation
of capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line violated Canada’s obligations under NAFTA.“4?
The Tribunal notes that generator paid upgrades had always been part of the ECT
process.‘“* Hence, the 3 June Direction introduced nothing new in this respect. The
Claimant’s objection must accordingly be dismissed.

5. Feasibility of expansion to the transmission system

649. The Claimant sees another violation of Article 1105 in the fact that, unlike an ECT, the
Bruce to Milton allocation “did not include a phase for proposing and assessing new
expansions to the transmission system to accommodate additional FIT projects.”44° It
has, however, provided no factual basis or legal arguments in support of this claim. It
follows that the Tribunal cannot but dismiss this objection as insufficiently pled.

650. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal nevertheless notes that the purpose of the
second phase of the ECT was to identify any transmission construction projects that

441 Tr. (28 October 2014) 301:16-22 (“[T]here was no explicit restriction on how connection point

contract, if its — if it is not prohibited, then people can do it.”).

would be worthwhile from an economic perspective.““* The LTEP had already identified
the transmission projects which the Government considered to be economically
suitable.**” None of these projects were located in the Bruce Region. Indeed, once the
Bruce to Milton Line would be in operation, no other transmission project would be
economically justified in the region - a fact that was known.“® As a result, the second
phase of the ECT would have been unnecessary.

6. Cap on the amount of capacity

. The Claimant also challenges the Government's decision to place a cap on the amount

of electricity to be procured from the Bruce Region. It contends that the cap was contrary
to the expectations of FIT Applicants to whom the Ministry had promised that all available
capacity would be awarded.“*9

The Tribunal has already explained the changed circumstances which gave rise to the
LTEP and the 2011 Supply Mix Directive. These texts required Ontario to procure no
more than 10,700 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2018. This target was based on
the planned transmission expansion, the overall demand for electricity, and the ability to
integrate renewables into the system.*%°

On this basis, on 17 February 2011, the Ministry directed the OPA to plan for a
generating capacity of renewable energy amounting to 10,700 MW. Further, in the 3
June Direction, the Government directed the OPA to reserve 750 MW of transmission
capacity in the Bruce Region. The figure of 750 MW was based inter alia on the
renewable energy target laid down in the LTEP, which itself reflected the province’s
needs in terms of supply and demand of renewable energy.

The Claimant also challenges the fact that Ontario only awarded 300 MW of capacity in
the West of London region, although 550 MW capacity was available there. For Mesa, if

more capacity had been awarded in West of London, “some high-ranked projects that

displaced Bruce region projects would not have switched regions.” The Claimant,
however, has furnished the Tribunal with no evidence in support of this allegation.

Therefore, and in all the circumstances, the Tribunal cannot accept the Claimant's
submission that the Ministry's decision to cap the amount of electricity to be procured
from the Bruce Region was in breach of Article 1105.

7. Five day connection point change window

Mesa further objects that the connection point change window adopted by the 3 June
Direction was a “sudden, significant, and arbitrary’45' departure from the established FIT
process, a departure that violated Article 1105.‘** For the following reasons, the Tribunal
has a different assessment of the facts at issue.

First, in respect of the connection point change window process itself, the FIT Rules
specifically provided that projects would have the opportunity to change their connection
point prior to an ECT. This was also the understanding of the FIT Applicants at the time,
including the Claimant. In a press release of 23 December 2010, the Claimant
acknowledged that it expected that the transmission capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line
would be made available to “all wind projects in the western region of Ontario.”4°° In
other words, Mesa was itself aware that the Bruce to Milton capacity would be available
to applicants outside the Bruce Region through a process that would allow applicants to
change their connection points. Hence, the Tribunal cannot agree with the Claimant that
Ontario’s decision to allocate the Bruce to Milton Line capacity through a regional ECT-
like process was “arbitrary and unfair.”454

Second, in respect to the length of the window to change connection points, the Tribunal
recalls that, under the original FIT framework, the ECT was to be conducted in August
2010. This process would have involved a period of three weeks for FIT Applicants to

167

change their connection points. Applicants thus were preparing for this opportunity at
least since August 2010.

659. However, for the reasons mentioned above (§§621 et. seq.), the Government decided
not to conduct an ECT. Applicants nevertheless had an expectation that the Government
would permit them to change their connection points prior to allocating capacity on the
Bruce to Milton Line. The Canadian Wind Energy Association (“CanWEA’) for instance

wrote to the Minister of Energy expressing this expectation in the following terms:

“CanWEA is writing to express the view of a majority of our members that
the Government of Ontario and the Ontario Power Authority (OPA) should
follow through with the established Feed In Tariff (FIT) process by
immediately opening the window for point of interconnection changes to
enable the next round of FIT contracts to be issued in June of this year.

As you know, developers were told by the OPA on numerous occasions that
the opportunity would exist to change their point of interconnections before
the running of the Economic Connection Test (ECT) and the awarding of
contracts. We are asking that the OPA follow the process and provide this
opportunity.”45

660. CanWEA further advised the Government that, because the necessary background work
had been done, a short window for connection changes would be sufficient:

“Over the past several months, our members have collectively invested
significant time and money to prepare their respective interconnection
strategies. Once the updated Transmission Availability Tables are made
available our members can be ready to act quickly and respond within the
window of time communicated to our members by the OPA. For these
reasons, a majority of our members believe the window only needs to be
open for a short period of time.”45°

661. In line with CanWEA’s representation, the 3 June Direction provided for a short period
of five days to change connection points. The Government's decision to limit the
connection point change window appears thus in conformity with the needs of the
industry. While the Claimant submits that the CANWEA letter is “unavailing”,*”

CANWEA does represent the interests of several FIT applicants.

Energy (27 May 2011).

662. In fact, while the Claimant objected to the connection point change itself,** it did not
object to the five-day window at the time. On 2 June 2011, Brian Case, the Director of
the TTD and Arran projects, learned about the five-day connection point window through

an email message received from an industry colleague:

“Connection point change — which the gov't was contemplating not moving
forward with two weeks ago, has made a comeback. The window shall be
open for 5 business days beginning next week or the week after as opposed
to the 30 days originally outlined.”4°°

663. There is no indication on record that Mr. Case reacted negatively to this information.

66.

&

In reality, it is not surprising that Mesa did not protest against the shortness of the window
at the time. Indeed, a short window reduced the potential for projects outside the Bruce
Region to connect into the region. Hence, rather than being detrimental, if anything this
change was beneficial to Mesa’s project.

665. In the circumstances, the Tribunal is of the view that, by allowing a five-day connection

point change window, the Government did not breach Article 1105.

8. Advance Notice and Prior Consultation

666. Finally, Mesa contends that the 3 June Direction was issued with “inadequate” advance
notice and without prior consultation, which was “arbitrary and capricious” and “contrary
to expectations”,*©° thereby breaching Article 1105.‘°" If the Ministry had followed OPA'’s
practice of consulting with FIT Applicants, so says the Claimant, “there may not have
been a rule change.“ On its part, the Respondent counters that the lack of consultation

did not cause any harm to Mesa.

(an outside consultant who submitted the TTD and Arran FIT applications) wrote to Mr. Robertson,

It is true that the 3 June Direction was issued on a Friday. It notified FIT Applicants that
the connection point change window would open for five days from the following Monday,
ie. 6 June. The Respondent's witness, Mr. MacDougall admitted that this was
inadequate*® and Ms. Lo explained that the Ministry was in a hurry to award contracts
because of political considerations.4*

Be that as it may, the Tribunal recalls that FIT Applicants were expecting a connection
point change window since at least August 2010. The Respondent’s witness Ms. Lo
accepted that the connection point change could have been anticipated.‘°° Moreover,
although the decision to allocate capacity in the manner specified in the 3 June Direction
appears to have been taken nearly three weeks earlier on 12 May 2011,‘ subsequent
correspondence between the Ministry and the OPA shows that discussions on the
connection point change window were still ongoing on 20 May 2011.46” On 27 May 2011,
ie. just one week before the 3 June Direction, CanWEA informed the Ministry that its
members were expecting a connection point amendment window.*® 39 applicants
actually changed their connection points during the window.‘® Furthermore, it is not the
Claimant’s case that it was unable to change its own connection points because of the
short notice. In other words, the Claimant does not allege that it was prejudiced by the
short notice.

As a consequence, the Tribunal finds that the acts complained of here do not rise to the
level required for a breach of Article 1105.

In conclusion, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimant's various objections in respect of the
process adopted by the Ministry to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line. The
Tribunal will now proceed to examine whether the Ministry developed this process in the
interest of particular FIT Applicants.

ii. | Benefit to particular FIT Applicants

The Claimant submits that because of “irrelevant considerations arising from
electioneering, politicization, or favoritism”, other applicants to the FIT Program including
NextEra Energy and International Power Canada received better treatment than
Mesa,‘” thereby depriving the Claimant of a FIT Contract which otherwise it would have
been awarded.‘”' For the Claimant, on the basis of advance information, its competitors
caused the Ministry to modify the FIT framework in their favor and to Mesa’s detriment.
The information at issue was not available generally; in supplying it to certain of its
competitors, the Claimant submits that the Respondent acted “profoundly unfairly.”4”2 It
summarizes its objections as follows:

“The Ministry had access to confidential rankings of FIT applicants to see
how contracts would be given and how changes would affect applicants.
With Ontario knowing this information, one applicant, NextEra, was given
access to high level government officials and succeeded in lobbying for a
FIT rule change while at the same time receiving prior knowledge of the
change. Perhaps most disturbingly, as was revealed at the hearing, blatant
protection was afforded to International Power Canada, a Canadian
company whose executive leadership at the time was a well-known political
backer of the Ontario Liberal government. The result was a capriciously
misapplied process contaminated by selective and improper investor
protection, a lack of minimal due process, and a complete lack of
transparency and candor. This culminated in a significant rule change that
was decided without any consultation with stakeholders, and literally was
given a weekend's advance notice.”4”

The Tribunal has already reviewed the circumstances in which the 3 June Direction was
issued. It has found that the direction was based on rational considerations responding
to the situation prevailing at the time in Ontario. The Tribunal cannot discern in this
factual matrix the “patent abuse of governmental and regulatory authority” alleged by the
Claimant. The 3 June Direction may have favored a few applicants, but that was the
outcome of the rational policy adopted by the Government, a policy and an outcome that
the Tribunal does not fault.

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the evidence presented by the Claimant in support
of its allegations that the 3 June Direction and the accompanying changes in the FIT

677.

Rules “systematically benefited” NextEra, and were “specifically designed with NextEra
in mind”.4”4 It comes to the conclusion that the Claimant has not been able to establish
its case, which relies largely on conjecture. In the following paragraph, the Tribunal will
address the most relevant evidence cited by Mesa in support of its case and explain why
such evidence does not substantiate the Claimant's allegations.

The Claimant first points to a “dry run” which the OPA conducted, in the course of
deciding which of the three proposals to follow for allocating capacity on the Bruce to
Milton Line.*”° As this test showed that only one NextEra project would receive a FIT
Contract under this approach, so argues the Claimant, the Ministry chose a different
approach, i.e. the regional ECT eventually followed, to ensure that specific proponents,
including NextEra, would be favored.*”°

It is correct that the OPA conducted a dry run to determine the capacity that would be
awarded as part of the Bruce to Milton allocation if the preferred approach were that of
a special TAT. The reason why the Government eventually chose the regional ECT has
already been explained above. The choice was dictated by the fact that the special TAT
required an amendment of the FIT Rules and would have been contrary to the
expectations of the FIT Applicants.

The Claimant has not established that the decision not to follow the special TAT process
was motivated by an intention to benefit NextEra. The Claimant has not established
either that the results of the dry run were known to NextEra. Nor are there indications on
record allowing the Tribunal to reasonably infer that NextEra exerted influence on
Ministry officials to induce them to adopt a specific process. Indeed, it appears that the
results of the dry run were shared only with certain Ministry officials, and not with any of
the individuals who allegedly influenced Ministry officials.4””

In support its arguments, the Claimant also refers to several alleged meetings between
Ministry representatives and NextEra, explaining particularly that NextEra had advance
notice of the Ministry's decision to alter the process for allocating capacity on the Bruce

to Milton Line and of the 3 June Direction.‘”® Specifically, it cites a meeting held on 11
May 2011 between NextEra’s Senior Vice President Al Wiley and Andrew Mitchell,
Director of Policy at the Ministry of Energy. It alleges that after that meeting a decision
was taken to amend the capacity allocation process on the Bruce to Milton Line in a
manner that would favor NextEra.*”° It is correct that on the day following the meeting
with NextEra, the Ministry appears to have decided to adopt the regional ECT approach
instead of the special TAT process. However, as mentioned earlier, subsequent
correspondence between the Ministry and the OPA shows that discussions on the
connection point change window were still ongoing on 20 May 2011.48

678. The fact that NextEra representatives met with Ministry officials does not in and of itself
lead to the conclusion that the Ministry’s decision and the 3 June Direction were the
product of that meeting. As several witnesses confirmed, officials from the Ministry and
the OPA regularly met with numerous FIT Applicants throughout the relevant period.“*'
Indeed, the email relied upon by the Claimant in support of its argument merely
demonstrates that no decision had been made yet on the connection point change
window.“ While the Claimant has certainly proven that meetings were held between
NextEra and the Ministry, it has not established that the content of these meetings
differed in any relevant manner from the many meetings which the Ministry conducted
in the normal course with investors in the FIT Program.

679. The Claimant also submits that because NextEra made significant changes to its
connection points within the five-day window, the Tribunal should assume that it had
prior knowledge of the 3 June Direction. As was established earlier, the FIT Applicants
were expecting a connection point change since at least August 2010. They knew their
FIT provincial priority ranking as well as the connection points of every project since
21 December 2010.*®° Thus, applicants had all the information needed to determine

482 See PHB fn. 412 relying on an email exchange between Ministry of Energy and NextEra (Exh. C-
0090) and stating that the facts contained therein were not notified to other FIT applicants. However,
that exchange merely notes the discussions at the Ministry at the time “a decision has not been made
yet on whether or not to open the POI [point of interconnection] amendment window, and whether, if
so, to do so province-wide or just for Bruce-to-Milton and West of London.”

whether to change their connection point*®* and do the necessary preparatory work. In
November 2010, Ortech, a consulting firm in Ontario, advised FIT Applicants that the
connection point change window would be limited and that projects in need of assistance
on such change should initiate the process early.*®° Moreover, in the absence of any
convincing evidence, the Tribunal cannot simply assume that NextEra had advance
notice of the 3 June Direction because it changed its connection points during the five-
day change window.

680. The Claimant has made several other unsupported allegations. For instance, it submits
that the 3 June Direction was intended to favor NextEra because “around the time of the
June 3, 2011 rule changes”, NextEra made “the maximum donation amount permitted
under Ontario law” to the governing Liberal Party.*® It also argues that NextEra “gained
assistance through the Ontario Premier's office” and that “the Minister of Energy's Office
took explicit steps to ensure the process was being executed to the benefit of NextEra”,
citing to an irrelevant meeting note. None of these allegations is supported by cogent
evidence. In the circumstances, the facts so alleged have simply not been established.

68

. The Tribunal notes that Mesa also claims that the Respondent breached the full
protection and security component of Article 1105. It pleads that “the obligation of full
protection and security, which is an integral part of NAFTA 1105, requires Canada to
exercise due diligence that the treatment of the investor by the OPA does not undermine
the protection of a stable, transparent, non-arbitrary regulatory framework.”4®” The facts
invoked for this claim are the same as those considered above. As a result, the Tribunal
cannot but dismiss this claim as well.

682. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that
Canada’s conduct has not breached Article 1105. While reaching this conclusion, the
Tribunal nevertheless notes that at least some criticism may be levelled at Ontario’s
decision to run two renewable energy programs in parallel without clearly articulating the
relationship of the two and without spelling out their interaction in the event of shifts in
demand and supply and other changes in the energy market. In the event, this choice
and the manner in which it was implemented created certain problems, and might well

have been handled differently. But judged in all the circumstances, this is not criticism
that reaches the threshold of a violation of Canada’s international obligations.

vi. COSTS

A. BACKGROUND

683. As mentioned above (§§189-190), the Parties filed cost submissions on 3 March 2015
(“Clai 's Costs Submission’, “R dent’s Costs ission”) and replies on

 

26 March 2015 (“Claimant’s Reply on Costs” and “Respondent’s Reply on Costs”).

B. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

1. The Claimant’s Position

684. The Claimant submits that “Canada’s conduct has caused unjustifiable inefficiencies in
these proceedings resulting in longer delays and increased workloads for both the
Investor and the Tribunal. In these instances, costs should be assessed against Canada
to address actions that imposed unnecessary burden on the Tribunal and the
Investor.”48° The Claimant therefore requests the Tribunal to order the Respondent to
bear the costs of this arbitration, as well its costs of legal representation and assistance,
which together amount to US$ 9,306,156.02.

685. The Claimant further submits that even if it were not to prevail on any claim, it should still
be awarded the costs it has incurred on account of “Canada’s conduct and vexatious
argumentation”.*®° In particular it points to Canada’s failure to produce documents in a
timely manner and to the “meritless” subsidy defense advanced by Canada. It quantifies
these costs as 30% of its overall legal fees, i.e. US$ 2,791,847.

686. Finally, the Claimant submits that there are several reasons why, even if it is eventually
unsuccessful, it should still not have to bear Canada’s arbitration or representation costs.
It stresses that several aspects of its claim were novel and that there was no
unreasonable or wasteful conduct on its part.

2. The Respondent’s Position

687. The Respondent contends that Mesa’s claims were speculative, unreasonable and
based on a “meritless interpretation of the NAFTA”.4°° For these reasons and to provide
reparation to Canada and dissuade similarly frivolous and meritless claims, the
Respondent should be granted all of its costs in this arbitration.

688. The Respondent also submits that the Claimant pursued the arbitration in an “inefficient
and needlessly complex way that [...] wasted time and money”.**" In particular, it points
out that the Claimant “(1) failed to respect NAFTA’s 6-month cooling-off period, (2)
engaged in unauthorized and excessively burdensome fishing expeditions for
documents, (3) ignored the Tribunal’s rulings and procedures on confidentiality, (4) filed
unnecessary and duplicative procedural requests, (5) consistently disrespected the
Tribunal’s rules on the number of submissions permitted on procedural requests, (6)
sought to prejudice Canada with untimely, last-minute submissions of exhibits, (7) failed
to clarify whether it was continuing to pursue certain claims based on measures of the
[OPA], (8) presented circular arguments on the nature of the FIT Program that led to
unnecessary disputes, and (9) conducted unnecessary cross-examinations on irrelevant
issues at the hearing.”492

689. For all of these reasons, the Tribunal should award the Respondent all of its costs in this
arbitration. These include its arbitration costs and its costs for legal representation and
assistance, the latter of which amount to CAD 6,109,001.95.

C. ANALYSIS
690. The Tribunal will first detail the arbitration costs and the costs incurred by the Parties (1).

It will then set out the applicable legal framework (2) and determine the apportionment
of costs (3).

Costs

691. The Claimant has made advances towards costs in the amount of CAD 1,116,000 and

692.

the Respondent in the amount of CAD 1,116,000, which gives a total advance of CAD
2,232,000 (equivalent to EUR 1,551,343.80 as converted to Euros upon receipt by the
PCA).

The rates for time spent by the Tribunal and Secretary on this case were set in §23.1 of
PO 1 (USD 550 per hour for the Arbitrators and USD 280 per hour for the Secretary, all
exclusive of VAT). Computed at these rates, and as converted to Euros for payment by
the PCA, the fees of the members of the Tribunal amount to: The Honorable Charles N.
Brower EUR 317,369.32; Toby Landau, QC EUR 221,758.57; and Prof. Gabrielle
Kaufmann-Kohler EUR 508,153.14. The fees of the Secretary of the Tribunal amount to
EUR 211,899.78. Accordingly, the total fees accrued for the Tribunal and the Secretary
(which are hereby fixed pursuant to Article 39 of the UNCITRAL Rules) amount to EUR
1,259,180.81. Compared to the time actually spent, these fees were reduced in order
not to exceed the advance available after the last call. The PCA will shortly provide the
Parties with a final statement of account.

693. The PCA has charged fees in the amount of EUR 37,455 for the administration of the

case and its registry services. Other costs amount to EUR 254,707.99.

694. The total costs of the proceedings are thus EUR 1,551,343.80.

695.

The Claimant's costs for legal representation and assistance amount to
US$ 8,518,585.474°° while the Respondent’s costs amount to CAD 6,109,001.95.
Considering the complexity of these proceedings, both these amounts appear

reasonable.*

493 This is the total amount of costs claimed by the Claimant (US$ 9,306,156.02) less the “fees paid to
the Tribunal” (US$ 787,570.55).

494 The Claimant agrees that the Respondent's costs for legal representation and assistance are
reasonable. See Claimant's Reply on Costs §11 (“The number of hours of legal work provided by both
parties is relatively similar and reasonable given the complexity of these proceedings. Similarly, the
costs for expert witnesses are similar and reasonable in the circumstances”.).

2. Applicable Legal Framework

696. Article 1135(1) of the NAFTA provides that a NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunal may award
costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules. As mentioned above, the 1976
UNCITRAL Rules apply in the present proceeding.

697. Article 38 of these Rules provides that the Tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its
award. It also provides a list of items that may be claimed which include the fees and
expenses of the Tribunal and the reasonable costs for legal representation and
assistance of the successful party.

698. Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules contains rules for the allocation of costs:

“4. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle
be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may
apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that
apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the

case.
2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to
in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the
circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear
such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines
that apportionment is reasonable.”
3. Allocation of Costs
(a) Arbitration Costs
699. Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the unsuccessful party shall “in

principle” bear all of the costs of the arbitration. The Claimant too agrees that, in general,
costs should follow the outcome of the case.‘

178

700. The Respondent has prevailed in the present proceedings and the Tribunal sees no
reason to depart from the general rule set in Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.
Indeed, it finds it fair and appropriate that the Claimant bear the entire costs of the
arbitration, i.e. EUR 1,551,343.80.

(b) Costs of Legal Representation and Assistance

701.

Unlike the position on arbitration costs, the UNCITRAL Rules do not contain a
presumption for awarding costs of legal representation and other party costs to the
successful party. Rather, they provide that in apportioning these costs, the arbitral
tribunal should consider “the circumstances of the case”. Doing so, NAFTA tribunals
have taken several factors into account including an overall view of the case, the novelty
of the case, and the parties’ conduct throughout the case.*°°

702. Here, each Party complains of the conduct of the other which, so each says, led to an
increase in costs. Each of them also provides explanations to justify its own conduct
complained of by the other.

703. The Tribunal recalls that the Claimant advanced a large number of procedural requests
in the course of this arbitration. While it was its right to do so, many of these requests
unnecessarily burdened the arbitral process and were decided against the Claimant.‘°”
Further, many “confidential” and “restricted access” designations applied by the
Claimant and contested by the Respondent were later voluntarily withdrawn.*9® The
Claimant also filed proceedings under Section 1782 of the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure in various U.S. courts before the constitution of the Tribunal (but after the
filing of its Notice of Arbitration). It also sought to make additional Section 1782 requests

496 See, for instance, Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada (UNCITRAL), Award in Respect of
Costs, 26 November 2002, §17 (Investor's Reply Statement of Costs Schedule of Documents at Tab-
01); S.D. Myers v. Government of Canada (UNCITRAL), Final Award (concerning the apportionment of
the costs between the Disputing Parties), 30 December 2002, §49 (Investor's Statement of Costs
Schedule of Documents at Tab-01); Azinian §§125-126.

497 See, for instance PO 4 in which the Tribunal rejected the Claimant's request to amend the procedural
calendar on the basis that the Claimant had failed to make our any compelling reason to revisit the
calendar that had been previously adopted; PO 6, PO 11 in which other procedural requests made by
the Claimant were rejected.

498 The Respondent contends that it challenged 458 confidentiality designations made by the Claimant,
of which 210 designations were voluntarily withdrawn by the Claimant (Respondent's Statement of
Costs §18). The Claimant has not denied this submission.

while the arbitration was ongoing. All of this created a number of procedural difficulties

that might have been avoided.

At the same time, it is true that the matters in controversy were genuinely complex and

that Mesa’s claims raised in part difficult factual and legal issues, the outcome of which

was uncertain. In other words, this was a legitimate dispute.

Taking all of these aspects into account, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant
should bear all of its own costs, and 30% of Canada’s costs in an amount of CAD
1,832,701.
DECISION

For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:

vi.

vii.

Decides that it has jurisdiction over the claims brought in the present
proceedings, excluding the claims for breaches that occurred prior to the

Claimant’s investment in Canada;

Decides that these claims are admissible;

Decides that, by reason of Articles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b) of the NAFTA, the
Claimant's claims under Articles 1102, 1103 and 1104 of the NAFTA must be
dismissed;

Decides that the Respondent has not acted in breach of Article 1105 of NAFTA;
Fixes the costs of the arbitration at EUR 1,551,343.80;

Decides that the Claimant shall bear 100% of the arbitration costs fixed in the
preceding paragraph and thus orders the Claimant to pay CAD 1,116,000 to the
Respondent within 30 days of notification of this award;

Decides that the Claimant shall bear 30% of the Respondent’s costs and thus

orders the Claimant to pay CAD 1,832,701 to the Respondent within 30 days of
notification of this award;

180

viii. All other claims are dismissed.

All these decisions are unanimous, except for those set forth in subparagraphs (iii) and (iv),
which are made by majority.
