INTRODUCTION
The Parties

The Claimants are Watkins Holdings S.a 1.1. (the “First Claimant’), a private limited
liability company incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg; Watkins (Ned) BV (the
“Second Claimant”), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the First Claimant; Watkins Spain, S.L.
(the “Third Claimant”), a private limited liability company incorporated under the
laws of Spain; Redpier, S.L. (the “Fourth Claimant’), a private limited liability
company incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg; Northsea Spain S.L. (the “Fifth
Claimant”); Parque Edlico Marmellar, S.L. (the “Sixth Claimant”); and Parque Eélico
La Boga, S.L. (the “Seventh Claimant”), all three are private limited liability
companies incorporated under the laws of Spain. The seven companies are collectively
referred to as “Watkins” or the “Claimants.” The Claimants are represented in these
proceedings by Mses. Virginia Allan, Marie Stoyanov, and Agustina Alvarez, and
Messrs. David Ingle, Pablo Torres and Antonio Vazquez-Guillen of Allen & Overy
LLP.

The Respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain” or the “Respondent,” and,
collectively with the Claimants, the “Parties”). The Respondent is represented in these
proceedings by Mses. Ménica Moraleda Saceda, Elena Ofioro Sainz, Amaia Rivas
Kortazar, Patricia Froehlingsdorf Nicolas, Gloria de la Guardia Limeres, and Ana Maria
Rodriguez Esquivias, and Messrs. Antolin Fernandez Antufia, Diego Santacruz
Descartin, Javier Torres Gella, Javier Castro Lépez, Roberto Fernandez Castilla, and

Alvaro Navas Lépez of the Ministry of Justice of the Government of Spain.

Overview of the Dispute

This case relates to a dispute arising from the Claimants’ investment in the Spanish wind
generation sector and, in particular, the purchase of seven wind farm sites located in the
province of Castilla y Leén in Spain (“Wind Farms”). The Claimants allege that the
Respondent adopted measures radically modifying and dismantling the applicable legal

1

IL.

and economic regime for renewable energy (“RE”) projects on which the Claimants
relied on when making their investment. According to the Claimants, in adopting such

measures, Spain has breached its international obligations.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Initiation of the Arbitration Proceedings and Constitution of the Tribunal

On October 26, 2015, Watkins filed with the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes Centre (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) a request for arbitration against

Spain (the “Request for Arbitration”) accompanied by Exhibits C-1 to C-33.

The Request for Arbitration was made pursuant to the Energy Charter Treaty dated
December 17, 1994, which entered into force on April 16, 1998 with respect to Spain,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands (the “ECT”), and to the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated March 18,

1965, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the “ICSID Convention’).

On October 28, 2015, pursuant to Rule 5 of the Rules of Procedure for the Institution of
Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (“ICSID Institution Rules”), the Centre
acknowledged receipt of the Request for Arbitration, and, on October 29, 2015, it
transmitted a copy of the Request for Arbitration to Spain as well as to the Embassy of

Spain in Washington D.C.

On November 4, 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for
Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Institution
Rules 6 and 7 and notified the Parties of the registration. The Secretary-General invited
the Parties to proceed, as soon as possible, with the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal

pursuant to ICSID Institution Rule 7(d).

In accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Parties agreed that the

Arbitral Tribunal would comprise of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by the

Claimants, one arbitrator appointed by the Respondent, and a third, presiding arbitrator,

to be appointed by the Secretary-General of ICSID.

Accordingly, the Claimants appointed Dr. Michael C. Pryles AO PBM, an Australian
national, the Respondent appointed Prof. Dr. Héléne Ruiz Fabri, a French national and
pursuant to the Parties’ agreement, the Secretary-General of ICSID appointed Tan Sri
Dato’ Cecil W.M. Abraham, a Malaysian national, to serve as the President of the

Arbitral Tribunal.

On March 31, 2016, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that all three arbitrators
had accepted their appointments. The Arbitral Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) was thus
deemed to have been constituted and the proceeding to have begun as of that date
pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rules on Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the
“Arbitration Rules”). On the same date, Mr. Gonzalo Flores, ICSID Deputy Secretary-
General, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal with the assistance of

Ms. Ana Conover, ICSID Legal Associate.

First Session and Procedural Order No. 1

On May 23, 2016, the Tribunal held the first session by telephone conference. An audio
recording of the session was made and was distributed to the Parties as well as to the

Members of the Tribunal.

During the first session, the Tribunal and the Parties considered (i) the draft agenda and
the draft procedural order circulated by the Secretary of the Tribunal on April 6, 2016
and (ii) the Parties’ agreements and positions on the draft agenda and the draft
procedural order received on May 6, 2016. Among other items on the agenda, the
Parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration

Rules, and that they did not have any objections in this respect.

On May 26, 2016, the President of the Tribunal, on behalf of the Tribunal, issued
Procedural Order No. 1 embodying the Parties’ agreements on procedural matters and
the Tribunal’s decisions on the disputed issues. Procedural Order No. | provided, inter
alia, that (i) the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in force as of April 10,
2006; (ii) the place of the proceeding would be Washington, DC; and (iii) the procedural
languages would be English and Spanish. Procedural Order No. | also set out the

procedural calendar for the present proceeding.

On July 8, 2016, Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Acting Secretary-General, informed the Parties
that Ms. Ana Conover, ICSID Legal Associate, was designated to serve as Secretary of

the Tribunal in the present case.

Parties’ Written Pleadings and Procedural Requests

On November 14, 2016, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits (the
“Claimants’ Memorial”) in accordance with the procedural calendar. The Claimants’
Memorial was accompanied by Exhibits C-34 to C-173; Legal Authorities CL-1 to CL-
93; a Witness Statement by Mr. Felipe Moreno Zabala (the “First Moreno
Statement”); two Expert Reports by the Brattle Group, i.e. an Expert Report on
regulatory matters (the “First Brattle Regulatory Report”) and an Expert Report on
quantum (the “First Brattle Quantum Report”), supported, respectively, by Exhibits
BRR-1 to BRR-156 and BQR-1 to BQR-45. On December 5, 2016, the Claimants

submitted the corresponding translations into the other language of the proceeding.

On February 10, 2017, as provided in the procedural calendar, the Respondent filed its
Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction (the “Respondent’s
Counter-Memorial”) in Spanish. The Respondent’s Counter-Memorial was
accompanied by Exhibits R-1 to R-278; Legal Authorities RL-4 to RL-71; a Witness
Statement by Mr. Juan Ramén Ayuso (the “First Ayuso Statement”), along with
Exhibits W-01001-W-01013, W-01021-W-01035, W-01037, W-01043-W-01044, W-
01084-W-01085, W-01087, W01095, W-01101-W-01131, and W-01142; and an Expert
Report by Accuracy (the “First Accuracy Report”), supported by Exhibits ACQ-2 to

4

20.

21.

22.

ACQ-55. On March 2, 2017, the Respondent submitted the corresponding translations

into the other language of the proceeding.

On April 28, 2017, following exchanges between the Parties, and in accordance with
Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties jointly filed their document production applications

in the form of Redfern Schedules.

On May 16, 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, ruling on the Parties’
document production applications. Procedural Order No. 4 established, inter alia, that
(i) “the Parties shall produce the documents ordered by the Tribunal by June 9, 2017;”
and that (ii) the Respondent shall “elaborate on its objections to produce the minutes of
the Council of Ministers on the grounds of privilege and secrecy by 23 May 2017,” and
“the Claimants may submit a responsive submission within seven days upon receiving

the Respondent’s observations.”

On May 25, 2017, the Respondent requested an extension until May 29, 2017 to
elaborate on its objections to produce the minutes of the Council of Ministers on the
grounds of privilege and secrecy. The Tribunal granted the time extension on May 26,

2017.

On May 29, 2017, the Respondent submitted its comments as ordered in Procedural
Order No. 4 and pursuant to the extension granted by the Tribunal, along with three

supporting documents.

On June 5, 2017, in accordance with the time-limit set forth in Procedural Order No. 4,
the Claimants filed their observations to the Respondent’s objection to produce the

minutes of the Council of Ministers.

On June 15, 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 denying the Claimants’

request to produce the minutes of the Council of Ministers’ meetings, noting, inter alia,

 

that “they are secret, that no documentation reflecting the discussions held within the

Council of Ministers exists, and therefore the legal impediment in Article 9.2(b) of the
IBA Rules would apply.”

On August 25, 2017, Martina Polasek, the Acting Secretary-General, informed the
Parties that Ms. Catherine Kettlewell, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as

Secretary of the Tribunal in the present case.

On September 19, 2017, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had reached an
agreement to extend certain deadlines of the procedural calendar. On the same date, the

Tribunal confirmed the Parties’ agreement.

On September 28, 2017, the Claimants filed their Reply on the Merits and Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction (the “Claimants’ Reply”). The Claimants’ Reply was
accompanied by Appendices | to 6, Exhibits C-174 to C-265; Legal Authorities CL-94
to CL-159; a Witness Statement by Mr. Felipe Moreno Zabala (the “Second Moreno
Statement’); and two Expert Reports by the Brattle Group, on regulations (the “Second
Brattle Regulatory Report”) and on quantum (the “Second Brattle Quantum
Report”), with their respective Exhibits BRR-157 to BRR-266 and BQR-46 to BQR-
52. On October 18, 2017, the Claimants submitted the corresponding translations into

the other language of the proceeding.

On January 9, 2018, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on

the Parties’ agreement to extend the deadline.

On March 7, 2018, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (the “Claimants’
Rejoinder”) with two Appendices. On March 27, 2018, the Claimants submitted the

corresponding translations into the other language of the proceeding.

On May 7, 2018, the Parties exchanged their corresponding new document request
pursuant to Procedural Order No. 6. On May 9, 2018, each Party submitted to the
Tribunal the objections to the other Party’s request. On May 10, 2018, the Tribunal

The Non-Disputing Party Applications

On January 16, 2017, the European Commission (the “Commission’”) filed with the
Centre, an application for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party (the

“Commission’s Application”) pursuant to Arbitration Rule 37(2).

On January 18, 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on the Commission’s

Application.

On February 2, 2017, each Party filed their observations on the Commission’s
Application. The Claimants’ observations were accompanied by Attachments | to 3,
and the Respondent’s observations were accompanied by Legal Authorities RL-1 to RL-

3.

On March 21, 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 embodying the
Tribunal’s analysis of and decision on the Commission’s Application. Noting that
“[t]he Respondent in its [...] Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on
Jurisdiction [...] has raised two jurisdictional objections,” the Tribunal concluded that

the “Respondent would be able to argue the issue of jurisdiction.” However, observing

7

that the “Commission may have a particular knowledge or insight which may be of

assistance to the Tribunal in its consideration of the jurisdictional issue,” the Tribunal

decided that “it is appropriate for the Commission to intervene.

Accordingly, the Tribunal authorised the Commission to intervene as a non-disputing
party and “‘to file a written submission of not more than 30 pages by 3 April 2017.” The
Tribunal specified, inter alia, that such submission “shall set out all matters that the
Commission wishes to bring to the Tribunal’s attention regarding jurisdiction,” that
“[t]he Commission shall not attend or observe the hearings;” and, “as a condition for
being given leave to file a non-disputing party submissions,” the Commission was
required to “provide the Tribunal with a written undertaking [...] to pay the additional
costs of legal representation which may be reasonably incurred by the parties in

responding to the Commission’s Submissions.” Finally, the Tribunal invited the Parties

 

to “submit their observations on the Submission of the Commi.

18 April 2017.”

ion to the Tribunal by

 

On March 23, 2017, the Commission submitted a request for the Tribunal to reconsider
Procedural Order No. 2 “in so far as it require[d] the Commission to provide an
undertaking on costs, and to remove the procedural direction set out in paragraph 53(e)

thereof’ (the “Commission’s Request”).

On March 27, 2017, the Centre communicated the Commission’s Request to the Parties.
On the same date, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide their observations.
Furthermore, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the filing dates related to the
Commission’s written submission as set forth in Procedural Order No.2 were
suspended, and that it would notify the Commission and the Parties of the new filing

dates upon issuance of its decision on the Commission’s Request.

On April 7, 2017, the Claimants filed their observations on the Commission’s Request.

On April 10, 2017, the Respondent filed its observations on the Commission’s Request

and on the same date, ICSID transmitted the Parties’ observations to the Tribunal.

On April 27, 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 rejecting the
Commission’s Request to alter Procedural Order No. 2 and inviting the Commission, as
a condition for being given leave to file a non-disputing party submission, to provide
the cost undertaking as described in Procedural Order No. 2. Further, the Tribunal
updated the schedule pertaining to the filing of the Commission’s written submission,
indicating that (i) “the Commission may file its written submission by 26 May 2017;”
and that (ii) “the Parties shall present their observations on the Commission’s written

submission in their respective briefs.”

On May 2, 2017, the Commission informed the Tribunal that it would not provide the

undertaking on costs.

A. R dent’s R ble Energy R ‘y Fr k

71. — Spain’s development of RE dates back to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”), which was adopted on 9 May 1992 and entered into
force on 21 March 1994.7 The UNFCCC established a framework for inter-

governmental efforts to tackle climate change.

72. Spain’s commitments under the UNFCCC were expanded through the Kyoto Protocol,
negotiated in 1997 by the parties to the UNFCCC, which fixed upon its signatories
(including members states of the European Union) binding greenhouse gas emissions
targets. As such, the European Union set greenhouse gas emission targets for its member
states to align with the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol was signed
by Spain on 29 April 1998 and ratified on 31 May 2002. It entered into force on 16
February 2005.®

_

. Initial Framework
(a) Basic Feature

73. Spain’s Energy Policy (also referred as the Spanish Electrical System) is found in a

number of laws and regulations, which are as follows:?

qd) The Spanish Constitution of 1978, which is the supreme legislation of the
Spanish Legal System.

(2) Statute Law, which is of two kinds, namely: (a) organic law and (b) ordinary
laws.

(3) Royal Decree Law, which, as regulation, has the force of law. The
Constitution authorises the Spanish Government to approve Royal Decree

Law in situations of extraordinary need or urgency. The approval of

7 Exhibit C-36.
8 Exhibit C-37.

° Respondent's Counter-Memorial, {| 213.

Royal Decree Law is subject to strict conditions, controls, and limits and
requires subsequent Parliamentary validation.

(4) Royal Decree, which is a regulatory standard that emanates from the
Government. It complements or implements laws and is hierarchically
inferior to them.

(5) Ministerial Orders, which are a regulatory standard emanating from one or

several ministerial departments.
(b) Regulators

74. Regulators of Spain’s Energy Policy include, first, the Ministry of Industry, Energy and
Tourism, which has the primary responsibility for regulation of energy matters. Second,
the Secretary of State for Energy exercises specific responsibilities for energy policies.
Third, the Institute for Diversification and Saving of Electricity (“IDAE”) provides
advice to policymakers on technical and economic issues and drafting of legislations

and acts as a liaison between the Government and Industry.

75. Another relevant agency is the National Energy Commission (“CNE”),!° which
oversees competition in market settlement of regulated costs of the electricity system
and monitors the technical compliance of both conventional and renewable power
facilities. The CNE is now known as the National Commission on Markets and

Competition (“CNMC”).!!
(c) The 1997 Electricity Law (Law 54/1997)

76. On 27 November 1997, Spain adopted Law 54/1997 on the Electricity Sector (“1997
Electricity Law” or “Law 54/1997”), which partially opened up the electricity sector
to competition and put an end to the previous State-controlled system.!* Law 54/1997
set up the framework for various public authorities to exercise competence in Spain’s

electricity sector. In particular, and as mentioned above, within the central Government

'! Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, {| 229-231.
!? Law 54/1997 of 27 November 1997, Exhibit C-39.

the relevant public authorities would include the CNE and the Ministry of Industry,

Tourism and Commerce.'*

77. Among the objectives of the Law 54/1997 was the “promotion of renewable energy”
and for RE sources to “cover at least 12% of Spain’s total energy demand by the year

2010 [...1."

78. For the purposes of encouraging the production of energy from renewable sources, Law
54/1997 distinguished between an “Ordinary Regime” applicable to conventional
sources of energy—such as coal-fired power plants—and a “Special Regime”
applicable to energy production facilities of less than SOMW, which generated
electricity from “non-consumable renewable energy sources.” > Under the Special
Regime, electricity generators benefitted from a supplementary premium over and

above the market price.

79. Spain explains that the creation of a double regime stemmed from the “need to
encourage production using energy sources which can only obtain a price in the
competitive market that is insufficient to cover its costs of construction and operation,
with reasonable return on the investment. Therefore, they require subsidies to be

profitable.” !° For the Claimants, “reasonable return” is an “undefined legal concept.” !”

80. The basis of remuneration under the Special Regime was a feed-in-tariff (“FIT”)
calculated in Euro/c per kWh of electricity produced. The amount of premium was set

out in Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997, which reads as follows:

'5 Law 3/2013 of 4 June 2013 (published on 5 June 2013) (“Law 3/2013”), Exhibit C-69; Royal Decree 657/2013 of 30 August
2013 (published on 31 August 2013) (“RD 657/2013"), Exhibit C-70;, Order ECC/1796/2013 of 4 October 2013 (published on 5
October 2013) (“Order ECC/1796/2013"), Exhibit C-71; and CNMC, “Spanish Energy Regulator’s National Report to the
European Commission 2014”, 31 July 2014, p. 27, Exhibit C-72.

In order to determine the premiums, account shall be taken of the level of
delivery voltage of the energy to the grid, effective contribution to
improvement of the environment, saving in primary energy and energy
efficiency, production of economically justifiable useful heat and the
investment costs which have been incurred, in order to achieve reasonable
rates of return by reference to the cost of money in the capital market.'*

(d) 1998-2006 Regulations
i. Royal Decree 2818/1998

On 23 December 1998, Spain adopted Royal Decree 2818/1998 (“RD 2818/1998”) on
electricity production installations supplied by renewable energy, waste or
cogeneration. '° RD 2818/1998 was the first regulatory development of Article 30.4 of
Law 54/1997. The objective of RD 2818/1998 was to establish “a system of temporary
incentives for those facilities that require them in order to place them in a competitive

position in a free market.”

RD 2818/1998 enabled RE generators qualifying under the Special Regime to sell
electricity either under a regulated tariff or a premium paid on top of the wholesale
market price. The premiums and regulated tariffs were reviewed by the Spanish

Government annually, depending on the variation of the average price of electricity.”!

RD 2818/1998 also established the Administrative Registry for Production Facilities
under the Special Regime (“Registro Administrativo de Instalaciones de Produccién en
Régimen Especial” or “RAIPRE”) to facilitate the Government’s management and

control of the retribution under the legislation.”

ii. | The 2001 Renewables Directive

On 27 September 2001, following the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, the
European Parliament and Council passed Directive 2001/77/CE “on the promotion of
electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market”
(the “2001 Renewables Directive”).”> The 2001 Renewables Directive established
obligations for the EU Member States to take appropriate measures to increase future
electricity consumption derived from RE sources.”* This Directive also recognised the
“need for public support in favour of renewable energy sources is recognised in the
Community guidelines for State aid for environmental protection.”®> It further required
EU Member States to establish “national indicative targets for the consumption of
electricity produced from renewable sources” consistent with the overall target of 12%

of electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2010.76

In addition, the 2001 Renewables Directive required EU Members States to implement
a RE plan to comply with the Directive by 2003 and ensure that the charging of
transmission and distribution fees did not discriminate against electricity from RE

sources, among others.?’ Spain’s specific target was to draw 29.4% of its electricity

from RE sources by 2010.7*
iii. | Royal Decree 436/2004
86.

Spain enacted Royal Decree 436/2004 (“RD 436/2004”) on 12 March 2004,” and which
repealed RD 2818/1998. This decree, published on 27 March 2004, updated and
systemised the legal and economic regime under the Special Regime by establishing

that qualifying installations could sell electricity (i) at a regulated fixed tariff; or (ii) at

market prices and receive a premium FIT payment over and above the market price per
kWh produced.*° Both options were calculated by reference to a percentage of the
average electricity tariff fixed by the Government on an annual basis, the “tarifa media
de referencia” (“TMR”).*! Both values were subject to market fluctuations because the

regulated tariff and FIT were linked to the average cost of electricity.
87. Further, Article 40 established that:

1. During 2006, [...] the tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements
defined in this Royal Decree shall undergo revision. [...]. Every four years,
starting from 2006, a new revision shall take place.

2. The tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from any of
the revisions provided for in this section shall come into force on January
1st of the second year subsequent to the year that the revision has been
carried out.

3. The tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from any of
the revisions provided for in this section shall apply solely to the plants that
commence operating subsequent to the date of the entry into force referred
to in the paragraph above and shall not have a backdated effect on any
previous tariffs and premiums. [...].*?

iv. The 2005-2010 Renewable Energy Plan

88.  Spain’s Council of Ministers approved the 2005-2010 Renewable Energy Plan on 26
August 2005, which revised the earlier 2000-2010 Renewable Energy Plan adopted in
1999.3 The objective of the revised Renewable Energy Plan, prepared by IDAE, was
to maintain Spain’s commitment to cover at least 12% of the total energy demand with
renewable sources by 2010, and incorporate two other objectives: 29.4% of electricity

generation from renewables and 5.75% from biofuels in transport.**

89. The 2005-2010 Renewable Energy Plan established that the RD 436/2004 FIT regime
allowed wind producers to receive internal return rates above 7%, with own resources
and after tax.*> It also recommended increasing the installed capacity limit on tariffs,

incentives and premiums for wind sources from 13,000 MW to 20,000 Mw.*°
v. Royal Decree-Law 7/2006

90. Royal Decree Law 7/2006 (“RDL 7/2006”) was enacted on 23 June 2006.*” It amended
Law 54/1997 and gave RE installations priority of access to transmission and
distribution network.** This would allow generators to sell their electricity output in

preference to any other non-renewable producer.

91. RDL7/2006 also provided that future variations of the TMR would not apply to the RD
436/2004 FIT, which meant that the RD 436/2004 remuneration options would be

calculated in accordance with the TMR applicable in 2006.”

Regulatory Developments in 2007-2010
(a) Royal Decree 661/2007

92. On25 May 2007, Spain passed Royal Decree 661/2007 (“RD 661/2007”) regulating the
activity of electricity production under the Special Regime.*° RD 661/2007 replaced RD
436/2004. The objectives of the new policy are set out in the Preamble:

[A]lthough the growth experienced by the special electricity generation
regime as a whole has been noteworthy, the targets set for certain
technologies are still far from being achieved. From the point of view of
compensation, the business of the production of electrical energy under the
special regime is characterised by the possibility that the compensation

system can be supplemented by the receipt of a premium under the terms
and conditions established in the regulations, in order to determine which
such factors as the voltage level of the energy delivered into the grid, the
contribution to the improvement in the environment, primary energy saving,
energy efficiency, and the investment costs incurred, may all be taken into
account.“!

93. RD 661/2007 notably increased the installed capacity target for wind power generation
from 13,000 MW to 20,155 MW.” Article 22 established that when the 85% target of
the installed capacity was reached for any technology, there would be a time limit of at
least 12 months within which wind installations would be required to register with the
RAIPRE to benefit from RD 661/2007’s economic regime.** By registering with
RAIPRE, the installation qualified under the Special Regime and could thus benefit
from the support schemes established under RD 661/2007.**

94. With regard to the electricity output, RD 661/2007 provided qualifying RE generators

the right to choose between two forms of remuneration:

a) Sell the electricity to the system through the transport or distribution grid,
receiving for it a regulated tariff, which shall be the same for all scheduling
periods expressed in Euro cents per kilowatt/hour.

b) Sell the electricity in the electrical energy production market. In this case
the sale price of the electricity shall be the price obtained in the organised
market or the price freely negotiated by the proprietor or the representative
of the facility, supplemented where appropriate by a premium, in Eurocents
per kilowatt/hour.*>

95. A “regulated tariff’ is defined by Article 25 as a “fixed sum which shall be the same for

all scheduling periods and shall be determined as a function of the Category, Group, of

96. Article 2 of RD 661/2007 defined categories of facilities based on the primary energy
used, the type of technology and the energy yield. Wind facilities were included under

Category b.2 and the regulated tariff was set out in Table 3 of Article 36 as follows:*7

Power Term

 

97. Further, and contrary to what was established under RD 436/2004, tariffs for wind
energy producers were de-linked from the TMR and indexed to the consumer price

index (“CPI”). Article 44(3) indeed provided that:

[t]he values of the tariffs, premiums, supplements, and lower and upper
limits to the hourly price of the market as defined in this Royal Decree, for
Category b) [...] shall be updated on an annual basis using as a reference
the increase in the CPI less the value set out in the Additional Provision One
of the present Royal Decree.**

98. Particularly, Article 44(3) defined tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower and upper

limits as follows:

In 2010, in view of the results of the follow-up reports on the extent to which
the Renewable Energy Plan for 2005-2010 and the Energy Savings and
Efficiency Plan for Spain (E4) have been achieved, as well as the new
objectives included in the next Renewable Energy Plan for 2011-2020,
tariffs, premiums, additional payments, and lower and upper thresholds set

out in this royal decree will be reviewed, taking into account the costs
associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of the
special regime in meeting demand and its impact on the technical and
economic management of the system, guaranteeing reasonable returns with
reference to the cost of money on capital markets. Every four years
thereafter a new adjustment will be carried out using the above criteria.

The adjustment to the regulated tariff and the lower and upper threshold
referred to in this section will not affect the facilities for which the start-up
document was issued before January | of the second year in which the
adjustment was implemented.*?

99. Finally, RD 661/2007 also provided priority of access and dispatch to qualifying

installations and a bonus compensation for “reactive energy.”*°

(b) The 2009 Renewables Directive

100. On 23 April 2009, the EU approved the 2009 Directive “on the promotion and use of
energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives
2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC” (the “2009 Renewables Directive”).°*! The 2009
Renewables Directive’s objective was to obtain 20% of its total energy consumption
requirements with RE sources by 2020.*? Spain’s RD 661/2007 anticipated the measures

set out in the 2009 Renewables Directive.
(c) Royal Decree-Law 6/2009

101. Shortly after the adoption of the 2009 Renewables Directive, on 30 April 2009, Royal
Decree-Law 6/2009 (“RDL 6/2009”) was enacted by Spain.*? RDL 6/2009 recognised
the existence of a “growing tariff deficit’ in Spain and defined it as “the difference
between revenue from the regulated tariffs that are set by the Administration and that

consumers pay for their regulated supply and from the access tariffs that are set in the

liberalised market and the real costs associated with these tariffs.”>+ RDL 6/2009
further noted that the deficit was having a “profound effect on the system” and placing
at risk “not only the financial situation of the companies that make up the Electricity

Industry, but also the very sustainability of the system.”

Because of the “unsustainable” imbalance, which “undermines the security and the
capacity to fund the investments needed for the supply of electricity at the levels of
quality and security that Spanish society requires,” RDL 6/2009 recognised the “need
to adopt an urgent measure that serves to guarantee the necessary legal security of those

who have made investments.”*°

To tackle the tariff deficit, RDL 6/2009 set yearly limits from 2009 to 2012 on the
amount the tariff deficit could grow.’ RDL 6/2009 also established that from | January
2013, access tariffs should be sufficient to meet the entire cost of regulated activities
without ex ante deficit.** It thus required an increased regulated portion of the prices of

the end user electricity so as to comply with the tariff deficit yearly limits.*°

Article 4 of RDL 6/2009 also introduced a pre-assignment register mechanism (“Pre-
Assignment Register”) and stated that enrolment in the Pre-Assignment Register was
a necessary condition to benefit from the economic regime established in RD
661/2007. The Pre-Assignment Register was a prior step to the RAIPRE registration
and qualifying under the RD 661/2007 economic regime. Further, pursuant to RDL
6/2009, RE projects had to meet certain criteria in order to be registered. Once registered

with the Pre-Assignment Register, facilities had a limit of 36 months to be registered

105. The Council of Ministers adopted on 24 November 2009 a resolution establishing a
timetable classifying installations in four different phases with a view to establishing
the progressive entry into operation of those facilities and allow a more controlled

commissioning of wind plants.°!
(d) The Purported 2 July 2010 Agreement

106. On 2 July 2010, the Spanish Government issued a press release in which it stated that
the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce had reached an “agreement” with the
wind power sector, including the Wind Power Business Association (“AEE”), to revise
their rate structures. The Claimants and the Respondent are in disagreement as to the

nature of the 2 July 2010 “agreement”.

107. In the 2 July 2010 press release, the Government declared that there would be a fixed
limit to the numbers of hours during which wind facilities could benefit from the FIT

and that it would apply a reduction to the Premium of 35% until 1 January 2013.
(e) Royal Decree 1614/2010

108. On 7 December 2010, Spain adopted Royal Decree 1614/2010 on “regulating and
modifying certain aspects relating to the production of electricity based on

thermoelectric and wind technologies” (“RD 1614/2010”).° RD 1614/2010, which

established the reduction by 35% until 1 January 2013.°° Thereafter, the full premium

regime under RD 661/2007 would apply to all qualifying wind installations.®”

Furthermore, Article 5 of RD 1614/2010 provided as follows:

[flor wind technology facilities adhered to Royal Decree 661/2007, of 25
May, the revisions of the tariffs, premiums and upper and lower limits
referred to in article 44.3 of the aforementioned Royal Decree, shall not
affect facilities registered definitively in the Administrative Registry of
production facilities entitled to the special regime that is maintained by the
Directorate-General for Energy and Mining Policy as of 7 May 2009, nor to
those that would have been registered in the Remuneration Pre-assignment
Registry under the fourth transitional provision of Royal Decree-Law
6/2009, of 30 April, and that were to meet the obligation envisaged in article
4.8 thereof.®

In other words, reviews under Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 would depend on whether
the installations were definitely registered with the RAIPRE as of 7 May 2009 or
whether they satisfied the requirements for registration in the Pre-Assignment Register.

The Disputed Measures

The following section describes a series of measures adopted by Spain beginning 2012,

which are at issue in the present arbitration.
(a) Law 15/2012

On 27 December 2012, Spain adopted Law 15/2012 on “Tax Measures for Energy
Sustainability,” which entered into effect on 1 January 2013 (“Law 15/2012”).

© RD 1614/2010 of 7 December 2010, Article 2, Exhibit C-46.

29

113.

114.

115.

116.

117.

Pursuant to its Preamble, Law 15/2012 meant to “harmonise” Spain’s tax system
through “a more efficient and respectful use of the environment and sustainable
development [and] bring it into line with the basic principles that govern the tax, energy

and of course the environmental policy of the European Union.”””

Among other tax measures, Law 15/2012 introduced a 7% levy on “the total amount
that corresponds to the tax payer for the production of electricity and its incorporation
into the electricity system, measured at power station bus bars, for each facility, in the
tax period.””! This levy, known as the “Jmpuesto sobre el valor de la produccién de
energia eléctrica” (““TVPEE”) applied to all electricity production facilities, whether

they were registered under the Ordinary Regime or Special Regime.

According to the Respondent, the impact of the TVPEE on RE producers “has been
neutralized” because the “the specific remuneration received by renewable producers

enables them to recover certain cos:

 

s that, unlike conventional technologies, cannot be
recovered in the market, and, also, to obtain a reasonable return. Among those costs is
precisely the TVPEE.”” For Claimants, the 7% levy is a “disguised tariff cut for RE

installations and an additional limitation to the RD 661/2007 economic regime.”

(b) Royal Decree-Law 2/2013
On 1 February 2013, Spain adopted Royal Decree-Law 2/2013 “concerning urgent

measures within the electricity system and the financial sector” (“RDL 2/2013”).

RDL 2/2013 introduced several measures, two of which are impugned by the Claimants.
First, RDL 2/2013 reduced to zero the amount of the premium that both existing and

future installations expected to receive as a supplement to the market price for electricity

under Article 36 of RD 661/2007.”° Thus, facilities under the Special Regime were

forced to receive the fixed tariff.

Second, RDL 2/2013 introduced a change to the inflation index applicable to the FIT.
RDL 2/2013 provided that tariffs applicable to the electricity sector would no longer be
updated by reference to the CPI but rather, to the “CPI at constant tax rates, excluding
unprocessed foods and energy products” as of 1 January 2013.” According to the

Claimants, the impact of this measure on the Claimants’ investments was “limited.”77

On 19 February 2015, the Spanish Constitutional Court dismissed a challenge against
RDL 2/2013, upholding its constitutionality.”* On 26 March 2015, the Supreme Court
upheld the legality of the RDL 2/2013.”

(c) Royal Decree-Law 9/2013

On 12 July 2013, the Government enacted Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 adopting urgent
measures “fo guarantee the financial stability of the electricity system” (“RDL
9/2013”), which entered into force on 14 July 2013.*° Pursuant to its Preamble, the
objective of RDL 9/2013 was to introduce:

a series of measures which are urgent, balanced, proportional and reaching,
aimed at guaranteeing the financial stability of the electricity system as an
unavoidable prerequisite for the economic sustainability thereof and to
ensure a secure supply, and which are addressed to all electricity sector
activities.*!

121. RDL 9/2013 made substantial modifications to the 1997 Electricity Law, by repealing
RD 661/2007 and establishing a new remuneration regime for RE facilities, which

applied to both existing and new installations. For the Claimants, the regime under RDL

9/2013 (“New Regime”) represented a “complete overhaul of the Special Regime.”

According to the Claimants, the New Regime “resulted in a 41% reduction in the

Claimants’ cash flows.”*

122. In particular, the New Regime amended Article 30(4) of RD 661/2007 as follows:

4. Additionally, subject to the terms that the Council of Ministers might
adopt pursuant to Royal Decrees, in relation to the remuneration for the
generation of electricity calculated according to market price, installations
may receive a specific remuneration [the Special Payment] composed of an
amount per unit of installed capacity. Such amount shall cover, as
appropriate, the investment costs of a standard installation that cannot be
recovered through the sale of energy, as well as an amount for the operation
of the installation to cover, as the case may be, the difference between
exploitation costs and the revenues obtained from the participation of such
a standard installation in the market.

For the calculation of that specific remuneration, the following elements
shall be considered, based on the installation’s regulatory useful life and by
reference to the activities carried out by an efficient and well administered
business:

a) The standard revenues for the sale of generated energy valued at market
price of production;

b) The standard exploitation costs; and

c) The standard value of the initial investment.

To that effect, the costs or investments determined by laws or administrative
regulations that do not apply to the Spanish territory shall not be considered

in any case. In the same manner, only those costs and investments related
to the activity of electric energy generation can be taken into account.

32

As a result of the individual characteristics of the electricity system in the
Spanish islands or the extra-peninsular territories, a standard installation for
each of those electricity systems may be defined.

This remuneration regime shall not exceed the minimum required level to
cover the costs that are necessary for installations to compete on an equal
footing with the rest of the technologies in the market in order to allow those
installations to obtain a reasonable return, by reference to the standard
installation, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the above, exceptionally,
the remuneration regime might also include an incentive to investments and
timely execution of an installation, if this was going to result in a significant
cost reduction for the Spanish islands or the extra-peninsular territories’
electricity systems.

Such reasonable return will be based on, before taxes, the average returns
in the secondary market of the State's ten-year bonds plus the adequate
differential.

The parameters of the remuneration regime can be revised every six years.**

123. By repealing RD 661/2007, RDL 9/2013 repealed the remunerative scheme for RE
producers based on the Regulated Tariff or a premium in addition to electricity market
prices.*° Under the New Regime, RE producers were to receive a “Special Payment”
taking into account the following elements: (i) the “standard revenues for the sale of
generated energy valued at market price of production;” (ii) the “standard exploitation

costs;” and (iii) the “standard value of the initial investment.”*®

124. RDL 9/2013 also provided that the parameters of the remuneration regime could be
revised every six years.*” Further, the “reasonable rate of return” for facilities
benefitting from the FIT as of the effective date of RDL 9/2013 was to be “referenced,
before tax, to the average yield during the ten years prior to the this Royal Decree-Law
coming into effect from ten-year Government Bonds in the secondary market, increased

by 300 base points.”**

125. On 17 December 2015 and 18 February 2016, Spain’s Constitutional Court dismissed

challenges against certain provisions of RDL 9/2013.”
(d) Law 24/2013

126. On 26 December 2013, Spain adopted Law 24/2013 on the Electricity Sector, which
replaced Law 54/1997 (“Law 24/2013”). In its Preamble, Law 24/2013 says that Law
54/1997 “has proven to be insufficient in terms of guaranteeing the financial balance of
the system, amongst other reasons because the system for paying or rewarding
regulated activities is lacking in the necessary flexibility for its adaptation to cope with

the significant changes pertaining to the electric system or in economy trends.”°!

127. Law 24/2013 incorporated and extended the economic regime established in RDL
9/2013. Notably, Law 24/2013 formally eliminated the distinction between the Ordinary

Regime and Special Regime.”

128. Further, Article 14(4) of Law 24/2013 provided that, in the New Regime, “remuneration
parameters” for RE projects would remain valid for regulatory periods of six years, and
could be “revised prior to the start of the regulatory period.”** Pursuant to Article 14(7),
the remuneration mechanism would be calculated to provide reasonable profits for the
installations and would rely on (i) the standard revenue from the energy produced
(revised every three years for the rest of the regulatory period); (ii) the standard
operating costs; and (iii) the standard value of the initial investment.™ It further

established that the “reasonable return” was to be calculated throughout the “regulatory

life of the plant.”

Law 24/2013 did not however fully define the economic regime under the New Regime.
As described below, additional implementing measures were required to define the

applicable economic regime for RE installations.
(e) Royal Decree 413/2014 and Ministerial Order MO IET/1045/2014

On 6 June 2014, Spain adopted Royal Decree 413/2014 “regulating the production of
electricity from renewable energy sources, cogeneration and waste” (“RD
413/2014”).°° This regulation was adopted to implement the new regime set forth by
Law 23/2014.

Among other measures, RD 413/2014 established the formulas for calculating the two
components of the Special Payment under the new regime: (i) a remuneration per MW
of installed capacity; and (ii) a remuneration per MWh of electricity produced to cover
the operating costs that cannot be met by market prices.°” RD 413/2014 also subjected

the Special Payment to certain thresholds of operating hours.*

RD 413/2014 also provided that the “remuneration parameters” could be revised at the
end of each “regulatory period’ of six years but also at the end of each “semi

(regulatory)” period of three years.”

On 16 June 2014, the Ministry of Industry and Tourism issued Ministerial Order
TET/1045/2014 to further implement the New Regime and define the applicable
economic regime for RE producers (“June 2014 Order”).'°° The June 2014 Order

V. JURISDICTION
141. The Respondent raises two general objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

. First, Spain asserts that the Tribunal lacks ratione personae jurisdiction
because the law of the European Union (“EU”) precludes the applicability
of the ECT to disputes involving investments in an EU state by EU investors
(the intra-EU Objection);

° Second, Spain contends that the 7% TVPEE, created by Law 15/2012 of 27
December 2012 on fiscal measures for energy sustainability, is a tax
measure which falls outside the scope of protection of the ECT (the TVPEE

Objection).

A. The Intra-EU Objection

142.

143.

144.

1. The Respondent’s Position

Spain submits that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione personae because the
ECT does not apply to disputes involving investments made within the EU by investors
from other EU countries (intra-EU investors). Spain advances several arguments in

support of its position laid out below.
(a) Existence of an “Investor” from “another Contracting Party”

Spain recalls that Article 26(1) of the ECT requires that the dispute submitted to
arbitration occur between “a Contracting Party and an investor of another Contracting
Party.” 116 Noting that the Claimants, on the one hand, are nationals of Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, ''” i.e. EU Member States, and the Respondent, on the other hand, is also a
national of the EU—itself a party to the ECT—, Spain concludes that this “inevitably
implies the exclusion of [Article 26(1) of the ECT] from any case where an investor of

an EU State has a dispute with an EU State, in relation to an investment in said State.”''8

(b) Relationship between EU law and the ECT

The Respondent alleges that the Claimants’ investment is made within the internal
market in electricity of the EU which confers protection on EU-investors which is
“preferential to the protection conferred by the ECT and any BIT.” Since both Spain
and the Claimants were already EU Member States when the ECT was concluded, “they

had transferred their sovereignty to the [EU]’''? with respect to the energy market,

Respondent further notes that the Spanish companies, Watkins Spain S.L., Redpier S.L., Northsea Spain .L., Parque Eélico

themselves
The Respondent further alleges that EU law forbids the existence of any dispute
settlement mechanism other than those established by EU treaties. If the Tribunal was
to decide on this matter, it would be “interfering with the competence of the judicial

system of the EU.”'?!

In this context, the jurisdictional system of the EU, Spain maintains, has “the monopoly”

99122

on “the latest interpretation of EU Law,”'~ and the EU prevents the settlement of intra-

EU disputes by “any dispute settlement mechanism other than that established by its

Treaties, which may interfere with the bases of the Internal Market.”'*

Citing Costa v. ENEL, the Respondent argues that the foregoing stems from “the
essential principle on which the objection to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal is

raised,” that is to say, “the principle of primacy of EU law.”'4

Further, according to Spain, that “the intra-EU investor protection system prevails over
any in any other international treaty” does not arise solely from the specific attributes
of the EU, but it also has “its literal recognition in the ECT itself.”'?> The Respondent
finds support for its position in an “effective interpretation” '”° of the ECT’s wording,
context and purpose, referring, in particular, to the ECT’s provisions pertaining to

Regional Economic Integration Organizations (the “REIOs”).

27 Respondent's Rejoinder, J 139:

The Respondent relies, inter alia, on several provisions of the ECT to support this
argument. For example, Article 1(2) of the ECT, which defines the Contracting Party
as “a state or [REIO] which has consented to be bound by this Treaty and for which the
Treaty is in force.”'?’ Another article invoked by Spain is Article 1(3) of the ECT,
which defines a REIO as “an organization constituted by states to which they have
transferred competence over certain matters a number of which are governed by this
Treaty, including the authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of those
matters.” According to Spain, this provision demonstrates that the ECT expressly
recognises that the EU may exercise sole competence with respect to certain matters,
“because its Member States no longer have competence to do so.”'?? In this regard,
Spain notes that the EU is the only REIO that is part of the ECT. Spain continues its
allegation on the interpretation of the ECT by referring to Article 25 of the ECT, which
provides that the ECT’s most-favuored-nation treatment obligations do not extend to
preferential treatment accorded to members of an Economic Integration Agreement
eliminating or prohibiting discriminatory measures among its members. In Spain’s
view, Article 25 of the ECT recognises the principle of primacy of EU law in intra-EU
relations and acknowledges that “the process of economic integration in the EU is more
advanced than that of the ECT and ultimately more favorable to the investor.” *° Article
36(7) of the ECT accords to a REIO a number of votes equivalent to the number of its
member States when voting on matters as to which the REIO has competence. In this
context, Spain submits that the decision “as to who is the competent Contracting Party

in each matter is not the responsibility of the Arbitral Tribunal, but of the CJEU.”!

Moreover, Spain invokes Article 26(6) of the ECT in support of its argument that the

law applicable to the present dispute is “this Treaty and applicable rules and principles

of international law,” which, Spain maintains, includes EU law.'** In this context, Spain

quotes Electrabel v. Hungary:

[...] the Tribunal concludes that Article 307 EC precludes inconsistent
preexisting treaty rights of EU Member States and their own nationals
against other EU Member States; and it follows, if the ECT and EU law
remained incompatible notwithstanding all efforts at harmonization, that
EU law would prevail over the ECT’s substantive protections and that the
ECT could not apply inconsistently with EU law to such a national's claim
against an EU Member State. '**
151. Spain also refers to Article 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
(the “TFEU”), which provides that “Member States undertake not to submit a dispute
concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement

other than those provided for therein.” '*+

152. In Spain’s view, this provision prevents Spain from submitting any matters related to
the harmonised internal electricity market to arbitration.'*> Admitting this possibility,
Spain contends, would mean that the Tribunal would have to rule upon the rights of EU
investors in the internal market.'*® In this respect, Spain points out that the Court of
Justice of the European Union (the “CJEU”) had already opined that such situation
would be incompatible with EU law because the CJEU has exclusive jurisdiction over

the interpretation of EU law.!*7
153. Likewise, Spain considers that its position is in line with that of the Commission, which
“has reiterated that arbitration is not applicable as a mechanism of dispute resolution

ever since the first intra-community disputes arose relating to BITs.”** In the same

vein, Spain invokes supportive writings which state, inter alia, that “there seem to be
good reasons for the Commission to push for ensuring that EU law is the only regime
governing investment flows within the European market and that the [CJEU] is the only

ultimate instance for interpreting and applying these rules.”'*°

In further support of its position, the Respondent alludes to the purpose of the ECT,
which, according to its interpretation, was not intended to “cover an area, that of intra-
EU investments, which had been totally covered—and in a far superior manner—for
years by EU Law.” Rather, the ECT’s objective “lies in the wish of the Council of the
then EC to speed up the economic recovery of Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin

Wall through cooperation in the energy sector.”'*!

Finally, Spain concludes its intra-EU Objection by referring to the Commission’s
decision in Micula v. Romania, implying that the Commission might regard any
monetary award by the Tribunal in favour of the Claimants as impermissible State aid,

incompatible with EU law.!4?

In support of this argument, Spain provided further evidence in its Rejoinder indicating
that the Commission’s Decision in the State aid procedure SA.40348 (20151NN) from
November 2017 which declared the incompatibility of the measures in dispute with EU

Law. !43

(c) Disconnection clause

Quoting the Opinion 1/03 of the Commission, '**

the Respondent notes that it is
irrelevant that the ECT does not contain an express disconnection clause when such a

clause is related to covered areas where there has been total harmonization. !45

In its Post-Hearing submissions, the Respondent raised the disconnection clause to
address Claimants’ argument that “the conflict between EU law and Article 26 of the
ECT should be solved by applying Article 16 of the ECT.”'“° Spain’s contention is that
Article 26(6) requires the Tribunal to apply EU law in this dispute which in turn makes
this article the “disconnection clause” '*’ Respondent further clarified that it intends for
the ECT to be applied “with all its consequences, which include the lack of jurisdiction
of the Arbitral Tribunal to hear intra-EU disputes concerning a key institution in

European law: State Aid.”'**
(d) Relevance of previous awards

Spain denies the adequacy of the Claimants’ assertion that all international investment
tribunals dealing with the intra-EU objection have rejected it. In Spain’s view, these
cases must be distinguished either because (i) they involve bilateral investment treaties
and not the ECT, which is signed by the EU; or (ii) they concern obligations assumed
by States that were not yet members of the EU when they signed the ECT; or (iii) they

do not consider the principle of primacy of EU law.'*?

160. First, in Spain’s view, the tribunal in Eureko v. Slovakia, invoked by the Claimants,
expressly recognised the “inability to extrapolate its findings to treaties such as the

ECT.”!50

161. Second, Spain also differentiated the Electrabel v. Hungary case where the respondent
State signed the ECT when it had not yet joined the EU. According to Spain, Hungary,
unlike Spain, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, was thus able to enter into obligations

under Part III of the ECT.'*!

162. Third, PV Investors v. Spain, Charanne v. Spain, RREEF v. Spain, Isolux v. Spain and
Eiser v. Spain must all be distinguished, Spain maintains, on the basis that they fail to
examine an “essential element of [Spain’s] objection,” the principle of primacy of EU

law. !52

In this regard, Spain underlines that it is precisely requesting an express
pronouncement from the Tribunal about the “validity and application” of the principle

of primacy of EU law.!°?

163. In its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder, Spain noted that it “maintain[ed] this
jurisdictional objection” until the CJEU resolves two cases pending before it and
pertaining to the compatibility between intra-EU BITs and EU law, Achmea and Micula
v. Romania. Spain considers that the Tribunal shall also bear in mind several
Commission’s decisions on the aid systems of Spain and the Czech Republic regarding
renewable energy, in which the Commission held that arbitration was incompatible with

EU law.!*4

164. In its Post-Hearing submission, Spain further developed its arguments on the Achmea
based on the decision of 6 March 2018.'°° Spain argues that the three prerequisites of
the Achmea case are also present in this case. The first refers to “whether the disputes
which the [ ] Tribunal is called on to resolve are liable to relate to the interpretation or
application of EU law.”'*° Spain argues that the “dispute concerns [...] fundamental
freedoms of EU [and]... State Aid” and that the first prerequisite is “met in the case at

hand.”'*7

165. Regarding the second prerequisite, on the principle of autonomy, Spain says that the
Tribunal is not a court because it “Jacks permanence, state nature, and mandatory

competence,” which results in that it does not belong to the EU judicial system and

“cannot make a reference for a preliminary ruling to the CJEU.”'°8

166. Finally, the third prerequisite, a decision of this Tribunal would only allow for review
by an ad hoc Committee which is contrary to EU law which requires that arbitral awards

be subject to review by a court of a Member State. !°?

2. The Claimants’ Position
(a) Existence of an “Investor” from “another Contracting Party”

167. According to the Claimants, “both the EU and its Member States are Contracting Parties
to the ECT and may be subject to claims brought by Investors from other Contracting

Parties,” including the different Member States of the EU. 160

(b) Relationship between EU law and the ECT

For the Claimants, nothing in Article 26 of the ECT could be construed as to prohibit
intra-EU disputes. '*! The plain meaning of Article 26 provides for the constant intent of
the Contracting Parties to the ECT to provide their “unconditional consent to

arbitration.”

The Claimants further dispute that the ECT provisions pertaining to REIOs cited by
Spain demonstrate that the ECT excludes intra-EU claims. 163 The text of these Articles,
the Claimants maintain, “is clear and can in no way be construed to deprive EU
Investors of the right to bring a claim against EU Member States under Article 26 of the
ECT.” 164

Moreover, the Claimants deny Spain’s contention that Article 344 of the TFEU
precludes the submission of intra-EU disputes to arbitration pursuant to Article 26 of
the ECT. In the Claimants’ view, “a plain reading of Article 344 of the TFEU shows
that it applies only to disputes involving two or more EU Member States’ and it “does
not refer to investor-State arbitration.” This was confirmed, according to the Claimants,

by the tribunals in, inter alia, Eiser, Electrabel and Charanne.'®

The Claimants also specify that, contrary to Spain’s stance, the subjective intentions of
the EU and its Member States are irrelevant to an interpretation of Article 26 of the
ECT.!® Yet, the Claimants observe, even if it were permissible to interpret Article 26
of the ECT in such fashion, “there is nothing within the provisions of EU law that could
be understood to override the rights granted in Article 26 of the ECT.” Referring to

Electrabel, Eastern Sugar, Charanne and RREEF, the Claimants contend that “the ECT

grants investors rights that are additional to any other rights provided by the internal

market and that there is no inconsistency between EU law and the ECT.”

In this respect, the Claimants add that “[e]ven if the ECT and EU treaties were found to
cover the same subject matter, Article 16 of the ECT provides that the provision more
favourable to the investor shall apply.” Accordingly, “if there were a provision of the
EU treaties prohibiting Investor-State arbitration (which there is not), Article 26 would
prevail.” '°8 In their Rejoinder, the Claimants highlight that EU law does not offer
investors the recourse to international arbitration, whereas the ECT does; and that “the
right of qualifying Investors such as the Claimants to bring their claims under the ECT
is “favourable” precisely because it de-politicises the dispute by removing it from the

purview of Spain's national courts.” !°

(c) Disconnection clause

According to the Claimants, “ECT, the EU and its Member States did not negotiate a

[disconnection] clause for their inter se relationships”

and reading an implicit intra-
EU disconnection clause into the ECT is irreconcilable with the ordinary meaning of

the ECT.

While noting that “the Respondent does not maintain the existence of an explicit or
implicit disconnection clause,” and that it “is a point on which the Parties now agree,”!7!
the Claimants contend that Spain continues to rely on the Commission’s opinion that
the ECT contains an implicit disconnection clause without, however, explaining in what

context it relies on it.

(d) Relevance of previous awards

The Claimants argue that there have been, to date, no fewer than fifteen tribunals that
have considered and rejected the intra-EU argument.!” The Claimants note that in six
of these cases, the respondent State was Spain.'* Spain’s attempts to distinguish these

awards are, in the Claimants’ view, unavailing.

Further, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s unsupported contention that there are
two categories of Contracting Parties under the ECT, i.e. the “old” and “new” EU
Member States.'’> The Claimants assert that this contention is unhelpful to Spain
because it would mean that Article 26 would only be applicable to intra-EU disputes
“so long as either the home State of the claimant-investor or the respondent-host State
was not an EU Member State at the time the ECT was signed.”!7° For the Claimants,

this interpretation is not supported in the text, object or purpose of the ECT.!7”

As regards the Achmea and Micula v. Romania cases invoked by the Respondent

regarding the compatibility between BITs and EU law, the Claimants note the following:

° As for Achmea, the Claimants note that the CJEU has ruled on the matter in
its recent judgment of 6 March 2018, and held that the submission to
arbitration set forth in Article 8 of the BIT between the Netherlands and
Slovakia is incompatible with EU law. According to the Claimants, the case

must however be distinguished because “(i) the CJEU only addresses a BIT

and not the ECT, a circumstance which the CJEU itself goes out of its way
to highlight; and (ii) the CJEU’s decision is not binding on this Tribunal
which, as confirmed by numerous arbitral precedents, is not called upon to
apply EU law.”'’® The Claimants further explain that there are several
differences between the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT and the ECT. The
Claimants analyse that in this case, “[Article 26(6)] provides that disputes
shall be solely resolved on the basis of (i) the ECT and (ii) applicable rules
of international law.”'” This Tribunal would then not be called to apply
EU law.'®° The Claimants further argue that, different from the Achmea
case, this case is “been brought before ICSID,”'*' the question before the
CJEU “has no relevance in this ECT arbitration” '**
Netherlands and Luxembourg had already acceded the EU when the ECT

as Spain, The

was ratified, and “the Tribunal derives its jurisdiction from the ECT and it

is not bound by the decisions of European Institutions.”'

e As for Micula v. Romania, the Claimants observe that Spain fails to mention
that no Intra-EU Objection was raised by Romania in the Micula v. Romania
jurisdictional proceedings, that the objection was only raised by the
Commission, intervening as a non-disputing party, during the annulment
proceedings, and that the ad hoc committee dismissed the Commission’s
submission, holding that the tribunal had not lacked jurisdiction to hear the
Claimants’ claims. The Claimants also note that Spain refers to an
application to the CJEU to annul the Commission’s decision of 30 March
2015 on the non-enforceability of the arbitral award in Micula v. Romania,

payment of which has been deemed by the Commission to constitute illegal

State aid. For the Claimants, the application relates to whether the

enforcement within the EU of an arbitral award pursuant to Article 54 of the

ICSID Convention could be considered incompatible with EU law; it does

not concern jurisdiction-related matters.

179. Further, for the Claimants, Spain’s references to the Commission’s decisions on support

schemes are irrelevant since, as held in Charanne, “the question of whether a certain

support scheme could constitute incompatible State aid under EU law could only

possibly affect the merits of the relevant dispute, not jurisdiction, and then only at the

enforcement stage of the proceedings.

concerning an intra-EU claim:

1)

2)

3)

4)

184 Claimants’ Rejoinder, 20.

The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae as the Claimants are
not investors “of another Contracting Party” under Article 26(a) of the

ECT.

The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because of the relationship between EU

law and the ECT.

The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because of the existence of an implicit

disconnection clause within the ECT.

The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because of the impact of the Achmea

judgment of the CJEU.

Sl

(a) Existence of an “Investor” from “another Contracting Party”

181. According to the Respondent, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae as the
Claimants do not comply with the definition of a protected investor provided for in the
ECT. The general idea is that the élément d’extranéité required in this provision is

missing as far as an intra-EU dispute is concerned.

182. The dispute settlement clause, Article 26 ECT, specifies that “Disputes between a
Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an
Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of
an obligation of the former under Part ITI shall, if possible, be settled amicably”. Absent
any amicable settlement, parties will have recourse to investment arbitration. The
Respondent objects that the conditions set up in Article 26(1) ECT are not satisfied.

183. Like other tribunals have already considered in relation to this objection, '**

the present
Tribunal considers that the starting point to answer such an objection should be an
interpretation of Article 26 ECT in the light of customary rules of treaty interpretation
under public international law, as codified in Articles 31-32 of the Vienna Convention

on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT” or “Vienna Convention”).

184. First, the Tribunal has to verify whether the EU membership of the State of nationality
of the investor and of the host State of the investment implies that the condition of

diversity of territory (Area in the terms of the ECT) is not respected.

185. Article 1.10 ECT defines the concept of “area” as “the territory under its sovereignty,
it being understood that territory includes land, internal waters and the territorial sea’.
Moreover, in relation to regional international organizations of economic integration,
such as the EU it clarifies that: “with respect to a Regional Economic Integration

Organization which is a Contracting Party, Area means the Areas of the member states

52

of such Organization, under the provisions contained in the agreement establishing

that Organization”.

186. It follows from an interpretation of Article 26 ECT in light of Article 1.10 ECT and in
conformity with customary rules of treaty interpretation, that the dispute here opposes
Investors of several Contracting Parties (Luxembourg and the Netherlands) to another

Contracting Party (Spain) on the territory of whom the investment was made.

187. Another possible way of approaching the objection consists in focusing on the notion of
“another Contracting Party” stressed in Article 26 ECT. The Claimants have the
nationality of an EU Member State and the Respondent is itself an EU Member State.
This kind of intra-EU dispute would not enter within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal

under Article 26 ECT.

188. Even taking this approach in interpreting Article 26 ECT, the Tribunal cannot agree
with the reasoning developed by the Respondent, be it by taking the perspective of
public international law or of EU law. The European Court of Justice has clarified in the
Micheletti case that “under international law, it is for each Member State, having due
regard to Community law, to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of
nationality.” 8° The European citizenship is based on superimposition on the nationality
of a Member State and this concept could not be used to take out any élément

d’extranéité within the present dispute.

189. The reasoning would be totally different if one were to accept the existence of an

implicit disconnection clause argument that the Tribunal will analyse separately infra.

186 Case C-369/90 - Micheletti and Others v. Delegacién del Gobierno en Cantabria, Judgment of the Court of 7 July 1992,
ECLI:EU:C:1992:295, 10.

53

(b) The primacy/prevalence of EU law argument

190. The crux of the Respondent’s arguments relates to an idea of primacy or prevalence of
EU law over the ECT, be it because the investment is made within the internal market,
or because EU law forbids the use of any dispute settlement mechanism not established
by EU treaties or because of the monopoly of the CJEU concerning the interpretation of

EU law.

191. The Tribunal doubts that, even from an EU law perspective, EU treaties prohibit the
existence of any dispute settlement mechanism not established by EU treaties or that the
monopoly of interpretation of EU law by the CJEU would have the implications that the
Respondent tries to achieve. However, it considers that these considerations are not

relevant for the assessment of the jurisdiction of a treaty-based investment tribunal.

192. This is all the more the case given that this Tribunal is an ICSID tribunal. As clarified

in the Electrabel award:

[T]his Tribunal is placed in a public international law context and not a
national or regional context. Moreover, this ICSID arbitration does not have
its seat or legal place of arbitration in Hungary or elsewhere in the European
Union. Such an arbitral seat could trigger the application of the lex loci
arbitri and give rise to the jurisdiction of the local courts in regard to the
arbitral process, including challenges to the award. This ICSID arbitration
is a dispute resolution mechanism governed exclusively by international
law. '87

193. As international law is the sole body of law governing its jurisdiction, this Tribunal
derives its jurisdictional power exclusively from the ECT,'*® which is a valid and

enforceable treaty.

'87 Electrabel S.A. v. The Republic of Hungary, ICSID Case No. ARB/O7/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and
Liability, 30 November 2012, J 4.112, Exhibit CL-86.

2015/063, Award, 15 February 2018, 463, Exhibit CL-160.

54

194. Moreover, as clearly stated in the Charanne award, “this case does not entail any
assessment with regards to the validity of community acts or decisions adopted by
European Union organs. Additionally, it does not concern in any way allegations by the
European Union that EU law has been violated, nor claims against such organization.
In this arbitration there is not an argument according to which the content of the disputed

provisions [...] is contrary to EU law.”!8°

195. For this reason, the Tribunal considers that it does not have to solve any question of
hierarchy between EU law and international law for jurisdictional purposes. What is
more, the CJEU in Achmea confirmed that investment tribunals are not tribunals within
the meaning of Article 267 TFEU and therefore do not operate stricto sensu within the
EU judicial system. This dualist reasoning reinforces the idea that ICSID tribunals are
located in a legal space solely governed by international law that is the only source of

jurisdiction.

196. The arguments of the Respondent concerning the primacy or prevalence of EU law over

the ECT are therefore rejected.
(c) Disconnection clause

197. The Tribunal is also not convinced by the Respondent’s argument concerning the
existence of an implicit disconnection clause in Article 26 ECT. According to the
meaning of a “disconnection clause”, some parties to a multilateral treaty modify the
effect of this agreement in their inter se relations by applying different specific rules,

agreed among them.

198. The adoption of disconnection clauses in favour of EU law is developed in some
European treaty practice. This practice has attracted strong criticism. The use of explicit
disconnection clauses was contested first in the context of the ILC Study Group on

Fragmentation, according to whom this practice raises serious problems of equal

application of treaty norms between parties.'°° The Council of Europe similarly shed
doubts on this practice: the Parliamentary Assembly “oppose[d] such a clause, which
has the potential to give rise to new divisions in Europe between the parties which are

members of the European Union and those which are not.” !°!

In this context, the Tribunal cannot but be reluctant to accept the idea of an implicit or

tacit disconnection clause.

As clearly put in the RREEF case, the idea of an implicit disconnection clause would
challenge the very fundamental international law principle of pacta sunt servanda: “if
one or more parties to a treaty wish to exclude the application of that treaty in certain
respect or circumstances, they must either make a reservation (excluded in the present
case by Article 46 of the ECT) or include an unequivocal disconnection clause in the
treaty itself. The attempt to construe an implicit clause into Article 26 of the ECT is

untenable, given that that article already contains express exceptions.” !*

In awards or decisions such as Charanne and RREEF it was argued that, in any case,
such a clause would be moot as there is no conflict between the ECT and the TFEU.!
The present Tribunal recalls that the decision of the CJEU in the Achmea case clearly
took the opposite stance and declared the existence of a constitutional conflict between
EU procedural law principles and a BIT mixed arbitration mechanism. That is why this

line of argumentation should be taken with caution.

From the perspective of the international law of treaties, an implicit inter se modification

of this type cannot be considered as existing. What is more, even from the perspective

of EU constitutional law, the existence of an implicit disconnection clause is
systemically debatable. Article 3(5) of the TEU recalls that the European Union is
subject “to the strict observance and the development of international law”. In its
Western Sahara Campaign case, the CJEU interpreted Article 3(5) of the TEU as a
treaty provision that requires a consistent and harmonious interpretation of European
treaty practice with international law.'*4 That is why both international law and EU law

counter the argument of an implicit disconnection clause.
(d) Relevance of previous awards

203. An important debate exists in international investment arbitration concerning the
relevance of previous awards. A paragraph of the Burlington award epitomises the

divergences on this point:

The Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the
same time, it is of the opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier
decisions of international tribunals. The majority believes that, subject to
compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt solutions established in
a series of consistent cases. It also believes that, subject to the specifics of
a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to
seek to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law, and
thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and
investors towards the certainty of the rule of law. Arbitrator Stern does not
analyze the arbitrator’s role in the same manner, as she considers it her duty
to decide each case on its own merits, independently of any apparent
jurisprudential trend. !°°

204. The Tribunal does not believe that, to answer to the jurisdictional issues raised, it is
necessary to adopt any general position on the relevance of precedents in international
investment law or to decide which arbitral awards having decided on the relations
between EU law and the ECT should be followed or not. The primary function of an
arbitral tribunal is to solve the dispute between the parties applying the chosen law to

the facts. While so doing, the Tribunal can of course take inspiration from previous

awards, in as far as their legal reasoning helps the instant tribunal to clarify the content

of the law.

The most disputed question in this regard is how to take into account the Achmea

decision of the CJEU and the arbitral awards having taken a stance in this regard.

 

The CJEU rendered its Achmea decision on March 6, 2018, holding that investor-state
dispute settlement in intra-EU BITs is incompatible with EU law. In this Achmea case,
the CJEU dealt with an intra-EU BIT and decided that the ISDS provision contained in
Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT (1991) is incompatible with Articles 267!°°
and 344!°” TFEU because, by empowering the arbitral tribunals to apply EU law while
simultaneously removing disputes from the jurisdiction of the courts of EU Member

States, it undermines the autonomy of the EU’s legal order. !°*

Arbitral tribunals having to deal with intra-EU investment cases have consistently
rejected the idea that the Achmea judgment of the CJEU could have a bearing on their
own jurisdiction. This Arbitral Tribunal sees that the reasoning has, up to now, followed
three different paths. According to a first reasoning, some tribunals have reached a
different conclusion from the CJEU on the relationship between EU law and
international investment law: they defend the absence of incompatibility between the
two regimes. A second reasoning has rejected the Achmea stance as being not pertinent
because of the difference of legal nature of the treaty used as a basis for jurisdiction. A
third reasoning has strongly advocated the parallelism of treaties and refused to identify

any conflict between the investment treaty and the European treaties.

196 Article 267 TFEU allows courts and tribunals of EU Member States to refer questions on the interpretation of EU law and
validity of EU secondary legislation to the CJEU, see Exhibit RL-0001.

58

(i) First line of argumentation: Achmea’s solution is ill-grounded

208. A first kind of reasoning consists in taking the position opposite to the CJEU’s one
concerning the relationship between EU law and international investment law generally,
and the ECT more specifically. Some tribunals clearly try to demonstrate that there is

no such incompatibility between the two sets of rules.

209. The Electrabel award adopted this solution before the Achmea judgment, stating that
the genesis of the ECT generates a presumption of absence of contradiction between EU
Jaw and the ECT. Following such reasoning, the /solux tribunal considered that EU law

does not prohibit the submission of a dispute to investment arbitration. !°?

210. In Blusun, the tribunal considered that the ECT had given rise to valid inter se
obligations of EU Member States?. First, the tribunal considered that even if, as a
matter of EU law, the EU had exclusive competence over matters of international
investment, Member States to the EU signed the ECT without qualification or
reservation. The inter se obligations in the ECT do not have to be considered invalid or
inapplicable because of such an allocation of competence to the EU.”°! Second, the
tribunal rejected the submission that subsequent EU treaties implicitly repealed the
earlier ECT under the /ex posterior rule in Article 30 of the VCLT, whereby “successive
treaties relating to the same subject-matter will prevail over the earlier to the extent
that the treaties are not compatible,” finding no incompatibility with respect to

substantive protections or dispute resolution.?°”

211. The PL tribunal considered, for instance, that contrary to what the CJEU considered
Article 344 of the TFEU is not applicable as the dispute before the tribunal is not
between two EU member States even if it ultimately arises out of a treaty between

them.

(ii) Second line of argumentation: Achmea is not pertinent in a multilateral treaty-

based context

212. Inthe Masdar award,?™* the tribunal stressed the fact that the Achmea decision was of

“limited application’””® since it focused on the incompatibility of a bilateral investment
treaty in the intra-EU context. The basic distinguishing criterion is the difference
between the bilateral context of the Achmea case and the multilateral context of an ECT-

based arbitration.

213. The Masdar tribunal relied on the opinion of Advocate General Wathelet before the
CJEU who had himself attracted the attention of the Court on the difference between a
bilateral and a multilateral context.2 As the CJEU did not further elaborate on this idea,
it had to be considered that the Court had not dealt with this last scenario and that,

therefore, “the Achmea Judgment has no bearing upon the present case.”?""

 

214. This argument was approved in the Vattenfall decision. For the tribunal, it was “an open
question whether the same considerations necessarily apply to the ECT.” 7° Thus,

agreeing with the Masdar tribunal, the tribunal found no clear rule relevant to

interpretation of the ECT in the Achmea ruling. The Greentech tribunal also followed

the same reasoning.7°

(iti) Third line of argumentation: Achmea’s solution has no bearing in another

legal order

A last line of argumentation is based on two basic ideas, grounded in public international
law: the parallelism of treaties and the distinction between the EU legal order and the
international legal order. Some decisions followed a dualist argument distinguishing
clearly between the EU legal order and the international legal order. The two legal orders

are distinct and should not be seen as working in conflict but in harmony.

Investment tribunals have thought the relationship between treaties dealing with
investment issues in terms of parallelism even before the Achmea debate burgeoned.
The European American Investment Bank tribunal, most notably, stated that “the
parallel rules under the BIT and the ECT are not incompatible, but should be viewed as

cumulative.” 7!

Facing more precisely the Achmea debate, different arguments can be traced back to
this general idea. In both the awards in the Eiser and Antin cases, it was maintained that
the ordinary meaning of Article 26 of the ECT confers jurisdiction on the tribunal. An
exclusion for intra-EU disputes would have to be express and clear, especially given

that the EU is a party to the treaty.7!!

This is also the idea developed in the RREEF Decision. Because of treaty parallelism,

the two treaties are both applicable. Therefore, they must be interpreted in such a way

as not to contradict each other. Indeed, there is no conflict between Article 26 ECT and

Article 344 TFUE, as they concern the settlement of two different kinds of disputes. In
any case, in case of any contradiction between the ECT and EU law, the tribunal would
have to apply the ECT; if there must be a “hierarchy” between these norms, it must be

determined from the perspective of public international law.?!?

219, The Anglia tribunal stated that the BIT tribunal has jurisdiction only to determine the
matters of interpretation and application of the BIT between the disputing parties and in
relation to their dispute. Therefore, as the BIT tribunal has no jurisdiction to interpret
the TFEU, EU law has no bearing on an enforceable treaty existing in the international
legal order.?'3 The UP tribunal similarly considered that as the tribunal’s jurisdiction is
based on the ICSID Convention, the tribunal is placed in a public international law
context and not in a national or regional context. The two legal orders evolve in parallel
and the tribunal finds its jurisdiction in a treaty validly established in the international

legal order.?!*

conflict between Article 26 ECT and Articles 267 and 344 TFEU, and it is therefore not
necessary for the tribunal to apply the rules of conflict of law so as to resolve any
purported conflict between them.”!® Moreover, it is stated that there is “no principle of
public international law, or even of EU law, which would permit the tribunal to interpret
the words of the ECT, being its foundational jurisdictional instrument, so as to give

priority to external treaties (the TFEU and the TEU) and a court judgment interpreting

those treaties.”?""

4, The Tribunal’s Decision

221. First, having been rendered in the context of a BIT, it is clear that the Achmea judgment
is silent as far as the ECT is concerned. Nevertheless, the case of the ECT is particular
as the genesis of the treaty generates a presumption of absence of contradiction between
EU law and the ECT itself. As the CJEU did not elaborate on this precise legal
instrument and the Achmea judgment is silent on the case of ECT-based arbitration, the

Tribunal cannot infer the position of the CJEU dealing with this scenario.

222. As the ordinary meaning of Article 26 of the ECT confers jurisdiction on the Tribunal,
any exclusion of intra-EU disputes would have to be express and clear, especially given

that the EU is a party to the treaty.

223. Second, as already stated, the Tribunal believes that “this ICSID arbitration is a dispute
resolution mechanism governed exclusively by international law.”*'® Because of the
principle of treaty parallelism, the Tribunal has to rely on the ECT and to apply its

jurisdictional provisions.

224. The idea of parallelism of treaties is a fundamental principle of public international law.
The principle was clearly elaborated in the Bluefin Tuna arbitration?!®, but can be traced
back to the case law of the Permanent Court of International Justice elaborating on this

221

fundamental principle?’ that has since become well-established. Since treaties

evolve in parallel, the presumption is the absence of conflict between them, as also

clarified in WTO case law.”

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is based on the ICSID Convention, the ECT, and general
international law principles governing State consent. The Tribunal is placed in a public
international law context and not in a national or regional context. The two legal orders
(the EU legal order and the ECT normative space) evolve in parallel and the Tribunal

finds its jurisdiction in a treaty validly established in the international legal order.

As maintained by the tribunal in Marfin, “The Tribunal recalls in this context that its
jurisdiction derives not only from the Treaty, but also from the ICSID Convention. It is

thus the Tribunal’s duty to give effect to this legal instrument”.

The Tax Objection
1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the dispute over
the tax measures that Spain had adopted through the introduction of the TVPEE by Law
15/2012, which, according to the Claimants, resulted in the breach of Spain’s
obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT.?*4 Spain’s main arguments in support of its

Tax Objection are described in seriatim below.

(a) Spain’s consent to arbitration is restricted to disputes pertaining to alleged

violations of obligations derived from Part III of the ECT

According to Spain, under Article 26 of the ECT, it “[has] only consented to submit to

investment arbitration alleged breaches of obligations derived from Part III of the

22 Panel Report, Indonesia — Certain Measures Affecting the Automobile Industry, WT/DS5S4/R-WTIDS55/R-WT/DS59/R-

231.

ECT.” Yet, pursuant to Article 21 of the ECT, Spain maintains, “section (1) of Article
10 of the ECT, invoked by the Claimants, despite being located in Part III of the ECT,
does not give rise to obligations with regard to taxation measures of the Contracting

Parties.”°6

(b) The ECT does not impose obligations regarding tax measures of the

Contracting Parties

Spain supports this objection on, inter alia, Articles 21(1) and 21(7)(a) of the ECT.
Article 21(1) provides:

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall
create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the
Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this Article
and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent
of the inconsistency.?””

While Article 21(7) reads as follows:
(a) The term ‘Taxation Measure’ includes:

(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or

of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein; ...27*

Spain contends that the ECT does not impose obligations or create rights with respect
to the Contracting Parties’ tax measures so there is a general exclusion of taxation
measures from the scope of the ECT (taxation carve-out) unless it is included in the

expressly defined exceptions under Article 21 of the ECT (claw-backs).?2°

Sections (2) through (5) are as follows:

(2) Article 7(3) shall apply to Taxation Measures other than those on income
or on capital, except that such provision shall not apply to: [...]
(3) Article 10(2) and (7) shall apply to Taxation Measures of the
Contracting Parties other than those on income or on capital, except that
such provisions shall not apply to: [...]
(4) Article 29(2) to (8)63 shall apply to Taxation Measures other than those
on income or on capital.
(5) (a) Article 13 shall apply to taxes.
(b) Whenever an issue arises under Article 13, to the extent it
pertains to whether a tax constitutes an expropriation or whether a
tax alleged to constitute an expropriation is discriminatory, the
following provisions shall apply: [...]?°°

Referring to these exceptions, Spain observes that “none of the exceptions [...] by which
taxation measures are included in the scope of protection of the ECT comprises section
(1) of Article 10 of the ECT.”®' Accordingly, Spain concludes, “section (1) of Article
10 of the ECT, on which the Claimants try to base their claims, does not impose any

obligations for the Contracting Parties regarding taxation measures.”*>”

Spain concedes that the only sections of Article 10 of the ECT that do apply to taxation
measures are sections (2) and (7), however, the Claimants support their claim on Section

10(1). Consequently, section (1) of Article 10 of the ECT invoked by Claimants, is not

applicable to taxation measures.

(c) The TPVEE is a tax measure for the purposes of the ECT

According to Spain, there are two possible interpretations of the above-mentioned
provision of the ECT for the purposes of determining whether a challenged measure is

a “tax measure” and falls under the scope of the ECT’s taxation carve-out: either (i) the

250 Energy Charter Treaty, Art. 21(2) through 21(5), Exhibit RL-0006.

measure must be defined in reference to the domestic law of the Contracting Party, or
(ii) it must be defined from the perspective of international law.7*+

235 the wording

Spain submits that, in accordance, inter alia, with arbitration case law,
of Section (7)(a)(i) of Article 21 of the ECT itself, or Article 3 of the double taxation
Convention between Spain and Luxembourg, the Tribunal shall adopt the first
interpretation.?°° Notwithstanding this recommendation, Spain remarks that “to the
extent relevant for this arbitration, either of the two stated interpretations of Article

21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT leads us to conclude that the TVPEE is a tax.”?*”

First, in regards to the TVPEE being a tax under the domestic law, Spain contends that
Law 15/2012 is domestic law, approved by the Spanish Parliament in accordance with
the ordinary legislative procedure governed by Spanish law.?** Spain further alleges that

Law 15/2012 “is clear about the taxation nature of the TVPEE,”>*® which was also

 

ratified by the Spanish Constitutional Court.?*° On the latter, Spain refers to the Spanish
Constitutional Court Judgment of 6 November 2014 which dismissed an appeal against
the TVPEE and declaring the “TVPEE regulation contained in Law 15/2012 as perfectly

valid and in accordance with the Spanish Constitution.”**!

Second, with respect to international law, Spain affirms that the TVPEE also has the
characteristics of a tax measure under international law (i) as interpreted by international

investment tribunals,”4?

and (ii) confirmed by the European Commission, which had
specifically ratified the tax nature of the TVPEE and its compliance with EU law.”
Thus, Spain concludes, “there is no doubt that the TVPEE is a tax, both from the

perspective of Spanish law and from the perspective of international law.”?+

In the light of the foregoing, Spain concludes that “‘the provisions relating to the TVPEE
of Law 15/2012 are provisions relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Kingdom of

99245

Spain, and, accordingly, the TVPEE is a tax for the purposes of the ECT.4°

(d) The TPVEE is a bona fide tax measure for the purposes of the ECT

In its Rejoinder, Spain asserts that, to determine whether the TPVEE is a taxation
measure for the purposes of the ECT, the Tribunal only needs to analyse whether the
TPVEE falls within the ECT definition. It does not, according to Spain, need to examine
the bona fide nature of the tax, including its economic effect, as urged by the

Claimants.”

In this context, Spain distinguishes the case of Yukos, invoked by the Claimants, noting

 

that it involved “extraordinary circumstances,” and, as a result, “the analysis of the good

faith of the taxation measures undertaken in the Yukos case is not applicable to the

present case.”*48

242. Spain further refers to EnCana v. Ecuador to stress that the Tribunal is only to consider

the “legal operation” of a taxation measure, and not its “economic effect.”

243. However, should the Tribunal proceed with the additional analysis suggested by the
Claimants to determine whether the TPVEE falls within the taxation carve-out under
Article 21 of the ECT, in Spain’s view, it must only conclude that the TPVEE is a bona

fide tax. Spain advances three arguments in support of this assertion.

244. First, Spain sustains that the TVPEE, as a tax of general application, applies to all

energy producers, both renewable and conventional.”>!

It applies to all producers
without distinction. The general application, according to the Respondent, is a
legitimate option of the legislator, which has been recognised by the Spanish
Constitutional Court.*°? Spain further argues that the fact that the TVPEE equally
applies to conventional as well as to renewable producers, “without including tax
benefits for renewable producers, cannot be construed in any way as the reason to deny

the bona fide nature of this taxation measure.””>

245. Second, in response to the Claimants’ contention that RE producers, as opposed to
conventional producers, are unable to pass the tax to the consumer results in the TPVEE
being discriminatory, the Respondent alleges that it is not discriminatory from the
perspective of its legal consequence or economic consequence. On the legal
consequence, Spain explains that the TPVEE is a direct tax that is not passed on by
taxpayers, whether they are producers of renewable or conventional energy.”** On the

economic consequence, Spain argues that there is no discrimination between

248.

conventional and renewable energy producers because both would recover the amount

of the TVPEE through the market price.”

Third, to counter the Claimants’ assertion that the TPVEE constitutes a disguised tariff
cut, Spain notes that the TVPEE is a public income included in the General State
Budget, *° which contributes to the State resources for financing of public
expenditures.” Spain highlights that an amount equivalent to the estimated annual
collection deriving from the taxes included in Law 15/2012, among them the TVPEE,
is destined to the promotion of RE.”** In other words, Spain maintains, “the purpose of

the TVPEE is to raise revenue for the Spanish State for public purposes.”**?

Spain also referred the Tribunal to the decisions in /solux and Eiser, in which, according
to Spain, the tribunals agreed with Spain’s position when declaring their lack of
jurisdiction to hear disputes regarding the alleged breach of obligations derived from

Section (1) of Article 10 of the ECT resulting from the enactment of the TVWPEE by Law
15/2012.7

In its Post-Hearing brief, Spain affirms its position that the tribunal lacks jurisdiction to
hear the claim of an alleged breach of Article 10(1) by the enactment of the TVPEE and
further notes that “all Awards rendered so far in Spanish cases have upheld this

Jurisdictional Objection.”°!

2. The Claimants’ Position

(a) The “taxation carve-out” under Article 21 of the ECT only applies to bona
fide taxes

249. According to the Claimants, Spain’s arguments aimed at establishing the TVPEE’s
character as a “tax” under domestic law are irrelevant.2© Instead, the question is
whether the taxation measure is bona fide and therefore entitled to the benefit of the

taxation carve-out under Article 21 of the ECT.

250. In the Claimants’ view, the basis for the requirement under Article 21 is that taxation
measures must be bona fide derived from the basic principle of good faith in
international law. The Claimants argue that Spain cannot avail itself of the exemption
under Article 21 if the measure is disguised as a tax with the ultimate intent to achieve
another purpose.”°? On this argument, the Claimants call the Tribunal’s attention to the
text of Article 21 and the Yukos case to conclude that the fact that a measure is labelled

as a tax does not imply that the taxation carve-out applies.”

251. The Claimants also contend Respondent's interpretation of the EnCana v. Ecuador case
asking the tribunal to consider only the “/egal operation” of the taxation measure and
not the “economic effect.”*® The Claimants point out that the EnCana tribunal noted
that “arbitrary measures would not qualify for exemption under the taxation carve-out

contained” in the corresponding BIT.?°°

252. The Claimants contend that there is a clear distinction between bona fide and abusive
taxation measures under international law. The Claimants argue that good faith is a

fundamental principle of treaty interpretation and performance, which “pervades all

aspects of Investor-State relations.”?*’ According to the Claimants, this is demonstrated,
inter alia, by Article 31(1) of the VCLT, extensive scholarship and international case-

law, which is also associated with the concept of estoppel.7°

253. The Claimants argue that the Tribunal must look into the State’s pattern of conduct to
determine, on the balance of probabilities, whether the measure concerned is bona
fide.2® The Claimants dispute Spain’s contention that the tribunal in Yukos recognised
a presumption in favour of the validity of tax measures, claiming instead that the Yukos
decision demonstrates that the bona fide nature (or lack thereof) of a tax measure must
be assessed from the conduct of the State on the basis of the balance of probabilities.?”
In this regard, the Claimants allege that there is prima facie evidence that the 7% tax is

arbitrary and discriminatory.?”!

254. In this regard, the Claimants also refer to Feldman v. Mexico to assert that “where a

taxation measure is prima facie arbitrary or discriminatory, the burden of proof

switches to the respondent State to provide a rational explanation for its conduct.”?”

The Claimants conclude that “Article 21 is not triggered and that there is a breach of

the ECT if the balance of evidence and surrounding circumstances are more consistent

with the claim that the 7% Levy was implemented as a disguised cut of the rights granted

under RD 661/2007."?"*

255. In their Post-Hearing Reply brief, the Claimants further this argument on the basis of
the Antaris v. Czech Republic award. In this award, according to the Claimants, the
tribunal applied the two-limb test to determine whether the carve-out applied: (i) the
domestic law of the host State must first characterise the measure as a tax for Article 21
to apply, and (ii) tribunal must determine whether the measure is also a tax within the
scope of Article 21 by looking at the requirement of whether it is “directed at raising
general revenue for the state.”*"* In this case, the Claimants concentrate on the second
limb and allege that the funds raised by the TVPEE are not used for the general public

purpose of the State but rather redirected to the electricity system.7”>

(b) The 7% levy is not a bona fide tax

256. According to the Claimants, the TPVEE is not a bona fide tax, but a tariff cut. In their
Reply, the Claimants summarise their views as follows: “it is readily apparent from
Spain’s conduct that the 7% Levy is not a real tax measure, but was in fact a measure
designed to strip away the rights of the Claimants’ installations under the RD 661/2007
regulatory regime.” ?’® The most obvious illustration of this is, according to the
Claimants, the fact that “the money raised by the 7% Levy goes from the electricity

producers within the electrici stem to the State budget and then back to the

277

  

electricity system in order to cover the costs of the electricity system.

257. In particular, the Claimants argue that (i) Spain’s conduct reveals that even though

denominated as a tax, the TPVEE was intended to be a tariff cut; (ii) the TPVEE, de

Government scheme to dismantle the RD 661/2007 economic regime through which the

Claimants were encouraged to invest.

First, the Claimants explain that to understand Spain’s intent regarding the TVPEE, it
is important to understand the context in which Law 15/2012 was approved.?”* The
Claimants then refer to a statement made by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and
Tourism after the enactment of the disputed measure, acknowledging that the
Government could have opted to reduce premiums for RE installations, but instead
chose to adopt the tax on generation.””? The Claimants further note that the Minister's
comments as well as the implementation of the TPVEE occurred at a time when Spain
“(a) was already defending ECT claims; (b) had retained legal advice to defend those
claims; and (c) was aware of the Article 21 ECT provision containing the taxation
carve-out.””®° Hence, the Claimants conclude, that the TVPEE is not a bona fide tax
based on that “[t]he inference must be that the 7% Levy was framed as a tax with the

purpose of avoiding liability for breaching investors’ rights under the ECT.’?*!

Second, the Claimants allege that the measure discriminates against RE plants because,
unlike their conventional counterparts that can raise prices to pass the tax to consumers,
the government determines renewable plants’ revenues, preventing them to pass along
the burden of the tax.?8? Additionally, the Claimants submit that, while the Preamble of
the TPVEE indicates that the measure’s aim is to protect the environment, Spain has not
provided a rational link between the TVPEE and its professed aim, but rather the

opposite that it purports to achieve resulting in an impact on the incentives that RE

installations were supposed to receive.?** Further to this argument, the Claimants say

that the TVPEE had a disparate impact on RE plants.7*4

260. Third, the Claimants indicate that they are not challenging the TVPEE as a discrete
measure in isolation but rather considering all measures taken by Spain and their impact
on the Claimants’ investment.?*° The Claimants distinguish the Plama v. Bulgaria case
relied by the Respondent on the basis that the investors in that case made their
investments when the Bulgarian taxation laws were already in place. Differently from
this case, the Claimants say, where the taxation measures were implemented after the

investment was made.?°°

261. Finally, the Claimants sustain that Spain’s labelling of the measure as a tax under its
internal law is irrelevant to determine whether Article 21 is applicable, as it has been
supported by several authorities.*7 The Respondent gives the TVPEE an appearance
of a tax by channelling the funds levied through the Law 15/2012 through the State
Budget and then return to the electricity system.7** Even if the measure was enacted in
compliance with its domestic law, the Claimants contend that this is irrelevant if the
Respondent is evading its international obligations.*° Furthermore, for Claimants, the
fact that it complies with the definition of tax under international law as Respondent

contends, does not demonstrate that the TVPEE is bona fide.?

(c) Response to Spain’s new submissions

The Claimants also responded to the following new submissions of Spain contained in
its Rejoinder in defence to the TVPEE: (i) the tax measure had a valid purpose, (ii) the
cost of the TVPEE is covered by the remuneration in the New Regime, and (iii) Spain’s
position regarding the TVPEE has been shared by other tribunals, in particular, the

Isolux and Eiser tribunals.°!

The Claimants point out that Spain has not explained why the environmental effects
caused by transport and distribution networks should be attributed in greater measure to
the RE installations. Further to this argument, the Claimants call the Tribunal’s attention
to a decision from the Spanish Supreme Court calling for doubts as to the environmental

purpose of the TVPEE.”*?

The Claimants also argue that the New Regime does not cover the cost of the TVPEE.
The Claimants allege that the disputed measures have caused the Claimants to loss value
of their investment and that the TVPEE allows Spain to reduce the revenues of existing

RE installations.”

Finally, the Claimants differentiate this case from the /solux and Eiser cases alleging
that they have proven that the TVPEE was not to raise revenues but rather to reduce the

tariff deficit and to reduce the economic rights for investors.?°*

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

Relying on the fact that Article 21(1) ECT is a “carve out” clause, the Respondent

argues that taxation measures are excluded from the treaty protection and that the

Tribunal lacks jurisdiction for the claims concerning the violation of Article 10(1)

because of the adoption of Law 15/2012, having introduced the TVPEE.

The Claimants do not put into question the qualification of the TVPEE as “tax” but they
basically contend that this measure is not a bona fide taxation measure, as it is arbitrary
and discriminatory.°%* It would be a tariff cut, designed to strip away the rights of the
Claimants under the RD 661/2007 regulatory regime.?*° Therefore, the measure would

not be covered by the Article 21 exemption.

Article 21(1) ECT established that: “Except as otherwise provided in this Article,
nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation
Measures of the Contracting Parties”. The provision entails a lack of jurisdiction
ratione materiae of the tribunal, whose jurisdiction is limited to the disputes relating to

the rights and obligations stemming from the ECT.7°”

As for the question concerning the bona fide character of the tax, this Tribunal recalls
that the Yukos Universal v. Russia award clarified that “the carve out of Article 21(1)
can apply only to bona fide taxation actions, i.e., actions that are motivated by the
purpose of raising general revenue for the State. By contrast, actions that are taken only
under the guise of taxation, but in reality aim to achieve an entirely unrelated purpose
(such as the destruction of a company or the elimination of a political opponent) cannot
qualify for exemption from protection standards.””°* Fundamentally, the Tribunal’s

standard of review here lies in controlling the existence of an “abuse of tax law.”?°°

The Claimants bear the duty to prove that the tax measure was not adopted in order to
raise the revenue of the State but for other purposes.*” This burden of proof is
particularly demanding, as “States have a wide latitude in imposing and enforcing
taxation law, even if resulting in substantial deprivation without compensation.”*”!
Arbitral awards having decided that such was the case were faced with extreme
situations, where the State was aiming at destructing a political opponent.*°? The
presumption is the bona fide exercise of the taxation power: “the power to tax is a core

sovereign power that should not be questioned lightly.”*°>

In relation to that, the Claimants tried to shift the burden of proof claiming that the
taxation measure was arbitrary and discriminatory, relying on the principle established

by the Feldman v. Mexico award.**

Nevertheless, the Tribunal agrees with previous cases that the standard of review in
relation to a carve-out clause is limited to the assessment of an egregious abuse of tax

power. The Claimants have not proved that this is the case.

In addition, the Claimants contended that the TVPEE was a mere tariff cut while being
presented as an environmental measure. As clearly established in the /solux award, even
if the finality of the tax measure was not purely the protection of the environment but
the enrichment of the State, this objective would nevertheless coincide with the aim of
a taxation measure and would not be sufficient to establish the bad faith of the

Respondent.*” The present Tribunal shares this view.

274. The Tribunal considers that the Claimants failed to demonstrate any improper or abusive
use of the State’s power to tax. Therefore, Article 21(1) of the ECT applies to carve out

taxation measures from the jurisdiction ratione materiae of the Tribunal.

VI. APPLICABLE LAW
A. Article 42 of the ICSID Convention and 26(6) of the ECT

275. The Parties agree that Articles 42(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 26(6) of the

ECT define the law applicable to the merits of this dispute.

276. The Claimants assert that (i) the ECT serves as the primary source of law, and, (ii) where
the ECT is silent, “the Tribunal should apply customary international law and general

principles of international law.”*°6

277. The Respondent agrees with the Claimants that the Tribunal shall apply the rules

contained within the ECT and other rules and principles of International Law to the

merits of this case.

278. However, as regards to the “rules and principles of international law,” Spain points out
that this provision incorporates rules of EU law, the application of which should lead

the Tribunal to the dismissal of the Claimants’ claims.*””

B. Relevance of EU Law
1. Respondent’s Position

279. The Respondent contends that EU law is applicable international law,*°* and that it must

be applied by the Tribunal to decide all the issues in dispute, including jurisdictional,

307 Respondent's Counter-Memorial, { 883-890.
308 Respondent's Rejoinder, { 132.

79

merits and quantum issues as required by Article 26(6) of the ECT.* Spain further
argues that Article 26(6) of the ECT does not grant ECT prevalence over any other

applicable rule or principle of international law.*!°

280. The Respondent argues that the present dispute is an intra-EU dispute that concerns
investments of investors of Member States of the EU made in another Member State of
the EU. The Respondent explains that the Claimants made their investment in reliance
of the fundamental freedoms provided under EU law and not in reliance with the

ECT.*"! Therefore, Spain argues, EU law has to be applied to this intra-EU relationship.

281. In addition to citing the Electrabel, Blusun and Wirtgen cases, the Respondent supports
this argument on the ruling of the CJEU in the Preliminary Ruling of 6 March 2018 in

the Achmea decision:

(...) According to settled case-law of the Court, the autonomy of EU law
with respect both to the law of the Member States and to international law
is justified by the essential characteristics of the EU and its law, relating in
particular to the constitutional structure of the EU and the very nature of
that law. EU law is characterised by the fact that it stems from an
independent source of law, the Treaties, by its primacy over the laws of the
Member States, and by the direct effect of a whole series of provisions
which are applicable to their nationals and to the Member States themselves.
Those characteristics have given rise to a structured network of principles,
rules and mutually interdependent legal relations binding the EU and its
Member States reciprocally and binding its Member States to each other
(see, to that effect, Opinion 2/13 (Accession of the EU to the ECHR) of 18
December 2014, EU:C:2014:2454, paragraphs 165 to 167 and the case-law
cited).

EU law is thus based on the fundamental premise that each Member State
shares with all the other Member States, and recognises that they share with
it, a set of common values on which the EU is founded, as stated in Article
2 TEU. That premise implies and justifies the existence of mutual trust
between the Member States that those values will be recognised, and
therefore that the law of the EU that implements them will be respected. It

is precisely in that context that the Member States are obliged, by reason
inter alia of the principle of sincere cooperation set out in the first
subparagraph of Article 4(3) TEU, to ensure in their respective territories
the application of and respect for EU law, and to take for those purposes
any appropriate measure, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment
of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the
institutions of the EU (Opinion 2/13 (Accession of the EU to the ECHR) of
18 December 2014, EU:C:2014:2454, paragraphs 168 and 173 and the case-
law cited).?!2

282. The Respondent also contends that the Tribunal must apply EU law to resolve this
dispute, otherwise, any adopted decision by the Tribunal would be contrary to EU
regulation governing State aid in favour of renewable energy in member States.*!> This
is regardless of whether the dispute is intra-EU or not.*!4 The Respondent notes that the
EU Commission has established that the subsidies provided under RD 661/2007 (as
amended by RD 1614/2010) are State aid under EU law.*!> The Respondent further

argues on this point that EU law is decisive to determine the scope of the Claimants’

316

rights,*!° their legitimate expectations,*!’ and the proportionality and reasonability of

the disputed measures.?!®

The Respondent contends that State aid is only permissible under EU law as long as

they contribute to the purpose for which they were created.*!°

The Respondent also argues that EU law and principles applied to decide all issues in
dispute are not limited to Treaties but also comprise acts of EU institutions and notes
that it has been interpreted as such in other cases such as Electrabel, Blusun, and

Wirtgen.

The Respondent therefore argues that the Commission’s Decision on State aid is binding
and this Tribunal “cannot elude its application... [as it] affects matters of public

order.”

The Respondent further adds that EU law is part of Spanish law. Therefore, Spanish
Courts are part of the EU legal system to ensure compliance with EU regulations.*?! EU

law on State aid is a matter of public order in the EU territory.*””

2. Claimants’ Position

In response to Spain’s allegation that no investor could have legitimate expectations to
receive the RD 661/2007 FIT, the Claimants respond that when Bridgepoint invested in
August 2011, it could not have expected that RD 661/2007 could be declared to be
unlawful State aid because this was not clarified until the Order of 22 October 2014 of

the CJEU.2%

288. The Claimants also point out that RD 661/2007 has not been found to constitute State

aid.224

289. The Claimants respond to Spain’s argument that the Tribunal is bound by the EU
Commission’s decisions that awarding the Claimants damages in this arbitration would
not be in breach of EU State aid rules. To support this argument, the Claimants note
that “the returns the Claimants would obtain at the project level under RD 661/2007
But-For scenario would be between 8% and 9% post-tax. These figures do not qualify
as windfall profits and would fall well within the range of returns that the EU

woe . . 9932:
Commission has considered proportionate.”*”>

290. The Claimants oppose the Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal should apply
Spanish law in the present dispute. The Claimants note that “a State cannot, by pleading
that its conduct conforms to the provisions of its internal law, escape the

characterisation of that conduct as wrongful by international law.”??6

C. The Object and Purpose of the ECT
1. Claimants’ Position

291. The Claimants state that, as required by Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT, the “ECT shall
be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning given to its terms
in their context and in the light of the ECT's object and purpose.”**’

292. The Claimants understand that the fundamental objective of the ECT is to facilitate
transactions and investments in the energy sector by reducing political and regulatory

risks.*°8 The ECT seeks to accomplish this objective, in particular, by requiring the

Contracting States to maintain a stable, predictable and transparent legal and regulatory

framework for such investments.*”?

293. By ratifying the ECT, Contracting States agreed: (a) to provide such a framework to
investors in the energy sector; and (b) to be held to account in the event that they fail to

do so.3°

294. The Claimants argue that energy investments are different from many other types of
investments due to: (a) their capital-intensive nature, with very high upfront capital
costs; (b) the lengthy period of time required for the investor to receive a return of and
on their investment; and (c) their decades-long operating horizons. These particular
characteristics make a stable, predictable and transparent legal and regulatory

framework a sine qua non for energy investments.**!

295. Contrary to the Respondent’s argument, the Claimants assert that the ECT provides a
high level of protection for investors in the energy sector, in particular those for their

long-term and capital-intensive nature.***

296. The Claimants understand that there is a fundamental distinction between the protection
of national treatment and FET under the ECT. National treatment is a contingent
standard of investor protection. It is necessary to show that a local investor has received
better treatment than the foreign investor to establish a breach of the national treatment
standard. In contrast, FET is a non-contingent investor protection. The contingent and
non-contingent standards “operate independently” in that “the fact that an investor is
treated as well as a local one will not necessarily mean that the foreigner has received

fair and equitable treatment.”>*

Principles (2nd ed. Oxford University Press, 2007), {| 7.192, Exhibit CL-117.

84

297. In this context, the Claimants differentiate the cases cited by Spain from this case. The
Claimants explain that the FET standard is broader than the minimum standard of
proof.**4 Spain contends that the Total tribunal applied the minimum standard of

protection required by the FET, which would allow a State to modify its legal

framework, provided that the investor is still able to recover its operating costs, amortise
its investment and make a “reasonable return” over said period of time. However,
according to the Claimants, the Total decision is unhelpful to Spain’s case as: (a) it was
not rendered pursuant to the ECT but to the 1991 France-Argentina BIT, which, unlike
the ECT, does not contain any engagement with regard to stable conditions for investors;

(b) contrary to what Spain contends, the Total tribunal considered that the FET standard

“cannot be read as ‘treatment required by the minimum standard of treatment of

aliens/investors under international law”’ and (c) the quotations from Total used by

Spain were remarks made when weighing the investors’ legitimate expectations on the

one hand and the Respondent’s legitimate regulatory interests on the other in the absence

of any specific stability commitment, as noted above. In this context, the Total tribunal
found that the concept of “regulatory fairness” or “regulatory certainty” intervenes to
ensure that the investors recover their operation costs and make a “reasonable return.”

In the Claimants’ view, these facts clearly differentiate the Total tribunal’s findings from

the issue at hand, which is whether Spain may radically change the remuneration regime

on which the Claimants relied when making their investment when it made the express

commitment not to.3*°

298. The Claimants also point out that Spain has not analysed the exceptions found in Article
24 of the ECT but rather read in two exceptions to the FET standard that are not in the

text.36

The Claimants counter Spain’s argument that considers Article 10(8) and
Article 9 of the ECT to provide an exception to FET in relation to “the public aid

regime.” The Claimants respond that Article 10(8) of the ECT simply does not apply in

the context of this case as the present dispute does not concern treatment afforded by

Spain in relation to “energy technology research and development.”**"

The Claimants also respond to Spain’s alleged exception contained in Article 9(4) of
the ECT that it only relates to the obligations on Contracting Parties contained in Article
9 itself. The Claimants’ plain reading of Article 9 makes clear that the Article 9(4)

exceptions do not apply to any other provision of the ECT.***

As to Spain’s reliance on the “Energy Charter Treaty Readers Guide” to claim that no
liability under the ECT can arise from “macroeconomic control measures”, the
Claimants’ response is that it is plainly wrong to rely on such a document, since the

document does not form part of the ECT.

The Claimants invested approximately €91 million into the Spanish wind generation
sector. In doing so, upon inducements and promises made by Spain, they reasonably
relied on the expectations that the Wind Farms, in which they invested, would be entitled
to the economic regime of RD 661/2007, conferring immutable economic rights
protected by the ECT, for their entire operational lifetime. This was, according to the

Claimants, “a sine qua non to the Claimants’ decision to invest in the plant.”**°

However, contrary to the Claimants’ reasonable expectations and Spain’s assurances,
Spain has, through the acts and omissions of its organs, allegedly taken several wrongful
measures, which have fundamentally altered the applicable legal and regulatory
framework in reliance upon which the Claimants’ investments were made. These
include, but not limited to, Law 15/2012, RDL 2/2013, RDL 9/2013, Law 24/2013, RD
413/2014 and the June 2014 Order (“Disputed Measures”).*#! As a result of the

Disputed Measures, the Claimants allege that they have suffered considerable losses.

The Claimants allege that Spain’s measures violated Article 10(1) of the ECT, namely:

(a) the obligation under Article 10(1) to accord, at all times, to the Claimants’
investment, “stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions,”

(b) the obligation under Article 10(1) to accord, at all times, to the Claimants’
investment, fair and equitable treatment (“FET”), and

(c) the obligation under Article 10(1) to observe obligations it had entered into

with the Claimants or their investments (the Umbrella Clause).*“7

303. According to the Claimants, Spain adopted, inter alia, the following Disputed

Measures:*3

° Law 15/2012, introducing the TPVEE which, according to the Claimants,
amounts to a tariff cut;

° RDL 2/2013, which, inter alia, deprived the Claimants of “the most
attractive support scheme option under RD 661/2007,” the Premium option
(which offered the possibility of maximizing revenues by way of selling to
the market when demand in the network was the highest);

° RDL 9/2013, which revoked RD 661/2007 and established a New Regime
for RE power-generation installations radically different from the
framework established by RD 661/2007;

° Law 24/2013, which, inter alia, (i) repealed the distinction between
Ordinary Regime and Special Regime established by RDL 9/2013, (ii) put
conventional and RE generators on an equal footing and, most importantly,
(iii) established the applicability of a “reasonable return” over the entire
life of the plant, thereby implementing a “maximum degree” retroactivity.

According to the Claimants, both the future and past income streams were

returns” and “Spain introduced "maximum degree" retroactivity by directly
impacting the past income streams of the plant, effectively altering the rules
of the game over the energy already produced and already sold on the
market by the Claimants.”

° In June 2014, 11 months after Spain announced the New Regime, the
Government passed the necessary implementing regulation to fully define
the economic regime that would henceforth apply to RE installations. The
first measure was RD 413/2014 of 6 June 2014 as an implementing measure,
and the June 2014 Order that fixed the compensation parameters for a

standard installation.

304. Therefore, Spain’s treatment of the Claimants, its specific breaches of the ECT and the
interpretation of the standards in the ECT, according to the Claimants, must all be

viewed in the light of the above context, objectives and purposes of the ECT.

2. Respondent’s Position

305. Spain disputes the Claimants’ reading of the purpose of the ECT, as well as of the scope
of the FET, stating that the primary objective of the ECT is non-discrimination, and that
the ECT does not bar States from adopting reasonable macroeconomic control

measures.

306. The Respondent agrees with the Claimants that the protection standards of the ECT need
to be analysed in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms of the ECT in their
context and in light of the object and purpose of the ECT.*“* In this regard, the
Respondent argues that the protection that the ECT offers to investments is not an
unfettered one but rather it is to achieve a free energy market throughout Europe, based
on the principle of non-discrimination. Consequently, the primary or main objective

with respect to an investor is to “achieve the introduction of a free market in order to

34 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, J 853.

88

carry out energy-related activities without discrimination on account of the investor’s

nationality.”>°

307. The Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to address the real objectives and
principles established by the ECT, and which are applicable to this case pursuant to
Article 2 of the ECT. These objectives are: “foster the development of an efficient energy
market throughout Europe and a better functioning of the global market, based in both
cases in the principle of nondiscrimination and on a determination of prices based on
the market, taking into account the concerns expressed in relation to the

environment.” “6

308. The Respondent explains that the objective of non-discrimination has not been fully
achieved in the ECT. The Respondent argues that the reluctance of States to limit their
regulatory powers even minimally in such a strategic sector as the energy sector, led the
signatories of the ECT to differentiate two moments: (1) the so-called “making-
investment process” (paragraphs (2) and (3) of Article 10 of the ECT), in which the
conditions to ensure the objective of national treatment or non-discrimination were
postponed until the signing of a “‘supplementary treaty”, which has not yet been signed
and (2) the moment after the investment is made, when the guarantee of national
treatment and the most favoured nation clause are applied to the overseas investor, albeit

with certain limitations.>”

309. The Respondent affirms that once the investment has been made, the best standard of
protection afforded by the ECT to the investor and to foreign investments is the
“national treatment” standard. According to the Respondent, the greatest ambition of
the ECT is non-discrimination. In other words, when Article 10(1) of the ECT
establishes the obligation to give investments already made “‘no less favorable treatment

than that required by international law,” it recognises the minimum standard of

89

protection guaranteed by international law. The maximum aspiration of the ECT is,
according to Respondent, national treatment since this treatment will be applied to

overseas investments whenever it is more favourable.*“*

310. The Respondent alleges that Article 10 of the ECT contains a significant exception in
the area of public subsidies or aid.*#? According to the Respondent, this exception is
applicable to this case because the Claimants are requesting the payment of subsidies or

State aid for the production of electricity.*°°

311. The Respondent further alleges that Article 9 of the ECT provides that a State may adopt
measures which do not breach the non-discrimination principle if the regulatory
measure is (i) proportionate, (ii) justified on the grounds of public interest, and (iii)

applied without discrimination to both national and foreign investors.*>!

 

312. Spain asserts that in the absence of a specific stability commitment, an investor cannot
have an expectation that a regulatory framework will not be modified.*°? It finds a
support in the reading of the Energy Charter Treaty Guide which makes it very clear
that the ECT does not prevent States from exercising their macroeconomic control
power.*>? The Respondent argues that the Claimants were aware or should have been

aware of this.

On this matter, the Respondent concludes that the ECT establishes no more limits on
the regulatory power of the States than the minimum standards of international law, with
the objective of non-discrimination, and that even this treatment does not apply on the
subject of public subsidies or aid.*°4 In any case, the ECT allows the adoption of
macroeconomic control measures by the signatory States, based on reasons of public

interest.

MERITS

The Claimants allege that after the Disputed Measures were implemented, the system
left in place completely dismantled the prior legal framework applicable to the
Claimants’ companies. The Claimants say that the new regime was also plagued by
uncertainty, lack of transparency and long-term instability. The Government retained
the discretion to define the “return rate” and the right to change the remuneration regime

every six years with respect to existing installations.*°°

The Respondent sustains that it did not breach any international obligations under the
356

ECT and requests the Tribunal to fully dismiss the Claimants’ claims on the merits.

Article 10(1) of the ECT: Create Stable, Equitable, Favourable and Transparent

Conditions
1. Claimants’ Position

The Claimants note that the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT imposes upon
Spain the obligation to “encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions” for investors, particularly for sectors that require a substantial

amount of capital typically committed at the outset.°°7

317. The Claimants clarify that it is not their position that the obligation to accord “stable”
and “transparent” conditions in the ECT means that a host State must completely freeze
its regulatory regime. It does, however, according to the Claimants, mean that Spain
“knowingly accepted limitations on its regulatory power, in particular... its ability

fundamentally to alter the regulatory framework applicable to existing investments.”*>8

318. The Claimants understood that stability was important to renewable energy projects and
it was recognised in RD 661/2007 by offering investors certainty with respect to: (i) the
exact cents per kWh that renewable energy installations would receive per unit of
production;*° (ii) the sale of renewable energy installations’ entire production;> and

319. According to the Claimants, Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 was a self-binding
commitment of the Spanish regulator to protect existing installations against changes to
the FIT, otherwise permissible under Spanish law.*©? The stability of the regime was
supported, according to the Claimants, by Spain, including its own regulator, the
Comision Nacional de Energia, also known as CNE.*°3 Moreover, the Ministry of
Industry, Tourism and Commerce accompany the issuance of RD 661/2007 with a press

release indicating that “future adjustments to said tariffs will not affect installations

which are already in operation. This guarantees legal certainty for the electricity
producer and stability for the sector.”*°* The Claimants also refer to joint publications

from the Ministry, InvestInSpain,*® and ECOFYS.*

320. The Claimants stress that after RD 661/2007, Spain re-confirmed its commitment to
provide stable conditions in RD 1614/2010, establishing that any future changes to the
RD 661/2007 economic regime would not apply to duly registered, existing

installations.*°”

321. In the Claimants’ view, (i) the “roller coaster” of constant regulatory changes that the
Claimants’ investment was subject to over the 18-month period from December 2012
to June 2014;°% (ii) the total uncertainty that characterised the eleven-month “limbo”
period from July 2013 to June 2014;* as well as (iii) the system left in place marred
by “uncertainty, lack of transparency and long-term instability,’ provide sufficient
proof of Spain’s failure to encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions as required, according to the Claimants, by the first sentence of

Article 10(1) of the ECT.3”

322. First, the Claimants allege that in December 2012, Law 15/2012 imposed a 7% levy on
electricity produced and fed into the national grid during a calendar year, including all

generators, both conventional and renewable.>7!

323. Secondly, the Claimants state that just two months after Law 15/2012, in February 2013,
RDL 2/2013 deprived the Claimants of the most attractive support scheme option under
RD 661/2007, on which they relied when undertaking their investment: the Premium
option. The Premium had been a key part of the Claimants’ decision to invest, given the
possibility of maximizing revenues by way of selling to the market when demand in the
network was the highest. RDL 2/2013 also replaced the annual adjustment index based

on the Spanish CPI for updating the FIT to account for inflation.*””

324. The Claimants assert that four months later, Spain decided to repeal the RD 661/2007
FIT regime entirely. RDL 9/2013, of 12 July 2013, brought substantial changes to the
1997 Electricity Law by: (i) repealing RD 661/2007; and (ii) establishing a New Regime
for RE power-generation installations radically different from the framework

established by RD 661/2007 and effective as of the date of RDL 9/2013.37

325. The Claimants note that the New Regime was not fully defined or implemented until
June 2014. This meant that the entire RE sector had to endure 11 months of uncertainty
during which, according to the Claimants, it was impossible to discern the details of the
regulatory framework or the remuneration parameters to which the Project Companies

were or would be subject.

326. The Claimants sustain that in December 2013, Law 24/2013 introduced further harmful
measures: (i) the distinction between the Ordinary Regime and the Special Regime
announced by RDL 9/2013 formally disappeared; and (ii) conventional and RE
generators were put on an equal footing, thereby depriving the RE installations of the
unconditional right of priority of grid access and priority of dispatch that existed under
the previous regime.*”4 Moreover, Annex III established the applicability of the defined
“reasonable return” over the entire useful life of the plant, implementing a “maximum

degree” retroactivity. In this way, both the future and past income streams of the

Claimants were affected. This meant that: (i) the Project Companies would be penalised
for their past returns; and (ii) Spain introduced “maximum degree” retroactivity by
directly impacting the past income streams of the plant, effectively altering the rules of
the game over the energy already produced and already sold on the market by the

Claimants.>”°

Finally, the Claimants point out that in June 2014, 11 months after Spain announced the
New Regime, the Government passed the necessary implementing regulation to fully
define the economic regime that would henceforth apply to RE installations. The first

such implementing measure was RD 413/2014 of 6 June 2014.3”

By June 2014, according to the Claimants, none of the “key features of the regulatory
regime” in reliance of which the Claimants invested, remained.*”” In the Claimants’

view that was a “fundamental change.”>"8

2. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent objects to the Claimants’ characterization that there is an autonomous
standard of the FET generating an obligation to “create stable, equitable, favorable and

transparent conditions” for foreign investment. >”

Relying, inter alia, on the tribunals’ findings in /solux and Plama (both related to the
ECT),**° Spain disputes the Claimants’ assertion that Article 10(1) of the ECT contains

an autonomous standard to create stable conditions for investment.

331. Therefore, the Respondent analysed the obligation to create stable conditions within the

FET standard of the ECT, and not as an autonomous obligation.**!

B. Article 10(1) of the ECT: Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard
1. Claimants’ Position

332. For the Claimants, the ordinary meaning of Article 10(1), “read in good faith and in the
light of the object and purpose of the ECT,” demonstrates that the FET standard in the
ECT is an independent and autonomous standard.**? Therefore, the Claimants conclude,
the FET standard is additional to the international minimum standard under customary

international law.

333. In arbitral practice, the Claimants contend, “the preferred method [of application of the
FET] has been to unfold the standard on the basis of casuistic subgroups which will be
seen as typical emanations of the standards.”**? Accordingly, in the present case, the

Claimants submit that:

. Spain has breached the Claimants’ reasonable and legitimate expectations;

. Spain failed to provide a stable and predictable legal and business
framework in relation to the investment;**4

. Spain’s conduct has not been transparent;

. Spain’s measures are unreasonable and arbitrary,

. Spain’s measures are disproportionate and discriminatory.**°

384 Claimants clarify that “the ECT gives the obligation of the host State to provide stability in the first sentence of Article 10(1).
As such, it is a stand-alone obligation under the ECT and therefore addressed separately in Section 14.2 above. Importantly, the
FET standard contained in the second sentence of the ECT also encompasses an obligation on the host State to provide a stable
legal and business framework. This has been confirmed by numerous tribunals, as explained below. This obligation in the ECT
imposes a burden to provide stability that is more onerous than the FET obligation contained in a typical investment treaty given
the particular object and purpose of the ECT.” Claimants’ Memorial, { 405, fn. 563.

2. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent alleges that the Claimants have the burden to prove a breach of the FET

standard through the measures challenged.**°

The Respondent affirms that the Claimants do not invoke cases where the FET standard
was applied in ECT cases. Instead, according to the Respondent, the Claimants invoke
less relevant precedents that were rendered on the basis of breach of contracts or

administrative concessions in countries such as Mexico, Ecuador, Chile or Argentina.°*”

The Respondent further notes that arbitral tribunals that have applied the FET standard
under the ECT have held that such standard requires a balance between the investor’s
rights and the power and duty of the host state to adopt measures for the general

interest.78

The Respondent insists that the “Claimants had not justified: (i) the existence of a
‘grandfathering’ institution in Spanish Law, (ii) the existence of a ‘grandfathering’
commitment in the Spanish Regulatory framework not (iii) the existence of a
commitment by the Kingdom of Spain to petrify the retribution scheme of the RD
661/2007.”>*° Therefore, the Respondent argues, the Tribunal cannot conclude that

Spain has violated the FET standard contained in the ECT.*”°

Obligation to provide a stable and predictable regulatory scheme

Claimants contend that a “central feature of the State’s obligation to ensure FET for

investments is the general principle that the State must not frustrate a foreign investor’s
legitimate expectations on which that investor relied at the time it made its
investment.”*?! In particular, the Claimants maintain, “the ECT expressly recognizes an
obligation on the part of the host state to provide for legal stability,” as part of the host

State’s obligation to respect the investor’s legitimate expectations.**

339. This obligation, the Claimants pursue, is “of particular importance in the energy sector”
where, as in this case, a substantial amount of capital is invested at the outset in the hope

of generating a long-term return.

340. The Claimants note that it has been well-established that the State’s conduct, which
contributes to the creation of a reasonable expectation and upon which an investor relies,
may take the form of the legal framework in relation to, or surrounding the
investment.*”* The Claimants further explain that the legal framework on which the
investor is entitled to rely, comprises “/egislation and treaties, and assurances
contained in decrees, licences and similar executive assurances or undertakings,” as

stated in numerous awards, including Enron v. Argentina and LG&E v. Argentina.***

341. The Claimants argue that they had two distinct expectations: (i) one pertaining to the
nature, amount and duration of the FIT offered under RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010;
and (b) another pertaining to the stability of the RD 661/2007 economic regime,

expecting that any potential modifications to the regime would only apply prospectively,

leaving existing installations unaffected.*°°

342. First, regarding the nature, level and duration of the FIT, at the time the Claimants
invested in the Marmellar SL and La Boga SL, the Project Companies, they expected

that once the installations were finally registered with the RAIPRE:

a. the Project Companies would have a choice between selling electricity at a
Fixed Tariff or at the Premium, with the amounts that were set out in Article
36 of RD 661/2007;

b. the FIT would apply to all of the electricity produced, without any
limitations on production;

c. the FIT would apply for the entire operational life of the installations; and

d. the FIT would be subject to inflation adjustments, as provided in RD
661/2007.7%°

343. Secondly, in the Claimants’ view, Spain explicitly promised that the economic regime
for qualifying Special Regime installations would remain stable under RD 661/2007,
which contains a stabilization commitment in Article 44(3).*°’ According to the
Claimants, Spain subsequently reiterated this commitment in the July 2010
Agreement®”® and RD 1614/2010, which provided that any revisions to the Fixed Tariff
and the Premium pursuant to Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 would not affect duly
registered, existing installations. According to the Claimants, these ‘“‘stability

commitments” were core to the Claimants’ expectations.

344. The Claimants affirm that their expectations on the continued application of the RD
661/2007 economic regime for the Project Companies were legitimate and reasonable

due to the following:

38 Claimants’ Reply, { 101.

99

The RD 661/2007 FIT provided very specific tariffs that would apply to the
Project Companies. Article 36 specified the Fixed Tariff and Premium that
the Claimants would receive for 20 years and thereafter.

Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 committed not to change that Fixed Tariff or
the upper and lower thresholds of the Premium option for existing
installations. According to the Claimants, this commitment was later
reinforced in RD 1614/2010 by including the Premium itself within the
scope of the protection. According to the Claimants, this was a “self-
binding” commitment entered into by Spain in order to protect against
“minimum degree” retroactivity.

The RD 661/2007 economic regime was part of a wider international and
domestic policy to develop renewable energy power-generation
infrastructure. In the Claimants’ position, RD 661/2007 was the necessary
instrument for Spain to reach its renewable energy targets.

For the Claimants, the regime that Spain put in place was sufficiently
attractive to encourage the necessary investments in renewable energy

projects, such as the projects in which the Claimants invested. °°?

345. The Claimants also specify that Spain’s own conduct prior to the Claimants’ investment

confirms that Spain’s expectations on the application and stability of the RD 661/2007

economic regime were the same as the Claimants’ expectations. In the Claimants’ view,

clearly those expectations were reasonable.

400

346. The Claimants state that Spain advances a number of arguments, which are clear ex-post

constructs, regarding the RD 661/2007.*°! The Claimants argue that FIT schemes are

currently in place in at least 103 countries worldwide, including 25 European member

states. FITs are designed to provide long-term certainty as to the price at which

electricity from RE producers will be purchased. As repeatedly recognised by Spain,

FIT schemes seek to correct a market failure in order to induce investment in RE.
According to the Claimants, Spain enacted a FIT scheme fully in line with international
standard practice, offering a long-term guarantee to qualifying investors.*°? In the
Claimants’ view, Spain’s ex post arguments regarding the interpretation of the RD
661/2007 FIT disregard the stated object and purpose behind the economic regime.*
The Claimants affirm that rather than describing the regime as specifically designed to
induce investment through the provision of a stable regulatory framework, Spain now
presents the RD 661/2007 regime as providing merely a discretionary subsidy that the

Government was free to withdraw at any time for both new and existing installations.

347. The Claimants respond to Spain’s contention that Article 44.3 was not a stabilization
commitment or grandfathering provision because it did not say that an entirely new and
different norm could not be passed. 404 In the Claimants’ view, this makes no sense
because it also flatly contradicts Spain’s contemporaneous assurances concerning

Article 44.3 and the drafting process giving rise to the inclusion of Article 44.3.

348. The Claimants supported the argument that Article 44.3 was a “guarantee” against tariff
changes with documentation, including: (1) Ministry of Industry, Tourism and
Commerce's (“Ministry”) press release accompanying the issuance of RD 661/2007;*°
(2) CNE Report 3/2007 of 14 February 2007;*” (3) four separate publications where the

349. The Claimants also note that the evolution of the draft of the regulation that would
ultimately become RD 661/2007 also confirms that the inclusion of the stability
commitment at Article 44.3 was deliberate to provide an important guarantee to

investors. 4!

350. In the first draft of RD 661/2007 the stabilization clause was not present*!? and,
according to the Claimants, the CNE urged the Ministry to include a protection against
tariff changes for existing installations in the new regulation. The Ministry, the
Claimants argue, evidently accepted the CNE’s position and included this special
provision in the next draft of RD 661/2007 dated 19 March 2007, which became Article
44.3414

351. The Claimants counter Spain’s argument that Article 44.3 only protected installations
against tariff revisions made “in the periodic reviews every four years” and that Spain

was therefore free to make wholesale changes to the incentive regime at any other time.

According to the Claimants, that interpretation is absurd and is against the plain

language of Article 44.3.4!°

Moreover, the Claimants sustain that the fact that RD 661/2007 is a “Royal Decree”
and, therefore, subject to change by another law or regulation, is irrelevant. According
to the Claimants, the question for the Tribunal is not whether Spanish law allowed a
“Royal Decree” to be amended by subsequent legislation, but, rather, whether the
Claimants had an expectation that Spain would not make retroactive changes to the RD
661/2007 FIT applicable to the Wind Farms, much less overhaul the remuneration

regime altogether. *!°

Any law or regulation in Spain (or, indeed, anywhere else) can, as a matter of domestic
law, be changed or repealed by a subsequent act of equal or higher rank. The 1997
Electricity Law itself was modified 35 times during the 16 years it was in force. This,
according to the Claimants, does not change the fact that a regulation can give rise to

legitimate expectations.*!”

In response to Spain’s argument that the Claimants knew or should have known that
Spain could introduce retroactive changes to the regulation applicable to their
investment, changes that would entirely overhaul the parameters for remuneration of the

Wind Farms, as the Disputed Measures did, the Claimants respond as follows:

a. A guarantee in which one party can unilaterally modify the key terms —
including the return that the other party may earn — is clearly no guarantee
at all. This is not how FITs work generally nor is it consistent with the terms
of RD 436/2004, RD 661/2007, or RD 1614/2010. These regulations

expressly exempted registered installations from future tariff revisions.*!®

b. Had Spain implemented a dynamic rate of return, it would not have been
able to attract RE investment. This is because most of the investment in
wind farms is made up front and can only be repaid after many years.*!”

c. Regarding Spain’s claim that the reference in the 1997 Electricity Law to
the cost of money on the capital markets (i.e. interest rates) should have put
the Claimants on notice that retroactive changes could be made if there was
achange in interest rates. Claimants respond that the only reference to “cost
of money on the capital markets” in RD 661/2007 is in Article 44.3, i.e. in
relation to tariffs to be set for new plants. That was a clear confirmation by
Spain that interest rates would play a role in the future, but that changes in
interest rates would not affect existing plants.*”°

d. The dynamic character allegedly “makes it possible to determine whether
profitability at a given time is reasonable or not.” According to the
Claimants, not a single contemporaneous document supports this.
Moreover, the Claimants state that Spain never made any finding that the

Wind Farms were being unreasonably profitable.*?!

355. Spain stated in its Counter-Memorial that the due diligence made by the Claimants, was
flawed, leading to their misunderstanding of the regulatory framework, which is denied
by the Claimants, pointing out to the documents relied upon to make the investment.*”?
Also, according to the Claimants, Spain states that “the Claimant made an investment

without knowing the essential aspects of the Spanish regulatory _framework.?*3

356. In response to the Respondent’s statement that the Claimants should have anticipated
the Disputed Measures because the Spanish Supreme Court “since 2005, establishes the

rights of investors in the event of changes in the remuneration models of the [Special

Regime]”, the Claimants respond that Spain refers to a number of judgments that post-

date the Claimants’ investment, which are irrelevant to this dispute.*”4

357. The Claimants contend that the judgments that pre-date the Claimants’ decision to
invest, relate to incentives that were not part of the guaranteed renewable energy regime
and so cannot have constituted the Claimants’ expectations.*?> In the Claimants’ view,
there is no judicial interpretation of the meaning of the specific clauses in the legislation
whereby Spain undertook to respect existing investors’ rights, i.e., Article 40.3 of RD
436/2004, Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 or Article 5.3 of RD 1614/2010. Indeed,
according to the Claimants, Spain has not been able to provide any judicial support for
its strained interpretation of these provisions. Equally, according to Claimants, no
Spanish judgment has ever held that the “reasonable return” concept is “dynamic.”*6

That is the reason why the cases invoked by Spain were not flagged by the Claimants’

legal advisors despite the Claimants’ thorough due diligence in the regulatory regime

prior to investing.*?’

358. The Claimants reiterated this point when they addressed Spain’s request to introduce
the RREEF Decision into the record. In this regard, the Claimants disagreed that there
was a consolidated trend of ECT cases as portrayed by Spain but rather to the contrary,
in the Eiser, Masdar, Novenergia, Antin and Greentech awards, Spain was found to have
“(i) introduced investors to invest in Spanish RE with the implementation of a favourable
regime; and (ii) significantly changed the fundamentals of that Regime through the New

Regime, thus breaching the ECT.”*8

The Claimants also point out that the Supreme Court’s review is limited to consider
whether a Royal Decree or Ministerial Order complies with higher-ranking norms.*”°
As far as the Supreme Court’s analysis is concerned, once a Royal Decree has been
replaced, its provisions no longer exist.**° In other words, according to the Claimants,
unless the derogated provision is contained in a higher-ranking law, the Supreme Court

cannot consider whether that provision has been violated.**!

2. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that in order to determine if there has been a violation of the
FET standard, the Tribunal must assess the legitimate expectations that the Claimants
had when making the investment in relation to the treatment that the said investment
would receive. These expectations must be reasonable and objective with respect to the
general regulatory framework in place. As part of this assessment, the Respondent asks
the Tribunal to first analyse the investor’s knowledge of the general regulatory
framework when making its investment, or rather, what this knowledge should have

included.

The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ investment was made in May 2012 and

not in August 2011.47?

According to the Respondent, the following events should be relevant for the Tribunal’s
assessment: (a) the announcement of future regulatory changes made by Mr. Mariano
Rajoy in his inauguration speech as President; (b) the CNE’s press release dated 28

December 2011 urging a reform;** (c) RDL 1/2012, issued on 27 January, announcing

how this is applied (iii) how it affects its investment. An investor makes its investment

such, “4!

364. According to Spain, every investor must know or should have known the essential
conditions of the Special Regime remuneration system and the jurisprudence of the

Supreme Court.”

365. In Spain’s view, it is the Claimants’ obligation to be informed of the general regulatory
framework that governs investments, and which includes all regulations and
jurisprudence applicable to the investment. The Respondent alleges that the Claimants

do not provide evidence of having had the degree of diligence that could be expected

from a foreign investor in a heavily regulated sector like the energy industry, where
thorough prior analysis of the legal framework applicable thereto is essential to make

an investment.“

The Respondent argues that, even if the Claimants had actually performed an exhaustive
due diligence, Spain has not violated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations. The
Respondent sustains that arbitral tribunals have confirmed that the ECT is not a type of
insurance policy of investors against the risk of changes in a regulatory framework.*##
Therefore, the Respondent further argues, the Claimants neither (a) had a specific
commitment by the Kingdom of Spain nor (b) the Claimant’s expectations were

reasonable or justified.*4>

The Respondent asserts that an interpretation that requires immutability of the
regulatory framework, irrespective of the ensuing economic circumstances, apart from
not being realistic, would infringe the concept of fair and equitable treatment, as is

internationally conceived.**°

Spain affirms that the standard that the Claimants’ claim has to be considered is within
the FET standard of the ECT, as stated by the Tribunal in the Plama case: “stable and
equitable conditions are clearly part of the fair and equitable treatment standard under

the ECT."47

The Respondent notes that according to consolidated arbitral case-law on the ECT, the

“stable conditions” referred to by the ECT clearly allow the adoption of reasonable and

proportionate macroeconomic control measures, provided these are as a result of a

reasonable cause.“

370. The Respondent affirms that the measures challenged by the Claimants are based on the
need to guarantee the sustainability and balance of the SES and were carried out
respecting the principle that governed this type of investment according to the 1997
Electricity Law: the granting of a fair return that the 2005-2010 Spanish Renewable
Energy Plan (“REP”), in harmony with the 2000-2010 REP, calculated to ensure that

standard facilities could achieve a return of around 7% during their useful life.4?

371. The Respondent affirms that the costs of the electrical system have evolved
exponentially according to the evolution of investments in the various activities,

particularly in transportation, distribution and generation.*°

372. The trend shows that all the costs of the SES were multiplied by 3.2 between 2006 and
2013; and that the income, despite the fall in demand, was multiplied by 2, by increasing

the electricity bills paid by consumers. The Respondent describes the tariff deficit as the

difference between revenues and costs.**!

373. The Respondent affirms that this deficit has generated an accumulated debt which
reached 40,326 million euros. Although this debt has been amortised gradually, in 2015

the amount remaining was still over 26,000 million euros. The Respondent establishes

that this debt is being paid by Spanish consumers on electricity bills at a rate of about

2,800 million euros annually.4?

Spain asserts that the model of remuneration derived from the Spanish regulatory
framework as a whole was planned with the aim that all investors could recover, taking
as areference a “standard installation,” (1) the cost of their investment, (2) the operating
costs and (3) obtain reasonable profitability.*°? Consequently, the Respondent affirms
that it has granted the Claimants stable conditions according to the ECT’s standard, as
with the contested measures it has maintained the essential characteristics of the
regulatory framework in which the Claimants invested. Following the 2013 reform, the
Kingdom of Spain establishes that it has maintained the subsidies and the dispatch
priority, allowing RE investments to recover, in accordance with the “standard
facilities”: (i) investment costs, (ii) operating costs and additionally, (iii) obtain
reasonable profitability in accordance with the cost of money in the capital market. In
summary, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants maintain the financial balance of

the investment.*™*

Furthermore, the Respondent contends that it is not possible to talk about the violation
of stable conditions since the profitability renewable energy producers can hope to

achieve was determined by Law following RDL 9/2013.4°

Moreover, Spain concluded that the Claimants’ arguments contradict with the results
obtained with the sale of their assets in 2016. The assets subject of this arbitration were
sold to a third party by the Claimants. With such sale, the Claimants have obtained a

return of 11.2%. Such return is above that expected when making the investment.*°

377. According to the Respondent, the Claimants, by explaining their theory, make a new,
basic and conceptual error for a regulation to be retroactive, it must affect acquired
rights. Spain argues that based on the facts in the record, it can be concluded that the
Claimants have never had an “acquired right” to any future remuneration, sine die, by
means of a fixed and unchangeable FIT, not subject to possible measures of
macroeconomic control or SES reforms. Spain affirms that the reform contained in RDL

9/2013 only affected the future, without affecting acquired rights.*°”

378. The Respondent further states that the Supreme Court and the State Council ratified the
legality of the legislative modifications which apply to the future, without affecting the
acquired rights. According to Spain, that doctrine is the same as the one applied by the

international arbitration tribunals.*°*

379. The Respondent alleges that the Disputed Measures “maintained the essential features
of the regulatory framework in which Claimants took the decision to invest: (i) they
guarantee the priority of access to the grid, (ii) they guarantee the priority of dispatch
and (iii) they guarantee a reasonable return on the investment according to the cost of

money in the capital markets.”*?

380. Furthermore, when commenting on the RREEF Decision, Spain called for the case law
which indicated that the “regulatory framework...does not include stabilisation clauses
or compromises to the investors to maintain unchanged regulation approved in order
to promote the renewable energies.”*°° Spain, supported on what it argued to be the

analysed in the light of the public legitimate purpose that justifies their approva
381. Accordingly, Respondent concludes, it has not breached its obligation to maintain a

stable and predictable regulatory framework.
D. Alleged frustration of legitimate expectations
1. Claimants’ Position

382. According to the Claimants, their expectations were both legitimate and reasonable,
because they relied, inter alia, on Spain’s general policy aiming to develop renewable
energy power-generation infrastructure, Spain’s active campaign to reach these goals,
or the enactment by Spain of regulations confirming that installations, such as the Wind

Farms, would not be affected by any review of the FIT under RD 661/2007.4

383. The Claimants conclude that by adopting the Disputed Measures described supra, and
in particular, “by wiping out the RD 661/2007 economic regime in its entirety in July
2013 (under RDL 9/2013), and introducing an entirely differently regime that is
substantially less favourable to the Claimants,’ Spain frustrated the Claimants’

legitimate expectations, in breach of the FET under the ECT.*%

384. The Claimants affirm that the Spanish authorities, having knowingly sought out and
induced investments on the basis of these specific representations and undertakings,

hastily withdrew them after the investments had been made.**

385. According to the Claimants, Spain has, since December 2012, through a process

extending over two years and comprising a succession of harmful measures, frustrated

the Claimants’ legitimate expectations and entirely dismantled the legal and business

framework on which the Claimants relied in making their investment.*°

First, the Claimants allege that in December 2012, Law 15/2012 imposed a 7% levy on
electricity produced and fed into the national grid during a calendar year, including all

generators, both conventional and renewable. 466

Secondly, the Claimants state that just two months after Law 15/2012, in February 2013,
RDL 2/2013 deprived the Claimants of the most attractive support scheme option under
RD 661/2007, on which they relied when undertaking their investment: the Premium
option. According to the Claimants, the Premium had been a key part of their decision
to invest, given the possibility of maximizing revenues by way of selling to the market
when demand in the network was the highest. RDL 2/2013 also replaced the annual
adjustment index based on the Spanish CPI for updating the FIT to account for

inflation.*7

The Claimants assert that four months later, Spain decided to repeal the RD 661/2007
FIT regime entirely. RDL 9/2013, of 12 July 2013, brought substantial changes to the
1997 Electricity Law by: (i) repealing RD 661/2007; and (ii) establishing a New Regime
for RE power-generation installations radically different from the framework

established by RD 661/2007 and effective as of the date of RDL 9/2013.4%

The Claimants note that the New Regime was not fully defined or implemented until
June 2014. This meant that the entire RE sector had to endure 11 months of uncertainty

during which, according to the Claimants, it was impossible to discern the details of the

regulatory framework or the remuneration parameters to which the Project Companies

were or would be subject.

390. The Claimants sustain that in December 2013, Law 24/2013 introduced further harmful
measures: (i) the distinction between the Ordinary Regime and the Special Regime
announced by RDL 9/2013 formally disappeared; and (ii) conventional and renewable
energy generators were put on an equal footing, thereby depriving the RE installations
of the unconditional right of priority of grid access and priority of dispatch that existed
under the previous regime. Moreover, Annex III established the applicability of the
defined “reasonable return” over the entire useful life of the plant, implementing a
“maximum degree” retroactivity. In this way, both the future and past income streams
of the Claimants were affected. This meant that: (i) the Project Companies would be
penalised for their past returns; and (ii) Spain introduced “maximum degree”
retroactivity by directly impacting the past income streams of the plant, effectively
altering the rules of the game over the energy already produced and already sold on the

market by the Claimants.*”°

391. According to the Claimants, the New Regime is retroactive. The Claimants use the term
retroactive to refer to measures that apply to investments that have already been
made.*7! The Claimants state that under Spanish law, there are broadly two forms of
retroactivity. The first is “improper” (or “minimum degree”) retroactivity, which is
generally permissible under Spanish law. Applying new tariffs to existing installations
for the remainder of their useful life is a case of improper retroactivity, i.e. a change in
the law that affects a pre-existing situation. The second is “genuine” (or “maximum
degree”) retroactivity, which occurs under Spanish law and under most legal systems
when the regulation not only affects pre-existing situations but also affects activities or
results that have already occurred in the past (in this case, the electricity already

produced, sold on the market, and for which the tariffs or premiums have already been

paid).*”? The Claimants note that Spain stresses that the Disputed Measures are
permissible under Spanish law because they do not involve a “maximum degree” of
retroactivity. However, the Claimants assert that Spain introduced genuinely retroactive
changes since the Disputed Measures “claw-back” past revenues. The Claimants sustain
that although the Project Companies were not required to pay back any “excess”
amounts received in the past beyond the newly-imposed cap of the 7.398% “reasonable
return’ over the lifetime of their plants, the New Regime does discount the “excess”

from future payments, which in practice is precisely the same thing.*”>

Finally, the Claimants point out that in June 2014, 11 months after Spain announced the
New Regime, the Government passed the necessary implementing regulation to fully
define the economic regime that would henceforth apply to RE installations. The first

such implementing measure was RD 413/2014 of 6 June 2014.4

By June 2014, according to the Claimants, none of the key features of the regulatory
regime in reliance of which the Claimants invested, remained. In the Claimants’ view

that was a fundamental change.*”>

In the Claimants’ position, the complete upheaval of a given regulatory regime may

result in a violation of the FET standard, such as the Micula tribunal understood.*”°

According to the Claimants, similarly to Micula, in the present case, Article 36 of RD
661/2007 provided that the FIT would be available for a specified amount for kWh of
electricity produced “for the first 20 years” of a wind installation’s life and then
“thereafter” for a different, lower amount for each kWh produced in subsequent years.

RD 661/2007 went beyond this by providing a “guarantee” at Article 44(3) of RD

661/2007 that, once registered and in operation, any reviews of that FIT would only
affect future wind installations, which was later confirmed by RD 1614/2010. 477
However, in the Claimants’ view, only a few years after RD 661/2007 was enacted,
Spain has eviscerated all of its key characteristics. It has reneged on its promises,
thereby frustrating the Claimants’ legitimate expectations and upsetting the legal

framework it had previously guaranteed.*”*

The Claimants further supported their argument when commenting on the RREEF
Decision. The Claimants pointed out that the RREEF tribunal found that the disputed
measures lowered the rate of return by radically altering the regulatory regime in
reliance on which the Claimants had invested.” The Claimants also note that the
tribunal in RREEF concluded that the retroactive nature of the new regime breached
Art. 10(1) of the ECT and that “must result in an appropriate compensation for the

damage that the breach caused the Claimants.”**°

2. Respondent’s Position

As regards the legitimate expectations under the FET standard of the ECT, Spain

highlights that such expectations must be “reasonable” and “objective.”**!

In Spain’s view, the Claimants’ reliance on the “alleged stabilisation commitments”
contained in the Spanish regulatory framework, particularly, in Articles 36 and 44.3 of
RD 661/2007 and Article 5.3 of RD 1614/2010 is neither reasonable nor objective. The
regulatory framework only guaranteed that renewable energy facilities, during their

useful life, could achieve a reasonable profitability.

399, For Spain, in sum, the Claimants (i) “could not have the legitimate expectation that the
Spanish regulatory framework for supporting renewables would remain unchanged if
the economic sustainability of the SES was at risk,” (ii) nor that “the regime for
supporting renewables based on set economic parameters would remain unchanged if
said economic parameters changed radically, as was the case in Spain from 2009 to
2014,”4*? and (iii) “the agreement of 2 July 2010 does not mean a commitment of
immovability of RD 661/2007,” rather, the agreement was “the result of a process of
consultations imposed by article 24 of the Act of Governance, which regulates the

process of preparing the regulations in Spain.”**

400. In support of this position, Spain relies on the awards in Charanne and Isolux which
have, according to Spain, both confirmed that “RD 661/2007 did not contain promises
or guarantees of freezing regulations in favour of investors such as the Claimant[{s] or

their investments.”**4

401. Furthermore, Spain expresses that the lack of existence of a specific commitment has
already been declared by the tribunal in the Charanne case, which examined the existing
legal framework in the electricity sector during 2007 and 2008 in Spain.**° This award
has corroborated what the Kingdom of Spain claims and what RE Associations in the
sector argued in 2009 and 2010: that RD 661/2007 did not contain any promises or
guarantees of freezing of its regime. The contention on the part of Spain means that
neither (i) the remunerative regime nor (ii) the regime of hours or years of subsidised

production nor (iii) the tariff update regime, were set in stone.*8°

402. The Respondent stresses that no fully informed investor could expect the freezing in its

favour of all of these regimes due to the fact of fulfilling a regulatory requirement to

obtain subsidies, such as registration in a mandatory administrative register. Nor could
they expect these conditions be maintained indefinitely or be improved in the absence

of any commitment in this regard.

The Respondent states that the most evident proof that the Claimants knew before
making their investment about the possibility of regulatory changes is precisely the sale
and purchase agreement whereby the Claimants acquired their investment, which
expressly foresees the possibility of regulatory changes and it is agreed that the sellers

will not be liable for those regulatory changes, whether retroactive or not.*8”

The Respondent argues that the expectations upheld by the Claimant with regard to the
setting in stone are not consistent either with the basic principles over which the Spanish
regulatory framework is based or with the evolution of the Spanish regulatory

framework in the years prior to the Claimants’ investment.

The Spanish regulatory framework had the following essential principles: (1) The
regulatory system governed by the principle of regulatory hierarchy and the result of the
legally stipulated procedures for drafting regulations; (2) The regulatory framework is
not limited to RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010 as claimed by the Claimants, but rather
configured from the 1997 Electricity Law and the regulations which developed it, as
interpreted by case-law; (3) The fundamental principle that subsidies to the Special
Regime, are a cost for the Spanish Electricity System (“SES”), subordinate to the
principle of its economic sustainability; (4) Right to the priority access and dispatch of
electricity production; (5) That the remuneration of the RE consists of a subsidy which,
added to the market price, provides renewable energy plants with reasonable
profitability, in the framework of its useful life, in accordance with the capital market,
which is dynamic and balanced within the SES and the profitability was linked
exclusively to the cost of construction and operation of the plants; (6) That the

determination of the subsidies is fixed on the basis of changing demand and other basic

Respondent’ s Counter-Memorial, {| 608.

118

economic data, set out in the RE Plans on the costs of investment and operation of
standard installations with the objective that these installations achieve reasonable
profitability during their useful life, and (7) That the regulatory changes to the
remuneration regime of REs since 2004 have been motivated by (i) correcting situations
of over-payment, or (ii) by the strong alteration of the economic data that served as the

basis for the estimate of the subsidies.“**

406. The Respondent observes that these basic principles constitute the objective legitimate
expectations of a diligent investor. Therefore, no diligent investor could expect the
Spanish State, faced with a situation of economic deficit or imbalance that affected the
sustainability of the SES, not to adopt measures to be able to resolve such. In the same
way, no investor would expect that in a situation of “over-remuneration” the State
would not correct this situation. The /eit motiv inherent to all of the measures has been,
precisely, to address that situation of unsustainability of the SES and correct situations

of over-remuneration, preventing consumers from exclusively bearing the costs.

407. The Respondent establishes that the Claimants make an unnecessary argument so that
all of its expectations revolve around Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007. According to the
Respondent, paragraph 2 of Article 44.3 RD 661/2007: (a) It says nothing about
“updates”, “‘feed-in hours”, “operational life of plants” or “priority dispatch”, nor the
remaining elements of the legal regime applicable to plants, (b) neither does it refer to
“any” review of tariffs. Its wording is limited to the periodic reviews of the previous
paragraph, nothing else. And the previous paragraph does not guarantee that “the tariffs
shall remain in force, unchangeable except in the periodic reviews every four years”.
Accordingly, “any” modification that is not obligatory is excluded from the sphere of
article 44.3. That is, it excludes the modifications that are necessary to (1) ensure the
economic sustainability of the SES or (2) to correct situations of over-remuneration. In
Respondent’s view, this has been the clear interpretation of the Supreme Court since

2005.48°

408. Moreover, in Spain’s view, the Claimants refer to four PowerPoint presentations that
allegedly reinforced its expectations, from 2007 to 2009. According to Spain, the
Claimants are unable to substantiate these presentations which, in any case, are at least
two years prior to its investment in Spain. Accordingly, the Respondent states that the

relevance for its expectations is zero.”

409. The Respondent notes that the award of the case ECE Projektmanagement v. Czech
Republic*' declared that legitimate expectations could hardly be generated based on
statements made by subjects lacking the capacity or the competence to be able to comply

with that stated.

410. Also, the Respondent considers that the Court of the Charanne case has already
dismissed the possibility of the information contained in advertising brochures being

capable of generating a real, objective expectation for a diligent investor.*””

411. Moreover, to further substantiate its contention that the expectations of the Claimants
were neither reasonable nor objective, Spain notes that (i) the Claimants have not
conducted proper legal diligence;*” (ii) the rest of reports obtained by the Claimants
prior to their investment did not acknowledge the alleged immutability of the

remuneration regime;** and (iii) the po:

 

ibility of regulatory changes was expressly

 

provided for in the contracts for the acquisition of the investment.*>

412. Lastly, the Respondent negates the existence of any stabilization commitment with

respect to the Claimants. According to the Claimants, the alleged commitments arising

The Respondent categorically denies that any of these constitute a commitment with

respect to the Claimants.*°°

413. First, the evolution of the Spanish legal framework had occurred before the Claimants
made their investment, which proved that no such stabilization existed from the

7

regulation.*°? Second, the Respondent argues, the Claimants invested in a highly

regulated sector. Therefore, the rights and obligations come from a regulation and are

not derived from contracts. °*

Third, this was also reflected by the repeated
jurisprudence from the Spanish Supreme Court even before the Claimants made their
investment.*”? Fourth, the Respondent argues that the Claimants had invested in a
highly liberalised market which purpose and limits to subsidies cannot be

disregarded.>°°

414. Spain submitted further comments on legitimate expectations on the basis of the
introduction into the record of the RREEF Decision.*°! According to the Respondent in
the RREEF case, “claimants in that proceeding could not legitimately expect that the
rules applicable to their investments would remain unchanged for the entire duration of
the plants, but their legitimate expectation was limited to a reasonable return on their
investments.”*°? The Respondent also refers to the RREEF Decision to explain what the
investor can expect a “reasonable return” according to the cost of money in the capital

market.>%

E. Transparency
1. Claimants’ Position

415. Relying, in particular, on Plama, Electrabel and Tecmed, the Claimants contend that the
FET standard further requires that the State’s conduct towards investors and its legal
environment be transparent. In the Claimants’ view, Spain’s conduct, in adopting the
Disputed Measures, was characterised by uncertainty and ambiguity, thus in breach of

the requirement of transparency under the FET.

416. In the Claimants’ position, the reference to transparency in the ECT can be read to
indicate an obligation to be forthcoming with information about intended changes in
policy and regulations that may significantly affect investments, so that the investor can
adequately plan its investment and, if needed, engage the host State in dialogue about

protecting its legitimate expectations.°™

417. In the present case, the Claimants stated that Spain dismantled the RD 661/2007

economic regime in a manner that was not transparent.*°>

418. First, the Claimants raised that the Government abused the function of Royal Decree
Laws to implement the New Regime. The ability to issue Royal Decree Laws applies
only in cases of “extraordinary and urgent need.” There was, however, no “need” for
RD 661/2007 to be modified by way of Royal Decree Law. It is therefore reasonable to
assume that the only reason Spain implemented the New Regime via Royal Decree Law

was to deprive stakeholders of the possibility to influence or challenge the measure.

5% The Claimants find support of its position in the following cases: Técnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S. A. v The United
Mexican States, (CSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003, 154, Exhibit CL-33; Electrabel S.A. v The Republic of

Exhibit CL-63.

 

505 Claimants’ Memorial, {[ 437.

419.

Secondly, the Claimants note that RDL 9/2013 not only wiped out the investment
regime for the Claimants’ investment, but was followed by a transitory regime of more
than 11 months during which the Government gave no indication regarding the precise

remuneration that any qualifying plants would be entitled to.

Thirdly, the Claimants recall that with the necessary implementing measures of June
2014 (i.e. 11 months after RDL 9/2013 was introduced), the Government was meant to
define the precise economic regime that would apply to qualifying installations.
However, neither RD 413/2014 nor the June 2014 Order provide any transparent
analysis explaining the underlying criteria or calculations behind the Special Payment
(including how the standard costs of the standard installation were calculated), or those

that will underpin the future updates of the economic regime.

Fourthly, the Claimants consider that under the New Regime, the Government also
retains the right to review the Special Payment in order to make sure that the prevailing
yield on ten-year Spanish bonds plus a spread (i.e. what Spain considers to be a
“reasonable return” or rather will consider to be a “reasonable return” in the future)

continues to apply.

In the Claimants’ view, the New Regime does not provide any clear indication as to the
timeframe during which the remuneration for installed capacity (which is in theory
aimed at compensating for investments made in the installations) will apply. According
to the Claimants’ Memorial, the Government has also not provided any transparent
methodology for determining whether a plant has, in the Government’s view, earned

reasonable profits.

The Claimants state that Spain selectively refers to the annulment committee decision
in the MTD v. Chile case to contend that a host State’s obligations cannot solely stem
from the investor's expectations. However, according to the Claimants, nowhere have
the Claimants in this case stated that their claim arises out of their own expectations

only. The legitimate expectations of the Claimants were not just subjectively held but

123

objectively legitimate. In the Claimants’ view, this is clearly recognised in the
annulment committee decision in MTD v. Chile.*°° The Claimants sustain that a proper

507

reading of the annulment committee decision in MTD v. Chile?’ illustrates that it did

not “question” the Tecmed v. Mexico award as Spain claims.

2. Respondent’s Position

Likewise, Spain argues that it had not breached its obligation under the ECT to provide
transparent conditions. In this context, Spain points out that the need to adopt measures
with the view of eliminating the tariff deficit (i) had been announced and known to all

8

investors, *°8 and (ii) the Disputed Measures were thus neither obscure nor

unpredictable.*?

According to the Respondent, the Claimants once again make the mistake of considering
that the ECT guarantees the full predictability of the regulatory framework of a State

while the investment is in effect even when there is no commitment to maintain it.

The Respondent states that the announcement of a reform to the SES, as part of the
macroeconomic control measures, was made more than one year prior to its actual

adoption, i.e. from December 2011.5! The Respondent further alleges that:

i it has never committed itself to the Claimants to keep its regulatory
framework immutable or the regime established in RD 661/2007;

ii. it has publicised the need to carry out reforms since 2009 as a result of the
international crisis and the necessary sustainability of the system. The

Respondent states that RDL 6/2009, the Report of RD 1614/2010 and RDL

the RE Associations themselves proposed the reform of the sector in 2009,
2010 and 2012, and even proposed the text of a new Law for RE in 2009.
Additionally, announcements for a new Electricity Sector Law were made
by the Government constantly since December 2011;

it has followed the legally established procedures in all the measures taken
since 2009, without incurring undue delays and ensuring participation in the
legislative process of the holders of legitimate rights;

it has approved a predictable, dynamic regulatory system that continues to
guarantee reasonable returns for RE projects and the financial balance of
the investment;>!!

transparency under Article 10(1) of the ECT.

F. Obligation of Reasonableness, Proportionality, and Alleged Discriminatory

Character of the Measures
1. Claimants’ Position

428. The Claimants mention that the tribunal in Plama v. Bulgaria®'* defined “unreasonable”
measures as “those which are not founded in reason or fact but on caprice, prejudice or
personal preference.” A determination of whether a State's conduct has been reasonable
requires demonstration that the conduct “bears a reasonable relationship to some

rational policy” >'®

429. Thus, in the Claimants’ view, in order for Spain to justify the measures at issue, it must
first identify a rational policy goal and then it must show that the measures taken were
reasonable, i.e. reasonably correlated, or appropriately tailored, to addressing that policy
goal with due regard for the consequences imposed on foreign investors such as the
Claimants.>!” In addition, the Claimants request that the Tribunal assess whether the
Disputed Measures were necessary in the light of alternatives available to the Disputed
Measures and whether, balancing the aim of the State against the significant financial

burden on the Claimants, the Disputed Measures are justified.*!*

430. The Claimants contend that there is a disagreement between the Parties on the burden
of proof. Spain suggests that the Claimants must show that: (a) the Disputed Measures
were unreasonable and disproportionate; and (b) the alternatives to addressing the tariff
deficit have “/egal, economic and budgetary validity.” According to the Claimants,
proportionality is only relevant where a State has interfered with an investor's rights.

The proportionality enquiry provides the State with an opportunity to explain why,

notwithstanding that its measures have interfered with an investor’s rights, the
interference is nevertheless justified because it is proportionate. The very nature of the
test means that the burden rests with the State. In the Claimants’ view, Spain fails to

meet that burden. *!°

According to the Claimants, Spain’s dismantling of the entire legal and business
framework applicable to the Claimants’ investment is contrary to the expectations of the

Claimants and, indeed, of any reasonable person.>2?

Spain’s stated justification for the regulatory measures adopted against the Project
Companies, is that the measures had to be adopted due to the so-called tariff deficit. In
the Claimants’ view, the tariff deficit is, however, the result of Spain’s own regulatory
decisions, and the burden of fixing it cannot be attributed to foreign investors protected
under the ECT, such as the Claimants, in violation of their reasonable and legitimate

expectations.*?!

The Claimants affirm that the reason why the tariff deficit developed is quite simple:
Spain has consistently failed to raise regulated tariffs to the level necessary to cover the
costs of the SES, even though, under its own laws, it was under an obligation to abide

by the income-sufficiency principle, as confirmed by the Spanish Supreme Court.>”?

The Claimants argue that on any view, tackling the tariff deficit by adopting sudden and

drastic changes to the regulatory regime for renewables is not a rational policy goal.°*

435. Moreover, according to the Claimants, Spain’s measures under the New Regime were
unreasonable in the light of the limited contribution of wind to the tariff deficit. The
Claimants state that there were various other measures that could have been taken by
the Government that would have been far less harmful to the Claimants’ investment.>”4
Spain fails to discharge its burden of showing that there was no other less intrusive way

to address the tariff deficit.>*°

436. The Claimants contend that the tariff deficit could have been avoided had Spain properly
set consumer prices as it was required to do as a matter of Spanish law under Article 17
of the 1997 Electricity Law and RDL 6/2009°”° and that the Spanish Supreme Court has
issued several judgments and two sets of interim measures finding that Spain's failure

to comply with the requirements of RDL 6/2009 was a clear violation of Spanish law.>””

437. The Claimants state that although Spain appears to accept that the aim of the Disputed
Measures was to address the tariff deficit, Spain then seeks to expand the scope of the
purpose of the Disputed Measures beyond the tariff deficit.*?* However, the Claimants
understand that all the other reasons mentioned by Spain are potential justifications for

addressing the tariff deficit as the overarching policy goal.

438. The Claimants sustain that Spain failed to set Network Access Tolls at sufficient levels
for plainly political reasons. As such, the tariff deficit continued to worsen and with it
the potential burden on consumers. Rather than complying with its own laws, Spain,

who is responsible for balancing the budget, watched the deficit grow over a period of

avoid “excessive returns” and relies on the award in AES Summit v. Hungary to support
its view that addressing “/uxury profits” is a rational policy aim. However, in the
Claimants’ view, there is a significant hurdle that Spain cannot overcome in this regard:
The Disputed Measures were not designed to address the alleged excessive profits nor
has Spain sought to show that the Claimants were receiving returns in excess of what
Spain considered reasonable under RD 661/2007. The Claimants state that no analysis
on “excessive returns” was undertaken at the time the Disputed Measures were

implemented; nor is there any analysis before this Tribunal.

440. The Claimants assert that the economic crisis (and the corresponding decrease in
demand) had already affected Spain when it opted to implement RD 1614/2010, which
reiterated the application of the RD 661/2007 economic regime for existing installations.
This did not represent a change in Spain's circumstances that could somehow support a
reasonable correlation between addressing the tariff deficit and the complete withdrawal

of the RD 661/2007 economic regime.

441. Therefore, according to the Claimants, there is no reasonable correlation between

addressing the tariff deficit and implementing the Disputed Measures.**?

442. Finally, in its analysis of the FET standard, Spain contends that Article 10(1) of the ECT
prohibits Spain from impairing investments by “unreasonable or discriminatory
measures.” According to the Claimants, demonstrating that Spain's adverse measures
are either unreasonable or discriminatory suffices to establish a breach of Article 10(1)
of the ECT. However, the Claimants note that a breach of this obligation results

simultaneously in a breach of the FET standard.

In this context, the Claimants refer to the Saluka case which describes the standard of
“reasonableness,” requiring that the “State's conduct bear a reasonable relationship to
some rational policy.” Accordingly, for the Claimants, Spain must show that its
measures were (i) taken in pursuance of a rational policy goal, and (ii) were carefully
tailored to achieve that goal.**! The Claimants contend that, contrary to Spain’s
arguments, the tariff deficit is “the product of Spain’s regulatory failures and, therefore,
is not a policy goal.” As a result, the Claimants conclude that the Disputed Measures,
in addition to constituting a breach of the FET, have also “impaired” the Claimants’

investment in breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT.*?

The Claimants allege that in order to assess whether a State measure is proportionate or
not, there must be a reasonable relationship between the burden imposed on the foreign
investor and the aim sought to be realised by the State measure.*** This test is not

satisfied in the present case.

First, the stated objective of Spain’s measures has been to address the issue of the tariff
deficit. The Claimants refers that the regulatory measures aimed at curtailing the FIT
for wind cannot be considered “suitable” measures to achieve the intended purpose since

the remuneration to wind farms was not the source of the tariff deficit.***

Secondly, a State measure is not proportionate unless it is necessary to achieve the goals
pursued. The Claimants affirm that this analysis implies an assessment as to whether
there are other less intrusive means with regard to the rights affected that are equally
able to achieve the stated goal. The Claimants sustain that Spain’s own organs
contemporaneously identified alternative solutions less harmful to investors, such as a

tax on all CO2 emissions. Therefore, according to the Claimants, on the basis that Spain

had alternative solutions to tackle the problem of the tariff deficit, less harmful to

investors, Spain’s measures cannot be considered to be proportionate.**>

447, The Claimants also allege that Spain has violated Article 10(1) of the ECT which
prohibits Spain from impairing investments by “unreasonable or discriminatory

measures.”*°©

448. The Claimants sustain that whether a measure falls foul of the non-impairment clause
requires considering whether an unreasonable or discriminatory measure has impaired
the investment in question. According to the Claimants, the test for unreasonableness

in this context is the same as the test within the confines of the FET standard.>*”

449. The Claimants state, as explained above, that the measures were not taken by Spain in
pursuance of a rational goal or tailored to achieve that goal. As a result, the tariff deficit
cannot constitute a reasonable policy goal for the Disputed Measures. According to the
Claimants, it cannot be disputed that those measures have “impaired” the Claimants’
investment. In the Claimants’ view, Spain's actions have caused damages to Claimants’
investment in the amount of EUR 119.6 million. Therefore, in addition to a violation of
the FET standard under the ECT, Spain's actions violate the obligation under Article
10(1) of the ECT to refrain from impairing the Claimants’ investment through

unreasonable measures.

450. The Claimants reject Spain’s application of the test set out in EDF v. Romania and its
suggestions that: (a) the purpose of the Disputed Measures was legitimate; (b) the
Disputed Measures complied with Spanish law; (c) the Disputed Measures were not
taken for an ulterior reason (but were to address the tariff deficit); and (d) the Disputed

Measures were implemented in a manner that respected due process and procedure. ***

2. Respondent’s Position

Spain contends that pursuant to “fests” established under EDF v. Romania, AES v.
Hungary and Total v. Argentina, Spain’s measures are not discriminatory, abusive or
disproportionate.**? Importantly, contrary to the Claimants’ position, Spain underscores
that “there was a rational policy to adopt macroeconomic control measures.” In Spain’s
view, the tariff deficit, but also the economic crisis, presented important challenges in
light of which the measures that Spain undertook shall not be deemed as irrational. In
this respect, Spain also invokes that the subsidies for the production of RE must comply

with EU rules on State aids.*°

Spain also states that the Disputed Measures were proportionate and reasonable since

they provide the Claimants with reasonable return.**!

The Respondent observes that the Claimants state that the measures contested are not
reasonable because the reasons (excess capacity and the tariff deficit) are attributable to

Spain.

The Respondent points out to certain facts that, according to its position, are not
attributable to the Kingdom of Spain, such as (1) the principal of sustainability of the
SES; (2) the worsening of the international crisis between 2007 and 2012; (3) the
exceptional fall in electricity demand; and (4) the international commitments assumed
through the memorandum of understanding with the EU in July 2012 to bail out Spain’s
financial sector.

The Respondent affirms that the conclusions of the award in BG v. Argentina are not
applicable to this case, since in this case there is no commitment to maintain the tariffs

for a certain amount of time.*4?

459.

The Respondent mentions that the Claimants declare that the measures are
disproportionate (1) by attacking the tariff deficit through removing the regime of RD
661/2007, when the wind and hydraulic sector tariffs played a limited role in the tariff
deficit, and (2) as there are other alternatives such as increasing the bill to consumers or

establishing taxes to fund the deficit.

The Respondent stresses that the Claimants omit to say that the measures were applied
to the entire system, including consumers, to re-balance the SES. The Respondent
asserts that the measures not only affected the RE Sector, because these are not an island
within the SES, but rather affected all activities that involve a cost for the SES. In
addition, Spain clarifies that within the renewable sector, the measures affected all
technologies. The Respondent stress that it is as a whole that the proportional nature of
the measures should be understood, not in one specific sector as the Claimants are

attempting to do.*

Furthermore, the Respondent states that the Claimants have not substantiated the legal,
economic and budgetary validity of the alternatives they propose to re-balance the SES
and guarantee their future sustainability. Moreover, the Respondent states that, this
reveals ignorance (1) of the public deficit obligations assumed by Spain through the
memorandum of understanding signed with the EU and (2) of the Spanish tax and

budgetary regulations.

The Respondent points out four facts that led to the changes in the SES: (1) the existence
of an international economic crisis that led to a reduction in electricity demand; (2) the
rise in consumer tariffs, (3) the existence of excess remuneration in the RE Sector, and
(4) the existence of expectations of growth of the tariff deficit. According to the
Respondent, all of the mentioned circumstances implied the economic unsustainability

of the SES.*4

462.

The Respondent further establishes that the RE Association, APPA, with the legal
support of Cuatrecasas, Goncalves Pereira, proposed that the remuneration of renewable
energies should be determined in 2009 in a similar way to that established in 2013 by
RDL 9/2013. The relevance of this proposal is obvious, because it proves the fact that
the remuneration system laid down in 2013 does not violate the FET standard of the
ECT. In other words, these 2013 remuneration measures are reasonable and
proportionate if the majority APPA Association proposed a similar system as the best
one (1) for achieving reasonable return rates with reference to the cost of money in the
capital market, (2) provide “security and stability for investments” and (3) allow “the

RE to develop their potential in a sustainable and lasting manner.”>**

In the Respondent’s view, the current regulatory regime attracted over 5 billion euros in
investment in RE in Spain in 2015. This is due to the stability and security of the current
system in terms of the receipt of income. However, the Respondent states that the
Claimants omitted these facts before the Tribunal, giving a partial and incomplete view
of the reform of the disputed regulatory framework. The Claimants omitted the so-called

“renewable energy boom” in the year 2015.°4°

The Respondent further alleges that the Claimants also omit any reference to the positive
assessments that the measures received from the European Commission, the
International Monetary Fund and the International Energy Agency in the years 2015 and
2016. The financial reality after the challenged measures and the assessments of
international bodies show the proportionality and reasonability of the measures adopted
and undermine the statements of the Claimants regarding the sector following the
adoption of the measures. The mass entry of new investors would only be logical if the
new regulation guaranteed reasonable returns. Furthermore, only if the measures are
reasonable, proportionate and effective will they merit the positive appraisal of

international bodies.*4”

463. According to the Respondent, the main objective of the ECT is non-discrimination in
relation to foreign investors. Furthermore, article 10(1) ECT establishes a FET standard
and additionally, in relation to the obligation to give investments already made “no less
favorable treatment than that required by international law’, it recognises the minimum

standard of protection guaranteed by International Law.**

464. In the Respondent’s view, there are different tests that are applied by the international
arbitral Tribunals, which make it possible to assess whether the measures adopted by a

State are irrational or discriminatory pursuant to the ECT objectives and standards:

a. The EDF v. Rumania test*, which makes it possible to examine whether Spain
has respected the main objective of the ECT, adopting non-discriminatory
measures in respect of the Claimants; and

b. The AES Summit v. Hungary test*°, accepted by the Claimants as relevant,
allowing the question of whether or not the Kingdom of Spain respected the
FET standard of Article 10(1) of the ECT; and

1

c. The Total v. Argentina®' case test, to assess the respecting of the financial

balance of the investment.

465. In the EDF v. Romania case, the tribunal made use of the verification criteria listed by
Dr. Christoph Schreuer in order to assess whether or not the measures adopted by a State
are discriminatory. In this respect, Dr. Schreuer considers a measure to be
discriminatory when: “(a) A measure that inflicts damage on the investor without
serving any apparent legitimate purpose; (b) A measure that is not based on legal

standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference; (c) A measure taken for

reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker; (d) A measure

taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure.”**?

466. According to the Respondent, the purpose of the reform is completely legitimate. The
measures attempt to address a situation of unsustainable imbalance, in which the
international and national economic circumstances determined a reduction in demand

which made it necessary to re-balance the system.*>*

467. In the Respondent’s view, the reform carried out was implemented in full compliance
with the existing legal regulations and the case law of the Spanish Supreme Court,
guaranteeing the reasonable return that was and is required by the Electricity Sector
Law. In addition, Spain asserts that the reform being challenged has a general scope. In
other words, for the Respondent, the reform is applicable to all operators and to all
sectors intervening in the energy market. Therefore, it is not discriminatory with respect

to any investor, either national or international.>>4

468. The Respondent says that in the present case, the Preamble of RDL 6/2009 and RDL
14/2010, as well as the main of RD 1614/2010, warned about the need to reform the
electricity sector in order to guarantee its sustainability. These reasons are the same as

those on which the measures being challenged were based.**

469. Finally, Spain alleges that the Spanish government has followed the legally established

procedures to enact the regulatory standard of remuneration in the electricity sector.**°

470. According to the Respondent, the test set out in the AES Summit case is used to
determine whether or not an unreasonable or disproportionate measure exists that does

not comply with the FET standard laid down by the ECT.°*’

471. The Respondent states that according to AES Summit, there are two elements that require
to be analysed to determine whether a state’s act was unreasonable: the existence of a

rational policy and the reasonableness of the act of the State in relation to the policy.

472. The Respondent reiterates that the system providing support for renewables is based on
the legal principle of reasonable returns in the context of a sustainable SES. The
regulator acted with the purpose of restoring the balance required by the applicable
legislation. This imbalance, as well as involving an excessive burden for Spanish
consumers, was decisively contributing to the generation of the so-called tariff deficit,
the correction of which was required by law. In addition, the imbalance in favour of the
producers that the regulator was trying to stem was taking place in a scenario of acute

economic crisis, both in the SES in particular and in the Spanish economy as a whole.***

473. The Respondent further affirms that the criterion of AES Summit has been subsequently

ratified by the Electrabel and Charanne cases.>°°

474. The Respondent concludes that its actions were in line with the first of the parameters
considered in the AES Summit v. Hungary case: the policy carried out by the Kingdom
of Spain was valid and fulfilled the objective of a public economic policy. This is the
correction and prevention, in order to protect consumers, of the payment to investors of
a higher remuneration than what is reasonable. According to the Respondent, the

relevance and rationality of the measure is, in conclusion, beyond all doubt.

137

475. Regarding the second criterion, the Respondent affirms that the reform meets this
requirement of reasonableness. The reform adopted by the Government affected all
subjects involved in the SES. The said reform distributed the measures to increase the
income and reduce the costs of the SES between the consumers and all the operators in
the system (producers, distributors and transport companies) with the goal of dealing

with the tariff deficit.>°

476. The Respondent further states that as well as reasonable, the measures adopted are also
proportionate. The system of subsidies that enabled producers to achieve reasonable
returns of around 7.398%, which could be higher in the case of surpassing the standards
established on a standard facility, was maintained, at the same time as correcting and
avoiding situations of imbalance, which prejudiced Spanish consumers and contributed

to endangering the financial sustainability of the SES.**!

477. According to the Respondent, the tribunal in the Total case established as a minimum
FET standard for these kinds of investments the consideration of whether or not the
principle of economic balance that would allow long-term investors to recoup the costs

and obtain a reasonable return on their investment had been respected.*

478. The Respondent states that the reform carried out following the investment made by the
Claimants, fulfils the said requirements. The remunerative parameters have been
calculated to permit the reimbursement of both the operational costs as well as the initial
investment.°©

479. The Respondent concludes that through the challenged measures, Spain guarantees the
remuneration and repayment required by the tribunal in the Total v. Argentina case as a
minimum standard required to consider the FET minimum standard as not violated by

modifications occurring in the general regulatory framework for long-term investments

of large amounts of capital. Therefore, the Respondent is not violating the FET

minimum standard established in the scope of international law, applicable to this case

together with the ECT.

G. Tribunal’s Analysis

480. This analysis represents the majority view of the Tribunal and reference to the word

“Tribunal” in the analysis is the majority view.

481. The principal issue is whether Spain has violated Article 10(1) of the ECT, namely, the

obligation pursuant to Article 10(1) which reads as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this
Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
condition for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in
its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times
to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable
treatment. Such investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection
and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance,
use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded
treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including
treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it
has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any
other Contracting Party.>*

482. Article 10(1) of the ECT has, in the Tribunal’s view, the following obligations:

qd) to “encourage and create suitable, equitable, favourable and transparent

conditions for the investors’;

(2) to accord “at all times, to investments of investors of other contracting

parties fair and equitable treatment’;
(3) to provide investments “the most constant protection and security”;

(4) not to impair investments by unreasonable or discriminatory measures;

564 Energy Charter Treaty, Art. 10(1), Exhibit C-1.

139

(5) to accord investments, treatment that is not [....less favourable. ...] than that
required by international law including treaty obligations;

(6) that each Contracting Party “shall observe any obligations it has entered
into with an investor of an investment of an investor of any other

Contracting Party.”

483. The primary claim of the Claimants is that the Respondent failed to provide fair and
equitable treatment by failing to protect the Claimants’ legitimate expectations. The
protection of legitimate expectations is an essential element in the Tribunal’s view, of
the provisions of fair and equitable treatment pursuant to the provisions of Article 10(1)

of the ECT.

484. This necessitates the consideration by the Tribunal as to whether Spain, in respect of the
Claimants’ investments, accorded “fair and equitable treatment” and “stable, equitable,

favourable and transparent conditions” to the Claimants.

485. The secondary issue is whether Spain is in breach of the Umbrella Clause.

1. Applicable Law

486. Article 26(6) of the ECT provides that the Tribunal shall “decide the issues in dispute
in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international
law”. The Tribunal will apply customary international law and general principles of
international law to this arbitration where the ECT, which is the primary source of law,

is silent. Spain does not dispute the applicability of the said Article.*®

487. The ECT being an international treaty, has to be interpreted pursuant to the provisions

of Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT*® and the provisions read as follows:

565 Respondent's Rejoinder, { 880.

56 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1155 United Nations Treaty Series 331, 23 May 1969 (entry into force 27 January

Article 31: General rule of interpretation

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the
light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise,
in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes: (a) any
agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in
connection with the conclusion of the treaty; (b) any instrument which was
made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty
and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which
establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations
between the parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties
so intended.

Article 32: Supplementary means of interpretation

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including
the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion,
in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31,
or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:

(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

488. Article 31 of the VCLT requires the ECT to be interpreted in good faith in accordance
with the ordinary meaning of its terms in accordance with the object and purpose of the
ECT as set out in Article 2 of the ECT which reads as follows:
... [establish] a legal framework in order to promote long-term co-operation
in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits, in

accordance with the objectives and principles of the [European Energy]
Charter.*°”

placing “the commitments contained in that Charter [i.e. the 1991 European Energy Charter] on a secure and binding international

141

489. The Tribunal is of the view that the applicable law is the ECT and any rules of
international law which are relevant with regard to interpretation and application. The
Tribunal will only refer to the provisions of Spanish law and EU law if, in the Tribunal’s

view, it is appropriate.

2. Applicability of EU Law

490. The RREEF Decision in its jurisdictional decision, rejected Spain’s jurisdictional
objection and the decision also, when considering the merits, found that if there was
incompatibility or discrepancy between the ECT and the EU law, then ECT must

prevail.

3. Fair and Equitable Treatment

491. The Tribunal will deal initially with the issue of whether Spain accorded to the

Claimants’ investment, fair and equitable treatment.

492. The Tribunal has to consider whether the measures taken by Spain to its electricity
regime which include, but are not limited to, Law 15/2012, RDL 2/2013, RDL 9/2013,
Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014 and the June 2014 Order, constitute a breach and violation
of Article 10(1) of the ECT, taking into account that the Claimants have invested
approximately EUR 91 million into the Spanish RE electricity sector®®*. The Tribunal
has to consider whether these measures adopted by Spain have fundamentally and
radically altered the applicable legal and regulatory framework which the Claimants

relied upon when they made their investment.

493. Article 10(1) of the ECT places an obligation on the part of Spain to provide “a
commitment to accord at all times to investments of investors of other contracting

parties fair and equitable treatment.” The issue is whether the disputed measures

legal basis; (ii) [catalyzing] economic growth by means of measures to liberalise investment and trade in energy; and (iii) attaching
“the utmost importance to the effective implementation of full national treatment and most favoured nation treatment”.

enacted by Spain are in breach of the fair and equitable treatment that should be
accorded to the Claimants, especially when they argue that they relied on the legislation

does not contend that its right to regulate, stems from the FET standard and the
“balancing exercise” to which the Electrabel tribunal refers. It is the finding of the
Tribunal that Spain does not explain the basis for its so-called rights to regulate in the
context of Article 10(1) of the ECT and it also does not demonstrate in what way that is
consistent with the exceptions which are set out in Article 24 of the ECT. The Tribunal
therefore finds that Spain’s reliance on the decision in Electrabel, is of no assistance.

Total decision, applied the minimum standard of protection required by the FET, which
would allow a State to modify its legal framework, provided that the investor is still able
to recover its operating costs, amortise its investment and make a “reasonable return”
over a said period of time. The Tribunal is of the view that the decision in Total does
not assist Spain’s arguments as it was not a decision pursuant to the ECT but pursuant
to the 1991 France-Argentina BIT, which does not contain stability provisions for
investors.°*! The Tribunal notes that the tribunal in the Total decision, considered the
FET standard in the following terms “cannot be read as ‘treatment required by the
minimum standard of treatment of aliens/investors under international law’””.**? The
Tribunal also notes that the quotations that it relies upon in Total were made when that

tribunal was weighing the investors’ legitimate expectations on the one hand and the

France and Argentina does not contain any such reference, following the French BIT model. This absence indicates, at a minimum,
that stability of the legal domestic framework was not envisaged as a specific element of the domestic legal regime that the
Contracting Parties undertook to grant to their respective investors”.

respondent State’s legitimate regulatory interests on the other hand, in the absence of
any specific stability commitment. The tribunal in Total also found that the concept of
“regulatory fairness” or “regulatory certainty” intervenes to ensure that the investors
recover their operation costs and make a “reasonable return”.°*? The Tribunal is of the
view that, having considered the decision in Total, the facts are clearly different, the
principles are different and hence it does not support Spain’s contention that it may
radically change the remuneration regime which the Claimants had relied upon, when

making their investment in reliance of the express commitments made by Spain.

The Tribunal has to consider in the light of the rival contentions of the Claimants and
the Respondent and the terms of the ECT, whether the changes to the Spanish legislation

provides a “reasonable return” and how is “reasonable return” determined.

Spain’s principal contention in respect of the decision is that there was a commitment
by Spain to investors that there was a guarantee to provide reasonable return. This
finding of the RREEF Decision is not supported by a number of awards which have
found that Spain did promise investors that it would not alter retroactively the specific

tariffs of RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010.5*

The RREEF Decision took the view that Spain’s regulatory regime was sufficient to
create legitimate expectations but contrary to the decisions in Eiser, Novenergia, Antin
and Masdar, the RREEF Decision found that neither Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 or
Articles 4 and 5 of RD 1614/2010 protected investors against tariff changes. The

decision went on to hold that the guarantee of reasonable return was the specific

commitment of Spain’s regulatory regime.**° The Tribunal prefers the persuasive views

set out in the decisions of Eiser, Novenergia, Antin and Masdar.

501. In any event, the RREEF tribunal found that the disputed measures lowered the return
on the Claimants’ CSP investments below the threshold of a reasonable return and it
further concluded that it had radically altered the regulatory regime in respect of which

the Claimants made their investment.**°

502. The RREEF Decision found that reasonable return is dynamic in that it was not fixed
and could evolve depending on the cost of money in the capital market. The Tribunal
is of the view that this conclusion is inconsistent with the evidence that was before the
RREFF tribunal especially as the cost of money in the capital markets was substantially
the same in 2007 when the RD 661/2007 regime was implemented and in 2013 when
the new regime was implemented. In any event, the dissent of Prof. Volterra is relevant

in that he criticised this aspect of the RREEF Decision.>*’

503. The Claimants in this case have put forward extensive evidence of contemporaneous
documents showing that Spain offered investors a fixed guaranteed return and not just
areasonable return. The Tribunal has considered the contemporaneous evidence and it
is not persuaded that the evidence adduced by the Respondent is sufficient for
determining a “reasonable return” and neither is it in fulfilment of the representations
made by the Respondent with regard to the stability of the legal and economic regime
that would be applicable to RE projects in order to entice investments into the wind
sector. The Tribunal concludes that the Respondent’s methodology for determining
reasonable rate of return in the light of the amendments to the legislation is, in the

Tribunal’s view, not based on any identifiable criteria. The Tribunal is therefore of the

view that the RREEF Decision does not in any way, assist the Respondent in its primary
contention that the Claimants were only entitled to a reasonable return on their
investments and that in the Tribunal’s view, is a very narrow and erroneous

interpretation of the RREEF Decision.

504. The Tribunal has considered the arguments of the Claimants and the Respondent in
respect of the RREEF Decision with regard to reasonable return and is of the view that
the RREEF Decision does not, in any way, assist the Respondent in its contention that
the Claimants were only entitled to a reasonable return on their investments and the
Tribunal is of the view that the argument advanced by Spain is a very narrow and
erroneous interpretation of the RREEF Decision, especially with regard to the issue of

reasonable return.

505. Spain makes numerous references to Spanish law in order to suggest that the Tribunal
should assess the existence and scope of Spain’s commitments and obligations towards

8

the Claimants or their investment through the lens of Spanish law.*** Spanish law

should not be used as a tool to override Spain’s international obligations.

506. In Spain’s view, the Claimants’ interpretation of the RD 661/2007 economic regime
amounts to a claim that the regime would be frozen, thereby precluding Spain’s ability

to regulate.

507. The Eiser tribunal held as follows:

[a]bsent explicit undertakings directly extended to investors and
guaranteeing that States will not change their laws or regulations,
investment treaties do not eliminate States’ right to modify their regulatory
regimes to meet evolving circumstances and public needs.>*?

the evidence shows that Respondent eliminated a favourable regulatory
regime previously extended to Claimants and other investors to encourage
their investment in CSP. It was then replaced with an unprecedented and
wholly different regulatory approach, based on wholly different premises.
This new system was profoundly unfair and inequitable as applied to
Claimants’ existing investment.>”°

509. The Tribunal finds that Spain is not entitled, pursuant to the provisions of Article 10(1)
ECT, to deprive the Claimants of the economic rights associated with the RD 661/2007
regime when it freely undertook to grant those rights and guarantee their continuity over

the entire operational life of the installations.

510. Spain contends, relying on the decision in AES v. Hungary and also on Mamidoil v.
Albania, that “the stable conditions referred to by the ECT clearly allow the adoption
of reasonable and proportionate macroeconomic control measures” and that the
reference in the ECT to those stable conditions, does not mean that the ECT contains a

stabilisation clause.°?!

511. The Tribunal refers to the decision of the ICSID tribunal in Liman Caspian Oil v.

Kazakhstan which reads as follows:

...[T]he purpose of ECT Article 10(1), second sentence, is to provide a
protection which goes beyond the minimum standard to treatment under
international law. The ECT was intended to go further than simply
reiterating the protection offered by the latter. In this respect, ECT Article
10(1), second sentence, differs from NAFTA Article 1105 (in its
interpretation given by the Free Trade Commission on 31 July 2001) which
contains an express reference to international law. Therefore, when
assessing Respondent’s actions, a specific standard of fairness and
equitableness above the minimum standard must be identified and applied
for the application of the ECT. °°?

512. The FET standard in the ECT has a specific legal meaning for the reasons set out in
Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT and it includes reference to the ordinary meaning of the
words ‘fair’, which is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as “just, unbiased, equitable,

impartial, legitimate and the word “equitable” means “characterised by equity or

fairness”, with “equity” being defined as “fairness; impartiality; even-handed

dealing” .°**

513. The Tribunal has to interpret the concept of FET autonomously taking into account its

text according to its ordinary meaning, international law and good faith.°®°

514. The Tribunal will address the following considerations to determine if Spain is in breach

of the FET standard, namely, whether Spain[’s]:

. breached the Claimants’ reasonable and legitimate expectations when they
made their investments;
. failed to provide a stable and predictable legal and business framework in

relation to the Claimants’ investment;

. conduct was transparent;

4. Legitimate Expectation

The Tribunal will now consider whether Spain breached the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations, when they made their investment and thereby was in breach of the FET

standard.

The Tribunal finds that there is no burden on the part of the Claimants to prove bad faith
or any ulterior motive on the part of Spain in enacting the various measures in order to
determine whether the measures taken by Spain constitute a violation of FET standards.
However, the Tribunal is of the view that the burden of proving breach of the FET
standard in the ECT is on the Claimants. The Tribunal relies on the decision in

Electrabel, which stated as follows:

The Tribunal starts with the premise that it is Electrabel which bears the
burden of proving its case under the ECT’s FET standard.*””

The expectations of the Claimants have to be based on the facts in this arbitration and it
must be viewed objectively.°°? The Claimants’ expectation must be assessed at the time
the investment was made and the Claimants’ investment must originate from some
affirmative action of Spain in the form of specific commitments made by Spain to the

investor, or by representations made by Spain, which encouraged the investment.

The principles of international investment law indicate that the host State should not
“affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to
make the investment.”*°? The FET standard requires the host State to protect the
investors’ legitimate expectation based on “any undertakings and representations made

explicitly or implicitly by the host State”°.

519. The Tribunal having considered the Claimants and the Respondent’s comments on the
RREEF Decision, notes that the decision found that Spain had implemented a favourable
legal framework to attract investment,! that Spain had created legitimate expectations
that the Claimants could rely upon, that Spain would not significantly modify the legal
framework.® The decision also found that Spain breached Article 10.1 of the ECT by

implementing disputed measures.

520. The RREEF Decision in the Tribunal’s view, also agreed with the decision in Eiser in
two aspects, namely that there was an obligation under the ECT to accord fair and
equitable treatment and that embraces an obligation to provide stability so that it is relied
upon by the investor in making long term investments and secondly, the RREEF tribunal
agreed that the ECT prevented Spain from radically altering the regulatory regime to
existing investments, whereby investors in reliance of the legislative regime, are

deprived of their investment value.°°

521. The Tribunal notes that Spain is entitled to make amendments to its regulatory regime
but after having entered into the ECT, there are limitation on its powers to alter the
regulatory framework and it should not do so if such fundamental and radical changes
would be unfair, unreasonable and inequitable, which would undermine an investor’s

legitimate expectation,

522. An important element of legitimate expectation is the protection from State action that
threatens the stability of the legal and business framework upon which an investor

reasonably relied on, in making its investment and this concept has been endorsed by a

number of tribunals.

523. The Tribunal has to ascertain what were the Claimants’ expectations, which gave rise

to their claim of legitimate expectation. The Claimants contend it is two-fold:

(a) the nature, amount and duration of the FIT offered under RD 661/2007 and
RD 1614/2010; and
(b) with regard to the stability of the RD 661/2007 economic regime.

524. The Claimants in support of the nature, amount and duration of the FIT offered under
RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010, contend that once the installations were registered
with RAIPRE, that the following would be applicable:

(a) the Project companies would have a choice between selling electricity at a

Fixed Tariff or at the Premium, as set out in Article 36 of RD 661/2007;

5 CMS Gas Transmission Company v The Argentine Republic, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/O1/8, 12 May 2005, 275, Exhibit
CL-38. In this case, the State had provided certain guarantees for tariffs of natural gas, including in legislation, regulations and
under the terms of a licence. These tariff guarantees were first suspended by emergency legislation and later terminated by a series
of further enactments. The tribunal found that “[t]te measures that are complained of did in fact entirely transform and alter the
legal and business environment under which the investment was made” and thus resulted in an “objective breach” of the FET
standard (see ff. 266-275 and 281); Occidental Exploration and Production Co. v Republic of Ecuador, Award, UNCITRAL Case

(b) the FIT would apply to all of the electricity produced, without any
limitations on production;

(c) the FIT would apply for the entire operational life of the installations; and

(d) the FIT would be subject to inflation adjustments, as provided in RD
661/2007.°°

525. The Claimants’ expectation was that any future changes to RD 661/2007 would be

prospective.

526. The Tribunal is of the view that Spain had promised explicitly that the economic regime
for the qualifying Special Regime installation would remain stable under RD 661/2007
which contained the stabilisation commitment in Article 44(3)®” and reiterated in RD
1614/2010 that any revisions to the fixed tariff and premium pursuant to Article 44(3)

of RD 661/2007, would not affect duly registered existing installations. °°

527. The Tribunal finds that the Claimants’ expectations on the continued application of the
economic regime to the Project Companies were legitimate and reasonable, for the

following reasons:

(a) RD 661/2007 FIT which the Claimants relied on, provided very specific
tariffs that would apply to the Project Companies; Article 36 specified the
fixed tariff and premium that the Claimants would receive for 20 years and

more;

6 Claimants’ Memorial, J 418.

7 RD 61/2007 of 25 May 2007, Article 44(3), Exhibit C-44. Article 44(3) provided for the possibility to review the Fixed Tariff
and Premiums (and the floor and cap in the latter case) in consideration of the evolution of the cost of the technology and its
coverage in the renewable sector. However, Article 44(3) expressly stated that those revisions would not affect the Fixed Tariff,
nor the floor and cap of the Premium option, for existing installations commissioned prior to 1 January of the second year following
the year in which the revision was implemented (for instance, if a review was conducted in 2010, it would not affect installations
that had obtained a commissioning certificate prior to 1 January 2012). Thus, RD 661/2007 guaranteed that any review of the
Fixed Tariff would not apply to existing installations and that in the case of the Premium option, although the amount of the
Premium could change, the minimum revenue would not change as any modification of the cap and floor would not apply to
existing installations.

(b) there was a commitment in Article 44(3) that the fixed tariff for the upper
and lower thresholds of the premium option for existing installation would
not be changed, as reiterated in RD 1614/2010, which included the premium

within the scope of protection;

(c) the CNE represented as follows:

offer[ed] security and predictability for economic incentives during
the lifespan of the facilities, establishing transparent mechanisms for
the annual updates of said incentives and [pursuant to Article 44(3)]
exempt[ed] existing facilities from revision every four years because
the new incentives that are being put into place only affect new
facilities.

(d) the economic regime of RD 661/2007 was part of a wider
international and domestic policy to develop RE power generation
infrastructure and to specifically encourage and attract the necessary

investments; and

(e) the purpose of RD 661/2007 was to attract the necessary investment in RE
projects such as wind farms and without these incentives and support
schemes, the Claimants would have to compete with conventional
generators and in view of the capital investment, such investments would

not have been attractive.

528. The Tribunal is of the view that Spain made this commitment to attract investments by
offering stability when Spain had no obligation to do so. The Claimants through their
witness Felipe Moreno, have indicated that without the above representation, the

Claimants would not have invested in the Spanish RE sector.°!°

530.

The Tribunal finds that Spain by enacting RD 1614/2010 which applied to qualifying
wind installations confirm that they would not be affected by any review of the FIT
under RD 661/2007. This was consistent with the commitments of Spain pursuant to
Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 and furthermore, RD 1614/2010 also broadened the scope

of protection under Article 44(3) to include premiums.

The Tribunal has to consider whether the July 2010 Agreement and RD 1614/2010
amounts to a commitment by Spain. Spain is of the view that the 2010 Agreement has
no bearing on the interpretation of RD 1614/2010 and that the AEE*!' did not consider
RD 1614/2010 as providing a stable regime for the existing installations.°!? The
Tribunal having considered the rival arguments on this issue, is of the view that the 2010
Agreement according to the Government Press Release, “assume[d] the reinforcement
of the visibility and stability of the regulation of [CSD] technologies in the future,
guaranteeing the current subsidies and rates of RD 661/2007 for the facilities in
operation (and for those included in the pre-registration) starting in 2013” °'.
Furthermore, Spain has relied on the comment of AEE, entitled “safeguard against
future revisions of the remuneration regime” and proposed modified wording for RD
1614/2010 as the AEE considered it “unacceptable” that the draft sought to restrict that
article 44.3 “safeguard” to installations with commissioning certificates of a particular
date. Furthermore, the AEE expressed its understanding of RD 1614/2010 in its
presentation dated 13 December 2010 as follows:

For ... installations registered under RD 661/2007, the revisions of the
tariffs, premiums and upper and lower limits to which article 44.3 of RD
661/2007 WILL NOT AFFECT said installations.°!4

The Tribunal therefore holds that the July 2010 Agreement which is a contemporaneous
document of Spain, amounts to a representation to the Claimants especially in view of

the fact that Spain referred to the July 2010 Agreement in the following terms:

This agreement furthermore assumes the reinforcement of the visibility and
stability of the regulation of these technologies in the future, guaranteeing
the current incentives and rates of RD 661/2007 for the facilities in
operation. (and for those included in the pre-registration) starting in
2013...

Spain made various representations which included the promotion of advertising
materials such as the English Language documents, presentation in foreign countries
designed to attract foreign investment for the RE projects. The Tribunal finds that the

Claimants are entitled to rely on these expectations which were reasonable.

5. Did Spain’s measures frustrate the Claimants’ reasonable and legitimate

expectations?

Spain sought investments on the basis of specific representations and undertakings to
induce the Claimants to make significant investments in wind farms and the issue that
arises is whether after the Claimants having made these investments, Spain took

measures to frustrate the Claimants’ reasonable and legitimate expectations.

Fair and equitable treatment requires that the treatment of Spain in respect of the
Claimants’ investment should be over a long period and not be an isolated one. The
Tribunal is of the view that the facts will indicate that Spain has since December 2012,
taken a number of measures which have frustrated the Claimants’ legitimate

expectations and these measures by Spain are set out below:

(a) Introduction of the 7% levy pursuant to Law 15/2012, would appear to be contrary
to the Claimants’ expectations of the level of FIT they would be entitled to under

RD 661/2007;

(b) Elimination of the Premium pursuant to RDL 2/2013, frustrates the expectations
the Claimants had under RD 661/2007 to choose between selling at a FIT or at
the market prices plus Premium. RDL 2/2013 also replaced the CPI-linked
updating mechanism for the RD 661/2007 FIT on which the Claimants relied with

an entirely different mechanism; and

(c) Wiping out the RD 661/2007 economic regime in its entirety in July 2013
pursuant to RDL 9/2013 and introducing an entirely differently regime that is less

favourable to the Claimants.

535. Law 15/2012 was enacted after the Claimants had made their investment and hence it
cannot be considered that it is irrelevant in order to assess whether the Claimants had a
reasonable expectation at the time of their investment that the Law 15/2012 would be
enacted. However, as the Tribunal has found that it does not have jurisdiction over Law
15/2012, the Tribunal will accordingly, not consider it when making its assessment as

to whether the Claimants had a legitimate expectation.

536. The Tribunal relies on the decision in Micula v. Romania®'® where the majority of the
Tribunal held that Romania had breached the FET standard in the applicable Sweden-
Romania BIT through premature revocation of economic support schemes created by
legislation regarding investments made in some of the countries’ deprived regions. The
decision states that Romania made specific promises to the investor in respect of the
support schemes and there was also an element of inducement on the part of Romania.

The relevant passage of the Micula tribunal is relevant, and is set out below:

616 Joan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v The Republic of Romania, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, 11 December 2013,
Exhibit CL-88.

157

[I]t cannot be fair and equitable for a state to offer advantages to investors
with the purpose of attracting investment in an otherwise unattractive
region, require these investors to maintain their investments in that region
for twice the period they receive the incentives, and then maintain the
formal shell of the regime but eviscerate it of all (or substantially all)
content.°!”

537. The Tribunal holds that in the present instance, Article 36 of RD 661/2007 provided that
the FIT would be available for a specified period for kWh electricity produced for the
first 20 years, of a wind installation life and thereafter for a different lower amount for
each kWh produced in subsequent years. RD 661/2007, pursuant to Article 44(3),
provided a guarantee namely that once the installations were registered and in operation,
any reviews of FIT would only affect future wind installations. This was confirmed by

RD 1614/2010.

538. The conduct of Spain indicates that after it enacted RD 661/2007, it reneged on these
undertakings and this amounts to a frustration of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.
The Tribunal is therefore of the view that Spain has failed to accord fair and equitable

treatment to the Claimants pursuant to Article 10(1) of the ECT.
(a) Did Spain provide a suitable and predictable regime?

539, The next question that arises is whether Spain provided a stable and predictable

regulatory regime. The first sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT reads as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this

Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments

in its Area. (emphasis added)

540. The 1991 Charter which forms part of the ECT states that one of its fundamental

objectives is the establishment of a “stable, transparent legal framework for foreign

°17 Joan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v The Republic of Romania, \CSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, 11 December 2013, J]

2618

investment’ and this is narrated in the provisions of the ECT. Spain was therefore

under an obligation to provide long term stability.

541. Article 10(1) of the ECT obligates Spain “to encourage and create stable, equitable,
favourable and transparent conditions” for investors. This is important in the RE
electricity sector as the Claimants have committed a substantial amount of capital when
investing in Wind Farms so that a long-term return is generated and realised. The ECT
is distinct from BITs because the ECT is specific to the energy sector and also because

the BITs do not contain the express obligations that are enshrined in Article 10(1).

542. Spain contends that the ECT is primarily concerned with non-discrimination and
national treatment and the ECT’s objective was not to guarantee “petrification’”®'”? of
the regulatory regime and hence, there can be no breach of the ECT if Spain adopts
“macroeconomic control measures on the grounds of general interest.”°° Spain also
contends, relying on the decision in Jsolux and Plama, that Article 10(1) of the ECT
does not contain an autonomous standard to create stable conditions for investment.‘
The Tribunal is of the view that that cannot be a basis for the enactment of the Disputed

Measures.

543. The Tribunal recognises that the obligation to accord “stable” and “transparent”
conditions does not mean that Spain must freeze or alternatively not amend its electricity
laws. The Tribunal is of the view that Spain having entered voluntarily into the ECT,
must accept that there are limitations with regard to the amendment of its regulatory
regime. The Tribunal is of the view that Spain should not substantially alter the
regulatory framework that was applicable to the Claimants’ investment or alternatively,

subject it to periods of legal uncertainty, thereby violating the stability provision.

544. Spain relies on the decision in Charanne® to contend that an investor like the
Claimants, cannot have an expectation that the regulatory framework will not be
modified and also for the proposition that an investor like the Claimants, should
investigate the regulatory framework and how it is applied and in what manner it would
affect its investment. The Tribunal is of the view that this decision is distinguishable

for a number of reasons:

(a) the disputed measures in Charanne are different from the disputed measures

in the present dispute; and

(b) the evidence that was led in the present dispute is different from the

evidence in Charanne.

545. The Tribunal notes that the claim in Charanne dealt with PV installations and was only
concerned with RDL 14/2010 caps on a number of hours to which the PV installations
were entitled to under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 and these changes were
implemented in December 2010 and did not affect wind farms. Spain by implementing
RD 1614/2010 in December, reconfirmed the guarantee that RD 661/2007 tariff on wind
farms would not be modified. The tribunal in Charanne also did not consider the
disputed measures which are the subject matter of the present dispute. RDL 14/2010

imposed an hour’s cap for PV installation, which did not alter the tariff.

546. The majority award in Charanne expressly limited its decision to the 2010 changes to

the PV sector as evidenced by the following passage from the award:

In this context, limited to the 2010 rules only, the Arbitr[al] Tribunal cannot
draw the conclusion that Spain has violated its obligation to [provide]
regulatory stability.°*

547. The majority took care to note that it did not “intend to prejudge in any way the
conclusions that could be reached by another arbitr[al] tribunal could reach based on

the analysis of all the regulations adopted to date, including the 2013 regulations...”°**

548. The Charanne award indicates that it addressed two documents°>

and hence the key
contemporaneous documents which have been considered in this present dispute, were
not considered. There were also no fact witnesses in Charanne. The Tribunal, for the

reasons set out above, would decline to follow the majority award in Charanne.

549. The Tribunal has to consider what were the stable conditions for investors prior to the
Claimants’ investment because stability is an important consideration. This was

recognised in RD 661/2007 whereby investors were offered certainty with regard to:

(a) the exact cents per kWh that RE installations would receive per unit of
production;°°

(b) the sale of RE installations’ entire production;°”’ and

(c) the stability of FIT and its protection against its revision for existing

installations.°*

550. Article 44(3) is important as it protects existing installations against changes in the FIT,
which change is otherwise permissible under Spanish law. Article 44(3) reads as

follows:

In 2010, in view of the results of the follow-up reports on the extent to which
the Renewable Energy Plan for 2005-2010 and the Energy Savings and
Efficiency Plan for Spain (E4) have been achieved, as well as the new
objectives included in the next Renewable Energy Plan for 2011-2020,

tariffs, premiums, additional payments, and lower and upper thresholds set
out in this royal decree will be reviewed, taking into account the costs
associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of the
special regime in meeting demand and its impact on the technical and
economic management of the system, guaranteeing reasonable returns with
reference to the cost of money on capital markets. Every four years
thereafter a new adjustment will be carried out using the above criteria.

The adjustment to the regulated tariff and the lower and upper threshold
referred to in this section will not affect the facilities for which the start-up
document was issued before January | of the second year in which the
adjustment was implemented.°”

551. The Tribunal will now consider the conduct of Spain to determine whether it provided

a stable regime.

(a) The CNE, in February 2007, stated as follows:

The CNE understands that transparency and predictability in the future of
economic incentives reduces regulatory uncertainty, which incentivises
investments in new capacity and minimises the cost of financing projects,
thus reducing the final cost to the consumer. The regulation must offer
sufficient guarantees to ensure that the economic incentives are stable and
predictable throughout the service life of the facility.°°

Ultimately, what the CNE proposes is regulatory stability to recover
investments, maintaining regulated tariffs during the service life of existing
facilities (with a transparent annual adjustment mechanism).*!

The CNE also confirmed that Article 44(3) was an important provision which provided

stability and legal certainty.°?

(b) Spain issued a press release which accompanied the issuance of RD

661/2007 in the following terms:

162

[f]uture adjustments to said tariffs will not affect installations which are
already in operation. This guarantees legal certainty for the electricity
producer and stability for the sector.

(c) InvestInSpain and the relevant Ministry reiterated that under RD 661/2007
FIT regime “[t]he subsequent revisions of the tariffs will not affect the installations

which have already been commissioned. This guaranty provides legal certainty to

the producer, ensuring the stability and development of the sector.”°*

(d) In a CNE presentation dated 29 October 2008, RD 661/2007 was referred

in the following terms:

Regulatory stability: Predictability and certainty of economic incentives
for the duration of the facility’s life span (encourages investors and lower
financial costs): no retroactive effect.°>

552. The CNE in 3 separate documents in 2009 and 2010,%* reiterated its position. A joint

Ministry and InvestInSpain publication from November 2009%*” reiterated the stability

provisions and this was confirmed by ECOFYS.°**

553. The Tribunal is of the view that this conduct on the part of Spain and the documentary

evidence referred to above, demonstrate that Spain had created stable conditions for

Project Companies prior to the Claimants’ investment and the intention of Spain was

designed to provide long term stability to investors.

Spain by enacting RD 1614/2010° which provided that any future changes to RD
661/2007 would not apply to duly registered existing installations, further confirmed to

provide investors, such as the Claimants, stability.

Spain, between 2012 and 2013, enacted a number of legislative measures which, in the
Tribunal’s view, took away the stability provisions that it had undertaken to provide

under RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010.

6. Disputed Measures

The Tribunal will now address whether Spain reneged on its investment and adopted
measures, which curtailed and repealed the legal and economic regime under which the
Claimants had made their investment and also, if the measures were retroactive.

Spain enacted the following measures:

(i) in December 2012, Spain enacted Law 15/2012 which imposed a 7% levy
on electricity produced and fed into the National Grid during the calendar
year which included all generators;

(ii) in February 2013, Spain enacted RDL 2/2013 which took away the
Claimants’ premium option. This legislation also replaced the annual
adjustment index based on the Spanish CPI for updating the FIT capital to
account for inflation;

(iii) on 12 July 2013, Spain, pursuant to RDL 9/2013, amended the 1997
Electricity Law and repealed RD 661/2007 and established a new regime
for RE power generations which was radically different from the framework
established by RD 661/2007. This new regime was not fully implemented

until June 2014 and hence there was an 11-month period of uncertainty;

9 RD 1614/2010 of 7 December 2010, Articles 4-5, Exhibit C-46.

164

(iv) in December 2013, Law 24/2013 was introduced whereby the distinction
between the ordinary regime and the special regime announced by RDL
9/2013 disappeared. Conventional and RE generators were put on an equal
footing thereby depriving RE installations of the unconditional right of
priority of grid access and priority of despatch that have existed under the
previous regime. The Law of 24/2013 also established the concept of
“reasonable return” over the entire useful life of the plant;

(v) in June 2014, Spain enacted RD 413/2014 which would apply to RE
installations; and

(vi) on 16 June 2014, the Ministerial Order was approved and it was published
on 20 June 2014.

558. The Tribunal has to consider whether Spain in the exercise of its sovereign rights, can

enact the Disputed Measures.

559, The Tribunal refers to the Eiser decision as it is relevant and especially as it concerns
an investment into Spain’s CSP sector pursuant to the specific commitments offered by
RD 661/2007 and confirmed by RD 1614/2010. The Tribunal in Eiser recognised the
sector specific nature of the ECT, which was designed to address specific characteristics
of investment in the energy sector especially the long term and capital intensive nature.
The Eiser decision recognised that the ECT obligates Spain to provide investors with a

stable framework in the following manner:

[I]n interpreting ECT’s obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment,
interpreters must be mindful of the agreed objectives of legal stability and
transparency.°
560. The Eiser tribunal also recognised that the ECT’s obligation to provide stability does
not prevent the State from exercising its sovereign rights to regulate, but, if the State

regulates in a manner that there is a breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT, then there is a

4 May 2017, { 379, Exhibit CL-154.

165

frustration of the legitimate expectations. By undermining the legal framework, Spain

has to pay compensation.

561. The Tribunal also relies on the decision in Eiser where the tribunal held that the purpose

of the ECT is to ensure that legal frameworks are “stable, transparent and compliant

with international standards.”

562. The Tribunal adopts the following passage from the Eiser decision:

Article 10(1)’s obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment necessarily
embraces an obligation to provide fundamental stability in the essential
characteristics of the legal regime relied upon by investors in making long-
term investments. This does not mean that regulatory regimes cannot
evolve. Surely they can. ... However, the Article 10(1)’s obligation to
accord fair and equitable treatment means that regulatory regimes cannot be
radically altered as applied to existing investments in ways that deprive
investors who invested in reliance to those regimes of their investment’s
value.”

563. The Eiser decision confirms that the Claimants were entitled to an expectation that the

Spanish regime in which they invested, would not be radically altered in respect of

existing investments. The Tribunal adopts the persuasive reasons of the Eiser Tribunal.

7. Retroactivity

564. Spain claims that the Disputed Measures are not “retroactive” under domestic or
international law®* and it relies on the decisions in Nations Energy v. Panama and

Charanne® to support its view on the non-retroactivity of the measures. These

decisions do not assist Spain’s case.° The Nations Energy decision is irrelevant in the
Tribunal’s view, as the issue of retroactivity was considered under Panamanian law and

not in circumstances which are relevant to the facts in the present dispute.

565. In Charanne, the claimants had argued that there is a principle of international law
prohibiting a State from taking regulatory measures with immediate effect per se.°*”
The Claimants’ position in the present case is different. The Claimants’ case is that
Spain implemented the Disputed Measures in circumstances where it promised investors
in return for their investment, that it would not do so. The Claimants contend that this

constitutes a breach by Spain of its international obligations.“*

566. The Eiser tribunal also held that the Disputed Measures were retroactive in the following
terms:

Respondent then retroactively applied these ‘one size fits all’ standards to
existing facilities, like Claimants’, that were previously designed, financed
and constructed based on the very different regulatory regime of RD
661/2007. No account was taken of existing plants’ specific financial and
operating characteristics in establishing their remuneration.”

567. The RREEF Decision recognised the retroactive nature of the New Regime in that it
“subtracts past remuneration (remuneration that was due under the previous regime)

from the future remunerations.”®° This finding of the RREEF Decision is not supported

6 In Nations Energy v Panama, the tribunal was comprised of Alexis Mourre (President), Claus von Wobeser (Respondent
appointed) and Jose Maria Chillon Medina (Claimant appointed). The majority decision was reached by Alexis Mourre and Clause
von Wobeser, with Jose Maria Chillon Medina dissenting. In Charanne, the tribunal was comprised of Alexis Mourre (President),
Clause von Wobeser (Respondent appointed) and Guido Santiago Tawil (Claimant appointed). The majority decision was reached
by Alexis Mourre and Claus von Wobeser, with Guido Santiago Tawil dissenting. Both dissenting opinions differed with the
majority on the retroactivity analysis.

by a number of awards which have found that Spain did promise investors that it would

not alter retroactively the specific tariffs of RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010.°!

568. The Tribunal has to consider the effect of these regulations which Spain has enacted to

the regulatory framework which existed prior to the Claimants’ investment.

569. The Tribunal is of the view that stability cannot exist when Spain continuously changes
its legislation and that Spain’s conduct from December 2012 breaches the concept of a
stable and predictable environment for the Claimants’ investment. The Tribunal is
therefore of the view that Spain’s conduct demonstrates quite categorically that it failed
to provide a stable and predictable regulatory regime. The Tribunal is of the view that
Spain is entitled to enact legislation which would breach its stability commitment.
However, Spain, in the Tribunal’s view, is not entitled to enact Disputed Measures
which would result in Spain breaching its international obligations under the ECT and
thereby whittling away measures which the Claimants relied upon to make their
investment. The Disputed Measures are, in the Tribunal’s view, a retroactive overhaul

of the RD 661/2007 economic regime.

570. The Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent’s course of conduct in enacting the
Disputed Measures in particular RDL 9/2013, Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014, Ministerial
Order 1045/2014, taken as a whole, violated FET standard as set out in Article 10(1) of
the ECT and this breach crystallised on 20 June 2014, which is relevant to determine

8. Due Diligence

The Tribunal will now consider whether the Claimants, prior to investing in the RE
sector, had conducted their due diligence.

The argument of Spain is that the due diligence conducted by the Claimants was flawed,
as a consequence, they misunderstood the regulatory framework. Spain also contends
that all the due diligence reports were obtained prior to the Claimants making the
investment, thereby the Claimants ought to have known that there would be no

guarantee or commitment, that the RE remuneration regime would not change. °°?

The Claimants took legal advice from Allen & Overy and a Memorandum was produced
so that they could ascertain the understanding of RD 661/2007 in respect of their
potential investment in T-Solar. The witness statement of Mr. Moreno®? is relevant

and the relevant paragraph of Mr. Moreno’s First Witness Statement reads as follows:

This advice gave us comfort that tariff reviews could not affect the revenues
of existing installations. Allen & Overy advised that if the Fixed Tariff was
reduced, then investors would be entitled to adequate compensation.°*

Spain further contends that the A&O Memorandum of February could not have
informed the Claimants of the applicable regulatory framework since the retroactive

changes were only approved at the end of 2010.°°

The Claimants disagree with this on the grounds that the measures RD 1565/2010 and
RDL 14/2010 concerned the PV sector and did not affect the remuneration regime of
wind installations. The Claimants also contend that these measures were highlighted in

the A&O Memorandum in the following terms:

52 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, {ff 591-592; see also Respondent's Rejoinder, { 964.

the Government has the right to legislate and implement regulations. In use
of such right, in theory, the Government may pass a new regulation, which
amends the 661/2007 Tariff in which case the Government would have to
adequately compensate the producers, according to the applicable
regulations on expropriation®°

The Tribunal also notes that the only measure which affected the wind sector, namely
RD 1614/2010, was not only previously agreed with the sector but reassured the
Claimants that the RD 661/2007 regime would remain stable with regard to the wind
farms. RD 1614/2010 confirmed that RD 661/2007 FIT would not be modified for
existing plants and confirmed that such protection included the premium. The
Claimants contend that this was their understanding and they relied on the investment

advisory paper dated 20 June 2011 which reads as follows:

The newly agreed tariff won’t be [s]ubject to additional changes and will
remain in place for the rest of the life of the operating plants. In 2010, the
Spanish government undertook a review of the remuneration scheme
applicable to renewable energies. This wind remuneration scheme review
had a meaningless impact and its scope was agreed with industry players
given the role to be played by the energy source going forward.”

Spain also argues that the opinion expressed in the A&O Memorandum was “not even

shared by the recipient of the said memorandum T-Solar.”*

The Tribunal having considered the arguments of the Claimants and the Respondent in
this issue, finds that the A&O Memorandum that was commissioned by Bridgepoint
together with other documents, was relied upon in the Claimants’ legitimate

expectations that the economic regime would not be altered by retroactive measures.

Spain also argues that the information memorandum®» in May 2011, makes reference

to the retroactive regulatory changes in the renewable energies sector that had already

occurred at the end of 2010, thereby implying that the Claimants should have been put

on notice that RD 661/2007 could be changed retroactively.°°

The Claimants, on the other hand, contend that the information memorandum is to the
contrary and that the regulatory regime governing wind farms’ remuneration, would

remain stable.

The information memorandum in the Claimants’ view, also provides that the RD
661/2007 economic regime would provide secure cash flows for the entire useful life of
the wind farms and that RD 1614/2010 would provide reassurance with regard to the
long-term stability of the RD 661/2007 regime for wind farms and the Spanish RE

framework was designed to induce investment in RE.!

The Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants are entitled to rely on the information
memorandum, namely, that the 2010 measures would have no impact on the guaranteed

remuneration schemes for wind installations.

Spain also contends that the BCG Report dated 6 July 2011 is not a due diligence report

for the following reasons:

(a) is not a legal due diligence report;

(b) recognises that future retroactive measures were possible;

(c) refers to retroactive measures that were implemented in the RE sector in
2010;

(d) warns of the effect of the tariff deficit on RE producers; and

(e) acknowledges that both the RD 661/2007 regime and the New Regime aim

to grant the same return.

584. The Claimants contend that they did not rely on the BCG Report as a legal due diligence.
BCG being experts on RE, have advised Spain on certain aspects of its RE policies and

regulations.°

585. Spain contends that the BCG Report characterisation of changes to the RD 661/2007
remuneration, is unlikely. The Claimants disagree and argue that the BCG Report did
state numerous times that RD 661/2007 FIT was guaranteed by the State and displayed
no regulatory risks. Furthermore, Spain also argues that the retroactive measures taken
at the end of 2010 and mentioned in the BCG Report, should have put investors on
notice that RD 661/2007 economic regime could be changed retroactively. The
Claimants however argue there are several references in the Report to the 2010 measures

but there is no indication that it would be subject to retroactive changes.

586. Spain also claims that the BCG Report warned of several challenges to the RE sector in
Spain such as tariff deficit and risks of future regulatory measures. The Claimants
however, contend that the Report merely emphasised that the outlook of challenges on
renewable changes have improved since 2010 and that wind contribution to system costs
would be the lowest among renewables and that the Spanish Government has accepted

a deficit in the system to maintain lower end electrical prices.

587. Spain also suggests that the BGC Report confirms that the RD 661/2007 regime and the
New Regime, would have the same target return. The Claimants contend that the report
merely asserts that the target return used in RD 661/2007 is the same as that of a Royal

Decree expected to be passed in 2011 to govern remuneration of new RE installations.

588. The Tribunal having considered the due diligence conducted by the Claimants in respect
of (a) the A&O Memorandum, (b) the information memorandum, and (c) the BCG
Report, is of the view that the due diligence exercised by the Claimants, is on the basis
that the Claimants believed they had a legitimate expectation that the laws would not be
modified especially as the above documents included a stabilisation clause.
Furthermore, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants did undertake an appropriate

fact-finding mission in Spain with a view to their investments in RE.

589. The Tribunal believes that there is no basis for Spain to contend that the Claimants have
not exercised proper due diligence with regards to their proposed investment in the RE

sector in Spain.

9. Transparency

590. The next issue that the Tribunal has to address is whether Spain’s conduct was
transparent. The FET standard requires that Spain’s conduct towards the Claimants and

the legal environment must be transparent.

591. The Tribunal refers to the ECT decision in Electrabel v. Hungary where the tribunal

held as follows:

Article 10(1) ECT not only speaks of fair and equitable treatment and
equitable and stable conditions, it also refers to ‘favourable and transparent
conditions.’ The reference to transparency can be read to indicate an
obligation to be forthcoming with information about intended changes in
policy and regulations that may significantly affect investments, so that the
investor can adequately plan its investment and, if needed, engage the host
State in dialogue about protecting its legitimate expectations. Finally, the
term “favourable” suggests the creation of an_ investor-friendly
environment.°™

592. The Tribunal also refers to the decision in Plama v. Bulgaria where the tribunal held as

follows:

64 Electrabel S.A. v The Republic 0, tanga: ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability,
30 November 2012, { 7.79, Exhibit CL-

173

[T]he condition of transparency, stated in the first sentence of Article 10(1)
of the ECT, can be related to the standard of fair and equitable treatment.
Transparency appears to be a significant element for the protection of both
the legitimate expectations of the Investor and the stability of the legal
framework. °°

593. The Tribunal having considered the conduct of Spain, holds that Spain did dismantle

the RD 661/2007 economic regime which was not transparent for the following reasons:

(i) There was in the Tribunal’s view, no urgent need for RD 661/2007 to be
modified. Royal Decree Laws are issued by Spain to implement a new
regime and they are only issued in cases of extraordinary and urgent

need;

(ii) RDL 9/2013 was responsible for the Claimants’ investment being
destroyed. There was then an 11-month period during which Spain did not
give any indication with regard to the remuneration that the qualifying

plants would be entitled to;

(iii) RD 413/2014 and the June 2014 Order did not provide any analysis
explaining the underlying reasons behind the Special Payment or in what
manner the future updates of the economic regime would be

underpinned;

(iv) | There was also a lack of visibility and predictability under the new regime,

especially as Spain retained the right to review the Special Payment in order

capable of being readily known to all affected investors”) and Joseph Charles Lemire v Ukraine, CSID Case No. ARB/06/18,
Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 21 January 2010, 4 284, Exhibit CL-72 noting that a breach of the FET standard can be
evaluated against a number of factors, including “whether there is an absence of transparency in the legal procedure or in the
actions of the State”.

to ensure that the prevailing yield on the 10-year Spanish bonds will be

considered to be a reasonable return;

(v) The Special Payment which consisted of two distinct elements, namely a
remuneration per MW of installed capacity and a remuneration per MWh
of electricity produced seeking to cover operating costs cannot be met by
market prices but Spain did not provide a clear indication with regard to the
time frame during which remuneration for the installed capacity would

apply; and

(vi) | The abolishment of the CNE and the replacement with the CMMC after the
CNE criticised the new regime during the drafting process of RD 413/2014.

594. The above-mentioned acts on the part of Spain demonstrates that Spain’s conduct was

not transparent.

10. Were Spain’s measures unreasonable?

595. The word “unreasonable” is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as “beyond the
limits of acceptability or fairness.’°° The tribunal in Plama v Bulgaria defined
“unreasonable” in the following terms “those which are founded in reason or fact but
on caprice, prejudice or personal preference.”®” The Tribunal is of the view in order
to determine whether Spain’s conduct has been reasonable, it requires a demonstration

that the conduct “bears a reasonable relationship to some rational policy.”°"

The Tribunal in Micula v. Romania held as follows:

... [Flor a state’s conduct to be reasonable it is not sufficient that it be
related to a rational policy; it is also necessary that, in the implementation
of that policy, the state’s acts have been appropriately tailored to the pursuit
of that rational policy with due regard for the consequences imposed on
investors.°”

The Tribunal in order to determine if Spain’s measures are unreasonable, must identify
arational policy goal and it must then demonstrate that these measures were reasonable.
The Tribunal is of the view that Spain cannot satisfy this test because having induced
the Claimants to invest, there was a sudden and drastic change in Spain’s policy with
regard to the RE industry and the legal and regulatory framework was amended over a

period of time.

The Tribunal refers by way of analogy to the decision in BG v. Argentina where the said
tribunal stated that “withdrawal of undertakings and assurances given in good faith to
investors as an inducement to their making an investment is by definition unreasonable

and a breach of the treaty.’°

The wind farms were duly registered with RAIPRE by 9 December 2010 and the
Claimants were entitled to the RD 661/2007 economic regime. Spain attempts to justify
its regulatory measures due to a tariff deficit but a tariff deficit is a result of Spain’s own
regulatory conduct and hence cannot be attributed to the Claimants. This conduct is, in
the Tribunal’s view, a violation of the Claimants’ reasonable and_ legitimate
expectations. The tariff deficit had existed long before the development of wind farms
in Spain and hence the drastic changes to the regulatory regime for renewables cannot

be a rational policy goal.

604.

The Tribunal finds that Spain by dismantling the legal and business framework which
was applicable to the Claimants’ investment, is in the circumstances, a measure which

was unreasonable.

11. Are Spain’s measures disproportionate?

It is a well-established principle in domestic laws as well as the Investment Treaty
Arbitration that there must be a requirement of proportionality.°“* The Tribunal is of
the view that the test of proportionality was not satisfied by Spain because Spain’s
objective as stated, was to address the issue of tariff deficit yet it imposed retroactive
changes to the FIT, thereby destroying the RD 661/2007 economic regime and that, in
the Tribunal’s view, is not an appropriate solution to the problem. Furthermore, FIT for
wind plants only played a rather limited role in the accumulation of tariff deficit. The
Tribunal finds that the regulatory measures by Spain which curtailed the FIT for wind,
frustrated the legitimate expectations of the Claimants. These measures cannot in the

Tribunal’s view be considered as suitable measures.

The other consideration is whether Spain’s measures were necessary to achieve the
goals that it wished to pursue especially when there were less intrusive means available
to achieve Spain’s goal. Spain’s State organs did identify alternative solutions such as

tax on all CO2 emissions.°”>

The Tribunal is therefore of the view that Spain’s actions were disproportionate.

12. Were the Claimants’ investment impaired as a result of Spain’s measures?

Article 10(1) of the ECT prohibits Spain by “unreasonable or discriminatory measures”

from impairing the Claimants’ investment. The Tribunal therefore has to ascertain if

7 March 2012, pp. 16-64, Exhibit C-166.

177

the measures are either unreasonable or discriminatory. The Tribunal refers to the
decision in Saluka which states that the standard of reasonableness requires “‘State’s
conduct bear a reasonable relationship to some rational policy”®”. The measures that
Spain took were unreasonable and breached the FET standard because Spain’s primary
justification was because of the growing tariff deficit and the tariff deficit was the result
of disparity between the regulated costs and the income of the electricity system which
is dependent on the regulated price of the electricity. The tariff deficit could have been
avoided if Spain had set consumer prices as it was required to do under Article 17 of the
1997 Electricity Law and RDL 6/2009. The Tribunal is of the view that the tariff deficit
is a result of Spain’s regulatory failures and therefore it is conduct which does not bear
a reasonable relationship to Spain’s policy. These measures were therefore harmful to

the Claimants’ plants.

605. The Tribunal also notes that the Spanish Supreme Court did issue judgments finding
that Spain had failed to comply with the requirements of RDL 6/2009 and hence there

was a violation of Spanish law.

606. The Tribunal concludes that Spain is not only in violation of the FET standard under the

ECT, but that Spain also violated its obligations under Article 10(1).
H. Umbrella Clause

1. Claimants’ position

607. The Claimants argue that the purpose of an umbrella clause (such as Article 10(1) of the
ECT) is to bring the host State’s compliance with commitments assumed vis-a-vis

investors under the protective “umbrella” of the ECT.°”

76 Saluka Investments B.V. v The Czech Republic, UNCITRAL, Partial Award on Jurisdiction and Merits, 17 March 2006, {{ 460,
Exhibit CL-43.

67 Claimants’ Memorial, J 453.

178

608. The Claimants explained that as a matter of international law, States may undertake
binding legal obligations towards investors through the adoption of general legislation.
The power of States to assume binding legal obligations through their unilateral acts has
been affirmed by the International Court of Justice on several occasions. The Claimants
affirm that the umbrella clause is so broad that it could be interpreted to cover all kinds
of obligations, explicit or implied, contractual or non-contractual, undertaken with
respect to investment generally.°”* In particular, the expression “[a]ny obligations” in
this umbrella clause “means not only obligations of a certain type, but ‘any' — that is to

9679

say, all — obligations’”®"”, including obligations that the host State assumed unilaterally

through legislation or executive acts.°*°

609. The Claimants sustain that pursuant to RD 661/2007 (and, in particular, Articles 36 and
44(3)) and RD 1614/2010 (in particular, Article 5(3)), Spain expressly recognised the
application of the RD 661/2007 regulatory regime to the Project Companies, for the
entire operational lifetime of the installations. Those commitments are binding

obligations on Spain towards the Claimants’ investment, which Spain must honour.

610. As seen above, according to the Claimants, RD 661/2007 contained strong stabilization
commitments and in RD 1614/2010 Spain reiterated its guarantee that any revisions to
the FIT pursuant to Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 would not affect duly registered,

existing installations.®*!

611. Therefore, in Claimants’ view, it cannot be disputed that under RD 661/2007 and RD

1614/2010, the Government entered into obligations with the Claimants within the

78 Claimants’ Memorial, { 454. See also United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Bilateral Investment Treaties in
the Mid-1990s (United Nations Publications, 1998), p. 56, Exhibit CL-15.

meaning of Article 10(1) of the ECT. These obligations consisted of the payment of the
FIT (as amended by RD 1614/2014) for all the electricity produced by the installations

and for their entire operational lifetime.”

The Claimants sustain that the plain language of the Umbrella Clause in Article 10(1)
of the ECT does not differentiate between contractual obligations and legislative or
regulatory undertakings.*** The Claimants affirm that this broad scope can be limited at
the election of the Contracting Party. For example, Spain could have limited scope of
the Umbrella Clause and carved it out from investor-State disputes in the same way that
Australia, Hungary and Norway have done (see Article 26(3)(c) and Annex IA of the
ECT). Spain chose not to. Consequently, the Umbrella Clause applies to all
commitments made by Spain, and “even representations made by ministers to investors

during investment promotion ‘road shows.””°**

According to the Claimants, the cases cited by the Respondent to support its position as
to the extension of the umbrella clause of the ECT do not assist Spain’s position. In the

Claimants’ view:

(a) SGS v. Philippines recognised that umbrella clauses may cover
obligations other than those derived from contractual agreements and thus
supports the Claimants' proposition;

(b) AES Summit Generation Limit v. Hungary®*

concerned, inter alia, the
contractual rights of the investor. The Claimants state that the tribunal

held that it could not rule on the scope of the contractual obligations

because under Annex IA of the ECT, Hungary had not allowed investors
to submit a dispute concerning the Umbrella Clause to an international

tribunal;

(c) Plama v. Bulgaria,®*" Eureko v. Poland,®® Enron v. Argentina®? and
LG&E v. Argentina® contain clear findings that the Umbrella Clause is
not limited to contracts between the State and the investor but covers

“Ta]ny obligation”;

(d) El Paso v. Argentina was not concerned with legislative acts falling
within the scope of an umbrella clause. Rather, it was focused on the
existence of any contracts or licenses that could potentially found a treaty
claim. That tribunal made no findings on the issue of whether state

promises found in legislation can form the basis of an umbrella-claim.™!

614. According to the Claimants, starting in December 2012, Spain passed a series of laws
and regulations, which first modified the RD 661/2007 legal and economic regime
significantly and to the Claimants' detriment and, ultimately, stripped away that regime
entirely. In Claimants’ view, that was a clear violation of the Umbrella Clause in Article

10(1) of the ECT.

2. Respondent’s position

615. The Respondent states that the Claimants’ arguments regarding the “umbrella clause”

cannot be admitted by the Arbitral Tribunal as:

(a) The interpretation the Claimants make is contrary to the literal sense of
Article 10(1) of the ECT and the interpretation thereof by doctrine and

arbitration precedents.

(b) The Kingdom of Spain has not made any direct undertakings in relation to
the Claimant or its investment through unilateral acts, as declared by one

case of arbitration precedent.®?

616. The Respondent notes that the Claimants incorrectly interpret the content and purpose
of the final subsection of Article 10(1) of the ECT, taking the application of the
“umbrella clause” beyond a reasonable interpretation. By using the expression “any”,
due to its broad nature, the Claimants would be aiming to include any type of act under
the concept of guaranteed obligation. It therefore considers that an applicable erga
omnes rule, such as RD 661/2007, are specifically agreed commitments with an investor

or their investment.%?

617. According to the Respondent, this approach implies a lack of awareness of the true scope
of the umbrella clause, as it obviates that the final subsection of Article 10(1) of the
ECT clearly uses the term “entered into” which implies that the State assumes specific

obligations with regard to a specific investor or a specific investment.*

618. The Respondent considers that the obligations of the State have to be, therefore, specific,
and have to have been assumed by the State with respect to a particular investor, in a

vis-a-vis relationship.

619. The Respondent affirms that the “ECT Reader’s Guide” produced by the ECT
Secretariat, is relevant as an ECT interpretive element. This Reader’s guide defines the

provision of the final subsection of Article 10(1) of the ECT under the significant label

“Individual investment contracts” and defines its scope by placing emphasis on its
grounding, which is none other than the international principle of pacta sunt

servanda,®>

620. The Respondent points out that the Claimants have invoked as a sole precedent that
applies the ECT, the award in the Plama case. However, the Respondent notes that in
that award the tribunal considers the existing positions in the precedents and given that
the dispute arising between the parties derived from a contract, it does not consider it
necessary to decide whether Article 10(1) last subsection covers commitments arising
from the legal rules. Accordingly, the Respondent concludes that the Claimants have
not provided a single precedent that applies the ECT and accepts its theory, according

to which, specific commitments arise from general rules “entered into” with investors.

621. In this case, the Respondent stresses that the Spanish regulatory framework, including
RD 661/2007, is erga omnes by nature and it is not aimed at any group. Tens of
thousands of Spanish and foreign people were the subjects covered by this regulation.
The claimed Regulation is not, therefore, the object of this final subsection of Article

10(1) of the ECT.

622. The Respondent alleges that the Eureko v. Poland award does not interpret “any
obligation” as obligations other than those arising from a contract. Conversely, it rules
out the interpretation of the SGS v. Pakistan award with the interpretation of the SGS v.
the Philippines award: the umbrella clause only protects obligations arising from

specific State-investor bilateral relations.°°

623. The Respondent further states that in the cases cited by the Claimants, LG&E v.
Argentina and Enron v. Argentina, the awards refer to the BIT between the United States
and Argentina and that the criterion contained in the decisions mentioned by the

Claimants has been rectified in other subsequent arbitral precedents that apply the same

United States-Argentina BIT, such as the EJ Paso v. Argentina case and CMS v.
Argentina case.°” Furthermore, unlike Argentine laws, RD 661/2007 does not contain

any specific obligation in relation to the investor or foreign investment.°®

The Respondent reiterates that RD 661/2007 is a piece of legislation passed by the
Spanish Government as part of its regulatory powers. This legislation applies to Plant
owner companies and to any electrical energy producers included in its scope of
application. Furthermore, the scope of application of this regulation was not limited to
a few subjects who met subjective requirements, rather it applied to those who met the

objective requirements established in the legislation.

The specificity requirement of the umbrella clause demands that an obligation “with an
Investor or an Investment of an Investor” must exist. RD 661/2007 was directed at any
owner of an electrical plant, regardless of both its nationality and the origin of funds

with which it is financed.”

The Respondent argues that the Agreement of June 2010 between the Ministry and the
Wind Sector is not a specific compromise with the investor, as the last subsection of

Article 10(1) ECT requires.”°!

Moreover, the Respondent states that in that Agreement there was no specific
undertaking to set in stone, neither in favour of the Associations of the renewable energy
Sector nor in favour of the Claimants nor in favour of its investment, and states that this

alleged commitment has also already been denied in the Charanne award."

628. The Respondent concludes that RD 661/2007 and 1614/2010 do not contain any of the
requirements established case law used by the Claimants to allow them to unilaterally
create obligations or specific commitments covered by the umbrella clause of the final

subsection of Article 10(1) of the ECT.

3. Tribunal’s analysis

629. The Tribunal has determined that Spain has not accorded fair and equitable treatment to
the Claimants pursuant to Article 10(1) of the ECT. The Tribunal is of the view that in
the interest of judicial economy, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to address the issue
of whether Spain violated the Umbrella Clause. The Tribunal relies on the decision in

Micula v. Romania in taking this approach, where the tribunal held as follows:

In light of the Tribunal’s conclusion that, by prematurely revoking the EGO 24
incentives in the manner that it did, the Respondent breached its obligations to treat
the Claimants’ investments fairly and equitably, the Tribunal does not need to
address the Claimants’ remaining claims. Indeed, each of those claims arises from
the same facts as the fair and equitable treatment claim, and the Claimants claim
the same compensation in each instance [...] Thus, even if the Tribunal were to
find in favour of the Claimants with respect to these claims, this would not impact
the Tribunal’s calculation of damages. As a result, any legal findings on these
matters are unnecessary. °°

630. The Tribunal will therefore not deal with the issue of the Umbrella Clause.

VIII. REPARATION

631. In light of the Tribunal’s findings in paragraphs 480 to 628 above, the Claimants have
been successful in their claim for breach of FET. The Tribunal now turns to the issue of

reparation.

185

A. Claimants’ position
1. Reparation

632. The Claimants submit that, pursuant to customary international law, they are entitled to

full reparation that would wipe out all of the consequences of Spain’s unlawful acts.’
Based on customary international law as codified in Articles 1, 28, 34-36 of the ILC
Articles, Spain is obliged to make restitution to, or alternatively compensate, the

Claimants for Spain’s wrongful acts.”

633. The Claimants say that, under international law, the primary remedy for a State’s
wrongful act is restitution.” Restitution would be effected by Spain: (i) withdrawing
all the harmful laws and regulations complained of in Claimants’ Memorial (namely the
relevant articles of Law 15/2012, RDL 2/2013, RDL 9/2013, Law 24/2013, RD
413/2014 and the June 2014 Order) and placing the Claimants under the same legal and
regulatory framework that existed at the time they made the investment; (ii)
compensating the Claimants for all losses suffered before the reinstatement of the

original regulatory regime. ’°”

634. Alternatively, if restitution is materially impossible or wholly disproportionate, full
reparation requires the Claimants be compensated for any financially assessable

damages, including loss of profits, caused by the Disputed Measures.7°*

2. Standard of compensation

635. The ECT provides no compensation standard for breach of Article 10 of the ECT.”
Therefore, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to turn to customary international law for the
applicable standard of relief. The Claimants claim that the standard of compensation for
the Respondent’s breach of FET is the difference between the fair market value of their
investment with and without the Disputed Measures.’!° The Claimants rely on the
Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method to establish the fair market value in the

different scenarios (discussed further below).

3. Valuation date

636. The Claimants value their investment at 20 June 2014.7!! The Claimants acknowledge

that, generally, damages flowing from a breach are valued at the date of harm.7!”
However, where a State has implemented multiple measures that cause harm, investor-
State tribunals have had regard to the valuation date for indirect expropriation i.e. the
date the investor was irreversibly deprived of the property.’'> Further, this irreversible
deprivation test is also apposite for cases involving a breach of FET, however the test is

slightly different, being the date the most serious damage was suffered.7!+

637. On 20 June 2014 was when Spain published Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014
(approved on 16 June 2014), which sets out the precise economic parameters for
calculating the Special Payment under the New Regime i.e. defining the tariffs applying
to the Claimants’ wind installation. It is the Claimants’ position that 20 June 2014 is the

most appropriate date to measure harm because it “represents the ultimate act of a two-
year legislative backlash” which wiped out the value of the Claimants’ investments.’!°

This date also allows Brattle to accurately forecast cash flows and the likely financial

performance of the Claimants’ investments.7!°

4. Proof

638. The Claimants do not appear to dispute that they bear the burden of proving their loss.
However, they assert that the standard of proof for the quantification of loss is lower
than that for the existence of the loss.”!7 The Claimants cite Lemire v. Ukraine for the
proposition that the existence of loss must be “proved with reasonable certainty”
however for quantification all that is required is that they provide “a basis upon which

the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss?.™'8

5. Valuation method

639. The Claimants consider that the DCF method is the most appropriate method to assess
the fair market value of their investments.’!? This is because it accurately captures the
lost future cash flows by: projecting the likely revenues and expenses, year by year, and
then applying a discount rate to the future cash flows to calculate the net present value
taking into account both market risk and the time value of money.’?? The DCF method
is particularly appropriate because: (i) it is pliable and can account for regulatory risk in
different scenarios; (ii) it is the most prevalent method of valuing power stations; and
(iii) wind farms have very simple business models.’*! The Claimants further say that the
Respondent’s criticisms of the DCF method are misplaced because: (i) investment-

treaty jurisprudence favours the application of the DCF method;’”? and (ii) the future

cash flows of their investment are sufficiently certain because it is mostly based on

objective data.’

640. The Claimants reject the Respondent’s preferred valuation method, asset-based
valuation (“ABV”) primarily because the ABV analysis fails to assume the
Respondent’s liability for a breach of the ECT by implementing the new regime.’”*
Further, the Claimants say that the fact they made a profit on the sale of their investments
does not suggest that there was no value deterioration as a result of the Disputed
Measures, rather the question is whether they could have obtained more without the

Disputed Measures. ’”°

6. DCF analysis

641. The Claimants’ expert put forward a DCF valuation for a primary claim and an
alternative claim: (i) the primary claim flows from a finding on the merits that the
Claimants had a legitimate expectation to obtain the tariffs under RD 661/2007; and (ii)
the alternative claim flows from a finding that the only legitimate expectation the

fs.’2° Given the

  

Claimants had was to receive the return that was implicit in those tari
Tribunal’s findings at paragraph 527 above that the Claimants had a reasonable and
legitimate expectation to tariffs under RD 661/2007, only the primary claim DCF

valuation is summarised.

642. Brattle conducts a three-step damage valuation.

a. First, Brattle measures the lost historical cash flows of the Claimants’
investments resulting from the Disputed Measures by comparing the cash
flows from 27 December 2012 (the commencement of the Disputed

Measures) to June 2014 (the Valuation Date) under two scenarios: “Actual”

based on the actual historical financial data for the Claimants’ investments;
and “But-for” calculated on the assumption that the Disputed Measures

were never implemented. ’?”

b. Secondly, Brattle estimates the loss in the fair market value of the
Claimants’ investments as at June 2014 under the But-for and Actual
scenarios using a DCF method.’* Brattle develops two versions of DCF
model.’?? The Actual model which calculates the projected future cash
flows in the Actual scenario. The But-for model, which is identical to the
Actual model save for two differences: (i) it assumes the continued
application of FITs as specified under RD 661/2007 starting in January
2013; and (ii) it assumes less regulatory risk than exists under the Actual
scenario. For each DCF model, Brattle projects future cash flows and then

discounts those cash flows to reflect risk.

c. Thirdly, Brattle calculates the pre-award interest owing from June 2014 to

the notional award date of November 2018 and the tax gross-up.”°

643. Brattle’s updated DCF valuation values the Claimants’ damages at EUR 123.9

million,”*! prior to third step.”
7. Interest rate

644. The Claimants have claimed both pre-award and post-award interest on the amounts due
and rely on Article 13 of the ECT, which provides that interest will be calculated “at a
commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of expropriation until the

date of payment”

The Claimants also rely on Article 38 of the ILC which reads as follows:

interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when
necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of
calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.

The Claimants also rely on the 10 year Spanish Government Bonds in force as a basis

for calculating pre-award interest as set out in the Brattle Report.”

The Claimants rely on a number of decisions of tribunals which have held that an award

of damages should bear interest.’*4

The Claimants contend that there should be different rates for pre-award and post-award
interest as they serve different purposes. Pre-award interest is awarded to achieve full

reparation whilst post-award interest is to ensure that the award is paid promptly.

The Claimants claim the sum of 1.16% compounded monthly as pre-award interest,
being the commercial rate established on a market basis and rely on the Quantum

Report”.

The Claimants are of the view that the Tribunal should award post-award interest at a

higher rate than 1.16% and also should be compounded on a monthly basis.

8. Gross-up for tax

The Claimants claim that full reparation requires a “gross-up over the amount awarded

for damages” to ensure the Claimants are placed in the same position they would have

Netherlands will be treated as a taxable profit and subject to tax rate of 20% up to and

including EUR 200,000 and 25% on further amounts. 738

The Claimants primarily rely on a decision of the Court of Gelderland, where the Court
held that a compensation payment received from a breach of a BIT was subject to Dutch
corporate income tax.’*? The Claimants have requested a tax ruling from authorities in
the Netherlands but have not received it to date.’*° Brattle did not analyse the potential
tax consequences but noted the need to add a tax gross-up if an award did attract

corporate taxes. ’*!

Respondent’s position
1. Reparation

The Respondent submits that no reparation is required because “the legal and regulatory
regime, from 1997 to present day, has always granted the same thing, a reasonable
ret[]u[r]n. As such, there is no claim to be made if the Claimant has not been deprived
of anything nor is there any damage to speak of.”"*” The Respondent did not dispute the
reparation principles quoted by the Claimants, nor provide any response as to the

appropriateness or otherwise of reparation by restitution or compensation.

2. Alternatively, compensation

The Respondent reiterates that “the disputed measures have not generated any damage
to the Claimants. On the contrary, the disputed measures have provided greater stability
in the Spanish electrical sector and have thus increased the value of the Claimants’
investment”.” The Respondent cites the fact that the Claimants acquired the assets for
€91 million in 2012 and sold them for €133 million in 2016 to suggest that no damage

was suffered, rather the value increased. /“*

The Respondent did not dispute the compensation standard.

3. Valuation date

The Respondent, without citing an alternative date or any reasons, says that the valuation
date of 20 June 2014 is a date randomly chosen by the Claimants.’4° However, the

Respondent’s expert has adopted the June 2014 date when calculating quantum.”4°

4. Proof

The Respondent, citing Gemplus v. Mexico, points out that it is the Claimants who bear
the overall burden of proving the loss founding their claims for compensation.’*” The
Tribunal should reject the Claimants’ claims, even if liability is established, where the

loss claimed is too uncertain or speculative.

5. Valuation method

The Respondent contends that the DCF method is inappropriate to use in this case
because it is overly speculative. The following factors indicate the DCF method might
lead to unnecessary levels of speculation: (i) the investments were capital-intensive with
no relevant intangible assets; (ii) there is high dependency on volatile cash flows; (iii)
the long-term nature of the forecasts increases uncertainty; and (iv) there is a
disproportion between the alleged investments and the amount claimed; (v) there is an
insufficient history of operations; and (vi) the economic conditions were constantly

fluctuating. ”4*

The Respondent instead argues for the application of the ABV method, which is less
speculative and simpler to apply.” In the Respondent’s view, the ABV “is relevant to
verify if the Disputed Measures have undermined the investors’ legitimate entitlement
to earn at least the opportunity cost of the capital.””° The Respondent’s quantum
expert, Accuracy, finds that there is no damage to the Claimants after undertaking an
ABV of their investments.’>! This involves: (i) calculating the investment amount and
the project return in a But-For and Actual scenario; and (ii) comparing the NPV obtained
from each scenario to determine whether the Disputed Measures have had a financial

impact on the plants.”*>?

The Respondent also relies on the RREEF Decision where the tribunal considered the
DCF method was not useful to calculate the reasonable rate of return enshrined in the
Spanish Energy Regulators Framework which was to have a general scope and to apply

to projects of all kinds.’°

758 Second Accura

6. Alternatively, “corrected” DCF analysis

Accuracy, alternatively to the ABV, undertakes a subsidiary calculation using Brattle’s
financial model at June 2015, correcting for a series of incorrect assumptions and
parameters. ’>* These are discussed further below in the Tribunal’s analysis, but include:
(i) the reference point for the Actual scenario value; (ii) the operational life of the Plants;
(iii) the discount rate and (iv) the regulatory risk premium. Accuracy advocates for other

adjustments which have an admittedly “lower impact on Brattle’s But-For”.”>

7. Interest rate

The Respondent relies on the Accuracy Report”*° dated 10 February 2017 which reads

as follows:

In our opinion, in the case of determining damages as at the valuation date,
to update it for the date of the award, a risk-free asset appropriately covering
the timeframe ought to be used as a benchmark. For this purpose, the
equivalent rate of the Spanish government bonds at 4-5 years, which is the
period between this date and the one estimated by Brattle for the potential
payment of the compensation (November 2018). The rates applicable are
1.16% and 1.38%7°’ (4 and 5 years respectively).

There is also another Accuracy Report”** dated 8 January 2018, which reads as follows:

In our opinion, the case of determining damages as at a certain valuation
date, the value should be carried forward to award date using a risk-free rate
that appropriately covers the timeframe until the award date.”

Considering a valuation date in 2016, the valid reference for pre-award interests should

be the yield of the short-term Spanish Government bonds (2 year — 3 year bonds) which

are close to zero.” This ensures the consistency with the period between the valuation

date and the estimated date of the award.7°!

664. The Respondent also relies on a passage from the author Mark Kantor who advocates a

risk free rate”.

665. With regard to post-award interest, the Respondent is of the view that post-award
interest rate should not exceed the pre-award interest rate. The Respondent also
contends that post-award interest should not be awarded as the Tribunal should not
assume that Spain as a sovereign nation would breach a treaty obligation and neither

should it be used as a tool to punish the State and it relies on the decision in Vestey v.

163

Venezuela '°’ and also on the ILC Articles in particular Comment (4) of Article 36 which

states as follows:

Compensation corresponds to the financially assessable damage suffered by
the injured State or its nationals. It is not concerned to punish the
responsible State, nor does compensation have an expressive or exemplary
character ...7°*

666. Furthermore, the Respondent relies on the decision in Micula which equates the

treatment of pre and post-award interest in the following terms:

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal does not see why the cost of the
deprivation of money (which interest compensates) should be different
before and after the Award, and neither Party has convinced it otherwise.
Both are awarded to compensate a party for the deprivation of the use of its

funds. The Tribunal will thus award pre- and post-award interest at the
same rate. 7°

8. Gross-up for tax

The Respondent considers that the Claimants have failed to establish a legal or
evidential basis to support their tax gross-up claim.” In any event, the Respondent

contends that the claim is without basis for three reasons.

First, the tax gross-up claim is excluded by Article 21 of the ECT. 7’ Article 21(1) of
the ECT provides that “nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations
with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties”. Spain points out that the
Netherlands is a Contracting Party of the ECT. Therefore, no tax measure of the
Netherlands can create an obligation for Spain based on the ECT. Further, under

international law, a State cannot be held liable for taxes imposed by another State.’

Secondly, a damages award to the Claimants would be tax-exempt income in the
Netherlands.” The Respondent relies on a memo from R.C.A.R. Wanningen of Tax at

Work BV, a Dutch tax lawyer.””°

Thirdly, the tax gross-up claim is speculative and contingent upon the Claimants’ private

tax planning decisions and the Netherlands’ authorities’ decisions.””! The Respondent

relies on decisions of other investment tribunals to support the position that a tax claim

should be rejected where there is insufficient evidence of possible future taxation.”””

C. Tribunal’s Analysis

671. This analysis represents the majority view of the Tribunal and reference to the word
“Tribunal” in the analysis is the majority view, save for the issue of gross-up for tax,

which is dealt with in paragraphs 751 to 759 of the Award.

1. Appropriate reparation

672. Article 10 of the ECT is silent on the remedies for breach of the FET standard.

673. In these circumstances, it is appropriate for the Tribunal to apply the standard of
reparation found in customary international law. The Claimants correctly cite, and the

Respondent does not dispute, the full reparation standard articulated in Chorzéw:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act — a
principle which seems to be established by international practice and in
particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as
far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and
reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that
act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible,
payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind
would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which
would not be covered by the restitution in kind or payment in place of it —
such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of
compensation due for an act contrary to international law.

   

674. While the Claimants have made a summary request for restitution, the Tribunal
considers that restitution is an inappropriate remedy because the Respondent has a

sovereign right to take appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to meet public

interests. The Tribunal notes that similar conclusions were made in Eiser v. Spain,”

Masdar v. Spain” and Antin v. Spain."

Consequently, the Tribunal will award reparation in the form of monetary

compensation.

2. Compensation standard

It follows from above that, as the ECT is silent on the remedies for breach of the FET
standard, the ECT also does not detail any standard of compensation that the Tribunal

must apply when awarding monetary compensation for breaches of the FET.

Consequently, the appropriate standard for compensation should be based on
international law and in particular that articulated in Chorzéw, namely compensation
that will, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the Respondent’s illegal

acts.

3. Valuation date

Again, the ECT is silent on the valuation date which the Tribunal should apply when

awarding monetary compensation for breaches of FET.

The Tribunal follows the findings of the Azurix and Enron tribunals and considers that,

as it has found a series of actions by the Respondent that as an aggregate constitutes a

breach of FET, it should calculate the fair market value at the “watershed” moment or

when “the most serious damage arose in connection with” the Disputed Measures.’”°

680. The Tribunal considers that the measure concluding Spain’s course of conduct that
constituted the breach of the ECT and effecting the most serious damage to the
Claimants’ investment was Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 of 20 June 2014 as set out
in paragraph 570 above. While it is true that the Claimants were aware much earlier that
the regime in Spain was changing, it was only on 20 June 2014 that they could ascertain
the extent of the impact of the New Regime on the value of their investment. ’””

Consequently, the Tribunal finds that 20 June 2014 is the appropriate valuation date.

681. The Tribunal notes that this valuation date is consistent with the valuation date adopted

in Eiser, Masdar’® and Antin.””

4. Proof

682. The Claimants accept that they bear the burden of proof as to their claimed damages.
However, the standard of proof required for the Claimants to discharge their burden of

proof is in contention.

683. The Respondent, by citing Gemplus, appears to contend that the standard should be
sufficient certainty.’®° In Gemplus the tribunal held that when quantifying damages it

was an exercise of “sufficient certainty”."*! However, the Claimants contend that the

standard is to show the existence of damage with reasonable certainty and then only
offer a basis on which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the amount

of their loss.7°?

684. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants and adopts the approach of the Lemire tribunal.
Proving the amount of damages is a notoriously difficult task and it cannot be right that,
once liability has been established, the Claimants should be deprived of compensation

caused by a State’s wrongful acts. Other tribunals have come to similar conclusions.’*?

685. In light of the above, the Tribunal’s considers that the Claimants must prove the
existence of the fact of damage with sufficient certainty and then provide a reasonable
basis for the Tribunal to determine the amount of loss. The Tribunal considers this a fair
outcome considering that any difficulty that the Claimants may face in proving the

amount of loss will have flowed from the Respondent’s wrongdoing.

686. In the Tribunal’s view, the Disputed Measures reduced the amount payable to the
Claimants, which is most easily demonstrated by the fact that the Project Companies
had to pay claw-back payments to Spain under the New Regime as set out in paragraphs
564 to 567 above. This demonstrates that the long-term fixed feed in tariff under the Old
Regime was more valuable to the Claimants. It follows that the Tribunal is sufficiently
certain that the Claimants have, as a matter of fact, suffered damage as a result of the
Respondent’s breaches. The Tribunal now proceeds to determine whether the Claimants

have provided a reasonable basis to determine the amount of that loss.

5. Lost historical cash flows

687. As discussed above at paragraph 642a, the Claimants claim the lost historical cash flows

of the Claimants’ investments resulting from the Disputed Measures from December

2012 to June 2015 by comparing the Actual cash flows with the But-For scenario cash

flows assuming the Disputed Measures were never implemented.

688. Similar to the tribunal in Antin,”** this Tribunal has found that Spain violated the ECT
by its wholesale dismantlement of the Original Regime but not from modifying certain
of the elements of the regime. As the course of conduct constituting the breach of the
ECT reached “watershed” on 20 June 2014 as set out in paragraph 570 above, the

Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ claim for losses prior to the breach.

6. Valuation method

689. The Tribunal considers that it is appropriate to value the Claimants’ investments using
the DCF method. The Respondent’s primary objection to the DCF method’s application,
uncertainty of future cash flows, is unwarranted. The assets have been operating for a
sufficient amount of time to generate sufficiently reliable information on which to
calculate future cash flows. Further, the DCF method is widely favoured in the
renewable energy sector given that they have a simple business model with predictable

income and costs. The DCF method has been applied in a number Energy Charter

claims namely, Eiser, 785 Masdar,"*® Antin, 787 Novenergia, ** Foresight.7°

690. In any event, the Tribunal cannot accept the Respondent’s ABV which concludes that
there was no reduction in the value of the Claimants’ investments. Further, the

Respondent’s primary reason for using an ABV is because the investments “are

capital—intensive investments” and largely comprise “physical assets” 7° is
unpersuasive given that the claims comprise of lost profits and no further explanation

has been proffered.

The Tribunal has also considered the Respondent’s contention based on the RREEF
Decision namely that the DCF method is not useful and rather valuation should be
analysed by reference to the internal rate of return (IRR) and that the more appropriate

method of valuation was the WACC valuation method.”*!

In the Tribunal’s view, the RREEF Decision rejected the use of the DCF method because
that tribunal found that “the only legitimate expectations the Claimants had [...] was to
obtain the reasonable rate of return that the Respondent committed to”’? and the
reasonable return by Spanish law was the project IRR. The RREEF tribunal found that
comparing income valuations in the But-For and Actual scenario, pursuant to the DCF
method, was not a useful assessment of the reasonableness of the Claimants’ return

under both the old and the new regime. 7?

Whereas, in this case, the Tribunal has found that the Claimants legitimately expected
that the qualifying special regime installation would remain stable under RD 661/2007.
Therefore, the finding of the RREEF tribunal is inapplicable because of the Tribunal’s
findings on the merits. The DCF method is more appropriate than an IRR analysis
because it looks to the difference in the value of the Claimants’ assets before and after
changes to the regime applicable to the Claimants’ installation by a comparison of the

But-For and Actual scenarios.

(a) Discounted cash flow analysis
i. DCF analysis

The Tribunal largely accepts the DCF valuation conducted by Brattle to determine the
reduction in the fair market value of the Claimants’ investments as a result of the breach
of the ECT. Indeed, Accuracy did not challenge its methodology or many of its
assumptions. Rather, Accuracy adopted Brattle’s DCF model and “‘corrected” the inputs
they believed to be the proper assumptions.”* The Tribunal will look at each of the

main disputed assumptions below.

1. Reference point for actual scenario

Brattle estimates the June 2014 market value in both the But-For and Actual scenarios
using the DCF, which ensures consistency in the underlying expectations and valuation

environment. ”°5

Brattle rejects the reference point preferred by Accuracy, the 2016 sale price, on the
basis that the transaction reflects 2016 (and not 2014) expectations about pool prices
and interest rate levels after the valuation date.””° However, if the 2016 sale price is to
be adopted, then the valuation date must be shifted to February 2016 to ensure

consistency.”°”

Accuracy considers that the appropriate reference point for the Actual scenario is the
2016 sale price of €133 million, which was negotiated between a willing buyer and
seller thus constituting a fair market value.’ First, Accuracy discounts the sale price

using the average value of Spain’s 1-year and 2-year bond rate to account for the time

between the valuation date (June 2014) and the transaction date (February 2016).”°
Second, Accuracy adds two additional cash flows to equity (“FCFE”): (i) the capitalised
value of the historical FCFE prior to the valuation date using Spain’s 1-year bond rate;
and (ii) the discounted value of the historical FCFE between the valuation date and the
transaction date using the average value of Spain’s 1-year and 2-year bond rate.*
Accuracy concludes that the Actual value of the Claimants’ investments at the valuation

date was €124.1 million.

Given that the Tribunal has found that the appropriate valuation date is June 2014, the
Tribunal considers it inappropriate to have regard to the 2016 sale price in the Actual
scenario as it occurs after the valuation date and in different economic conditions.
Consequently, the Tribunal adopts the Actual scenario preponed by Brattle i.e.

projecting cash flows from the valuation date.

2. Operational life

Brattle assumes a 30-year operational life.*°' This assumption is based on a technical
due diligence report prepared for the sale of the Claimants’ wind projects, which
concluded that it was possible to extend the 20-year operating life to 25 or 30 years with
increased maintenance.*°? The Claimants consider this a reasonable assumption as the
Special Regime envisaged that plants would operate for at least 20 years since they
expressly provided for a FIT that would apply for the first 20 years of operation and

then for the remaining operational life of the plant from year 21 onwards. *

Brattle rejects Accuracy’s proposed 25-year operational life on the basis that: (i) it

“ignores that between purchase and sale there was an increase in the expected useful

life of the wind assets from 25 to 30 years’ ;8“ and (ii) additional costs were included in

Brattle’s DCF model to achieve a 30-year operational life.*°> In any event, Brattle

conducted a sensitivity analysis on damages in relation to a 25-year operating life.*°°

Whereas, Accuracy assumes a 25-year operational life for the But-for scenario and a 20-
year operational life for the Actual scenario.*°’ While acknowledging that the technical
due diligence report relied on by the Claimants indicates that the operating life will
exceed 20 years, it does not strictly conclude that the operating life will be 30 years.°°*

Accuracy considers that a conservative estimate is instead 25 years.*”

Accuracy also relies on the due diligence report prepared by the Claimants when they
bought the wind projects, which states the wind projects are designed for an operational

life of at least 20 years.*!° Accuracy sees no need to account for an operational life in

 

excess of what the Claimants’ explicit expectation was at the time of the acqu

As a starting point, the Tribunal consider the evidence establishes that the designed life

time of the wind projects are 20 years pursuant to IEC 61400-1 standard.*!?

The evidence on the record, prior to the 2016 sale, shows that the operational life was
expected range from 20 to 25 years. The Claimants’ initial financial models for the wind
projects entitled ‘Borawind Operating & Valuation Model’ consider a range between 20

to 25 years for the operational life.*!? The technical due diligence report prepared by

Alatec in 2011 states that the wind projects were “designed for a useful life of at least
20 years”.*'4 The Claimants have adduced no evidence prior to the sale that they

expected the operational life to range to 30 years.

Further to this, Accuracy pointed to technical publications that indicated an operational
lifetime between 20 to 25 years. The PER 2011-2020 technical study sets an operational
lifetime of 20 years.*'> The European Wind Energy Association considers that the
operational lifetime of wind projects is between 20 to 25 years.*!® Renewables First

considers that a wind turbine could operate for between 20 to 25 years.*!”

In the technical due diligence report prepared for the sale of the projects in 2016, DNV
GL opined that “it is possible to extend the service life of a wind project to 25 or 30
years" provided that the wind projects comply with a series of technical requirements,
such as passing a load and fatigue test and additional investment in maintenance is made.
However, DNV GL went to pains to state that their review “refers only to a general
understanding of the probability of extending the wind farm life beyond the 20 year IEC
design to 25 or 30 years.”*'* Further, Mr Moreno testifies that “Wind farms are expected

to have a useful life of up to 30 years without significant reinvestment.”*"

Neither party produced an expert on the operating life of wind projects. The quantum

experts confirmed at the hearing that they did not have expertise in this quarter.*?°

In light of the above, the Tribunal considers that, on balance, the operating life of the

wind projects would exceed 20 years. However, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the

operating life would reach 30 years given the caveats proffered by DNV GL and the
evidence indicating a 20-year or 25-year operating life. In these circumstances,
particularly where Spain’s own quantum expert adopts a 25-year useful life in their
quantum analysis and only dispute adopting a useful life exceeding 25 years, the

Tribunal finds that a presumed operating life of 25 years is a reasonable assumption.

3. Discount rate

709. Brattle applies a discount rate to the projected cash flows. Brattle adopts the capital asset
pricing model (“CAPM”) equation that typically relies on the statistical analysis to of
publicly traded companies deemed comparable to determine the discount rate for
systematic risk. The CAPM equation is as follows:

Discount rate = Risk free rate + (Beta x Market Risk Premium)*!

710. Brattle uses this discount rate to come to the adjusted present value (“APV”) of the
Claimants’ Project Companies. The APV approach is best practice in corporate finance
for businesses that rely on project finance, which is the case for the Claimants’ Project

Companies in Spain.

711. First, Brattle opines that the risk-free rate should be twenty-year Euribor swap rate at
June 2014 being 2.09% given the long lives of wind assets.*” While the risk free rate is
typically the Spanish government bond rate, which represent a relatively low yield for
safe investments, this should not be adopted because there is large concern over possible
Spanish default following the Global and Eurozone crises. Therefore, the Euribor rate

should be used as it does not pose a default risk.

712. Brattle rejects Accuracy’s risk-free rate which is “a combination of Accuracy’s 1.5%

inflation expectation and what Accuracy calls an (sic) “standardised interest rate” of

821 First Brattle Quantum Report, { 93.
822 First Brattle Quantum Report, ff 96-97 citing Bloomberg Data, Exhibit BQR-1.

208

2%” on the basis that this relies on Accuracy’s own assumptions and second-guesses

the prevailing long-term interest rates at June 2014.57

713. Secondly, Brattle considers the beta should be 0.5. The beta in the CAPM equation
serves as the risk adjustment factor.*4 The beta is 1.0 where the relevant investment has
exactly the same risk as the average investment, lower than 1.0 where the investment
has a lower than average risk compared to the stock market as a whole but equally an
expected lower rate of return, and higher than 1.0 where there is higher than average
risk and expected rate of return. Bloomberg, a prominent financial research firm,
publishes beta estimates for individual companies in the alternative electricity
producers’ category, based on the past performance of their stock prices compared to
the market as a whole. Brattle relies on the Bloomberg data to calculate an average
“asset beta” for similar renewable firms of 0.5.8” This is realistic given that wind assets
have highly predictable production and costs, and selling prices depend on the relevant
regulatory framework. Further, Brattle has adopted 0.5, which is at the top end of the
observed range for the average renewables sample, to be conservative as it translates to
ahigher discount rate thus reducing the present value of the Claimants’ investments and

the total damages estimate.

714. Inresponse to Accuracy’s beta estimate of 0.4, Brattle maintains that 0.5 is appropriately
conservative because it translates to a higher base-case discount rate that tends to reduce

damages.*6

715. Thirdly, Brattle contends that the market risk premium ought to be 5.5%. The market
risk premium is the amount by which an investor would expect the average investment

in the stock market to out-perform the risk-free rate.*? The CAPM assumes that

investments in the stock market should on average outperform risk-free investments as
compensation for the higher risks involved. Brattle adopts the market risk premium of
5.5% based on the range recommended by Professor Damodaran of the New York
University’s Stern School of Business, which was estimated by measuring the actual
historical performance of stocks relative to short-term government bonds over the long

run.

In response to Accuracy’s use of a 4.5% market risk premium, Brattle notes that
“reasonable people can disagree about whether the market risk premium is 4.5% or
5.5%”, however, Brattle maintains that 5.5% is preferable as it tends to reduce

damages.*?8

Using the above inputs, Brattle concludes that there is a discount rate for June 2014 of
4.84% based on a risk-free rate of 2.09%, a market risk premium of 5.5% and an asset

Beta of 0.5.5? Following the CAPM equation: 4.84% = 2.09% + (0.5 x 5.5%).

Accuracy adopts the CAPM equation used by Brattle while “correcting” certain

parameters. **?

First, Accuracy considers that a standardised risk-free rate of 3.5% should be adopted
“consistent with a long-term inflation perspective of 1.5% and a real interest rate of

29,7831

Secondly, Accuracy proposes a deleveraged beta coefficient of 0.4 for a June 20/4

832

valuation.”’~ This is based on a sample of 24 companies and calculating the average

leveraging of the companies, the beta coefficient of debt and then following that, the

deleveraged beta.**? Accuracy then undertakes a similar exercise for calculating a June

2016 deleveraged beta of 0.6.54

721, Thirdly, Accuracy adopts the market risk premium of 4.5% recommended by the Equity
Premia Around the World by Dimson, Marsh and Staunton (2011).°5

722. Using the above inputs, Accuracy concludes that there is a discount rate for June 2014
of 5.3% based on a risk-free rate of 3.5%, a market risk premium of 4.5% and an asset
beta of 0.4.8°° Following the CAPM equation: 5.3% = 3.5% + (0.4 x 4.5%). However,
in Accuracy’s second report, Accuracy concludes that there is a discount rate for June
2016 of 6.2% based on a risk-free rate of 3.5%, a market risk premium of 4.5% and an

asset beta of 0.6.°°7 Following the CAPM equation: 6.2% = 3.5% + (0.6 x 4.5%).

723. The parties’ experts both agree that the discount rate should be calculated using the
CAPM model, however they dispute the three components. The Tribunal will examine

each of these disputed components below.
a. Risk-free rate

724. The Tribunal rejects Accuracy’s risk-free rate on the basis that both the “inflation
expectation” and “real interest rate’ components were not supported by any evidence

nor any explanation as to how Accuracy arrived at these figures.

725. The Tribunal prefers the risk-free rate adopted by Brattle and considers it appropriate,
in the circumstances to adopt the twenty-year Euribor swap rate at June 2014 given the
long lives of wind assets and the need to sanitise the rate from the default risk attributed

to Spain.

b. Beta

As the Tribunal has previously adopted the valuation date of June 2014, Accuracy’s

2016 unleveraged beta coefficient is rejected.

The Tribunal adopts Brattle’s beta coefficient of 0.5 on the basis that it considers the
sampled pool is more analogous to the Claimants’ Project Companies and, in any event,
this beta coefficient is more conservative and tends to reduce damages than Accuracy’s
2014 unleveraged beta coefficient. As a sanity check, the Tribunal has regard to the fact
that Brattle’s beta coefficient of 0.5 is also very close to the average and median
unleveraged beta supplied by Accuracy once the standard deviation of 0.12 is applied,

being 0.52 and 0.49 respectively.***

c. Market risk premium

To support the market risk premium rate of 5.5%, Brattle relies on the following. First,
Professor Damodaran, considers that, since the financial crisis in 2008, the mature
market equity risk premium should be between 5-6%.**° Secondly, the average market

risk premium used by professors and analysts in 2010 ranged between 5.1% and 6%.*#°

To support the market risk premium rate of 4.5%, Accuracy relies on a study showing,

which considers the world risk premium was 4.5%.*#!

Professor Damodaran is one of the leaders in his field, and in light of the above evidence,
the Tribunal is persuaded that it would be more appropriate to apply a market risk

premium rate of 5.5%.

d. Conclusion

In light of the above findings, the Tribunal adopts Brattle’s discount rate in its entirety,
namely a discount rate for June 2014 of 4.84% based on a risk-free rate of 2.09%, a

market risk premium of 5.5% and an asset beta of 0.5.4?

4. Regulatory risk

Brattle states that the CAPM discount rates only measure systematic risk and therefore
a regulatory risk factor needs to be taken into account.*? This regulatory risk should be
calculated using a probabilistic analysis of the type that investors use when determining
the market price of a bond, in particular using the credit quality of tariff deficit securities,
which enjoy long-term tariff collections rights analogous to those of renewable

generators. *#4

Before 2012, the private tariff deficit securities were rated AAA by ratings agencies. By
June 2014, the private tariff deficit securities had deteriorated to BBB or A3 by ratings
agencies. This deterioration in credit quality reflects the introduction of regulatory risk
insofar as there were concerns that the regulator would not set electricity tariffs high
enough to permit recovery of long-term collection rights, which would lead to collection
shortfalls and reliance on the Spanish government to make up for those shortfalls in the
required repayments to lenders who funded the establishment costs of renewable

operators. *45

Brattle measures the regulatory risk for both scenarios, assigning to: (i) the Actual a
rating of BBB+, consistent with the June 2014 ratings of both the tariff deficit securities

and Spanish government bonds; and (ii) the But-for a rating of A+, which is a three-

213

notch uplift, consistent with published ratings for tariff deficit securities in the absence

of such regulatory risks, such as has occurred in Portugal.*“°

735. The regulatory risk is then translated into a revenue “haircut” by having regard to the
likelihood that Spain might not honour its tariff promises, and then uses the recovery
rate to estimate the remaining level of financial support that investors could anticipate
if Spain interfered.*4” This revenue haircut is equivalent to adding a 0.5% regulatory
risk premium to the discount rate of 4.8% derived from the CAPM in both the But-for

and Actual scenarios. *4*

736. Brattle rejects Accuracy’s increased regulatory risk premium in the But-for scenario on
a number of bases.**? First, Accuracy wrongfully attributes to the Disputed Measures
the entire decline and subsequent improvement of Spanish ratings from 2010 to the
present and into the future, the decline and improvement occurred for numerous
reasons.**” Secondly, Accuracy assumes that Spain’s tariff deficit problem could only
have been solved with the Disputed Measures yet provides no basis or analysis for this
assumption, this is because there are alternatives.*°! Thirdly, Accuracy’s claim that the
Disputed Measures reduced regulatory risk is inconsistent with market commentary.*>?
Fourthly, reducing damages for an inverted regulatory risk theory is just a denial of

liability.*53

737. Accuracy considers it more appropriate to reflect non-systemic risk as a premium in the

discount rate rather than as a revenue haircut.8™4

TAL.

For the Actual scenario, Accuracy adds a 0.5% regulatory risk premium to the discount

rate, which is, like Brattle, based on the credit rating of the tariff deficit securities.*°°

However, Accuracy considers that the But-for scenario should take into account the
continuous degradation in the sustainability of the Spanish electricity regime.**° This
degradation increases the probability of default. In the absence of the Disputed
Measures, the credit rating of the tariff deficit securities would have continued to worsen
until it reached the level of the Spanish bond i.e. BBB-, which translates to 2.2%
discount rate.*°’ Accuracy updates the regulatory risk premium to 2.5% if valued in

2016.58

For the Actual scenario, the parties’ experts agree that a 0.5% regulatory risk premium
on the discount rate, or Brattle’s equivalent regulatory haircut approach, should be
applied to be DCF valuation. The Tribunal considers it appropriate in the circumstances
to adopt the 0.5% regulatory haircut approach on the discount rate for the Actual

scenario.

For the But-for scenario, Accuracy’s estimation of an increased regulatory risk is
unpersuasive simply because it is largely predicated on the basis that introducing the
Disputed Measures was the only way to address the allegedly degrading Spanish
electricity regime. In the Tribunal’s view, the Disputed Measures raised regulatory risk
as the fixed tariff regime provided certainty for investors whereas the “reasonable rate
of return” regime is inherently uncertain being hinged to a third party’s, here Spain’s,

opinion.

744,

Consequently, the Tribunal prefers Brattle’s calculation of the discount rate for the But-
For scenario on the basis that it is unlikely the risk was higher in the But-For than in the

Actual.

5. Conclusion

The Tribunal has considered Accuracy’s other contended adjustments to Brattle’s DCF
valuation, namely: to adopt the Spanish 1-year, rather than the 10-year, bond rate to
bring forward historical cash flows;®* to exclude the financial income of the Plants from
operating cash flows;*® to measure the book value of debt rather than market value of
debt;°°! and to use only one financing side-effect, the debt tax shield, rather than all] 862
Accuracy admitted that it “basically corrected [...] two parameters of the Brattle [But-
For] model: (i) useful life [...]; and (ii) regulatory risk premium [...] other adjustments
[...] have a lower impact.”®® Similarly, at the hearing, Mr Barsalou of Accuracy stated
“the number of matters in contention was limited, although I should say the number of
material matters in contention is limited’ and referred to the three main areas of
contention being the actual scenario value, the regulatory risk and the operational life.
The Tribunal rejects Accuracy’s other adjustments to Brattle’s DCF calculation on the
basis that they are of little impact to the measure of damages and, in any event, Brattle’s

measures appear reasonable.

Applying the adjustment of operational life to Brattle’s DCF valuation, the Tribunal
finds that the diminution in the fair market value of the Claimants’ investments resulting

from the breach of the ECT was EUR 77 million at 20 June 2014.°®

7. Interest rate

745. The guiding principle when determining the applicable interest rate is to ensure full
reparation by compensating the Claimants for the loss of their ability to use the principal
compensation when it fell due. The parties correctly agree that this should be a

commercial interest rate.

746. The parties’ experts both agreed that Spanish government bond rates were an
appropriate commercial rate to apply. The Tribunal finds that the appropriate
commercial rate for pre-award interest is 1.16% being the average 10-year Spanish
government bond-rate over the relevant period on the basis that this rate is used by Spain
under the New Regulatory Regime to determine the allowed return, which indicates it
is a reasonable reference point for long-term financial interests such as those for

renewable energy plants.

747. The Tribunal considers, along with the Pezold tribunal,*® that awarding post-award
interest serves the purpose of incentivising compliance with the terms of the Award as
expediently as possible. Consequently, it is appropriate that the post-award interest rate
is 2.16% (1.16% plus an additional 1%) to incentivise Spain’s compliance with this
Award. The Tribunal agrees with the approach of previous tribunals namely in Eiser

and Masdar which have awarded both pre and post award interest compounded monthly.

748. The Tribunal further finds that interest should be compounded on a monthly basis.
Awarding compound interest accords with modern financial activity and was not

disputed by the Respondent.

749. The Tribunal having considered the submissions of the Claimants and the Respondent
on interest, is of the view that the Claimants are entitled to compound interest,

compounded on a monthly basis.

CL-159 referring to I Marboe, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law, (Oxford University
Press, 2009), 6.246, Exhibit CL-68.

217

750. The Tribunal awards interest from 20 June 2014 to the date of the Award at 1.16% per
annum, compounded monthly, and also awards post-award at the rate of 2.16% per

annum, compounded monthly from the date of the Award to the date of payment.

8. Gross-up for tax

751. The parties disagree on whether money payable under the Award will be subject to tax
in the Netherlands and therefore whether the Award should be increased to account for

this.

752. Pursuant to Article 13(1) of the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 “benefits under
participation as well as the costs regarding the recruitment or disposal of that
participation (participation exemption) will not be included.”**’ A taxable entity
“participates” when, among other things, it is a shareholder of more than 5% of a

company’s shareholding.*°*

753. In the judgment of the Court of Gelderland, cited by the Claimants, it was held that
“Having regard to the term ‘benefits from the participation’ stated in Article 13(1) of
the CTA, it relates to benefits that are directly connected to the possession of shares.”®®

On that basis, the Court found that a payment under an award relating to a breach of an

agreement to transfer further shares in a company to a 30% shareholder of that company

was not subject to the participation exemption. This was because the payment did not

have a sufficient connection with the existing shareholding.

754. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the Gelderland decision can be

distinguished from the case at hand because the damages under the award related to a

867 Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act, Exhibit C-218.
868 Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act, Article 13(2), Exhibit C-218.

breach of contract to acquire shares rather than damages in relation to the possession of

shares.5”°

755. In the judgment of the Dutch Supreme Court, cited by the Claimants, it was ruled that a
compensation payment received by a party, who was a shareholder, was not covered by
the participation exemption because the compensation was for non-payment of the

purchase price under a contract to sell those shares.*7!

756. In the Tribunal’s view, the Supreme Court decision can also be distinguished from the
case at hand because the compensation related to a breach of contract to transfer shares
rather than compensation in relation to the possession of shares. This is supported by
the Supreme Court stating “Jf necessary, the interested party could have lowered the
value of the participation. The loss resulting therefrom is covered by the participation

872

exemption. Consequently, it appears possible that a loss in profits resulting from a

breach of treaty, would be covered by the participation exemption.

757. The Claimants’ counsel, at the hearing, noted that the “ultimate evidence will be a tax
ruling from the Dutch tax authorities [...] We don’t yet have the tax ruling; we have

applied to obtain it.”*”> Unfortunately, the Claimants have not adduced this evidence.

758. In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have failed to discharge the
evidentiary burden of a future obligation to pay tax in the Netherlands on compensation

received under this Award and consequently rejects this part of their claim.

759. As the Tribunal has found that the Claimants have failed to provide suffi
that they will have to pay tax on the amount awarded, the Tribunal need not, and does

not, consider the Respondent’s other defences.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

Costs

1. Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submitted their Submissions on Costs dated 30 November 2018 and

particulars of their claim for costs are as follows:

Legal Costs and Disbursements:
(a) Legal Fees: € 2.4 million
(b) Disbursement: € 102,789.46
(c) Translations: € 66,082.75

Experts’ Fees and Disbursements:
(a) Experts fees: € 466,272.19 which includes disbursements

Costs of Disbursement paid directly by Bridgepoint:
(a) € 5,670.10

The Claimants rely on Article 61 of the ICSID Convention in particular, Article 61(2)

which reads as follows:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection
with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses,
the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and charges for the
use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form
part of the award.

The Claimants also contend that the ECT is silent on how the Tribunal should allocate
costs but contend that the Tribunal has a broad discretion with regard to the allocation

of costs.
The Claimants contend that if they should succeed in this arbitration, that they are

entitled to costs on a full indemnity basis and therefore request the Tribunal to award

them costs in the total sum of €3,353,722.25.

2. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent informed the Tribunal on 30 October 2018 that it was unable to file its
Submissions on Costs pursuant to the Tribunal’s directions due to technology issues.
The Tribunal on 2 November 2018, extended the deadline to 30 November 2018. The
Respondent on 30 November 2018 requested a further extension because it was not able
to resolve its technology issues. The Tribunal on 3 December 2018, granted the
Respondent a further extension to file its Submissions on Costs until 2 January 2019.
The Respondent on 28 December 2018, requested a further extension to file its
Submissions on Costs and the Tribunal granted a further extension. The Respondent

submitted its Submission on Costs on 16 January 2019.

The Respondent’s claim for costs is as follows:

Costs paid to ICSID:
€ 462,023

Expert Report:
€ 462,687.41

Translations:

€ 32,704.35

Editing Services:

€ 70,832.15 (in Madrid-Spain)

The total costs claimed by the Respondent is € 1,555,976.10.

The Respondent takes the position that in the event the Kingdom of Spain succeeds, the

Claimants should pay the Respondent’s costs of € 1,555,976.10.

Tribunal’s Analysis on Costs

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides the Tribunal with a discretion to
allocate all costs of the arbitration including legal costs and other costs that have been
incurred by the parties as the Tribunal deems appropriate. The Tribunal refers to the

decision in LG&E*™ where the tribunal held as follows:

The Tribunal notes that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 28
of the ICSID Arbitration Rules grant discretion to ICSID tribunal with
regard to the award of costs.

The Respondent submitted two jurisdictional objections, one of which was rejected by
the Tribunal. The Claimants have prevailed on the principal issue with regard to
jurisdiction. The Claimants have also established a breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT.
The Claimants with regard to the issue of damages, have had their claim in damages
reduced for the reasons set out in the Tribunal’s analysis on damages. The Tribunal

does not accept all the items of the Claimants’ claim for costs.

The Tribunal is also of the view that the costs incurred by the parties in connection with
the arbitration, is reasonable bearing in mind the length of the arbitration, the

voluminous documentation and the comprehensive submissions in this matter.

The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):8”°

In the arbitration proceeding between

WATKINS HOLDINGS S.A R.L. & OTHERS

(Claimants)

THE KINGDOM OF SPAIN
(Respondent)

ICSID Case No. ARB/15/44

DISSENT ON LIABILITY AND QUANTUM
Prof. Dr. Héléne RUIZ FABRI

ne I support the conclusion that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over large parts of the claims
brought by Watkins Holdings S.a 1.1. & Others, including the dismissal of the Respondent’s intra-
EU jurisdictional objection (Award, paras. 142-226). I also agree that the Tribunal does not have
jurisdiction with respect to the Tax on the Value of the Production of Electrical Energy (TVPEE)

(Award, paras. 227-274).

2. However, with all due respect for my esteemed colleagues, I have to disagree with the
conclusion that the majority reached in the instant case on liability and quantum, concerning
mainly the meaning and functioning of the fair and equitable treatment standard (FET), on the

basis of the record before the Tribunal in this case.

3. This case is to be located in the broader context of a series of cases concerning a large
number of arbitrations conducted against Spain for its normative changes in the regulatory
framework of the renewable energy sector (sometimes named as the “Spanish saga”). In a situation
where many different cases stem from the same general measures and are conducted in parallel,
the clarity of the reasoning is especially important. I fear that the Tribunal in this award is far from

bringing the necessary clarity to the discussion.

4. More generally, the Tribunal does not justify sufficiently the reasoning that brings it to
reach its conclusion regarding FET. In my view, the judicial function of an international
investment tribunal entails a duty of legal reasoning that goes far beyond the exercise of qualifying
certain awards as convincing or discarding the reasons of others as non-satisfactory. The Tribunal
has to develop its own argumentation, answering carefully the arguments of the parties. Evidence
presented in the case must take precedence. In this regard, it might be noted that the Watkins case
is one of the very few, besides RREEF, which has to deal with the wind industry, whereas the vast
majority of the cases deal with solar (or PV or CSP) energy. And yet, the Watkins award fails to
point out whether this is a particularity to be taken into account or not, sometimes finding it is a
factor of distinguishing to discard the relevance of some other awards or, on the contrary, ignoring

it when espousing the findings of others.

5. The clarity of the reasoning is all the more crucial when fair and equitable treatment is at
stake: a fine-tuned balance should be found between the protection of the investment, especially
the legitimate expectations of the investor,' and the sovereign prerogatives of the State to legislate

for purposes in the general interest.

"As stated by the Tribunal in Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary, 1CSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Award of 25
November 2015, para. 7.75: “It is widely accepted that the most important function of the fair and equitable treatment
standard is the protection of the investor’s reasonable and legitimate expectations.”

 

“As firmly established in the case-law, an international obligation imposing on the State to
waive or decline to exercise its regulatory power cannot be presumed, given ‘the high
measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic
authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.’ The regulatory power is essential
to the achievement of the goals of the State, so to renounce to exercise it is an extraordinary
act that must emerge from an unequivocal commitment; more so when it faces a serious
crisis.”

6. In all the awards in the Spanish saga, investment tribunals have agreed on the existence of
some legitimate expectations on the side of the investor, the fundamental question being the extent
of those legitimate expectations in every single case. It is not questioned that the starting point is
the State’s right to regulate. Nor is it questioned that the role of the arbitrator is to determine what
the commitment, taken under the Energy Charter Treaty, to exercise this regulatory power within
certain limits means. The question is whether the State has overstepped the boundaries set by the

fair and equitable treatment obligation, inscribed in Article 10 of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT).

7. In its recent case Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile),
the ICJ dismissed Bolivia’s argument that the doctrine of “legitimate expectations” exists in
general international law outside the context of fair and equitable treatment clauses.* The doctrine
is at the heart of the functioning of the treaty standard. In this regard, I regret that the Tribunal did
not seize the opportunity to clearly rebut the attempt to read in Article 10(1) ECT an autonomous

standard of stability, existing alongside FET.

8. The protection granted by the FET standard is of variable intensity. Depending on the
existence of a stabilization clause or of specific commitments towards the investor (including
representations), the contours of the legitimate expectations will be different than in the case where
no such circumstances exist and the legitimate expectations stem from the general regulatory

framework of the State. In any event, since the inception of the doctrine of legitimate expectations

in the Tecmed Award,* the date of the investment and the standard of the reasonable investor have

always contributed to circumscribe its scope.

9. Generally, “the investor’s legitimate expectations are based on [the host state’s] legal
framework and on any undertakings and representations made explicitly or implicitly by the host
state”.° In the Spanish saga, different tribunals have reached different solutions concerning the
extent and morphology of the legitimate expectations. First, some tribunals have relied on the
existence of specific commitments equivalent to a stabilization clause in the favour of the investor
at hand. Second, other tribunals have found that individual representations of the State toward the
investor existed in the case at hand. Third, when no such specific commitments exist and in the
absence of individual representations, the question becomes whether the general regulation can
create legitimate expectations such that there will be no change of the normative framework. In
this case, the functioning of the FET standard requires balancing the regulatory margin of the State
with the legal security of investors, the assessment of such a balance being based on a
proportionality control. As recalled in Charanne, “in the absence of a specific commitment, an
investor cannot have a legitimate expectation that existing rules will not be modified”,® but the

State should not overstep the limits of the fair and equitable treatment.

10. Now, provided, arguendo, that we are in the first scenario and that, based on evidence on
record in the case, the Tribunal considered that there were such “firm undertakings” on the side of
the State, equivalent to a firm pledge of regulatory stabilization, | cannot adhere to the solution

reached by the Majority for two main reasons.

11. First, I cannot agree with the method used to justify the legal analysis of the qualification
of the obligation of stabilization allegedly created with Article 44(3) of the Royal Decree (RD)
661/2007 or the identification of specific commitments allegedly stemming from RD 661/2007.
This is because an in-depth analysis of Article 44(3) of the RD 661/2007 is missing, including
regarding its exact scope and the arguments raised in this regard by the Respondent, as summarised

in para. 407 of the Award. All the same, the Majority never demonstrated that Article 44(3) was

grandfathered and could not be repealed or replaced. And yet, there would not be so many different
approaches and divergences between tribunals of the Spanish saga if the legal qualification and

status of Article 44(3) could be treated so lightly.

12. Second, I cannot adhere to the solution reached by the Majority as it did not take into
sufficient consideration the date of the investment. The Tribunal did not consider how the date of
the investment would change the intensity of the legitimate expectations. Even admitting arguendo
that there was a stabilization commitment in 2007, can it be considered that the same commitment
still existed in 2011, where the stability became so uncertain that a “regulatory risk” became
plausible? The Tribunal in Watkins should have answered this question with the highest clarity,
explaining its positions concerning the “clear possibility of modification resulting from Articles 4
and 5 of RD 1614/2010”.”

13. Different arbitral tribunals have clearly done so. The tribunal in Cube has for instance
considered that there was in 2010 a “climate of change”, because of unambiguous signals that a

regulatory change of some sort was coming:

“330. The regulatory regime was largely the same as that applicable when the PV
investments were made, but with the important difference that the 2010-2011 regulatory
changes had by that time been adopted and with retroactive effect. The laws of 2010 and
2011 had demonstrated that the Respondent would at least adjust the periods for which
price incentives were payable and the levels of price incentives, if it considered this
necessary in order to address the tariff deficit.

333. In these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that any reasonable investor would
have taken a much more cautious view of the extent to which the continuation of the
existing legal regime could be relied on, but would not have had reason to expect the

complete abandonment of the Special Regime.”®

In Jsolux, the tribunal considered the fact that the Spanish Supreme Court has clearly stated in
2009 that there could be no guarantee that the regulatory regime was not going to change in the
near future,° and therefore drew the conclusion that an informed investor could not ignore this
wind of change.'° The tribunal in Novenergia confirmed this need of distinguishing based on the
date of the investment: “In Jsolux, again, as the Claimant rightly points out, the arbitral tribunal
was faced with an investor that had made investments in October of 2012, i.e. at a stage when it
must have been clear to the investor that changes were being made to the Special Regime.”'! And
yet, the Majority in Watkins fails to even analyse the issue of the date of the investment and its

eventual effect on the asserted legitimate expectations.

14. Further than that, the Tribunal proceeds to assess both the reasonableness and the
proportionality of the disputed measures without identifying the framework for this control.
Utmost clarity would have been necessary though, as the intensity of this control changes
depending on the scenario of the case (existence -or not- of specific commitments, or of firm
undertakings). Inasmuch as the core of the problem is whether the State has overstepped the
boundaries set by the FET standard, the Majority should have explained the method adopted to
operate the proportionality control. Notwithstanding what one may think about the proportionality
of the changes in the Spanish legal system, I cannot adhere to a reasoning that does not clearly set
the parameters of proportionality and does not follow them just as clearly, as what is at stake is the
balance between investment protection and the respect of the regulatory power of the State. And
yet, the Majority simply states abruptly that “changes to the FIT... [are] not an appropriate solution
to the problem” of tariff deficit, thus substituting its appreciation to Spain’s (at para. 601 of the

Award). Moreover, the Majority further asserts that there were “less intrusive means available”

expectation and non-retroactivity applied to the successive incentives’ regimes for electricity generation. This involves

alia, about the legal situation of the owners of electrical energy production installations under a special regime to
whom it is not possible to acknowledge for the future an "unmodifiable right " to the maintenance unchanged of the
remuneration framework approved by the holder of the regulatory authority provided that the stipulations of the Law
on the Electricity Sector are respected in terms of the reasonable return on investments.” (Respondent’s Exhibit R-
0002).

without verifying and justifying their effective accuracy and feasibility. I regret that no proper
exercise of weighing and balancing was conducted and that the context of the economic crisis was
not even acknowledged. Other awards have not hesitated to borrow from other courts or tribunals
which have developed a strong framework for proportionality control, be it the WTO Appellate
Body or the European Court of Human Rights.

15. Furthermore, concerning the impact of the proportionality control, provided arguendo that
State responsibility is the outcome of the proportionality test, I believe that the Majority should
have analysed clearly what was the impact of the “regulatory risk” existing at the date of the
investment on the amount of reparation. Provided, again arguendo, that the DCF method of
calculation was the most appropriate method (and some tribunals did not consider that that was
the case because of the particularities of the issue at stake), I cannot agree with the way in which
the Majority applied it, as the date of the investment and the surfacing of a regulatory risk had to
be taken into account even in this last phase of judicial reasoning, eventually adapting the amount

of damages (as the tribunal did for example in Cube).

16. Last but not least, contrary to what the Majority considered (at para. 593 (ii) of the Award),
the investment of the Claimants was not “destroyed”. The investment was bought at €91 million
in 2011, valued €98 million at the moment of the alleged intervention of the wrongful act in 2014
and sold at €133 million in 2016 (which meant a return of 11.2%). What is the Majority considering
as “destroyed” and what is the Tribunal repairing exactly, when awarding damages in the sum of
€77 million, without taking into account the date of the investment and the impact of the context

on reparation?
