INTRODUCTION

This arbitration concerns a dispute between ickale insaat Limited Sirketi (“igkale” or the
“Claimant”), a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Turkey, and
Turkmenistan (“Turkmenistan” or the “Respondent,” the Claimant and the Respondent

being hereafter collectively referred to as the “Parties”.

The dispute was submitted by the Claimant to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID" or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement between the
Republic of Turkey and Turkmenistan concerning the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection
of Investments dated 2 May 1992 (the “BIT,” the “Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT” or the
“Treaty’’) and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID

Convention”).

The dispute arises out of a series of thirteen construction contracts (the “Contracts”)
concluded by the Claimant with various Turkmen State organs and State entities during the
period from March 2007 to July 2008, and the alleged governmental interference with the

performance of the Contracts, in breach of the BIT.

The Claimant bases its claims on various measures taken by Turkmen State organs which,
inter alia, increased without compensation the Claimant’s scope of the works; abolished the
State Fund for the Development of the Oil and Gas Industry and Mineral Resources (the
“State Fund”) which was supposed to finance the works, resulting in substantial delays in
progress payments made under the Contracts; changed financial terms of the Contracts;
blocked bank accounts for non-payment of value-added tax; imposed unfair penalties;
terminated the still ongoing Contracts without valid justification; initiated judicial
proceedings without notice and participation, resulting in fines and confiscation of
machinery and equipment; refused to pay retention amounts; discriminated against the
Claimant in favor of Polimeks, another Turkish contractor which, like the Claimant, had
been awarded a contract for half of one of the projects; and encashed letters of guarantee

without justification.

The Claimant contends that Article VII(2) of the BIT provides it with the option to proceed
to international arbitration or to refer the dispute to the Turkmen courts, and that it has
chosen to exercise the option of international arbitration, invoking the State’s consent to
arbitrate disputes arising under the BIT. According to the Claimant, it made several
investments in Turkmenistan, including establishing a branch, bringing valuable know-how,
machinery and equipment to the construction projects, securing multi-million dollar letters
of guarantee, and executing the construction projects. The Claimant claims a total of over
USD 537 million and EUR 26.7 million in compensation for the loss and damage it allegedly
sustained as a result of the Respondent’s conduct. These amounts include the Claimant’s
claim for compensation for “consequential damages, loss of reputation, goodwill,

creditworthiness and business opportunities,” in the amount of USD 475.3 million.

The Respondent disputes the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the claims on several grounds,
including on the basis that the Claimant has failed to comply with the domestic litigation
requirement in Article VII(2) of the BIT prior to the submission of the claim to international
arbitration, that it has not made any investment in Turkmenistan within the meaning of the
ICSID Convention and the BIT, and that in any event its claims should be characterized as

contract claims rather than treaty claims.

The Respondent also denies that the Claimant’s claims have any merit. According to the
Respondent, this arbitration is merely an attempt by the Claimant to blame Turkmenistan
for its own failure to perform under the Contracts. The Respondent contends that the
Claimant did not have the managerial, technical, human and financial resources to execute
the significant works it had undertaken pursuant to the thirteen Contracts which it had
concluded, with one exception, over a short half-year period spanning from March to
November 2007, and which all provided for completion of the works in a period of two years

or less.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Claimant submitted its Request for Arbitration to the Centre on 10 November 2010.
After further correspondence between ICSID and the Parties, the Secretary-General of
ICSID (the “Secretary-General”) registered the Request for Arbitration on 20 December
2010, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.

By letter dated 24 February 2011, the Claimant informed the Secretary-General that the
Parties had been unable to reach an agreement on the method of constitution of the Arbitral
Tribunal and requested that the Tribunal be constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b)
of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, the Tribunal was to consist of three arbitrators, one
arbitrator appointed by each Party and the third, who would be President of the Tribunal,
appointed by agreement of the Parties. In the letter, Claimant informed the Centre that it

appointed Ms Carolyn B. Lamm, a national of the United States of America, as arbitrator.

On 10 March 2011, the Centre informed the Parties that Ms Lamm had accepted her

appointment and circulated her declaration and statement to the Parties.

By letter dated 22 March 2011, the Claimant requested that the Chairman of the
Administrative Council (the “Chairman”) appoint the arbitrators not yet appointed pursuant
to Rule 4 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID
Arbitration Rules”) and Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.

By letter of the same date, the Centre informed the Parties that the Chairman would use his
best efforts to comply with the Claimant’s request within 30 days of its receipt, in accordance
with Rule 4(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Article 38 of the ICSID Convention. The
Centre also informed the Parties that before the Chairman proceeded to make an
appointment, both Parties would be consulted as far as possible. The Parties were further
reminded that, until completion of the appointment process under Article 38 of the ICSID
Convention, it remained possible for the Respondent to appoint an arbitrator and for the
Parties to agree on a President of the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the

ICSID Convention.

20.

21.

By letter dated 23 March 2011, the Respondent informed the Centre that it appointed Mr
Fali S. Nariman, a national of India, as arbitrator in this case and proposed that the Parties
agree to discuss and appoint the President of the Tribunal by the agreement of the Parties

within 30 days from the Claimant’s acceptance of its proposal.

By another letter of the same date, the Respondent requested that Ms Lamm provide

additional information regarding her statement of 10 March 2011.

On 25 March 2011, the Centre informed the Parties that Mr Nariman had accepted his

appointment and circulated his declaration and personal profile.

On 28 March 2011, Ms Lamm furnished additional information in response to the

Respondent’s request of 23 March 2011.

By letter dated 29 March 2011, the Claimant reiterated its request that the Chairman appoint

an arbitrator to serve as the President of the Tribunal.

By letter dated 1 April 2011, the Respondent informed the Centre that it intended to propose,
upon the constitution of the Tribunal, the disqualification of Ms Lamm pursuant to Article

57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

By letter dated 11 April 2011, the Parties were invited to consider and agree on any of the
three proposed candidates to serve as the President of the Tribunal and provide their response

by completing a ballot form.

By letter dated 19 April 2011, upon receipt of the Parties’ ballot forms, the Centre informed
the Parties that there was no agreement between them on any of the candidates proposed by
the Centre for the appointment of the President of the Tribunal. The Centre further informed
the Parties that it would proceed with the appointment in accordance with Articles 38 and

40(1) of the ICSID Convention.

On 29 April 2011, the Centre indicated to the Parties its intention to propose to the Chairman
the appointment of Dr Veijo Heiskanen, a national of Finland, as the President of the
Tribunal, and that it would proceed with Dr Heiskanen’s appointment absent any compelling

objection from either Party by 6 May 2011.

By letter dated 11 May 2011, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that Dr Heiskanen
had accepted his appointment as the President of the Tribunal, and that pursuant to Rule 6
of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted, and the
proceedings to have begun, as of that date. Dr Heiskanen’s declaration was circulated to the
Parties with the letter. By the same letter, Mr Paul-Jean Le Cannu, ICSID Legal Counsel,

was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 22 July 2011, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties at the World Bank’s office
in Paris. At the session, the Parties confirmed, inter alia, that the Tribunal had been properly
constituted and the declarations of its Members had been distributed in accordance with the
ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Respondent stated that it would
not propose the disqualification of Ms Lamm. The final Minutes of the First Session were

circulated to the Parties on 8 August 2011.

In accordance with the Tribunal’s directions, the Respondent filed on 5 August 2011 a
request to bifurcate the proceedings to address its objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary

matter.

On 19 August 2011, the Claimant filed its observations on the Respondent’s request for

bifurcation.

By letter of 31 August 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to decline to
order bifurcation of the proceedings. The Tribunal also advised the Parties that a reasoned

decision would be circulated to them in due course.

On 9 September 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, which recorded its

reasoned decision on the Respondent’s request to bifurcate the proceedings.

On 1 November 2011, the President of the Tribunal circulated a statement to the Parties

concerning his appointment as arbitrator in another ICSID case.
On 1 March 2012, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits.

On 7 March 2012, Ms Lamm circulated a statement to the Parties concerning her law firm’s

involvement in other ICSID cases.

On 16 May 2012, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal suspend the current procedural
calendar in this arbitration and consider as a preliminary matter the issue of the meaning and
effect of Article VII(2) of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT. The Respondent’s request was
prompted by a decision rendered on 7 May 2012 by another ICSID tribunal in Kilig Insaat
Ithalat thracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi v. Turkmenistan (“Kilg Decision on
Article VII(2)”), in which the tribunal found that Article VII(2) of the Turkey-Turkmenistan
BIT requires an investor to first submit its claims to the courts of the host State, and to allow
a one-year period for the court to render its decision, before the investor can initiate
arbitration proceedings in one of the fora set out in Article VII(2) of the BIT, including

ICSID.!

By letter of 25 May 2012, the Claimant submitted comments on the Respondent’s

application of 16 May 2012, requesting that the Tribunal decline the Respondent’s requests.

On 28 June 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 in which it rejected
Respondent’s request of 16 May 2012. The Tribunal noted that while it was not persuaded
that addressing the meaning and effect of Article VII(2) of the BIT as a preliminary matter
would serve the interests of due process or procedural efficiency, it recognized the
importance of the issue and directed the Parties to address “all aspects of the issue” in their

upcoming memorials, including in particular the following:

‘a. the various language versions of the BIT, including the existence of a Turkmen
version of the BIT;

b. the authenticity of the various language versions of the BIT;

c. the accuracy of the English translations of each of the authentic versions of the
BIT;

d. the negotiating history of the BIT, including travaux préparatoires, if any; the
Parties are invited to produce witness testimony as appropriate;

e. the rules of treaty interpretation applicable to the BIT, including the issue of
whether the fact that the treaty creates rights for third party beneficiaries (private
investors) affects in any way the interpretation of the treaty; and

f whether the objection put forward by Respondent on the basis of its interpretation
of Article VIK(2) of the BIT raises an issue of jurisdiction or an issue of
admissibility.”

On 3 November 2012, the Respondent filed its Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-

Memorial on the Merits.

On 18 December 2012, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to express concerns arising
out of views expressed in an amicus brief filed before the United States Supreme Court in
BG Group PLC v. The Republic of Argentina and to which Ms Lamm had subscribed. The
Respondent indicated that it would welcome Ms Lamm’s response to the letter. By letter of
21 December 2012, Ms Lamm submitted comments on the concerns expressed by the
Respondent in its letter of 18 December 2012. By letter of 9 January 2013, the Respondent
submitted comments on Ms Lamm’s letter of 21 December 2012. The Respondent stated,

inter alia, that:

“At this time, however, in reliance upon Ms. Lamm’s assurances, Respondent seeks
no further action from the Tribunal with regard to Ms. Lamm’s continued
participation as an arbitrator. Turkmenistan reserves all of its rights, remedies,
defenses and objections in regard to this Arbitration, including with respect to the
matters raised in its letter of December 18, 2012.”

 

On 7 February 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 in which it decided on the

Parties’ document requests as set out in the Redfern Schedules filed on 23 January 2013.7

On 22 April 2013, the Claimant filed a Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on

Jurisdiction.
On 15 July 2013, the Respondent filed its Reply Memorial on Its Objections to Jurisdiction.
On 29 July 2013, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on the Merits.

By letter of 15 August 2013, Counsel for the Respondent informed the Tribunal that they
had been “in discussions with [their] client regarding the financial arrangements for the

proceedings in this and other pending cases and [that they were] still awaiting decisions in

that regard.” Counsel stated that “under the circumstances, [they would] not be able to
proceed with the hearing on the dates presently scheduled” and requested a postponement

of the hearing, which had been scheduled to take place from 7 through 18 October 2013.

By letter of 19 August 2013, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to further elaborate on the
basis of its request by 20 August 2013. In particular, the Respondent was requested to
elaborate on the “financial arrangements” that it invoked in support of its request. The
Claimant was invited to comment on the Respondent’s further and more detailed request by

22 August 2013.
On 19 August 2013, the Claimant filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.

By letter of 20 August 2013, the Respondent provided further information on the basis of its
request for postponement of the hearing. By letter of 21 August 2013, the Claimant
submitted comments on the Respondent’s request. The Claimant requested that the Tribunal
“(i) apply the relevant rules of Article 42 of the Arbitration Rules, (ii) notify Respondent of
its default and Claimant's request on the continuance of the proceedings, [and] (iii) ask
Respondent to determine its final position on the continuance of the proceedings and to

suggest a new date for the hearings by 2 September 2013.”

By letter of 23 August 2013, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimant’s request,

arguing that it should be denied.

On 26 August 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 in which it noted that the
situation did not fall within ICSID Arbitration Rule 42 and decided inter alia to grant the
Respondent’s request that the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits scheduled to be held in
October 2013 be postponed to a later date. The Tribunal requested that the Respondent
confirm, by 25 September 2013, that the financial issues that it was currently facing were
resolved, and that it intended to participate in the proceedings, including the hearing, and to

discharge its financial obligations.

By letter of 30 August 2013, the Tribunal proposed new hearing dates. By letter of 4

September 2013, the Claimant submitted comments on the Tribunal’s proposed hearing

47.

49.

dates and requested earlier dates for the hearing. By letter of 9 September 2013, the Tribunal

proposed additional hearing dates.

By letter of 25 September 2013, the Respondent confirmed its intention to participate in the
proceedings and in the hearing and to discharge the financial obligations connected
therewith. The Respondent confirmed that it would confer with counsel for the Claimant

with respect to the new hearing dates proposed by the Tribunal.

In a further exchange of correspondence on 30 August, 9 and 25 September, and 4 and 9
October 2013, the Parties and the Tribunal agreed to hold the hearing from 12 to 23 May
2014 in Paris.

On 14 January 2014, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal “to seek [its] advice regarding the
need to make available to Respondent certain potentially voluminous documentation related
to the 13 construction projects at issue in this arbitration [the so-called “Vouched
Documents”].” On 27 January 2014, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimant’s
letter of 14 January 2014. By letter of 29 January 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties
that, in the absence of a formal request for a ruling, it had taken note of the Claimant’s letter
and determined that no decision was required in the matter. By letter of 2 February 2014,
the Claimant submitted clarifications as to the nature of the advice it was seeking from the
Tribunal. By email of 4 February 2014, the Tribunal took note of the Claimant’s letter. By
letter of the same date, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal issue a ruling precluding
the Claimant from producing the “Vouched Documents” or any other documents at such an
allegedly late stage. Alternatively, the Respondent requested a ruling (i) affording the
Respondent adequate time and opportunity to review the newly submitted evidence and to
respond in a written submission; (ii) adjourning the hearing; and (iii) ordering the Claimant
to pay the costs incurred by the Respondent in undertaking this additional round of document
review and filing. By letter of 5 February 2014, the Claimant asked that the Tribunal reject
the Respondent’s requests of 4 February 2014. By letter of 14 February 2014, the Tribunal

informed the Parties that:

“[...] the issue concerns the production of documents between the Parties, and that
neither Party has yet offered to produce them as evidence in these proceedings. In
these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it is not in a position to preclude

50.

51.

52.

53.

54.

55.

the Claimant from offering the documents to the Respondent for review if it so
wishes; however, it will be similarly for the Respondent to decide whether it wishes
to review or indeed receive them.

The Tribunal’s ruling is without prejudice to its decision as to the legal
consequences, if any, of the Claimant’s failure to produce the documents earlier
and/or the Respondent's decision as to how it chooses to deal with the documents.
The Tribunal will take a view on these issues, as appropriate, if either Party offers
to produce any of the documents in question as evidence at a later stage of the
arbitration.”

By letter dated 4 March 2014, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that Mr James

Claxton, ICSID Legal Counsel, would replace Mr Le Cannu as Secretary of the Tribunal.

By letter of 12 March 2014, the Respondent requested a ruling precluding the Claimant from
introducing documents produced on 28 February 2014 into evidence or, in the alternative,
bifurcating the proceedings so that only the jurisdictional objections would be heard at the

May 2014 hearing.

By letter of 17 March 2014, the Claimant objected to the Respondent’s proposals in its letter
of 12 March 2014. The Claimant proposed that the hearing proceed as planned. As to the
documents produced on 28 February 2014, the Claimant proposed that the Respondent have
the option of filing a post-hearing brief addressing its issues with the documents to be

followed by a reply by the Claimant and a hearing if the Tribunal considered it advisable.

By letter of 17 March 2014, the Respondent rejected the Claimant’s proposals in its letter of

17 March 2014 and repeated its request for bifurcation of the proceedings.

By letter of 18 March 2014, the Claimant commented on the Respondent’s letter of 17 March
2014 and proposed that the proceedings be bifurcated so that jurisdictional objections and
liability would be heard at the May 2014 hearing, whereas quantum would he heard at a later

hearing. The Respondent accepted this proposal by email of the same day.

By letter of 20 March 2014, the Tribunal noted the agreement of the Parties that
jurisdictional objections and liability would be heard at the May 2014 hearing, whereas
quantum would be heard at a later hearing. The Tribunal invited the Parties to attempt to

reach agreement about the date and length of the hearing on quantum.

By letter dated 26 March 2014, the Centre informed the Parties that Mr Nariman would not
be able to attend in person the hearing scheduled to be held from 14 through 24 May 2014
due to a serious illness in his immediate family, and that the Centre was in the process of
making arrangements for Mr Nariman to join the scheduled hearing by videoconference,

subject to any comments from the Parties.

By letter dated 27 March 2014, the Respondent objected to the Centre’s proposed
arrangements to conduct the scheduled hearing with Mr Nariman attending by
videoconference. By letter dated 28 March 2014, the Claimant indicated that it consented

to the proposed arrangements, but objected to any further postponement of the hearing.

By letter dated 2 April 2014, the Centre informed the Parties that Mr Nariman had resigned
from his appointment as arbitrator in this case due to his wife’s ill-health and his inability to
travel abroad as a result. The Centre further informed the Parties that Dr Heiskanen and Ms
Lamm had consented to Mr Nariman’s resignation, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 8(2),
and that the proceeding would remain suspended until the vacancy created by the resignation
had been filled pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2). The Respondent was invited to

promptly appoint a new arbitrator.

On 28 April 2014, the Respondent informed the Secretary-General that it appointed
Professor Philippe Sands QC, a national of the United Kingdom and France, to replace

Mr Nariman.

By letter dated 30 April 2014, the Claimant requested that Professor Sands decline to accept
his appointment, on the basis that Professor Sands had previously been appointed by
Turkmenistan to serve on the tribunal in the Kili¢ Insaat Ithalat Ihracat Sanayi ve Ticaret
Anonim Sirketi v. Turkmenistan case (“Kilig”), which had issued two decisions on the
interpretation of Article VII(2) of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT, the same provision the
interpretation of which was also at issue in this case.*> By letter of the same date, the

Respondent provided observations on the Claimant’s request.

On 12 May 2014, the Centre informed the Parties that Professor Sands had accepted his
appointment and circulated copies of Professor Sands’ declaration, statement and
curriculum vitae pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2). The Centre confirmed that the
vacancy created in the Tribunal following the resignation of Mr Nariman on 2 April 2014
had thus been filled, and the Tribunal was reconstituted. In accordance with ICSID
Arbitration Rule 12, the proceeding resumed on that date from the point it had reached at

the time the vacancy occurred.

On 16 May 2014, the Claimant filed a proposal for disqualification of Professor Sands. The

proceeding was suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).

By letter of 17 May 2014, the Respondent filed a proposal for disqualification of Ms Lamm
and communicated its understanding that the disqualification proposal of Professor Sands
and the disqualification proposal of Ms Lamm would be decided by the Chairman in

accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention.

By letter of 19 May 2014, the Secretariat invited the Parties to agree to treat the
disqualification proposal of Professor Sands and the disqualification proposal of Ms Lamm
as a single proposal to disqualify the majority of the Tribunal, which would be decided by

the Chairman in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention.

By email of 20 May 2014, the Claimant informed the Secretariat that it did not agree to treat
the disqualification proposal of Professor Sands and the disqualification proposal of Ms
Lamm as a single proposal to disqualify the majority of the Tribunal. The Secretariat
accordingly communicated to the Parties that Dr Heiskanen and Ms Lamm would decide the
proposal for the disqualification of Professor Sands under Article 58 of the ICSID

Convention and Arbitration Rule 9(2).

By letter dated 22 May 2014, the Secretariat communicated to the Parties on behalf of Dr
Heiskanen and Ms Lamm the schedule for written submissions on the Claimant’s proposal

to disqualify Professor Sands.

By email of 23 May 2014, the Parties requested changes to the schedule of written
submissions. The Secretariat confirmed the agreement of Dr Heiskanen and Ms Lamm to

the changes to the schedule by email of the same day.

On 2 June 2014, the Respondent filed its observations on the Claimant’s proposal for the

disqualification of Professor Sands.

By letter dated 4 June 2014, Professor Sands provided a statement on the proposal for his

disqualification pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3).

On 11 June 2014, the Claimant filed its observations on its proposal for the disqualification
of Professor Sands. By letter of the same date, the Respondent confirmed that it had no

further comment on the proposal.

On 11 July 2014, Dr Heiskanen and Ms Lamm rendered their decision declining the

Claimant’s proposal. The proceeding was resumed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 9(6).

Following exchanges of correspondence between the Parties, the Tribunal informed the
Parties on 21 July 2014 that the hearing would be held from 9-20 March 2015 and that it
intended to hear evidence relating to all aspects of the case, including jurisdiction, liability,

and quantum.

A pre-hearing organizational meeting took place by telephone conference on 21 January

2015.

By letter dated 29 January 2015, the Tribunal circulated a summary of the items agreed
during the pre-hearing organizational meeting, as well as directions from the Tribunal on
items that were not agreed by the Parties. In the letter, the Tribunal confirmed inter alia that

there would be post-hearing briefs.

A hearing on jurisdiction and the merits took place at the World Bank’s office in Paris from
9 to 20 March 2015 (the “Hearing”). In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the

Secretary of the Tribunal, present at the Hearing were:

On the last day of the Hearing, the Tribunal communicated to the Parties a number of issues
that it had identified in the course of the arbitration, and invited the Parties to address these
issues in their post-hearing briefs. The Tribunal also invited the Parties to confirm their
agreement on the number of rounds of post-hearing submissions. The Claimant stated that
subject to further internal consultation it would prefer to have one round of post-hearing

briefs, whereas the Respondent indicated that it preferred to have two rounds.

By letter of 22 March 2015, the Secretariat communicated to the Parties, on behalf of the
Tribunal, a summary of the outstanding issues and agreements reached at the Hearing. The
Tribunal directed the Claimant to circulate a list of exhibit numbers that corresponded to the
videos relied on at the Hearing for which transcripts were provided, invited the Respondent
to comment on the transcripts of the videos by 3 April 2015, and indicated that the Claimant
may produce evidence in response to the Respondent’s exhibits filed as R-554 and R-555 at
the Hearing by the same date. By the same letter, the Claimant was invited to indicate by
27 March 2015 whether it wished to have a second round of post-hearing briefs, and the
Parties were directed to file, pursuant to their agreement, statements of costs (i.e., a list of

costs without legal argument) by 19 June 2015.

By letter dated 25 March 2015, the Claimant provided information concerning exhibit

numbers corresponding to the videos shown at the Hearing.

By letter dated 27 March 2015, the Claimant indicated that a second round of post-hearing
briefs would be unnecessary and proposed that the final submission deal with the Parties’

statements of cost only.

By email dated 1 April 2015, the Respondent requested that two rounds of post-hearing
briefs be scheduled.

By email dated 2 April 2015, the Tribunal decided that one round of post-hearing briefs
would be sufficient, but indicated that it remained open “to grant, upon a reasoned request
by either Party, an opportunity for such Party to comment on a specific point raised in the

other Party’s post-hearing submission.”

By email dated 2 April 2015, the Respondent requested that the “Claimant provide (i) the
raw footage from which the various excerpts of videos submitted by Claimant were taken;
(ii) separate transcripts for each video excerpt submitted into the record as an exhibit by
Claimant; and (iii) source information for the videos, including the website address from
which Claimant obtained them and the date on which it was accessed.” The Respondent

also reiterated its request that “the 3 April deadline for a separate submission on this matter

16

84.

85.

86.

87.

either be extended or dispensed with, in which case the Respondent will include all of its

comments about the videos and Claimant’s submissions in the post-hearing brief.”

By a separate email dated 2 April 2015, the Respondent provided a point of clarification

regarding its earlier request of the same date.

By email dated 3 April 2015, the Tribunal provided its ruling on the Respondent’s request
of April 2, 2015 as follows:

“(1) The Claimant is requested to produce, to the Respondent only, the raw video
footage from which the various excerpts of videos submitted by the Claimant were
taken, by 10 April 2015;

(2) The Claimant is requested to produce, by the same date, separate transcripts
for each video that is already on record as an exhibit, together with the source
information (including the website address from which the videos were obtained)
and the date of access for such videos; and

(3) The Respondent is invited to make any comments it may wish to make on the
materials produced within a week of their delivery, and to produce its version of the
transcript if it so wishes.”

In accordance with the Tribunal’s direction of 22 March 2015, the Claimant produced
evidence (Exhibits C-221 through C-227) on 3 April 2015 in response to the Respondent’s
exhibits filed as R-554 and R-555 at the Hearing (renumbered by the Respondent as Exhibits
R-569 and R-570 due to a numbering error). The Claimant further requested from the
Tribunal an order for the Respondent to produce certain documents as specified in paragraph
9 of the Claimant’s submission of 3 April 2015, and reserved its rights to comment on
Exhibits R-569 and R-570, and the Respondent’s contentions about them, in its post-hearing
brief.

In accordance with the Tribunal’s direction of 3 April 2015, the Claimant produced raw
video footage to the Respondent via ICSID’s BOX server and separate transcripts for the
video footages (Exhibits C-106, C-112, C-115, C-118, C-119, C-126, C-127, C-130, C-136,
C-149, C-150, C-151, C-156, C-161, C-170, C-172, C-174, submitted with the Claimant’s

Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 22 April 2013), together

with the source information, on 10 April 2015.

By letter dated 14 April 2015, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimant’s

submission of 3 April 2015.

By email of 17 April 2015, the Respondent requested an extension to submit its comments

on the Claimant’s submissions of 10 April 2015.

By email of the same date, the Claimant provided its comments on the Respondent’s request

for an extension.

By email dated 20 April 2015, the Tribunal ruled on the Claimant’s request that the Tribunal
order the Respondent to produce certain documents as specified in paragraph 9 of its

submission of 3 April 2015 as follows:

“I. The Claimant’s request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to
produce the Annex, referred to at p. 1 of “Report No. 259” (Exhibit C-
224), is denied; and

2. The Respondent is ordered to produce the complete tender
documentation package for the ten of the thirteen contracts at issue in
this case for which such documentation is available as soon as possible
but not later than Thursday, 23 April 2015.”

By the same email, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit its comments on the
Claimant’s submissions of 10 April 2015 as soon as possible but no later than Wednesday,
22 April 2015. The Tribunal also invited the Parties to confer on whether the deadline for

the post-hearing briefs should be extended, and to inform the Tribunal of any agreement

reached by Monday, 27 April 2015.

By letter dated 22 April 2015, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Claimant’s

submissions of 10 April 2015.

In accordance with the Tribunal’s ruling of 20 April 2015, the Respondent produced the
tender documentation package for ten of the thirteen contracts at issue in this case (Exhibits

R-571 through R-577) on 23 April 2015.

By email dated 27 April 2015, the Claimant indicated that the Parties had reached an
agreement to extend the deadline for the post-hearing briefs by two weeks, until 29 May

2015.

By letter of the same date, the Claimant provided its observations on the Respondent’s

submission of 23 April 2015.
By letter of 30 April 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties and the
Tribunal that Mr Paul Jean Le Cannu would replace Mr James Claxton as Secretary of the

Tribunal as of that date.

On 18 May 2015, the Claimant requested, on behalf of both Parties, that the deadline for the
submission of post-hearing briefs be extended until 5 June 2015, in view of the time required

to make corrections to the hearing transcript.

On 20 May 2015, the Parties were advised that the Tribunal had agreed to the requested

extension of time, but that it did not envisage granting any further extensions.

The Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs on 5 June 2015.

On 25 June 2015, the Respondent submitted a reasoned request for an opportunity to

comment on the Claimant’s post-hearing brief.

On 26 June 2015, the Parties filed their statements on cost.

On 30 June 2015, the Claimant submitted its comments on the Respondent’s request of 25

June 2015.

On 2 July 2015, the Respondent submitted further comments in support of its request of 25
June 2015. By separate letter of the same day, the Respondent objected to the Claimant’s
cost submission of 26 June 2015, arguing that contrary to the Tribunal’s directions, the

submission contained legal argument, which should be disregarded.

On 6 July 2015, the Tribunal communicated its decision that the Claimant’s cost submission
would be disregarded insofar as it contained legal argument, contrary to the agreement
reached by the Parties at the Hearing and communicated by the Tribunal to the Parties on 22
March 2015. The ruling also applied to the Respondent’s letter of 2 July 2015, insofar as it

sought to reply to the Claimant’s legal argument.

On 7 July 2015, the Tribunal issued its rulings on the remaining issues in dispute, dismissing
in part and granting in part the Respondent’s request for an opportunity to comment on the

Claimant’s post-hearing brief.

On 14 July 2015, the Respondent submitted its comments on the issues identified in the

Tribunal’s ruling of 7 July 2015.

On 22 July 2015, the Respondent requested leave to submit the decision of the ad hoc
annulment committee in Kilig (the “Kilig Annulment Decision”), which had been rendered
on 14 July 2015.4 The Respondent indicated that it would be prepared to file a short

submission on the decision if the Tribunal would find it helpful.

On 27 July 2015, the Claimant indicated that it had no objection to including the decision of
the ad hoc annulment committee into the record. The Claimant also stated that in its view

the Tribunal need not receive comments from either Party on the decision.

By letter of 4 January 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided to admit

the Kilig Annulment Decision into the record, but did not find it necessary to seek further

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ CONTENTIONS

This section sets out a summary of the Parties’ contentions on the facts and their requests
for relief, as pleaded in the course of the proceedings. The Tribunal’s findings on the
relevant facts, including disputed facts, are set out in the context of its decisions on the
relevant issues in Sections 7 to 8 below. The Parties’ positions and the Tribunal’s
determination on jurisdictional and other preliminary issues are set out in Section 4 to 6

below.

The Claimant’s case
3.1.1. The Claimant’s contentions

The Claimant is a limited liability company incorporated in 1982 under the laws of the
Republic of Turkey. Its main activity is the design, development and implementation of real
estate development and infrastructure projects commissioned by both private and public
sector entities. The projects carried out by the Claimant include dam projects, drinking water

conveyance and sewage system projects, and hotel and residential building projects.

The Claimant’s first project outside Turkey was in Turkmenistan, where it opened a branch
office in 2004. During the period from 2004 to 2009, the Claimant concluded a total of
fifteen contracts for various projects in Turkmenistan, of which the thirteen set out in the
table below, with a total value of approximately USD 250 million, are at issue in the present
arbitration (defined above as the “Contracts” or, when referring to the works, the
“Projects”). These Contracts related to a number of public construction projects, which
formed part of a plan by the President of Turkmenistan to develop Turkmenistan’s
infrastructure, including to promote tourism, with the aim of bringing the country into a

“golden age.”

The Claimant concluded the Contracts with various Contracting Parties of which three were
State organs, namely the Governorship of Lebap Province, the Governorship of Ahal
Province, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The other Contracting Parties, namely
the State-Owned Enterprise “Turkmenneftegazstroy,” the State Commercial Bank
“Dayhanbank,” and the Turkmenbashi Oil Processing Complex, are, according to the
Claimant, entities which are under the control of the Respondent. The Claimant alleges in
particular that these Contracting Parties are owned entirely by the Respondent, that their
directors are appointed by the President of Turkmenistan, that they must seek the
authorization of the Respondent to take actions such as terminating or amending contracts,
that their chairmen are personally responsible to the President, and that they acted under the

direct instructions of State organs when amending the Contracts or applying delay penalties.

The Contracts were awarded to the Claimant on the basis of Presidential Decrees which form
the legal basis for the Claimant’s investments in Turkmenistan, and which set out the main
terms and conditions of the Contracts, such as their value, duration, and the entities
responsible for financing and implementing the Contracts. The Presidential Decrees

awarding ten of the Claimant’s thirteen Contracts, as well as the Contracts themselves,

23

116.

117.

118.

provided in particular that payments would be financed by the State Fund, which was funded
by the State’s oil and gas revenues. The Claimant argues that it considered the State Fund
as an important insurance on which it relied in expanding its operations in Turkmenistan.
The State Fund was, however, abolished in 2008, shortly after Gurbanguly
Berdimuhamedov, the second post-independence President of Turkmenistan, came into

power.

The Claimant alleges that it completed its works under six of the Contracts, as well as a
portion of an additional contract relating to several projects, with a combined value of
approximately USD 150 million. The Contracts which the Claimant alleges it completed
are the Avaza Hotel Contract, the Ashgabat Kindergarten Contract, the Ruhiyet Mansion
Contract, the Ministry of Economy Contract, the Kipchak School Contract, the Kipchak
Hotel Contract, and the portion of the Babarap Projects Contract relating to the construction
of a school. It further argues that, due to the actions and omissions of the Respondent, it
was unable to complete the remaining six Contracts, namely the Dayhanbank Contract, the
Kipchak Cultural Center Contract, the Abadan School Contract, the Abadan Kindergarten
Contract, the Ashgabat Cinema Contract, the Avaza Canal Contract, and the remaining

portions of the Babarap Projects Contract.

According to the Claimant, the organs of the Respondent, including the President of
Turkmenistan, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Supreme Chamber of Control, and the Central
Bank, repeatedly intervened in the Projects, preventing it from completing the works under
several of the Contracts, and causing significant damage to the Claimant. As a result of the
Respondent’s actions and omissions, the Claimant alleges that it is no longer a viable
construction company, as it is unable to obtain the credit and bank guarantees which it needs

to conduct its business.

The Claimant alleges in particular that the President of Turkmenistan personally supervised,
and interfered directly in, the Projects, for instance by issuing instructions not to respect the
terms of the Claimant’s Contracts and not to make payments, and by arbitrarily setting

completion dates. According to the Claimant, the Contracting Parties were merely an

24

119.

120.

121.

122.

123.

appendage of the President, which the President controlled through threats and intimidation

of his subordinates.

The Claimant complains in this arbitration of a wide-range of actions and omissions of the

Respondent, which are summarized in turn below.

First, the Claimant argues that the Respondent, through the Central Office of State Expert
Review (the “State Expert Review”), increased the scope of the works to be performed by
the Claimant under many of the Contracts by 7% to 68%, purportedly in order to ensure

compliance with Turkmen construction laws and regulations.

The Claimant alleges that the technical specifications for the design and construction of the
Projects, which were part of the tender documentation, set out the total construction area in
square meters of each of the Projects, and were reviewed by the Ministry of Construction
and Materials Industry of Turkmenistan (the “Ministry of Construction”) prior to being
issued. The Ministry of Construction further reviewed the Contracts, which also indicate
the total surface area of the works, before they were signed, as did other organs of the

Respondent.

However, after the Contracts were signed and the Claimant had received the advance
payments, purchased materials and equipment, and mobilized personnel, the State Expert
Review, which had to approve the Claimant’s draft technical drawings, required significant
increases in the total construction area in respect of ten of the Contracts, purportedly to
comply with applicable norms and regulations. For instance, the Avaza Hotel Contract
provided for an area of 19,440 m, but the total area of the final drawings after
implementation of the State Expert Review’s comments was 16% higher, namely

22,558 m2.
The Claimant alleges that it received assurances from the Contracting Parties and the

Council of Ministers that it would be paid for the additional work imposed by the State

Expert Review. However, the President ultimately refused to provide additional

25

124.

125.

126.

compensation, and the Contracting Parties subsequently threatened to unilaterally lower the

contract prices if the Claimant continued to pursue the issue.

Second, the Claimant argues that the Respondent delayed progress payments under the
Contracts, in particular following the abolition of the State Fund by the new President in
2008. It argues that progress payments under the Contracts stopped being paid on time as
of mid-2007, shortly after President Berdimuhamedov came to power. However, the
problem allegedly became more serious after the State Fund was abolished. The Claimant
contends that pursuant to the Procedure for the Use of Financial Resources annexed to
Presidential Decree No. 9477, under which the State Fund was abolished, all further
payments under the Contracts were subject to the approval of the President and of the
Cabinet of Ministers. It alleges that as of the abolition of the State Fund, the Respondent
began intervening directly in the payments made to the Claimant, delaying and even
blocking payments under ten of its Contracts. It contends, for instance, that under the
Kipchak Cultural Centre Contract, several progress payments were made between 32 and
114 days late, and that no payment was made at all in respect of one of its Certificates of
Work Performance. Similarly, as of October 2008, the Respondent made payments under
certificates of work performance issued under the Avaza Canal Contract between 41 and
106 days late, and did not make any payments at all in respect of two such certificates. As
a result of the delays and non-payment, the Claimant alleges that, by the end of the third

quarter of 2008, it was financing the construction Projects entirely on its own.

The Claimant further contends that it continued working on the Avaza Canal Project for
seven months without payment, on the basis of verbal representations from the Cabinet of
Ministers that the President would allocate USD 400 million to the Avaza projects.

However, it ultimately never received payment for some of the works.

Third, the Claimant argues that in respect of the seven Projects it completed, the Respondent
prevented the completion of the contractual handover procedure, allegedly in order to
prevent the payment of the 5% retention amounts which the Claimant was owed under the

Contract at the end of the warranty maintenance period.

26

127.

128.

129.

130.

The Claimant contends in particular that the Respondent began operating the facilities it had
completed even though no handover certificates had been signed. In accordance with the
Contracts, the handover certificates were to be signed by the State Acceptance Committees,
which were composed of representatives of various public agencies as well as
representatives of the Contracting Parties. While the representatives of the Contracting

Parties on the State Acceptance Committees generally signed the handover certificates, other

 

officials, including from the Ministry of Construction, did not, preventing them from being

issued, and blocking the payment of the 5% retention amounts.

The Claimant contends that the President of Turkmenistan himself ordered that the 5%
retention amounts should not be paid, and threatened to imprison his subordinates if they
took any actions leading to such payments. The Claimant further contests the Respondent’s
contentions that handover certificates were not issued due to defects in the Claimant’s works,
or to the Claimant’s failure to submit the necessary documents. For instance, it argues that
the subcontract and progress reports on which the Respondent relies to argue that it had to
retain a subcontractor to complete unfinished works on the Avaza Hotel Project are
fabricated. The Claimant further contends that the fact that the facilities were operated by
the Respondent demonstrates that the Respondent’s allegations are not credible, and that any
defects that were identified on certain Projects, such as the Kipchak School and Babarap

School Projects, were cured.

Fourth, the Claimant contends that the Respondent unfairly imposed delay penalties under
six of the Contracts, even though delays in the Projects were almost exclusively attributable

to the Respondent.

The Respondent allegedly caused delays by imposing a significant increase in the scope of
the Claimant’s works, by making progress payments late or not at all, and through failures
by its authorities to register some of the Contracts in a timely manner, which prevented the
Claimant from beginning the execution of certain Projects for several months. These delays
were not, however, taken into account by the Respondent in imposing delay penalties against

the Claimant.

27

131.

132.

133.

According to the Claimant, the President of Turkmenistan set arbitrary completion dates for
the Projects and instructed the Supreme Chamber of Control to conduct a review of whether
or not to grant time extensions on more than a hundred ongoing construction projects. On
the basis of the Supreme Chamber of Control’s one-day review, the Claimant was then
forced, pursuant to the instructions of the Council of Ministers, to conclude with the relevant
Contracting Parties addenda to several of its Contracts, which, although they granted
extensions for its works, provided that it would not be released from paying delay penalties.
It also contends that it was forced to sign certificates in which it recognized its liability for

delay penalties.

The Claimant alleges that it was forced to sign these documents in order to avoid the
termination by the Respondent of its Contracts, to ensure payment for the works it had
performed and to avoid serious repercussions such as those endured by other investors who
had sought to contest acts of the Turkmen State before the Turkmen courts, including

imprisonment of company officers.

The Claimant further argues that delay penalties were unjustly imposed against it under
some of its Contracts by the Arbitration Court of Turkmenistan (the “Arbitration Court”
or the “TAC”) in proceedings that had been initiated by the General Prosecutor of
Turkmenistan, allegedly on the instructions of the President. It contends that it was not
notified of, or represented in, the proceedings, and that the Arbitration Court disregarded its
entitlement to an extension of time for its works as a result of delays caused by the
Respondent, in particular the Respondent’s delays in making progress payments. It further
argues that, in respect of some Contracts, for instance the Babarap Projects Contract and the
Avaza Canal Contract, the Arbitration Court imposed delay penalties even though the
Contracts had been terminated prior to their original completion dates. In the proceedings
concerning the Kipchak Cultural Center Contract, the Arbitration Court also allegedly failed
to take into account its own decision as to the termination of the Contract, and the
Contracting Party’s own admission that the Claimant had completed 40% of the works but

only received payment for 17% of the works.

28

134.

135.

136.

137.

138.

On the basis of its orders that the Claimant pay delay penalties, the Arbitration Court also
ordered the attachment and sale of part of the Claimant’s machinery and equipment in
Turkmenistan. For instance, in March 2010, the Arbitration Court issued a decision
enforcing a previous decision imposing delay penalties on the Claimant under the Avaza
Canal Contract, on the basis of which 23 items of its machinery and equipment were attached

and sold.

Fifth, the Claimant argues that the Respondent unfairly terminated seven of the Claimant’s

Contracts.

The Claimant contends that the termination of its Contracts was subject to a three-step
procedure, according to which the Contracting Party first sent a notice of termination to the
Claimant while requesting authorization from the Cabinet of Ministers. Upon receiving the
authorization, the Contracting Party then applied to the TAC for a termination order, and
finally a Presidential Decree was issued. The Claimant alleges that the actions of both the
Contracting Parties, acting with the approval of the Cabinet of the Ministers, and of the TAC

in terminating its seven Contracts, were in bad faith.

In particular, the Claimant alleges that the relevant Contracting Parties, with the approval of
the Cabinet of Ministers, initiated the termination of the Claimant’s seven outstanding
Contracts within a one-month period starting in August 2009. In doing so, they failed to
take into account the various delays caused by the Respondent, as a result of which the
Claimant was entitled to extensions of time. For instance, under the Kipchak Cultural Center
Contract, the Claimant was entitled to nearly two years worth of extensions of time due to
the Respondent’s late registration of the Contract, delays in progress payments, and a 68%

increase in the construction area imposed by the State Expert Review.

The Claimant also complains that decisions by the TAC terminating the seven Contracts did
not take into account the Claimant’s entitlement to extensions, and that it was not notified
of the TAC proceedings and therefore deprived of its fundamental right to defend itself. The
Claimant further alleges that the individuals who appeared on its behalf in some of the

proceedings were not authorized to represent it, and that the power of attorney documents

29

139.

140.

141.

142.

on which the Respondent relies in this respect are forged. It also argues that in one instance,
the TAC terminated one of its Contracts, namely the Babarap Projects Contract, even though
the Contracting Party had not even requested the TAC to do so in the statement of claim it

submitted to the Court.

Sixth, the Claimant alleges that at the end of 2009, the Respondent abusively attempted to
encash the full USD 40 million value of the guarantees provided by the Claimant under three
of its Contracts, namely the Babarap Projects Contract, the Avaza Canal Contract, and the
Ashgabat Cinema Contract. The Claimant argues that the Central Bank of Turkmenistan
encashed the full amounts of the guarantees despite being informed by the Contracting
Parties themselves that certain amounts should have been deducted from the guarantees to
reflect the fact that part of the advance payments received by the Claimant had already been
repaid in the form of works performed. The Claimant further argues that the guarantees
should not, in any event, have been encashed by the Respondent, as the relevant Contracts

had been wrongly terminated.

Seventh, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent’s tax authorities frequently blocked its
accounts on the basis that it had failed to make certain VAT payments. Given that many of
the Claimant’s progress payments were paid late, the VAT payments relating to those
progress payments were also delayed. However, pursuant to a Turkmen regulation, the
payment of taxes accrued from the performance of the Contracts was the responsibility of
the Contracting Parties, and therefore the blocking of the Claimant’s accounts was

unjustified.

Eighth, the Claimant contends that it was discriminated against in favor of Polimeks, another
Turkish contractor which, like the Claimant, had been awarded a contract for half of the
Avaza Canal Project. It suggests that Polimeks secured the more favorable treatment as a
result of a special relationship with the President of Turkmenistan, which was allegedly

developed or maintained by means of expensive gifts.

The Claimant contends in particular that Polimeks’ contract contained more favorable

financing terms than the Claimant’s, as Polimeks was entitled to payment of a larger share

30

143.

144.

145.

146.

of the value of materials and equipment prior to their importation, which granted it an unfair
advantage. In addition, after the State Fund was abolished, the Claimant argues that it was
pressured to sign an amendment to its contract which shifted onto the Claimant the burden
of financing imported materials and equipment until their shipment. However, the financing

terms in Polimeks’ contract were not similarly amended.

The Claimant further alleges that Polimeks was paid for its works by the relevant
Contracting Party, that its contract was not terminated, and that it was not required to pay
delay penalties, even though it had been unable to complete its works according to schedule.
In addition, after the Claimant’s contract for the Avaza Canal Project was terminated, the
Respondent assigned the Claimant’s works to Polimeks to complete, and allowed Polimeks

to use its materials and equipment.

Ninth, after the Claimant was allegedly forced to leave its construction sites in August and
September 2009, following the Contracting Parties’ terminations of its remaining Contracts,
the Respondent knowingly permitted the illegal use by the Contracting Parties and other
contractors of the Claimant’s equipment and materials, including equipment and materials
which had not been attached by the TAC. The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s
allegations that its employees had rented or sold the equipment and materials to pay the
Claimant’s debts, and in particular argues that an alleged “Rent Protocol” with Polimeks

relied on by the Respondent is a fabrication.

The Claimant also argues that the Supreme Court of Turkmenistan requested the Customs
Service to prevent it from removing all of its equipment and materials from Turkmenistan.
As a result, the Claimant has been indefinitely prevented from re-exporting even the

equipment and materials which had not been attached by the TAC.

Tenth, the Claimant contends that the Respondent’s security forces harassed its workers and
personnel. It alleges in particular that, without valid reasons, members of its personnel were
banned from leaving Turkmenistan, that their passports were confiscated, that they were
unjustly detained, and that their houses were raided by the Turkmen police without any legal

grounds, with the aim of coercing and threatening them. The Claimant also argues that upon

31

147.

148.

the termination of its remaining Contracts, the visas of its personnel were revoked, depriving

it of an opportunity to liquidate its business and facilities in Turkmenistan.

Finally, the Claimant contends that its inability to collect progress payments from the
Respondent, and the encashment of its bank guarantees, led a Turkish bank to revoke an
offer for a long term credit to finance the construction of a hydroelectric plant, the Kemah
Dam, by a related company, i¢kale Enerji, making it impossible for the Claimant to initiate
the project. In addition, the Respondent’s actions led Turkish banks to recall their loans,
and made it impossible for the Claimant to obtain bank guarantees for any new projects
which would have allowed it to pay off its loans. As a result, the Claimant was forced to
sell its license to build the Kemah Dam, and its shares in i¢kale Enerji. In doing so, the
Claimant alleges that it lost the substantial profits which i¢kale Enerji expected to earn from

the Kemah Dam project, for which it seeks compensation.

3.2. The Respondent’s case
3.2.1 The Respondent’s contentions

149. The Respondent, Turkmenistan, is a sovereign State, in the territory of which the Claimant’s
various Projects were located. The Respondent contends that since it gained independence
in 1991, Turkmenistan has worked to modernize the country, and has attracted large numbers

of investors in the process, in particular from Turkey. Of the 1,661 registered foreign
5 Claimant’s PHB, para. 508.

33

investors in Turkmenistan as at the end of 2013, 31% were Turkish. In addition, of the 733
construction projects which were awarded by the Respondent between 2007 and 2013, a

majority, namely 568, were awarded to Turkish contractors.

150. The Respondent takes the position that the claims in this arbitration represent an attempt by
the Claimant to blame Turkmenistan for its own failures under the Contracts. The
Respondent contends that the Claimant did not have the managerial, technical, human, and
financial resources to execute the significant works it had undertaken pursuant to the thirteen
Contracts which it had concluded, with one exception, over a short half-year period spanning
from March to November 2007, and which all provided for completion of the works in a
period of two years or less. The Claimant failed to execute its Projects despite receiving
significant advance payments, as well as considerable amounts in progress payments. As a
result of these payments, the Claimant, starting from the end of 2007, at all times had a net

cash position of at least USD 30 million for the Projects.

151.

According to the Respondent, between March 2007, when it concluded the first of the
Contracts, and September 2009, when it left Turkmenistan, the Claimant completed only
approximately 40% of the works it had undertaken to perform. The Respondent argues that
the Claimant “failed completely to execute all but two of its thirteen projects in
Turkmenistan in accordance with its contractual undertakings.”® Ultimately, the Contracting
Parties lost patience with the Claimant, and terminated the Contracts which remained to be

completed.

152. With respect to each of the individual Contracts at issue, the Respondent makes, inter alia,

the following allegations:

e Avaza Canal Contract: The Respondent alleges that the Claimant was required to
complete its works under the Avaza Canal Contract, the largest of the Contracts at issue
in this arbitration, with a value of approximately USD 120 million, by October 2009.

However, by the time the Contract was terminated by the Contracting Party in August

© Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 35:16-19.

34

2009, shortly before the completion date, the Claimant had performed works

representing only approximately 20% to 28% of the contract price.

The Respondent contests the Claimant’s allegations that its failure to perform was caused
by delayed payments resulting from the abolition of the State Fund. It contends that by
the time the Contract was terminated in August 2009, the Claimant had received
approximately USD 47.3 million in advance and progress payments, representing
approximately 40% of the contract price. In addition, the State Fund was abolished well
before the Claimant submitted its first progress report in July 2008, in respect of which

it received payment without delay.

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant was required to implement at its own
costs any instructions by the State Expert Review to add support piles for the bridges
which formed part of the Project in order to comply with the relevant construction norms,
and to widen the canal to allow for boating in accordance with the technical

specifications.

Avaza Hotel Contract: The Claimant’s works under the Avaza Hotel Contract, which
was concluded in March 2007, were to be completed by May 2008. However, by the
end of 2007, the Claimant had completed works representing only approximately 17%
of the contract price. According to the Respondent, the Claimant was therefore well
behind schedule even before the State Fund was abolished in February 2008. In addition,
even after February 2008, progress payments were made in a timely manner, with few

exceptions.

Upon the request of the Claimant, the completion date under the Avaza Hotel Contract
was extended until June 2009, however the Claimant still was unable to finish the
Project. Indeed, the Respondent alleges that the Contracting Party was required to retain
other contractors to correct a number of significant defects, including in respect of the
sewage disposal system, desalination unit, boiler room equipment, fire protection
system, and rainwater leaks in the rooms. As a result, the State Acceptance Committee

did not issue a certificate of handover, and the 5% retention was not paid to the Claimant.

35

The Respondent further contests the Claimant’s allegations that it was required to
perform additional works on the Project, arguing that it has not shown any relevant

instructions from the State Expert Review, or any evidence that it performed such works.

Ashgabat Cinema Contract: The Claimant’s works under the Ashgabat Cinema
Contract, which was concluded in July 2008 and registered in September 2008, were to
be completed by December 2009. However, according to the Respondent, the Claimant
performed almost no work on the Project. By September 2009, when the Contract was
terminated, the Claimant had not submitted any progress reports for performed works.
Accordingly, no progress payments could have been delayed. In addition, the works that
the Claimant did complete were defective. In particular, the Claimant used a type of
cement which was not in accordance with the construction norms for the seismic zone
in which the cinema was to be built. The Respondent also contests the Claimant’s
allegation that it was required to perform additional works on the Project. It further
argues that, while the registration of the annexes to the Contract were delayed, the delay
was caused by the Claimant’s repeated failure to submit the relevant information for the

annexes.

Abadan School and Kindergarten Contracts: The Claimant’s works under the two
contracts, which were concluded in November 2007, were to be completed by August
2008. The Respondent contends that by the original August 2008 completion date for
the Abadan School and Kindergarten Projects, the Claimant had completed only about
8% and 9% of the works, respectively. The Claimant obtained an extension until
September 2009, however, by the time the extended completion date was reached, it had
still only completed 14% and 11% of the works, respectively. The Respondent further
contests that the Claimant’s works were delayed by poor weather, arguing that the
Claimant first raised the issue more than a year after the alleged weather events, and did

not invoke the force majeure clause in the Contract.

Dayhanbank Contract: The Claimant’s works under the Dayhanbank Contract, which

was concluded in July 2007, were to be completed by February 2009. However, by the

36

original completion date, the Claimant had only performed 41% of the works. While the
Claimant was granted an extension, it also failed to meet the extended completion date.
The Respondent further alleges that by the fall of 2009, when the Contracting Party
terminated the Contract, the Claimant had abandoned the site, and had not completed

any work for six months.

Kipchak Cultural Centre Contract: The Respondent contends that the Kipchak
Cultural Centre Contract, which was concluded in August 2007, was, contrary to the
Claimant’s allegations, registered approximately two months later. It further alleges
that, after completing less than 20% of the works by April 2008, and not performing any
further works for the rest of 2008, the Claimant failed to meet the original December
2008 completion date. The Claimant also subsequently failed to make any serious efforts
to meet an extended completion date of September 2009, which it had requested in
March 2009. Indeed, according to the Respondent, the Claimant did not submit any
progress reports after the extension was granted, and, by the time the Contract was
terminated in September 2009, had completed significantly less than the 40% of the

works which it alleges it completed.

Kipchak School Contract: The Respondent contends that the Claimant failed to meet
the original December 2008 completion deadline under the Kipchak School Contract,
which was concluded in June 2007, or the extended March 2009 deadline, as a result of
its slow progress. It further alleges that in February 2009, the Contracting Party
identified a number of defects, including problems with waterproofing, fire protection,
and cracks, which were never addressed. As a result, no handover certificate could be

issued.

Kipchak Hotel Contract: According to the Respondent, although the Claimant initially
made steady progress on its works under the Kipchak Hotel Contract, which was
concluded in August 2007, its works slowed after June 2008, and it failed to meet the

December 2008 completion date. Although the Parties extended the completion date to

37

March 2009, the Claimant never finished the works, and failed to address a number of

defects it was requested to rectify. As a result, no handover certificate could be issued.

Ministry of Economy Contract: The Respondent takes the position that, due to the slow
progress of the Claimant’s works under the Ministry of Economy Contract, which was
concluded in March 2007, the Claimant failed to meet the original October 2008
completion date, even though its progress payment were paid on time. The Claimant
also failed to meet an extended July 2009 deadline. Its last progress report of June 2009
shows that it completed only 90% of the works, and it abandoned the Project with almost
a tenth of the works left incomplete. The Respondent further contends that the Claimant
has not shown that it was required to perform any additional works, and that the
Contracting Party had in fact agreed to reduce the scope of the Claimant’s works when

it granted it an extension of the completion date.

Babarap Projects Contract: The Babarap Projects consisted of several facilities,
namely a school, a kindergarten, a health center, a commercial center, an administrative
building, and a cultural center. The completion date for the facilities under the Babarap
Projects Contract, which was concluded in September 2007, was September 2009,
although the Claimant’s slow progress and defects in its works led to an extension until
February 2010. However, the Claimant did not make any progress on the kindergarten,
commercial center, administrative building, and cultural center, and the Contracting
Party ultimately terminated the Contract and imposed delay penalties. The Respondent
contests the Claimant’s allegations that its lack of progress was attributable to delayed
progress payments and force majeure, arguing that the progress payments were made in
a timely manner, and that the Claimant never submitted a notice of force majeure. It
also argues that the works that were completed by the Claimant were plagued by
numerous defects which prevented the State Acceptance Committee from issuing a

handover certificate.

Ashgabat Kindergarten Contract: The Respondent contends that the Ashgabat

Kindergarten Project was completed in large part in 2008, and agrees that the Claimant

38

is entitled to receive the 5% retention amount. However, when the warranty period under
the Ashgabat Kindergarten Contract ended, the Claimant never submitted a final invoice
for the payment of the 5% retention amount. The Respondent further alleges that there
is no basis for the Claimant’s allegation that it was required to perform additional works

for which it was entitled to payment.

e¢ Ruhiyet Mansion Contract: The Respondent alleges that, like the Ashgabat
Kindergarten Project, the Ruhiyet Mansion Project was completed in large part in 2008,
although the Claimant failed to complete the works by the October 2008 completion
date. The Respondent alleges that it has been unable to determine, on the basis of its
records, whether the Claimant completed the handover procedure under the Ruhiyet
Mansion Contract, triggering the warranty period, and therefore whether it is entitled to
the payment of the 5% retention amount. It also contests that the Claimant was required
to perform additional works for which it was entitled to payment, and argues that any
payment delays were not caused by the abolition of the State Fund, as the State Fund

never made any payments under the Ruhiyet Mansion Contract.

153. In response to the Claimant’s allegations concerning delays in progress payments and the
abolishment of the State Fund, the Respondent contends that an analysis of the various
Projects shows that most progress payments were made in a timely manner, and that the
Claimant’s failure to complete its works was not attributable to the delayed payment or non-
payment of progress payments. In addition, according to the Respondent, neither the
Contracts nor the presidential decrees awarding them contain any assurances that the State
Fund, which was abolished as part of a reorganization of the manner in which the State
financed contracts, would be maintained. It further contends that, contrary to the Claimant’s
allegations, the Presidential Decree abolishing the State Fund did not put in place a
mechanism according to which the President and the Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers
were required to authorize any payments made under the hundreds of contracts concluded
by State-owned entities or agencies. The Decree merely required that the contracts pursuant

to which payments are made must be authorized by a presidential decree.

157.

With respect to the delay penalties imposed on the Claimant, the Respondent contends that
the delays on the Projects were attributable to the Claimant, and therefore that delay penalties
were properly imposed. It goes on to argue that the Claimant admitted its liability for delay
penalties by signing addenda to several of its Contracts according to which the completion
dates were extended, while providing that the Claimant would not be released from paying
delay penalties. In addition, in respect of the Avaza Hotel Contract, the Kipchak School
Contract and the Kipchak Hotel Contract, the Claimant signed delay penalty certificates
setting out the amounts of delay penalties for which it was liable, and then deducted those
amounts from its invoices. The Respondent further contests that the Claimant was forced to
sign these addenda and certificates, and that the Turkmen State was involved in the

imposition of delay penalties.

The termination of seven of the Claimant’s Contracts was, according to the Respondent,
justified in view of the Claimant’s delays. In any event, State authorities, and in particular
the President of Turkmenistan and the Cabinet of Ministers, were not responsible for the
decisions to terminate the Contracts. The approvals of the terminations by the Cabinet of
Ministers were, according to the Respondent, merely a legal formality deriving from the fact
that the Contracts had been authorized by a Presidential Decree. It was the Contracting

Parties that took the decisions to terminate the Contracts.

The Respondent further contests the Claimant’s allegations regarding the proceedings in the
context of which the TAC issued decisions imposing delay penalties and terminating several
of the Contracts. In particular, the Respondent argues that the Claimant was notified of the
various proceedings, and that in some of the proceedings, it was represented by what

appeared to be duly authorized representatives with valid powers of attorney.

With respect to the Claimant’s allegations that the Central Bank of Turkmenistan improperly
encashed the full amounts of the Claimant’s advance payment guarantees under three of the
terminated Contracts, namely the Babarap Projects Contract, the Avaza Canal Contract, and
the Ashgabat Cinema Contract, the Respondent counters that it was appropriate to encash
the guarantees given that the Claimant had failed to perform works of a value anywhere

close to the amount of the advance payments it received. The Respondent further contends

40

158.

159.

160.

that the issue of the encashment of the full USD 40 million value of the guarantees, despite
the fact that the Claimant was allegedly entitled to a USD 2 million deduction for works it
had completed, which was the subject of Austrian court proceedings, has been settled by the
Contracting Parties’ provision of waivers for the USD 2 million amount. Finally, the role
of the Central Bank of Turkmenistan, on which the Claimant apparently relies to argue that
the Turkmen State was responsible for the encashment of the guarantees, was, according to
the Respondent, limited to verifying that the signatures on the Contracting Parties’ demands

were authentic.

On the issue of the freezing of the Claimant’s bank accounts by the Turkmen tax authorities,
the Respondent takes the position that although the Contracting Parties under some of the
Contracts had undertaken to pay VAT directly to the tax authorities, the Claimant remained
liable for the payments under Turkmen tax law. Therefore, the tax authorities were entitled
to take measures against the Claimant if the Contracting Parties failed to make the VAT

payments in a timely manner.

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant prevented the completion of the handover
procedure under several of its Contracts. It contends in particular that the Claimant failed
to remedy defects identified by the Contracting Parties and the State Acceptance
Committees. In these circumstances, the State Acceptance Committees, which included
representatives of the Ministry of Construction and Fire Safety Administration officials,
could not issue a handover certificate, and the Contracting Parties were required to retain
other contractors to remedy the Claimant’s defects. The Respondent further argues that the
Claimant’s allegations that the Turkmen State, and in particular the President, sought to

prevent the payment of the 5% retention amounts, are unsupported and lack credibility.

As to the Claimant’s allegations that it was required to perform additional works without
payment, the Respondent contends that the Contracts were lump-sum Engineering,
Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) Contracts, which required the Claimant to design
the facilities to be built in accordance with the technical specifications and the applicable
norms and regulations. The Respondent argues that the technical specifications that formed

part of the tender documentation contained only basic outlines of the Projects with minimal

41

161.

162.

163.

164.

information, including the project’s purpose and a general total area. It was the
Respondent’s obligation to ensure that its designs complied with the applicable norms and

regulations, compliance with which was verified by the State Expert Review.

In addition, the Respondent argues that had the Claimant been requested to perform works
which it considered to be beyond its scope of works under the Contracts, it should have
proposed an amendment to the contract price in accordance with the mechanism set out

under the Contracts. However, the Claimant never proposed any such amendments.

As to the Claimant’s allegation that it was discriminated against in favor of Polimeks, the
Respondent argues that while there were variations in the financing terms for equipment
under the Claimant’s and Polimeks’ contracts for the Avaza Canal Project, Polimeks’ terms
were not more favorable. In particular, it contends that the Claimant’s allegations are based
on a miscalculation of the amounts to which it was entitled under the financing terms in its
Contract. The Respondent further contends that, as was the case for the Claimant, some of
Polimeks’ progress payments were paid late, but that this did not have an impact on its

performance under its contract.

The Respondent also argues that the Claimant’s personnel who remained in Turkmenistan
after its high-level management left the country rented out and sold materials which the
Claimant had left behind in an effort to pay unpaid debts to the Claimant’s various
subcontractors and suppliers. The Claimant’s allegations that these agreements were
fabrications, or concluded by individuals who did not have the authority to sign on behalf of
the Claimant, are unsupported and lack credibility. The Respondent was also not aware of

these transactions, which were between the Claimant and other contractors, at the time.

According to the Respondent, the Claimant also abandoned much of its machinery and
equipment by failing to make any effort to remove it following the termination of its
Contracts. The Respondent further contends that the Claimant has not adduced any evidence
that the machinery and equipment remained in Turkmenistan, under the possession and

ownership of the Claimant, or as to its condition.

42

165. Finally, the Respondent contests the Claimant’s allegations that members of its personnel
were harassed by Turkmen security forces and were subjected to travel bans, arguing that
the Claimant has not produced any documentary evidence in support. In addition, the
Respondent maintains that under Turkmen law, and under the Contracts, its authorities were
entitled to revoke the visas of the Claimant’s international employees upon termination of

the Contracts.

3.2.2 The Respondent’s request for relief

166. In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent requests that “this case should be dismissed for
lack of jurisdiction, or, if jurisdiction is sustained, all claims should be dismissed on the
merits, and Claimant should be ordered to pay Respondent’s costs incurred in this

Arbitration.””

4 THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE VII(2) OF THE TURKEY-
TURKMENISTAN BIT

 

167. The Parties disagree on the interpretation of Article VII(2) of the BIT, which forms part of
the investor-State dispute resolution clause in the Treaty. The Respondent argues that the
provision sets out a mandatory domestic litigation requirement, whereas the Claimant
contends that the provision gives the foreign investor an option either to submit the dispute
to local courts or to proceed directly to international arbitration. The Parties’ divergent
positions reflect the less than felicitous drafting of the English version of the clause, as well
as the fact that the English version of the Treaty provides that it was done “in two authentic

”*® whereas the Russian version states that it was executed “in

copies in Russian and English,
two authentic copies in the Turkish, Turkmen, English, Russian languages.”” While there is
no dispute between the Parties that only the English and Russian versions were executed,
and that no Turkmen version of the Treaty was ever prepared, or at least that none has been
found, they disagree on the translation of the Russian version of the clause, as well as on the

relevance of the Turkish version.

168. The English version of Article VII(2) of the BIT reads as follows:

“2. If these d[i]sputes [i.e., disputes between one of the State parties to the Treaty and
an investor of the other State party] cannot be settled in this way [i.e., by negotiation]
within six months following the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph
J, the dispute can be submitted, as the investor may choose, to:

(a) The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) set up by
the ‘Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals
of other States’, (in case both Parties become signatories of this Convention.)

(b) an ad hoc court of arbitration laid down under the Arbitration Rules of Procedure
of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), (in case
both parties are members of U.N.)

(c) the Court of Arbitration of the Paris In[t]ernational Chamber of Commerce,

provided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of
justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a final award has not been

rendered within one year.”'°
169. The dispute is focused on the interpretation of the “provided that, if” clause at the end of the
provision, with those three words emphasized in the above quotation. According to the
Respondent, the clause means that the submission of the dispute before the local courts is a
mandatory requirement: an investor may proceed to international arbitration only if the
dispute has first been submitted to local courts, and the courts have not rendered a final
decision within one year. By contrast, the Claimant reads the clause to mean that the
submission of the dispute is only an option: the investor may first submit the dispute to local

courts, but it does not have to; it may also proceed directly to international arbitration.

170. The Parties have advanced extensive legal argument and submitted extensive expert
evidence on the meaning and effect of Article VII(2), and the Claimant has also produced a
witness of fact, Ms Zergul Ozbilgic, who appeared for examination at the Hearing. The
Parties have also addressed the findings of other arbitral tribunals on the meaning and effect
of Article VII(2), including, in particular, the decisions of the tribunals in Kilig and

Muhammet Cap & Sehil Insaat Endustri ve Ticaret Ltd. Sti. v. Turkmenistan (“Sehil’”)."!

4.1 The Respondent’s position

171. The Respondent argues that Article VII(2) of the BIT contains a mandatory domestic
litigation requirement which the Claimant did not satisfy, and therefore the Tribunal should
dismiss this arbitration for lack of jurisdiction. According to the Respondent, Article VII(2)
provides that an investor may only submit a dispute to arbitration under the BIT if it has first

submitted it to the domestic courts of the host State, and the domestic courts have not

rendered a decision within one year. The condition is “an essential element of the State’s

consent to international arbitration under the Treaty,” and is therefore a “jurisdictional pre-

requisite.”!”

172. The Respondent argues that the mandatory nature of the domestic litigation requirement is
apparent from all three versions of the BIT, namely the Russian, Turkish, and English

versions.

173. As to the Russian version of the BIT, the Respondent relies on the following translation:

“2. If the referenced conflicts cannot be settled in this way within six months following
the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the conflict may be
submitted at investor's choice to

(a) The International Center for Settlement of Investment Conflicts, set up in
accordance with the ‘Convention for Settlement of Investment Conflicts between States
and Nationals of Other States’, in case both Parties signed this Convention;

(b) ‘ad hoc’, established in accordance with the Arbitration procedural rules of the
United Nations Commission for International Trade Law, in case the Parties are
members of U.N.;

(c) The Court of Arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of Commerce, on the
condition that the concerned investor submitted the conflict to the court of the Party,
that is a Party to the conflict, and a final arbitral award on compensation of damages
has not been rendered within one year.”

174. According to the Respondent, the key phrase in the Russian text of Article VII(2) is “pri
uslovii, esli,’ which means “on the condition that” or “provided that.” The Claimant’s
translation of “pri uslovii, esli” as “provided that, if’ is an inaccurate and misguided
mechanical translation. Although “es/i” alone can be translated as “if,” it does not have an
independent syntactic function in the phrase “pri uslovii, esli,” which is a compound

conjunction. The phrase is rather “a single conditional expression that clearly conveys a

(emphasis added).

46

mandatory condition.”'* In support of its position, the Respondent relies on the Expert

Linguistics Opinion of Professor Gasparov.!>

175. The Respondent also refers to the Turkish version of the BIT, which, in its view, clearly
imposes a mandatory domestic litigation requirement and constitutes an “authentic” version
of the BIT under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “Vienna Convention”),
as the Russian version refers to “authentic copies” in Turkish and Turkmen. According to
the Respondent, the Turkish version must have been the original version of the BIT, which
is reflected in the fact that it is clear and contains no grammatical, syntactical or
typographical errors. It is not plausible that the Turkish version was only prepared at the

time of ratification, as alleged by the Claimant.

176. Finally, the Respondent argues that the English version of Article VII(2) of the BIT does not
have an ordinary meaning, as the “if” in the phrase “provided that, if ...” adds a “second,
redundant conditional word” that creates a sentence with a nonsensical grammatical
structure given the absence of a “corresponding ‘then’ to complete an ‘if, then’
construction:”!©

“2. If these d[i]sputes cannot be settled in this way within six months following the

(b) an ad hoc court of arbitration laid down under the Arbitration Rules of Procedure

provided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of

justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a final award has not been

rendered within one year.”""

The Respondent argues that the wording of the English version of Article VII(2) BIT
indicates that an error was made in translating the BIT from Russian to English, as the
Russian equivalent of “provided that” would, if translated literally, have a “double

conditional formulation that does not make sense in English.”!*

According to the
Respondent, the Claimant’s position that the English version was the original version is

purely speculative.

Based on its assessment of the various versions of the BIT, the Respondent contends that
the ordinary meaning and good faith interpretation of Article VII(2) of the BIT under Article
31 of the Vienna Convention is that the State Parties intended to include a mandatory
domestic litigation requirement. This is also the meaning that “best reconciles the texts,
having regard to the object and purpose of the Treaty” pursuant to Article 33(4) of the

Vienna Convention.

According to the Respondent, it is irrelevant whether the Russian and Turkish versions of
the BIT were translated from the English version. The Tribunal should rather interpret the
texts based on their ordinary meanings, which are clear in the Russian and Turkish texts.
The English version, which is unclear, must be interpreted in good faith consistently with
the Russian and Turkish texts. The Respondent argues that, even if the Turkish version is
deemed not to be authentic, it is nevertheless a supplementary means of interpretation under
Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, which supports the conclusion that Article VII(2) of
the BIT imposes a mandatory domestic litigation requirement. In any event, the letters from
the Turkish government dated 3 December 2012 and 26 May 2011, which the Claimant
relies on in support of its position that the English version of the BIT was the “‘first agreed

version’ from which all the other translations originated”! are not credible and do not

constitute “preparatory work” within the meaning of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention,

as they were created for the purposes of pending arbitrations.

The Respondent finally argues that any doubt as to the interpretation of Article VII(2) of the
BIT has been dispelled by the award in the Kili¢ case, in which the tribunal found that the
provision imposes a mandatory domestic litigation requirement and, as a result, dismissed
the claimant’s case for lack of jurisdiction.” Other cases relied on by the Claimant, namely

Rumeli vy. Kazakhstan?! and Sistem v. Kyrgyzstan,”

which dealt with provisions similar to
Article VII(2) of the BIT, according to the Respondent provide no meaningful guidance to

this Tribunal, as they only dealt with the provisions in a cursory and unpersuasive manner.

The Respondent also challenges the Claimant’s reliance on the jurisdictional decision in the
Sehil case, which was issued shortly before the Hearing, and in which the tribunal found that
Article VII(2) of the BIT provided that domestic litigation was optional. According to the
Respondent, the two conflicting decisions relating to the same provision, Kilig and Sehil,
highlight the need for a proper application of the rules of treaty interpretation. The
Respondent argues that the Sehil tribunal misunderstood the expert evidence of Professor
Gasparov in particular, and “apparently inferred, erroneously, that a ‘tautological’ structure

23 and that the tribunal “improperly accorded superiority to the English

indicates ambiguity,
version” of the Treaty over the Russian version.”4 The Respondent also contends that “[t]he
Sehil tribunal’s view that it would not be ‘fair and equitable’ to require submission to local
courts as a precondition to international arbitration cannot be squared with Article 26 [of the

ICSID Convention] or with all the treaties and decisions that have required precisely that.””°

4.2 The Claimant’s position

182.

183.

184.

The Claimant argues, in response, that Article VII(2) of the BIT does not impose a
mandatory domestic litigation requirement, but rather constitutes a type of fork-in-the-road
clause. According to the Claimant, the provision sets out that resorting to the local courts
of the host State is optional, but that if an investor chooses that option, it can only
subsequently submit the dispute to arbitration if the local courts have not rendered a decision

within a year.

The Claimant argues that, contrary to the Respondent’s position, there is no authentic
Turkish version of the BIT because the Turkish version was not executed by both Parties
and was prepared unilaterally after ratification, for publication in the Official Gazette of
Turkey. According to the Claimant, the BIT was executed only in English and Russian. The
State Parties did not execute the Turkish or Turkmen versions, and did not agree to their
authenticity at a later date; Turkmenistan has also failed to provide any evidence that it
acquiesced or accepted the Turkish version of the BIT. The Claimant argues that there was
a lack of agreement between the State parties as to any version other than the English and
Russian versions. The reference in the Russian version to “authentic copies” in Turkish and
Turkmen cannot elevate the Turkish text to the status of an authentic version, as it did not
exist at the time the BIT was executed. In addition, relying on the testimony of Ms Ozbilgic,
an official with the Turkish Ministry of Economy who was involved in the drafting of the
BIT, the Claimant argues that the Government of Turkey provided the draft BIT in English
to Turkmenistan, and that the Russian version was translated from the English version,

which does not mention the Turkish version.

Like the Russian version, the Turkish version was also inaccurately translated from the
English version. However, it was translated only after the BIT was concluded, and merely
in order to comply with Turkish procedural requirements for ratification, including

publication in the Official Gazette. The Claimant relies in this respect on the testimony of

50

185.

186.

187.

188.

Ms Ozbilgic, and on a letter from the Turkish Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade of 26 May
2011.76

As to the English version of the BIT, the Claimant argues that the only ordinary meaning
that can be attributed to Article VII(2) of the BIT pursuant to Article 31 of the Vienna
Convention, and the only good faith interpretation of the provision, is that it does not impose
a domestic litigation requirement. Rather, it only provides that if the investor has submitted
the dispute to the domestic courts and a decision is rendered within a year, it can no longer

resort to arbitration.

According to the Claimant, this interpretation is confirmed by the supplementary means of

interpretation contemplated in Article 32 of the Vienna Convention.

In particular, the Claimant alleges that the draft of the English version of the BIT was
prepared by Turkey with the intention of granting investors a right to apply directly to
arbitration, and was accepted without modification by Turkmenistan. The Claimant relies
in this respect on the testimony of Ms Ozbilgic, as well as on explanation provided by the
Office of the Prime Minister of Turkey to the Turkish Parliament in the context of the
ratification of the BIT, which indicated that investors could resort to arbitration directly,
without having to submit the dispute to the domestic courts of the host State.?” The Claimant
contends that this document, together with the parliamentary records,?* constitutes

“preparatory work” within the meaning of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention.

The Claimant also contends that the Russian version of Article VII(2) of the BIT, when
interpreted in good faith, and in accordance with its ordinary meaning, provides that

investors may resort directly to arbitration without first submitting a dispute to the domestic

courts of the host State, and confirms the optional nature of the investor’s choice to resort to

local courts.

The Claimant relies on a different translation of the Russian version of Article VII(2) than
the Respondent (see paragraph 173 above), which contains the wording “on the condition

that, if ...” instead of only “on the condition that:”

“2. If these conflicts cannot be settled in this way within six months following the date
of the written notification mentioned in Paragraph 1, the conflict may be submitted,
as the investor may choose, to:

(a) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID),
established in accordance with the ‘Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States’, if both the Parties have signed
the Convention;

(b) Anad hoc court, established in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), if the Parties are
members of the UN;

(c) The Arbitration Court of the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce, on
the condition that, if the concerned investor submitted the conflict to the court of the
Party, that is a Party to the conflict, and a final arbitral award on compensation of
damages has not been rendered within one year.””
According to the Claimant, the Russian version is ambiguous and grammatically incorrect,
as it contains two commas in the phrase “pri uslovii, esli,” indicating that it was merely a
poor, literal translation of the English version.*” In support of its allegation, the Claimant
relies on a letter from the Turkish Ministry of Economy dated 3 December 2012,*! and the
testimony of Ms Ozbilgic. According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s translation of the
Russian version, which omits a comma and the term “if” from the phrase “on the condition
that, if ... ,” constitutes an attempt to rewrite the authentic Russian version of the BIT to

deviate from its literal translation of the original English version.

52

191. The Claimant further argues that, even if there is a difference between the Russian and
English versions, the meaning that best reconciles the texts in accordance with Article 33(4)
of the Vienna Convention is the meaning in the English version granting the investor the
option of proceeding directly to international arbitration. According to the Claimant, Turkey
had a clear interest in guaranteeing that its investors could have access to arbitration without
having to first resort to the local courts, and Turkmenistan did not conduct any serious

negotiations on this provision.

192. The Claimant also contends that other bilateral investment treaties concluded by Turkey and
Turkmenistan show that it was both States’ policy not to require prior recourse to the host
State’s domestic courts before an investor could initiate arbitration. In support of its
argument, the Claimant points to the fact that of the 76 treaties concluded by Turkey, fifteen

”32 and that the Turkish versions of ten

contain “virtually the same exception as exists here,
of these expressly allow for direct recourse to arbitration unless the investor has already
brought the dispute to the domestic courts of the host State and the courts have not rendered
a decision within one year. Turkey’s remaining 61 treaties, as well as all of Turkmenistan’s
other treaties, to the extent that they are publicly available, do not impose any restriction at

all on the right of an investor to resort to arbitration.

193. Finally, the Claimant argues that the Kili¢ decision does not have any precedential value.
According to the Claimant, the tribunal in that case reached its conclusions under

”°33 as it did not have the benefit of the evidence on record in

“extraordinary circumstances’
this arbitration, in particular of a linguistic expert opinion showing that the Russian version
of Article VII(2) was an erroneous translation from the English version, or of the evidence

of a witness who was involved in the preparation of the BIT.

194. The Claimant relies heavily on the Sehil decision, which as noted above was issued just a
few weeks before the Hearing. According to the Claimant, the Sehil tribunal’s decision

confirms its position that Article VII(2) of the BIT provides for “an option allowing investors

to bring their disputes in international arbitration venues or in the local courts of host
States.”*+ The Claimant stresses, in particular, that the Sehil tribunal specifically concluded
that the terms “pri uslovii, esli” in the Russian version of the Treaty “should also be

considered as ambiguous.”*>

The Tribunal’s analysis

The issue before the Tribunal is one of treaty interpretation. The Parties agree that the
relevant rules of treaty interpretation are reflected in the Vienna Convention, specifically in
Articles 31 through 33. Article 31 sets out the “general rule” of treaty interpretation, whereas
Article 32 provides for supplementary means of interpretation which may be applied, “in
order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the
meaning when the interpretation according to article 31: (a) [I]eaves the meaning ambiguous
or obscure; or (b) [IJeads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.” Article

33, in turn, deals with the interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages.

According to the English version of the BIT, the Treaty was done “in two authentic copies
in Russian and English.”*° However, the Russian version provides that the Treaty was
“[e]xecuted in two authentic copies in the Turkish, Turkmen, English and Russian
languages.”*” As noted above, neither Party disputes that no Turkmen version was ever
prepared, and in any event no such version has been found or made available to the Tribunal.
However, the Parties disagree on when exactly the Turkish version was prepared, and on
whether it should be considered “authentic.” Both Parties have also presented argument and

evidence on the meaning and effect of the Turkish version in the course of the arbitration.

One issue that is undisputed is that the Russian version is an authentic version, and that it
was available to both Parties at the time of the signature of the BIT, since that version was

signed. However, the Parties disagree on how the Russian version should be translated into

English; this disagreement is amplified by the Parties’ differing views on how the English
version should be interpreted, in particular whether the relevant Russian version of the clause
“pri uslovii, esli” should be translated as “provided that” or “provided that, if.” The
Respondent argues that the former translation is the accurate one, whereas the Claimant
relies on the latter translation. The differing translations then lead the Respondent to argue
that domestic litigation is mandatory also according to the Russian version, whereas the
Claimant argues that the Russian translation is literally the same as the English version and

also incorporates an optional clause.

The Tribunal considers that the first step in the process of establishing the meaning of Article
VII(2) of the BIT is to consider the general rule of treaty interpretation as set out in Article

31 of the Vienna Convention. Article 31 provides:

“1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith and in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its
object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in
addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in
connection with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the
conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to
the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the
treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the
agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the
parties.

55

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so
intended.”**

199. When read in its context, and in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms, it is

200.

201.

evident that Article VII(2) of the BIT is drafted in a manner that effectively leaves its
meaning, in particular the meaning of the clause “provided that, if’ unclear or obscure.
While the two conditions in the beginning of the sentence (“provided that” and “if”) suggest
that the phrase would include a “then” clause setting out the consequence, there is no such
consequence but rather an additional or parallel condition relating only to the “provided that”
phrase (but not to the “if’”) in the beginning of the sentence. In effect, the clause can be read
in either of the following two “corrected” ways, both of which would have the effect of

eliminating the lack of clarity:

(1) “provided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts
of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute[,] end a final award has not been
rendered within one year;” or

(2) “provided that; the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts
of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a final award has not been
rendered within one year.”

The first reading, which suggests that the domestic litigation route is merely an option, and
not mandatory, is effectively that adopted by the Claimant. The second reading, which
indicates that the domestic litigation requirement is mandatory, is that adopted by the

Respondent.

The evidence of the Parties’ experts, which was also tested at the Hearing, establishes that
the lack of clarity can linguistically be understood either as a semantic or syntactic (or
grammatical) error in the drafting or construction of the clause, likely because it had been
drafted by non-native speakers of English. Dr Patricia Palmer, who testified for the
Claimant, preferred a syntactic “edit” of the problem, that is, the elimination of the word

“and” as redundant as this would do least violence to the text and arguably preserve the

intended (semantic) meaning of its drafter.” Professor Jaklin Kornfilt, who testified for the
Respondent, preferred a semantic correction, namely a reading that eliminated one of the
two conditionals (“provided that” or “if’) in the beginning of the sentence rather than the
word “and;” according to her, this would be more “loyal, closer to the text” as there are two
conditionals but only one “and,” and would thus better preserve the syntactic integrity of the

clause.*°

However, while the Tribunal finds the linguistic analysis helpful, it principally assists it in
better understanding the linguistic source (if not the factual cause) of the lack of clarity in
the clause, without fully resolving the issue of interpretation. The task of the Tribunal is not
to “correct” the text of the Treaty; it must take the clause, as drafted and agreed to by the
Parties, and then interpret it as such, as drafted and agreed, in accordance with the relevant
tules of treaty interpretation. These rules include the general rule of treaty interpretation set
out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention; however, as noted above, the application of this
rule leaves the meaning of Article VII(2), in particular of the “provided that, if’ clause
unclear, or obscure: the clause combines elements of what can be construed as two
conflicting intentions as to its meaning, namely the double conditional in the beginning of
the clause (“provided that, if’) suggesting that the word “and” later in the sentence is a
typographical or drafting error, or alternatively, the word “and” in the middle of the clause
suggesting that the double conditional in the beginning of the sentence is a typographical or

drafting error.

In accordance with the established rules of treaty interpretation, the Tribunal must therefore
have recourse to supplementary means of interpretation to determine the meaning of Article

VII(2) of the BIT; according to Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, such supplementary

further of the view that the “provided that, if’ clause was “incomplete and not grammatically well-formed, and
consequently does not determine or project or support any specific interpretation at all.” Accordingly, from a
linguistic perspective, the clause is in her view “meaningless;” Expert Linguistics Opinion of Prof. Georgia M. Green

means of interpretation apply, inter alia, “when the interpretation according to Article 31
[...] [eaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure.”*! Article 32 (“Supplementary Means of

Treaty Interpretation”) of the Vienna Convention provides:

“Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the
preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to
confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the
meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:

(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or

(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.”

204. According to Article 32, the supplementary means of interpretation that the Tribunal may
resort to include “the preparatory work of the treaty” and “the circumstances of its
conclusion.” In the present case, there is very limited evidence of any preparatory works,
however the Parties have made extensive reference to the circumstances of the conclusion
of the Treaty, including the other investment treaties concluded by the two State parties to
the Treaty during the relevant period. The Parties have also made extensive reference to the
Turkish version of the BIT, which was prepared at the time of its ratification, and to the
accompanying note to the Turkish Parliament. They disagree, however, as to whether the
Turkish version should be considered as an “authentic” version of the BIT, or at least as part
of “the circumstances of its conclusion” under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, which
is the position of the Respondent, or whether it is simply irrelevant, which appears to be the
position adopted by the Claimant. Accordingly, in order to properly characterize the status
of the Turkish version of the BIT, the Tribunal must first decide whether it can be considered
an “authentic” version of the BIT. The issue arises because of the difference between the
English and the Russian version of the BIT. The English version provides that the Treaty

42

was done “in two authentic copies in Russian and English,”*” whereas the Russian text

4 In the Tribunal’s view, the “provided that, if” clause can be said to be “obscure” rather than “ambiguous” in the
sense that the two conflicting meanings of the clause are not apparent on the face of the clause — which they would
be if the clause was ambiguous; they are disclosed only once one attempts to correct the awkward structure of the
clause.

* English version of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT, Exhibit C-001 (Reply).

58

provides that the Treaty was executed “in two authentic copies in the Turkish, Turkmen,

English and Russian languages.”*

205. The relevant rules of treaty interpretation applicable to this issue can be found in Article 33
(“Interpretation of Treaties Authenticated in Two or More Languages”) of the Vienna
Convention. According to Article 33(1), when a treaty has been authenticated in two or
more languages, “the text is equally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides
or the parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.” In the present
case, there are no provisions in the BIT or agreement between the Parties that either of the
two versions, English and Russian, should prevail in case of divergence. Accordingly, both
versions must be considered as being equally authoritative. In the circumstances, the

Tribunal is required to apply the rule set forth in Article 33(4) of the Vienna Convention:

“Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1, when a
comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the
application of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles
the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.”

206. The first step in the process is therefore to determine whether the “difference of meaning”
between the English and the Russian version can be removed by the application of Article
31 and 32. The Tribunal notes, in this connection, that the Russian version is awkwardly
worded in the sense that, like the English version, it refers to “two authentic copies,” but
then lists four different languages. This suggests that there is a drafting error in the text,
which in theory could be corrected, similarly to the correction that could be made to the
“provided that, if” clause, either by eliminating the word “two,” or by eliminating two of the
languages, that is, Turkish and Turkmen. This would leave only English and Russian,
which would in turn make the two language versions consistent. However, as noted above,
this is not a method available under the rules of treaty interpretation; the Tribunal must

interpret the Treaty as drafted and agreed by the Parties. Consequently, as the application

of the general rule of treaty interpretation in Article 31 leaves the meaning of the language
clause obscure, the Tribunal must have recourse to supplementary means of treaty
interpretation, which include the “preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of

its conclusion.”

The Tribunal is prepared to accept the evidence of Ms Ozbilgi¢ that the Turkish version of
the Treaty was only prepared in the context of the ratification of the Treaty by Turkish
Parliament. The Turkish version was not “done” or “executed” on 2 May 1992 in Ashgabat,
together with the English and Russian versions.*> The Respondent argues that nonetheless,
even if the Turkish version was not executed at the time, it may be deemed an authentic
version because it was designated as such by the State parties to the Treaty. The Tribunal is
unable to agree with this argument as the reference to the Turkish version as an “authentic”
version is only to be found in the Russian version; there is no such designation in the English
version of the Treaty. In the circumstances, the reference to Turkish as an “authentic” copy
in the Russian version of the BIT cannot be deemed evidence of the State parties’ agreement;
on the contrary, it is precisely the discrepancy between the English and the Russian versions

on this point that raises the issue of interpretation.

There is no evidence before the Tribunal, contemporaneous or otherwise, that the State
parties ever intended that the Turkish version prepared after the adoption of the English and
Russian texts should be deemed authentic. In the circumstances, as the application of
Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention fails to remove the difference between the
English and the Russian versions, the Tribunal must adopt the meaning “which best
reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty.” The Tribunal
finds, applying this rule, that the meaning that best reconciles the two texts is that only the
English and the Russian version of the Treaty are to be considered authentic; it is only these
two versions that are mentioned in both the English and the Russian version of the BIT. This
interpretation is also supported by Article 10 of the Vienna Convention, which provides that,

if a treaty does not provide for any specific procedure for authentication, the signed or

is no mention of Ashgabat in the Russian version.

initialed version of the treaty shall be considered authentic. It follows that the Turkish
version cannot be considered an authentic version of the Treaty. However, this does not
mean that it is irrelevant as it may nonetheless be considered to form a “supplementary
means of interpretation,” and possibly part of the “circumstances of [the] conclusion” of the

BIT, within the meaning of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention.

Having determined that only the English and Russian versions of the BIT may be considered
authentic versions, the Tribunal will now turn to the interpretation of the “provided that, if”
clause, in light of the supplementary means of treaty interpretation set out in Article 32 of
the BIT, which include “the preparatory work of the treaty” and “the circumstances of its
conclusion.”*© As noted above, the Turkish version of the BIT may be considered in this

context as a “supplementary means of interpretation.”

As noted above, there is no dispute between the Parties that the preparatory works of the
Treaty are extremely limited. There are no prior drafts of the Treaty, or minutes of meetings
between the State parties when the Treaty was negotiated. The only relevant evidence is the
witness statement and oral evidence of Ms Ozbilgic, who participated in the preparation of
the draft BIT as a junior legal counsel (as she then was) at the Turkish Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.7_ However, while the Tribunal finds Ms Ozbilgic’s evidence helpful in
understanding the way in which Turkey prepared for investment treaty negotiations, her
evidence sheds little light on the States’ common intentions, in particular as regards the
interpretation of Article VII(2), as she did not attend any of the meetings in which the Treaty

was agreed and signed. Although Ms Ozbilgi¢ stated that the Republic of Turkey had the

47 The Tribunal has also taken note of the Letter from the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade of the Prime Ministry of
Turkey to Bozbey insaat San. Tic. Ltd. Sti. dated 26 May 2011, Exhibit C-096 (Reply), and of the Letter from the
Ministry of Economy of Turkey to Sakmar Law Office dated 3 Dec. 2012, Exhibit C-095 (Reply). The former letter
expresses a view on how Article VII(2) of the BIT should be interpreted, whereas the latter states that the English
version of the BIT “is based on the English text of the draft agreement which was prepared previously by our country,”
that the draft was submitted to Turkmen authorities in March 1992 in Moscow by the Turkish Consulate, and that the
Russian version “was translated from the English version on which the parties agreed into Russian shortly before
signing the agreement.” While these statements do not appear to contradict the evidence on record, they are not

general policy of promoting foreign investment and supporting the protection of investments
of Turkish investors abroad, the Tribunal is unable to draw any firm conclusions from such
policy regarding the interpretation of Article VII(2) of the Treaty. As noted above,
investment treaties, including the present one, are by their nature reciprocal arrangements,
involving a trade-off between achieving the highest possible level of protection of the State’s
own investors in the territory of the other State party while seeking to avoid unnecessary
international litigation and minimizing the risk of having to defend against unjustified or
illegitimate claims by investors of the other State party. When negotiating the BIT, the
Republic of Turkey must be assumed to have considered both sides of this trade-off. The
Tribunal cannot assume, in the absence of any reliable documentary or other
contemporaneous evidence, that Turkey was merely interested in maximizing the protection
of its own investors in Turkmenistan, and was without concern as to its potential exposure
to claims from Turkmen investors, keeping in mind that the Treaty was concluded for an
initial period of ten years and would continue to be in force thereafter unless terminated by
either party.** The Tribunal therefore is unable to adopt an interpretation of Article VII(2)
of the BIT, and in particular of the “provided that, if” clause, that would effectively favor

Turkish investors in case of any ambiguity or obscurity.

The Tribunal next turns to considering the circumstances of conclusion of the Treaty. As

noted above, the Turkish version of the BIT has been argued to be considered in this context.

The Respondent in particular relies on the Turkish version of the BIT to support its reading
of the mandatory nature of the “provided that, if’ clause. According to the English
translation of the Turkish version provided by the Respondent, Article VII(2) provides that
recourse may be had to international arbitration, “provided that the investor has brought the
subject matter of the dispute to the judicial court of the host Party in accordance with the
procedures and laws of the host Party and that a decision has not been rendered within one

year.” The Respondent argues that the mandatory Turkish version shows that Turkey had

no policy of favoring international arbitration over local court proceedings, and that this

should be taken into account in the interpretation of the “provided that, if” clause.

The Claimant does not dispute that the Turkish version employs mandatory language.
However, it argues that the mandatory language results from an inaccurate translation from
the authentic English version, and points out that the explanatory note accompanying the
Treaty when it was submitted to the Turkish Parliament explains in clear terms that the

clause was intended to be optional. The note states, in relevant part:

“Article 7- This Article regulates the procedure on settlement of the disputes which
may arise between one Party and the investor of the other Party. As per the procedure
prescribed under this Article, the dispute first shall be tried to resolve amicably. If
the dispute cannot be resolved within six months, provided that the right for resorting
to the local courts is reserved, the dispute may be submitted to the
international arbitration.

On the other hand, if the investor has brought the dispute to the local courts of the
host state and a final decision is rendered by the local court then the right to submit
the dispute to the international arbitration can not be used. However, if a final
decision is not rendered within I year by the local court and provided that the Parties
are party to the relevant conventions, the respective dispute may be submitted to
International Centre for the Settlement of the Investment Disputes (ICSID) or the
Arbitration Tribunal to be formed in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules or the Arbitration Court of Paris International Chamber of Commerce.

The purpose of the last paragraph is to prevent the discussion of the disputes before
an international institution, which were settled with a final decision rendered by the
local courts.”*°

The Claimant argues that the “provided that, if’ clause “should be, in fact, [...] considered
as a fork in [the] road clause, which forces the investors to make a choice between the
application to the international arbitration or to the local courts of the host State.”>!

Having considered both the Turkish version of Article VII(2) of the BIT as well as the

accompanying explanatory note, the Tribunal notes that there is an apparent contradiction

between the two documents. The former indicates that the domestic litigation requirement
is mandatory, whereas the latter suggests that the requirement is optional. In the
circumstances, even assuming the Turkish version of the BIT and the explanatory note were
to be considered to form part of the “circumstances of [the] conclusion” of the Treaty, this
evidence is inconclusive and does not allow the Tribunal to determine the meaning of Article

VII(2) of the BIT.

In addition to the Turkish version of the BIT and the explanatory note, the Parties have also
sought to rely on the other investment treaties concluded by both Turkey and Turkmenistan
during the relevant period in support of their respective positions. According to the
Claimant, other investment treaties concluded by Turkey at the time employed a language
which is similar or identical to Article VII(2) of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT, including its
treaties with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, which were all concluded within a

few days and indeed during the same trip of the Prime Minister of Turkey.

The Respondent argues, in response, that “Turkey has entered into at least a dozen BITs that
require prior submission to local courts before permitting recourse to international
arbitration,” and that even if there were no other such treaties, “that would not prove that the

mandatory text of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT is not mandatory.”°

According to the
Respondent, a review of Turkey’s BITs entered into both before and after the Treaty shows
that Turkey had no policy against mandatory local court requirements, and that the result of
such a review is therefore inconclusive. It contends that “[e]ach treaty must be considered
and enforced according to its own terms.”**

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the argument and evidence relied upon by the Parties,
and concludes that the evidence relating to the preparation of the other investment treaties
concluded by Turkey and Turkmenistan during the relevant period does not allow it to draw
any firm conclusions as to the interpretation of Article VII(2) of the BIT. The Tribunal

notes, for instance, that the Turkish translations of the English version of the relevant

221.

clauses, even when using the same language as in the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT, are not
always consistent, and there also appear to be differences between the different authentic
versions. Nor have the Parties conducted a systematic analysis of each of the authentic
versions of the various BITs, but have mainly argued in terms of the English versions. In
any event, based on the evidence before it, neither Turkey nor Turkmenistan appears to have
had a clear, or at least consistent policy regarding the resolution of investor-State disputes
that could be taken into account in the interpretation of the “provided that, if” clause in the
Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT as a supplementary means of interpretation. The Tribunal
concludes that the application of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention does not allow it to

determine conclusively the meaning of Article VII(2) of the BIT.

The Tribunal will therefore next turn to the interpretation of the Russian version of the BIT.
As noted above, the Parties disagree on this issue, the Respondent arguing that the Russian
version of Article VII(2) uses language that is clearly mandatory on its face, whereas the
Claimant argues that the Russian version of the provision can be translated in a manner that

is literally the same as the English version.

As noted above, both Parties have provided expert evidence in support of their positions.
The Tribunal notes that, of the Claimant’s three Russian language experts, two were not
called for cross-examination at the Hearing, namely Mr Alexander Makarov and Mr
Konstantin Kozyrev, whereas Mr Peter Barber and the Respondent’s experts Professor Boris
Gasparov and Professor Georgia Green were called and subjected to cross-examination as
well as questioning by the Tribunal. The Tribunal has considered the totality of the evidence,

including the declarations of Mr Makarov and Mr Kozyrev, in reaching its conclusions.

The Tribunal notes that the statements of Mr Makarov are short and limited to providing a

literal translation of the Russian version of Article VII(2), without any further substantive

  

analysis. Mr Kozyrev does provide comments on the translation of the “provided that, if”
clause, noting that the use of a comma in the Russian version of the Treaty is grammatically

incorrect, as it is not correct to put a comma after “es/i” in the phrase “pri uslovii, esli,” and

65

222.

223.

that the use of the comma “makes the meaning of the whole sentence ambiguous.”**

Mr Kozyrev concludes that, should the “pri uslovii, esli,” clause be considered mandatory,
it would only apply to the option of submitting a dispute to the Court of Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICC”), but not to the ICSID and UNCITRAL
options.» The Tribunal notes that, although the Claimant refers to Mr Kozyrev’s position,
it has not adopted this position in the arbitration.*° Mr Kozyrev also opines that the Russian

version is a translation from the English version of the Treaty.

Mr Barber is a professional translator and reviser, and, in this capacity, expressed a view on
both the English and the Russian version of Article VII(2) of the BIT. He stressed in his
written opinion and at the Hearing that he took a “practical” approach to the issue. He states
in his written opinion that he has to “discard” the “other opinions [...] in favour of [his]
more pragmatic and practical assessment.” He goes on to state that “the original English,
despite being awkwardly worded,” introduces a proviso that is optional and not mandatory,
and that the Russian translation also reflects this meaning.*” According to Mr Barber, it is
only the “second — interpretative — back-translation” relied on by the Respondent that has
“confused the picture.”°* At the Hearing, Mr Barber confirmed that he had been instructed
that the Russian version had been translated from the English one, and that he had taken this

understanding as a basis of his analysis.*?

Professor Gasparov submitted two opinions in the course of the arbitration, and he was also
questioned on his evidence at the hearing. Professor Gasparov testified that the expression

“pri uslovii, esli” is, in his opinion, “absolutely clear” and “unambiguously clear.”® He

explained that while the expression is tautological, this is because it is idiomatic, and there
are many expressions in any language that are idiomatic but grammatically correct because
they have become a way of expression and the formal tautology has become irrelevant.°!
There is no ambiguity whatsoever as to the meaning of “pri uslovii, esli” it must be translated
into English as “provided that,” and not “provided that, if.” According to Professor
Gasparov, the latter would be a literal translation, but it does not convey the idiomatic

meaning of the phrase.

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the Parties’ expert evidence, including both the expert
opinions and the oral evidence that unfolded at the Hearing. The Tribunal has decided to
accept Professor Gasparov’s evidence on the proper translation of the Russian expression
“pri uslovii, esli.” Professor Gasparov’s evidence, on which he was cross-examined by the
Claimant and also extensively questioned by the Tribunal, was reliable and compelling. The
Claimant’s expert Mr Barber approached his task more pragmatically, as a translator or a
reviser, and based on his understanding that the Russian text was a translation from the
English version. However, there is no contemporaneous evidence before the Tribunal that
this is the case, and in any event, both the English and the Russian versions are authentic
versions of the Treaty, and their meaning must be established independently. Accordingly,
the Tribunal accepts that the terms “pri uslovii, esli” must be translated into English as
“provided that.” It follows that the Russian version of Article VII(2) of the BIT has a
mandatory meaning: it means that an investor, whether a Turkish or a Turkmen investor,
may initiate international arbitration proceedings by choosing one of the three procedural
options (ICSID, UNCITRAL or ICC), provided that the investor concerned has brought the
dispute before the courts of justice of the Party that is party to the dispute and a final award

has not been rendered within one year.
The Tribunal notes, in this context, that there is a further difference between the English and

the Russian versions of Article VII(2) of the BIT, which was noted by Mr Kozyrev, one of

the Claimant’s Russian language experts, but was not pursued by the Claimant in the course

Gasparov referred to the French question “Qu’est-ce que c’est” as an example of a tautological but

 

grammatically correct and unambiguous expression: Hearing Transcript, Day 4, pp. 106:17-107:1.

of the arbitration. The difference is that the “pri uslovii, esli” clause in the Russian version
is formatted in such a way that it forms part of Article VII(2)(c) of the Treaty and, unlike
the English version, is not separated out from sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) setting out the
three arbitration options.” The question therefore arises whether, because of the formatting,
the “pri uslovii, esli” clause should be interpreted so as to apply only to the ICC option, but
not to the ICSID and UNCITRAL options.

226. The Tribunal does not consider this to be the persuasive or proper interpretation. As noted
above, in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, a treaty shall as a general
rule be interpreted “in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the
terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.” While
formatting may be considered part of the “context” of a treaty, the Tribunal considers that,
if read in the broader context of Article VII(2) of the BIT as a whole, the “pri uslovii, esli”

clause cannot be read, in good faith, so as to apply only to the ICC option, and indeed neither

Party argues that this would be the case.® The Tribunal notes that the application of Article

33(3) of the Vienna Convention, which provides that “[t]he terms of the treaty shall be

presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text,” would in any event lead to the

same conclusion. As the terms of the English and Russian version of Article VII(2) are the
same (setting aside the issue of the translation into English of the terms “pri uslovii, esli,”
which is not relevant for the purpose of determining whether the clause beginning with these
terms applies to all three arbitration options or only the last one), it cannot be concluded that

the difference in formatting alone should lead to a different interpretation.

227. The remaining task for the Tribunal is to consider the meaning of the two authentic texts of

the Treaty, English and Russian. As determined above, the two meanings of the “provided

© For instance, the English translation of the Russian version of Art. VII(2)(c) of the BIT submitted by the Respondent
at Exhibit RA-1, is formatted as follows:

“(c) The Court of Arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of Commerce, on the condition that the
concerned investor submitted the conflict to the court of the Party, that is a Party to the conflict, and a final
arbitral award on compensation of damages has not been rendered within a year.”

See supra paras. 171-194. The Tribunal notes that the Sehil tribunal similarly found that “it makes no sense for the
proviso, however it is understood, to apply to ICC arbitration and not to ICSID and ad hoc arbitration.” (Sehil, Exhibit
RA-451, para. 233.)

229.

that, if’ clause of the Treaty diverge: the meaning of the English version remains obscure,
while the Russian version is clear and unambiguous. Consequently, as the Treaty does not
establish which language version prevails in case of divergence, the relevant rule of treaty
interpretation to address the divergence is set forth in Article 33(4) of the Vienna
Convention. According to this provision, “when a comparison of authentic texts discloses
a difference in meaning which the application of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the
meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the

treaty, shall be adopted.”

The Tribunal notes that the application of Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention does
not remove the difference in meaning between the English and the Russian versions of
Article VII(2) of the BIT; as determined above, the application of Article 31 leaves the
meaning of the English version of the provision obscure, and the application of Article 32
fails to remove the difference, whereas the Russian version, as translated above, is clear and
unambiguous and does not require recourse to supplementary means of interpretation. In
these circumstances, the meaning that best reconciles the English and the Russian version is
the meaning ascribed above to the Russian version; it is evident that an obscure meaning
must give way to a clear and unambiguous meaning. The object and purpose of the Treaty,
to which regard must be had under Article 33(4) of the Vienna Convention, cannot alter this
conclusion; indeed, it is evident that both a mandatory and a non-mandatory reading of the
“provided that, if’ clause would be compatible with the promotion of economic co-operation
and development, more effective utilization of economic resources, and the promotion and
protection of foreign investment, which according to the Preamble of the BIT constitute its
object and purpose. The choice between the two readings depends entirely on what the State
parties consider to be the appropriate dispute resolution procedure. The Tribunal concludes,
by majority, that the “provided that, if’ clause in Article VII(2) of the BIT must be
interpreted so as to require recourse to domestic courts before international arbitration

proceedings may be commenced.

The Tribunal notes that other treaty tribunals have reached divergent decisions on the

interpretation of Article VII(2) of the BIT. For instance, the Kili¢ tribunal concluded that

69

the domestic litigation requirement in the provision is mandatory, whereas the Sehil tribunal
found that it is optional. The Parties have relied in their submissions on the earlier decisions,
in particular the decisions of the Kilig and Sehil tribunals, and the Tribunal has carefully
considered the relevant parts of their reasoning. The Tribunal notes that each of the two
tribunals took its decision on the basis of the evidence and argument before them, which
differed from that which was available to this Tribunal, and reached different conclusions.
Consistent with its mandate, which is limited to resolving the dispute submitted to it, this
Tribunal must also base its decision on the argument and evidence before it, which includes
the decisions of the Kilig and Sehil tribunals. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that it
has attempted to ensure that the record before it is as complete as possible. As summarized
in Section 2 above, the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 2 dated 28 June 2012 directed the
Parties to address “all aspects of the issue” in their submissions, including “the various
language versions of the BIT, including the existence of a Turkmen version of the BIT; [...]
the authenticity of the various language versions of the BIT; [...] the accuracy of the English
translations of each of the authentic versions of the BIT; [...] the negotiating history of the
BIT, including travaux préparatoires, if any; [...].” The Parties were also invited to produce
witness testimony, as appropriate, and to address the applicable rules of treaty interpretation.
In this connection, the Tribunal merely notes that the Sehil tribunal, which concluded on the
basis of the evidence before it that both the English and Russian version of Article VII(2)
were ambiguous, also saw “little logic in requiring investors simultaneously to negotiate for
six months and to go to local courts for a year from the same start date.” According to the

Sehil tribunal,

“[a] better, much more plausible interpretation that would avoid this logical
hurdle and be consistent with the permissive language of Article VII(2)’s chapeau,
is that only investors who choose to go to local courts first will have to wait for a
year prior to initiating international arbitration proceedings (in the absence of a
final decision within the one-year period). By contrast, investors who choose
directly to initiate international arbitration proceedings will only have to negotiate
for six months after the notice of dispute prior to going to arbitration. ”®

5 Sehil, Exhibit RA-451, para. 239. (Emphasis in original.)

70

230. With respect, the Tribunal is unable to agree with this reasoning. The logic, or the effect, of

231.

Article VII(2) of the BIT, as interpreted above, is to establish a time-limited priority for
domestic litigation in relation to international arbitration as a method of dispute resolution,
in the event that the dispute cannot be settled during the six-month negotiation (or “cooling-
off”) period. The one-year period for domestic litigation starts from the end date of the six-
month negotiation period, not from the start date of the negotiation period. If there is no
“final award” during this one-year period, the investor may proceed to international
arbitration. Certainly the State parties could have agreed to make domestic litigation merely
an alternative to international arbitration, but this is not what they agreed in Article VII(2)

of the BIT, properly interpreted.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that, while its decision resolves the issue of interpretation of
Article VII(2) of the BIT, this is not necessarily the end of the matter as it leaves open the
question of the legal nature of the domestic litigation requirement in Article VII(2) of the
Treaty. This is an issue that the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 1 also specifically
requested the Parties to address in their submissions, and it is the issue to which the Tribunal

will turn next.

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

The Respondent advances several preliminary objections that it characterizes as objections
to jurisdiction. First, it argues that Article VII(2) of the BIT contains a domestic litigation
requirement which the Claimant has failed to comply with. Second, it argues that the
Claimant has not made any “investment” in Turkmenistan within the meaning of Article 25
of the ICSID Convention or Article I(2) of the BIT. Third, it argues that the Claimant’s
claims are not treaty claims but contract claims which are subject to the dispute settlement
provisions of the relevant Contracts, all of which provide for recourse to the Arbitration

Court of Turkmenistan, and thus fall outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal addresses each of the Respondent’s objections in turn below.

The legal nature of the domestic litigation requirement in Article VII(2) of the BIT

The Respondent’s first objection is that Article VII(2) of the BIT contains a domestic
litigation requirement which the Claimant failed to comply with, and that accordingly the
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. The Claimant contests that Article VII(2) of the BIT sets out a
mandatory domestic litigation requirement and argues that, in any event, it should not be
held to the domestic litigation requirement as resorting to Turkmen courts would have been
futile. The Claimant further submits, in the alternative, that it is entitled to rely on the most-

favored nation (“MEN”) clause in Article II(2) of the BIT to circumvent it.

The Tribunal has reached above, by majority, the conclusion that Article VII(2) of the BIT
indeed establishes a “mandatory” domestic litigation requirement in the sense that the
language of the provision, properly interpreted, requires the investor to submit the dispute
first to local courts, and only if no decision is reached within a year, the investor may refer
its claim to international arbitration. However, as also noted above, this conclusion is

distinct from — and leaves open — the question of the legal nature of this requirement.

The Tribunal recalls that in Procedural Order No. 2 dated 28 June 2012, it invited the Parties
to address, inter alia, the question of “whether the objection put forward by Respondent on

the basis of its interpretation of Article VII(2) of the BIT raises an issue of jurisdiction or an

72

237.

238.

239.

issue of admissibility.” The Claimant did not mention the issue either in its Memorial or in
its Reply; however, the Respondent addressed the issue in detail in its Counter-Memorial.
The Respondent argued, citing Daimler v. Argentina, that “[iJn the present case,
Turkmenistan’s offer to arbitrate was expressly conditioned upon the investor’s compliance

7966

with the mandatory provisions of Article VII(2). The condition is therefore a

“jurisdictional pre-requisite.”*”
The Tribunal also raised the question of the legal nature of the requirement upon the
completion of the Hearing, requesting that the Parties address it in their post-hearing

submissions.

The Claimant in its post-hearing submission addressed the issue briefly, stating that “the
investor’s choice of one of the two legal remedies prescribed under Article VII(2) raises a
jurisdictional issue” and “is not an admissibility issue.”°® The Respondent, on the other
hand, addressed the issue in extenso in its post-hearing submission. The Respondent
reiterated its argument that Article VII(2) constitutes “a condition to Turkmenistan’s offer
to submit itself to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal to arbitrate investor-State
disputes under the Treaty.”®’ According to the Respondent, this was also the conclusion
reached by the Kili¢ tribunal. The Respondent also noted that the Claimant had never

contested the Respondent’s position.

Both Parties have therefore taken the position that compliance with Article VII(2) of the BIT
is an issue of jurisdiction rather than admissibility. The question arises whether the Tribunal
is bound by the Parties’ shared legal position. After a careful consideration of the applicable
legal framework, the Tribunal concludes that it is not. The Tribunal refers in this connection,
in particular, to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41(2) of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules. Article 41 of the ICSID Convention establishes that the “[t]he Tribunal shall be the

judge of its own competence,” and Rule 41(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides,
importantly, that “[t]he Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the
proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of
the Centre and within its own competence.” The Tribunal considers that these two
provisions provide it with the authority to decide independently, within its Kompetenz-
Kompetenz, and without being bound by the Parties’ legal positions, as to whether the
objection raised by the Respondent under Article VII(2) of the BIT constitutes an objection
to jurisdiction or an objection to admissibility. Indeed, if this were not the case, and if the
Tribunal were to be considered bound by the legal argument of the Parties, the Tribunal
might have to reach a decision that it does not consider to be legally correct. This cannot be
the proper reading of the Tribunal’s authority under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention and
Rule 41(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules; the Tribunal must have the authority to take a
decision that it deems correct, so long as it has given the Parties an opportunity to argue the

issue it has raised. As set out above, this is what the Tribunal has done in the present case.

The Tribunal has carefully considered the Parties’ positions on the issue, in particular that
of the Respondent, which has set out its position in a more elaborate manner than the
Claimant. The Tribunal decides, by majority, that Article VII(2) of the Treaty does not
constitute “a condition to Turkmenistan’s offer to submit itself to the jurisdiction of an
international tribunal to arbitrate investor-State disputes under the Treaty,” as argued by the
Respondent.” Properly characterized, the domestic litigation requirement is not a condition
to the State parties’ consent to arbitrate under the Treaty. The consent of the two State
parties to arbitrate, as set out in Article VII of the Treaty,”! is unconditional; apart from the
ratification requirement in Article IX of the Treaty, which applies to the Treaty as a whole

and not only to Article VII, the Treaty does not establish any conditions precedent for the

 

rom the reasoning in paragraphs 240-247, which reflect the views of the majority of the

Tribunal. See Partially Dissenting Opinion of Professor Sands.

7! Unlike many other investment treaties, the Treaty does not specifically provide that the State parties consent to
arbitrate, but such consent is implicit in the chapeau of Art. VII(2), which provides that, if a dispute between one of
the State parties and an investor of the other party cannot be settled by negotiation, it “can be submitted, as the investor
may choose, to [ICSID, ad hoc arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules, or ICC arbitration].” (English version of the
Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT, Exhibit C-001 (Reply).)

14

State parties’ consent to take effect before the Treaty enters into force upon its ratification
pursuant to Article IX.”* Apart from the requirement of ratification, which applied to the
Treaty as a whole, there were no further conditions precedent for the entry into force of the
Treaty, including its Article VII(2), and accordingly the State parties’ consent to arbitrate
became effective, unconditionally, when the Treaty entered into force. It is another matter
that the scope of their consent to arbitrate is not unlimited under the Treaty, but extends only
so far as delimited by the Treaty, specifically in Article IX (which delimits the scope of the
State parties’ consent in terms of time),”* Article I(1) (which delimits the scope of their
consent in terms of person),’* and Article I(2) (which delimits the scope of their consent in

terms of subject matter).’°

241.

In the Tribunal’s view, the proper way to characterize Article VII of the BIT is that it is a
dispute resolution clause which, apart from establishing the consent of the State parties to
arbitrate, sets out the procedure that an investor must follow, or the steps it must take, before
it can invoke the consent to arbitrate given by a State party to the Treaty. First, the investor
must notify the State party to the dispute in writing of the dispute that has arisen between
them and seek to settle the dispute by consultation and negotiation; this procedural step is
set out in Article VII(1). If the dispute cannot be settled in this way within six months from

the date of notification, the investor may choose to submit the dispute to international

” According to Article IX(1) of the BIT, the Treaty “shall enter into force on the date on which the exchange of
instruments of ratification has been completed.”

7 According to Art. IX of the BIT, the Treaty enters into force on the date on which the exchange of instruments of
ratification has been completed, and remains in force a period of ten years; it will continue to be in force thereafter
unless terminated by either Party by written notice. The Treaty applies to investments existing at the time of entry
into force, as well as to investments that were made or acquired prior to the date of termination for a period of ten
years from the date of termination. Consequently, in terms of time, the Treaty (and the jurisdiction ratione temporis
of an arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance with Art. VII of the Treaty) is open-ended so long as it is in force: it
applies to investments made prior to its entry into force, as well as to any investment made thereafter.

™ According to Art. I(1), the Treaty applies to natural persons who are nationals of either State party to the Treaty
according to the its applicable law, as well as to “corporations, firms or business associations incorporated or
constituted under the law in force of either of the Parties and having their headquarters in the territory of that Party.”
Accordingly, the jurisdiction ratione personae of an arbitral tribunal constituted under Art. VII (read together with
Art. VII(1) of the BIT) is limited to claims brought by persons so defined against the other State party.

  

 

75 Art. VII(1) of the Treaty applies to disputes arising “in connection with [the investor’s] investment,” as defined in
Art. I(2) of the Treaty. Accordingly, the jurisdiction ratione materiae of an arbitral tribunal constituted under Art.
VII of the Treaty is limited to investment disputes (disputes arising “in connection with” an investment).

75

242.

243.

76 Ms Lamm dissents from t

arbitration pursuant to Article VII(2) of the Treaty, “provided that, if the investor concerned
has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute
and a final award has not been rendered within one year.” The Tribunal has decided above
that this prior step is in principle mandatory, and accordingly, before the investor can submit
the dispute to international arbitration, it must take the additional step of submitting the
dispute to local courts.”° If no final judgment has been rendered within a period of one year,

the investor may proceed to arbitration.

When conceptualized in these terms, it is plain that the “provided that, if’ clause does not
constitute a jurisdictional requirement that delimits the scope of consent of the State parties
to arbitrate; it sets out the procedure, or the step to be taken, in the event the dispute cannot
be settled by way of negotiations between the parties, and thus constitutes a procedural rather
than a jurisdictional requirement. The provision does not concern the issue of whether the
State parties have given their consent to arbitrate — they have — but rather the issue of how
that consent is to be invoked by a foreign investor; as an issue of “how” rather than
“whether,” it must be considered a matter of procedure and not as an element of the State
parties’ consent. Consequently, any objection raised on the basis of alleged non-compliance
by an investor with any of the required procedural steps must be characterized as an
objection to the admissibility of the claim rather than as an objection to the tribunal’s
jurisdiction. A claim that has not been first submitted to local courts may be said to be
inadmissible before an international tribunal on grounds that it is not yet ripe for such

submission as all the required procedural steps have not yet been taken.

On this issue, the Tribunal’s decision diverges from the approach adopted in the Kili¢
Award, in which the majority of the tribunal took the view that the domestic litigation
requirement constitutes a condition precedent to the State parties’ consent to arbitrate and is

therefore an issue of jurisdiction.”” The majority of the Kilig¢ tribunal characterized the

  

sentence to the extent that reference is made to the selection of local courts being in

principle mandatory. See Partially Dissenting Opinion of Ms Lamm.

7 Kile Award, Exhibit RA-314. Prof. William W. Park issued a Separate Opinion, taking the view that Art. VII(2)

raised an issue of “ripeness, recevabilité or admiss

 

ility” rather than jurisdiction; see Separate Opinion of Professor

dispute resolution clause in Article VII of the BIT as the State parties’ “standing offer” to
arbitrate, which then had to be “accepted” by the investor. In the view of the Kili¢ majority,
an arbitration agreement therefore could come into existence only “through a qualifying
investor’s acceptance of a host state’s standing offer as made (i.e., under its terms and
conditions).”’* The majority referred, in support of its reasoning, to Article 26 of the ICSID
Convention, which provides, inter alia, that “[a] Contracting State may require the
exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to
arbitration under the Convention.” Citing Professor Schreuer’s article “Consent to
Arbitration,” Professor Georges Abi-Saab’s dissenting opinion in Abaclat and others v.
Argentine Republic and the Daimler v. Argentine Republic decision, the majority concluded
that “the requirements set forth in Article VII.2 are to be treated as conditions, and that the
failure to meet those conditions goes to the existence of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and are
not to be treated as issues of admissibility.”

With the greatest respect to the distinguished majority of the Kzli¢ tribunal, this Tribunal is
unable to agree with the Kilig tribunal’s characterization of the issue. The BIT is not a
contract; it is a treaty concluded by two States, and consequently the arbitration agreement
concluded between one of the State parties and an investor of the other State party is not an
arbitration agreement concluded on the basis of privity of contract, that is, on the basis of an
“offer” and “acceptance.” On the contrary, the State’s consent, which is addressed to an
anonymous class of foreign investors meeting the relevant nationality requirements, and not
specifically to any particular foreign investor, is expressed in a binding manner even before
any dispute has arisen, whereas the investor’s consent is usually — including in the present
case — expressed only after the dispute has arisen, often with a considerable time interval (in
) 80

the present case, over eighteen years).”” While it is common and often harmless to somewhat

loosely refer to dispute resolution clauses such as Article VII of the BIT as provisions

containing the State parties’ “standing offer” to arbitrate, this is in fact conceptually

inaccurate and legally incorrect; Article VII rather contains the State parties’ “consent” to

245.

arbitrate, which is binding on the State as such, without any further “perfecting,” as a
unilateral undertaking vis-a-vis a class of foreign investors. Such consent can be invoked
by a qualified investor once it has complied with and taken the procedural steps set out in
the provision, as analyzed above in paragraph 241. While it is possible to refer, loosely
speaking, to each of these steps as a “condition” to the State parties’ consent to arbitrate, this
is conceptually misleading as compliance with these procedural steps is not a “condition
precedent” to the State parties’ consent to arbitrate. The State’s consent has been given in
Article VII, and it became effective, and as such unconditional, as soon as the Treaty entered
into force; there is nothing conditional about it. It is another matter that, in order for the
investor to be in a position to invoke the State’s consent to arbitrate in Article VII, it must
first take the procedural steps set out in that Article. An investor taking these steps in order
to be able to invoke the State’s consent does not affect the consent itself in any way; it only
affects the investor’s right to invoke it. In other words, Article VII regulates the procedure
for invoking consent; it does not condition the State’s consent. If anything, it rather
“conditions” the investor’s right to invoke the State’s consent. The Kili¢ majority appears
to have based its approach on a contractual analogy which, as noted above, is both
conceptually inaccurate and legally incorrect. An arbitration agreement included in a
contract and an arbitration agreement construed on the basis of a unilateral consent of the
State, as expressed in an investment treaty, and the investor’s subsequent invocation of that
consent after the dispute has arisen, are two very different types of agreements. While the
former is based on privity, the latter is construed after the fact, once the dispute has arisen,
and therefore effectively constitutes a hybrid between an arbitration agreement based on

privity and an arbitration agreement based on a compromis.

The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility
is often a fine one, and reasonable arbitrators may reasonably disagree on how it should be
made and in particular, on how it should be applied in a particular case.*! In the

circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to seek to address, or to

8! Thus the Ki/i¢ annulment committee noted, when declining to annul the Kilig Award, that a determination of

whether a particular objection constitutes an objection to jurisdiction or admiss

 

ility is not a basis for annulment:

“Faced with the same question, other tribunals have decided differently on questions of jurisdiction and admissibility;
it is not for the Committee to favor one or the other of these positions.” (Ki/ig Annulment Decision, para. 166.)

78

distinguish on the facts (which would not be even possible, given the issue is one of
characterization and as such a matter of law rather than one of application of a legal category
to the facts of the case), all the legal authorities cited by the Kili¢ tribunal in support of its
reasoning, or the authorities cited by the Respondent in support of its own position. It merely
notes that that there are two strands of investment treaty jurisprudence on the issue, one of
which it considers more persuasive.*? The Tribunal limits itself to quoting one authority,
with which it broadly agrees (even though it addresses the issue from the perspective of

finality of the award rather than from the perspective of characterization):

“[T]he nub of the classification problem is whether the success of the objection
necessarily negates consent to the forum. Our lodestar takes the form of a
question: is the objecting party taking aim at the tribunal or at the claim? [...]
Following the lodestar will make it easy to classify objections in many cases, and
should make it easier in all. Timeliness issues, or conditions precedent such as
participating in a conciliation attempt, pose no problem. [...] To understand
whether a challenge pertains to jurisdiction or admissibility, one should imagine
that it succeeds:

- If the reason for such an outcome would be that the claim could not be brought
to the particular forum seized, the issue is ordinarily one of jurisdiction and
subject to further recourse.

If the reason would be that the claim should not be heard at all (or at least not
yet), the issue is ordinarily one of admissibility and the tribunal’s decision is
final.”

246. In the present case, the Respondent’s objection that the Claimant has failed to comply with
the domestic litigation requirement is an objection to admissibility in the sense that, if
successful, the claim could “not be heard at all (or at least not yet),” i.e., until the Claimant
has taken the necessary procedural steps and complied with the domestic litigation

requirement. Conversely, the Respondent’s objection could not be an objection to

82 Indeed, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to engage in a detailed analysis of these two strands of
jurisprudence, other than those cited in Kilig (which are before it), as all of the relevant jurisprudence is not before it:
the Respondent mainly cited jurisprudence supporting its position, whereas the Claimant cited none.

 

83 Jan Paulsson, Jurisdiction and Admissibility, in Gerald Aksen et al, Global Reflections on International Law,
Commerce and Dispute Resolution, pp. 616-17 (cited in Kilig Award, Exhibit RA-314, para. 6.3.8) (emphasis in
original).

jurisdiction since, if successful, it would not have prevented the Claimant from re-submitting
the claim to another tribunal established under the BIT, once it had complied with the
domestic litigation requirement. In other words, the issue is not whether the claim falls
within the scope of the Treaty, but whether the proper procedure has been followed to submit

the claim to a tribunal established under the Treaty.*+

247. The Tribunal concludes by a majority that the “provided that, if’ clause establishes a
procedural requirement that relates to the admissibility of the claim rather than the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction.

5.2. Are the Claimant’s claims inadmissible for failure to comply with the domestic
litigation requirement in Article VII(2) of the BIT?

248. Having determined that Article VII(2) of the BIT sets out an admissibility requirement, the
Tribunal must consider whether the Claimant’s claims are admissible. In this connection,
the Tribunal notes that there is no dispute between the Parties, and the Claimant does not
deny that it never submitted the dispute to the Turkmen courts. Indeed, the Claimant argues
that doing so would have been futile. In accordance with its decision above, the Tribunal
will consider this issue, and the Parties’ arguments, as ones pertaining to the admissibility

of the claims rather than to the issue of jurisdiction.

5.2.1 The Claimant’s position

249. The Claimant takes the view that even if Article VII(2) of the BIT is found to impose a
mandatory domestic litigation requirement, it should not be held to the requirement as

recourse to the Turkmen courts would have been futile.

 

84 Mr Paulsson’s further point as to whether decisions on admissibility should be reviewable is essentially a matter of
interpretation of Art. 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention (manifest excess of powers). This issue is not relevant for
the purposes of the present decision, and the Tribunal merely notes that “finality” for purposes of reviewability is not
the same issue as “finality” in terms of whether the same claim may be submitted to another treaty tribunal once the
admissibility requirements have been met. If there is no jurisdiction (i.e., if the claim does not fall within the scope
of the treaty), it cannot; if the claim is merely inadmissible, it can be.

It argues first that it is well-established in international law that a claimant does not need to
comply with a domestic litigation requirement if doing so would be futile, and relies in this
respect on the 1903 Selwyn Case.*° According to the Claimant, this “futility exception”
should be applied in the present case “regardless of its relevancy with the exhaustion of local
remedies principle derived from [...] customary international law,” and in particular in light
of the “serious risk” the Claimant would face under Article VII(2) of the BIT of losing its
right to resort to arbitration if it submits the dispute to the domestic Turkmen courts and they
issue a final decision within a year.*° On this basis, the Claimant distinguishes the present
case from the Emilio Augustin Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain and Siemens A.G. v. Argentine
Republic decisions relied upon by the Respondent, which dealt with provisions allowing
investors to resort to arbitration after complying with a domestic litigation requirement, even

if the domestic courts render a decision.

The Claimant contends that resorting to the Turkmen courts would be futile, as they lack
independence and are influenced by the Turkmen Government. In support of its position, it
relies on reports and other documents from various international sources, including the
United States Department of State and the United Nations Human Rights Committee.*’ It
also relies on the testimony of another Turkish investor in Turkmenistan, Mr Hiiseyin

retaliation for a lawsuit he initiated before the Turkmen courts contesting a tax fine, which
itself was allegedly rejected without the judges considering the arguments or evidence

submitted.

The Claimant also argues that its own experiences, and those of other Turkish investors,

show that Turkmen courts do not conduct proceedings in a fair manner. During the period

The Claimant argues that, had it submitted its claims to Turkmen courts, decisions would
have been rendered within a year, and it would have lost its right to submit the dispute to

arbitration under the BIT.

5.2.2 The Respondent’s position

The Respondent counters that the domestic litigation requirement in Article VII(2) of the

BIT cannot be avoided on the basis of the alleged futility of resorting to the Turkmen courts.

First, it argues that the BIT does not provide for a futility exception. The exception relied
on by the Claimant originates from a rule of exhaustion of local remedies in customary
international law on diplomatic protection. The BIT, however, does not require exhaustion
of local remedies, and is a lex specialis which displaces inconsistent rules of customary
international law. Importing the futility exception would amount to re-writing the BIT, and

thus “would constitute an error of law and a manifest excess of powers [by the Tribunal].”*?

Second, the Respondent contends that even if a futility exception could be applied under the
BIT, the test for futility that should be applied is the “very stringent” test of “‘unavailability’
or ‘obvious futility,” which requires that a domestic remedy be “patently unavailable’ or
‘completely ineffective.” As part of this test, the Claimant must specifically show the
futility of resorting to the Turkmen courts “for the specific purpose of resolving ‘disputes

arising under the [...] BIT.””?!

According to the Respondent, this test would not be met in the present case. It contends that
the Claimant’s description of the Turkmen legal system as lacking independence is
inaccurate and based on generalized allegations. In particular, it argues that it does not take
into account considerable improvements that have been made since the country’s
independence, and that the principle of judicial independence and the rights to a fair trial

and due process are set out in the Arbitrazh Procedural Code, the Turkmen Law on Courts,

and the Turkmen Constitution.°? The Respondent also points to a 2012 mutual legal
assistance treaty between Turkey and Turkmenistan, which, in its view, constitutes an

affirmation by Turkey of the legitimacy of legal proceedings in Turkmenistan.”*

258. With respect to the Claimant’s allegations that it experienced denials of justice before the
Turkmen courts, the Respondent argues that they are not supported by the evidence. In
particular, it refers to evidence allegedly showing that the representatives acting on behalf

of the Claimant were, contrary to its assertions, authorized to do so by the Claimant.”*

259. Finally, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s failure to even attempt to submit the

present dispute to the Turkmen courts is fatal to its futility argument.

5.2.3. The Tribunal’s analysis

260. The Claimant raises a variety of arguments in support of its contention that the submission
of the dispute to Turkmen courts would have been “futile,” including the alleged unfairness
of the proceedings and lack of independence of Turkmen courts. The Tribunal has
considered the Claimant’s allegations and evidence, but is unable to accept its argument in
the broad terms it has been presented, including for lack of adequate evidence.” In any
event, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the BIT does not provide for any “futility
exception” to the local litigation requirement in Article VII(2) of the BIT. Any claim arising
out of the alleged inadequacy of the local legal system would have to be pursued as a denial
of justice claim, which does allow a party to dispense with the requirement to exhaust local

remedies in circumstances in which recourse to such remedies would be demonstrably futile.

However, the Claimant has not even attempted to submit the dispute to local courts. There

can be no denial of justice where there has been no legal process in the first place.

The Tribunal also agrees with the Respondent that the local litigation requirement in the BIT
is not a reflection or incorporation of a rule of customary international law, but rather a lex
specialis, a treaty provision specifically agreed by the State parties to the Treaty. However,
while the Tribunal has held above that Article VII(2) must be interpreted so as to contain a
domestic litigation requirement, it has also determined that this requirement is not a
jurisdictional requirement but relates to the admissibility of the claim. As a result, the
consequences of the Claimant’s non-compliance with the domestic litigation requirement

must be determined in light of the procedural nature of the requirement.

In this connection, the Tribunal notes that local court proceedings have indeed been
conducted in the context of the present dispute, as summarized above.” Moreover, although
the proceedings were brought by the Contracting Parties (and, in some instances, the General
Prosecutor’s Office of Turkmenistan)” and not by the Claimant, the fact remains that
essential aspects of the dispute have in fact been submitted to and litigated before the
Turkmen courts, with the result that seven out of the thirteen contracts at issue in this
arbitration, including all those that were still ongoing at the time, were terminated (or their
termination was upheld). The Tribunal also notes that all of these proceedings have been
completed, and indeed they were all completed within a few weeks from their filing. While
it is unclear, in light of the evidence before the Tribunal, whether the Claimant failed to
effectively participate in some of these proceedings because it was not properly notified, or
because it did not have sufficient time to prepare its defense, or for other reasons, the
Tribunal finds that it would be inappropriate, in the circumstances, to require that the

Claimant subsequently commence further court proceedings under the relevant Contracts,

 

s from the reasoning in paragraphs 262-263, which reflect the views of the majority of the

Tribunal. See Partially Dissenting Opinion of Professor Sands.

seeking relief thereunder and/or under the Treaty, given that the Contracts at issue had
already been terminated by Turkmen courts. In other words, the subject matter, or the
fundamental basis, of the dispute had already been litigated “before the courts of justice of

the Party that is a party to the dispute.”°*

In light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that it would not be appropriate now to require
that the Claimant first submit the present dispute to local courts, given that the Contracting
Parties and/or the General Prosecutor have already had recourse to the local courts, and
given that all of the still ongoing contracts have been terminated by Turkmen courts.
Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s claims must be considered admissible
in the circumstances. This finding is without prejudice to the Tribunal’s determination as to
whether the Claimant’s claims should be characterized as treaty claims or contract claims,

which is a separate issue and will be addressed in Section 5.4 below.

In view of this finding, the Tribunal need not consider the Claimant’s argument that it should
be allowed to rely on the MEN clause in Article II(2) of the BIT to circumvent the domestic

litigation requirement.

Has the Claimant made an “investment” within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and Article I(2) of the BIT?

5.3.1 The Respondent’s position

The Respondent contends that the Claimant must meet the “double keyhole” test of showing
that it has made an “investment” under both Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article

(2) of the BIT, and that it has failed to satisfy either part of the test.

5.3.1.1 Article 25 of the ICSID Convention

According to the Respondent, the criteria set out by the tribunal in Salini Costruttori S.p.A.

and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco (“Salini’”) “constitute cumulative

°8 Art. VII(2) of the BIT.

requirements or ‘essential characteristics’ that must be present for an ‘investment’ to qualify
as such under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.”!™ Therefore, in order to show that it
has made an “investment” under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Claimant must
show (1) that it took on an investment risk; (2) that it made a contribution to Turkmenistan;
(3) that its alleged investment was of a certain minimum duration; and (4) that its alleged

investment made a contribution to Turkmenistan’s economic development.

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s activities in Turkmenistan do not meet any of

these criteria.

First, the Claimant did not take on any investment risk, as its compensation under the
Contracts did not depend even in part on the operation of the facilities they related to. The

Contracts were therefore “free-standing”!°!

construction contracts, lacking any investment
risk on the part of the Claimant. The various risks which the Claimant alleges it undertook
under the Contracts, such as the risk of accident or damage to property, unspecified risks
relating to the duration of the Contracts, the risk that the Respondent’s authorities would
unilaterally alter or terminate the Contract, or the risk of expropriation of the Claimant’s
machinery and equipment, are all ordinary commercial, legal, or political risks which do not

qualify as investment risks under the Salini test.

Second, the Claimant did not make any contributions to Turkmenistan, as “free-standing”
construction contracts of the kind concluded by the Claimant “do not entail
contributions.”!©? In particular, “the mere allocation of resources [such as employees and
equipment] to the performance of contractual obligations does not constitute a
contribution.” In addition, the Claimant did not make any contribution of “know-how,”

as there was no “actual transfer of intellectual property or technology to the host State.”!*

Contrary to the Claimant’s arguments, the advance payments under the Contracts, as well

as the bank guarantees it had to provide, also did not constitute contributions.

Third, the Respondent contends that, in assessing whether the minimum duration for an

investment under the Salini test, which is “2 to 5 years,”!

is met in this case, the Tribunal
should take into account the contractually specified durations of the Contracts, which were
all under two years, with the exception of one which had a duration of exactly two years.
Even taking into account warranties and extensions, the durations of all the Contracts were
under four years, and therefore fell into what the Respondent considers to be the “gray area”
under the Salini test.'°° If it takes into account these longer “total” durations, the Tribunal
should in any event assess the duration criterion of the Salini test in light of the other criteria

107

to reveal the “true nature of the operation, and find that the duration criterion has not

been met.

Fourth, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s activities did not contribute to
Turkmenistan’s economic development, as they did not have the “productive purposes” or
provide the “large-scale benefits” to the development of the host State mentioned in the
objectives of the World Bank and the Operational Regulations of the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency, which should both “inform the meaning of the notion of contribution to
the host State’s development” under the Salini test.!°° The Respondent further alleges that
Mr ickale recognized in his witness statement that the Claimant’s activities did not

contribute to Turkmenistan’s economic development.!©?

5.3.1.2. Article I(2) of the BIT

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant has failed to show that it has made an
“investment” within the meaning of Article I(2) of the BIT, which defines the term as “any

type of assets,” of which it sets out various examples.!!°

In particular, the Claimant’s claims for money and the value of contractual performance do
not constitute investments under Article I(2)(ii) of the BIT, which refers to “returns
reinvested, claims to money or any other rights to legitimate performance having a financial
value related to an investment.” First, such claims do not constitute “assets” within the
meaning of the chapeau of Article I(2) of the BIT. According to the Respondent, the term
“assets” refers to property rights, and does not include “every thing of economic value” as
alleged by the Claimant.!!! Second, the Claimant cannot show that such claims are “related

to an investment.”

In addition, contrary to the Claimant’s arguments, its “designs, projects, technical drawings
and processes and know-how” do not constitute investments under Article I(2)(iv) of the
BIT, which refers to “copyright, industrial and intellectual property rights, such as patents,
licenses, industrial designs, technical processes; as well as trademarks, so-called ‘goodwill’,
know-how and other similar rights [...].”!!? Payment for these elements was included in the
price of the Contracts, and therefore form part of the Claimant’s claims for money and the
value of performance, which do not constitute an investment. Furthermore, “know-how”
under the BIT “refers to protected knowledge, such as trade secrets, that has economic value
and may be subject to legal protection or licensing regimes,” and not to any skills that the

Claimant’s employees may have.!!?

Finally, according to the Respondent, the Claimant does not have a “business concession
[...] conferred by law or by contract” within the meaning of Article I(2)(v) of the BIT, which
requires the delegation of public functions to an investor, and an involvement on the part of
the investor in the operation of a public service or the exploitation of natural resources. The
Contracts do not entail the exercise of public functions, even though they were awarded by
means of Presidential Decrees. The Claimant also was not involved in the operation of the

facilities it built.

5.3.2. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant argues that it has made an investment within the meaning of both Article 25(1)

of the ICSID Convention and Article I(2) of the BIT.

5.3.2.1 Article 25 of the ICSID Convention

The Claimant takes the position that the criteria in the Salini test should not be applied as
strict jurisdictional requirements. It argues that in most of the relevant ICSID jurisprudence,
the criteria were used merely as “typical characteristics” or features of an investment.
Indeed, the ICSID Convention does not contain a definition of the term, and the travaux

préparatoires show that the attempts to include a fixed definition in the Convention failed.

The Claimant further argues that, in any event, the criteria in the Salini test are met in the

present case.

First, it contends that neither the ICSID Convention nor the Salini test specify the type of
risk that must be assumed by an investor, and that it is well established in ICSID
jurisprudence that construction contracts, including those which do not involve the operation
of the constructed facilities by the contractor, are considered to be investments. The
Claimant alleges that it assumed a number of major risks in relation to the Projects, including
the risks of unilateral alteration or termination of the Contracts by the Turkmen authorities,
or of expropriation of its machinery and equipment. Other risks it assumed include the risks
of extensions of time, increases in labor costs, accidents or damage to property, problems

relating to the coordination of different projects, and the one year defect liability periods.

91

280.

281.

282.

283.

284.

Second, the Claimant argues that it made substantial contributions, including by providing
the know-how of its designers, engineers, and builders, mobilizing its employees and
equipment and machinery, establishing a branch and opening bank accounts in
Turkmenistan, and providing first demand bank guarantees in consideration for advance
payments. It contends that it is well established in ICSID jurisprudence that contributions
“made in money, in kind and in industry” by construction contractors constitute substantial

contributions.

Third, with respect to duration, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal should take into
account the full duration of the Contracts, including the warranty periods, which vary from
26 to 36 months. As a result, the Contracts meet the two to five year minimum requirement

set out in the Salini test.

Fourth, according to the Claimant, the Contracts relate to important infrastructure projects
which the Respondent itself considered to be vital contributions to its economy, and many
ICSID tribunals have found that major construction projects constitute contributions to the
host State’s economic development. The Claimant further notes that, in any event, the
necessity and appropriateness of a requirement of a contribution to the host State’s economic

development has been questioned by several ICSID tribunals.

5.3.2.2 Article I(2) of the BIT

According to the Claimant, the notion of “investment” under Article 1(2) of the BIT is

defined broadly, as the provision refers to “every kind of asset.”!!*

The Claimant argues in particular that a number of its claims constitute “claims to money or
any other rights to legitimate performance having financial value related to an investment”

within the meaning of Article I(2) of the BIT, namely its claims for:

“(i) payment for the major construction works, (ii) payment of the cost of additional works
undertaken upon the request of Respondent, (iii) compensation for losses incurred as a
result of delays attributable to Respondent, (iv) payment of interest and banking

287.

commissions accrued on the loans which were taken out due to delayed payments during
the execution of the Construction Contracts, (v) damages and losses for the wrongful
encashment by Respondent of several bank guarantees, and (vi) the return of its
machinery and equipment that were illegally confiscated [...] .”''°
Contrary to the Respondent’s position, these claims are “related to an investment” as they
are “directly related to [the Claimant’s] undertaken construction projects, which were
registered as investment projects in Turkmenistan pursuant to the relevant Presidential

Decrees awarding these projects to Claimant.”!!®

In addition, the Claimant contends that its “contribution in terms of [know-how], equipment
and qualified personnel,” as well as its designs and technical drawings, amount to
investments under Article I(2)(iv) of the BIT.'!” It argues that its designs and drawings “are
components of construction works assumed by Claimant,” and are therefore “industrial and
intellectual property rights.”!'® It further alleges that “[dJesigners, engineers and builders

are [...] key sources of technical expertise and know-how.”!!?

Finally, the Claimant contends that business concessions within the meaning of Article
1(2)(v) of the BIT were conferred on the Claimant through the Contracts and the Presidential
Decrees by which the Contracts were awarded to the Claimant. According to the Claimant,
“any concession granted by the law or [by] contract that entitles the investor to carry out any
activity, which creates an economic value in the host states should be considered as a
business concession.”!2° The Claimant also disputes the Respondent's assertion that it had
not taken on a public function, arguing that the Projects “directly served the development of

[the] Turkmenistan economy and [the] Turkmen people’s social and economic welfare.”!!

The Claimant further appears to argue that the Contracts should be considered to be business
concessions given that they were registered as investments pursuant to Article 19(3) of the
Turkmen Foreign Investment Law of 2008, which provides that investors shall enjoy

“concessions established by this Law” upon registration. '??

5.3.3. The Tribunal’s analysis

The Tribunal notes that, for purposes of its jurisdiction ratione materiae over the dispute, it
must be satisfied that the Claimant has made an “investment” within the meaning of Article
25 of the ICSID Convention and Article I(2) of the BIT. The Tribunal agrees with the Parties
that the Salini tribunal’s decision provides a useful starting point in this determination. The

relevant passage in the Salini tribunal’s decision is worth quoting:

“The doctrine generally considers that investment infers: contributions, a certain
duration of performance of the contract and a participation in the risks of the transaction
[...]. In reading the Convention’s preamble, one may add the contribution to the
economic development of the host State of the investment as an additional condition.

In reality, these various elements may be interdependent. Thus, the risks of the
transaction may depend on the contributions and the duration of performance of the
contract. As a result, these various criteria should be assessed globally even if, for the
sake of reasoning, the Tribunal considers them individually here.”'?
The Tribunal agrees that the three criteria identified by the Salini tribunal — contribution of
capital, certain duration and assumption of risk — are not independent or free-standing
criteria but interdependent in the sense that a commitment of capital to a business venture —
“contribution” of capital — implies, in itself, a certain duration for the contribution in
question and a risk of loss of the capital contributed. Such a venture need not be
incorporated, although it may be, and indeed participation in an incorporated business
venture is expressly mentioned in the BIT as the first example in a non-exhaustive list of

what may constitute an “investment” under the BIT.'* The required capital contribution

293.

may be made in different forms, including in the form of any of the assets listed in Article

1(2) of the BIT.

The Tribunal is less convinced that contribution to the economic development of the host
State should be considered an element of the definition of investment, either under Article
25 of the ICSID Convention or Article I(2) of the BIT. While the Preamble of the ICSID
Convention does mention “the need for international cooperation for economic
development, and the role of private international investment therein” as one of the aims of
the Convention, it cannot be inferred from this general aim that each and every private
foreign investment must, on its own, make a significant or even measurable contribution to
the economic development of the economy of the host State. Such contribution — which
should not be confused with the contribution of capital to a business venture, which is part
and indeed forms the core of the definition of “investment” — is rather the role of foreign
private investment as a whole, or in aggregate, which is indeed what the Preamble provides,
when read with care (“the role of private international investment therein,” i.e., in the
economic development of the host State). The Preamble does not refer to any particular

individual investment; it refers to the activity of private international investment as a whole.

The Tribunal notes that it is undisputed in the present case that the Claimant opened a branch
office in Turkmenistan in 2004 and subsequently, during the period between 2005 and 2009,
engaged in fifteen construction projects in the country. The Claimant alleges that the total
value of these projects, including the Projects at issue in this arbitration, amounted to over
USD 160 million and EUR 147 million. The Claimant also alleges that it imported
machinery and equipment into Turkmenistan with a total value of approximately
USD 14 million. The Respondent does not appear to specifically dispute these amounts,
however the Tribunal’s determination of whether an investment has been made in the present
case does not turn on the precise value of the Contracts or the amount of the Claimant’s
expenditures, but rather on whether the Claimant made a capital contribution to the venture

in question.

The Tribunal finds that the Claimant effectively established a business venture in

Turkmenistan in 2004, by way of opening a branch office and engaging in a series of

95

5.4

294.

295.

125

substantial construction projects. Although the Claimant’s business venture in
Turkmenistan was not incorporated, it certainly could have been, in view of its duration and
the number and the scale of the projects, and the need for their management and
coordination. The evidence also shows that the Claimant has committed significant assets
of its own, in the form of money, machinery and equipment, to perform the Projects. In the
circumstances, the Tribunal does not find it appropriate to consider each of the Contracts
concluded by the Claimant individually when determining whether the Claimant has made
an “investment” in Turkmenistan; they form part of a whole, which is the Claimant’s
business venture in Turkmenistan. In view of the scale, duration and number of the projects,
and the commitment of capital by the Claimant in their performance, the Tribunal concludes
that the Claimant must be considered to have made an “investment” in Turkmenistan within

the meaning of both Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article I(2) of the BIT.

Are the Claimant’s claims treaty claims or contract claims?

5.4.1 The Respondent’s position

The Respondent argues that it is widely recognized that tribunals constituted under
investment treaties do not have jurisdiction over purely contractual claims, unless expressly
provided for. In the present case, the claims advanced by the Claimant “do not truly
constitute violations [of the BIT],” but rather “stem from differences over the contracting
parties’ interpretation and enforcement of their rights and obligations under the terms of the

99125

[C]ontracts, and therefore should be submitted to the Arbitration Court, in accordance

with the dispute resolution provisions of the Contracts.

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal, in deciding whether it has jurisdiction, cannot
rely on the Claimant’s characterization of its claims, but must objectively assess whether the
“fundamental basis of the claims” is the BIT or the Contracts.!”° Given that the merits have

been fully briefed in this case, the Claimant is not entitled to any deference or benefit of the

Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 231, 233.

doubt as to the basis of its claims, and the Tribunal may look to all of the evidence and

pleadings submitted by the Parties, including as to the merits.

According to the Respondent, the Tribunal must assess whether it has jurisdiction over each

claim individually.

It argues first that many of the Claimant’s claims are “patently contractual disputes on their
face,”!? including the Claimant’s claims (1) that it is entitled to compensation for additional
work which the State Expert Review and other regulatory authorities required it to perform,
which depends on whether or not the Claimant bore the risk of regulatory requirements under
the Contracts; (2) that delay penalties were improperly applied against it, which would have
to be decided on the basis of the contractual provisions on penalties; (3) that the Contracting
Parties began operating certain facilities before handover under the Contracts, which would
have to be decided in accordance with the relevant contractual provisions; (4) that certain
Contracts were wrongfully terminated, which depends on whether the terminations were
justified under the Contracts; (5) that the Contracting Parties improperly called on bank
guarantees, which depends on the relevant terms of the Contracts and of the guarantees; (6)
that the amendment of the contractual financing provisions was imposed on the Claimant,
which should be addressed in the contractually agreed forum; and (7) that the Claimant’s
equipment in Turkmenistan was attached or blocked in Turkmenistan as a result of
attachment proceedings initiated by the Contracting Parties to recoup unpaid delay penalties,

which depends on whether the penalties imposed were justified under the Contracts.

Other claims advanced by the Claimant, do not, in the Respondent’s view, find “any support
in fact or law,” and merely “purport to implicate sovereign authority,” such that they should

be “dismissed as frivolous.”!7

First, the Claimant’s claims that the President’s approval was required for every payment
made to it after the abolishment of the State Fund, leading to delays in payment, and that it

was entitled to expect that the State Fund would be replaced by a similar fund, have no basis

'28 Respondent’s Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 245.

301.

302.

as there was never any such requirement for presidential approval or any obligation to
replace the State Fund. Second, the Claimant’s claim that the Tax Office improperly froze
its accounts is unsupported by any evidence that the Tax Office committed any improper
acts or violated the Tax Code, or that the Claimant suffered any adverse effects. Third, the
Claimant’s claims that it was not notified or allowed to defend itself in several hearings
before the Turkmen courts are false, as it was represented by authorized representatives.
Fourth, the Claimant’s claims that its employees were harassed by the Turkmen authorities
are unsupported by documentary evidence. Fifth, the Claimant has failed to show that any
late registration by the Turkmen authorities of the annexes to the Contracts was caused by a

sovereign act or omission, and not the Claimant’s own oversight.

Finally, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal should give effect to the forum selection
clauses in the Contracts, which require the submission of disputes arising from the Contracts
to the Turkmen courts. The Tribunal should therefore decline jurisdiction over claims

arising from the Contracts.

5.4.2 The Claimant’s position

In response to the Respondent’s objection as to the nature of the claims in this arbitration,
the Claimant argues that “[t]here is well established doctrine and [investment arbitration]
case law in which tribunals held that a claim should not be deprived of treaty protections
just because it relates to an investment made on the basis of a contract,” or because an alleged
breach of a treaty also amounts to a breach of contract.'?? The Claimant further argues that
the Tribunal should, for the purposes of jurisdiction, defer to the Claimant’s own

characterization of its claims.

According to the Claimant, its claims “directly arise from the acts and omissions of [the]
Respondent which resulted in unjust state intervention and violated the BIT.”!°° The

Respondent “directly intervened” in the Claimant’s projects “through its various State

authorities,” and actions taken by the Contracting Parties were in fact “triggered by way of

instructions given by various State Authorities.”!7!

303. In particular, the Claimant argues that:

e The Respondent intervened in the Claimant’s investments by abolishing the State
Fund, which was responsible for making payments under the Contracts, by means of
a Presidential Decree,'*? and by requiring subsequent payments to be individually

authorized by the President of Turkmenistan;

e After the abolition of the State Fund, the Respondent forced the Claimant to agree to
less favorable payment terms under the Contracts, which had serious financial
consequences for the Claimant; the Claimant was, in this respect, discriminated
against, as another contractor on the Avaza Canal Project continued to benefit from an

unchanged payment mechanism;

e The Respondent’s regulatory authorities delayed in approving and registering the
Technical Annexes to the Contracts, which prevented the Claimant from completing

the Projects on time;

e The State Expert Review demanded additional works outside the scope of the
Contracts, namely an increase in the surface areas of some of the Projects and a change
of the site of one of the Projects. In respect of the Avaza Canal Project, the State
Expert Review also demanded additional machinery and equipment, additional piles,

and an increase in the width of the canal;

e The President of Turkmenistan, acting through the Council of Ministers, decided on

the Claimant’s requests for extensions of time, which were “useless and not in favour

of Claimant.”!** In addition, despite the extensions of time granted, the Claimant was

charged with delay penalties on the instructions of the Council of Ministers;

The Contracting Parties in some Projects took possession of the works and transferred
them to the State authorities for which they were built before the State Acceptance
Committee had signed the handover minutes, as required by the handover procedure
under the Contracts. In addition, the State Acceptance Committee abused its power
by failing to sign the handover minutes even though the works were completed,

preventing the Claimant from receiving the relevant progress payments;

The Contracting Parties’ unjust termination of some of the Contracts was in fact

instructed by the Cabinet of Ministers;

The Respondent “unduly encashed”'** the advance payment guarantees provided by

the Claimant under the Contracts;

The Claimant’s machinery and equipment was confiscated by the Respondent on the
basis of unjust decisions by the Turkmen courts imposing delay penalties against the

Claimant;

The blocking of the Claimant’s bank accounts by the Turkmen tax authorities due to
a failure to make the required VAT payments in relation to the Contracts was contrary
to a Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers which provided that the Contracting Parties

were solely responsible for making those payments; and that

The Turkmen authorities coerced and harassed the Claimant’s employees through
arbitrary measures and threats, including unjust detention, raids by the Turkmen

police, and the termination of travel visas and work permits.

304. The Claimant’s various claims are each summarized in more detail in Section 7 and 8 below

on the merits.

The Claimant also appears to argue that actions by the State authorities of the Respondent
which are in breach of the Presidential Decrees by which the Projects were awarded to the

Claimant amount to breaches of the BIT.

5.4.3. The Tribunal’s analysis

The Tribunal notes that its jurisdiction is limited to claims arising under the Turkey-
Turkmenistan BIT and does not extend to claims arising under the Contracts, which each
contain a dispute resolution clause referring all disputes arising thereunder to the Arbitration
Court of Turkmenistan.'*> The issue on which the Parties disagree is whether any of the
Claimant’s claims may be characterized as treaty claims, i.e., claims arising under the
Treaty, or whether they should rather be characterized as contract claims which, as such, fall

within the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court under the terms of the Contracts.

The Tribunal further notes that the Claimant has brought the present arbitration against the
State of Turkmenistan and not the Contracting Parties. Moreover, while it is undisputed that
some of the Contracting Parties are themselves State organs (specifically, the Ministry of
Economy and Finance, Ahal province, and Lepab province) and all of them may be
considered State entities in the broad sense of this term as they are owned and/or controlled
by the State, the Claimant’s claims are not directed against the Contracting Parties but
against various State organs, in particular the President of Turkmenistan, the Cabinet of
Ministers, the Supreme Chamber of Control and the Central Bank, which allegedly
repeatedly intervened in the performance of the Contracts. The Claimant specifically

confirmed this at the Hearing.!*°

In these circumstances, the issue of whether the Claimant’s claims amount to treaty claims
or contract claims does not arise as an issue of legal principle; it could only arise, as such, if
the Claimant complained of breaches of the Treaty that had allegedly been committed by

the Contracting Parties. The Tribunal will analyze the Claimant’s claims accordingly, as

135 For instance, Art. 3.3 of the Avaza Canal Contract, Exhibit R-441, provides as follows: “Should the parties fail to
reach an agreement [through amicable negotiations], disputes shall be referred to the Arbitration Court of
Turkmenistan, the decision of which shall be binding upon both parties.”

'36 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 122:16-21, 193:4-194.

101

309.

310.

claims directed against various State organs and not the Contracting Parties, even in
instances in which the Contracting Party is a State organ. To the extent that the issue arises
as to whether a particular claim is directed against a Contracting Party or a third party State
organ, or is properly to be treated as a claim under a contract rather than under the BIT, the
Tribunal will consider as necessary whether the claim in question constitutes, in substance,

a treaty claim or a contract claim in that specific context.

In this connection, the Tribunal also notes that the Contracts provided that various State
organs would play a role in the approval and performance of the Contracts. Thus, the
Contracts specifically provided that they were concluded pursuant to a decree of the
President of Turkmenistan, as their conclusion required approval by the President.'*” Each
of the Contracts also envisaged that they would enter into force from the date of their
registration with the State Commodity and Raw Materials Exchange of Turkmenistan, and
in some instances also with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which are both State

organs. '*8

They also provided that the design and construction documentation (the
“Working Project”) would be approved by the State Expert Review, or “Expertiza,”'? and

that the handover for operation would be approved by the State Acceptance Committee. '4°

Consequently, as the Contracts themselves envisaged that certain State organs would be
involved in the performance of the Contracts, such involvement cannot, without more, be
considered evidence of illegitimate State interference. The Claimant must prove that the
State organs in question went beyond the role envisaged for them in the Contracts, and that
their conduct amounted to a breach of the Treaty. The Tribunal will consider these issues

as necessary together with the merits of the Claimant’s claims.

AVAILABILITY OF THE SUBSTANTIVE PROTECTION STANDARDS
INVOKED BY THE CLAIMANT

The Claimant advances claims under the BIT alleging breaches of various substantive
protection standards, including the protections available under the fair and equitable
treatment (“FET”), full protection and security (“FPS”), non-discrimination and umbrella
clause standards, as well as protection against unlawful expropriation. The Respondent
argues, however, that with the exception of protection against unlawful expropriation, the
BIT does not contain any of these protection standards, and therefore the Claimant cannot

invoke them.

In response, the Claimant advances a number of theories on the basis of which it alleges it
can invoke the FET, FPS, non-discrimination, and umbrella clause standards. First, it argues
that it can invoke these standards by operation of the MEN clause in Article II of the BIT
and the non-derogation clause in Article VI of the BIT. Second, it argues that the Preamble
of the BIT gives rise to an FET obligation which is binding on the Respondent. Finally, it
contends that it can invoke the FET, FPS, non-discrimination, and umbrella clause
protections on the basis of Turkmenistan’s “international customary practice” of granting

these protections to foreign investors.

The Tribunal addresses each of the Claimant’s arguments in turn below.

Can the Claimant invoke the FET, FPS, non-discrimination, and umbrella clause
protections through the MFN clause in Article II of the BIT or the non-derogation
clause in Article VI of the BIT?

6.1.1 The Claimant’s position

The Claimant argues that, by operation of the MEN clause in Article II of the BIT and the
non-derogation clause in Article VI of the BIT, it can rely on the FET, FPS, non-

discrimination and umbrella clause protections set out in other bilateral investment treaties

103

concluded by Turkmenistan, including those with Egypt,'*! Bahrain,'*? and the United

Kingdom.'?

315. According to the Claimant, the term “treatment” in Articles II and VI of the BIT, when
interpreted in good faith under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, should be understood
to cover at least the substantive protections provided to other foreign investors. In support
of its position, the Claimant relies on the tribunal’s prima facie determination on the issue
in Bayinair v. Pakistan,“ as well as in Rumeli v. Kazakhstan, in which the tribunal accepted
an agreement by the parties that the FET standard could be imported from another bilateral

investment treaty on the basis of an MFN clause.'*>

It further argues that any matters,
including substantive protections, which are not expressly excluded from the scope of the

MEN clause in Article II(4) of the BIT, should be considered to be within its scope.

316. The Claimant also asserts that there is no legal basis for the Respondent’s argument that an
attempt to import an umbrella clause through an MFN clause would be impermissible
because it would constitute a dramatic expansion of the State’s obligations. It argues that
the various cases relied on by the Respondent are inapposite, as they only address the issue
of whether a contractual claim can be elevated to an investment claim. The Claimant relies

instead on EDF v. Argentina, in which the tribunal allowed the claimants to invoke an MFN

clause to rely on the umbrella clauses in two other bilateral investment treaties concluded

by the host State.!4°

In response to the question raised by the Tribunal after the Hearing as to the interpretation
and application of the term “similar situations” in Article II(2) of the BIT, and its impact on
the meaning and effect of the provision, the Claimant argues that “the application of the
‘similar situation’ test in practice works differently depending on what claimants are seeking
from the MEN clause.”!47 According to the Claimant, in situations in which claimants have
merely invoked the MFN clause to attract the benefits of substantive protections available
under other investment treaties between the host State and third States, “tribunals have been
satisfied with the fact that claimant qualifies as an ‘investor’ under the basic treaty and have
not gone into actually comparing the investor with another foreign investor from a third

country.”

6.1.2 The Respondent’s position

The Respondent disputes that the Claimant can rely on either Article II or Article VI of the

BIT to import substantive protections from other bilateral investment treaties.

The Respondent argues in particular that Article VI of the BIT is not a type of supplementary
MEN clause, as the Claimant appears to contend, but rather a non-derogation clause aimed
at managing conflicts between treaties. It cannot be read to impose any additional

substantive obligations on the host State.

As to the MEN clause in Article II of the BIT, the Respondent takes the position that it was
not designed or intended to import substantive protections from other bilateral investment

treaties.

According to the Respondent, in order to show a breach of the MEN clause, the Claimant
must demonstrate two elements, namely (1) that more favorable treatment was accorded to
investments of nationals or investors from countries other than Turkey; and (2) that these
investments were in a “similar situation” to the Claimant’s investments in Turkmenistan.
The Respondent contends that the Claimant would have to identify “an actual investment of
an actual investor, in an actual ‘similar situation,’ who is actually receiving the allegedly
more favorable treatment.”'*? In other words, the purpose of Article II(2) is to “address
actual measures taken by the host State vis-a-vis the investments.”!°° According to the
Respondent, the relevant factors to be taken into account in such a comparative, fact-based
analysis of investments of investors that are in “like circumstances” are “(i) whether the
investors are similarly situated, in like circumstances; (ii) whether the treatment accorded to
the host State’s national or third State’s national was in fact more favorable than that of the
[C]laimant; (iii) whether the difference was based on or caused by nationality; and (iv)
whether there was an objective, rational basis or policy justifying the difference in

treatment.”!>!

Had the State parties intended to allow the importation of substantive protections through
the MEN clause, they would not have included the “in similar situations” requirement and
instead would have included broader language, such as a reference to “all matters” or an
express reference to “treaty obligations,” as contained in the MEN clause at issue in the

Ambatielos case or that contained in the Energy Charter Treaty.!>?

The Respondent further argues that even if the MFN clause in Article II of the BIT could be
used to import provisions from other treaties, it cannot be used to import substantive
protections which are “completely absent” from the BIT.'** In support of its position, the

Respondent relies inter alia on the award in Hochtief v. Argentina, in which the tribunal

determined that the MEN clause at issue in that case was applicable only to the exercise of
rights which already existed under the treaty in which the clause was contained.'** It also
argues that the tribunal’s findings in the Bayindir v. Pakistan case relied on by the Claimant
have not been followed in subsequent arbitral awards. In addition, contrary to the Claimant’s
position, the carve-outs listed in Article II(4) of the BIT relating to customs unions and
taxation agreements do not constitute an exhaustive list of exclusions that permit the
application of MFN treatment to everything else. Citing the Kilig decision, the Respondent
argues that the limitations in Article II(4) of the BIT “are addressed toward specific third-
party agreements” and are not relevant for the interpretation of the term “treatment” in the

MEN clause.!*°

According to the Respondent, importing an umbrella clause through the MFN clause would
be a particularly dramatic expansion of the State’s consent to arbitration in the BIT, as
umbrella clauses can substantially expand the scope of application of an investment treaty.
Relying in particular on Noble Ventures v. Romania,'*® the Respondent argues that arbitral
tribunals have therefore taken a cautious approach to such clauses, requiring that the wording
of a treaty show a clear intention to conclude an umbrella clause. This cautious approach
should apply with even greater force to attempts to import such clauses through MFN

clauses. Relying inter alia on Salini v. Jordan,'*"

the Respondent adds that arbitral tribunals
have generally declined to import provisions by means of an MFN clause that significantly
extends the scope of their jurisdiction to issues not covered by the applicable arbitration

clause.

The Respondent further contends that the Claimant has not identified an applicable treaty
standard on which it can rely. Instead of relying on a single treaty that it deems to be “most

favorable,” the Claimant relies on a patchwork of treaties which would not represent

treatment granted to investors from any specific country. In any event, the treaties relied on
by the Claimant do not provide a “more favorable” standard of treatment. In particular,
Turkmenistan’s bilateral investment treaty with the United Kingdom does not provide

investors with recourse to ICSID arbitration in the absence of a separate agreement of the

158 159

parties,'°* its treaty with Egypt only provides for UNCITRAL arbitration,’°’ and its treaty
with Bahrain, which was signed only in 2011 after this arbitration was initiated, states that

it does not apply to disputes arising before its entry into force.'°

6.1.3. The Tribunal’s analysis

The Claimant seeks to import the FET, FPS, non-discrimination and umbrella clause
protections from other investment treaties concluded by Turkmenistan with third States on
the basis of Article II(2) and Article VI of the BIT. Article II(2) of the BIT, which forms
part of a broader provision headed “Promotion and Protection of Investments,” provides as

follows:

“Each Party shall accord to these investments [i.e., investments permitted into its
territory pursuant to Article II(1)], once established, treatment no less favourable than
that accorded in similar situations to investments of its investors or to investments of
investors of any third country, whichever is the most favourable.”'®!
The provision thus establishes a requirement of both national treatment (“investments of its
investors”) and MEN treatment (“investments of investors of any third country”). In support
of its argument that it may rely on substantive protection standards not specifically included
in the BIT, the Claimant relies on the MFN treatment clause. The Respondent argues that

the MEN clause does not allow such “importation,” and that in any event the scope of
application of the clause is limited to “similar situations.” According to the Respondent,

this limitation makes it clear that the determination of whether the investor is entitled to rely

329.

on the MFN clause requires a comparative, fact-based analysis of investments of investors

that are in “like circumstances.”

The Tribunal has carefully considered the meaning and effect of the MFN clause in Article
II(2) of the BIT, in light of the general rule of treaty interpretation in Article 31 of the Vienna
Convention. The ordinary meaning of the terms of the MEN clause, when read in their
context and in light of the object and purpose of the Treaty, suggests that each State party to
the Treaty agreed to treat investments made in its territory by investors of the other State
party in a manner that is no less favorable than the treatment they accord in similar situations
to investments by investors of any third State. Thus the legal effect of the MFN clause,
properly interpreted, is to prohibit discriminatory treatment of investments of investors of a
State party (the home State) in the territory of the other State (the host State) when compared
with the treatment accorded by the host State to investments of investors of any third State.
However, this obligation exists only insofar as the investments of the investors of the home
State and those of the investors of the third State can be said to be in “a similar situation.”
Conversely, the MEN treatment obligation does not exist if and when an investment of an
investor of the home State is not in a “similar situation” to that of the investments of investors

of third States; in such a situation, there is de facto no discrimination.

The terms “treatment accorded in similar situations” therefore suggest that the MFN
treatment obligation requires a comparison of the factual situation of the investments of the
investors of the home State and that of the investments of the investors of third States, for
the purpose of determining whether the treatment accorded to investors of the home State
can be said to be less favorable than that accorded to investments of the investors of any
third State. It follows that, given the limitation of the scope of application of the MFN clause
to “similar situations,” it cannot be read, in good faith, to refer to standards of investment
protection included in other investment treaties between a State party and a third State. The
standards of protection included in other investment treaties create legal rights for the
investors concerned, which may be more favorable in the sense of being additional to the
standards included in the basic treaty, but such differences between applicable legal
standards cannot be said to amount to “treatment accorded in similar situations,” without

effectively denying any meaning to the terms “similar situations.” Investors cannot be said

109

330.

331.

to be in a “similar situation” merely because they have invested in a particular State; indeed,
if the terms “in similar situations” were to be read to coincide with the territorial scope of
application of the treaty, they would not be given any meaning and would effectively
become redundant as there would be no difference between the clause “treatment no less
favourable than that accorded in similar situations [...] to investments of investors of any
third country” and “treatment no less favourable than that accorded [...] to investments of
investors of any third country.” Such a reading would not be consistent with the generally
accepted rules of treaty interpretation, including the principle of effectiveness, or effet utile,

which requires that each term of a treaty provision should be given a meaning and effect.

As noted above, the Claimant also argues that any matters, including substantive protections,
which are not expressly excluded from the scope of the MFN clause in Article II(4) of the
BIT, should be considered to be within in its scope. The Tribunal is unable to agree with
this argument. Article II(4) of the BIT merely confirms that the provisions of Article II do

not have any effect on any agreements relating to customs unions or taxation.!°

Nor is the Tribunal able to agree with the Claimant’s argument that it can rely on Article VI
(“Derogation”) of the BIT to import substantive investment protection standards included in
other investment treaties concluded by Turkmenistan.'® Article VI does not address MFN
treatment; it merely confirms that the BIT does not derogate from any other laws,
regulations, administrative practices or procedures or adjudicatory decisions, international
law obligations or investment agreements or authorizations that entitle investments of

party to invoke such more favorable treatment accorded in other legal instruments, decisions,

or practices; it merely confirms that they are preserved and not derogated from by the BIT.

The Tribunal concludes that the Claimant’s argument that it is entitled to import substantive
standards of protection not included in the Treaty from other investment treaties concluded
by Turkmenistan, and to rely on such standards of protection in the present arbitration, must
be rejected. When including the terms “similar situations” in Article II(2) of the BIT, the
State parties must be considered to have agreed to restrict the scope of the MFN clause so
as to cover discriminatory treatment between investments of investors of one of the State
parties and those of investors of third States, insofar as such investments may be said to be
in a factually similar situation. Nor do Article II(4) or Article VI of the BIT create any such
entitlement. The Claimant is therefore only entitled to invoke those investment protection
standards specifically included in the BIT. These standards include the entitlement to MFN

treatment “in similar situations.”

Does the Preamble of the BIT give rise to a binding FET obligation?

6.2.1 The Claimant’s position

The Claimant argues that the Preamble of the BIT, according to which the Treaty was
concluded on the basis of the State parties “agreeing that fair and equitable treatment of
investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum

2165

effective utilization of economic resources, imposes an FET obligation on the

Respondent.

The Claimant further argues that it is entitled to invoke the FET standard on the basis of a
passage in an explanatory note on Article II of the BIT in Turkey’s Draft Law on Ratification
of the BIT, which states that “[e]ach Party undertakes to provide fair and equitable treatment

9166

in its territory for the investments of the other Party’s investor. According to the

'65 See the English version of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT, Exhibit C-001 (Reply).

Claimant, this passage “clearly indicates that [FET] is a binding obligation for both

Contracting States.”!°”

6.2.2 The Respondent’s position

The Respondent takes the position that it is evident on the face of the BIT that the State
parties chose not to include an FET obligation. According to the Respondent, the fact that
FET is mentioned in the Preamble as being “desirable,” but was then left out of the BIT’s
“obligatory clauses,” demonstrates that the State parties “deliberately chose not to include it
as a binding obligation.”!©* It goes on to argue that while preambles provide context for
interpreting the ordinary meaning of the treaty, they are hortatory provisions and do not

create any binding legal commitments.

The Respondent further argues that the statement in the Explanatory Note accompanying
the Turkish Draft Law on Ratification of the BIT that there is an FET obligation in Article
II of the BIT is erroneous, and that it is undisputed that there is no such obligation in Article
II. In any event, the Draft Law on Approval of Ratification of the BIT is in essence a
unilateral statement by one of the State parties and cannot be used to read such an obligation

into the Treaty.

6.2.3. The Tribunal’s analysis

It is well-established in international law, including in the jurisprudence of investment treaty
tribunals, that preambles to treaties are not an operative part of the treaty and do not create
binding legal obligations which are capable of giving rise to a distinct cause of action.'?
While a preamble may, in certain circumstances, be relied upon in treaty interpretation as
part of the context of the treaty and for the purposes of ascertaining its object and purpose,

it cannot be relied upon as a source of independent or free-standing legal rights or

obligations. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s argument that the reference in
the Preamble to the BIT to “fair and equitable treatment of investment [being] desirable”

creates a binding legal obligation on which the Claimant is entitled to rely to found a claim.

Can the Claimant invoke the FET, FPS, non-discrimination and umbrella clause
protections on the basis of Turkmenistan’s alleged “international customary practice”?

6.3.1 The Parties’ positions

The Claimant takes the position that it can invoke the FET, FPS, non-discrimination, and
umbrella clause protections as they have become “an international customary norm for

Turkmenistan.”!”°

It identifies eight bilateral investment treaties concluded by
Turkmenistan between 1994 and 2011, after the conclusion of the BIT with Turkey, all of
which contain the FET standard and some of which also contain FPS, non-discrimination
and umbrella clause standards.'7! Relying on UPS v. Canada and Merrill & Ring v. Canada,
the Claimant argues that these treaties “are the obvious facts proving that [these protections]
became an international customary norm for Turkmenistan through its State practice derived

from these [t]reaties.”!”?

The Respondent counters that the Claimant provides “no intelligible basis”!’* for arguing
that the Respondent’s customary international law obligations include FET, FPS, and
umbrella clause protections. According to the Respondent, there is “no such thing as an
‘international customary norm for Turkmenistan’ that emerges solely through one State’s
BIT practice.” In addition, Turkmenistan’s treaty practice is in any event not consistent,
general and repetitive. For instance, of the eight treaties relied on by the Claimant, only

three contain an umbrella clause. Turkmenistan also does not have any bilateral investment

treaties with most of the world’s countries, indicating that it never intended to be generally

bound by the protections invoked by the Claimant.

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant has not in any event requested the Tribunal
to find that the Respondent has breached customary international law, and that it could not

do so under the BIT.

6.3.2 The Tribunal’s analysis

The Tribunal finds no merit, legal or otherwise, in the Claimant’s argument that it is entitled
to invoke the FET, FPS, non-discrimination, and umbrella clause protections on the basis
that they have become “an international customary norm for Turkmenistan.” In any event,
even assuming the FET, FPS, non-discrimination, and umbrella clause standards were to be
considered as part of customary international law (and not only the customary international
law of, or applicable to, Turkmenistan), which is an argument neither Party has made, there
is no basis in the BIT for the Tribunal to apply any investment protection standards other
than those specifically included in the BIT. The State parties’ consent to arbitrate in Article
VII of the BIT only covers disputes arising out of an alleged breach of these specific

standards.

THE CLAIMANT’S EXPROPRIATION CLAIMS
Did the Respondent unlawfully expropriate the Claimant’s contractual rights?

TAA The Claimant’s position

The Claimant argues that the termination of some of the Contracts, “through the instructions
of [the] Cabinet of Ministers and the Decisions of the [TAC],”!”> amounts to an

expropriation of its contractual rights, in breach of Article III of the BIT.

According to the Claimant, its contractual rights qualify as investments under Article I(2)(ii)
of the BIT, which refers to “claims to money or any other rights to legitimate performance
having financial value related to an investment,” and under Article I(2)(v), which refers to

“business concessions conferred by law or by contract.”!”°

The Claimant argues in particular that the Ashgabat Cinema Contract, the Babarap Projects
Contract, and the Kipchak Cultural Center Contract were terminated by the Contracting
Parties on the instructions of the Cabinet of Ministers, as the Contracting Parties were
required to obtain the authorization of the Cabinet of Ministers for the terminations. The
Claimant relies in this respect on various letters in which the Contracting Parties sought the
authorization of the Cabinet of Ministers to terminate contracts, or in which the Cabinet of
Ministers granted such authorization.'”’ According to the Claimant, the Cabinet of Ministers
instructed the Contracting Parties to terminate the Contracts even though it was aware of the
various problems the Claimant had encountered, including the late or non-payment of the
progress payments it was owed, the Claimant’s entitlement to time extensions, and the State

Expert Review’s requests that the volume of the works be increased.

"76 See English version of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT, Exhibit C-001 (Reply). At the Hearing, the Claimant

of Ministers to TNGS dated 26 Aug. 2009, Exhibit C-135 (Reply).

115

345.

346.

348.

The Claimant further argues that the Arbitration Court’s decisions terminating the Avaza
Canal Contract, Babarap Projects Contract, Kipchak Cultural Center Contract, Ashgabat
Cinema Contract, Dayhanbank Contract, Abadan School Contract, and Abadan

Kindergarten Contract, were “manifestly unjust?!”

and a denial of justice. According to the
Claimant, the Arbitration Court “obviously disregarded the explicit facts which were in
favor of Claimant and the contractual rights of Claimant, instead rejecting all claims of the
representative of Claimant without stating any reason.”!”? The Claimant contends that the

decisions therefore constitute an expropriation of its contractual rights.

TAQ The Respondent’s position

The Respondent disputes that the Claimant’s contractual rights were expropriated as a result

of the termination of a number of the Contracts.

The Respondent first argues that the termination decisions were not “taken pursuant to
sovereign authority,”!*° but were rather taken by the Contracting Parties on the basis of
delays and failures to comply with the Work Performance Schedules. The Claimant has not
adduced any evidence that the Contracts were terminated on the instructions of the Cabinet
of Ministers. The Respondent further argues that any knowledge of, or approval by, the
Cabinet of Ministers of the Contracting Parties’ decisions to terminate the Contracts “cannot

transform those commercial acts into sovereign interference.”!*!

Indeed, as confirmed by
the Bayindir v. Pakistan case, the mere involvement of a high-level official does not

transform a commercial act into an exercise of sovereign authority.

With respect to the Claimant’s arguments that the decisions of the Arbitration Court

terminating certain Contracts amounted to expropriation, the Respondent contends that the

183

“only relevant question is whether these decisions amounted to a denial of justice.”'** The

Respondent argues, however, that the Claimant is unable to establish any denial of justice.

The Respondent further argues that, in any event, the decisions to terminate certain Contracts
“did not substantially deprive [the] Claimant of the economic substance of its projects.”!**
According to the Respondent, the decisions did not give rise to a substantial decrease in the
value of the Claimant’s investment, as it received substantial payments under most of the

terminated Contracts. As a result, the decisions cannot amount to expropriation.

7.1.3 The Tribunal’s analysis

The Claimant’s claim relating to the alleged expropriation of its contractual rights rests on
two arguments: first, that the Contracting Parties terminated the seven Contracts at issue
upon the instructions of the Cabinet of Ministers, and second, that the termination decisions
were upheld by the Arbitration Court. The Claimant’s case appears to be that the conduct
of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Arbitration Court independently amounted to

expropriation.

The relevant evidence before the Tribunal includes the letter of Mr Durdiyev, Chairman of
the State-Owned Enterprise “Turkmenneftegazstroy” (“TINGS”), to Mr Hojamuhammedov,
Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers dated 25 August 2009,'** and the reply letter
of Mr Hojamuhammedov dated 26 August 2009.'*5 The former letter states that the
Contractor (i.¢., igkale) “acts very slowly in executing constructing works” under the
relevant Contracts (namely the Babarap Projects Contract (TNG-I 8) and the Ashgabat
Cinema Contract (TNG-I 16)), that TNGS had previously “sent warnings to [the] Contractor
several times regarding the issue,” and that no action had been taken by the Contractor to

accelerate the works. TNGS therefore requested the Cabinet of Minister’s authorization to

terminate the relevant Contracts. The authorization was provided by the Cabinet of

Ministers in a brief letter the next day.'*°

The Tribunal is unable to conclude on the basis of this limited evidence, which relates only
to two of the seven Contracts at issue, that TNGS, the Contracting Party, acted upon the
instructions of the Cabinet of Ministers, or that the latter impermissibly intervened in the
performance of the Contracts.'*? On the contrary, the evidence shows that it was TNGS that
initiated the termination and sought the Cabinet of Minister’s authorization, which it
obtained. Moreover, the reasons for the termination invoked by TNGS were not unrelated
to the performance by the Claimant of its obligations under the terms of the Contracts; on
the contrary, the termination was based on igkale’s alleged non-performance under the
relevant Contracts. While the relevant Contracts did not envisage that any such
authorization was required for termination, the Tribunal is unable to conclude, on the basis
of the limited evidence before it, that the Cabinet of Minister impermissibly interfered in the

performance of the Contracts.

In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant also referred to a meeting that took place in early
July 2009 between Mr ickale and the Respondent’s Minister of Construction, Mr
Durduliyev, and to a further meeting that took place a few days later between Mr ickale and
Mr Hojamuhammedov, Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers. According to the
Claimant, Mr ickale’s account of these meetings in his witness statement shows that it was
not the Contracting Authorities but the Cabinet of Ministers that decided to terminate the
Contracts. Mr ickale states that he raised the issue of payment delays at the meetings, but
was told that he had to complete the pending projects on time, and that there would be no
further extensions. According to Mr ickale, if the works were not sped up, Mr

Hojamuhammedov stated that he would “erase” the company from Turkmenistan.!**

'86 Letter from Cabinet of Ministers to TNGS dated 26 Aug. 2009, Exhibit C-135 (Reply).

187 The Claimant also refers to a letter in which Dayhanbank informs i¢kale of the termination of the Dayhanbank
Contract “upon approval of the Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan, the Central Bank of Turkmenistan and the
Ministry of Construction of Turkmenistan.” (Letter from Dayhanbank to igkale dated 23 Sept. 2009, Exhibit BK-05.)
The letter does not, however, indicate that the Dayhanbank acted on the instructions of the Cabinet of Ministers, or
that the latter impermissibly intervened in the performance of the Contracts.

188 Witness Statement of Mr ickale, pp. 14-15.

118

354.

355.

356.

357.

Mr ickale’s account of the two meetings falls short of establishing that it was the Cabinet of
Ministers that initiated the termination of the Contracts, or that the Cabinet of Ministers
otherwise impermissibly interfered in the performance of the Contracts. The account merely
shows that the Cabinet of Ministers was concerned about the progress being made by the
Claimant on the Projects, a concern which is a contractual issue and not evidence of

impermissible governmental interference amounting to expropriation of contractual rights.

Finally, to the extent that the Claimant alleges that the proceedings before the Arbitration
Court amounted to denial of justice, the Tribunal notes that, as determined above, its
jurisdiction under the Treaty does not extend to claims for breach of the FET standard. On
the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal is also unable to find that the decisions of
the Arbitration Court, upholding the termination by the Contracting Parties of the seven
Contracts at issue, amounted in and of themselves to an expropriation of the Claimant’s
contractual rights. The decisions merely upheld the termination of the relevant Contracts by
the Contracting Parties. While such terminations may or may not have been justified under
the terms of the Contracts, the Claimant does not allege that the conduct of the Contracting

Parties themselves amounted to a breach of the Treaty, including expropriation.'*?

Did the Respondent unlawfully expropriate the Claimant’s machinery and equipment?

7.21 The Claimant’s position

The Claimant contends that the Respondent breached Article III of the BIT through
decisions of the Arbitration Court of Turkmenistan, which it alleges unjustly attached and
ordered the sale, or otherwise prevented the Claimant’s further use of, its machinery and
equipment, and by a letter issued by the Turkmen Supreme Court to the State Customs
Service prohibiting the removal from the country of all of the Claimant’s machinery and

equipment.

The Claimant argues that the Arbitration Court ordered the attachment and sale of the
Claimant’s machinery and equipment to enforce decisions it had rendered in connection with

the imposition of delay penalties which amounted to denials of justice. The Claimant in

'89 See paragraph 307 above. See also the Claimant’s PHB, paras. 361, 363 and 364.

119

particular relies on the Arbitration Court’s decision on attachment dated 18 March 2010,

enforcing a 26 November 2009 decision on the imposition of delay penalties and taxes in

relation to the Avaza Canal Project.!°°

On the basis of the decision, 23 items of the
Claimant’s machinery and equipment were allegedly attached and sold.'®! It also relies on
similar attachment decisions by the Arbitration Court enforcing decisions imposing delay
penalties under the Babarap Projects Contract, the Ashgabat Cinema Contract, and the
Kipchak Cultural Center Contract.'°* According to the Claimant, since the underlying
decisions on the imposition of delay penalties amount to denials of justice, the attachment
decisions constitute unjust actions that are “tantamount to unlawful expropriation.”!>
358. The Claimant further argues that, as a result of an indefinite prohibition imposed by the
Turkmen Supreme Court preventing the exportation of the Claimant’s machinery and
equipment, the Claimant has been unable to export and use its remaining machinery and
equipment. It alleges that the Supreme Court issued its prohibition in the form of a letter
dated 9 June 2010 to the State Customs Service directing that the Custom Service locate all
of the Claimant’s machinery and materials and prevent it from being removed from
Turkmenistan.'°* According to the Claimant, the total value of its machinery and equipment
(approximately USD 13.9 million without VAT) is far higher than the amounts of delay

penalties (approximately USD 2.8 million) which have been enforced against it through the

1° Decision of the Arbitration Court of Turkmenistan dated 18 Mar. 2010 with respect to enforcement proceedings
over the machinery and equipment of the Claimant, Exhibit C-64 (Memorial); Decision of the Arbitration Court of
Turkmenistan on Termination of Contract No. TNGIZ-I 13 dated 26 Nov. 2009, Exhibit R-480.

'9! See Summary of Records Regarding Attachment and Sale of igkale Machinery and Equipment, Exhibit R-516.

' The Claimant relies on the following attachment decisions: Decision of the Arbitration Court of Turkmenistan

Court of Turkmenistan on Changing the Method of Execution of the Court Decision regarding Contract No. TNG-I

Arbitration Court’s attachment decisions. However, despite the Claimant’s efforts,!®> the
Supreme Court has not lifted the prohibition, and in failing to do so, has acted in a manner

that lacks transparency. The prohibition therefore amounts to an unlawful expropriation.

In response to the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant has not convincingly identified
the machinery and equipment which was allegedly taken from it, the Claimant contends that
it had submitted documents showing the machinery and equipment which it had imported

into Turkmenistan,!°°

all of which was allegedly confiscated by the Respondent. It goes on
to argue that it was deprived of the opportunity to “identify in detail” the machinery and
equipment on its various construction sites, as it was prevented from entering some of

them.!°7

7.2.2. The Respondent’s position

The Respondent disputes that either the Arbitration Court’s decisions on attachment of the
Claimant’s machinery and equipment, or the prohibition imposed by the Turkmen Supreme
Court on the removal of the machinery and equipment from the country, amount to an

expropriation.

First, the Respondent notes that the Claimant does not dispute that a seizure ordered by a
domestic court will not normally qualify as a taking, and argues that that the decisions of the
Arbitration Court imposing delay penalties which underpin the Court’s attachment decisions
do not amount to denials of justice. Indeed, the Claimant has not shown that the Arbitration
Court’s decisions were “so insubstantial, or so bereft of a basis in law, that the judgements

2198

were in effect arbitrary or malicious,”’”” and it has also failed to seek appellate review of the

decisions.

364.

Second, the Respondent argues that the request by the Supreme Court in its letter dated 9
June 2010 to the State Customs Service to prevent the removal of the Claimant’s machinery
and equipment from Turkmenistan arose out of the same proceedings in which the
Contracting Parties sought to enforce delay penalties against the Claimant. Therefore, the
Claimant’s allegations that the request amounts to an expropriation must fail for the same
reasons as its allegations that the Court’s attachment decisions amount to an expropriation.
The Respondent further argues that the Claimant did not make any effort to remove its
machinery and equipment in the ten months between the Supreme Court’s letter and the
termination of the relevant Contracts, and first inquired about doing so only in January

2013,' after it had received the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial.

The Respondent also contends that, in any event, the Claimant has not adduced any evidence
that the machinery or equipment “remained in Turkmenistan under Claimant’s ownership
and possession and in good operating condition at the time of the alleged taking.””°° The
customs documents and internal invoices that the Claimant relies on do not show whether
the machinery and equipment was ever delivered, and whether it was subsequently removed

201

or damage In addition, the evidence shows that after 2009 the Claimant’s remaining

representatives disposed of some of the machinery and equipment.

7.2.3. The Tribunal’s analysis

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the evidence relied upon by the Claimant in support of
its claim of expropriation of its equipment and machinery in order to determine whether it
establishes (1) that the equipment and machinery which was allegedly expropriated has been
properly identified; (2) that the equipment and machinery in question has been taken as a

result of the decisions of the Arbitration Court and the Supreme Court’s directive to the

‘°° Letter from the Ashgabat Embassy Office of the Commercial Counselor of the Republic of Turkey to the Ministry
of Economy of the Republic of Turkey dated 8 Jan. 2013, Exhibit C-184 (Reply).

Customs Service; and (3) that such conduct amounts to an unlawful expropriation under

Article II of the BIT.?”

The Claimant relies inter alia on the evidence of Mr Uyar and Mr Cilek. Mr Uyar worked
in the Claimant’s logistics department from June 2008 until the end of January 2010, and
his job was to secure materials for the Projects. He states in his witness statement that as of
August 2009 “they” did not allow the Claimant’s employees to enter the construction sites

203 Tt is not clear from Mr Uyar’s statement who

and to access machinery and equipment.
“they” were, but it appears from the context that Mr Uyar is referring to the Contracting
Parties. Mr Cilek, who worked as an assistant to the General Manager of i¢kale from 2003
until September 2009, similarly states in his witness statement that in August 2009, after the
Contracts had been terminated, ickale’s staff was not allowed to enter the construction

sites.2™

Neither Mr Uyar nor Mr Cilek was questioned at the hearing on their evidence relating to

the alleged expropriation of ickale’s machinery and equipment.
The Claimant also relies in support of its claim on documentary evidence, including:

e Documentation listing equipment and machinery imported by the Claimant to

Turkmenistan;?

¢ A notification dated 25 August 2009 from TNGS to ickale terminating the Babarap
Projects Contract and ordering the removal of all personnel from the construction

e Several decisions rendered by the Court of Balkan State in 2010 relating to the
auctioning of i¢kale’s equipment and machinery to satisfy its debt to TNGS arising

out of the Arbitration Court’s decision dated 26 November 2009.7!”

As noted above, the Claimant does not allege that the Contracting Parties breached the
Treaty; it contends that the alleged breaches occurred as a result of intervention by State
organs that were not parties to the Contracts. The Claimant must therefore demonstrate that
at least some if not all of the equipment and machinery was taken by State organs, or that
the takings are otherwise attributable to the State, and that such conduct amounted to an
unlawful expropriation under Article III of the BIT. As summarized above, the evidence
relied upon by the Claimant consists, inter alia, of termination notices sent by the
Contracting Parties to the Claimant; decisions of the Arbitration Court enforcing its earlier
decisions on delay penalties by way of attaching the machinery and equipment of ickale; a
request from the Supreme Court to the State Customs Service that the Claimant be prevented
from removing equipment and materials from Turkmenistan; and decisions of the Court of
Balkan State relating to the auctioning of ickale’s machinery to satisfy its debt to TNGS, for

the purpose of enforcing the Arbitration Court’s earlier decision.

The Tribunal is unable to agree that the termination of the Contracts by the Contracting
Parties or the decisions of the Arbitration Court amount to a direct or indirect expropriation
of the Claimant’s machinery and equipment, within the meaning of Article III of the BIT.
As already determined above in the context of the Claimant’s claim for expropriation of its
contractual rights, there is no evidence before the Tribunal that the termination of the seven
Contracts relating to ongoing projects was based on instructions from the Cabinet of
Ministers. On the contrary, the evidence on record suggests that the Contracts were
terminated by the Contracting Parties at their own initiative. The Claimant does not allege
that the conduct of the Contracting Parties was in any way wrongful under the Treaty, or
that it amounted to expropriation. Nor is the Tribunal able to accept that the decisions of
the Arbitration Court to attach igkale’s machinery and equipment, for the purposes of

enforcing its earlier decisions regarding delay penalties, amount to an unlawful

217 Decisions of the Turkmen courts concerning the auction of igkale’s equipment and machinery, Exhibit C-66
(Memorial).

371.

expropriation. These decisions cannot be assessed independently of the Arbitration Court’s
earlier decisions regarding delay penalties, or the Contracting Parties’ even earlier decisions
to impose delay penalties (which the Claimant does not allege to have amounted to

expropriation) and therefore cannot, on their own, be considered wrongful or expropriatory.

There is some evidence that suggests that the Claimant’s machinery and equipment may
have been taken without justification. This evidence includes the letter from Dayhanbank
to ickale dated 9 January 2010 stating that since ickale had not complied with a decision of
the Arbitration Court, the employer would complete the works “with the available material,
machinery and equipment, [and] inventory stock [on the] construction site.”?!® However,
while State-owned, Dayhanbank is an entity separate from the State and cannot be
considered as a State organ capable of exercising governmental authority, or puissance
publique, and indeed the Claimant does not appear to allege that Dayhanbank’s conduct,
without more, amounted to expropriation. Nor is there sufficient evidence before the
Tribunal that would allow it to determine which machinery and equipment was at issue, or
that would demonstrate that Dayhanbank’s conduct could in any way be considered

attributable to the State.

The directive dated 9 June 2010 from the Supreme Court to the State Customs Service
requesting that the Custom Service identify and locate ickale’s equipment and materials,
take inventory of the equipment, and prevent the Claimant from removing equipment and
materials from Turkmenistan, also suggests that the Claimant’s machinery and equipment
may have been taken without justification.7!” The directive applies, on its face, to all
“equipment and materials” of the Claimant, and there is no evidence before the Tribunal that
the Supreme Court ever lifted the ban. Consequently, the issue arises as to whether the
directive went beyond what would have been necessary for the purpose of recovering the
delay penalties that the Contracting Parties were entitled to pursuant to the Arbitration

Court’s decisions, and thus potentially excessive. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that,

220 Mazars Report, paras.

based on the Claimant’s expert evidence, the total value of the Claimant’s machinery and
equipment amounts to USD 13,990,000 (without VAT), whereas the total of the delay
penalties imposed on the Claimant amounts to approximately USD 2,812,786, plus a further
USD 419,112 imposed on the Claimant in connection with the Abadan School Contract and
the Abadan Kindergarten School Contract, although the Claimant does not appear to
mention this latter amount in the context of its expropriation claim. It therefore appears
that the total value of the Claimant’s assets substantially exceeded the total amount of the
delay penalties imposed on the Claimant, which suggests that the Supreme Court’s directive

may have been expropriatory.

However, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent’s expert, Mr Abdul Sirshar Qureshi of
PricewaterhouseCoopers, raises a number of criticisms of the Claimant’s valuation of its

machinery and equipment, including that:

e The cost method applied by the Claimant’s valuation experts assumes that the value
of the assets at the alleged expropriation date was equal to their original acquisition

price, and that no adjustment had been made for depreciation;

e No third party evidence has been produced for 18 of the 95 assets; the alleged value

of these 18 assets, totaling USD 1.3 million, was nonetheless included in the claim;

e A further 23 assets, which had been acquired for USD 3.131 million, were not
purchased by the Claimant but by third parties, and appear to have been leased or

rented to the Claimant;

e Based on inter-company invoices, some of the assets were sold by the Claimant to
its Turkmen branch at prices that were, in total, approximately USD 1.8 million

higher than the prices reflected on the original supplier invoices;

e The Claimant’s experts appear to have double counted some of the assets, resulting

in an overstatement of the claim by USD 23,000;

 

21-22. The claim appears to be for the amount excluding the VAT; see Second Mazars

 

Report, Appendix D. See also Second Expert Report of Abdul Sirshar Qureshi, pp. 39-40.

128

e The Claimant’s experts have not considered insurance arrangements; and

e There are indications that at least some of the allegedly confiscated assets were

used by the Claimant after the date of their alleged confiscation.

373. The Tribunal agrees, with one exception, with these criticisms of the Claimant’s valuation
of the machinery and equipment. First, the Tribunal agrees that an adjustment for
depreciation is justified and indeed required under Article III(2) of the BIT, which provides
that compensation for expropriation “shall be equivalent to the real value of the expropriated
investment before the expropriatory action was taken or became known.” In this connection,
the Tribunal notes that the Claimant’s expert Mr Gékhan Almaci testified at the Hearing,
when questioned by the Tribunal, that the depreciated value of the assets was approximately
USD 10 million; the Tribunal will revert to this assessment below. Second, the Claimant
has failed to explain or demonstrate on what basis the Tribunal should take into account the
prices of inter-company transfers of some of the machinery and equipment, which were USD
1.8 million higher than the prices at which they were acquired from third parties. Third, the
Claimant has not commented on, and therefore appears to accept, that there has been double
counting of some of the assets in the amount of USD 23,000. Fourth, the evidence on record
also suggests that some of the assets were transferred by the Claimant’s employees to third
parties after their alleged confiscation. Mr Qureshi noted that there was insufficient
evidence available to determine whether the assets which were transferred were identical to
those included in the claim; however, the Tribunal considers that they must have been as the
Claimant argues that all of its machinery and equipment was confiscated. Mr Qureshi
estimated that the value of these assets amounted to approximately USD 1.2 million, and the
Claimant has not offered any alternative valuation. Finally, neither the Claimant nor its
experts have commented on Mr Qureshi’s argument that insurance arrangements should
have been considered as the evidence indicates that the lease agreements concluded by the
Claimant for some of the machinery and equipment required it to insure the leased assets for

their full value.?*! The value of these assets when acquired amounted to approximately USD

221 Exhibits M-035 and SQ-44 to SQ-47.

129

374.

375.

222

2.6 million.?” In the absence any response on this point from the Claimant, the Tribunal
considers that the Claimant must be assumed to have recovered the value of these assets
from insurance. It follows that, even if the evidence suggests that the Claimant was required
under the relevant lease contracts to pay, and argues that it did pay, the value of the leased

223 the evidence

machinery and equipment to the lessors in the event it failed to return them,
indicates that the Claimant would have been able to recover these payments from the

insurance.

The Tribunal does not accept one of the adjustments proposed by the Respondent’s experts
which relates to third party evidence. The Claimant explains that the invoices at issue were
over ten years old, and that it was therefore not required to retain them under Turkish law.

The Tribunal finds this explanation plausible.

If the adjustments accepted by the Tribunal are taken into account, the difference between
the real value of all of the Claimant’s machinery and equipment and the delay penalties is
reduced to USD 1,564,214,24 or USD 1,145,102> if the delay penalties incurred in
connection with the two Abadan projects are taken into account. However, this is not the
end of the matter since, as noted above, the Claimant’s quantification of the depreciated
value of the assets (approximately USD 10 million, as opposed to the acquisition value of
USD 13.990 million) is based merely on the oral evidence of the Claimant’s expert given at
the Hearing and not supported by any calculations that could be commented upon by the
Respondent or reviewed by the Tribunal. Indeed, the evidence before the Tribunal suggests
that the depreciated value of the assets was substantially less than USD 10 million, the

amount mentioned by Mr Almaci.”° The Tribunal therefore cannot accept that this amount

In addition, the claim includes the amount of USD 631,000 (EUR 400,000) relating to a concrete paving machine

that appears to have been rented rather than leased by the Claimant. See Second Expert Report of Abdul Sirshar
Qureshi, p. 41. It does not appear from the evidence that this item was insured.

26 The evidence suggests that some of the assets had been purchased already in 2000, and that the portion of the assets
that were more than four years old at the time of the alleged confiscation amounted to approximately USD 6.3 million.

represents the real value of the Claimant’s machinery and equipment at the time of their
alleged confiscation. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that that the Claimant has failed to

prove that the Supreme Court’s directive was excessive and as such expropriatory.

The Tribunal concludes by majority that the Supreme Court’s directive does not amount to
an expropriation of the Claimant’s machinery and equipment. Accordingly, the Claimant’s

claim stands to be dismissed.

Did the Respondent unlawfully expropriate the Claimant’s ownership rights over the
facilities it was building by operating them without having followed the applicable
handover procedures?

7.31 The Parties’ positions

The Claimant also argues that the Respondent unlawfully expropriated its ownership rights
over its works by starting to operate the facilities built by the Claimant without first

completing the contractual handover procedure.

The Claimant contends that under Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Turkmen “Regulation About
Preparation of Construction Contracting Agreements,” annexed to the Construction Norms
of the Republic of Turkmenistan (SNT 1.06.01-06),”?’ a contractor retains the ownership of
the works until they are accepted by the customer. Therefore, in accordance with the
handover procedure set out in Article 20.2 of the Contracts, the Claimant retained ownership
over the facilities it built until they were accepted by the State Acceptance Committee

through the execution of a Handover Certificate.

The Claimant contends that the Respondent systematically began operating the facilities
built by the Claimant without completing the contractual handover procedure. In doing so,

the Respondent unlawfully expropriated the Claimant’s “immovable properties.”??*

The Respondent takes the position that the Claimant has not alleged any State action in

respect of the alleged failure to comply with the contractual handover procedures, and that

any alleged breach of the procedure is a contractual matter that must be settled with the

Contracting Parties in accordance with the contractual dispute resolution provisions.

In addition, the Respondent argues that the Contracting Parties complied with the handover
procedures, but the handover of the facilities was not certified by the State Acceptance

Committee as “serious defects were discovered.”””°

Finally, the Respondent adds that, in any event, the Claimant has not identified any
“ownership rights” in the works performed under the Contracts which could be expropriated.
According to the Respondent, the Turkmen “Regulation About Preparation of Construction
Contracting Agreements” on which the Claimant relies only states that it is possible that
construction contracts may grant such ownership rights, but does not itself confer any

property rights.

7.3.2 The Tribunal’s analysis

The Tribunal notes that this claim is not mentioned in the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief,
and it is therefore not clear whether it is still being pursued. In any event, the claim is
without merit. First, the Claimant has not made any attempt to demonstrate that the alleged
failure to comply with the handover procedures is attributable to the State rather than the
Contracting Parties, and second, and in any event, according to the Turkmen “Regulation
About Preparation of Construction Contracting Agreements,” the parties to a construction
contract may agree that ownership of the works rests with the contractor. The Claimant does
not allege that there is any provision to that effect in the Contracts, and it appears that there
are no such provisions. Accordingly, the claim does not have any basis in the Contracts and
must be dismissed, even assuming that the facts as alleged by the Claimant were established,

and that the alleged failure was attributable to the State.

THE CLAIMANT’S OTHER CLAIMS

The Claimant’s claim for discrimination

The Claimant contends that the Respondent has failed to comply with the non-impairment
provision in Article 2(2) of the United Kingdom-Turkmenistan BIT, which protects inter
alia against discrimination. The Claimant seeks to import this standard of protection by way
of the MEN clause in Article II(2) of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT. However, as
determined above, such importation is not possible under Article II(2) of the BIT.
Consequently, the Claimant’s claim for non-discrimination, insofar as it is based on Article

2(2) of the United Kingdom-Turkmenistan BIT, has no legal basis.

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant has not pursued a claim under the MEN clause in
Article II(2) of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT which, properly interpreted, does contain a
substantive standard of protection against discrimination. As determined above, this
provision requires each State party to accord to the investments of investors of the other
State party “treatment no less favourable than that accorded in similar situations [...] to

investments of investors of any third country [...].”?*?

The Tribunal notes that in any event, had the Claimant indeed pursued a claim under the
MEN clause, such a claim could not have been successful. The Claimant’s discrimination
claim is essentially based on the argument that Polimeks, another Turkish contractor
involved in construction projects in Turkmenistan, including the Avaza Canal project, was
treated by the Respondent more favorably than the Claimant. According to the Claimant,
“to the best of Claimant’s knowledge Respondent did not exercise any of the unlawful and
illegal acts and omissions it undertook against Claimant towards Polimeks, who was in a
similar situation with Claimant.”?*! In particular, the Claimant alleges that the whole Avaza
Canal project, which was the largest of the Projects, was transferred to Polimeks after the
Claimant’s contract with TNGS had been terminated, and that the Claimant was treated in a

discriminatory manner.

230 See English version of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT, Exhibit C-001 (Reply).

1 Claimant’s Memorial, para. 239.

133

387.

388.

8.2

389.

The problem with this claim would have been, had it in fact been pursued under the Treaty
rather than the imported provision in Article 2(2) of the United Kingdom-Turkmenistan BIT,
that the MFN clause in Article II(2) of the BIT only requires the State parties to accord
“treatment no less favourable than that accorded in similar situations [...] to investments of
investors of any third country [...].” However, as Polimeks is a Turkish investor and not an
investor of a third country, the Claimant’s discrimination claim would have failed on this

prima facie basis.

The Claimant appears to be fully aware of the legal position, as it notes that the non-
discrimination standard it is relying on in support of its claim “is different from [the] MFN
clause [in the BIT]” in that it does not require it to show discrimination in respect of an
investor from a different country.?*> In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant
acknowledges that it has “made a detailed research whether there are foreign construction
companies other than Turkish companies which had brought its investment disputes with
Turkmenistan to international arbitration, [but that] it did not come across with any

publically available information in this respect.”?**

The Claimant’s claims under the Turkmen Foreign Investment Law

8.2.1 The Parties’ positions

The Claimant contends that, in breach of Articles 19(1) and 19(5) of the Turkmen Foreign

Investment Law of 2008, the Respondent “intervened” in the Claimant’s activities “by way

99234 ji

of various unlawful acts and transactions carried out by its regulatory authorities, in

particular by way of

“[...] (i) abolishment of [the] State Fund without appointing any alternative entity
or fund, (ii) postponing the procedural process for the effectiveness of the contracts
(iti) amending the financial and technical terms of the contracts, and (iv)
pressurizing the Contracting [Parties] not to pay the progress payments to [the]
Claimant [...]”?*°

134

390.

392.

393.

The Claimant further appears to argue that the Respondent breached Article 19(5) of the
Foreign Investment Law by requiring, through the State Expert Review, increases in the
volume of the works under the Contracts. The Claimant contends that, in doing so, the State
Expert Review “exceeded its discretion” under Article 7(1) of the Law,”*° which sets out
that an “[i]Jnvestment project with foreign investments shall be subject to mandatory state
expertise, including with regard to observing seismic stability standards, fire- and explosion

safety, environmental and sanitary requirements.”?*”

The Claimant argues that Article 29 of the Foreign Investment Law, which provides inter
alia that, absent a contrary agreement of the parties, disputes in connection with foreign
investment shall be submitted to the Arbitration Court,2** is irrelevant to the present case as
its claims “merely rely on violation of the BIT due to the internationally wrongful acts of

Respondent.”?*?

Finally, in its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant argues that the guarantees provided by the
Respondent in the Foreign Investment Law of 1992, which was in force at the time it made
the investment, “create[d] a legitimate expectation on the side of the investors,” and that the
Respondent had “prejudiced” the Claimant’s legitimate expectations.” This violated the

FET obligation arising from the BIT.

The Respondent notes in this respect that it appears that the Claimant is not asserting any
claims of breach of the Foreign Investment Law. It argues that the Claimant could not in
any event bring any such claims in this arbitration, as Article 29 of the Foreign Investment

Law provides for the submission of disputes to the Arbitration Court.

397.

The Respondent also argues that the Claimant has failed to establish any unlawful conduct
on the part of the Respondent. In addition, it contends that Article 7 of the Foreign
Investment Law does not restrict the State Expert Review to seismic stability standards, fire
and explosion safety, and ecological and sanitary requirements, as is apparent from its
wording. The second paragraph of Article 7 also “makes clear that the Foreign Investment

Law in no way modifies or restricts the normal procedure of [the] State Expert Review.””*!

8.2.2. The Tribunal’s analysis

The Tribunal notes that it is not entirely clear whether the Claimant wishes to rely on the
Respondent’s alleged breach of Turkmenistan’s Foreign Investment Law of 2008 as an
independent cause of action, or whether it is merely making a supporting argument for its
FET claims. Given that the Claimant has requested in its prayer for relief that the Tribunal
specifically determine that the Respondent has “failed to observe its statutory obligations to
guarantee the legal protection of the rights and interests of Claimant prescribed under the

99242

Foreign Investment Law of Turkmenistan, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant

pursues an independent cause of action.

The Tribunal notes that the BIT does not create any cause of action based on an alleged
breach of domestic investment protection laws. Nor does Turkmenistan’s Foreign
Investment Law of 2008 create jurisdiction for a treaty tribunal to resolve such claims; on
the contrary, according to Article 29 of the Foreign Investment Law of 2008, “[a]ny disputes
arisen with regard to foreign investments on the territory of Turkmenistan, shall be settled
amicably or by consideration in Arachy Kazyet of Turkmenistan or upon agreement of the

parties — by Arbitration.”

Article 22(4) of the Foreign Investment Law of 1992 further provides:

“Disputes arising from non-fulfilment or not adequate fulfilment of obligations
related to investment activities between Turkmenistan and foreign states shall be

settled by means of negotiations, or in Law courts determined by inter-state treaties

(agreements).”?**4
After the hearing, the Tribunal raised a question about the relevance, if any, of Article 22(4)
in the context of the present proceedings. The Claimant argued that Turkmenistan, “by
making reference to this inter-state treaty between Turkey and Turkmenistan, also gave
another consent under its Foreign Investment Law for the settlement of [...] investment
disputes through [...] international arbitration.”*45 The Respondent submitted, in turn, that
Article 22(4) is not relevant to this case; the provision “deals only with disputes ‘between
Turkmenistan and foreign states’ and does not encompass investor-State disputes.”*4° The
Respondent notes that the Claimant has not invoked Article 22(4), nor alleged any violations
of the 1992 law; it has only referred to the 2008 law, which contains a differently worded

dispute resolution clause.

The Tribunal is unable to find any basis allowing it to exercise jurisdiction in Article 22(4)
of the Foreign Investment Law of 1992, even assuming the Claimant’s reference to it in its
Post-Hearing Brief could be understood as a claim on the basis of the Law. First, it is unclear
from the wording of Article 22(4) whether it refers to resolution of disputes between States,
or between States and foreign investors. Second, even assuming it did cover the latter type
of disputes, the mere reference to settlement of disputes arising under inter-State treaties “in
Law courts determined” by such treaties cannot be read as an expression of consent by
Turkmenistan to arbitrate claims arising under the Law before such “Law courts.” The

Claimant’s claim is therefore dismissed.

The Claimant’s claims under “general principles of international law”

8.3.1 The Parties’ positions

The Claimant argues that the Respondent breached general principles of international law.
In particular, it contends that by failing to implement the protections under the Foreign

Investment Law, the Respondent breached the principle of the rule of law. It also argues

24 Turkmen Foreign Investment Law of 1992, Exhibit CA-53 (Memorial).

245 Claimant’s PHB, para. 71.

26 Respondent’s PHB, para. 242.

402.

that the breaches of the Foreign Investment Law by organs of the Respondent were
intentional, and therefore amounted to a breach of the principle of good faith, which is a
general principle of law. Finally, the Claimant contends that “since the application of delay
penalties and terminations were realized as a result of unfair pressure of Respondent, such
interference also constitutes a violation of Nemo auditor propriam turpitudinem

allegans.”?47

The Respondent takes the position that the Claimant has failed to advance any coherent
explanation of its claims under general principles of international law. In particular,
according to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to provide any legal standard that
would form the basis for a claim. In addition, according to the Respondent, the complaints
which the Claimant attempts to advance as claims under general principles of international

law have already been shown to be devoid of any merit in the context of its other claims.

8.3.2 The Tribunal’s analysis

The Claimant has not attempted to articulate any basis in the BIT for its claims of breaches
of general principles of international law, and indeed it is not clear whether the Claimant’s
arguments are independent or free-standing claims, or whether they are merely intended to
support its other claims. Given that the Claimant requests in its prayer for relief that the
Tribunal determine that the Respondent has “violated the General Principles of International

Law,248

the Tribunal must conclude that the Claimant’s claims are indeed independent
claims and not merely supporting arguments. However, there is no basis for the claims in
the BIT, which does not create any cause of action under general principles of international

law. The claims must therefore be dismissed.

COSTS
The Parties’ positions

The Parties agreed at the Hearing that they would each submit a statement of costs, instead
of a full-fledged cost submission with supporting argument. As noted above in Section 2,
the Respondent objected to the Claimant’s cost submission on the basis that it contained
legal argument, contrary to the Parties’ agreement at the Hearing, as confirmed by the
Tribunal. The Tribunal subsequently decided that both the Claimant’s cost submission and

the Respondent’s objection would be disregarded insofar as they contained legal argument.

According to the Claimant’s Statement of Costs, its legal fees amounted to USD 291,636
and EUR 676,650. In accordance with the engagement letter between the Claimant and its
legal counsel, the Claimant also sought compensation for an additional fee of EUR 250,000
and a success fee equal to 5% of the amount recovered. The fees of the Claimant’s experts
amount to EUR 677,467, and the costs of legal counsel, experts and witnesses to USD
118,731 and EUR 72,657. The Claimant also claims compensation, in the amount of USD
95,161, in relation to costs it incurred in defending bank guarantee claims before the Turkish
courts, and EUR 185,303 in relation to costs it incurred in the Austrian courts for the same
reason. The Claimant also claims for various disbursements in the amount of USD 77,056

and EUR 1,575. The Claimant’s total costs amount to USD 1,066,148 and EUR 1,615,652.

The Respondent’s fees and expenses, for which it seeks recovery, are summarized in the

The Tribunal’s analysis

The relevant rules covering the award of costs of the proceedings can be found in Chapter
VI of the ICSID Convention, and in particular in Article 61(2) of the Convention, which

provides:

“In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the
parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those
expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the
charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision
shall form part of the award.”

 

The Tribunal notes that Article 61(2) of the Convention does not prescribe any particular
approach to the allocation of costs and provides the Tribunal with a considerable degree of

discretion in making costs awards.

Exercising its discretion, and noting that both Parties seek recovery of their fees and costs
and thus agree with the “costs follow the event” principle, the Tribunal considers it
appropriate to follow this principle and award costs to the prevailing party.” However, in
view of the substantially disparate amounts spent by the Parties in the course of the
proceedings, and keeping mind that the Hearing originally scheduled for October 2013 was
postponed at the Respondent’s request only a few weeks before the hearing (see paragraphs
40-48, supra), which resulted in a substantial delay in the proceedings and the associated
additional costs, the Tribunal finds it appropriate, by a majority, that the Claimant be ordered
to reimburse not more than 20% of the Respondent’s costs of arbitration, i.e., USD

1,747,521.2%°

the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the ICSID facilities, the exact amount

of which shall be subsequently notified in writing to the Parties by the Centre.?*!

411. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides as follows:
a. The Claimant’s claims fall within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and are admissible;

b. The Claimant has made an “investment” within the meaning of Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention and Article I(2) of the Turkey-Turkmenistan Bilateral

Investment Treaty;

c. The Respondent’s objection to the Claimant’s claims on the basis that they are

contract claims rather than treaty claims is considered together with the merits;
d. The Claimant’s claims are dismissed in their entirety for lack of merit;

e. The Claimant shall pay the Respondent the amount of USD 1,747,521 as

reimbursement of the Respondent’s legal and expert fees and expenses;

f. The Parties shall bear and equally share the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and

the costs of the ICSID facilities; and

g. All other claims and requests for relief by either Party are dismissed.

Partially Dissenting Opinion
in
Ickale insaat Limited Sirketi v. Turkmenistan

(ICSID Case No. ARB/10/24)

I am in agreement with the Tribunal’s Award except as noted below:

ae Section 4: The Interpretation of Article VII(2) of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT

1G I address here specifically the Tribunal’s analysis beginning at paragraph 210 of the
Award.

2. I disagree in part with the assumptions of the majority in paragraph 210. I found credible
and persuasive the testimony of Ms. Ozbilgic, then a member of the staff of the Turkish
Government agency (Directorate of Incentive Implementation and Foreign Investment,
Turkish Ministry of the Economy) with responsibility for investment treaties. Ms.
Ozbilgic worked on the draft of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT. Her testimony may be
considered under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention as part of the preparatory work of
the treaty and circumstances of its conclusion. Ms. Ozbilgig’s testimony, together with
the official explanatory note prepared by the Government of Turkey during its ratification
of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT! and the subsequent letter of the Secretariat of the
Treasury,” were all consistent and persuasive. While allowing for the majority’s view
that this documentary evidence is only information that is “relevant,” I regard it as
confirmatory of Ms. Ozbilgig’s testimony, which even the majority found to be “helpful
in understanding the way in which Turkey prepared for investment treaty negotiations.”

The testimony and documents, taken together with the clear language of the chapeau of

' Exh, C-93 (Reply).
? Exh. C-96 (Reply).
3 Award, para. 210 & n. 47.

Article VII(2), evidence the contracting States’ intent to provide an option to foreign
investors to choose whether to go to international arbitration or to host State courts.
Neither party provided evidence of any interest to the contrary. Indeed, Turkmenistan
offered no evidence of anything related to the negotiating history or any circumstances of
the conclusion of the Treaty, and the Turkish investor provided direct evidence that
Turkey intended to provide the investor an option to choose the forum in the event of a

dispute and that this was a significant interest of Turkey at the time.

3. Further, the plain language of the chapeau of Article VII(2) (“the dispute can be
submitted as the investor may choose”) providing that it is the investor’s option is
deprived of meaning if one attributes a mandatory reading to the “provided that, if”
language in a subsidiary clause. The testimony of Ms. Ozbilgig and documentary
evidence assist in the interpretation of the “provided that, if’ clause in Article VII(2) of
the BIT. Indeed, my view in this regard is confirmed by the failure of Turkmenistan to
provide any contemporaneous evidence to support its current interpretation of Article
VII(2) of the BIT, including of its own treaty practice, or any contemporaneous evidence
of any circumstance demonstrating its interest in imposing a mandatory requirement to go
first to the Turkmen courts. It is most revealing that Turkmenistan did not require this in

any other treaty that it entered into before or after concluding this treaty.*

4. Investment treaty tribunals commonly consider the parties’ contemporaneous practice in
concluding investment treaties as a reflection of the parties’ general policies relating to
such treaties, and thus as part of the circumstances of the conclusion of a treaty, in order
to confirm the interpretation of its provisions. See, e.g., KT Asia Investment Group B.V.
v. Republic of Kazakhstan, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8, Award (17 Oct. 2013), para. 123
(“the Tribunal’s reading of the treaty language is further strengthened if one bears in
mind that in twenty-four Kazakh BITs the Respondent has agreed to the same test as in
the present one ... while in ten other BITs it has added a requirement ....”); Plama
Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria, \CSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on
Jurisdiction (8 Feb. 2005), para. 195 (“treaties between one of the Contracting Parties and

third States may be taken into account for the purpose of clarifying the meaning of a

4 See Exh. C-103 (Reply) (chart of BITs concluded by Turkmenistan).

treaty’s text at the time it was entered into”); id., para. 196 (taking into account, as a
circumstance of the conclusion of the Bulgaria-~Cyprus BIT, that, ‘[a]t that time, Bulgaria
was under a communist regime that favored bilateral investment treaties with limited
protections for foreign investors and with very limited dispute resolution provisions”);
Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic, CSID Case No. ARB/04/14,
Award (8 Dec. 2008), n. 147 (referring to BITs entered by Argentina with third States as
relevant to confirm whether Argentina had a “policy” with respect to the provision at
issue, and emphasizing the importance of “contemporaneity” in the interpretation of a
treaty: “it must be construed as at the time it was entered into.”); see also National Grid
ple v. Argentine Republic, UNCITRAL, Decision on Jurisdiction (20 June 2006), paras.
84-85 (considering the treaty practice of the parties to the UK-Argentina BIT in
interpreting that BIT’s MFN clause); Aguas del Tunari, S.A. v. Republic of Bolivia,
ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Jurisdiction (21 Oct. 2005), para. 293 (“Most
relevant to an assessment of state practice possibly bearing on the 1992 Bolivia-
Netherlands BIT are those BITs which were negotiated contemporaneously in the early
1990s.”); id., paras. 294-314 (analyzing the Dutch and Bolivian investment treaty
practice). Hence the relevance of the other Turkmen treaty practice, all of which permits
the choice of the forum for international arbitration without any mandatory reference to

Turkmen courts, and complete paucity of any evidence to the contrary is compelling.

With respect to paragraph 217-218 of the Award, I agree with the majority to the extent
that, in view of the evidence before the Tribunal, neither Turkey nor Turkmenistan
appears to have had a clear policy requiring the resolution of investor-State disputes
before local courts. As noted above, no such requirement is found in any of
Turkmenistan’s BITs, and neither Party presented evidence that could be taken into
account in the interpretation of the “provided that, if” clause in the Turkey-Turkmenistan
BIT as a supplementary means of interpretation. I diverge, however, and find that the
absence in any other Turkmen treaty and/or any provision in Turkmenistan’s foreign
investment law requiring mandatory reference of international disputes to the Turkmen
courts should be taken into account in assessing whether the treaty language of Article

VII(2) provides an optional approach.

6. With respect to paragraphs 220-226 of the Award, I do not accept Professor Gasparov’s
evidence as dispositive on the proper translation of the Russian expression “pri uslovii,
esli”. Professor Gasparov’s testimony referred to translation of a term by a native
Russian speaker who was writing in Russian. Respondent chose not to call the
Claimant’s opposing Russian language expert whose declaration affirmed that the phrase
could have been translated from the awkward English version of the treaty submitted by
the native Turkish speakers.’ I regard the evidence provided by Ms. Ozbilgig that the
Russian version was likely translated from the English version supplied by the
Government of Turkey significant.® In the absence of any evidence whatsoever presented
by Turkmenistan that the Russian version of the BIT was translated by a native Russian
speaker, rather than someone to whom Russian may have been a third or fourth language
in the Turkish Embassy or Turkmen Embassy in Moscow or in Ashgabat translating the
English drafted by a native Turkish speaker, indeed the evidence supports the view that
the Russian version was translated by a non-native Russian speaker. Hence, I did not
find persuasive Professor Gasparov’s evidence on the proper translation in classical
Russian as to the meaning of that term in the treaty. I found more persuasive of the
actual circumstances at the time of the execution of the BIT the testimony of Ms.
Ozbilgig and Mr. Kozyrev that the clause “pri uslovii, esli” likely was translated by a
non-native Russian speaker from the English version of the treaty (drafted by a native

Turkish speaker) and was meant to convey the same optional meaning “provided that if”.

7. With respect to paragraph 228 of the Award, again, I disagree with the majority. A
fundamental rule of treaty interpretation is that meaning must be afforded to provide
meaning to the entire clause: ut res magis valeat quam pereat, i.e., each word of a clause

must be given meaning, and a proper interpretation cannot leave words meaningless,” a

* See Declaration of Mr. Kozyrev dated 9 Aug. 2013, para. 6 (concluding that the flawed grammar and ambiguity of
the Russian text most likely resulted from a literal and inaccurate translation from the English text).

® See Witness Statement of Ms. Ozbilgig dated 17 Aug. 2013, para. 5 (“The English authentic version of the BIT
which was signed between Turkey and Turkmenistan (‘the Contracting Parties’) is the text prepared by Turkey. The
Authentic Russian version of the BIT was translated from the authentic English version only after the Contracting
Parties had agreed upon the terms of the English version.”); Hearing Transcript, Day 3, pp. 96:22-100:25 (Cross-
Examination of Ms. Ozbilgig).

” See Eureko B.V. v. Republic of Poland, Partial Award dated 19 Aug. 2005, para. 248 (“It is a cardinal rule of the
interpretation of treaties that each and every operative clause of a treaty is to be interpreted as meaningful rather than

principle the Tribunal recognizes elsewhere in the Award.* Under Article VII(2) of the
BIT, the chapeau clearly provides the option to the investor to select a method of dispute
resolution (“the dispute can be submitted as the investor may choose”). To give meaning
to the investor’s option to select among the international arbitral fora ICSID, UNCITRAL
or ICC, the selection of the local courts must provide an additional option (i.e., the
investor has the choice of the three types of international arbitration mentioned or to
select host state courts). If the investor selects the local courts then there is a one year
hiatus for the local courts to decide and only after that time may the investor invoke the
international arbitral option (as described below there could be a different option
depending on the relevance of the formatting). The investor’s option provided in the
chapeau cannot be deprived of any meaning by interpreting a subsidiary clause as
effectively depriving the investor of any choice. I accordingly disagree with paragraph
225 of the Award.

8. With respect to paragraphs 227 and 228 of the Award, I disagree, as the Tribunal cannot
conclude that the Russian version is “clear and unambiguous” choosing it as the more
reliable version and at the same time minimize as a matter of treaty interpretation the
difference in formatting in the Russian version of the BIT (compare the quotes of the text
in paragraphs 176 and 189 of the Award), which is formatted in such a way that the
clause “pri uslovii, esli” forms part of the ICC option. It is undeniable that Article VII(2)
provides “the dispute can be submitted as the investor may choose” from one of three
options for international arbitration: (a) ICSID, (b) UNCITRAL, or (c) ICC. If the
formatting from the Russian version is given meaning then that reference to Turkmen
courts modifies only the ICC option, the alleged ambiguity or obscurity that concerns the
majority is removed as it provides the investor the choice that the chapeau envisions and

does not mandate the investor proceed first to host State courts unless the investor prefers

 

meaningless. [T]reaties, and hence their clauses, are to be interpreted so as to render them effective rather than
ineffective.”); Ambiente Ufficio S.p.A. and Others v. Argentine Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/08/9, Decision on
Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated 8 Feb. 2013, para. 593 (“Treaty provisions should not be construed in a way
that takes away from them all useful effect (ut res magis valeat quam pereat).”); OPPENHEIM'S INTERNATIONAL LAW
1280-81 (R. Jennings & A. Watts eds., 9th ed. 1996) (“The parties are assumed to intend provisions of a treaty to
have a certain effect, and not to be meaningless: the maxim is ut res magis valeat quam pereat. Therefore, an
interpretation is not admissible which would make a provision meaningless, or ineffective.”).

* Award, para. 329.

the ICC option. The formatting therefore is significant in the Russian version in that it in
fact confirms the optional reading of the clause as a whole. Under Article 31 of the
Vienna Convention, the “provided that, if’ clause in my view should be interpreted in
good faith such that the plain language in the chapeau of Article VII(2) as to the

investor’s option must have a meaning.

9. Accordingly, the formatting would include the “pri us/ovii, esli” clause as part of and
only applicable to the ICC option, but not to the ICSID or UNCITRAL options. This
approach provides full meaning to all parts of Article VII(2), requiring the investor to
proceed first to Turkmen courts only if the investor rejects ICSID and UNCITRAL

arbitration.

10. I similarly disagree with paragraph 228 of the Award, where the majority of the Tribunal
notes that the meaning of the “provided that, if’ clause in the English and Russian texts
of the Treaty diverges: according to the majority, the meaning of the English version
remains obscure, and the Russian version is clear and unambiguous. On the basis of the
evidence before the Tribunal as to the circumstances surrounding the preparation and
execution of the BIT, other treaty practice of both State parties and the language experts
presented by both sides, I disagree. To the contrary, the English and Russian versions of
Article VII (2) when read together in their entirety (beginning with the chapeau language
of the clause) provide an optional choice between international arbitration and the local
courts in the context of this dispute: an investor who chose ICSID without first going to
Turkmen courts. According to the English text (with its formatting), the investor may
select among three international arbitral fora or local courts: but if the investor selects the
local courts option, and the local courts do not render a decision within one year, then the
investor may still choose international arbitration. According to the Russian text with its
formatting, the investor may choose among two international arbitral fora; if the investor

chooses local courts, it may subsequently choose only ICC arbitration.’ I agree with the

° See Declaration of Mr. Kozyrev dated 9 Aug. 2013, para. 6 (“Even if the Russian text is not grammatically correct,
should the provision including the phrase pri uslovii, esli be considered mandatory, it will bring an obligation to the
investor to recourse to the local courts of the host State only if it chooses to apply to the Court of Arbitration of the
Paris International Chamber of Commerce.”); Award, para. 225. In this regard, I disagree with the majority’s view
as reflected in paragraph 226 of the Award.

majority’s observation in paragraph 229 of the Award that the Tribunal is limited to
resolving the dispute submitted to it on the basis of the evidence before it. The optional
reading of the clause is a consistent one with respect to the dispute presented here: the
investor chose ICSID arbitration—not the local courts—as its first choice which is
permitted under the plain language of either version. While the formatting is different in
the English and the Russian language versions, this is irrelevant to the present dispute
because the investor selected ICSID arbitration and in both the English and Russian
versions read optionally this selection is permissible without resort to the local courts.
The Tribunal need not go further to resolve potential ambiguity or obscurity issues that
may arise if an investor in another dispute wishes to choose the local courts and/or ICC

arbitration.

11° Further, I disagree with the majority’s conclusion in paragraph 230 of the Award. I agree
that the State parties may make a choice to impose a mandatory domestic court litigation
precondition to international arbitration, but I regard the State parties to the Turkey-
Turkmenistan BIT as having made the choice in this instance to provide the investor with
the option to go to international arbitration or to local courts. I agree with the
interpretation of the Sehil tribunal (including the portion of its decision quoted in

paragraph 229 of the Award).

12. 1 disagree with paragraph 241 of the Award to the extent that reference is made to the
selection of local courts as “in principle mandatory”; as stated above, it is optional. I
agree with the remainder of paragraph 241. I also disagree with paragraph 260 to the
extent that the majority finds it is unable to accept Claimant’s allegations and evidence as
proof that any resort to the Turkmen courts would have been futile. To the contrary, in
my view, Claimant demonstrated it suffered a denial of justice by the Turkmen courts in
the proceedings before the Turkmen courts initiated by Turkmenistan.'° Thus it would
have been futile to impose a requirement for further recourse to Turkmen courts. 1,
however, agree with the majority that the BIT simply does not include a provision that

permits Claimant to recover for a lack of fair and equitable treatment or a denial of
justice, but that does not preclude consideration of such a denial of justice for purposes of

considering the futility of requiring a claimant to proceed to local courts.

13. Further, I disagree with paragraph 260 to the extent the majority’s analysis stops with the
lack of a futility exception in the express language of Article VII. I do not regard the lack
of express language in Article VII(2) of the BIT permitting a finding of futility as
dispositive. Under established customary international law, which under Article 31 of the
Vienna Convention is to be “taken into account, together with the context” in interpreting
the BIT to the extent it provides “relevant rules of international law applicable in the
relations between the parties,” Claimant is not required to pursue recourse to local courts

that is demonstrably futile.''

14. In the context of the facts, treaty language, treaty practice and evidence in this particular
case, I agree with the remainder of the Award regarding the interpretation of Article
VII(2).

2. Section 7: The Claimant’s Expropriation Claims

15. I dissent with respect to paragraphs 371-376 of the Award. Specifically, with respect to
paragraph 371 of the Award, I regard the Supreme Court’s directive dated 9 June 2010 to
the State Customs Service as going beyond what was necessary to recover the delay
penalties to which the contracting parties were entitled pursuant to the Arbitration Court’s

decisions. Based upon the evidence in the record and for the reasons set forth below, I

"' Ambiente Ufficio S.p.A. and Others v. Argentine Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/08/9, Decision on Jurisdiction
and Admissibility dated 8 Feb. 2013, para. 599 (“It appears to be generally accepted in international law that
obligations requiring an individual to approach a State’s local courts before a claim may be taken to the international
plane do not apply unconditionally. . .. This exception to the local to the local remedies rule, the so-called futility
rule, is now universally recognized in the law of diplomatic protection. It is set out in Art. 15(a) of the Draft
Articles of the International Law Commission on Diplomatic Protection of 2006 . . . in the following manner: ‘Local
remedies do not need to be exhausted where [. . .] [t]here are no reasonably available local remedies to provide
effective redress, or the local remedies provide no reasonable possibility of such redress.”); see id., para. 600 (“Art.
8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT does not mention or refer to such [futility] exception. This is not the end of the
matter, however. According to the general rules of treaty interpretation as codified in Art. 31 of the VCLT, it is
required that when interpreting a treaty provision ‘any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations
between the parties’ shall be ‘taken into account, together with the context’ (Art. 31 para. 3 lit. c of the VCLT). The
term ‘relevant rules of international law’ also includes pertinent customary international law.”) (internal references
omitted).

disagree with the majority and conclude that the Supreme Court’s directive was in fact
excessive and thus expropriatory, because it resulted in the seizure of all of Claimant’s
machinery and equipment in Turkmenistan, significantly in excess of any penalties. The
combined value of this machinery and equipment, which was deployed by Claimant to
perform its investment, far exceeded any reasonable delay penalty that could have been

imposed by the Supreme Court.

As a preliminary matter, Claimant contends that the Arbitration Court greatly inflated the
amount of delay penalties, which resulted in unjust and premature fines upon Claimant.'?
The evidence in the record supports a discrepancy as to the amount of any legitimate
penalties. Specifically, Claimant explained that the Arbitration Court failed to consider
the “actual events causing a delay” and “did not evaluate a possible responsibility of the
Respondent for the delay.”'? In its Decision dated 18 March 2010 regarding the Avaza
Canal Contract (TNGIZ-I 13), the Arbitration Court ruled that some of Claimant’s
property was to be attached and sold in order to collect a delay penalty of EUR 228,520
and governmental tax of 1,625,582 Manat (USD 587,380).'? In reaching this decision,
the Arbitration Court, however, did not take into account that Respondent had contributed
to the delay in construction by failing to make progress payments on time or, in some
instances, failing to make them at all and, furthermore, that the Contract was terminated
by Respondent’s Contracting Authority on 27 August 2009, prior to the scheduled
completion date of 10 October 2009.!5

Despite the significant evidence in the record questioning the amount of the delay

penalties,'° the majority accepted the amount of the delay penalties as alleged by

Respondent (USD 2,812,786).'’ I disagree with the majority’s approach. A review of the
record shows that Claimant provided sufficient evidence detailing the amount of the
inflation of the penalties (USD 1,650,825), and that should be taken into account to
reduce them to USD 1,161,961.'*

18. According to Claimant’s expert Mr. Almaci of Mazars, the total value of the machinery
and equipment that Respondent is alleged to have expropriated amounted to USD
13,990,000 (without VAT).'? Claimant submitted evidence, in the form of a list, showing
the valuation of the equipment and machinery imported by it, which Respondent
subsequently confiscated.”’ In this context, the Tribunal notes in paragraph 373 of the
Award that Respondent’s expert Mr. Qureshi had offered certain criticisms of Mr.
Almaci’s valuation, including that the latter had failed to account for the depreciation of
the equipment and machinery.”! The Tribunal further observes in paragraph 373 of its
Award that Mr. Almaci testified at the Hearing that the depreciated value of the assets
amounted to approximately USD 10 million. I disagree further with the majority’s
rejection of the testimony of Claimant’s expert and the majority’s reference to the
number in the Second Expert Report of Mr. Qureshi reducing the value of the machinery
by USD 6.3 million to USD 7,690,000.

19. In further considering this issue, the Tribunal considered whether any offsets should be
applied to the USD 10 million in determining whether Claimant was entitled to any
damages. I agree with the majority’s application of three offsets, as delineated in
paragraph 372 of the Award, relating to: Claimant’s inter-company transfers totaling

USD 1.8 million; double-counting of some of the assets amounting to USD 23,000; and

transfer of some assets, valued at approximately USD 1.2 million, to third parties, after

their alleged confiscation.

I disagree however, with the majority’s application of the fourth offset, relating to
Claimant’s assumed insurance arrangements. In paragraph 373 of the Award, the
majority notes that Claimant has not commented on Respondent’s (unsubstantiated)
assertion that Claimant’s insurance arrangements for the leased assets should be taken
into account when determining the actual valuation of the machinery. The majority
assumes that Claimant would have been able to recover any payments it made to the
lessors for the leased assets from its insurance arrangements and Claimant’s silence is
essentially acquiescence in this. I note however, that Claimant’s evidence establishes that
it was obligated to pay the value of the leased machinery and equipment to its lessors.”?
Furthermore, as the Award recognizes in footnotes 220, 221 and 222, only some of the
equipment was leased, with the rest being rented or owned by Claimant, and only some
of the lease agreements required insurance coverage. There is no evidence in the record
showing that Claimant was reimbursed through an insurance policy for any of the

evidential burden to support its assertion that insurance recovery should be taken into
account.*4 For these reasons, | disagree with the majority, and cannot conclude by
inference or otherwise, that Claimant was reimbursed by insurance for machinery and

equipment leased from third parties.

Claimant’s evidence was sufficient with respect to the depreciation and insurance issues,

insurance issues.

I also do not agree with paragraph 375 of the Award. Contrary to an international
tribunal’s remit to conduct an “overall assessment of the accumulated evidence,””° the
majority assessed the evidence without balanced consideration of both sides.
Fundamentally, as described above, I do not agree with the amount of the delay penalties,
as the majority did accepting Respondent’s allegations, as USD 2.8 million. This ignored
all of Claimant’s evidence. In my opinion, for the reasons reflected in paragraphs 16-17

above, the legitimate penalties are at most USD 1,161,961.

The real value of all of the Claimants machinery and equipment (i.e., USD 10 million),
accounting for the various deductions noted in paragraph 373 of the Award, amounts to
USD 6,977,000" or, if using USD 13,990,000, to USD 10,973,000.* The gap between
the amount of the penalties (USD 1,161,961; see para. 17 above) and the value of the
equipment seized is significant—at least USD 5,815,039” or at most USD 9,805,039.°°
Even use of the alternative number from Mr. Qureshi’s Second Report results in a
valuation results in a gap of USD 3,505,039! The majority however does not accept the
various expert reports and import documentation as sufficient and concludes it could not
determine the real value of the Claimant’s machinery. This imposes too high a standard
of proof in my view. The Claimant’s evidence when viewed in its totality and weighed

against Respondent’s rebuttal in my view was sufficient. I therefore conclude that

Claimant has demonstrated that the Supreme Court’s directive was excessive and thus

expropriatory. This is not a relatively limited discrepancy.

Most fundamentally, given that the Supreme Court’s directive to the Customs Service
was in fact excessive, the resulting expropriation of the machinery and equipment
occurred without due process, was discriminatory and not in the public interest. Thus,
the directive of the Supreme Court and the actions of the Customs Service prohibiting
Claimant to export its machinery and equipment did in fact violate Article III of the BIT.
Furthermore, in the context of USD 10 million (the claim for the machinery and
equipment), the amount of the discrepancy is USD 5.8 or USD 9.8 million (or at a
minimum USD 3.5 million), which is either 58% or 98% of the entire imported value.

Both sums are substantial within the circumstances of this dispute.”

Treaty is sufficient to support the imposition of State responsibility for the breach of
Article III and thus damages according to Article III(2). This clearly is not a violation
without consequence. Damages in the amount of the excess should be imposed in the

amount of USD 5,815,039.00.

Section 9: Costs

In Section 9.2 of the Award, I disagree specifically with the majority’s analysis in
paragraph 409. In my view, in exercising it discretion under Article 61(2) of the
Convention, the Tribunal is required to weigh the reasonableness of a claim for costs,
taking into account a number of factors including the importance of the matter to the

Parties, the amount in dispute, the amount and extent of factual and expert evidence

required efforts across multiple jurisdictions, extensive arrangements for travel and/or
translation work. In considering these various factors in context in this case, the amount
in dispute is USD 537,356,530.33 plus EUR 26,678,407.26 plus interest,” and the matter
is of significant importance to the Claimant. Claimant allegedly has been deprived of
significant value of its investment and performance on thirteen construction contracts in

Respondent’s territory.

Further, Claimant was deprived of its machinery and equipment in the amount of USD
5.8 million (at a minimum) due to the excessive seizure of the machinery and equipment
by the Supreme Court’s directive due to limited delay penalties. At a minimum, this
amount should be offset against the Respondent’s costs. The Tribunal in its discretion is

balancing here the interests of both sides and this cannot be ignored.

Moreover, Respondent insisted on and raised preliminary objections seeking bifurcation

Respondent’s request protracted the proceeding, and it was denied*° Moreover, the

rather of several events with different outcomes.*® Further, Respondent delayed the
hearing on the merits while it organized its finances as noted in paragraphs 40-44 of the

(ICSID Case No. ARB/10/24)

PARTIALLY DISSENTING OPINION

PROFESSOR PHILIPPE SANDS QC

Tam in general agreement with the final outcome of these proceedings, as reflected in an
Award and reasoning that rejects the entirety of the claims put forward by the Claimant
in these proceedings. I am comfortable with much of the Tribunal’s approach as regards
the interpretation and application of the Turkey-Turkmenistan Bilateral Investment
Treaty, in particular the conclusion that its Article VII(2) is properly to be interpreted as
requiring prior recourse to the domestic courts of the relevant party before international

arbitration proceedings are brought (Award, para. 228).

2. Regrettably, I disagree with the approach adopted by the majority on two matters that
relate to the interpretation and application of the Article VII(2) treaty requirement: first,
the majority’s conclusion that Article VII(2) is to be interpreted and applied as a
provision that goes to the admissibility of the claim brought, as opposed to the existence
of the jurisdiction of the forum that has been seized; and second, the majority’s finding
that on the facts of this case the requirements of Article VII(2) were not a bar to the
admissibility of the claims, despite the fact the Claimant had no prior recourse to the

national courts.
Jurisdiction/Admissibility

3. | With regard to the question of whether the obligation set forth in Article VII(2) to have
prior recourse to national courts is a jurisdictional requirement or goes to the
admissibility of a claim, I disagree with the reasons and conclusions as set out in
paragraphs 240-247 of the Award. In my view, that requirement of Article VII(2) is an

obligation that goes to the existence of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

4. This is the same issue that was before another ICSID arbitral tribunal on which I sat, in
the case of Kilig.! That Tribunal decided, by a majority, that Article VII(2) imposed a
mandatory requirement of recourse to the national courts as a jurisdictional prerequisite
to having access to an ICSID Tribunal. In accepting appointment to this Tribunal,
following a challenge made by the Claimant, I made clear that I would treat this issue
with an open mind, and this I have done. The arguments of the parties in this case were
different from those put forward in the earlier case: in this case, both parties agreed with
the finding of the majority in the Kili¢ case, a point noted by the majority (see paras. 238-
9 of the Award: “Both Parties have ... taken the position that compliance with Article

VII(2) of the BIT is an issue of jurisdiction rather than admissibility”).

5. The only argument to the contrary has been put forward by the majority. I agree that an
arbitral tribunal is not bound by the shared views of the parties, on a matter that goes to

the question of whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide a case. However, I am not

! ICSID Case No. ARB/10/1, Kilig Ingaat Ithalat ihracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi v Turkmenistan,
Award (2 July 2013).

persuaded by the arguments put forward by the majority in departing from the commonly

held views of the parties.

6. The majority view is somewhat minimalist in its approach. First, it asserts that the
relevant provision of Article VII(2) is not a jurisdictional requirement because it merely
“sets out the procedure, or the step to be taken, in the event the dispute cannot be settled”,
and is accordingly to be treated as addressing an “issue of how ... consent is to be invoked

by a foreign investor ... rather than ‘whether’” (Award, para. 242). No authority is
provided for the proposition that a procedure that the drafters of a BIT have required a
potential claimant to take is not such as to create an obligation that goes to the existence
of a jurisdiction. Moreover, none of the authorities that adopt a different view to the
majority in this case on this point — see e.g. the leading authority of Wintershall

Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic? - is addressed or distinguished.

7. Second, the majority takes issue with the approach of the majority in Ki/i¢ on the basis
that the finding was premised on “a contractual analogy which ... is both conceptually
inaccurate and legally incorrect”: the “BIT is not a contract”, the majority in this case
concludes (Award, para. 244). Yet the majority in Kilig did not assert that a BIT was a
contract, or was to be treated as a contract: the agreement to which reference is made in
that decision is to the existence of an offer by the State (as reflected in the BIT) and the
acceptance by the investor (of the offer made in the BIT) (Kilig, paras. 6.2.1-2). The
contractual analogy to which the majority in Kili¢ referred did not go to the manner of

interpreting Article VII(2), as asserted.

8. Rather, the heart of the Kilig decision is the reference to Article 26 of the ICSID
Convention (at paras. 6.2.4 et seq.), and its use in interpreting the condition that Turkey

and Turkmenistan incorporated into their BIT. Article 26 provides that

2 ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award (8 December 2008) (Nariman, Torres Bernardez, Bernardini); see also
Pierre-Marie Dupuy, ‘Preconditions to Arbitration and Consent of States to ICSID Jurisdiction’, in Meg Kinnear
et al. (Eds), Building International Investment Law: The First 50 Years of ICSID (2015), at 219-236.

Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise
stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A
Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial
remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention.” (emphasis

added)

This language appears to make clear that in providing its consent for ICSID jurisdiction,
a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention (such as Turkmenistan or Turkey) is free to
attach as a condition the requirement that a claimant shall have prior recourse to a local
judicial remedy. As set out in Article 26 — which is to be found in Chapter II of the ICSID
Convention, entitled “Jurisdiction of the Centre” — the Kilig tribunal found that a
condition of this kind forms part of the very existence of the jurisdiction of the forum
that is seized, not the exercise of a jurisdiction that has been found to exist. Chapter IT of
the ICSID Convention is concerned with matters of jurisdiction, not admissibility:
indeed, the word “admissibility” is not to be found in that Chapter, or indeed in the
Convention. Yet the majority in this case is curiously silent about Chapter II of the ICSID
Convention and its Article 26, and offers no explanation as to how it justifies an

alternative interpretation or reading of Article 26 and the surrounding provisions.

Third, the majority states that it sees no need to distinguish the facts of the present case
from others, or the legal authorities cited by the Ki/i¢ Tribunal, or the legal authorities
invoked by the Parties (Award, para. 245). Indeed, it is unfortunate that the majority cites
not a single authority in support of its conclusion, instead making the point by assertion
that the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility is a fine one and that
“reasonable arbitrators may reasonably disagree”. Reasonable arbitrators may indeed
reasonably disagree, but the nature of the disagreement is more easily comprehended —
and the possibility of its resolution more likely — if it is accompanied by reasoning that

cites to existing authorities.

Fourth, and relatedly, the one authority on which the majority places considerable
reliance is an article by Jan Paulsson, entitled ‘Jurisdiction and Admissibility’, published
in 2005 and cited by the majority in Kili¢ in support of its conclusion (Award, para. 245).
The majority melds together three selected passages from pages 616 and 617 of Mr

Paulsson’s article, but the act of melding seems to have misconstrued what the author

intended. The majority omits the significant words of the text that incorporates footnote

47, a footnote in which Mr Paulsson expresses his view that

“Tf an ephemeral arbitral tribunal is established under a treaty which contains
requirements as to the nationality of private claimants, or as to their prior exhaustion of
local remedies, the claims as such are perhaps subject to no impediment but the forum
seized is lacking one of the elements required to give it life in the first place. For such

a tribunal these are matters of jurisdiction.” (emphasis added)

Contrary to the view expressed by the majority, the plain meaning of pages 616 and 617
of the article, when read as a whole, appears to point clearly in favour of the conclusion
that an “ephemeral tribunal” such as this one will have no jurisdiction where a

requirement to have recourse to national remedies has not been met.

For these reasons, and in the absence of any other arguments put forward by the majority,
T agree with the view put forward by both parties: the absence of prior recourse to the

national courts of Turkmenistan means that this Tribunal is without jurisdiction.

Recourse to the Turkmen courts

Having concluded that Article VII(2) goes to the admissibility of a claim, rather than the
jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, the majority concludes that the Claimant’s claims are
not inadmissible for a failure to comply with the domestic litigation requirement in
Article VII(2) of the BIT. This is notwithstanding the undisputed fact that the Claimant

never submitted the dispute it has brought to this Tribunal to the courts of Turkmenistan.

The majority concludes that “it would not be appropriate now to require that the Claimant
first submit the present dispute to local courts” (Award, para. 263). To reach that
conclusion, it takes the view that local court proceedings have already been conducted in
the context of the present dispute, as summarized at paragraph 252 of the Award, and
that “essential aspects of the dispute have in fact been submitted to and litigated before
the Turkmen courts, with the result that seven out of the thirteen contracts at issue in this
arbitration, including all those that were still ongoing at the time, were terminated (or
their termination was upheld)” (Award, para. 262). The majority notes that the

proceedings were brought by the Turkmen authorities and not the Claimant, that seven

out of the thirteen contracts at issue in this arbitration were considered to be terminated,
and that it is “unclear” why the Claimant failed to participate effectively in the
proceedings. Notwithstanding these points, the majority concludes that “the subject
matter, or the fundamental basis, of the dispute had already been litigated ‘before the
courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute””, as required by Article VII(2)
(Award, para. 262).

The approach taken by the majority is troubling. On its face, Article VII(2) makes clear
that two requirements are to be met: (1) the claim is to be brought to the national courts
by the “investor concerned”, and (2) the claim there brought is presumably the one that
relates to “the dispute” that is also before the ICSID arbitral tribunal. On its face neither
of these requirements has been met in the present case: first, the Claimant has never
brought any claim to any national court in Turkmenistan; and second, the claims brought
to the national courts by other parties (in relation to some of the thirteen contracts) had
as their essential cause of action a breach of the relevant underlying contract, and did not
not concern any allegation of a violation of the BIT. A third, and rather obvious and
related point, is that six of the thirteen contracts appear never to have been raised before
any national court in Turkmenistan, not for breach of contract or any other cause of

action.

In these circumstances, on the basis of the evidence that is before this Tribunal, and the
arguments raised by the majority, I am unable to agree with the conclusion that the
requirement set forth in Article VII(2) has been complied with. It is not here a matter of
taking an excessively formalistic view of the facts or the law, but ensuring that the
intentions of the drafters of the BIT — in effect the legislature, in international legal terms
— in imposing an obligation are fully respected by the arbitral tribunal — in effect the
judiciary, in international legal terms - deals thoroughly and completely with the
legislated obligations they have put in place in the BIT. The function of an arbitral
tribunal is to establish the fact and then interpret and apply the law to those facts, not to
decide what is (or is not) “appropriate”. The drafters of the BIT imposed a reasonably
clear obligation, namely that the investor must first take the dispute that it wishes to take

to arbitration to the national courts, and in circumstances in which that has plainly

not happened it is difficult to see the basis upon which an arbitral tribunal could then be
free to dispense with the obligation. This is all the more so where the Tribunal has ruled
that “the BIT does not provide for any “futility exception” to the local litigation
requirement in Article VII(2) of the BIT”, and has not been persuaded that it would

have been futile to bring the case to the Turkmen courts (Award, para. 260).

This aspect of the case touches upon a related matter. The dispute that has given rise to
these proceedings is, in my view, manifestly about obligations arising under thirteen
contracts between the Claimant and Turkmenistan, and whether or not those obligations
have been complied with, on both sides. The BIT in issue does not provide for the
jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal over mere contractual disputes. One of the more
striking aspects of the case is the failure of the Claimant to have recourse to the dispute
settlement mechanism set forth in those contracts, which mandated recourse exclusively
to the national courts, coupled with its failure to keep decent records. Having made its
choice, the Claimant can hardly be surprised at the obstacles it has faced before an
ICSID tribunal. When the parties to a contract have agreed on a national forum for the
resolution of disputes relating to that contract, and that national forum is by-passed,
they can hardly expect matters that appear to be essentially of a contractual nature will
easily be treated as breaches of treaty (and ones requiring proof of the unlawful
exercise of puissance publique). This is all the more so where the evidential record on
which the claim is brought is as flimsy and inadequate as the one before this Tribunal.
The ICSID system is not, and was never intended to be, an insurance against mere

contractual failures.
