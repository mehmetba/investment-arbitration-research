INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”), on the basis of the Energy Charter
Treaty, which entered into force on 16 April 1998 for the Netherlands and the Kingdom
of Spain (the “ECT”), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October
1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The Claimants are NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V (“NextEra Global’), and
NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V. (“NextEra Spain”), both limited liability
companies incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands (besloten vennootschap met

beperkte aansprakelijkheid), (together, “Claimants”).
The Respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain” or “Respondent”).

Claimants and Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

This dispute relates to measures implemented by Respondent modifying the regulatory

and economic regime of renewable energy projects.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

REGISTRATION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

On 15 May 2014, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration dated 12 May 2014,
accompanied by exhibits C-001 to C-012, from Claimants against Spain (the “Request
for Arbitration”). On 21 May 2014, the Centre formulated a question to Claimants
regarding the Request for Arbitration, and Claimants submitted a response on 22 May
2014.

On 23 May 2014, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, the
Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration, as supplemented by

1

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 32 of 265

letter of 22 May 2014, and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of
Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral
tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure

for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the “Institution Rules”).

In accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Parties agreed to
constitute the Tribunal as follows: three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party,
and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. Pursuant
to the Parties’ agreed method of constitution, failing an agreement of the Parties on the
presiding arbitrator, s/he would be appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID

Administrative Council without limitation to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators.

The Tribunal is composed of Professor Donald M. McRae, a national of Canada and New
Zealand, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Mr. L. Yves Fortier, a national
of Canada, appointed by Claimants; and Professor Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, a

national of France and Switzerland, appointed by Respondent.

On 23 January 2015, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID Arbitration Rules’), the Secretary-General of
ICSID notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and
that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Luisa
Fernanda Torres, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the

Tribunal.

THE FIRST SESSION

On 15 May 2015, a date agreed by the Parties, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration
Rule 13(1) the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties in-person in Washington, DC.

On 21 May 2015, following the First Session, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.
1, supplemented on 3 June 2015 with its Annex A (Procedural Calendar). Procedural
Order No. 1 embodied the Parties’ agreements on procedural matters and the Tribunal’s
decisions on the disputed issues. It established, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration

Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages would

2

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 33 of 265

be English and Spanish, that the place of proceeding would be Washington, DC, and it

also set out the Procedural Calendar for this arbitration.

Hearing Reply, and 8 March 2017, Respondent filed its Post-Hearing Reply.”

On 11 May 2017, Claimants submitted an application seeking authorization to add one
additional legal authority to the record, namely: Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energia
Solar Luxembourg S.a r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain, \CSID Case No. ARB 13/36, Award (4
May 2017) (“Eiser Award”) in Spanish, requesting an order to Spain to provide the

 

1098:8.

 

3 Following the Tribunal’s instructions and Procedural Order No. 1, § 12.3, once both Parties’ submissions had
been received by the Secretary of the Tribunal, they were transmitted simultaneously to both Parties and the
Tribunal on 8 March 2017. On 10 March 2017, the Tribunal indicated that it would respond to the requests made in
these Post-Hearing submissions in due course, but in the circumstances, it decided that it was unnecessary to do so.

English version, and an opportunity to file submissions on this legal authority. On 17 and
18 May 2017, Respondent filed observations in response. On 23 May 2017, the Tribunal
authorized the introduction of the Eiser Award into the record, invited Respondent to
introduce the English version, and afforded the Parties an opportunity to file submissions
on this legal authority. Accordingly, on 30 May 2017, Respondent introduced the Eiser
Award into the record in English and Spanish (without a designated legal authority

number).

Having considered the Parties’ respective positions, on 8 June 2017, the Tribunal
established a schedule for the Parties’ submissions on the Eiser Award, later amended on
6 July 2017. Accordingly, the Parties filed their submissions as follows: on 22 June
2017, Claimants filed observations on the Eiser Award; on 11 July 2017, Respondent
filed response observations on the Eiser Award; on 18 July 2017, Claimants filed reply
observations on the Eiser Award; and on 25 July 2017, Respondent filed rejoinder

observations on the Eiser Award.

On 18 July 2017, Claimants also filed a communication raising a procedural matter
arising out of Spain’s observations on the Eiser Award. Specifically, Claimants observed
“Tt]hat Spain has contended that a proper application of the Eiser award on liability
requires a new and different approach to quantum, excluding each of the measures
referred to in this case as Regulatory Framework II.” While opposing Respondent’s
contention as a matter of principle and substance, and raising procedural objections to the
introduction of a new quantum defence at this stage of the proceeding, Claimants asserted
that “should the Tribunal nonetheless wish to proceed to consider the long-term quantum
impact of Regulatory Framework II, or any of its individual elements, the Claimants
agree with Spain that this would require the parties to provide new expert reports
addressing those calculations, following a procedure that ensures due process [...].”
Following an invitation by the Tribunal, on 25 July 2017, Respondent provided
observations on this matter as part of its rejoinder observations on the Eiser Award. It
asserted inter alia that “the expert reports [...] do not reflect, in any way, the separate
impact of the individual measures disputed by Claimants in this arbitration” and agreed

with Claimants that the quantification of that impact would require new expert reports.

On 25 July 2017, as part of its rejoinder observations on the Eiser Award, Respondent
filed an application to introduce additional documents to the record. On 17 August 2017,
Claimants submitted a response, and on 28 August 2017, Respondent submitted a reply.
On 26 September 2017, the Tribunal authorized the introduction of only some of the
documents to the record, namely: the Notice of Registration of Spain’s annulment
application of the Eiser Award, dated 28 July 2017 and its accompanying cover letter.
Accordingly, on 28 September 2017, Respondent submitted those documents to the
record as exhibits R-464 and R-465S.

On 23 November 2017, Respondent filed an application to introduce an additional
document to the record, namely, the EC Decision on State Aid, Case SA.40348
(2015/NN) (10 November 2017) (“the EC Decision”), and asked the Tribunal to afford
the Parties an opportunity to file submissions in connection therewith. On 29 November
2017, Claimants submitted a response. On 5 December 2017, Respondent submitted a
reply. On 14 December 2017, the Tribunal authorized the introduction of the EC
Decision into the record, and it granted the Parties an opportunity to submit written
submissions in connection therewith. Accordingly, on 15 December 2017, Respondent

submitted the EC Decision, designated as RL-124.
On 8 January 2018, each Party filed its respective submission on the EC Decision.

On 5 March 2018, Claimants filed an application seeking leave to add an additional legal
authority to the record, namely: Novenergia II — Energy & Environment (SCA), SICAR v.
Kingdom of Spain (SCC Case No. 2015/063), Award (15 February 2018) (“Novenergia
Award”). On 9 March 2018, Respondent submitted a response to Claimants’
application, and in turn filed an application seeking authorization to add three additional
legal authorities to the record, namely: the Ruling of the EUCJ in case C-284/16
(Achmea Case) (6 March 2018) (“Achmea Judgment”); Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre
Lecorcier and Michael Stein v. Italian Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/14/3, Award (27
December 2016) (“Blusun Award”), and Mr. Jiirgen Wirtgen, Mr. Stefan Wirtgen, Mrs.
Gisela Wirtgen and JSW Solar (swei) GmbH & Co. KG v. The Czech Republic, PCA
Case No. 2014-03, Award (11 October 2017). On 15 March 2018, Claimants submitted a

response to Respondent’s application. On 21 March 2018, Respondent submitted a reply,
which also added a request to introduce into the record Spain’s request for clarification
and supplementation of the Novenergia Award. On 26 March 2018, the Tribunal ruled
on these applications, authorizing the introduction of the Novenergia Award, the Achmea
Judgment and the Blusum Award into the record, and dismissing the other requests. The
Tribunal also afforded the Parties an opportunity to file submissions on these new legal
authorities. Accordingly, on 28 March 2018, Claimants submitted the Novenergia
Award, as legal authority CL-195; and on 29 March 2018, Respondent submitted the
Achmea Judgment and the Blusun Award, as legal authorities RL-125 and RL-126.

In its application of 9 March 2018 referred to above, Respondent “reserve[d] its right to
request that new expert reports be filed by both parties to determine the real impact of

each of the disputed measures.” This statement was repeated in the reply submission of
21 March 2018. In their 15 March 2018 response, Claimants observed they “consider
that they have provided the expert evidence necessary to quantify their damages resulting
from Spain's violations of the ECT.”** In its ruling of 26 March 2018, the Tribunal
observed that “the Tribunal will deal with any such application if and when it is actually

made.”

On 9 April 2018, each Party filed its respective submission on the Novenergia Award, the

Blusun Award and the Achmea Judgment.

On 16 April 2018, Claimants filed an application to add an additional legal authority to
the record, namely: Novenergia II — Energy & Environment (SCA), SICAR v. Kingdom of
Spain (SCC Arbitration 2015/063), Procedural Order No. 17 (9 April 2018)
(“Novenergia PO 17”). On 19 April 2018, Respondent filed a response to Claimants’
application, and in turn, it filed its own application seeking leave to (i) introduce a
number of additional documents to the record; (ii) conduct a site visit to Claimants’

domicile; and (iii) file a short expert report addressing the facts referred to in the

24 That said, Claimants also added that “if the Tribunal requires any further assistance in quantifying damages, the
appropriate mechanism for receiving any such evidence would be a request from the Tribunal itself, not a quantum
report submitted as an observation on the Novenergia award.”

application.?> On 23 April 2018, Claimants filed a reply. On 27 April 2018, Respondent
filed a rejoinder. On 2 May 2018, Claimants filed a communication asking the Tribunal
for a brief opportunity to respond to one of the assertions in Respondent’s

communication of 27 April 2018.

On 4 May 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 ruling on the above
referenced applications. The Tribunal (i) authorized the introduction of the Novenergia
PO17, and the Novenergia Annulment Notice of Registration into the record; and (ii) it
rejected the requests to add other documents to the record, conduct a site visit and to file
an additional expert report. Accordingly, on 9 May 2018, Claimants submitted the
Novenergia PO 17, as legal authority CL-196; and on 6 June 2018, Respondent submitted

the Novenergia Annulment Notice of Registration, as exhibit R-466.

On 16 May 2018, the EC submitted a communication stating that “in case the Tribunal
would deem that useful for its deliberations, the Commission would be available to up-
date its written observations in the light of the recent judgment of the European Court of
Justice in Case C-284/16 Achmea v Slovak Republic, and in particular to set out its view
on the consequences of that judgment for pending arbitration cases based on the Energy
Charter Treaty” (“EC Second Application”). The communication was transmitted to

the Parties and the Tribunal on 17 May 2018.

Following an invitation from the Tribunal, on 23 May 2018, each Party filed observations

on the EC Second Application.

On 29 May 2018, the Tribunal ruled on the EC Second Application. Noting that “the
Parties have already provided comprehensive comments on the Achmea decision
including comments on the implications of the decision for arbitration cases based on the
Energy Charter Treaty” (supra, J 84), the Tribunal ruled that it did not need an update of

the EC Written Submission, and so informed the EC and the Parties.

°5 That is, to demonstrate that (i) “[s]ome impairments that the Solar thermal Plants recorded initially after the
measures have been, due to updated valuations, reversed” and “{...] the PTEs are not in liquidation anymore but
are ‘going concern’”; (ii) the “[d]amages calculated by Compass Lexecon have been discredited and are speculative
and therefore unproven” and (iii) the “[lJack of economic activity of the Claimants in the Netherlands and
everywhere else persists.” Resp. Letter, 19 April 2018; Resp. Letter, 27 April 2018.

On 28 September 2018, the Parties submitted their respective Statements of Costs. On 11
October 2018, Respondent filed a request for support of certain assertions in Claimants’
Statement of Costs; on 17 October 2018, Claimants provided observations in response;
and on 23 October 2018, Respondent filed a reply accepting that the matter could be
resolved through a letter from Claimants’ counsel. On 26 October 2018, the Tribunal
wrote to the Parties, noting that it understood the matter had been resolved and needed no
ruling from the Tribunal. On 29 October 2018, Claimants’ counsel provided the letter
requested by Respondent.

On 25 January 2019, Respondent filed an application seeking authorization to add an
additional legal authority to the record, namely, the “Declaration of the Representatives
of the Government of the Member States of 15 January [2019] on the Legal
Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on Investment
Protection in the European Union,” and to authorize the Parties to file written
submissions addressing this declaration. Following an invitation from the Tribunal, on
31 January 2019, Claimants filed a response. On 5 February 2019, the Tribunal
authorized Respondent to introduce into the record the full set of declarations issued by
the EU Member States in January 2019. On 20 February 2019, Respondent introduced
the EU Member States Declarations into the record as legal authorities RL-127 to RL-
129.

INTRODUCTION

This case concerns a project for the construction of two concentrated solar power
(‘CSP”) plants in Navalvillar de Pela (Badajoz) in the autonomous community of
Extremadura in Spain by the Claimants, known as Termosol | and Termosol 2 (together,
the “Termosol Plants”).2° The dispute revolves around measures implemented by
Respondent modifying the regulatory and economic regime of renewable energy projects

in Spain and their effect on the Claimants’ investments.

The Claimants were incorporated in the Netherlands in 2008. NextEra Energy Global
Holdings B.V. (“NextEra Global”) was incorporated on 27 March 2008;7” while
NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V. (‘“NextEra Spain’) was incorporated on 7 May
2008.78

NextEra Global is the 100% owner of NextEra Spain, which is the 100% owner of the
Spanish company NextEra Energy Espaiia S.L.U. (“NEE Espaiia”), which in turn is the
100% owner of the Spanish companies Planta Termosolar de Extremadura, S.L.U.
(“PTE”), Planta Termosolar de Extremadura 2, S.L.U. (“PTE2”), and NextEra Energy
Espafia Operating Services, S.L.U (“NEEOS”). The PTEs own and operate the Termosol

Plants.”?

Since 2011, NextEra Global has been 100% owned by the Netherlands corporation
NextEra Energy Global Holdings Cooperative U.A., which in turn is a subsidiary of

Claimants contend that “[a]jier the Claimants’ Spanish companies had irrevocably
committed to constructing the Termosol Plants and had spent around 750 million euros
substantially completing construction, Spain completely and retroactively altered the

remuneration regime applicable to the Termosol Plants [...].”>!

With this context, the Tribunal now proceeds to describe the regulatory framework for
renewable energy investments in Spain, in particular for CSP investments, its evolution
and the measures that have given rise to this dispute. The Tribunal will then describe the

Claimants’ investments in Spain.

THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY INVESTMENTS

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the Parties agree that the Spanish system
is formed by different types of instruments, namely, the Spanish Constitution, Organic
Laws, Ordinary Laws, Royal Decree-Laws (“RDL”), Royal-Decrees (“RD”), Ministerial
Orders and Resolutions.** It is also agreed that an RDL has the force of a Law, it may be
enacted by the Executive branch in extraordinary and urgent circumstances, and it must
be ratified by the Legislative branch;*? an RD also emanates from the Executive, and it is
of lower hierarchy vis-a-vis Laws and RDLs;* and a Ministerial Order is a regulation
adopted by one of the different Ministries, lower in the legislative hierarchy than RDs.*>
Respondent has also submitted that Resolutions are instruments which emanate from

competent Government bodies, lower in the hierarchy than Ministerial Orders.*°

(1) The Initial Framework

Within the context of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (“UNFCC”), on 11 December 1997 a number of nations adopted the Kyoto

Protocol, an international agreement committing its Parties by setting internationally

binding greenhouse emission reduction targets.*” The Protocol was signed by Spain on
29 April 1998, and ratified on 31 May 2002.°* It entered into force on 16 February
2005.

101. On 14 May 1997, the European Commission issued Communication COM(97) 196,
setting a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by year 2010, vis-a-vis the

levels existing in year 1990.*°

a. The Electricity Law

102. In the above context, on 27 November 1997, Spain enacted Law 54/1997 on the
Electricity Sector (“Electricity Law” or “Law 54/1997”),"' which regulated the activities
for the provision of electricity in Spain.*? The Electricity Law distinguished between
electricity generation under an “Ordinary Regime” (Title IV, Chapter I), and under a

“Special Regime” (Title IV, Chapter II).

103. Pursuant to Article 27 of the Electricity Law, electricity generation activities were
considered part of the Special Regime in a number of categories listed by the law,
“whenever they [were] carried out from facilities having installed capacity of no more
than 50 MW.” The categories listed included facilities where “non-consumable

renewable energies, bio-mass or biofuels of any type are used as primary energy,

provided their holder [did] not engage in generation activities under the ordinary
regime.”

Article 30 of the Electricity Law established the rights and obligations of producers under
the Special Regime.** Those obligations included, among others, “[t]o comply with
technical generation standards as well as with the standards governing transport and the
technical management of the system;” and “[t]o provide the Authorities with information
concerning the generation, consumption and sale of energy and on any other points as

determined.”** Article 30(4) of the Electricity Law provided that:

“4. [...] the generation of electricity via renewable energy sources (other
than hydroelectric), biomass and also hydroelectric power stations with
capacity of equal to or less than 10 MW will receive a premium to be set
by the Government, so that the price of the electricity sold by these
facilities will fall within a range of between 80% and 90% of the average
electricity price, to be calculated by dividing the income generated by
invoicing for electricity supplied by the energy supplied.

To calculate the premiums, consideration will be given to the voltage level
where the energy enters the network, to the effective contribution to
environmental improvement, primary energy savings and energy
efficiency, and to any investment costs that may have been incurred, in
order to achieve reasonable profitability rates by reference to the cost of
money in capital markets.

On an exceptional basis, for solar energy, the Government shall be able to

set a premium in addition to the limits defined in this article.”*°
Article 31 of the Electricity Law required facilities in the Special Regime to register in an

106. On 23 December 1998, Spain enacted Royal Decree 2818 (“RD 2818/1998”),°° to
regulate the requirements and procedures to qualify for the Special Regime, the
procedure for registration, the conditions for delivery of electricity and the applicable
economic regime.*! Article 9 established the Administrative Registry for Production
Facilities under the Special Regime (“Registro Administrativo de Instalaciones de
Produccién en Régimen Especial” or “RAIPRE”).*? Article 23 provided for a “premium
or incentive” in addition to the market price, for facilities with power (potencia) equal to
or less than SOMW that were registered in the RAIPRE.** Article 32 established that the

premiums would be revised every four years.™*

107. The Electricity Law required that, “[i]n order for renewable energy sources to cover at
least 12% of Spain’s total energy demand by the year 2010,” a plan should be “drawn up

to promote renewable energies and whose objectives shall be taken into account in the

setting of premiums.” Accordingly, on 30 December 1999, Spain’s Council of

Ministers approved the 2000-2010 Renewable Energy Plan.* That Plan set forth “the

principal elements and guidelines [...] relevant in the articulation of a strategy [...] for

of primary energy in the year 2010.”*"

108. On 27 September 2001, the European Parliament and Council adopted Directive
2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in
the internal electricity market (“2001 Renewable Energy Directive”).** Article 3
required Member States “to take appropriate steps to encourage greater consumption of

electricity produced from renewable energy sources in conformity with the national
959

  

indicative targets [.. Spain’s indicative target for the contribution of electricity

produced from renewable energy sources to gross electricity consumption by 2010 was
set at 29.4. Recital 12 noted that “[t]he need for public support in favour of renewable
energy sources is recognised in the Community guidelines for State aid for environmental
protection [...],” adding that “the rules of the Treaty, and in particular Articles 87 and 88
61

thereof, will continue to apply to such public support.

109. The Electricity Law also required that every year, or when required by special
circumstances, the Government would approve or amend a reference or average
electricity tariff through a Royal Decree. Accordingly, on 27 December 2002, Spain
enacted Royal Decree 1432/2002 (“RD 1432/2002”), which established the

methodology to set the annual reference or average electricity tariff.“

110. On 12 March 2004, Spain enacted Royal Decree 436/2004 (“RD 436/2004”),° which
derogated from RD 2818/1998. RD 436/2004 established a new “methodology for the
updating and systematisation of the legal and economic regime” for production of
electricity under the Special Regime. Pursuant to Article 22, producers under the Special
Regime would have the option to: (i) sell to a distributor under a “regulated tariff”
(“feed-in-tariff” or “FiT”) or (ii) sell on the wholesale market “through the system of
offers and bids managed by the market operator” at a “sale price of the electricity [...]
resulting in the organised market [...] or the price freely traded by the plant operator or
representative, supplemented by an incentive and, as the case may be, by a premium

[...]” (pool + premium”). Both options were “expressed in euro cents per kilo-watt

268

hour;”®* and both were established by reference to a percentage of the annual reference or

average electricity tariff, and therefore subject to market fluctuations. In addition,

Article 40 established that:

“1. During 2006, [...] the tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements
defined in this Royal Decree shall undergo revision. [...]. Every four
years, starting from 2006, a new revision shall take place.

2. The tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from any of
the revisions provided for in this section shall come into force on January
Ist of the second year subsequent to the year that the revision has been
carried out.

3. The tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from any of
the revisions provided for in this section shall apply solely to the plants
that commence operating subsequent to the date of the entry into force
referred to in the paragraph above and shall not have a backdated effect
on any previous tariffs and premiums. [...].”7°

111. On 26 August 2005, Spain’s Council of Ministers approved the 2005-2010 Renewable
Energy Plan,’! which revised the earlier 2000-2010 Renewable Energy Plan. The
revision sought to “maintain[ | the commitment to cover at least 12% of the total energy
consumption in 2010;” and it incorporated the other two objectives for 2010, namely
“29.4% electricity generated using renewable energies and 5.75% biofuels in

transport.”””

112. In August 2005, the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce and the Institute for
the Diversification and Saving of Energy also produced a summary of the 2005-2010
Renewable Energy Plan.”? That summary stated that “different technical and financial
hypotheses [were] considered in order to determine the profitability of typical projects”
and that “[rJeturns were calculated based on an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) measured
in current euros for each project type of close to 7%, financed with equity (before
external finance) and after tax.”™

113. On 15 December 2005, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled and rejected a challenge against
RD 436/2004.”° The Supreme Court held that:

“[...] There is no legal obstacle [...] to prevent the Government, in the
exercise of the regulatory powers and of the broad entitlements it has in a
strongly regulated issue such as electricity, from modifying a specific
system of remuneration so long as this is done within the framework
established by the Electricity Law. {...].”"°

 

114. On 23 June 2006, Spain enacted Royal Decree-Law 7/2006 (“RDL 7/2006”),”” which
adopted certain urgent measures for the energy sector. Article 1(12) afforded producers

in the Special Regime “[p]riority for access to the networks for the transport and

networks.”7*

115. On 25 October 2006, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled on a challenge against some
amendments to RD 436/2004.”” The Supreme Court held:

“THREE — [...] Article 30 of the Electricity Law [...] allows [...]
companies to expect that the fixing of the premiums can be included as a
factor relevant to their obtaining ‘reasonable rates of return with
reference the cost of money in the capital market’ or [...] ‘reasonable
compensation for their investments.’ However the payment regime under
examination does not guarantee to special regime electricity producers
that a certain level of profits or revenues will be unchanged relative to
those obtained in previous years, or that the formulas for fixing the
premiums will stay unchanged.”*®

116. On 14 February 2007, the Spanish Comisién Nacional de Energia (“CNE”) issued
Report 3/2007. That report addressed a proposed Royal Decree “for the regulation of the
generation of electricity under the special regime and of specific facilities using

comparable technologies under the ordinary regime.”*' The report stated:

“Minimise regulatory uncertainty. The CNE understands that
transparency and predictability in the future of economic incentives
reduce regulatory uncertainty, which encourages investment in new
capacity and minimises the cost of financing projects, reducing the final
cost to the consumer. The regulation must offer sufficient guarantees to
ensure that the economic incentives are stable and predictable throughout
the life of the facility, setting in such case, both transparent annual update
mechanisms associated with the evolution of robust indices (such as the
average or reference rate, the CPI, ten-year bonds, etc.), as well as
periodic reviews, for example, every four years, which only affect new
installations, in terms of investment costs, and which may affect the
reduction of costs operation also to existing plants.”*

117. On 20 March 2007, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled on a challenge against RD
2392/2004 which had set the electricity tariff for 2005. The petitioners had asked that
certain provisions of RD 2392/2004 regarding the premiums for 2005 be declared null,
and that RD 2818/1998 and RD 436/2004 be applied instead.*? The Supreme Court held
that:

“Owners of facilities under a Special Regime are not guaranteed the
intangibility of a given benefit or income regime in relation to those
obtained in previous years, nor are they guaranteed the indefinite
permanence of the formulas used to fix premiums.”**

(2) Regulatory Framework I*>
a. RD 661/2007

118. On 25 May 2007, Spain enacted Royal Decree 661/2007 “regulating the activity of
electricity production under the Special Regime’ (“RD 661/2007").8° RD 661/2007
replaced RD 436/2004.°7 According to its Preamble:

“The economic framework established in the present Royal Decree
develops the principles provided in Law 54/1997, of 27 November, on the
Electricity Sector, guaranteeing the owners of facilities under the special

regime a reasonable return on their investments, [...]°8

119. Pursuant to Article 24(1) of RD 661/2007, producers under the Special Regime continued
to have the option to (a) “[s]e/l the electricity to the system through the transport or

price obtained in the organised market or the price freely negotiated by the proprietor or
the representative of the facility, supplemented where appropriate by a premium, in
Eurocents per kilowatt/hour’ (“pool + premium”).®? Producers were allowed to elect
either option for periods of no less than one year, and could change their selected option

with notice of at least one month.”°

Article 2 of RD 661/2007 established categories of facilities, in relation to the primary
energy used, the type of technology and the energy yield. Category b.1.2 covered
“[flacilities which use thermal processes alone for the transformation of solar energy, as
the primary energy, into electricity.’ Those facilities were permitted to employ
equipment which used “a fuel for the maintenance of the temperature of the heat transfer
fluid in order to compensate for a lack of solar irradiation which may affect the planned
delivery of energy,” provided that the generation of electricity from such fuel was less

than 12% of the total production of electricity, or up to 15% in certain circumstances.*!

Article 36 of RD 661/2007 dealt with the tariffs and premiums for solar energy facilities
in category b. With respect to category b.1.2, it provided that “[t]he tariffs and premiums
corresponding to facilities in Category b) shall be as provided in Table 3.” Table 3

and upper limits to the hourly price of the market as defined in this Royal Decree, for
Category b) [...] shall be updated on an annual basis using as a reference the increase in
the RPI [Consumer Price Index] less the value set out in the Additional Provision One
[...],” namely, 0.25% until 31 December 2012 and 0.50% thereafter.°? Article 44(3)
addressed the matter of reviews of tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower and upper

limits in the following terms:

“During the year 2010, on sight of the results of the monitoring reports on
the degree of fulfilment of the Renewable Energies Plan (PER) 2005-2010,
and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4), together
with such new targets as may be included in the subsequent Renewable
Energies Plan 2011-2020, there shall be a review of the tariffs, premiums,
supplements and lower and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree with
regard to the costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree
of participation of the special regime in covering the demand and its
impact upon the technical and economic management of the system, and a
reasonable rate of profitability shall always be guaranteed with reference
to the cost of money in the capital markets. Subsequently a further review
shall be performed every four years, maintaining the same criteria as
previously.

year following the year in which the revision shall have been
performed.”**

For the CSP sector, the economic regime set out in RD 661/2007 would accrue to the first

500 MW of installed capacity.°°

Facilities for the production of energy under the Special Regime were subject to
“compulsory registration” in the RAIPRE.*° Moreover, “the final registration of the
facility in the [RAIPRE]” was a “necessary requirement for the application of the
economic regime regulated under [RD 661/2007] to such facility, with effect from the
first day of the month following the date of the final deed of entry into service of the
facility.”*”

In addition to the economic regime, RD 661/2007 afforded producers under the Special
Regime the rights to “enjoy priority in access and connection to the electricity grid”
under certain conditions set forth in Annex XI of RD 661/2007 or in subsequent
regulations; and the right to sell their electricity output via distribution companies, or to

“sell all or part of their net production by way of direct lines.”°*

On 3 and 9 December 2009, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled and rejected various claims
brought by renewable energy producers against certain provisions of RD 661/2007.”
Among others, the petitioners had argued that the first transitory provision of RD

661/2007 was in breach of Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004.!°

Energy Directive”).'°!

This new directive set a “target of at least a 20 % share of
energy from renewable sources in the Community’s gross final consumption of energy in

2020.”1?

Shortly thereafter, on 30 April 2009, Spain adopted Royal Decree-Law 6/2009 (“RDL
6/2009”).!°3 The Preamble of RDL 6/2009 observed that the growing tariff deficit in
Spain, that is, “the difference between collections based on the regulated rates set by the
Administration and paid by consumers for their regulated supplies and access rates set
on the deregulated market and the actual costs associated with those rates” was affecting
the electricity system, putting at risk both “the financial situation of companies in the

electricity sector” and the “sustainability of the system.” '°*

Referring to the growing impact of the Special Regime on the tariff deficit, one of RDL
6/2009’s stated objectives was the introduction of measures to control the cost of that

Special Regime and thereby the tariff deficit.!°

Expressing concern for the financial
viability of facilities already finalized, RDL 6/2009 also indicated that it was “necessary
to adopt a measure of urgency to guarantee the necessary legal security for those who

ha{d] made investments.”!°

RDL 6/2009 put in place a Mechanism of Registration of Pre-assignment of Payment for
the Special Regime Installations (“Mecanismo de Registro de Pre-asignacién de
Retribucién para las Instalaciones del Régimen Especial”) (“Pre-Assignment
Registry”).!°’ Article 4(2) of RDL 6/2009 provided that enrolment in the Pre-

A(8) provided that facilities registered in the Pre-Assignment Registry had a deadline of
36 months to be definitely registered in the RAIPRE, absent which “their economic right

associated with inclusion in the [Pre-Assignment Registry] shall be revoked.”!!°

131. Pursuant to the 4" transitory provision of RDL 6/2009, installations had a deadline of 30
days from entry into force of the RDL to submit their application for entry into the Pre-
Assignment Registry (i.e. until 6 June 2009).''!! In turn, the 5" transitory provision
established that if the capacity of the projects registered in the Pre-Assignment Registry
exceeded the objectives set in RD 661/2007:

“[...] the economic system established in [...] Royal Decree 661/2007 [...]
will be applicable and will be exhausted through those registered
installations. In this case, by means of a resolution from the Council of
Ministers at the initiative of the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and
Commerce, annual restrictions may be established on the commissioning
and start-up of the registered facilities and their prioritization, to avoid
compromising the technical and economic sustainability of the system,
appropriately extending the maximum term established in Article 4.8 of
this Royal Decree-Law, if applicable. [...].” |"

132. On 13 November 2009, the Spanish Council of Ministers entered into an Agreement to
“establish [ ] the order of priority of the projects or plants presented to the administrative
registry for pre-allocation of payment for the installations for the production of electrical
energy, as established in [RDL 6/2009] [...].” (‘Agreement of the Council of
Ministers”).''> At the time, there had been 104 applications to the Pre-Assignment

the Agreement of the Council of Ministers of 13 November 2009.”'?!

Article 2 of RD 1614/2010 reduced the allowed operating hours of plants qualifying for
the Special Regime. For CSP plants of 9-hour storage, those hours were set at 4,000 a

year.!?? Article 2(3) went on to provide that:

“[...] The equivalent hours of reference envisaged in the preceding table
shall not be revisable during their operating life for those facilities
registered definitively in the [RAIPRE as] of 7 May 2009 and for those
registered in the [Pre-Assignment Registry] under the aegis of the fourth
transitional provision of [RDL 6/2009], and which fulfil the obligation
envisaged in Article 4.8 thereof, extended until 31 December 2013 for
those facilities associated with phase 4 envisaged in the [Agreement] of

In turn, Article 3 required projects to opt for the regulated “feed-in-tariff’ option for the

first twelve months of operation. !74

RD 1614/2010 also allowed, under certain conditions, Special Regime facilities
registered in the Pre-Assignment Registry classified under phases 2 to 4, to begin
discharging energy to the grid on a trial basis 9 months before the 1 January applicable to
their respective phases. '?° In this case, the decree also established that the “calculation of
the period during which the facility shall have the right to a premium or equivalent
premium, shall take place as of the starting date of the collection of the premium or
equivalent premium, as appropriate.”'?° RD 1614/2010 further provided that facilities

(3) Other Developments in 2010-2012

a. RDL 14/2010
On 23 December 2010, Spain adopted Royal Decree-Law 14/2010 (‘RDL 14/2010”), to
adopt certain “wrgent measures for the correction of the tariff deficit in the Electricity
Sector.’'8 — According to RDL 14/2010, since RDL 6/2009 there were supervening
circumstances that had a direct impact on the tariff deficit exceeding the maximum deficit
limits set forth in RDL 6/2009.'?° Article 1 of RDL 14/2010 (which amended Article 15

of the Electricity Law), provided that “[c]ompensation for regulated activities shall be

financed through revenues collected by access fees for transmission and distribution

networks, fully paid by consumers and producers.” °°

b. Law 2/2011

On 4 March 2011, Spain enacted Law 2/2011.'5! The stated purpose of the law was to

“introduc{e] in the legal order the structural reforms necessary to create conditions to

favour a sustainable economic development.”'>* Article 78 established “[a] minimum

national goal of 20% [...] for the participation of renewable energies in gross energy
consumption for the year 2020.”'*> Articles 77-79 dealt with principles of energy policy;
national objectives for energy saving and efficiency and renewable energies; and aspects

of indicative energy planning.'**

In 11 November 2011, Spain’s Council of Ministers approved the 2011-2020 Renewable

Energy Plan.'*> Its purpose was to “establish{, ] objectives in accordance with [the 2009

142. On 19 December 2011, S.E. Mariano Rajoy gave an inaugural address to Congress as re-
elected Prime Minister. Referring to an accumulated tariff deficit of EUR 22,000 million,
and observing that “[e]/ectricity tariffs for domestic consumers are the third most
expensive in Europe, and the fifth highest for industrial consumers,” Prime Minister

Rajoy stated that:

“[...] If reforms are not made, the imbalances will be unsustainable, and
increases in prices and tariffs will place Spain at the greatest
disadvantage in terms of energy costs in the entire developed world. We
must therefore introduce policies based on putting a brake on and
reducing the average costs of the system, take decisions without
demagoguery, employ all the technologies available, without exception,
and regulate with the competitiveness of our economy as our prime
objective.” 37

 

143. On 28 December 2011, the CNE issued a press release concerning “the review of grid
access fees and certain tariffs and premiums for facilities operating under the special

regime.” '*8 The CNE referred to:

“[...] the need to immediately implement, amongst other measures,
proposals for the regulation of activities, aimed at getting rid of the
system’s structural deficit and mitigating debt financing costs.
Notwithstanding, to attain sufficiency it would be necessary to make
larger scale additional adjustments to the costs of the activities regulated
and to the tolling paid by consumers. An analysis could also be carried
out of the introduction of measures to finance the costs of activities
regulated externally to the access tolling.” '°

ce RDL 1/2012

On 27 January 2012, Spain adopted Royal Decree-Law 1/2012 (“RDL 1/2012”), which

“suspendjed] the procedure for the pre-assignment of payment and removed] the

financial incentives for new electricity generating facilities generating using

cogeneration, renewable energy sources and waste.”'*° RDL 1/2012 applied to facilities
that had not been registered in the Pre-Assignment Registry by the time RDL 1/2012

entered into effect, namely, 28 January 2012.'4!

On that same day, the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism issued a press release
stating that, the decree had been adopted “to temporarily suspend” the Pre-Assignment
Registry procedures and the economic incentives for new renewable energy installations,
“until a reform in the electric system is implemented that avoids the tariff deficit from

142

being generated [...]

On 27 April 2012, Spain approved its National Reform Program for 2012, which
included a section discussing “measures directed towards solving the existing imbalance

between revenue and costs of the electricity system.”'*8

In 2012, Spain undertook a series of additional reforms to the legal and economic regime

for renewable energy investments.
(4) Regulatory Framework II

a. Law 15/2012

On 27 December 2012, Spain enacted Law 15/2012 “On Tax Measures for Energy

receives for the electric power production and its incorporation into the electricity
system, measured at the power station busbars, for each installation, during the tax

period.” "7

b. RDL 2/2013

On 1 February 2013, Spain enacted Royal Decree-Law 2/2013 (“RDL 2/2013”), adopting
“urgent measures in the electricity system and in the financial sector.”'*® RDL 2/2013,

adopted the following measures:

First, it amended the inflation index applicable under the Special Regime, from the
Consumer Price Index to the “Consumer Price Index at constant rates without

unprocessed food or energy products.” °

Second, it amended Article 36 of RD 661/2007 (Table 3), such that the reference

premium for renewable energy under the Special Regime was set at zero (0).'*°

Third, Article 3 provided that Special Regime facilities that as of the effective date of
RDL 2/2013 (i.e. 2 February 2013)!°! had opted for the pool + premium option under
Article 24(1)(b) of RD 661/2007 could not subsequently change that option.'** Further,

February 15, 2013.” If they did so, however, they would have to “adhere to said option
under the conditions regulated in [RDL 2/2013]” and in consequence could not change

that option thereafter.'°3

On 19 February 2015, the Spanish Constitutional Court dismissed a constitutional
challenge against RDL 2/2013;!™4 and on 26 March 2015, the Spanish Supreme Court
also dismissed a petition asking it to bring a motion for unconstitutionality of RDL
2/2013 before the Constitutional Court.'*

(5) Regulatory Framework III
a. RDL 9/2013

On 12 July 2013, Spain enacted Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 (“RDL 9/2013”) on
“emergency measures to guarantee the financial stability of the electrical system.”!°°

RDL 9/2013 repealed RD 661/2007, and certain provisions of RDL 6/2009.'%”

RDL 9/2013 substituted the prior remuneration regime for renewable energy facilities for

a new one, applicable both to new and existing installations.

Under the new regime, renewable energy producers receive: (i) a payment of the
wholesale market price for the electricity produced (“Market Payment”); (ii) a payment
per Mwh of electricity produced to compensate operating costs not covered by the market

price (“Operating Payment”); and (iii) and a payment per MWh of installed capacity on

“installation type” (“instalacion tipo”) (‘Investment Payment”).'** The remuneration
would be calculated on the basis of standard income for the sale of electricity, standard
exploitation costs and a standard value of the initial investment.'° RDL 9/2013 also

provided that the parameters of the regime could be revised every six years.'

According to RDL 9/2013, the “reasonable profitability” for facilities that as of the
effective date of RDL 9/2013 “had a right to a premium economic regimen [...] shall,
before taxes, be in function of the mean yield on State Bonds on the secondary market for
the ten years preceding the effective date of this royal decree-law plus 300 basis points”
and “without prejudice to the revision provided in the last paragraph of’ Article 30(4) of
Law 54/1997. !¢!

RDL 9/2013 entered into effect on 14 July 2013.'©? At that time, however, neither the
standard reference plant categories, nor the values of the Investment Payment and the
Operating Payment for each category had been determined. As a result, the feed-in-tariff
regime of RD 661/2007 (but not the pool + premium option already abolished by RDL
2/2013) continued operating until June 2014, when further regulatory measures (RD
413/2014 and Ministerial Order IET 1045/2014, discussed further below) were published.
The payments received during this transitional period were made, however, as a

“payment on account’ of the payments that would be received under the new regime.!®

b. Law 24/2013

On 12 September 2013, the Spanish Council of State issued an opinion (Dictamen) on the

draft of a new Electricity Law.'®

On 26 December 2013, Spain adopted Law 24/2013 on the Electricity Sector, which

6

eliminated the distinction between the Ordinary and the Special Regimes.'® It re-

affirmed and developed the regime set forth in RDL 9/2013.

Article 14(4) provided that the “payment parameters” for renewable energy projects
under the new regime were set for regulatory periods of six-years, which could be revised
before the start of the next regulatory period. It set forth certain guidelines for the
“modification of the payment parameters” applicable to renewable energy facilities,
including that (i) in each regulatory period revision “modifications may be made to all
payment parameters;’ and between those periods “the value on which reasonable
profitability will depend” can also be modified; (ii) once established, “the regulatory
useful life or the standard value of the initial investment of a facility” cannot be modified;
(iii) estimates of income for the sale of energy will be revised every three years, and the
payment parameters adjusted in response to market price fluctuation vis-a-vis the prior
three year estimate; and (iv) annual revisions of payment values for technologies whose

operating costs depended on fuel prices. '°7

Article 14(7) of Law 24/2013 provided for the creation of a specific remuneration regime
under which remuneration would be calculated on the basis of standard income from the
energy produced, standard operating costs and a standard initial investment figure, and

will provide a reasonable return for the installation type in each applicable case. !°

In addition, Article 19 of Law 24/2013 established that “deviations occurring between

electricity system income and costs” that are “not offset positively via the access tariffs

182. As to jurisdiction, Claimants have asked the Tribunal to:

“[...] [D]eny each of Spain’s preliminary objections; uphold its
jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims; and render the relief requested in
Part VII of the Claimants’ Memorial and Part IX of the Reply
Memorial.” '°

183. Respondent, in turn, has asked the Tribunal:

Claimant or, where applicable, their inadmissibility, pursuant to the
provisions of the Statement of Objections to Jurisdiction of the Kingdom of
Spain dated 9 September 2015;

b) Additionally, should the Arbitral Tribunal decide that it has jurisdiction
to hear this dispute, dismissing all of the intentions [sic] of the Claimant
insofar as the merits, as the Kingdom of Spain has in no way been in
breach of the ECT, as indicated in Section III of this Memorial, referring
to the Merits;

c) Additionally, dismissing all of the claims regarding reparation of
damages of the Claimant, as it is not entitled to compensation, pursuant to
the provisions of Section IV of this Writ; and

d) Ordering the Claimant to pay all costs and expenses arising from this
arbitration, including the ISCID [sic] administrative expenses, the
arbitrators' fees and the attorneys' fees of the Kingdom of Spain, its

In the Reply on Jurisdiction, Respondent formulated its request for relief in slightly

different terms, asking the Tribunal to:

“a) declare its lack of jurisdiction to hear the claims of the Claimants, or
if applicable their inadmissibility, in accordance with what is set forth in
Section III of this Memorial, referring to Jurisdictional Objections; and

d) Sentence [sic] the Claimants to pay all costs and expenses derived from
this arbitration, including ICSID administrative expenses, arbitrators’
fees, and the fees of the legal representatives of the Kingdom of Spain,
their experts and advisors, as well as any other cost or expense that has
been incurred, all of this including a reasonable rate of interest from the
date on which these costs are incurred and the date of their actual
payment.”!°

 

The Parties’ positions are summarized in the various sections below. At the outset, the
Tribunal emphasizes that it has considered the entirety of the Parties’ arguments in their
written and oral submissions, irrespective of whether an argument is mentioned expressly

in the summaries of the Parties’ respective positions included in this Decision.

which was ultimately withdrawn). The order in which these objections were presented

was explicitly adjusted later in the Reply on Jurisdiction.'*” In the sequence presented in

the Reply on Jurisdiction, the objections are:

e First, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae and ratione personae,
because Claimants do not own or control directly or indirectly the claimed
investments in this case, and therefore there is no “/nvestment” for purposes of
Article 1(6) of the ECT; nor are Claimants “/nvestors” under the definition in
Article 1(7) of the ECT, and in consequence, there is no “Jnvestment” under the
ECT either. !°*

e Second, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione voluntatis, because pursuant to
Article 17 of the ECT, in the Memorial on Jurisdiction Respondent denied the
application of Part III of the ECT to Claimants. !°

. Third, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae because Claimants are
not protected investors under the ECT, as the ECT is not applicable to disputes
between a European Union (“EU”) Member State, and nationals of another EU
Member State (“‘intra-EU” disputes).?”

e Fourth, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione voluntatis to hear Claimants’
claim for breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT regarding a tax measure established in
Law 15/2012, i.e., the TVPEE, because pursuant to Article 21 of the ECT, Article
10(1) does not apply to taxation measures.”"! This is a partial objection.7°?

. Fifth, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear Claimants’ claims for breach of
Article 10(7) of the ECT regarding the TVPEE, because (i) pursuant to Article
21(3) of the ECT, Article 10(7) does not apply to this measure; and (ii) in any
event, Article 10(7) cannot apply to impose most-favored-nation obligations.?°

First OBJECTION: LACK OF JURISDICTION RATIONE MATERIAE AND RATIONE
PERSONAE— LACK OF AN INVESTMENT AND AN INVESTOR

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Respondent’s Position
(i) Lack of an “Investment” Under Article 1(6) of the ECT

Respondent contends that the requirement of an “Jnvestment” as the term is defined in
Article 1(6) of the ECT is lacking in this case’? Observing that according to this
provision, “‘Jnvestment’ means every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or
indirectly by an Investor [...],” Spain initially argued that Claimants had neither
ownership nor control over the assets claimed to constitute the investment in this case,?°
namely: (i) a 100% of the shares of NEE Espajia, the Spanish company that in turn owns
three other Spanish companies: PTE, PTE2, and NEEOS; and (ii) a bridge loan granted to
the Termosol Plants by Claimants.?°”
included the indirect participation in PTE, PTE2 and NEEOS.?°*

According to Spain, the alleged investment

Respondent’s initial position was that Claimants’ connection to these assets was
“indirect, and that the notion of indirect ownership in Article 1(6) of the ECT
required finding the “real and ultimate possession of the asset.”'° That, according to
Spain, corresponded to NextEra Energy Inc., Claimants’ U.S. parent company.?!!
Therefore, neither Claimant owned the above-mentioned assets either directly or

212

indirectly. In addition, Respondent argued, the assets were not controlled by

Claimants directly or indirectly as required by Article 1(6) of the ECT and its

 

to extend this objection to claims arising out of Ministerial Order IET/1168/2014 and Ministerial Order
IET/1182/2014, neither of these two measures were mentioned again in the sections developing the objection, Jd., §
18. The objection was expressly withdrawn with the Reply on Jurisdiction. Resp. Reply Jur., n. 1.

corresponding Understanding 3, because the actual control fell again on NextEra Energy

Inc., the U.S. parent company.?!>

Respondent’s position was, however, amended in the Reply on Jurisdiction. There,
Respondent asserted that it had been “able to effectively confirm that by means of certain
internal asset transfer operations, the Claimants currently, formally and indirectly ‘own’
the shares in the Termosol Power Plants,” and stated that, as a result, Respondent was no

214

longer “maintain[ing] that the Claimants do not ‘own’ the assets.

(ii) Lack of an “Investor” Under Article 1(7) of the ECT

This said, Respondent argues that the conceded indirect ownership is insufficient,
because for there to be an “/nvestment” under Article 1(6) of the ECT, the asset must be
owned or controlled by an “Investor” in the sense of Article 1(7).7!° Absent an

“Investor,” there is no “Investment” either.?'®

According to Spain, there is no “/nvestor” under Article 1(7) of the ECT, because Article
1(7)(a)(@ii) refers to “a company or other organization organized in accordance with the
law applicable in that Contracting Party,” and neither Claimant qualifies as a “company

or other organization.”?""

In Spain’s view, the terms “company or organization” should not be equated with “legal
entity,” as confirmed by, the ordinary meaning of those words, EU Law and Netherlands
Law, and a “systematic interpretation” of the ECT.?'*

According to Respondent, in their ordinary meaning the terms company or organization
refer to “associations established according to, or for the performance of, an end or

purpose” that “require the disposition or order of personal and material resources in

order to achieve an end.”?!? Claimants do not meet this ordinary meaning, Spain

contends, because they have no workers, material or technical resources, and are pure

holding companies.?””

195. Respondent also observes that, pursuant to Article 1(7) of the ECT, Claimants must be a
company or organization in accordance with the law applicable in the country where they

are established, i.e. the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, EU Law is applicable and

222

prevails over internal law,”*! or must be considered part of the national law.?”? Referring

to EU notions in the fields of small and medium size enterprises, tax law, competition
law, state aid law and jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union
(“CJEU”) Respondent ultimately contends: “for an entity to be a company under EU
Law, there must be an organisation whose purpose is to provide services or produce

goods on the market. And an entity that simply has shares or stakes in other companies is

not a company. EU Law does not accept that shell companies are undertakings.”??

Accordingly, Spain argues, Claimants are not a company or other organization

established under the applicable law.?**

196. Spain further maintains that the ECT distinguishes between the notions of “company” or
“organization,” and those of “legal entity” or “enterprise,” noting that: (i) Article 17 of
the ECT uses only the expression “/egal entity;’ and (ii) Article 26(7) of the ECT is
drafted as it is to avoid the use of the expression “legal person’ in Article 25(2)(b) of the
ICSID Convention.”

Finally, the object and purpose of the ECT also support this objection, given that “the
Charter and the ECT aspire to promote the investment activity of companies that are
actively involved in the energy market, which cannot be achieved by means of mere

holding companies.”??7

b. Claimants’ Position

Claimants contend that (i) the dispute concerns Claimants’ “Jnvestments” as defined in
Article 1(6) of the ECT;??* and (ii) Claimants are qualifying “/nvestors” under Article
1(7) of the ECT.2”? Claimants point out that Respondent conflates two separate concepts
(‘Investment and “Jnvestor”) within the overall concept of jurisdiction ratione

materiae.*”

(i) Claimants Have an “/nvestment” Under Article 1(6) of the ECT

Answering Respondent’s initial contentions in the Memorial on Jurisdiction, Claimants
argued that they do own protected “/nvestments” in the territory of Spain.?>' According
to Claimants, their investments were precisely identified in their initial submissions,
which referred to “Claimants’ 100% equity shareholding in NEE Espaia.” Claimants
explained that “[t]o the extent that NEE Espaia itself owns assets (such as their 100%
ownership of the PTEs and NEEOS) {...] ‘these are qualifying investments under [...] the
ECT [...] but they are ultimately reflected in the value of the Claimants’ shareholding in
NEE Espaia and the Claimants do not seek double-recovery for those investments.””>>*
In Claimants’ view, that 100% equity interest in NEE Espaiia, directly owned by NextEra
Spain (Claimant 2) and indirectly owned by NextEra Global (Claimant 1),
unquestionably qualifies within Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT.?* It also settled law that an

investor can “claim for harm to the value of its shareholding if the assets of the company

in which it owns shares suffer harm by reason of a State's unlawful conduct.’* For
Claimants, “Spain has not disputed that the Claimants directly or indirectly own 100% of
the issued share capital in NEE Espajia’ the “Investment” identified since the Request

for Arbitration.?°>

Claimants also opposed Respondent’s interpretation of Article 1(6) of the ECT, on the
ground that: (i) it was contradicted by the ordinary meaning of the text, and it would
require reading into the provision a criterion of “ultimate ownership” that was not
there;°° (ii) the discussion of “control” was irrelevant because the express wording of
Article 1(6) refers to two deliberate alternatives (“owned or controlled”);?>" (iii) Article
17 of the ECT did not assist Spain, because that provision necessarily presupposes that an
investor who is not the ultimate owner is prima facie protected until a denial is validly
exercised;”** and (iv) the case law invoked by Spain did not support its position, and in

fact tribunals have routinely accepted claims by intermediary subsidiaries.*”

Given Respondent’s amendment of its position, in the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction
Claimants merely observed that “Spain [...] admits that Claimants’ indirect participation
in the capital of the Termosol Plants” is an “Investment” under Article 1(6) of the ECT,

and focused on the contentions relating to Article 1(7) of the ECT.2°

(ii) Claimants Are “Investors” Under Article 1(7) of the ECT

Observing that Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT defines “/nvestor” as “a company or other
organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party,”
Claimants argue that, by its plain terms this provision imposes no further requirements;?*!

definition.” Claimants assert that the definition is satisfied here because “each of the
Claimants is a company organised in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands” and

the Netherlands is an ECT Contracting Party.?43

In Claimants’ view, Spain’s contentions on the basis of the economic theory of
organizations and concepts in EU tax, competition and state aid law and in the EU
regulations for small and medium enterprises are “inapposite,” “irrelevant,” and
“unconvincing,” and cannot alter the treaty text.“ Moreover, Claimants argue that
Article 17(1) of the ECT does not assist with the interpretation of Articles 1(6) and 1(7)
of the ECT; and further point out that there has been no argument of fraud or malfeasance

in the ownership structure to trigger a debate over veil piercing.**°

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis
a. Lack of an “Investment” under Article 1(6) of the ECT

Article 1(6) of the ECT provides that an “Investment” means “every kind of asset, owned
or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor,” including “a company or business

enterprise.’*"6

Initially Respondent argued that in order to have an investment an investor must own the
assets on which the investment was based, and it was not sufficient just to have a 100%
ownership of the shares of the investment. Respondent also argued that Claimants did
not control the investment. Ownership and control, in Respondent’s view, rested with the
American parent.4” Respondent ultimately accepted that Claimants owned the Spanish
companies and did not pursue the argument that Claimants did not own the investment,

1(7) of the ECT, then they cannot have an “Jnvestment” within the meaning of Article
1(6) of the ECT.”* In the light of the conclusion below relating to Article 1(7) of the

ECT on the meaning of “Jnvestor,” this argument fails.

Thus, the Tribunal rejects Respondent’s objection that the condition of Article 1(6) of the

ECT has not been met.

b. Lack of an “Investor” under Article 1(7) of the ECT

Article 1(7) defines an “/nvestor” of a Contracting Party to include: “a company or other
organization organized in accordance with the law applicable within that Contracting
Party.”

It is not disputed that Claimants, NextEra Global and NextEra Spain are incorporated in
accordance with the law of the Netherlands. Respondent argues, nonetheless, that the
words “company” and “organization” in Article 1(7) have a meaning different from legal
entity. According to Spain, a company must be understood in economic terms and this
means it must be engaged in economic activity itself and not just be a shell company.
Thus, pure holding companies do not meet the requirements of Article 1(7). Respondent
refers to EU Law and the law of the Netherlands in support of its position on the

particular meaning of “company” and “organization.”

However, cases involving Article 1(7) of the ECT have been fairly consistent in
interpreting that provision on the basis of the ordinary meaning of the words, and treating

as decisive the fact that the company is organized within the territory of a Contracting

51

Party. This was the view adopted in Yukos*°° and in Charanne.*>! The same view was

Moreover, in RREEF, Spain advanced similar arguments about the nature of a company
in order to show that the alleged shell company in that case was not an investor within the

meaning of Article 1(7) of the ECT.?>> That argument was rejected.

The Tribunal sees no ground for concluding that Article 1(7) of the ECT must be
interpreted on the basis of a particular meaning under EU or Netherlands law. The ECT
is a treaty and must be interpreted in accordance with the principles of treaty
interpretation set out in Article 31-33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
(‘VCLT”). Under Article 31(1) of the VCLT, treaties are to be given their ordinary
meaning in their context and in light of the object and purpose of the treaty. Applying
that rule, Claimants are companies that are organized under the law of the Netherlands

and thus are “/nvestors” within the meaning of Article 1(7) of the ECT.

Thus, the Tribunal rejects Respondent’s objection that the condition of Article 1(7) of the
ECT has not been met.

SECOND OBJECTION: LACK OF JURISDICTION RATIONE VOLUNTATIS — DENIAL OF
BENEFITS

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione voluntatis as a
result of Respondent’s exercise in the Memorial on Jurisdiction of its right under Article
17 of the ECT to deny the benefits of Part III to Claimants. This is a matter of
jurisdiction, Spain says, because the consent to arbitration given in Article 26(1) of the
ECT refers to disputes that “concern an alleged breach of an obligation [...] under Part
1”?>> In turn, the consequence of a denial of benefits under Article 17 is the “non-

application of Part Ill,” when the conditions set for in the provision are met, as they are

here.?°° Since there can be no obligation under Part III due to the denial of benefits, it
follows that there can be no breach thereof, and consequently there is no consent to

arbitration under Article 26.7°7

(i) | The Requirements of Article 17 of the ECT Are Met

Respondent explains that the requirements of Article 17 of the ECT for exercising a
denial of benefits are met because:?* (i) each Claimant is a legal entity incorporated in
the territory of an ECT Contracting Party other than Spain;?*? (ii) each Claimant is owned
and controlled by citizens or nationals of the United States, a third State not party to the
ECT;? and (iii) neither Claimant performs any business activity in the Netherlands or in
any other country.”°!

Legal Entity Incorporated in the Netherlands. Respondent explains that, should the
Tribunal dismiss the intra-EU objection (infra, § V.C) and instead conclude that the
Netherlands and Spain are separate ECT Contracting Parties, then it should find that
Claimants are legal entities incorporated in the territory of an ECT Contracting Party (the
Netherlands), different from Spain.?~

Owned and Controlled by U.S. Citizens or Nationals. Respondent argues that NextEra
Spain (Claimant 2) is 100% owned by NextEra Global (Claimant 1), in turn 100% owned
by NextEra Energy Global Holdings Cooperative U.A., in turn 99% owned by NextEra
Energy Inc. (formerly known as FPL Group International Inc.), a U.S. company, and 1%
by High Group Investments LLC, a Gibraltar company.”° Further, according to
Respondent, the certificates of the Dutch Registry reflect that NextEra Energy Global
Holdings Cooperative U.A. administers NextEra Global (Claimant 1); while NextEra

Global (Claimant 1) administers NextEra Spain (Claimant 2).7 It follows, Spain says,
that NextEra Energy Inc. is not only the owner, but also the controller of both
Claimants.” This is underscored by the fact that it was the President of NextEra Energy
Inc., Mr. F. Mitchell Davidson, who handled all communications on behalf of the

NextEra Group with the Spanish Government during the investment process.

This said, in Spain’s view, it is incorrect to assert that the requirements of ownership and
control by nationals of a third State in Article 17 of the ECT are cumulative.” It is

sufficient that one of them is satisfied.?°° Moreover, Respondent argues, when referring

to “citizens or nationals of a third state,” Article 17 is looking for the “natural persons”

who own or control the legal person, for the ultimate or beneficial owner.” And in this
case, Spain argues, the “citizens or nationals” who own and control Claimants are in the

United States.?”

As to the notion of “control” in Article 17 of the ECT, Spain argues that it must be
interpreted in accordance with Understanding 3 relating to Article 1(6) of the ECT.

Pursuant to that Understanding, “control of an Investment means control in fact,

271

determined after an examination of the actual circumstances in each situation. Spain

272

also maintains that the burden of proof to establish control is on Claimants;~’~ and argues

that it is incorrect to simply attribute control of NextEra Spain to NextEra Global, and

control of NextEra Global to NextEra Energy Global Holdings Cooperative U.A, since

» 273

the relevant test is “control in fact. In any event, Spain contends that it has been

established that Claimants are controlled by “American citizens,” namely NextEra Energy

Inc. and the staff in the companies in the NextEra Group in the United States, in

management of NextEra in the United States.?”>

also part of the national law of the Netherlands and Spain.”

220. Moreover, Respondent argues, Claimants (i) have no employees of their own, as shown
by their own Commercial Registers at the Chamber of Commerce;?” (ii) have a
registered office that: corresponds to the address of an entity dedicated to the creation and
maintenance of companies (Intertrust Group B.V.), is shared with over 1,000 other

NextEra Group SEC filings.7*> For Spain, they are mere “shell companies” through

which funds flow from the United States to Spain.?*4

Respondent objects to Claimants’ allegation (based in Amfo) that the term “substantial”
in Article 17 of the ECT should be analysed from a qualitative point of view, as opposed
to a quantitative one. In Respondent’s view, this interpretation is in tension with the
Spanish version of Article 17, which uses the term “important” (“importantes”) when
referring to the activities.2°> It is also contrary to the decision in Plama, which

considered the term “substantial” as a quantitative one.?*°

In any event, Respondent
says, Amto does not assist Claimants because the finding of substantial activities there
was based on facts that are not met in this case, namely, the existence of two full time
employees, an office permanently leased, and investments in other countries following
instructions from within the country; while the holding of a bank account was not found

determinative.?°”

(ii) The Denial of Benefits Was Timely and the Effects Can Be Retroactive

Respondent argues that its denial was timely,?**

because (i) there are no provisions in the
ECT regarding timing for the exercise of Article 17;°* (ii) the right can only be exercised
when it is known that it is being invoked, and when Respondent is made aware of the

290

arbitration and the exact characteristics of the alleged investor;*”? and (iii) Spain could

only verify whether the requirements of Article 17 of the ECT were met after receiving

and analysing the Memorial.”*!

It is Spain’s position that the denial of benefits “may be exercised from the moment there

is knowledge of the dispute being submitted, without any prior obligation to communicate

said denial at the beginning of the arbitration or at the time of pre-investment.”??

Respondent observes that Plama relied on Article 1113 of NAFTA, which contains a
requirement of prior communication and prior notification in connection with a denial of
benefits, but has no equivalent in the ECT and it is thus not applicable.?*> The absence of
this provision in the ECT, Spain says, must mean that the intention of the ECT
Contracting Parties was that the denial of benefits could be exercised at any time, given
that other ECT provisions do contain express notice or consultation requirements.?** The
position is also supported by the negotiating history of the ECT, Spain argues. According
to Respondent, during the negotiations the United States had reserved the right to deny
benefits at the time of the arbitration, and it was the United States’ proposal that

ultimately prevailed.?”°

Respondent argues that the dispute in this case arose in 2014, as the first trigger letter was
sent in February 2014 and the Request for Arbitration was filed in May 2014.2 Prior to
that, Spain says, the “only and first” communication sent to Spain revealing the existence
of the Claimants was a letter of 15 March 2012, which for Spain only shows the “opacity
in the business structure of the real investor, NextEra Energy Inc.”?*’ Respondent waited
for the Request for Arbitration, it alleges, in order to have a correct picture of the
structure used by NextEra Energy Inc., all in good faith and in accordance with the
ICSID Arbitration Rules.?°° And Spain did not have all the information to determine

whether Article 17 of the ECT could be triggered until the Memorial was studied.?°

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 98 of 265

In Respondent’s view, both Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID
Arbitration Rule 41(1), together with arbitral case law support the proposition that the
denial of benefits was validly exercised in the Memorial on Jurisdiction.*°° That is
because under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), objections to jurisdiction “shall be made as
early as possible [...] no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of

the counter-memorial [...].”°°!

Spain further objects to the conclusion in Plama that a denial of benefits must be
prospective. Relying on the decisions in Ulysseas and Guaracachi, Spain argues that
Plama has been superseded by subsequent decisions that have allowed the exercise of the
denial of benefits with retroactive effect.*°? For Respondent, limiting the effects of a
denial of benefits to the future amounts to introducing a restriction that is not reflected in

the text of Article 17 of the ECT.

Finally, Spain opposes Claimants’ contention that the form of the denial of benefits in
this case is defective, observing that the form in which the denial was activated here (an
express statement in the Memorial on Jurisdiction) was completely different from that in

Plama, the case on which Claimants rely.°°4

provision is limited to the benefits in Part III of the ECT, and has no impact on the

consent in Part V.°°

229. In addition, Claimants argue, the objection fails for various reasons: (i) Article 17 of the
ECT was not timely invoked; (ii) Spain was aware of Claimants’ corporate structure
several years before this arbitration begun; (iii) Claimants engage in substantial business

activities in the Netherlands; and (iv) Claimants are Dutch owned and controlled.*"°

(i) The Exercise of Article 17 of the ECT Is Untimely and Procedurally
Improper

230. In Claimants’ view, the unanimous body of ICSID awards in ECT cases prevents the
State from denying the benefits of the ECT to an investor after an investment has been

made and a dispute has arisen;*°7 and the non-ECT awards relied upon by Spain are
inapposite.*°* Recognizing that the Tribunal is not bound by earlier decisions, Claimants
observe that stability and predictability are very important in this area.*°” In addition,
Claimants argue, their position is supported by the ordinary meaning and context of
Article 17(1) of the ECT, and the object and purpose of the ECT of promoting “long

term-cooperation in the energy field.”>'°

231. Quoting from the decision in Khan, Claimants argue that the position adopted by the
uniform body of cases makes “eminent sense,” as “ili is difficult to imagine that any
Contracting Party [...] would refrain from exercising its right to deny the substantive

protections of the ECT to an investor who has already commenced arbitration [...]” and

“Ta] good faith interpretation does not permit the Tribunal to choose a construction of
Article 17 that would allow host States to lure investors by ostensibly extending to them
the protections of the ECT, to then deny these protections when the investor attempts to

232. Furthermore, Claimants contend, Spain cannot argue that it only recently acquired
knowledge of the relevant facts giving rise to the denial, because: (i) Spain has known
“Ta]t all times” that the ultimate owner of this investment was a U.S. corporation; (ii)
since 2008 prior to the construction of the Termosol Plants, it has been a matter of public

record that NEE Espafia was owned by NextEra Spain (Claimant 2), a Dutch corporation;

  

and (iii) after NextEra officials in the United States notified Spain of a potential ECT

claim by the Dutch Claimants in 2012, Spain did not invoke its right under Article 17 of

the ECT, and instead, continued to encourage the investments. In particular, Claimants

point out that:

Spanish investments, as also shown in the initial correspondence with high Spanish

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 102 of 265

Finally, Claimants argue, the facts of this case are distinguishable from those relied upon
by Respondent (Guaracachi, Ulysseas and PacRim), where there was no evidence that
the State was aware of the ownership and control before the dispute arose. Indeed,
Claimants say that they are not aware of any decision upholding the validity of a denial of
benefits exercised during the course of an arbitration on the basis of information made

available to the State beforehand.*”7

(ii) The Form of the Denial is Deficient

Relying on Plama, Claimants argue that the denial ought “necessarily be associated with
publicity or other notice,” either through “a general declaration in a Contracting State’s
official gazette [...]; or a statutory provision in a Contracting States’ investment or other
laws; or even an exchange of letters with a particular investor or class of investors.>?>
Plama rejected the State’s exercise of the denial via two communications to the ICSID
Acting Secretary General expressly indicating the intention to exercise Article 17 of the
ECT, and this is analogous to Respondent’s actions in the present case. It follows that the

denial here is invalid as a matter of form.***

In response to Respondent’s contention that the text of Article 17 of the ECT does not
require any prior notification, publication or consultation, Claimants contend that “[t]he
text of Art{icle] 17 of the ECT presupposes that the right reserved therein be expressly
and unambiguously exercised outside the context of an existing arbitration with the
relevant investor, which can only be done through some form of notification, publication

oo 25
or communication.”>>

(iii) The Conditions of Article 17 of the ECT Are Not Met
Claimants contend that Respondent has the burden to prove the two cumulative
conditions of Article 17 of the ECT.*”° Dismissing Respondent’s attempt to shift the

burden to Claimants, they argue that as Article 17 is being raised as an exception to the

applicability of Part III of the ECT, it falls on Respondent to establish that all of the

elements of the exception are met.*?”

In Claimants’ view, this burden has not been
discharged, as in fact: (i) Claimants have substantial business activities in the
Netherlands; and (ii) each Claimant is owned by another Dutch entity, and that ownership

confers control in the ordinary way.??8

Substantial Business Activities. Claimants argue that there is no check-list of mandatory
factors, and the inquiry is qualitative, rather than quantitative, i.e. the decisive question is

the “materiality, not the magnitude of the business activity.”*??

Respondent’s attempt to rely on the different adjectives used in the English and the
Spanish version of the ECT (“‘substantial” and “importantes”) is irrelevant, because both
are met. That said, Claimants argue that as both the English and Spanish texts are equally
authentic, pursuant to Article 33(3) of the VCLT they should be presumed to have the
same meaning. That meaning would be the meaning endorsed by Amto, which is the
common denominator in the various other authentic languages of the ECT.**° Claimants
add that, if the Tribunal is not satisfied, and considers that the authentic texts disclose a
difference of meaning, pursuant to Article 33(4) of the VCLT, the Tribunal must (i)
remove the difference applying Article 31 and 32 of the VCLT, or (ii) should that fail,
adopt the meaning that “best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose
of the treaty.”**' The analysis under either of those steps, Claimants contend, also leads

to the meaning adopted in Amto.***

Claimants argue that they “exceed the standard for ‘substantial business activities,”>*

and have activities in the Netherlands that are quantitatively and qualitatively

substantial.*** This, they say, is demonstrated by the witness statement of Mr. George

Nicolai and documentary evidence, showing that Claimants: (i) are incorporated in the
Netherlands; (ii) have a registered office in Amsterdam, which they have use of, and have
hired a company named Intertrust to provide secretarial and communication facilities;
(iii) hold the vast majority of their board meetings in the Netherlands; (iv) make decisions
within the Netherlands, as the board of NextEra Energy Global Holdings Cooperative
U.A. can only pass resolutions if adopted by majority of both A and B directors present,
and the B directors are Dutch nationals; (v) convene annual general shareholder meetings
in the Netherlands; (vi) have bank accounts in the Netherlands; (vii) are Dutch residents
for tax purposes; (viii) prepare and file statutory annual accounts in the Netherlands; (ix)
have adopted significant business decisions concerning the investments in Spain,
including purchase of equipment, equity injections, causing NextEra Spain to subscribe
the shares in NEE Espaiia, reviewing operations summaries of the Termosol Plants,
appointing auditors, prosecuting claims in this arbitration by hiring counsel, overseeing,
assessing and assisting with the potential sale of NEE Espafia, reviewing debt
restructurings, and dealing with the potential liquidation of NEE Espaiia.**> In addition,
Claimants’ administrative costs for conducting business in the Netherlands exceed
approximately EUR 37,000 per year and the management and corporate secretarial costs
exceed EUR 85,000 per year.**° Furthermore, NextEra Global is also the holding
company for large renewable energy investments in Canada, which is part of the factual
matrix for determining whether this company has substantial business activities in the

Netherlands.*°”

None of the factors referred to by Spain detract from the above substantial business
activities. Many of Spain’s contentions have already been rejected by other arbitral
tribunals.*** There is no rule in investment treaty arbitration against the bona fide use of
holding companies.**? There is a distinction between holding companies — which could

in principle have substantial business activities — and shell companies, and even if the

Tribunal concluded that Claimants are shell companies, there would be no basis to
deprive them of protection, as held in RREEF.*™“° It is also irrelevant that Claimants’
Dutch annual accounts are abbreviated, because they qualify as small companies under
Dutch law and are thus not required to include cash flows or board statements or audit
their accounts.*4! Respondent’s reliance only on the filed accounts is misleading, as the
accounts produced for the shareholders include more detailed information; and Claimants

do hire Dutch auditors.*””

Finally, the code used in the Dutch registry has the sole
purpose of describing the main object of the company at the time of registration; it has no

legal consequences and does not restrict the activities of the entity.*“7

Dutch Ownership and Control. Claimants contend that Dutch ownership is demonstrated
because each Claimant is owned by a Dutch national: NextEra Global (Claimant 1) owns
100% of NextEra Spain (Claimant 2); and a Dutch cooperative owns 100% of NextEra
Global (Claimant 1).*#4 Dutch control is also showed by the fact that no voting
arrangements prevent these owners from “exercising control over their immediate
subsidiary, in the normal way.”*** Moreover, contrary to Spain’s contentions, Claimants”
board of directors is not dominated or controlled by U.S. citizens, as each director has a

free vote and neither of the categories (A or B) plays a more important role.*“°

Claimants also observe that, by contrast with Article 1(6) of the ECT — concerning the
definition of “Investment” — Article 17 does not include any reference to indirect
ownership or control. Accordingly, they say, the ordinary meaning and the context of
Article 17 refer to direct ownership and direct control.*47  Spain’s reliance on
Understanding 3 relating to Article 1(6) of the ECT is a red herring, because, had the
ECT Contracting Parties wished to include within the ambit of Article 17(1) indirect

ownership or control, they could have easily transposed the language from Article 1(6),

and they did not.*** In addition, Claimants say, Spain’s view is inconsistent with the
functions of Article 1(6) and Article 17 of the ECT: the first one provides a broad
definition of “Investment,” while the second one provides limited exceptions to the

general applicability of the ECT to those “/nvestments.>?

(iv) The Denial Can Only Produce Effects to the Future

Finally, Claimants argue that, even if the conditions of Article 17 were met, the denial
could only have effect as of 9 September 2015 (date of the Memorial on Jurisdiction),
when it was raised for the first time; and all the challenged measures in this case occurred

prior to that date.*°"

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Article 17 was invoked by Respondent as a preliminary objection and argued that way.
The Tribunal notes Claimants’ argument that this objection is not really a jurisdictional
objection since it is a challenge only to the application of Part III of the ECT. However,
since the matter has been argued as a preliminary objection, the Tribunal will deal with it

on this basis.
Article 17(1) of the ECT provides:

“Each Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this
Part to:

(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control
such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in
the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized; [...J”>*!
Respondent argues that Claimants are owned and controlled by the American company

NextEra Energy Inc. and do not have substantial business activities in the Netherlands. It

argues that it exercised its right under Article 17(1) to deny the benefits of Part III of the

ECT to Claimants in its Memorial on Preliminary Objections.*>”

The Tribunal will deal first with the question whether Claimants are owned or controlled
by the citizens or nationals of a third State, second with whether they have substantial
business activities in the Netherlands, and third with whether Respondent has exercised

effectively a denial of the advantages of Part III of the ECT under Article 17(1).

a. Are Claimants Owned or Controlled by the Citizens or Nationals of a
Third State?
Claimants argue that they are 100% owned by a Dutch cooperative and control follows
that ownership. The second Claimant, NextEra Spain, is registered in the Netherlands
and is 100% owned by the first Claimant NextEra Global, also registered in the
Netherlands, which in turn is 100% owned by NextEra Energy Global Holdings
Cooperative U.A, which, too, is registered in the Netherlands. On that basis, Claimants
are not controlled by the nationals of a non-ECT State. Nor, Claimants argue, do the
voting arrangements prevent the Dutch owners from exercising control. In any event,
Claimants argue, since there is no reference to “indirect” ownership or “indirect” control
in Article 17(1) of the ECT, the word control in Article 17(1) is limited to “direct”

control.

The Tribunal sees no basis for concluding that control in Article 17(1) of the ECT is
limited to direct control. It is control in fact that counts, just as control in fact is what is
meant in respect of Article 1(6) (Understanding 3). It makes no sense to say that the test
for control in determining whether an investment is controlled by the nationals of another
Contracting Party is different from the test for determining whether an investment is

controlled by the nationals of a third State.

NextEra Energy, Inc., a U.S. corporation is the ultimate principal entity in the NextEra
group and notwithstanding the formal provisions on voting, the reality is that the Dutch
companies are controlled by the American company and the principal activities of

Claimants in respect of the investments in Spain are conducted by the American

company. It was officials of the American companies who dealt with the Spanish
authorities in making the investment and, as will be discussed later, all of the
representations by the Spanish authorities on which Claimants rely for their legitimate
expectations claim in this case were made to those officials. In short, the reality of

control is with U.S. nationals.

In light of this, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants are controlled by the citizens or

nationals of a third State and thus the first criterion in Article 17(1) is met.

b. Do Claimants Have “Substantial Business Activities” in The
Netherlands?
Respondent argues that Claimants do not have any business activities in the Netherlands.
They are essentially holding companies whose function is to hold shares not to conduct
business activities. Claimants argue that there is no barrier to holding companies meeting
the test of having substantial business activities and list a variety of activities which it
claims show that they meet this test, including having a bank account in the Netherlands,
holding meetings there, providing annual accounts and taking decisions on such matters
as equipment and funding of the Spanish subsidiaries. The question according to

Claimants is the materiality of the business activities not the magnitude.

The question of what constitutes “substantial business activities” has been dealt with in
several cases, although not all related to Article 17(1) of the ECT. In Pac-Rim,*® a case
brought under the Central American Free Trade Agreement (“CAFTA”), the tribunal
concluded that there were no “substantial business activities” of the claimant in the
United States. It simply held the shares of other companies. Apparently, it had no board
of directors and no bank account in the U.S. The tribunal did say that a “traditional
holding company” could be engaged in “substantial business activities.” Such a
company in its view would have “a board of directors, board minutes, a continuous

physical presence and a bank account.”***

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 109 of 265

355 the tribunal decided that since investment activities were conducted from

In Amto,
premises in Latvia and the claimants had a small permanent staff, they met the test of
having “substantial business activities” there.*°° The company also had a bank account

in Latvia and paid taxes.*°7

In the present case, the claimed “substantial business activities” of the Claimants are
more substantial than those in PacRim, where there was no board of directors and no
bank accounts in the United States. The Claimants in this case would also meet the
requirements set out in PacRim for a “traditional holding company” in that it had “a
board of directors, board minutes, a continuous physical presence and a_ bank

account.”>°8

The facts of Amto bear some similarity to the present case, but there are differences. The
principal difference is that the NextEra Claimants have no permanent employees; they
contract with Intertrust, which conducts Claimants’ business in the Netherlands.
However, this does not seem an important distinction. Whether one operates a business
through permanent employees or contracts that work out to someone else is simply a
business decision about how to operate. In either case, substantive work is being done
for the company. The question is whether that work constitutes substantial business
activities. In this regard, the Tribunal does not give any weight to the fact that the

Spanish version of the treaty refers to “important” rather than “substantial” business
activities. Since it is the quality and not just the quantity of the activities that is relevant,
whether the term “important” or the term “substantial” is used does not make a

difference.

Amto provides a useful test, in that it looked to see if “investment activities” were being

conducted by the Latvian claimant. Applying that approach to the present case involves

356 CL-143, Amio, | 68.

357 In Guaracachi, the tribunal concluded that substantial business activities had not been established although it did
not set out any criteria for reaching that decision. The claimant had argued that the company had offices in the US,
held shareholder’s meetings and Board of Directors meetings there, and prepared minutes of those meetings. RL-

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 110 of 265

asking whether Claimants were engaged in investment activities from the Netherlands.
In this regard, the meetings of the Board of Directors in the Netherlands are significant.
In their Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, Claimants argue that in fact “significant”
business decisions relating to their investments were taken by Claimants, including
purchasing equipment for the Termosol Plants in 2008, equity injections of EUR 209
million, appointing auditors in the Netherlands, hiring counsel for these arbitration
proceedings, and hiring liquidators to oversee the liquidation of NEE Espajia in 2013.°*°
They also refer to reviewing operation summaries of the Termosol Plants, and reviewing

proposed debt restructuring.

In short, Claimants’ argument is that they are not shell companies in the Netherlands;
through their Board of Directors they play an active role in making decisions for their

investments and have been engaged in reviewing the activities of their investments.

The Tribunal notes that although there has not been a significant jurisprudence on the
question of “substantial business activities,” the tribunals that have found such activities
to exist have been prepared to do so on the basis of a relatively small number of activities
both in terms of quantity and quality. And that is true of the claim to having substantial
business activities in the Netherlands in the present case. As pointed out earlier, the
investment activities in respect of the Spanish investment are those of the U.S. parent and

Claimants have a very limited role.

However, in view of the decision that the Tribunal reaches in respect of denial of benefits
below, it does not have to decide whether Claimants’ business activities in the
Netherlands were substantial. Even if they were not substantial, Respondent still failed to

exercise its right to deny benefits in accordance with Article 17(1) of the ECT.

c. Assuming that Respondent Had the Right to Deny Benefits Did It
Exercise that Right in a Timely Fashion?

Article 17 of the ECT provides no guidance on the time at which the right to deny

benefits must be exercised and the cases seem to be divided on this.

264.

265.

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 111 of 265

In the present case, the denial was asserted by Spain on 9 September 2015 in its
Memorial on Jurisdiction.*© The question is whether that is too late. Although there has
been some controversy over when the right to deny benefits must be exercised, recent
cases have suggested that the right must be exercised no later than the time the benefits
are claimed (Ulysseas and Guaracachi). On that basis, by denying benefits in its
Memorial on Jurisdiction, Respondent was responding to the attempt by Claimants to

exercise ECT rights in bringing this claim.

However, the filing of the claim was not the first time that Respondent was aware of a
potential ECT claim by NextEra. As set out above, NextEra had engaged with the
Spanish authorities on its plan to invest in the solar industry as early as July 2009, both in
person and through correspondence. It was clear to the government that it was dealing
with an American corporation, but it was also made clear that this investment was

operated through a Dutch company.*°!

The details of Claimants’ ownership were
available in public registers and Respondent must be taken to be aware of the status of
Claimants. The contacts between the NextEra Energy group and the Spanish government
both written and in person were extensive, up to and including the prime ministerial level.
Encouragement and reassurances were provided to NextEra without any suggestion that
Spain would invoke Article 17(1) of the ECT and deny the benefits of the treaty to

Claimants.

More specifically, in a letter dated 15 March 2012 from John W. Ketchum, Vice
President, NextEra Energy Resources LLC to the Minister for Industry, Energy and
Tourism and the Secretary of State for Energy, the Spanish authorities were advised that
the Dutch company which owned the NextEra investment in Spain was the “beneficiary
of the protective provisions set forth in the Energy Charter Treaty” and that NextEra

would defend their rights including through international arbitration.*

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 112 of 265

Thus, by 15 March 2012, Respondent was aware that the NextEra Spanish investment
was owned by a Dutch company, which regarded itself as having rights under the ECT,
and that NextEra was willing to enforce those rights through international arbitration.
The Spanish government gave no indication that it would deny those rights. Indeed,
following this letter, the Spanish government made further assurances to NextEra and

Claimants went ahead and completed the building of the Termosol Plants.*°

In light of this, can Respondent then deny the benefits of Part IIT of the ECT once a claim

has formally been made? In Khan the tribunal said:

“A good faith interpretation does not permit a tribunal to choose a
construction of Article 17 to allow host states to lure investors by
ostensibly extending to them the protections of the ECT, to then deny them
these protections when the investor attempts to invoke them in
international arbitration.”>**

In the view of the Tribunal, once Spain became aware not just that it had a right to deny
benefits but that Claimants were relying on Spain’s statements and actions and were
reserving a right to invoke the provisions of the ECT, it was put on notice of a potential
exercise of ECT rights by NextEra. To delay until its Memorial on Jurisdiction on 9
September 2015, more than three years later, to exercise its right to deny benefits under
Article 17(1) of the ECT is hardly a good faith exercise of its right as contemplated by
the Khan tribunal. During that period Spain gave assurances about the protection the
NextEra investment would receive in full knowledge that it was an investment that, in
Claimants’ view, was proceeding under and with the protections of the ECT. As a result,
Claimants were justified in proceeding on the assumption that Spain would not exercise

its right to deny benefits under Article 17 of the ECT.

Respondent was confronted on 15 March 2012 with a clear assertion that NextEra’s
international Dutch investment company had rights under the ECT and that NextEra
planned to exercise such rights. Faced with such an assertion, and knowing that it had the

right to deny the benefits that Claimants were asserting, Respondent could not stay silent,

but it did. Its conduct can only be viewed as acquiescence in Claimants’ assertion of
ECT rights precluding Respondent from later seeking to assert a right to deny benefits

when it filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction on 9 September 2015.

In light of this, the Tribunal concludes that even if Claimants did not have “substantial
business activities” in the Netherlands, Respondent failed to exercise its right to deny

benefits under Article 17(1) in a timely fashion.

Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the second preliminary objection.

Spain objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction arguing that Claimants are not protected
investors under the ECT, because the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in Article 26
of the ECT does not apply to controversies arising between an investor of a EU Member
State and a EU Member State (“intra-EU”).°°

As both the Netherlands and Spain were EU Member States at the time they entered into
the ECT, and the EU is a Contracting Party to the ECT, Respondent contends, Claimants
are not investors of “another Contracting Party” as required by Article 26 of the ECT.*
The requirement of diversity in the Contracting Party “inevitably implies” the exclusion

of intra-EU disputes.°°”

Spain has observed, however, that it does not contend that the ECT contains “an express

99368

or implied disconnection clause. Relying on the EC’s opinion, Respondent argues

2&6

that the introduction of such clause was “entirely without relevance” “given that the

carried out.>°

(i) The Principle of Primacy of EU Law

In support of this objection, Respondent contends that:

. Being both EU Member States at the time of their ratification of the ECT, Spain
and the Netherlands could not deviate from their obligations in the EU internal
market.3”°

. The EU system already grants EU citizens an “integral” system of “specific and
preferential protection” for their investments, which applies over the ECT;
prohibits dispute resolution mechanisms different from those established in the EU
Treaties that could interfere with the internal EU market;*7' and offers the
appropriate legal resources for the protection of investors’ rights before national
courts.”

. Given this “integral” system of protection, within the EU, there is no distinction
between investors of a EU Member State and those of another Member State, and
therefore the category of foreign investor exclusively refers to investors from non-
EU Member States.*”°

e EU Law-— which is also applicable international law — prevails over the ECT in the
event of conflict.>4

Respondent emphasizes that underlying this objection is the essential principle of
primacy of EU Law in intra-EU relations, pursuant to which EU Law must be applied
over any other national or international law,>” regardless of whether EU Law is more

favourable or not.>”° It follows for Spain that “it is the [law] of the EU and not the ECT

which must be applied to resolve this dispute.”

277. For Spain, the preferential application of the EU system between EU Member States is

recognized by the ECT’s text, context and purpose.*”*
278. With respect to the text of the ECT, Respondent points out:

. First, that Article 1(2) of the ECT includes Regional Economic Integration
Organizations (“REIO”), such as the EU, within the definition of a “Contracting
Party,” and the definition of REIO in Article 1(3) recognizes that certain
competences have been conferred to the EU by its Member States irrevocably and
with binding nature, including on certain matters governed by the ECT.*”
Moreover, the definition of “Contracting Party” in Article 1(2) recognizes that
ECT Contracting Parties need to have agreed to be bound to one another, which
neither Spain or the Netherlands could do, because they no longer had the
competence to do so.38?

e Second, that Article 36(7) of the ECT reaffirms the conclusions above, in
providing that EU Members States and the EU cannot vote simultaneously.**!
This means, Respondent says, that the EU and each of its Member States can only
vote in the areas within the scope of their competences, and it is for the CJEU —
not for the Tribunal — to determine who is the competent Contracting Party in each
subject matter.***

. Third, that the regulation of the relation between the ECT and other agreements
(including the EU Treaties) in Article 16 of the ECT recognizes that, in intra-7EU
relations, the EU Treaties prevail over the ECT.383

. Fourth, that pursuant to Article 25 of the ECT, the EU integral system of
promotion and protection of investments cannot be applied to other ECT
Contracting Parties that are not EU Member States via the Most Favored Nation
(“MEN”) clause,*** which is an “explicit recognition” of the principle of primacy
of EU Law in intra-EU relations.***

. Fifth, that Article 26(1) of the ECT allows submission to arbitration of disputes
only between a “Contracting Party” and “an Investor of another Contracting

Party; and cannot give rise to obligations among EU Member States, because at
the time the ECT was entered into, EU Member States had already given over their
sovereignty in connection with the internal market to the EU and could not assume
inter-se obligations concerning that market.*®° As the consent in Article 26 of the
ECT is limited to disputes arising out of alleged breaches of obligations of Part III,
and EU Member States could not contract obligations among themselves under
Part III, Article 26 cannot apply to intra-EU disputes.**” Further, in addition to
arbitration, Article 26 provides for conciliation and recourse to national courts,
without establishing an order of preference or indicating that arbitration is more
favourable.*88

. Finally, that Article 26(6) provides that the Tribunal shall decide the issues in
dispute “in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of
international law,” thereby recognizing that EU Law must be applied “on an equal
level [...] as applicable international law.”**° Accordingly, any conflict between
the ECT and EU Law must be resolved pursuant to Article 25 of the ECT, which
recognizes both the primacy of EU Law in intra-EU relations, and that the process
of economic integration of the EU is more advanced than the ECT and therefore
more favorable.>”

Respondent dismisses Claimants’ interpretation of the above-mentioned provisions,

arguing that it is “literal and completely out of context.”*?!

Instead, Respondent urges
that an effective interpretation of the ECT leads to the conclusion that the ECT

recognizes the primacy of EU Law in intra-EU relations and excludes arbitration.*””

According to Respondent, the ECT’s object and purpose also support its position. That
is, Spain says, because admitting the intra-EU application of the ECT would dispense
with the ECT’s object and purpose, as (i) it would mean that the EU and its Member
States promoted the ECT to cover an area (intra-EU investments) already covered by EU
Law in an exhaustive and superior manner; (ii) it would take away competences from the

CJEU; and (iii) it would reflect a lack of trust in the EU system.*?

(ii) Intra-EU Arbitration Contravenes EU Law

281. It is Spain’s position that Article 26(6) of the ECT prevents intra-EU disputes, because
that would contravene EU Law, which is applicable international law.*°* Article 344 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”) prohibits the submission
of questions relating to the internal electricity market to arbitration, and in this arbitration
the Tribunal is being called upon to decide on the rights of a EU investor in the internal
market.*’> That is, Spain argues, because “the EU Directives in the area of renewable
energies are the framework of [the] Spanish legislation in which the Claimants allegedly
rely on making an investment” and as such “the question must be resolved in light of the

99396

interpretation of the EU law. Moreover, for Spain, the dispute affects essential

elements and pillars of EU Law, namely, the notions of State Aid, competition law, free
movement of capital and freedom of establishment, and as such the Tribunal does not

have jurisdiction to resolve it, as this power is reserved to the EU’s judicial system.°°”

282. For Respondent, it is significant that the objection is backed by the EC — “one of the most
authorised voices on interpreting the ECT’ and an ECT negotiator; and by legal
doctrine.°* ~~ The EC has recognized the “incompatibility of the Investment Treaties
signed between EU Member States and EU Law,” and of the arbitration provisions in the
ECT and EU Law, when applied to intra-EU disputes.°”?

283. Spain also draws significant support for this objection from the CJEU judgment in

Achmea, of 6 March 2018.4°° Spain contends that pursuant to this judgment “an

arbitration clause in an International Agreement concluded between EU Member States
(intra-EU BIT) is incompatible with EU law and, in particular, the autonomy of the EU

legal order.”*°!

Respondent first highlights that the Achmea judgment endorses the principles that: (i) the
judicial system established in the EU Treaties is intended to ensure consistency and
uniformity in the interpretation of the EU Law; (ii) pursuant to Article 19 of the TFEU, it
falls on national courts and tribunals and on the CJEU to ensure the application of EU
Law in the EU Member States; (iii) the preliminary ruling system established in Article
267 of the TFEU is intended to ensure uniformity in the interpretation of EU Law; (iv)
EU Law is both part of the law of each EU Member State and also derives from an

international agreement.*°

Spain then explains that the CJEU has concluded that the above principles are not
fulfilled through the establishment of an investment tribunal because: (i) the tribunal
might be called to interpret or apply EU Law, without being part of the EU judicial
system; (ii) not being a court or tribunal of a EU Member State within the meaning of
Article 267 of the TFEU, such tribunal cannot refer a matter to the CJEU; (iii) the
tribunal’s decision is final and judicial review limited by national law; (iv) investment
arbitration involves disputes that may concern the application or interpretation of EU
Law, but that system does not allow disputes to be resolved in a way that ensures the full

effectiveness of EU Law.*°

For Spain, the above-mentioned conclusions also apply in the context of the ECT. In that
regard, Respondent observes that Achmea refers to an “international agreement,” which
the ECT is, and not exclusively to bilateral investment treaties.*** Spain further contends

that the Achmea judgment’s reasoning is fully applicable here because: (i) under Article

 

(citing “Preliminary Ruling C-284/16 (Achmea Case) on the Compatibility Between the BIT Signed in 1991 by the
Netherlands and Slovakia (EC-13)” and “Case T-624/15 relating to the Application for Annulment of the European

26(6) of the ECT tribunals are required to interpret and apply EU Law to decide all the
issues in dispute, “not only as International Law, but also as internal law and as a
fact; (ii) EU Law applies to this dispute because the controversy affects a key
institution of EU Law: State Aid;4°° (iii) an ICSID tribunal “does not form part of the
judicial system of EU Law” and therefore cannot request a preliminary ruling from the
CJEU under Article 267 TFEU,*”’ and (iv) there is no certainty that in enforcement
proceedings the CJEU would have full knowledge and control over the EU Law applied
by the tribunal. *°*

(iii) The Decisions Relied Upon by Claimants are Not Dispositive or
Persuasive

287. Finally, Respondent dismisses Claimants’ reliance on prior decisions of other arbitral
tribunals, arguing that aside from those in cases against Spain, those decisions are not
dispositive of the matters at issue in this case because they: (i) “refer to Bilateral
Investment Treaties which have nothing to do with a multilateral and mixed treaty

promoted and signed by the EU;” or (ii) refer to States that were not EU Member States

288. In any event, Respondent takes the view that the application of the principles set forth in

the cases relied upon by Claimants, in particular those referring to intra-EU BITs and the

1,413

decision in Electrabe supports the conclusion that EU Law must be applied.*!*

289. In this context, Spain has argued that:

. A comparison of the object and purpose of the ECT and the EU Treaties leads to
the conclusion that the latter prevail, by virtue of Articles 30 and 59 of the
VCLT.*!5 For Respondent, especially after the 2007 Treaty of Lisbon, which
“expressly gathers competence in favour of the EU over foreign investment,” it is
unquestionable that EU Law prevails over the ECT in application of the lex
posteriori principle in Article 59 of the VCLT.*"°

. It is “impossible” to sustain that the rights afforded to investors under Article 10(1)
of the ECT are “different or superior” or “in addition” to those granted to them
under EU Law.*!”

. The contention that the ECT offers investors an additional right not afforded by
EU Law, namely, arbitration of investment disputes, overlooks that Article 26 of
the ECT also refers to national courts as a suitable dispute resolution mechanism
and assumes without evidence that arbitration is superior. The argument,
Respondent says, reflects a complete lack of confidence in the EU judicial system
incompatible with EU Law.*!®

. While the tribunal in Electrabel did not find any inconsistency between the ECT
and EU Law, such inconsistency does exist if Article 26 of the ECT is extended to
intra-EU disputes. This is more serious in the ICSID context, Spain argues,
because an ICSID award is not subject to appeal, which prevents the CJEU from
weighing in on matters that are within its strict powers.*!”

(i) The Text of the ECT Contradicts the Objection

For Claimants, the ordinary meaning of Article 26 of the ECT unambiguously
demonstrates that Spain consented to arbitration of disputes with investors of all other
Contracting Parties, including EU Member States.” By its express terms, Claimants
say, Article 26 permits arbitration of claims of an Investor of one Contracting Party (the

Netherlands), against another Contracting Party (Spain).?!

The plain wording of the ECT contradicts the contention that the EU and its Member
States are a single Contracting Party for purposes of Article 26 of the ECT.*?? The ECT
is a “mixed agreement” that was entered into by the EU and its Member States, and it is
binding on both; and when EU Member States become parties to a mixed agreement they
enter into relations inter se.*?> The competence of EU Member States to enter into the
ECT was expressly recognized by the EU in 1997.44 Moreover, under EU Law,
citizenship of the EU is not intended to replace national citizenship;*?> Claimants are

Dutch nationals under Dutch Law;*7°

and Claimants plainly meet the definition of
“Investor” in Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT, which is deliberately different from the

definition of REIO in Article 1(3).4?7

Each of the Netherlands and Spain is a distinct Contracting Party occupying its own area
for purposes of the ECT; each is a State that executed and ratified the ECT in its own
name and right; each is a separate subject of international law different from the EU; and

each would continue to be an ECT Contracting Party even if it left the EU.*7

The definition of “Area” in the Article 1 of the ECT is clear, and it means for each Spain

and the Netherlands “the territory under its sovereignty, it being understood that territory

includes land, internal waters and the territorial sea;” and it is undisputed that the plants
and measures at issue in this case are located or took place in Spain.*”? As the decisions

in PV Investors and Charanne held:

“The phrase ‘in the Areas of the former [Contracting Party]’ in Article
26(1) of the ECT refers to a particular dispute initiated by the investor. If
the investor commences arbitration against a member state of the EU
(rather than against the EU itself) then ‘Area’ means ‘with respect to a
state that is a Contracting Party’ the territory of that particular member
state, in accordance with the first sentence of Article 1(10). In other
words, the relevant area is that of the Contracting Party that is party to
the dispute.”*°

295. Therefore, Claimants argue, there is no question that the Netherlands or Spain can be
conflated with the EU for Article 26(1) of the ECT purposes.**! To the contrary, the
ordinary meaning of Article 26 of the ECT leads clearly and unambiguously to the

opposite conclusion.**”

296. As to Respondent’s attempt to rely on other provisions of the ECT to support this

objection, Claimants argue that:

. The contentions based on the definitions of REIO Article 1(3) and of “Area” in
Article 1(10) are a “detour.”*? Claimants submit that (i) recognizing the “Area”
of the EU as a REIO does not negate the existence of the “Areas” of each of the
EU Member States;*™ (ii) Article 1(3) does not define the extent of the EU’s
competence;*> (iii) Article 1(3) in fact affirms the primacy of the ECT, as it
recognizes that matters under the treaty “are governed by” the ECT;**° (iv) “the
natural and most straightforward interpretation of Arts. 1(2), 1(3) and 1(10) of the
ECT, which gives them full effet utile, is that a claim under Art. 26 of the ECT can
be brought against a REIO such as the EU or the applicable Member State,

depending on the circumstances,” and it is in fact Spain’s position that would
render nugatory the text of Article 26(1).4°7

. Article 16 of the ECT is a conflict of laws provision that “has nothing to do with
the effectiveness of the right to arbitrate under Art. 26 of the ECT,*** and it is
unnecessary to reach Article 16 because there is no conflict between the ECT and
EU Law?

. Article 25 of the ECT is a routine provision in investment treaties only intended to
prevent the extension to non-EU Member States of the benefits of EU membership,
and it does not concern intra-EU disputes.“

. The voting provisions established in Article 36(7) of the ECT pursuant to which
each the EU and the Member States vote in accordance with their competences, are
simply a reflection of the fact that the ECT is a mixed agreement, and have nothing
to do with the effects of the ECT between EU Member States.“*! For Claimants,
Article 36(7) “does no more, and no less, than regulate the Contracting Parties’
voting rights under the ECT’ and it “says nothing about the allocation of
competences between the EC (now the EU) and its Member States.”*?

(ii) The ECT Does Not Have a Disconnection Clause

In Claimants’ view, there is no basis in the text of the ECT to contend that it does not
apply intra-EU, because that would have required a reservation or an unequivocal
disconnection clause.** But the ECT contains no disconnection clause of the type Spain

1,44

seeks to imply into i and nothing suggests that this was inadvertent.*#> The ordinary

wording of the ECT should thus put an end to this argument.*4°

That said, Claimants add, the EU treaty practice, the ECT drafting history and unanimous
holdings of prior ECT tribunals also contradict the theory of an implied disconnection

clause.*? Claimants point out that: (i) the EU had used disconnection clauses in over 20

existence of an implicit disconnection clause.**!

Claimants contend that the EC Written Submission in this case provides no answer on

these points,*?

and argued in the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction that neither the EC, nor Spain
had been able to produce any contemporaneous evidence or a subsequent agreement

showing that the intent of the ECT was to exclude intra-EU disputes.

As to Spain’s assertion that its argument is not that the ECT contains a disconnection
clause, because such clause was superfluous, Claimants observe that the issue remains the
same whether the question is the existence of a disconnection clause, or the lack of
necessity of one: had the ECT Contracting Parties sought to carve out intra-EU disputes

from Article 26, they would have included express language, and they did not.**+

Responding to the contention that a disconnection clause is only needed where the
application of EU Law between EU Member States affects third parties’ rights or
obligations, or where derogation from a provision would be incompatible with the object

and purpose of the treaty, Claimants submit that “derogating to such an enormous extent

from Parts Ill and V of the ECT would be incompatible with the ECT’s object and

purpose of promoting long-term cooperation in the energy field.”*°°

Claimants finally point out that none of the ECT Contracting Parties entered any
reservation, and in fact Article 46 of the ECT excludes reservations to the ECT.*°° As
held in PV Investors, the consent by EU Member States expressed in Article 26 of the
ECT is “unconditional” and subject only to two exceptions contained in Article 26(3),

which are irrelevant for the issue at hand.*>7

(iii) Neither the Context of the ECT nor Supplementary Means of
Interpretation Support the Objection

According to Claimants, the EC Written Submission invites the Tribunal to disregard the

text of the ECT on the basis of the alleged treaty “context;” but such context cannot

8

displace the treaty text and, in any event, it does not support the objection.*** In

particular, referring to the principles in Article 31(3) of the VCLT, Claimants observed in

the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction that:

. There is no subsequent agreement between the ECT Contracting Parties, or
subsequent practice in the application of the ECT supporting the EC’s
interpretation.*°°

. While Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT provides that in treaty interpretation “[t]here
shall be taken into account, together with the context: [...] relevant rules of
international law applicable in relations between the parties,” (i) the word “rules”
suggests a certain degree of specificity not met by reliance on the “Union legal
order” and “multilateral agreements to which both the Union and its Member
States are a party under Union Law; (ii) the rules must be “relevant,” i.e. must
relate to the same subject matter of the treaty under interpretation, and also
applicable in the relations between all the treaty parties;‘*! (iii) the rules “must
always be considered within the context of the terms of the treaty under
interpretation,“ (iv) since Claimants are seeking to benefit from Article 26 of

the ECT (Part V) and to invoke the substantive protections of Part III, which they
consider more favourable to them than EU Law, pursuant to Article 16 of the ECT
“nothing in EU Law ‘shall be construed to derogate from’ these provisions of the
ECT.
For Claimants, the arguments advanced by Respondent and the EC on the basis of the
object and purpose of the ECT, and the circumstances of its conclusion are also

unconvincing.“

Relying on Article 32(a) of the VCLT, Claimants first contention is that because the text
of the ECT is clear, and it does not lead to manifestly absurd or unreasonable results,
there is no room to resort to supplementary means of interpretation “including the

preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion.’*>

As to the object and purpose, while Claimants acknowledge that Article 31(1) of the
VCLT provides that the ECT must be interpreted “in the light of its object and purpose,”
they argue that (i) such object and purpose must rest on more than speculation; and (ii)
the VCLT makes a choice in favor of an objective and textual interpretation over a
subjective one based on the intention of the parties.° Moreover, for Claimants, nothing
in Article 2 of the ECT (on the object and purpose of the treaty), suggests that the ECT
provisions are waived intra-EU.**’ In fact, Claimants argue, the application of the ECT
intra-EU facilitated the ECT’s object and purpose, as it offered companies investing in
Eastern Europe continuity of protection for investments in that region, as many of those

countries acceded to the EU later.*°*

Claimants also argued in the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction that there was no evidence
showing that EU Member States share the position that the ECT did not produce effects

intra-EU; a position that Spain adopted opportunistically in the face of numerous treaty

claims against it, and it never expressed between 1994-2014. And the arguments
based on the historical context of the ECT’s conclusion and those based on the
negotiating history of the WTO should not serve as supplementary means of

interpretation.*””

(iv) Article 26 of the ECT is Not Affected by the Transfer of Competences to

the EU
Claimants further oppose the contention that the provisions in Part III of the ECT and
Article 26 fall within the competence of the EU, such that when entering into the ECT the
EU Member States did not have competence to enter into inter-se obligations on the

matter of investment protection.47!

Article 25 of the ECT lends no support to the proposition that EU Law must prevail in
case of conflict between the ECT and EU Law.*” For Claimants, this article is not a
conflict rule giving primacy to EU Law over the ECT. It simply clarifies that the
preferential treatment that applies inter-se among EU Member States cannot be extended

to non-EU States via the MFN clause.*7?

Claimants equally consider “flatly irrelevant” the EC’s reference to the alleged principle
of international law of “Jiability follows competence.’*" This is a secondary rule of
international law, concerning attribution for purposes of determining an international
organization’s responsibility for wrongful acts, and has nothing to do with the creation or

extent of positive international obligations.*”°

Instead, Claimants argue that the relevant body to determine whether valid treaty
obligations were entered into is the VCLT, and rely on the finding in CSP that
jurisdiction “would not necessarily be affected by a finding that EU law barred the EU

and/or EU member states from entering into a treaty which provides for arbitration over

intra-EU investments.”*”°

(v) There is No Ground to Invalidate Spain’s Consent in Article 26 under
the VCLT
Claimants contend that Spain’s offer to arbitrate in Article 26 is valid and effective, and
reject the view that such offer is invalid because (i) it would violate EU Law which must
prevail over the ECT in the event of conflict, or (ii) it was modified or superseded
pursuant to Articles 41(1)(b) or Article 30(4)(a) of the VCLT.4””

Claimants explain that: (i) the sole grounds for invalidating a State’s consent to be bound
by a treaty are in the VCLT, and are not applicable in the present instance; (ii) even if EU
Law were relevant to determining the validity of Spain’s consent — which it is not - EU
Law does not prohibit arbitration of intra-EU investor State disputes; (iii) arguments
about the alleged primacy of EU Law substantive provisions over the ECT are irrelevant
for the jurisdictional analysis, and implausible in light of Article 16 of the ECT; (iv)
Articles 41(1)(b), 30(4)(a) or 59 of the VCLT do not apply here.*”8

Recalling that under Article 42(1) of the VCLT the validity of a treaty or the consent to
be bound by it can only be impeached by application of the VCLT, Claimants conduct an
analysis under Articles 46 and 45 of the VCLT.4” Claimants contend that EU Law
forms part of Spain’s domestic law, and therefore, in application of Article 46 of the
VCLT “Spain may not invoke, in support of its plea of invalidity, the fact that its consent
to be bound by a treaty was expressed in violation of a provision of EU law unless that

violation was manifest and concerned a rule of EU law of fundamental importance.”**°

As the ECT was negotiated and concluded by the EU and its Member States, it is

implausible to argue that Spain was not competent under EU Law to conclude the treaty;

and in any event, the alleged lack of competence would not be manifest, as shown by the
lack of evidence to that effect contemporaneous with the negotiation and conclusion of
the ECT.48! Moreover, even if there was any ground under Article 46, it would have
been waived under Article 45(b) of the VCLT because Spain never questioned the
validity of its consent in Article 26 of the ECT until the recent arbitrations, and has not

event sought to terminate intra-EU BITs.**?

Contrary to Spain’s contentions, Claimants further argue that “nothing in EU law
prohibits EU Member States from consenting to arbitrate disputes with EU investors
under an investment treaty,” and that is so “even where those cases involve questions of

EU law.”**

Noting that Spain’s argument rests on Article 344 of the TFEU, Claimants point out that
prior arbitral tribunals have already concluded that “Article 344 TFEU, [...] applies only
to disputes involving two or more EU member states but does not prohibit the submission
of disputes between other actors to a different method of settlement not contemplated in
the EU treaties;’*** “[t]he scope of Article 344 TFEU cannot be so broad as to prevent
Member States from submitting any dispute concerning the interpretation of EU treaties
to a dispute settlement procedure different from those provided in EU legislation;”** “it
cannot be reasonably maintained that Article 344 TFEU sets up an ‘interpretative
monopoly’ in favour of the CJEU;’** there is no inconsistency between the ECT and EU
Law, and the exclusive jurisdiction of the CJEU does not prevent other courts or tribunals

7

from applying EU Law.*8? These conclusions were not altered by the jurisprudence of

the CJEU;4** nor can the EC’s own self-serving declaration in the context of the

International Energy Charter Treaty in May 2015 provide any evidentiary support to this

objection, as it was issued 20 years after the ECT’s conclusion.**°

Moreover, Claimants point out that Spain and the EC accept that national courts and
arbitral commercial tribunals apply EU Law without violating Article 344 of the TFEU,

and there is no reason to treat investment treaty arbitration differently.*°°

According to Claimants, all the arguments based on the alleged primacy of EU Law over
the substantive protections of the ECT are, at best, relevant to the analysis of the merits,

but have no bearing on jurisdiction.*?!

In any event, they are misplaced because there is
no conflict in this regard between the ECT and EU Law, and should there be one, the
ECT would prevail.4°? The conflict of law rule in Article 351 of the TFEU (former
Article 307 of the TEC) does not give priority to EU Law over the ECT, because the ECT
is the later in time treaty: Article 351 only concerns rights and obligations in agreements
concluded prior to 1 January 1958 or for acceding States, prior to their accession to the
EU, and the ECT was concluded in 1994 and in force in 1998 after Spain acceded to the
EU in 1986.4” Instead, should the Tribunal find a conflict, it should resolve it by straight
application of Article 16 of the ECT.*%*

Lastly, Claimants assert that “the ECT, and in particular its Art{icle] 26, has been neither
modified nor superseded by the provisions of later EU Treaties under either of Art{icles]
41 or 30 of the VCLT; nor did the Treaty of Lisbon lead to the termination of the ECT
pursuant to Article] 59 of the VCLT.”*> Claimants explain that:

Article 41(1)(b) of the VCLT refers to amendment of a treaty by a later treaty, and
it does not apply here as none of the Treaties of Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon are
agreements to modify the ECT between EU Member States.*°° In any case, since
Spain did not rely on this provision the Tribunal does not need to address it.7”

Article 30(4)(a) of the VCLT only applies to “successive treaties relating to the
same subject-matter,” which the EU Treaties and Article 26 of the ECT are not,
since the EU Treaties are silent on investor-State arbitration.*?> Further, the
principle in Article 30(3) of the VCLT, pursuant to which the later in time rule
applies in the event of incompatibility, requires (i) that there is a true
incompatibility between the ECT and the EU Treaties, and (ii) that the provisions
of the EU Treaties deemed incompatible are in fact the latter in time, as opposed to
pre-existing provisions when the ECT was concluded in 1998; and neither has
been demonstrated.*”

Even if the ECT and the EU Treaties related to the same subject matter and were
mutually incompatible, guad non, Article 16 of the ECT is lex specialis that should
be applied. Accordingly, in the event of conflict between Part III or Part V of the
ECT and an earlier or later treaty between ECT Contracting Parties, the ECT
prevails to the extent more favorable to investors.°°° Thus the ECT prevails over
any “incompatible” provision in the EU Treaties.

Article 59 of the VCLT (concerning termination of a treaty implied by conclusion
of another treaty) does not apply, because (i) it only concerns a situation where “all
the parties” to the treaty allegedly terminated conclude a later treaty, and not all
the ECT Contracting Parties concluded the Treaty of Lisbon; (ii) the ECT and the
EU Treaties do not relate to the same subject matter, and are not “so far
incompatible” or “not capable of being applied at the same time;” and (iii) there is
no evidence that all the ECT Contracting Parties intended the matter to be
governed by the Treaty of Lisbon.*"!

(vi) The Objection Has Been Rejected by Prior Tribunals and Legal
Doctrine,*” and the Achmea Judgment Does Not Apply

against Spain, and in cases involving intra-EU BITs. Claimants also rely on a

number of commentators supporting the view that the ECT does apply between EU
Member States.>°° Lastly, Claimants observe that, despite its position in this case, the EC
has not been uniform in opposing the jurisdiction of tribunals hearing intra-EU

disputes.°°”

322. As to the Achmea judgment of 6 March 2018 relied upon by Spain,*°* Claimants contend
that: (i) it concerns a different treaty, a bilateral investment treaty concluded prior to the

accession of one of the States to the EU and not the ECT which is a multilateral treaty to

509

which the EU is a Contracting Party,” and (ii) it concerns different applicable law — the

host State law and other agreements between the State parties to the BIT were part of the
governing law according to the underlying BIT, and the ICSID Convention did not
apply.*"° These distinctions, Claimants say, have an important bearing on the analysis

under the ECT, for various reasons:>!!

e As the ECT was concluded by the EU and the EU Member States, it was a
conscious decision by them to assume binding treaty obligations, it does not
undermine the EU Law principle of mutual trust, and it is binding on them as a
matter of international law and EU Law.>!?

. The Achmea judgment does not apply to treaties to which the EU is a Contracting
Party, such as the EcT.*!3

. The CJEU interpreted that the BIT at issue in Achmea required the application of
the EU Treaties, because the governing law clause included “any other relevant
Agreements between the Contracting Parties” and the host-State law. By contrast,
Article 26(6) of the ECT expressly requires the Tribunal to resolve the dispute
according to international law and the ECT; and it does not require the Tribunal to
interpret the EU Treaties or EU Law.°'* In addition, the claims in this case
concern violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT, not whether Spain violated EU Law
provisions;>'> and the legal character of the claims is not altered even if incidental
points of EU Law might arise.>!®

. Both Spain and the Netherlands were part of the EU when they entered into the
ECT. The two provisions of the EU Treaties which form the basis of the Achmea
judgment (Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU) had their origin in the 1957 Treaty
of Rome, and were already binding on Spain and the Netherlands when they
entered into the ECT. Neither is new, nor do they amount to a treaty subsequent to
the ECT. While the Lisbon Treaty changed the title of the EU Treaty to the TFEU
and amended some aspects of it, that does not make it /ex posteriori to the ECT.>!”
Thus, when entering into the ECT: the EU and its Member States did not consider
themselves in contravention of now Article 344 of the TFEU; in the event of
inconsistency, according to Article 16(2) of the ECT, the ECT prevails over the
EU Treaties; and since Article 344 of the TFEU is not a new treaty conflicting with
an earlier treaty, the ECT is the lex posteriori.*'®

323. But, Claimants argue, even if Spain had demonstrated an inconsistency between EU Law
and the ECT in light of the Achmea judgment, the ECT would prevail.*!? The alleged
principle of primacy of EU Law is an internal EU Law principle reflecting supremacy of
EU Law over the law of the EU Member States, and it does not alter the hierarchy of the
ECT over EU Law established by virtue of Article 16(2) of the ECT and customary
international law.*?° If the Tribunal concludes that the ECT and the TFEU cover the

same subject matter, Article 16(2) of the ECT must be applied; if the Tribunal concludes

that they do not cover the same subject matter, there is no conflict and no predicate to
apply Article 30 or 59 of the VCLT.!

Finally, “[t]he CJEU itself recognised the EU law is not to be treated as international
law, but instead as a body of law which is ‘autonomous’ and ‘independent’ of both
international law and the national law of each Member State, and binding domestically
in (and not just on) each Member State — in contrast to the plane occupied by
international law.”>?? And it is a basic principle of international law recognized in
Articles 7 and 32 of the International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility
(“ILC Articles on State Responsibility”) that “a State cannot invoke its own breach of
its domestic law as an excuse for violating its international obligations,” and in Article
46 of the VCLT, which “prevents a State from pleading domestic law requirements to

honour its international treaty commitments.”>?>

(2) The Non-Disputing Party’s Written Submission

a. Spain’s Offer to Arbitrate in the ECT Does Not Cover Investors from EU
Member States

The EC takes the view that the ECT does not create inter se obligations and does not
apply in the relationship between EU Member States that were EU Members when the
ECT was ratified.*4 This, it says, follows from the text of the ECT, the nature of

multilateral agreements, and the object and purpose of the ECT:

. The Text. Articles 1(2), 1(3) and 36(7) of the ECT recognize that the EU Members
transferred competences to the EU on matters governed by the ECT.*”> Similarly,
the definition of “Area” in Article 1(10), contains an express reference to the
provisions of the EU Treaties, and recognizes that the relationships of the
Members to a REIO are governed by the agreements establishing that REIO.
Further, the definition of “Area” of the EU comprises all the Areas of the EU
Member States, such that intra-EU there is no diversity of Area.’ A different

interpretation deprives Article 1(3) and 1(10) of effet utile, and encourages
“respondent shopping,” prohibited by ECT.*?”

The Nature of Multilateral Agreements. A multilateral agreement to which both
the EU and its Member States are a party is EU Law, and the CJEU is in general
competent to interpret it, except if the provision is exclusively within the
competence of the EU Member State.*’* In negotiating these agreements, the EU
and its Member States are bound by the principle of unity of EU Law,°”° and in the
case of the ECT they acted like a single block.*”

The Object and Purpose. The historical process that led to the ECT makes clear
that its objective was to create an international framework for cooperation in the
energy sector between the EU, and Russia, the CIS and Central and Eastern
Europe. Also, when created, the ECT was perceived as a part of the EU external
energy policy and was never intended to influence the internal energy policy.>*!
The object and purpose of the ECT reflect that all the ECT Contracting Parties
understood that the EU Member States did not intend to create inter se obligations
in areas for which they retained competence.***

Disconnection clauses were used in international treaties where the EU would not
become a Contracting Party, to serve as a “reminder” of its existence. But that is
completely different in international treaties where EU is a party, and is explicitly
recognized in its role as REIO, such as the ECT. There, all Contracting Parties
were fully aware of the specificities of the EU legal order.**? Further, Claimants’
argument on the disconnection clause relies on academic articles unsupported by
the sources that they cite.*4

But even if the ECT had created intra-EU obligations, which the EC denies, such
obligations would not comprise the provisions on investment protection in Part III of the
ECT or the dispute settlement provision in Article 26, because EU Member States had
transferred to the EU competence on those subjects.>*> Pursuant to Article 64 of the ILC
Articles on Responsibility of International Organizations and case law, the principal law

applicable for determining the extent of the international obligations and international

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 136 of 265

liability of EU Member States is “liability follows competence.”**° For the EC,
“protection and promotion of investments in other Member States, as well as energy, fall
into the external competence of the Union.”°*" Further, an inter-se investment protection
treaty between EU Member States “might affect common rules or alter their scope,” that
is, the EU system of investment protection.*** As such, pursuant to Article 3(2) of the
TFEU, EU Member States did not have the external competence to conclude such type of

treaty.>°°

EU Member States are presumed to be aware of the rules governing distribution of
competences; and the ECT recognizes that the EU Member States had transferred
competences to the EU on matters covered by ECT. Accordingly, all the ECT
Contracting Parties were aware of the existence of the distribution of liability“? As a
result, the ECT provisions on investment promotion and protection bind the EU, but not

the EU Member States inter-se.*4!

Should the Tribunal consider that the ECT is ambiguous with respect to the question of
intra-EU obligations, the EC argues, it should favour an interpretation that does not
conflict with EU Law, namely, that the ECT does not apply between EU Member States

at all, or at least that Part III and Article 26 do not apply between them.*4?

b. Spain’s Offer to Arbitrate Is Not Valid

According to the EC, even if Spain had made an offer to arbitrate to intra-EU Investors,
that offer would not be valid because: (i) it would violate EU Law, which prevails over

the ECT in the event of conflict pursuant to Article 351 of the TFEU;*# and (ii) that offer

would have been modified or superseded pursuant to Articles 41(1)(b) or 30(4)(a) of the
vcLT.4

According to the EC: (i) the intra-EU application of the substantive protections of the
ECT would violate Article 3(2) of the TFEU, because EU Law provides a complete set of
tules on investment protection, and the EU Member States did not have competence on
those matters;>4°

violates Articles 19(1) of the TEU and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU, and the general

and (ii) treaty-based investor-State arbitration of intra-EU disputes

principles of effectiveness and unity of EU Law. *“° Pursuant to those provisions, the EC
argues, disputes concerning the application of the EU Treaties are to be resolved before
the CJEU — for disputes involving two Member States, or the national courts — for
disputes between a private party and EU Member State.*4”7 Thus, when EU Member
States create a separate body for dispute resolution that is required to apply EU Law, such
as Article 26 of the ECT does, they violate Article 344 of the TFEU.™® Further, for the
EC, the decisions by investment tribunals holding that Article 344 only applies to
disputes between EU Member States overlook that national courts are part of the EU
legal order and can therefore apply EU Law, and miss distinctions between commercial

arbitration and investment arbitration.”

The EC goes on to add that, having identified a conflict with EU Law, the applicable
conflict rule would be Article 351 of the TFEU, pursuant to which the ECT provisions
incompatible with EU Law (i.e. Part III and Article 26) would become inapplicable.*°

But even if the matter were to be analyzed under the general rules of conflict in the

of the VCLT.**! The EC argues in particular:

GB)

Article 41(1)(b) of the VCLT on the amendment of a treaty by a later treaty would
operate here because the Treaties of Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon “re-affirmed”
the EU rules on investment protection, competences and the system of judicial
protection.**? And the conditions of Article 41(1)(b) of the VCLT are met because
(i) suppressing inter se obligations between EU Member States only concerns EU
Member States; and (ii) suppressing the provision at issue (investor-State
arbitration in Article 26) would not be incompatible with the object and purpose of
the ECT as a whole.>*

If no amendment took place, Article 30 of the VCLT would operate as the rule to
resolve a conflict between an earlier treaty and a later treaty relating to the same
subject matter; pursuant to which the earlier treaty applies only if compatible with
the later treaty.* The ECT and the EU Treaties relate to the same subject
matter.*°> And given that in the Treaties of Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon, EU
Member States “re-affirmed” their commitment to EU Law, then the ECT
(concluded in 1994) is the earlier treaty.*°° As the provisions of the ECT on
investment protection (Part III and Article 26) are incompatible with EU Law if
applied intra-EU, they are not applicable pursuant to Article 30(4)(a) of the
VCLT.9°7

The Tribunal’s Analysis

As a preliminary remark, the Tribunal thanks the European Commission for its assistance

in the current proceedings on the matter of jurisdiction regarding intra-EU investments

operations.

that the EC decision on that matter was pending at the time. Arguing that the matter was relevant to the merits, it
invited the tribunal to stay the proceeding until the EC made its ruling. EC Written Submission, §] 11, 149-150.

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 139 of 265

The Tribunal wishes to approach the issue taking into account earlier cases where
tribunals have upheld jurisdiction under Article 26 of the ECT,*** as well as the Achmea
judgment rendered by the CJEU,>°? which marked a turning point in the on-going debate
surrounding the compatibility of intra-EU investment agreements with EU Law, since it
found investor-State arbitration clauses in intra-EU BITs to be incompatible with EU

Law.

Despite the notable difference that in Achmea, the CJEU was asked to determine the
lawfulness of an intra-EU bilateral investment treaty, the Tribunal is mindful that the
Achmea judgment is also discussed in the context of the investor-State arbitration

mechanism established under the ECT.*

Respondent has objected to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis that the dispute
resolution mechanism set forth in Article 26 of the ECT does not apply to controversies
arising between an investor of the EU and another EU Member State. These objections
are in line with the observations expressed by the European Commission in its EC
Written Submission, which takes the view that the ECT does not create inter se
obligations among EU Members States and that a correct application of the principles of

supremacy and autonomy of EU Law render Spain’s offer to arbitrate invalid.

From the outset, the Tribunal wishes to recall that consent to jurisdiction in international
adjudication must be established. In this respect, the Tribunal does not believe that the
jurisdiction of a tribunal is bounded by the way in which a claimant may decide to frame
its claims. It is not because an investor has solely based its claim on the ECT that the

Tribunal will retain its jurisdiction. The principle of compétence de la compétence

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 140 of 265

requires an arbitral tribunal to establish the extent and limits of its jurisdiction

objectively, on the basis of the title of jurisdiction that is conferred to the said tribunal.

In this case, a correct exercise of the principle of compétence de la compétence, requires
the Tribunal to look into the terms of the ECT, and in particular into the terms of Article

26 setting up the dispute resolution mechanisms.

In light of the objections put forward by Respondent, the Tribunal finds it pertinent to
address the issue of jurisdiction through the following questions: the first question is
whether the ECT applies to relations inter se of EU Member States and whether the ECT
Contracting Parties intended to carve out and exclude jurisdiction over intra-EU disputes
(a); the second question is whether the subsequent overlap that may exist between the
ECT and EU Law regarding investment operations rendered Spain’s offer to arbitrate
invalid (b).
a. Whether the ECT Excludes Inter Se Obligations Among EU Member
States?

Respondent contends that the present Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear intra-EU disputes
because Article 26(1) of the ECT implies that the Parties must be of different nationalities
and that in the present case, the diversity requirement fails since both Parties are from the
European Union. Thus, Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction because

Claimants are not from “another Contracting Party” as required by Article 26.

In particular, Respondent relies on Article 1(3) of the ECT defining a REIO as “an
organization constituted by states to which they have transferred competence over
certain matters a number of which are governed by this Treaty, including the authority to
take decisions binding on them in respect of those matters,” as well as Article 1(10)
defining the term “Area” of a REIO as “the Areas of the member states of such
Organization, under the provisions contained in the agreement establishing that

Organization.”*°!

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 141 of 265

It is true that the very dynamic nature and rapid evolution of EU Law may complicate the
interpretation of treaties such as the ECT, and that a harmonious interpretation remains
the most effective tool to avoid a conflict among the two sets of norms. But, for the
purpose of establishing jurisdiction, the Tribunal remains bounded by the explicit terms
of the relevant Treaty (i.e. the ECT), with due regard to its object and purpose in
accordance with the VCLT.

The Tribunal cannot infer from the terms of Articles 1(3) and (10) of the ECT that the
Contracting Parties intended to exclude intra-EU investment operations from the
jurisdiction of investment tribunals. The fact that the EU is a Contracting Party to the
ECT did not deprive the EU Member States of their competence to enter into obligations
under the ECT at the time of its conclusion. Therefore, in absence of a disconnection
clause and a revision of the ECT by the Contracting Parties, the Tribunal cannot conclude
that presence of the EU as REIO consenting to the provisions of the ECT would
supersede the consent given by each EU Member State individually to the ECT. Rather,
a good faith interpretation of the terms of the ECT leads to the conclusion that a REIO,
such as the EU, may have standing under the ECT in arbitration proceedings. However,
concluding that Contracting Parties, taken individually, lack standing when the
investment operation remains in the European Area would go beyond the terms of the

Treaty.

As explained by the tribunal in Blusun “[t]he inter se obligations in the ECT are not
somehow invalid or inapplicable because of an allocation of competence that the EC says
can be inferred from a set of EU laws and regulations dealing with investment. The more
likely explanation, consistent with the text of the ECT, is that, at the time the ECT was

signed, the competence was a shared one.”>

The fact that it ultimately became
transferred to the EU cannot be used by this Tribunal as an argument to establish or
decline its jurisdiction alone. The ECT operates among Member States since it was not
concluded as an agreement between the EU and its Members States but as an ordinary

multilateral agreement.

Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants satisfy the literal requirement as set
forth in Article 1(7)(a)(ii) to be an investor of a “Contracting Party,” and the terms of the
ECT do not suggest that the Contracting Parties intended to exclude inter se obligations
or that an EU investor is precluded from bringing a claim against an EU Contracting
Party. A follow up question is whether the overlap existing between the ECT and the EU

Law has rendered Spain’s offer to arbitrate under the ECT invalid.

b. Whether the Subsequent Overlap Between the ECT and EU Law
Rendered Spain’s Offer to Arbitrate Invalid?

Respondent and the EC argued that Article 26(6) of the ECT directs the Tribunal to apply
both international and EU Law and that, in the event of conflict, Article 344 of the TFEU
and EU Law should prevail. Moreover, it was argued that Article 26 of the ECT has been
superseded by the provisions of later EU treaties under either Articles 41 or 30 of the

VCLT.

Article 344 of the TFEU provides that “Member States undertake not to submit a dispute

concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement

other than those provided for therein.”*°

Article 26 of the ECT entitled Settlement of disputes between an Investor and a

Contracting Party states in its relevant parts:

“(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the
former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former
under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably. (2) If such disputes
cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a
period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute
requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may
choose to submit it for resolution: [...] (6) A tribunal established under
paragraph 4 shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this
Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.”>°*

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 143 of 265

Respondent and the EC have found Article 26 of the ECT to be in contradiction with
Article 344 of the TFEU. It was argued that in Achmea, the CJEU confirmed this
approach when it concluded that “Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as
precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States,
such as Article 8 of the BIT [between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and
Slovak Federative Republic] [...].”°° According to the CJEU, Article 267 TFEU has
been breached because an arbitral tribunal is not a court which belongs to one of the court
systems of the Member States, which means that the Member States have given the

competence to interpret EU Law to a court other than the CJEU.

The present Tribunal is not empowered to decide whether a dispute submitted by a
European investor against a European State under the ECT falls under Article 344 or is in
breach of Article 267 of the TFEU. The task of this Tribunal is to determine whether
such dispute falls under the provisions of the ECT. Likewise, it is not the task of this
Tribunal to determine whether the scope of this dispute concerns the application of the
TFEU, but rather whether such dispute concerns the application of the substantive

provisions of the ECT.

If the Tribunal were to follow the approach of the EC and Respondent and treat the
present dispute as an “internal dispute,” it would mean that EU Law is applicable for the
purpose of jurisdiction. However, the ECT and — in particular Article 26 — is the
instrument governing the present Tribunal’s jurisdiction as well as Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention. Therefore, through the dispute settlement mechanism of the ECT
“this Tribunal is placed in a public international law context and not a national or
regional context.”*° The intra-EU nature of the parties does not by itself make the

present dispute into a purely European one.

Although the Tribunal understands that in the present case, EU Law may find application,
it cannot state that overlap between the two sets of rules strips the present dispute of its

international aspects. In other words, the Tribunal cannot infer its own competence — or

incompetence — from the principle of primacy of EU Law over the ECT for intra-EU
disputes. The fact that there may exist a partial overlap between the two set of rules on
the merits (such as FET and Fundamental Freedoms), cannot, for the purpose of
jurisdiction, be resolved in favour of EU Law. This is because the questions pertaining to

the Tribunal jurisdiction must be answered in light of Article 26 of the ECT.

Respondent and the EC have further argued that intra-EU obligations were superseded in
application of Articles 41(1)(b) of the VCLT on the amendment of a treaty by a later
treaty, and, that if the Tribunal were to consider that no amendment took place, Article
30(4)(a) of the VCLT on “application of successive treaties relating to the same subject
matter” would operate as a rule to resolve a conflict between the two treaties. The
Tribunal considers that the rule relating to “treaties relating to the same subject matter”
is not applicable to the present situation where treaties negotiated by a smaller number of
States, i.e., the EU founding Treaties, are claimed to modify a treaty such as the ECT.
These treaties do not “relate to the same subject matter” in the sense of Article 30.°°
Moreover, the Tribunal has had no evidence placed before it that would demonstrate that
the subsequent EU Treaties were amending the ECT for the purpose of Article 41(1)(b)
of the VCLT.

The Tribunal notes in this regard that the CJEU in its Achmea judgment did not rely on
the aforementioned articles of the VCLT to resolve the alleged conflict between the intra-

EU BIT and EU Laws.

The Tribunal notes that the internal constitutional laws of the EU and its constant changes
and interpretations by the CJEU, as the Member States seek to minimize their mutual

obligations in another context, are of no relevance for the present Tribunal.

In the Tribunal’s view, “the ECT’s genesis generates a presumption that no contradiction
exists between the ECT and EU law,”>® and as a consequence, the Tribunal cannot

retroactively construe Spain’s offer to arbitrate under the ECT as invalid.

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 145 of 265

Respondent — not the EC — further argued that primacy of EU Law is reflected in Article
25 of the ECT entitled “Economic Integration Agreements,” which states “[t]he
provisions of this Treaty shall not be so construed as to oblige a Contracting Party which
is party to an Economic Integration Agreement (hereinafter referred to as ‘EIA’) to
extend, by means of most favoured nation treatment, to another Contracting Party which
is not a party to that EIA, any preferential treatment applicable between the parties to
that EIA as a result of their being parties thereto. For the Tribunal, Article 25
specifies that the treatment that may apply inter-se among EU Member States cannot be
extended to non-EU Member States via the MFN clause. This does not imply that
investors from Member States of the European Union are deprived of their procedural

rights as recognized by Article 26 of the ECT.

For the above-mentioned reasons, the Tribunal is not in a position to conclude that
Spain’s consent to submit ECT disputes to arbitration excluded intra-EU investment
disputes and that primacy of EU Law excludes jurisdiction of the present Tribunal

established under the ECT. Therefore, this Third Objection to jurisdiction is dismissed.

measures enacted in Law 15/2012, namely, the TVPEE and the amendment to the Tax on

Spain contends that it has not consented to arbitration of this claim, given that Article 26
of the ECT only concerns claims for violation of Part III of the Treaty, and pursuant to
Article 21 of the ECT, Article 10(1) (although located in Part III) does not give rise to

obligations in connection with tax measures.*””

Respondent explains that “if no
obligation derived from [P]art III of the ECT exists, there can be no alleged breach of it,
and, thus, there is no consent of the Contracting Party to resort to arbitration and the

Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the issue.”>”

Spain explains that Article 21 of the ECT contains a general exclusion of taxation
measures from the scope of the ECT (the “taxation carve-out”), with a few exceptions
specifically listed in the same Article.°’ None of those exceptions, Respondent says,

refers to Article 10(1) of the ECT.*”>

The TVPEE is a “Taxation Measure” within the meaning of Article 21(7)(a) of the ECT,
according to which the term includes: “(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic
law of the Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority

therein; [...].’>7°

Spain notes that Law 15/2012 is a law passed by the Spanish
Parliament and is thus part of its domestic law, and argues that the provisions concerning

the TVPEE are “relating to taxes.”>"

In Spain’s view, the law governing the determination of whether a provision is relating to
taxes is the domestic law of the Contracting Party to the ECT.** This is supported by (i)
the wording of Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT, and (ii) the Netherlands-Spain double
taxation treaty, which must be taken into account pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the

VCLT.5” That said, Respondent argues that, even if the Tribunal concluded that

international law governs this question due to Article 26(6) of the ECT, the conclusion

will be the same: the TVPEE is a tax.**?

Under domestic law, Spain maintains, there can be no doubt that the TVPEE is a tax, as
ratified by the Constitutional Court itself.**! It follows clearly from the text of Article 1
of Law 15/2012 that the TVPEE is a “direct tax on the performance of the activities of
production and incorporation into the electrical system of electrical energy in the
Spanish electrical system.”°*? This is confirmed by Article 2 of Law 58/2003 on General
Taxation.*** The TVPEE is a tax of general application that covers both renewable and
ordinary generation facilities; its tax base is the total amount received for the production
of electrical energy and its introduction into the grid in the taxable period; the rate is 7%;
the taxable period is generally the calendar year; and the tax is accrued on the last day of

the period.*** It is also deductible from corporate tax.**°

There can also be no doubt that the TVPEE is a tax from the perspective of international
law, Spain argues.°*° It fits within the concept of tax developed by arbitral decisions
because: it is established by law, and it imposes an obligation on a class of people to pay
money to the State for public purposes.**’ In addition, the EC has confirmed both that it

is a tax, and that it conforms with EU Law.>*8

Respondent takes the view that the above is sufficient to conclude that the TVPEE is a

of the measure.** In any event, Respondent contends that the TVPEE is a bona fide

taxation measure, arguing that:5”°

. Contrary to Claimants’ contentions, the TVPEE is not discriminatory: it is of
general application to both renewable and conventional producers, and grants the
same treatment to both.*?!

. There is no discrimination between conventional and renewable producers in terms
of “repercussion,” that is, the possibility to transfer the amount of the tax by the
payer to another person.**? Being a direct tax, there is no “legal repercussion” in
connection with the TVPEE.%? There is also no discrimination from the
perspective of “economic repercussion,” because the costs of this tax on renewable
energy producers are remunerated to them under the applicable regulatory regime,
so its effect on them is neutralized.°**

. The TVPEE’s objective is to raise revenue for the State for public purposes. It is
an income integrated into the State’s general budget, and it is allocated to finance
the costs of the electricity system.*** It does not seek to carry out a disguised tariff
cut, as shown by the fact that its effects on renewable energy producers is
neutralized.°”°

366. Respondent also points out that various tribunals have already upheld objections to
jurisdiction over claims arising out of violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT resulting from

the TVPEE, finding that the TVPEE is a “Taxation Measure” for purposes of the ECT.*°”

excludes the consent in Article 26 improperly seeks to read into the later provision a

specific exclusion to the ECT’s dispute settlement mechanism, which is not there.°”

Claimants acknowledge that Article 21 of the ECT “does not directly include ‘Taxation
Measures”” within the scope of Article 10(1) of the ECT, but argue that the TVPEE can
be one of the Disputed Measures in this case because: (i) it is an ad valorem charge on
gross revenue, and the functional equivalent a tariff cut as acknowledged by the
Government, not a tax on “income or capital” within the meaning of Article 21(3) of the
ECT; and (ii) even if the TVPEE were considered to be a tax, because it is not a tax on
income or on capital, pursuant to Article 21(3) of the ECT it can be assessed under
Article 10(7) of the ECT — the MFN Clause -, which applies to “Taxation Measures.”!
According to Claimants, the tribunals that have addressed the issue of jurisdiction over

the claims arising out of the TVPEE have not considered these same arguments.”

Although in their pleadings Claimants answered the Fourth and Fifth Objections together

as a whole,?

the present Section addresses the objection pertaining to claims for breach
of Article 10(1) of the ECT. Claimants’ arguments pertaining to Article 10(7) of the ECT

are further summarized in Section E(1)b infra.

To support the argument that the TVPEE is just an “ad valorem levy” and not a “tax on
income or capital,” Claimants point out that: (i) in October 2012, the Ministry of Industry
acknowledged that Spain could have achieved the same result as the TVPEE through a
direct tariff cut; (ii) Law 15/2012 does not even describe itself as deriving its validity
from the Government’s taxation power in Article 66 of the Spanish Constitution, but
rather from Article 45 concerning environmental protection; and (iii) the ordinary

meaning of the term “taxes on income” refers to taxes on net income. On this basis,

Jor ECT purposes.

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 150 of 265

Claimants argue that it is “questionable whether the 7% levy is a Taxation Measure at all
29605

Claimants also emphasize that, in any event, if the Tribunal were to find that the TVPEE
is a tax caught by the exclusion in Article 21 of the ECT, this would have a minimal
impact on damages of around EUR $1.1 million on historical damages.®° They go on to
explain that, given that the TVPEE is an operating cost that renewable energy producers
can recover under Regulatory Framework III, the losses under Regulatory Framework III
do not result from the TVPEE. Thus, the TVPEE would only be relevant to a small
portion of Claimants’ historical losses, i.e. those between start of commercial operation
(29 May 2013 for Termosol 1, and 7 June 2012 for Termosol 2) and the date marking the
beginning of the retroactive application of Regulatory Framework III (9 July 2013).°°7
Further, Claimants argue, if the Tribunal does not adopt the primary “but for” analysis for
quantification of damages, but instead adopts the alternative damages case based on a
finding that only a “reasonable return” could be expected, damages would not need to be

adjusted on account of lack of jurisdiction over the TVPEE.°*

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

In the view of the Tribunal, the TVPEE is a “7axation Measure” within the meaning of
Article 21(7) of the ECT, and thus falls within the exclusion of taxation measures from
the application of the ECT under Article 21(1) of the ECT. The 7% levy imposed under
the TVPEE is, as Respondent points out, “established by law,” and it “imposes an
obligation on a class of people” to “pay{] money to the State for public purposes.”° It
does not matter that, as Claimants argue, the economic effect of the TVPEE is

functionally equivalent to a tariff cut.

Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that damages could not be awarded on the basis of

loss resulting from the imposition of the TVPEE. However, the Tribunal also points out

that, in light of its conclusions below regarding liability and damages, the impact of the
TVPEE is not relevant in the assessment of damages in any event. In short, as a result of

the Tribunal’s conclusion on liability, the Fourth Objection becomes moot.

FIFTH OBJECTION: LACK OF JURISDICTION OVER CLAIMS UNDER ARTICLE 10(7) OF
THE ECT ARISING OUT OF THE TVPEE

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Respondent’s Position

Respondent contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear Claimants’ claim that
Spain has breached Article 10(7) of the ECT through the imposition of the TVPEE.°'°
Spain argues that, although Article 10(7) of the ECT does apply to “Taxation Measures,”
pursuant to Article 21(3) of the ECT, Article 10(7) does not apply to taxes on income or
on capital.°!! Put another way, says Spain, Article 10(7) does not apply to direct taxes
(i.e. those “levying direct manifestations of the economic capacity” that “cannot be
legally passed-on” to another person), but only to indirect ones (i.e. those “levying
indirect manifestations of the economic capacity of tax payers, such as consumption” that

can “passed-on to another person”).°'

According to Respondent, the TVPEE is a direct tax, and specifically a tax on income: it
levies income obtained for the production and incorporation into the grid of electrical
energy. As such, Article 10(7) of the ECT does not apply to it.°!> It is irrelevant that the
TVPEE is a tax on gross income (as opposed to net), because the definition of tax on

income in Article 21(7)(b) of the ECT does not refer to net income.°!*

Because Spain’s consent to arbitration in Article 26 of the ECT refers to disputes arising

out of violations of Part III of the ECT, and there is no obligation under Article 10(7)

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 152 of 265

with respect to the TVPEE, there can be no breach thereof, and therefore, there is no

consent.°!5

377. But even if Article 10(7) of the ECT could cover the TVPEE, Spain argues, it could not
impose MEN obligations in the form intended by Claimants.°!® This is because pursuant
to Article 21(3)(a) of the ECT, Article 10(7) “shall not apply to: (a) impose most
favoured nation obligations with respect to advantages accorded by a Contracting Party
pursuant to the tax provisions of any convention, agreement or arrangement described in
subparagraph (7)(a)ii) or resulting from membership of any Regional Economic
Integration Organization; [...].” In turn, Article 21(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT refers to “any
convention for the avoidance of double taxation or of any other international agreement

or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound.” °"”

378. For Spain, the Uruguay-Spain BIT that Claimants attempt to import via the MFN clause
is an international agreement to which Spain is bound, within the meaning of Article
21(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT. To the extent its substantive provisions (including FET) are
applied to taxes, they are “provisions relating to taxes.”°'® In consequence, Article 10(7)

of the ECT cannot serve to import protections from the Uruguay-Spain BIT.°!?

b. Claimants’ Position

379. As noted earlier, in their pleadings Claimants answered the Fifth Objection together with
the Fourth.°° The present section summarizes the arguments pertaining to the
applicability of Article 10(7) of the ECT, and its consequences. To recall, as mentioned
in Section D(1)b supra, Claimants’ position is that, even if the TVPEE were considered a

tax, because it is not a tax on income or capital, it would fall to be assessed within the

scope of Article 10(7) of the ECT (the MFN Clause), which does apply to “Taxation
Measures” per Article 21(3) of the ECT.*!

By virtue of Article 10(7) of the ECT, Claimants say, Spain is prevented from applying
the TVPEE in a de facto discriminatory matter; and the TVPEE indeed discriminates
against renewable energy producers in favour of conventional energy producers.”
Pursuant to Article 10(7) of the ECT, Spain is also required to give Dutch investors the
same treatment that it gives to other foreign investors. Since in other investment treaties
Spain has agreed to provide Fair and Equitable Treatment (“FET”) in connection with
taxation, in particular, in the Spain-Uruguay BIT, then Claimants are entitled to the same

FET, even if the TVPEE is considered a tax.°°

Claimants dismiss Respondent’s allegation that the TVPEE is not covered by Article
10(7) of the ECT because it is a tax on income or capital. For Claimants, the view that
Article 10(7) only applies to indirect taxes is not supported by Article 21(3) or Article
21(7)(b) of the ECT, which draw no distinction.®* It is also clear that the TVPEE is not
a tax on income or capital, but rather on gross revenue for the production and

transmission of electricity.°7

Claimants also counter Respondent’s reliance on Articles 21(3)(a) and 21(7)(a)(ii) of the
ECT to support the conclusion that Article 10(7) of the ECT cannot impose MFN
obligations in relation to the TVPEE, thereby preventing importation of the Spain-
Uruguay BIT.®° Claimants explain that the purpose of Article 21(3)(a) of the ECT is to
limit the application of Article 10(7) by saying that “the advantages [...] pursuant to the
tax provisions of any convention, agreement or arrangement described in subparagraph
(7)(a)(ii) or resulting from membership of any Regional Economic Integration
Organization” do not extend to the other ECT Contracting Parties via the MFN provision.
However, the Spain-Uruguay BIT neither contains “tax provisions,” nor it is a

“convention, agreement or arrangement’ of the types referred to in Article 21(7)(a)(ii)

when defining “Taxation Measure.”°"

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal is of the view that Article 21(3) of the ECT, which excludes taxation on
capital and income from taxation measures otherwise covered under Article 10(7) of the
ECT, prevents a claim on the basis of the TVPEE from being pursued under Article 10(7)
of the ECT. The TVPEE is a tax on revenue derived from the supply of electricity into
the Spanish grid. It is, therefore a tax on gross income. There is no basis for assuming
that the reference to income in Article 21(3) of the ECT was a reference to net income.

Thus, there is no basis for Claimants to pursue a claim under Article 10(7) of the ECT.

However, as pointed out in respect of the Fourth Objection, in light of the Tribunal’s
conclusions below on regarding liability and damages, the impact of the TVPEE is not
relevant to the assessment of damages in any event. In short, as a result of the Tribunal’s

conclusion on liability the Fifth Objection becomes moot.

APPLICABLE LAW

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS
(dl) Claimants’ Position

Claimants contend that the applicable procedural law is composed of the procedural
provisions of the ECT and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.°* They argue, in turn, that the
applicable substantive law pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT consists of (i) the ECT
substantive provisions; (ii) the VCLT; and (iii) applicable rules and principles of
international law.°? Lastly, according to Claimants, Spanish law is relevant as a fact to

be taken into consideration in certain circumstances, but an ECT tribunal “can only

international law.”°°

Claimants have also emphasized that Spain cannot invoke its own domestic law to justify
breaches of international law.®' Claimants argue that “[dlomestic Spanish law principles
are not ‘applicable rules and principles of international law’ and this Tribunal is not

authorised to apply them as part of the applicable law.”

Claimants also submit (in the context of discussing the EC Decision of 10 November
2017 on State Aid) that the Tribunal is mandated to apply the ECT over EU Law in the

event of inconsistency.°

(2) Respondent’s Position

Respondent also espouses the view that the substantive law to be applied, pursuant to
Article 26(6) of the ECT consists of (i) the ECT substantive provisions; (ii) the VCLT;

and (iii) applicable rules and principles of international law.°™*

Spain further agrees that
Spanish law is relevant as a fact to be considered in certain circumstances, but it
emphasizes that “Spanish law is also decisive in shaping the legitimate expectations that

any investor may have at the time of investing in Spain.”®*

Spain also takes the view that “European Union law constitutes applicable international
law for the resolution of this dispute under Article 26(6) of the ECT.’°° On those bases
Respondent has argued that the EC Decision of 10 November 2017 on State Aid as part

this Tribunal’s decision must be compatible with that EC Decision.°*”

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

In the view of the Tribunal the applicable law is the ECT and any rules of international
law relevant to its interpretation and application. The Tribunal will refer to provisions of
Spanish law and EU Law if appropriate. Their particular weight and relevance will be
assessed in this decision in the context of the issues in respect of which they have been

raised.

LIABILITY

Claimants contend that Respondent has violated Articles 10(1) and Article 10(7) of the
ECT.™* They argue that “Spain’s enactment of Law 15/2012, RDL 2/2013, RDL 9/2013,
RD 413/2014, and the [Ministerial] Order [IET/1045/2014], coupled with the application
of those measures to the Termosol Plants and the PTEs, gives rise to a breach of Article
10(1) of the ECT through actions which violated the FET standard and breached

obligations assumed by Spain towards the Claimants’ investments.”

According to
Claimants, “Spain breached Article 10 ECT when it overhauled the remuneration regime
pursuant to which the Claimants invested and replaced it with Regulatory Framework
11° Spain has breached its obligations in three ways, according to Claimants: (i) by
repudiating Claimants’ legitimate expectations; (ii) by breaching its duty to provide a
stable, consistent and transparent framework; and (iii) by failing to adopt reasonable,

proportionate and non-discriminatory measures.**!

In turn, Respondent denies that it has breached Article 10(1) of the ECT,° or Article
10(7) of the ECT.“ Respondent argues that (i) it has not breached Claimants’ legitimate

measures are proportionate and non-discriminatory,”’’ were adopted for “justifiable

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS
(dl) The Standard in Article 10(1) of the ECT
a. Claimants’ Position

Claimants contend that the commitment to grant Fair and Equitable Treatment (“FET”)
in Article 10(1) of the ECT is an “autonomous treaty standard [...] independent of the
minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.”*” It is to be applied
“in light of the European Energy Charter’s commitment to legal stability and the
environmental protection goals explicitly identified in the ECT’s Preamble, Article 2 and
Article 19.°°°°

According to Claimants, Article 10(1) of the ECT imposes a number of distinct, but
related obligations.°'! The FET standard in Article 10(1) comprises requirements for the
host-State to: (i) protect “an investor's legitimate and reasonable expectations;” (ii)
“maintain reasonable stability in its legal framework,” (iii) “act in good faith;” (iv) “act

652

proportionately,” and (v) respect due process and avoid denial of justice; with facets

(i) and (ii) being especially relevant in this case.%* Article 10(1) also guarantees

transparency in actions by the State; and it precludes arbitrary, unfair, unjust,

idiosyncratic, and discriminatory conduct.%*+

395. Protection of Legitimate and Reasonable Expectations. Claimants contend that the
protection of legitimate and reasonable expectations is an integral part of the autonomous
FET standard,° and the revocation of a State’s assurances giving rise to those
expectations constitutes a breach of the standard.°° Relying on Plama, Claimants argue
that the legitimate expectations protected under Article 10(1) “include the conditions that

were specifically offered by the State to the Investor when making the Investment and that

657

were relied upon by the Investor to make its Investment. And referring to Suez,

Claimants add that investors are protected when they have “derived reasonable

expectations from the laws and regulations adopted by the host country, acted in reliance

upon those laws and regulations and changed their economic position as a result.”°*

They add, however, that the FET standard also protects against “changes in law affecting

a long-term capital intensive investment (even in the absence of the specific additional

assurances provided by Spain in this case).”°?

396. Stability, Consistency and Transparency of the Legal Framework. Claimants also argue

that FET includes legitimate expectations of a “stable and predictable investment

environment.”®© Article 10(1) of the ECT expressly requires States to “encourage and

create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors;

a point
also reflected in the European Energy Charter (basis for the ECT), and further confirmed

2

by the Energy Charter Conference. The importance of a stable legal and business

environment has been recognized by tribunals in their analyses of the FET standard.°

In Claimants’ view, Respondent unduly restricts the scope of Article 10(1) of the ECT by
arguing that it does not impose limits on a State’s regulatory power.®™ Claimants explain
that while they do not contend that “States should be precluded from enacting laws when

the circumstances change,” such regulatory authority is not limitless, and it is also “not

7665

impervious to scrutiny under international law. According to Claimants, “[b]y

entering into the ECT, Spain accepted a limitation on its powers to alter the

remuneration framework applicable to the Claimants’ investments.”

Claimants also oppose the view that the FET standard in Article 10(1) of the ECT is
limited to the Minimum Standard of Treatment under customary international law
(“MST”). In their view, conflating the FET standard with MST would ignore the rules of
treaty interpretation in Article 31 of the VCLT; it is not supported by the text of the ECT

or by supplementary means of interpretation.°”

The phrase “[i]n no case shall such
Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international
law, including treaty obligations” in Article 10(1) of the ECT does not alter the

conclusion because: (i) it appears much later, after the FET obligation located in the first

Article 10(1) uses different words to articulate the FET obligation and MST, thereby
showing that they have a different meaning.* The opposite interpretation would not

give effect to all the terms of Article 10(1).°”

Moreover, Claimants contend, the conclusion that the FET standard in Article 10(1) of
the ECT goes beyond MST is supported by decisions in ECT cases,*”! and also in BIT
cases referring to provisions with references to international law similar to that in Article

10(1) of the ECT.£72

Claimants also take issue with Respondent’s reliance on Article 2 of the 1991 European
Energy Charter, arguing that the fact that this provision sought to achieve non-
discrimination and market-oriented price formation does not give license to ignore the
text of Article 10(1). Both the ECT and the 1991 European Energy Charter indicate that
their purpose is to promote investment and economic cooperation,®”* and “[t]he
promotion of investment and economic cooperation [...] supposes positive obligations

that go beyond the [MST].”°"*

Claimants further deny that the FET standard in Article 10(1) of the ECT is limited to
national treatment.°”> This conclusion, Claimants argue, cannot be reconciled with (i) the
text of Article 10(1) which includes a separate prohibition against discrimination in a
stand-alone sentence; or (ii) the definition of “Treatment” in Article 10(3) of the ECT; or

provisions would have been unnecessary; and equating them renders the provisions

meaningless.°”

Lastly, Claimants take issue with what they describe as Spain’s effort to “second-guess
whether or not the granting of special privileges for foreign investors is warranted.”°”
In Claimants’ view, whatever policy debates might exist, “Spain made the policy decision
to accord a right of FET to qualifying energy sector investors in its territory, on the basis
that Spanish investors would benefit from the same rights in the Netherlands and in all
other ECT Contracting States,’ which was “not a one-sided policy choice” but rather

“one based on reciprocity;” freely made and not open to the Tribunal to second-guess.°””

b. Respondent’s Position

Respondent contends that the aim and purpose of the ECT is to grant foreign investors
national or non-discriminatory treatment.®*° Spain denies that the ECT affords higher
protection than MST, or that it offers protection directly related to the support of

renewable energy investments.**!

According to Spain, the ECT’s investment protection system is aimed at achieving an
energy open market in Europe based on the principle of non-discrimination.? Thus, the
ECT’s principal investment protection objective is to afford “domestic treatment” or

83 This objective,

“non-discrimination” once an investment has already been made.
Spain argues, is not breached by the adoption of measures that are (i) proportionate; (ii)

justified by public interest; and (iii) applied erga ommes to both foreign and domestic

investors.°** Subsidies that distort competition in the energy market (such as those

Claimants’ seek) are incompatible with the ECT.

Further, in Spain’s view, the obligation in Article 10(1) of the ECT to afford treatment
“Tijn no case [...] less favourable than that required by international law, including
treaty obligations” refers to MST under customary international law, with “domestic
treatment” or “national treatment” being the maximum protection granted to foreign
investments when more favourable.®*° Put another way, as the objective of the ECT is to
achieve non-discrimination, “[o]nly when the absence of discrimination does not
guarantee the investors treatment in accordance with the minimum standards of

International law do these standards go into effect to ensure their protection.”°*"

Respondent goes on to argue that the protection afforded by Article 10(1) of the ECT
varies depending on the stage at which the investment is at. The “commitment to accord
at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable
treatment” applies during the “making [of the] investment,” because this particular
sentence of Article 10(1) refers to the preceding one dealing with “conditions [...] to
make Investments in its Area.”®8 But, once an investment has been made, Article 10(1)
offers protection “against discriminatory and irrational measures that affect the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, and disposal of the investment,” setting as a
minimum that “[i]n no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable
than that required by international law, including treaty obligations.”®° Further,
national treatment protection contains an exception in the field of State aid, as shown in

Article 10(8) of the ECT.°”

Spain denies that its interpretation of Article 10(1) of the ECT renders Article 10(7)
meaningless, observing that Article 10(7) also includes an MFN guarantee, in addition to

national treatment.™!

According to Respondent the ECT does not guarantee sustainable energy development at
any cost, as it has to be both economic and environmental.©? Respondent argues that the
purpose of the ECT is stated in Article 2, and that Article 19 on environmental protection
is of minor importance. For Spain, while Article 19 provides that the ECT Contracting
Parties shall “have particular regard to Improving Energy Efficiency” and “to developing
and using renewable energy sources,” it does not mandate the granting of “petrified”
public subsidies, and the ECT respects the State’s regulatory power in the area of State

aid.6%

Spain also takes the view that, while the ECT requires the creation of stable and
transparent conditions for investment, it does not prevent the adoption of justified and
non-discriminatory macroeconomic control measures by a State.©> The ECT does not
require Contracting Parties to maintain a regulatory framework stable and predictable
throughout the whole investment, as Article 10(1) refers to stable “conditions” and not to
a stable “regulatory framework.”© Further, the ECT does not “cancel or limit to the
extreme” the State’s regulatory power, nor provide an insurance policy to investors
against regulatory changes.°” The only limit to the State regulatory power in the ECT is

MST, and an objective of non-discrimination.©8

In Respondent’s view, the context and subject matter of the ECT support its
interpretation. Because the ECT concerns investments in a highly regulated and strategic

sector such as the energy sector, Spain says, “[i]t is not very realistic” to interpret it as an

public interest.”©? The obligations in Article 10 of the ECT must be “tempered” by the
provisions in Part IV referring to sovereignty and the State’s economic regulatory power,

tax veto and attribution rules.’°°

Finally, Spain also argues that arbitral awards interpreting the FET standard in the ECT
support its position, in particular the notion that “in the absence of a specific commitment
to stability, an Investor cannot have an expectation that a regulatory framework such as

the one discussed in this arbitration will not be amended.”

(2) Article 10(1) of the ECT: Repudiation of Legitimate and Reasonable
Expectations

a. Claimants’ Position

Claimants contend that Respondent “actively induced [them] to invest by offering a long-
term and stable remuneration system, backed by repeated assurances from the most
senior Spanish government officials addressed _ specifically to  NextEra
representatives."

According to Claimants, they held legitimate expectations that the Termosol Plants would
benefit from the remuneration regime in RD 661/2007 “as stabilised in RDL 6/2009 and
RD 1614/2010” (“Regulatory Framework I’) for their entire useful life, and that they
relied on those expectations to invest in Spain.” For Claimants, Regulatory Framework
I “guaranteed specific tariffs and premiums, operating hours, and upper and lower

remuneration limits for the lifetime of their plants, and Claimants “moved their

legal certainty, Claimants say, they would have never invested.’°7

414. Respondent breached those expectations, Claimants argue, by “dismantling Regulatory
Framework I via Regulatory Framework II1,”7* which is (i) fundamentally different
from Regulatory Framework I; and (ii) yields a very different rate of return (from an

anticipated 11.6% post-tax to a 1.9% post-tax).!?

adjusted annually based on the Spanish Consumer Price Index less 0.5%.7!!

contemplated under RD 661/2007, i.e. insulated from changes beyond annual
adjustment for inflation; or put another way, that any future cuts would not apply
to existing plants accepted into the Pre-Assignment Registry in accordance with
RDL 6/2009 and RD 1614/2010.’

of 25 years, followed by a further period without any time limit for the remainder
of their useful life.”"”

(ii) Source of the Expectations

Those expectations were formed, Claimants say, from: (i) the terms of Regulatory
Framework I; (ii) the registration of the Termosol Plants in the Pre-Assignment Registry
of 11 December 2009 (iii) two Ministerial Resolutions of 28 December 2010; (iv)
“uniquely explicit and specific assurances of stability concerning the Termosol Plants”
by the highest levels of the Spanish Government to NextEra officials; and (v) the final
registration in the RAIPRE of 29 May and 7 June 2013.7!8 In addition, the capital-
intensive nature of a CSP-investment in which the Government alone can drive success

or failure also served as basis of Claimants’ expectations.”!?

Claimants argue that Spain’s laws up to 2012 provided “clear commitments to maintain
its production-based remuneration regime for the long term.””° These laws, Claimants

say, “did not envisage, or provide any warning of, the fundamental changes that Spain

418. More specifically, Claimants assert that “Regulatory Framework I expressly committed to
provide long-term certainty around the premiums and tariffs available to CSP plants that
had been admitted by Spain within its Pre-Assignment Registry,” and in particular, argue

that:73

. Article 36 of RD 661/2007 expressly defined the long-term tariffs and premiums
for an initial 25-year period and an indefinite period thereafter.

. Article 4(2) of RDL 6/2009 stated that plants accepted within the Pre-Assignment
Registry would receive “the right to the economic regime established by Royal
Decree 661/2007.”

. The Fifth Transitory Provision of RDL 6/2009 stabilized the economic regime
applicable to plants that had applied for pre-assignment registration by 6 June
2009.

. Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 “made clear that the four-yearly reviews contemplated
by Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 would not apply to any of the tariffs, premiums or
upper and lower limits granted to CSP plants that were approved within the Pre-
Assignment Registry and completed within the timeframes set out in the Agreement
of the Council of Ministers.””* Claimants reject Respondent’s interpretation of
Article 4 of RD 1610/2010, and deny that its sole purpose was to extend the
second paragraph of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 to plants commissioned in
2013.7 Such interpretation, Claimants say, is contradicted by the plain wording,
the Government’s own analysis of Article 4 and the drafting history of the
provision.’”°

plants.

419. Claimants argue that, contrary to Respondent’s allegations, the assurances in Regulatory
Framework I are sufficient to ground Claimants’ expectations.’ According to
Claimants, “[i]t is now well-established that the legal framework surrounding an

investment may contribute to the creation of legitimate expectations for investors.”7°8

420. In any event, Claimants argue, their expectations were “reinforced” by specific
assurances given by the Spanish Government that induced them to invest, and in
particular, to proceed with construction of the Termosol Plants in December 2010.’

According to Claimants, those assurances were provided in:

. Meetings held in the summer of 2009 with Spanish officials.’*”

. A 3 September 2009 letter from the Secretary of State for Energy.7*!

they had submitted their application for Pre-Assignment registration before a
certain date [6 June 2009] and went on to complete construction and obtain final

stabilization guarantee.

422. Spain’s commitments, Claimants argue, were also echoed as the Government’s policy

during “roadshows” by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade and

46

InvestInSpain.”° According to Claimants, Spain engaged in a “worldwide campaign

aimed at enticing international investors” conducted by InvestInSpain, including
presentations which describe the tariffs set in RD 661/2007 as “guaranteed” for the life
of the asset in an initial period of 25 years and an indefinite period thereafter.” In
addition, between 2007-2010, the CNE, “consistently represented to investors that Spain
was committed to providing regulatory stability, in the form of economic support
mechanisms that were [...] subject of a ‘warranty by law’, and that the revisions to tariffs

and premiums foreseen at four-year intervals in Art. 44 of RD 661/2007 would apply only

to new plants, not to existing ones.”™*

423. Claimants oppose Respondent’s analysis of these assurances arguing: first, that Spain
isolates them and omits some of them, contrary to “a well-settled principle [...] that the

existence of legitimate expectations must be assessed in the light of the ‘totality of the

99749

circumstances’ of a case; second, that the clear text of the letters and witness

evidence contradict Spain’s interpretation,’°° and third, that any allegation of ambiguity
in the assurances fails as a matter of law because “it is the host State, not the investor,

who bears the consequences of any ambiguity in its representations to foreign

investors.”?!

(iii) The Timeline of the Investment and Expectations

Claimants have argued that the timeline of their investments is marked by three phases:
(i) a first exploratory phase, “predicated on the tariffs, and premiums set in RD 661/2007
being available,” but with Claimants not going beyond the initial project outlay due to
flaws in RD 661/2007; (ii) a second phase in which Claimants increased their investment
“[pJursuant to further assurances including RDL 6/2009,” which came to a halt in April
2010 amid rumours of a cut in tariffs and premiums; and (iii) a third and final phase,
commencement of construction in December 2010, “marked by the conclusion of a

process which culminated in the passing of RD 1614/2010."

Claimants contend that when approached in early 2007 by Casas de Hitos to co-develop a
solar energy project, the project had an “initial interest” because at the time “Spain was
[...] actively encouraging foreign investments in renewable generation through long term

incentives [...]27°

Claimants say that, while they viewed these initial incentives as
insufficient, they did engage in discussions with this company and signed an initial set of
contracts in December 2007, which did not require the development of the Termosol
Plants, but were “a framework for doing so if the Spanish regulatory conditions

improved.”"*4

According to Claimants, prior to their decision to proceed with construction of the
Termosol Plants in December 2010, Spanish law had already started offering a
framework intended to provide regulatory certainty and to promote and develop
renewable energy, “based around a commitment to provide a clear, transparent regime
which ensured a reasonable profit for investors, through payments based on the amount
of electricity produced.””*> Such framework was formed by the 1997 Electricity Law,
RD 2818/1998, the 2000-2010 Renewable Energy Plan, RD 1432/2002, RD 436/2004,

the 2005-2010 Renewable Energy Plan, RDL 7/2006, and RD 661/2007.7°° Claimants
argue that, at the time of their initial development contracts in December 2007, the two

key legal instruments were the 1997 Electricity Law and RD 661/2007.7*”

Claimants contend that RD 661/2007 was deliberately intended to stimulate
investment,’>* “by prescribing specific long-term premiums and tariffs that it committed

to provide to developers within the Special Regime.’

Referring to Article 36,
Claimants argue that “Spain committed to deliver these tariffs and premiums throughout
a plant’s operational life, with no fixed time limit.’ In addition, Claimants argue that,
while Article 44(3) contemplated a review of the tariffs in 2010, it “assure[d] investors
that future cuts to the remuneration system would affect only new plants, not plants that
had been constructed within the first 5|00 MW of CSP capacity” if they had “started
operations within two years of the changes [...].” Claimants add, however, that this “did
not cure the uncertainty over whether or not any given plant would be among the first
500 MW of installed capacity [...].’"°' Claimants also highlight that RD 667/2007
provided that tariffs and premiums would be updated for inflation annually by reference
to the Consumer Price Index, less a reduction of 0.25% until 31 December 2012 and
0.5% after (Article 44 and Add. Provision 1); allowed the use of a support fuel to produce
electricity not exceeding 12% of the total annual production (regulated tariff option) and
15% (pool + premium option) (Article 2); and granted priority of access and dispatch

(Article 17 and Annex XI).”

According to Claimants, however, Spain’s assurances of a “reasonable return” were not

sufficient to attract them, and they “proceeded with their investment” only because Spain

went further in 2009 and 2010 offering a system which guaranteed an express and pre-
defined long-term tariff and premium, i.e. a “commitment to a specific revenue level.”
In other words, Claimants say that “[b]y itself [...] RD 661/2007 was not enough to entice
[them] to take their investment beyond the exploratory stage,” and “Spain had to provide
(and did subsequently provide) an express commitment to adhere to the tariffs and
premiums being offered thereunder for plants constructed in reliance on RD
661/2007.”"* Claimants argue nonetheless that “RD 661/2007 (as further stabilised
through laws enacted in 2009 and 2010) was a key factor in the [...] decision to invest in

Spain?

RDL 6/2009 led Claimants to “further increase[] their initial investments in Spain,”™®

they argue, because: (i) the Pre-Assignment Registry established therein provided
certainty, given that Article 4(2) established that pre-registered plants would receive “the
right to the economic regime established by Royal Decree 661/2007;”" (ii) it “expressly
stabilised the existing economic regime for qualifying plants whose applications for entry
in the Pre-Assignment Registry were filed within a defined deadline [6 June 2009],”
which the Termosol Plants did on 14 May 2009; 768 (iii) it reassured investors that, if the
targets for CSP electricity were oversubscribed, Spain would address that matter before
investors commenced construction not after;’? and (iv) through RDL 6/2009, Spain also
committed to gradually reduce its tariff deficit levels and eliminate any further increase in

the deficit by 2013.7”

Claimants add, however, that despite the assurances in RDL 6/2009, they required more
certainty to proceed with construction, because the decree “arguably left open a question

whether the four-yearly reviews under RD 661/2007 were indirectly imported into RDL

officials [gave] NextEra specific assurances that Spain [would] not change the regulatory
regime applicable to the Termosol Plants;’" (ii) the Spain Council of Ministers
provided further reassurances and support for the expansion of renewable energy in the
agreement dated 13 November 2009,’ which “reaffirmed Spain’s commitment to
providing the economic benefits promised under RD 661/2007 and RDL 6/2009, even
though uptake on the Special Regime under RDL 6/2009 greatly exceeded Spain’s initial
target of 500 MW of installed power for CSP facilities;’"* and (iii) between December

2009-February 2010 Spain accepted the Termosol Plants into the Pre-Assignment

Registry and provided further assurances of regulatory stability.’”°

Spain may cut the applicable tariffs and premiums,’”° and that the PTEs only commenced
construction in December 2010 after Spain provided further assurances of regulatory

stability.””” In this regard, Claimants refer to:

“reaffirmed Spain’s commitment that pre-assigned plants could proceed with

beyond normal consultations by the Spanish legislature;’*° but even if it was not an
agreement, it was in any event implemented in Spain’s law.’*!

RD 1614/2010 of 7 December 2010. According to Claimants, this decree was a
compromise that reduced the projected returns of the Claimants’ investment but
provided even greater assurances of regulatory certainty, negotiated both through
the 2 July 2010 Agreement and specific exchanges between Spain and Claimants’
representatives.’”*? In Claimants’ view, RD 1614/2010 “stabilize[d] the key
elements of the remuneration regime applicable to the Termosol Plants,”"® and in
particular, provided two safeguards upon which Claimants relied to commence
construction: (i) a promise that the feed-in-tariffs and premiums would not change
other than for inflation,” set forth in Article 4 which “established that any future
revision of tariffs, premiums, and the lower and upper limits set out in Article 44.3
of RD 661/2007 would not apply to plants registered with the Pre-Assignment
Registry in accordance with the 4th Transitory Provision of RDL 6/2009 (i.e.,
those that had submitted their applications for pre-assignment registration before
6 June 2009 and went on to complete construction and obtain final RAIPRE
registration within the relevant time limits);’7> and (ii) a promise set forth in
Article 2(3) that Spain would not further reduce the annual operating hours eligible
for remuneration under the Special Regime (capped through RD 1614/2010)
throughout the operational life of the plants which met the same conditions
identified above.”®° The Termosol Plants, Claimants argue, were given definitive
RAIPRE registration within the relevant deadlines.”

The Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade Resolutions of 28 December 2010.
According to Claimants, these “expressly confirmed that the Termosol Plants
would be subject to the remuneration system then in force,” and “amounted to
specific undertakings by Spain, addressed to the PTEs, confirming that Spain
would remunerate the Termosol Plants in accordance with RD 661/2007 and RDL

6/2009.”"88 Claimants reject Respondent’s contention that these resolutions only
informed of the remuneration applicable to the plants “at the present time” but did
not ensure that it would be constant throughout the Termosol Plants operating life,
and argue that Respondent’s position is contradicted by the text of the resolutions,
and the context in which they were issued.’*° Moreover, Claimants argue that
whether or not the Directorate that issued them had power to bind the Government
under domestic law is not material because “[i]nternational law recognises the
competence of State officials and agencies to bind their State by unilateral
statements without regard to any internal authorisation process under municipal
law.”7%°

Claimants go on to argue that Spain’s reassurances continued while construction was on-

going, referring to the 2011-2020 Renewable Energy Plan, which “confirmed the existing

legislative framework to promote the use of energy from renewable sources, including

RD 661/2007, RDL 6/2009 and RD 1614/2010.”"?'

Claimants lastly contend that the history of Claimants’ capital contributions to NEE
Espaiia illustrate the reliance placed on Spain’s assurances, as shown by a table of their

contributions starting in 2008 until December 2013.7”

According to Claimants, the
table shows “comparatively modest contributions in 2009, followed by increased
contributions in March 2010, one further contribution in July 2010 as Spain began to put
flesh on the proposals that became RD 1614/2010” with “the most significant

expenditures coming from April 2011 onwards [...].”7

In response to Respondent’s allegations, Claimants deny that there are any contradictions

in their case resulting from the above timeline. Thus, Claimants explain that:

the Ministry for express confirmation of the remuneration that the Termosol Plants would receive for their operating

life,

. “(Their initial decision to invest was predicated on the remuneration scheme
defined by RD 661/2007, but the Claimants only moved beyond the exploratory
phase once Spain had addressed the flaws inherent to RD 661/2007 by passing
RDL 6/2009."""*

. Their capital contributions to NEE Espaiia in March 2010 were approved at a time
when there was no inkling of the possibility that Spain would renege on its
commitments as the rumors began in April 2010, and the decisions to make those
contributions were all taken in December 2009 months before the rumors of
regulatory changes began to surface. In addition, the committal of equity did not
commit NEE Espajia to spending that money, unless and until there was sufficient
certainty from the Government.”>

Finally, referring to Spain’s allegation that 2011 is the proper year for measuring the

Claimants’ expectations, Claimants contend that Spain has therefore admitted that “20//

is the correct year” and that the analysis must include the commitments made in RD

1614/2010.’"° That said, during the Hearing, Claimants clarified that their position is that

the date of the investment is December 2010 (not April 2011).7”

(iv) Expectation of the Specific Revenues of RD 661/2007, Not of a Variable
“Reasonable Return”

Claimants deny that Regulatory Framework I only guaranteed a “reasonable return” for
their investments as a dynamic concept subject to change.’ Claimants’ view is that (i)
such concept is “irrelevant” because Spain did guarantee that the Termosol Plants would
receive the regime in Regulatory Framework I; and (ii) as a matter of Spanish law, the
concept of “reasonable return” was a directive to the regulator, superseded by the
specific tariffs and premiums set forth in RD 661/2007.7”

Claimants say that they would have never invested in Spain if Respondent had merely
committed to providing an amorphous “reasonable return” to the Termosol Plants. But
even if “reasonable return” had been the only guarantee, at the time of investment Spain

had effectively quantified such reasonable return at 7.6%-11% after-tax for CSP

pre-tax that Spain now claims is a “reasonable return” under Regulatory Framework
11.8 In the alternative, Claimants argue, by committing to the regime in RD 661/2007,
Spain is deemed to have accepted that the return that Claimants would have earned under
that regime (expected to be between 11.5% and 11.9%) was reasonable, lawful and
appropriate.*°! In either case, in Claimants’ view Spain is now estopped from asserting a

802

contrary position in this proceeding.*’- More specifically, Claimants contend that Spain

cannot now argue that Claimants’ expected project Internal Return Rate (“IRR”) was

unreasonable, or that they were being overcompensated.°°>

Claimants also object to the contention that any commitments to preserve the regime in
RD 661/2007 would be invalid under Spanish law for being incompatible with the
dynamism inherent in the notion of “reasonable return.” Claimants argue that they relied
on “unique specific assurances” by senior Spanish Government officials that the
Termosol Plants would receive the specific revenues in RD 661/2007 (not a “reasonable
return”), which they were entitled to assume were in accordance with Spanish law, and a

State cannot rely on domestic law to justify breach of international obligations.

Claimants reject Respondent’s contention that they misunderstood Spanish law in

commitments provided to the Claimants were likely to be honoured.”*"” Claimants add
that their legal due diligence included meetings with and letters with senior Spanish

officials, to confirm their understanding of the regulatory regime in place.*°*

441. Claimants also argue that Respondent’s allegations about insufficient due diligence are
both unfair and misguided as a matter of international law. According to Claimants,
“Tilnsufficient due diligence by investors (which was not the case here) does not relieve
the host States of their obligations, including their positive duty ‘to ensure investors are
not misled and are made to realise where the ‘true’ directions of government policy for

the issue at stake.””*°

442. Claimants also deny that they knew that Spain would alter the remuneration system
applicable to the Termosol Plants.*"° In particular, Claimants argue that (i) they were not
put on notice that “reasonable return” was an overriding concept and the only guarantee
— a notion that is an objective for the Spanish legislator and not a mandated form of
return that overrides other commitments, and which was superseded by the specific tariffs
and premiums set forth in RD 661/2007;*"! (ii) the prior regulatory interventions in the
PV sector did not foreshadow the changes to the remuneration system applicable to the
Termosol Plants — the dynamics of the PV and CSP sectors were very different, and

Moreover, “[e]ven if the
Claimants had assumed the risk of regulatory change (they did not), that risk would have

regime (in other situations). In particular, Claimants argue that: (i) the question of breach
of the FET is to be resolved under the ECT (not Spanish law); and (ii) even taking

(vi) The Self-Sufficiency Excuse Fails in Fact and Law

Claimants oppose Spain’s reliance on the Electricity Law to import the principle of self

Claimants (i)
deny that the Spanish electricity system was designed to be self-sufficient or closed, and
argue that this was not the case at the time they invested since the principle was
introduced as a binding parameter in December 2012, and it is not an absolute one; ** (ii)
argue that it is Respondent who “determines (in large part) the costs and revenues of the
system” so that “if there is a shortfall, it is because Spain has decided to price electricity
at a level that does not reflect its true cost, or because Spain has included in the basket of
electricity system costs other measures that [...] could have been financed from the State
budget [...],” and as such, Spain can hardly invoke its self-generated insufficiency to
justify a breach of the ECT;%”° (iii) contend that “Spain had previously assured investors
that the costs of the Special Regime had to be assessed in light of its enormous benefits”
of renewable energy, but it now forgets that, and “weighs the costs of the system without

balancing them against these critical wider benefits;”°°

Framework III goes too far and imposes excessive cuts, even by the “self-sufficiency”

standard.*?7

(vii) The Installed Capacity Excuse Fails in Fact and Law

Claimants argue that the final registration into the RAIPRE entitled the Termosol Plants

to receive the benefits of the Special Regime contained in RD 661/2007, and oppose

Respondent’s allegation that the Termosol Plants are not entitled to benefit from that

regime because each plant has an installed capacity in excess of 50 MW.*?8 Claimants

explain that the issue revolves around Article 27 of the Electricity Law, which provides

that electricity generation activities can fall under the Special Regime “whenever they are

carried out from facilities having installed capacity of no more than 50 MW,” and RD

661/2007 which addresses the conditions the plants qualifying for the Special Regime

must meet, and deals with power of the facilities in Article 3(1).°°? Claimants contend

that:

The “Termosol Plants are in full compliance with the Special Regime requirements
under Spanish law,” because (i) the expression “installed capacity” in Article 27 of
the Electricity Law equates to “nominal capacity”; (ii) Article 3(1) of RD
661/2007 provides two reference points to determine nominal power: the nominal
capacity of the plant itself, or the nominal power of the generator as displayed on
the specifications nameplate; (iii) the nominal capacity of the Termosol Plants is
49.9 MW; and (iy) in the alternative, even if Article 3(1) of RD 661/2007 referred
to the nominal power of the generator/alternator as displayed on the nameplate, the
plants comply with that test too.°

Spain’s “novel interpretation of the installed capacity of a power plant’ is “not
supported by Spanish law or industry practice.”*! The gross generation at the
generator level is not the qualifying factor.*°

“Spain’s interpretation of the law is also not consistent with how the Claimants,
other renewable producers and Spanish authorities interpreted the 50 MW limit.”
For instance, the Spanish authority that registered the Termosol Plants into the
RAIPRE and authorized their inclusion into the Special Regime shared Claimants’
understanding of the 50MW limit.*%

Spain is estopped from asserting that the Termosol Plants don’t qualify for the
Special regime because (i) “the qualification of the Termosol Plants under the

Special Regime was confirmed by various administrative organs of the Spanish
State in full knowledge of the actual capacity of the generators at the Termosol
Plants,” and (ii) inspections carried out in September 2014 by the CNMC for the
express purpose of checking compliance with the Special Regime presupposed that
a net output of 49.9MW was compliant.**4

. In any event, Claimants argue, “[g]iven that the Termosol Plants were duly
approved by the Junta de Extremadura, the current proceedings are not the right
forum to second guess the approval granted by Spain’s own organs.” According
to Claimants, “[t]he central Government of Spain has no power to revoke
authorisations issued by a competent regional authority to a CSP plant or to
revoke its inscription in the RAIPRE.”**

448. Claimants have also submitted that Respondent’s installed capacity argument has already

been denied by another tribunal ruling on the Spanish measures.**°

449. As aresult of allegations made at the Hearing, Claimants further opposed the contention
that the Termosol Plants should not be compensated for all the electricity they deliver to
the grid, but instead, some should be reclassified as internal consumption.*?7 For
Claimants, that contention is logically flawed,®°* inconsistent with Spanish law,®?? and
procedurally improper giving its timing.*#? In addition, Claimants also deny that they
have always been aware that Termosol Plants were only permitted to export 44.9 MW to
the grid under the Special Regime, and have deliberately sought to receive an
overpayment.**! According to Claimants, this submission ignores that Spanish officials
were made aware of the capacity of the Termosol Plants.*“? Claimants contend that they
legitimately expected that the Termosol Plants would be able to deliver 49.9 MW under

the Special Regime for their lifetime.*#*

(viii) Breach of the Expectations

Claimants argue that, contrary to the commitments given to them stressing legal stability,
Spain has “retroactively rewritten the legal framework” basis of the Claimants’
investment, with changes that are so severe that have more than decimated the value of
their equity in NEE Espafia, and do not provide the expected return on their

investment.*#4

In particular, Claimants point out that: (i) RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010 have been
abolished; (ii) the regulated feed-in-tariff and the pool + premium option have been
abolished; (iii) the market price remuneration is subject to a new 7% levy on revenue;
(iv) electricity generated through natural gas only receives the prevailing market price;
(v) the revenue-based remuneration system has been replaced with a “retroactive system
of payments based on installed capacity;” (vi) Regulatory Framework III produces unfair

and inequitable results;*#°

(vii) the remuneration is no longer payable for the life of the
plant, but is limited to a 25 year regulatory useful life; (viti) indexation of the tariffs to
the Consumer Price Index has been abolished; and (ix) the return has been reduced to

7.4% pre-tax and is calculated over a cost base that excludes important costs.*“°

In Claimants’ view, Regulatory Framework III is a complete departure from Regulatory
Framework I, as recognized by the CNE, with changes so far-reaching that they crossed

the threshold of unfair treatment for purposes of Article 10(1) of the ECT.**”

For Claimants, the results of Regulatory Framework III are unfair and inequitable,
because the new framework: (i) fixes the Net Value of the Asset (“NVA”) of the
Termosol Plants at levels far below their actual investment costs and applying it
retroactively; (ii) excludes from the NVA reasonable costs such as financing costs during

construction;** (iii) ignores Claimants’ actual costs for plants that are the only type in

their regulatory category; (iv) introduces arbitrary limits on operating hours and
regulatory useful lives of the plants; (v) subjects the NVA to a rate of return of 5.2%
after-tax which is well below a reasonable return, and even below the minimum 7% after-
tax rate that Spain had previously admitted as reasonable; (vi) yields revenues insufficient
to meet the PTEs’ debt obligations triggering events of default and mandatory
liquidation; (vii) caused NEE Espaiia to write off its equity investment in the PTEs,

thereby making Claimants’ equity investments “virtually worthless.*”

According to Claimants, as of June 2014 the value of their equity in NEE Espajia had
been cut from EUR 397.4 to EUR 15.5 million.*°° Those figures were later updated, and
in its latest expert report, Claimants’ experts stated that the drop in value of equity in
NEE Espafia as of June 2016 had been from EUR 450.6 to EUR 41.7 million.®°!
Claimants further contend the revenues of the Termosol Plants have been cut “in the

order of 36%.

(ix) The EC Decision of 10 November 2017 on State Aid

Claimants argue that, contrary to Spain’s allegations, the EC Decision of 10 November
2017,°°3 which approved Regulatory Framework III from a State Aid perspective, does
not alter Respondent’s violation of Claimants’ legitimate expectations in breach of
Article 10(1) of the ECT.°™

First, Claimants contend that the EC Decision is irrelevant to the assessment of Spain’s
liability because it contains no substantive analysis of Regulatory Framework I, or the

critical factors giving rise to Claimants’ expectations.**> It decides only that Regulatory

Framework III does not violate the EU State Aid regime, but declines to assess

Regulatory Framework I given that such framework has been replaced.**°

In addition, in Claimants’ view, the EC generic remarks about legitimate expectations of
investors under EU Law are obiter, out of context of the facts of this case, and without
reference to principles of international law.**” Claimants deny that EU Law trumps the
ECT in the event of inconsistency, and instead argue that the Tribunal is mandated to
apply the ECT over EU Law in the event of inconsistency.*°* Claimants deny that under
EU Law, Spain’s failure to notify the EC of Regulatory Framework I in 2007 forecloses
any claim of legitimate expectations.**? According to Claimants, Spain’s alleged failure
to notify State Aid cannot affect liability under Article 10(1) of the ECT, because (i) a
State cannot invoke its own breach of domestic law as an excuse for violating
international law (ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Articles 7 and 32); and (ii)
investors protected by a treaty are entitled to assume that an EU Member State is acting

lawfully when it enacts legislation intending to attract investment.°

In any event, Claimants argue, it is also wrong to assume that State Aid principles are
engaged with respect to Regulatory Framework I, for reasons of: (i) timing — neither
Spain, nor investors considered Regulatory Framework I a source of notifiable State Aid
until 2014; and (ii) substance — in Regulatory Framework I the funds were paid by the

861

private consumers, not the State. For Claimants, this is significant because the Parties

are in agreement that the legitimate expectations are to be assessed at the time of the

£86

investment and as of December 2010 no reasonable investor could have been aware

that Spain might have acted unlawfully. And, since Claimants’ case on legitimate

expectations under the ECT is not substantively inconsistent with State Aid rules, the

Tribunal need not address the issue of priority between the ECT and EU Law in this

respect.°*

459. Second, Claimants contend that, even if Claimants’ expectations were to be determined
under EU Law rather than the ECT (which they don’t accept), the EC Decision shows no

inconsistency between EU Law and Claimants’ case under the ECT.*®

460. Claimants argue that no diligent businessman would have foreseen that Regulatory
Framework I was notifiable State Aid, given that between 2007-2014 the EC never
directed Spain to notify Regulatory Framework I as State Aid, and the notification was
only made in December 2014.° Claimants acted diligently in 2010 believing that Spain
had acted lawfully in enacting Regulatory Framework I, and their legitimate expectations
at the time of their investment are not affected by the CJEU Elcogas ruling of October
2014 which obliged the notification of the support measures for renewable energy, or by

Spain’s failure to notify.5%

461. Furthermore, the EC Decision does not conclude that Regulatory Framework I was
incompatible with the levels of aid permitted under State Aid law guidelines at the
relevant time, and indeed EU Law permits and indeed encourages State aid to facilitate
renewable energy.*** Even if there was a formal defect due to Spain’s failure to notify
Regulatory Framework I, Claimants argue, “substantively there is nothing unlawful in the
type of remuneration which the Claimants seek in this proceeding” vis-a-vis State Aid
rules.* Far from ordering Spain to terminate Regulatory Framework I, the EC criticized
Spain for dismantling it, and Spain never asserted at the time that the 2013-2014 changes

were necessary to comply with State Aid rules.5”°

Claimants add that Spain is estopped from asserting State Aid as a defence, because at the
time of the investment the EC had been fully aware of Regulatory Framework I for three

years and had taken no step to investigate it or to assert any violation of State Aid law.57!

Third, Claimants argue that “[e]ven if Spain had proven: (i) that RF I was substantively in
breach of EU State aid rules, and (ii) that Spain repealed RD 661/2007 for State aid
reasons (neither of which it has established), the Spanish Government was still under an
ECT obligation to respect the Claimants’ legitimate expectations through alternative

measures, insofar as State aid rules allowed.”

Finally, in Claimants’ view, matters of enforcement of an Award in this case are not a
relevant consideration for the Tribunal, and the EC is wrong to suggest that enforcement

of an Award in favour of Claimants would violate EU Law.8”3

“objective” and “derived from the specific circumstances at the time of investing in the

For Respondent, the ECT is not an insurance policy against regulatory changes: (i) it is
necessary to establish “specific commitments” made to an investor that a regulation will
remain unchanged; (ii) expectations must be reasonable and justified in connection with
changes in the host-State laws; (iii) an investor is required to conduct a preliminary and
comprehensive analysis of the legal framework applicable to its investment, taking into
account the due diligence it has conducted, anticipating that circumstances can change,
and structuring its investment to be able to adapt to potential changes in the legal

framework.*”

According to Spain, the framework was established on the basis of certain essential
principles that would form the “objective legitimate expectations of any investor,”
namely: (i) the principle of hierarchy of rules; (ii) the notion that the 1997 Electricity
Law was the basis of the system, with regulations being subject to that law and to the
case law of the Supreme Court; (iii) the fundamental principle that the subsidies of the
Special Regime are a cost to the electricity system, subordinated to the principle of
economic sustainability of that system; (iv) the principle that the remuneration system for

the Special Regime seeks to provide renewable energy producers a “reasonable return”

according to the capital market and considering the investment costs for the type of
facility; (v) the principle of “reasonable return,” and the resulting dynamic character of
the remuneration system under the Special Regime; (vi) the notion that premiums were
calculated based on changes in demand and other economic data; (vii) the notion that
regulatory changes in the Special Regime system — including some prior to Claimants’
investment — were motivated by the need to correct overcompensation, or to correct
strong alteration of the economic data that served as basis for the initial configuration of

the system. **?

In light of these principles, Respondent says, Claimants could not have legitimately
expected that the State would refrain from adopting measures to resolve an economic
imbalance impacting the sustainability of the system, or to resolve situations of over-

remuneration.**3

Respondent emphasizes that the renewable energy system in Spain has always been built
around the principle of “reasonable return,” set forth in Article 30(4) of the 1997
Electricity Law, and which remains in Article 14(7) of Law 24/2013.°°4 And this
principle, Respondent contends, is characterized by (i) balancing the costs of the
premiums with the return to the investor; (ii) being dynamic, meaning that it can be
adapted to the circumstances; (iii) providing a guarantee to the investor; (iv) being
referenced, meaning that it may not be arbitrarily set by the Government but rather, it
must be referenced to the “cost of money in capital markets,” and (v) imposing on the
regulator an obligation of concrete result, while not requiring a particular set
mechanism.**° According to Respondent, the various regulations that have developed the
1997 Electricity Law (referring to, RD 2818/1998, RD 436/2004, RD 661/2007, and RD

1614/2010) “have had the objective of setting at each historical moment the ‘reasonable

situations.”°8°

Spain further contends that “the existing regulatory framework, at the time when the
Claimant made its investment, allowed regulatory changes to existing facilities, while
maintaining the principle of reasonable return.”**’ The Spanish regulatory framework,
Spain says, contained no specific commitment to the immutability of the regime in RD
661/2007, RDL 6/2009 and RD 1614/2010.*** The only commitment assumed by Spain
was to maintain a “reasonable return.”®®° And, as reasonable return is an end that can be
achieved through various means, no investor could have a legitimate expectation to a

specific formula.’ The Spanish regulation for the Special Regime was never enacted to

 

attract foreign investment.**!

Respondent thus denies that any of the rules relied upon by Claimants “contain any
reference to or guarantee of the freezing of a particular subsidy scheme.”*? In

particular, Respondent argues the following with respect to the various instruments:

. 1997 Electricity Law. Respondent denies that the entire electricity system was
based on market liberalization (abandoning the principle of compensation for
costs).°%

. RD 2818/1998 and RD 1432/2002. Respondent argues that neither of these
decrees froze the remuneration conditions, and it contends that both demonstrate
that since the 1997 Electricity Law the only guarantee was “reasonable return,”
not a specific formula for its calculation.°™*

. RD 436/2004. Respondent points out that this decree contained a provision
identical to Article 44 of RD 661/2007, which did not prevent modification of the
remuneration regime contained in it.*°>

. RD 661/2007. Respondent argues that this decree develops the 1997 Electricity
Law and the principle of “reasonable return” as the basis of the system, and denies
that Article 44(3) operated a stabilization clause to prevent any regulatory change
or any revision of the regulated tariff. According to Respondent, Article 44(3)
only deals with the compulsory adjustments due every four years.*°° Moreover,
Respondent argues, Claimants’ case is contradictory in arguing both that RD
661/2007 was a determining factor in their decision to invest, but also that this
decree was not enough to entice them to take the investment beyond the
preliminary phase.**’ Respondent further denies that this decree (or the 2005-2010
Renewable Energy Plan) was enacted to attract foreign investment.***

. RDL 6/2009. According to Respondent, the object of this decree was to address
the tariff deficit, and Claimants knew that it was not unalterable and recognized the
risk that it be repealed together with RD 661/2007.8 Respondent denies that the
fourth and fifth transitory provisions froze the rates and premiums established in
RD 661/2007. It further contends that the inscription in the Pre-Assignment
Registry created by this decree was a necessary condition but not the only one to
receive the right to the regime in RD 661/2007.”°!

. RD 1614/2010. For Respondent, “far from guaranteeing the unmodifiability of the
remuneration system,” this decree “was limited to saving the staggering of the
rollout implied by RD-L 6/2009 and the Council of Ministers Agreement of 13th
November 2009.” Article 4 was intended to prevent that plants affected by the
staggering were impacted by the tariff review scheduled for 2010, but provided no
stabilization clause against subsequent revisions or amendments. The decree also
emphasized the need to ensure a “reasonable return” as the cornerstone of the
system.°

also serve to support Respondent’s case:

. RDL 14/2010. According to Respondent, this provision enacted a few days after
RD 1614/2010 introduced an access fee to all producers, and decreased the
remuneration of the Termosol Plants.°”

. Law 2/2011. This law, passed in March 2011 (which, according to Respondent,
pre-dates the investment), announced the necessary reform to the sector, thus
giving notice that the new standards would be approved.°™

According to Respondent, Claimants’ case ignores that a diligent investor should have

been aware that rights and duties are imposed by different regulations, which are

structured hierarchically. As a result, regulations cannot contradict the provisions of a

higher-ranking norm, such as a Law.*°> As RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010 were

subordinate to the 1997 Electricity Law, they could not contradict its provisions.°°° And
given that the 1997 Electricity Law pivots on the principle of sustainability of the Spanish

Electricity System, a diligent investor should have known that RD 661/2007 could not

°°7 nor could a

freeze the remuneration regime as this would infringe that principle;
diligent investor expect stability of a regime generating levels of profitability that were
not reasonable, as that would be contrary to the principle of “reasonable return”

enshrined in the 1997 Electricity Law.°°*

Respondent rejects Claimants’ contention that the principle of reasonable return was
superseded by the system in RD 661/2007, and instead argues that such principle “sets

out any rights or expectations of investors in the Spanish regulatory framework.”

Respondent also takes the view that the regulatory evolution in fact demonstrates that
there was no commitment to stability. Thus, Spain observes that prior to Article 44(3) of
RD 661/2007, RD 436/2004 contained a similar provision in Article 40(3), which did not
prevent the modification of the regime through RD 661/2007. In addition, after RD
661/2007, other amendments were made through RD 1578/2008, RDL 6/2009, RD

existing facilities despite the wording of Article 44 (3) of RD 661/2007.7!°

Moreover, Respondent argues, Claimants did not believe that RD 661/2007, RDL 6/2009
or RD 1614/2010 contained a stabilization clause, nor could they have legitimately done
so. Respondent observes that (i) 2007 and 2008 reports by the CNE and the Attorney
General’s Office reflect Claimants’ awareness that regulatory changes could impact
existing plants; (ii) no due diligence has been provided confirming the existence of these
stabilization clauses; (iii) the enactment of RD 1614/2010 and RDL 14/2010 showed that
the Government would not hesitate to introduce modifications to the regime to ensure the
sustainability of the system; (iv) after the alleged commitments in RD 1614/2010,
Claimants entered into several contracts that included change in law protections; (v)
Claimants and Protermosolar pushed for the introduction in RD 1614/2010 of language
incorporating an obligation of the Secretary of State to issue individual decisions
determining the compensation regime for the life of the facility, which was ultimately not
accepted;?!! and (vi) in March 2011, before the financing agreements were entered into,
the Government enacted Law 2/2011, which announced necessary and desired reforms to

the Spanish Electricity System.°!”

Domestic Case Law. Respondent contends that the Supreme Court case law is significant
to determine the extension and limits of Claimants’ rights and expectations at the time of
their investments.*!? Thus, Respondent submits that the principle of “reasonable return”
has been the subject of numerous cases in Spanish courts, which have “established that
this principle does not imply that the remuneration set a certain point cannot be
changed” and instead hold that “the characteristic of this principle is its dynamism

enshrined that the content of this right does not grant producers an unchangeable

acquired right of always receiving the same remuneration amount for its generation

activity.”°!

481. Respondent emphasizes that when ruling on the validity of amendments to the regime in
RD 436/2004 in a judgment in 2006, the Supreme Court “expressly denied the investors

the right to the payment of an unchangeable tariff,” it only acknowledged the right to a

916

reasonable return,”’° and it also confirmed that amendments to the remuneration system

did not contradict the principles of legal certainty or legitimate expectations.°!”
According to Respondent, the Supreme Court subsequently confirmed that there was no
acquired right to a premium in two judgments in 2007;°!® and later, in a series of three
judgements in 2009, it also confirmed that there was no right to the economic

immutability of the system in RD 436/2004, despite the provisions in Article 40(3) of that

decree,*!? and reiterated the same principle in the context of appeals against the

remuneration framework in RD 661/2007.°”

renewable sources in Spain, is based on an essential principle [...] of ‘reasonable

could not base a claim relating to the right or legitimate expectations to which the

premium regime remains indefinitely unchanged in any economic circumstances.”??

483. Respondent goes on to add that the case law on the limits of the principle of reasonable
return was further reiterated by the Supreme Court in a long series of judgements
rendered from April to November 2012, in the context of challenges to the amendments
to RD 661/2007 via RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010.°** Spain highlights that, in those
judgments, the Court ruled that the principle of reasonable return did not guarantee a
right to a regulated tariff for a given period of time, or to receive a certain remuneration

925

throughout the entire operational lifetime of a facility,*“° and also denied the notion that a

certain rate of return could remain unaltered.°*° Those rulings, Spain says, have also
been reiterated in 2013 and 2016 judgements dealing with challenges related to RD
1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010,””” and in judgments of the Constitutional Court in 2015
and 2016 in connection with RDL 9/2013, which confirm that the amendments to the
system conformed to the principles of legal certainty and legitimate expectations,
regulatory hierarchy and non-retroactivity.°?* Respondent explains that the judgements
that post-date the investment are still relevant in that they confirm the principles

previously established in the earlier cases.°”°

applicable here because Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 introduced grandfathering

commitments that prior regulations did not include, Spain contends that Article 4

contains no such commitment.’ Respondent further contends that several key players,
including the Supreme Court itself, the CNE, and Protermosolar recognize the

importance of the Supreme Court case law, contradicting Claimants’ contentions.”*!

Lastly, Respondent observes that, in Charanne, the tribunal concluded that RD 661/2007
did not contain a specific commitment towards claimants’ investments; absent a specific
commitment, an investor could not have legitimate expectations that RD 661/2007 would
remain unchanged throughout the life of the plant; and the decisions of the Supreme

2

Court were relevant facts to reach these conclusions.?°? In addition, relying on AES,

Respondent further submits that in the ECT context, a stability clause cannot be deduced

from a general regulatory framework.?*

Economic Circumstances. Respondent further maintains that Spain was facing a difficult
economic situation well known to the solar thermal sector, which required safeguarding
the sustainability of the Spanish Electricity System. The remuneration system for the
Special Regime was not reflecting the standard of “reasonable return.” These elements,
Respondent argues, were the driving force behind the measures taken, and were
recognized in the rules immediately preceding Claimants’ investment, i.e. RDL 6/2009
and RDL 14/2010.°** Respondent adds that the memoranda for RDL 6/2009 and RDL
14/2010 “demonstrate that the Claimant was fully aware that (i) the system of incentives
for renewable energies under no circumstances could allow for over remuneration
against the principle of reasonable return, (ii) the overall costs of the Special Regime had
contributed significantly to the deficit, (iii) the difficulties of [the Spanish Electricity
System] should be resolved internally and (iv) Spain had taken and would continue to
take measures to ensure the sustainability of [the Spanish Electricity System].”°*

RD 1614/2010.°°° In these circumstances, Respondent says, no diligent investor could

expect that while the tariff deficit was unresolved Spain would stop taking measures.”*7

It follows, Respondent argues, that Claimants were aware that in 2009 and 2010 (prior to
the Claimants’ investments) the Government had already corrected imbalances in the
system of renewable energy (including thermosolar), and knew that these actions were

38 Claimants

based on the guiding principle of ensuring the sustainability of the system.
were also aware, Respondent argues, that the imbalance in other technologies (PV) had
caused the regulator to take action to restore the “reasonable return,’ and were aware
that adjustments would continue to be adopted as long as the sustainability of the system
remained at risk or situations of overcompensation affected the principle of reasonable

return.?°?

(ii) Source of the Expectations

In addition to the alleged errors in the description of the Spanish regulatory framework,
Respondent also denies that the other sources presented by Claimants could have validly

served as basis for the expectations they allege to have had.

Pre-Assignment Registry of RDL 6/2009. According to Spain, the purpose of RDL
6/2009 was to confront the tariff deficit, not to freeze the legal system; and entry into the
Pre-Assignment Registry “did not grant by itself a right to the economic regime laid-
down by Royal Decree 661/2007.*° Moreover, the regime was subordinate to the

dynamism of the concept of “reasonable return"!

The 28 December 2010 Resolutions. Respondent denies that these documents confirm
any commitment or constitute any new commitment to maintain the RD 661/2007
regime. According to Spain, they (i) merely informed what the current regime was at the

time the communication was being issued with respect to two issues (payment conditions

expectations;*?

and (iii) were merely communications, not an administrative

did not believe that RD 1614/2010 contained any commitment to stability, because
otherwise, the Termosol Plants would have never sought the additional commitment they

hoped to get with these resolutions.*4>

491. Alleged Assurances by High Government Officials. Respondent argues that (i) none of
the communications relied upon by Claimants in this proceeding were authored by
Claimants or addressed to them; (ii) the communications authored by Spain answered to
NextEra U.S letters, but were not sent on Spain’s initiative; (iii) the communications
cannot be interpreted outside of their context, and some are authored by NextEra U.S.
officials attributing statements to the Government of Spain that have not been verified;
(iv) the letters of 21 and 22 April 2010 to the Minister for Industry and to the Prime
Minister were not answered by Spain, and accordingly, Spain has not confirmed the
interpretation of the legal regime embodied in those letters; (v) the number of letters sent
contradicts the notion that the letters generated any expectations of stability; (vi)

signed in December 2010 after another of the letters was sent and even after RD
1614/2010 was enacted included a clause for regulatory risk; and the credit agreement
with the bank syndicate signed in April 2011 contemplates “regulatory changes” and

letters pre-date the approval of RD 1614/2010, RDL 14/2010 and Law 2/2011, and

2010, before this dispute arose and before RD 1614/2010 was enacted, Claimants were
indeed aware that a reform of the system was imminent and did not believe that there was

a commitment to the petrification of RD 661/2007.°*

RAIPRE Registration. Relying on Charanne, Respondent argues that no diligent investor
could have legitimately expected that registration into the RAIPRE entitled it to the
freezing of the RD 661/2007 regime, as the RAIPRE was merely an administrative
requirement to sell energy.?+ Respondent also contends that Claimants’ argument as to
the RAIPRE is based only on Article 4 of RD 1614/2010, overseeing that the regulatory
regime included also the 1997 Electricity Law, other regulations and the case law of the
Supreme Court, which make it clear that the only guarantee was of a return on the

investment, but not of a specific system.?>

Agreement with the Thermosolar Sector. Respondent denies that this alleged agreement
of 2 July 2010 could have been source of expectations, arguing that Protermosolar’s
actions thereafter in 2012 did not refer to any such agreement, nor did the PTEs do so
during the consultation process for RD 1614/2010.°°° Respondent further denies that the
enactment of RD 1614/2010 was the result of a negotiation with the sector, or that there
was ever an agreement with the sector, arguing that the alleged negotiation process on
which Claimants rely was simply the normal consultation procedure for the enactment of

the decree, and that the 2 July 2010 “agreement” was simply a part of that process.”

Foreign Investment Campaign. Respondent denies that a worldwide campaign to attract
foreign investment was launched by Spain.?* Spain (i) maintains that Claimants have
never demonstrated that the presentations of InvestinSpain or the CNE on which they rely
were ever known and relied upon by Claimants to invest; (ii) argues that the presentations

pre-date the alleged investment by several years; and (iii) disputes Claimants’

Respondent further submits that
InvestinSpain was a private law entity without public prerogatives, and that the CNE
presentations were merely educational and not for advertising or investment

development.*”

Change of Law Provisions. According to Respondent, Claimants “never believed” in the
alleged commitments that they now invoke, as shown by contracts signed after the
enactments of RD 661/2007, RDL 6/2009 and RD 1614/2010.°°! Respondent refers to
(i) the Project Development Agreement with Casas de Hitos, which Respondent says
contemplates the possibility that RD 661/2007 might be repealed or replaced;°™ (ii) the
Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contract, signed in December 2009,
foreseeing that the rates in Article 36 of RD 661/2007 might be modified;*® (iii) an
amendment to the Development Agreement, signed in December 2010 including a clause

964

for regulatory ris and (iv) the credit agreement with the bank syndicate signed in

April 2011, which contemplates “regulatory risk” and “changes in law.”°°

Respondent further submits that other evidence submitted by Claimants serves to refute
the allegations of legitimate expectations, including a proposal submitted by
Protermosolar to the Ministry in June 2010 concerning measures to address the tariff
deficit, containing a proposal for amendment of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 and

recognizing State liability in the event of change, which was ultimately not accepted —

661/2007.°°

(iii) The Timeline of the Investment and Expectations

Referring to Claimants’ depiction of the timeline of their equity contributions to NEE
Espafia, Respondent highlights that by March 2010 the Government had already
announced its intention to amend the regime for CSP installations in RD 661/2007, and
nonetheless Claimants allegedly made significant equity contributions.” Spain further
denies that the 2011-2020 Renewable Energy Plan provided any certainty about the
regime, and it argues that, in fact it acknowledged the possibility of future amendments to

tariffs and premiums.

Recalling that, in its view, the expectations must be assessed as of 28 April 2011 (date of
the bank financing contracts),°° Respondent observes that by then numerous facts had
occurred that undermine Claimants’ legitimate expectations case: (i) RDL 14/2010 of 23
December 2010 had already been enacted, introducing toll access fees for all renewable
energy producers, thereby reducing the remuneration and undermining Claimants’
allegation of immutability of the returns;?” (ii) Law 2/2011 had just been enacted,
announcing an imminent reform to the electricity sector;”! (iii) it was public knowledge
that the first international arbitration arising out of the measures in the PV sector had
been brought;?”? (iv) neither the CSP sector or the wind sector had argued the
immutability of the regime;?’? (v) the renewable energy target in the 2005-2010
Renewable Energy Plan had already been fulfilled.”

In addition, Respondent argues, in January 2011, the Minister of Industry, Tourism and
Trade advised that the measures taken during 2009 and 2010 were not sufficient, and that

further measures had to be taken.?”>

Lastly, since 2007 and 2008, Respondent contends, Claimants were aware of the risk that
“the Spanish Regulatory Framework, while respecting acquired rights, could establish
reforms going forwards that are applicable to pre-existing situations such as plants in

operation,” and they still decided to make their investment in 2011.97

(iv) No Legitimate Expectations: Due Diligence and Supreme Court Case

Law
Respondent contends that Claimants have failed to show that at the time of investment in
April 2011, Claimants had conducted due diligence with respect to the alleged
commitments under RD 661/2007, RDL 6/2009 and RD 1614/2010.” After criticizing
Claimants for relying on legal privilege to avoid producing their due diligence reports,
Spain contends that the reports that have been produced were issued much earlier than the

Claimants’ investment.°’*

One of those reports (2008 Péyry Report), Respondent argues, warned Claimants that the
renewable energy support mechanisms were contingent upon the economic sustainability
of the system; referred to the changes in the PV sector, and advised Claimants that the
risk now lied with the CSP sector.°”? According to Spain, the report further warned
Claimants about “(/) the effects that the increase in the tariff deficit might have, and (2)
the Government's commitment to provide a Reasonable rate of return through subsidies”
and it “does not contain a single mention of the existence of any stabilisation clause in

RD 661/2007.”°°

Respondent further takes issue with the contention that the case law of the Supreme Court
was not relevant in the formation of the expectations, and argues that as a result of
Claimants’ disregard of this case law their expectations were neither real nor objective.”*!
Moreover, Respondent contends that the evidence indeed shows that Claimants were
aware of the case law of the Supreme Court, but there is no evidence that they examined

it or requested due diligence about it.°*?

(v) No Legitimate Expectations: The Installed Capacity of the Termosol

Plants.
Respondent contends that the Termosol Plants have an installed capacity that exceeds 50
MW, and as result are not entitled to the economic regime set forth in Article 36 of RD
661/2007 (instead, they are only entitled to the regime in Article 45 of that decree). In
consequence, Respondent argues, Claimants could not have legitimate expectations that

their plants would receive the regime in Article 36 of RD 661/2007 for 30 years.”*

According to Spain, Claimants knew or should have known that the installed power of
the installations could not exceed SOMW.°** Respondent points out that Article 27 of the
1997 Electricity Law required as an “essential condition” that in order to qualify for the
regime in Article 36 of RD 661/2007 the installations had an “installed capacity [...] no
greater than SOMW.®> In addition, the CNE was also clear about the requirement,

when answering public questions about the regime in a 2008 report.?*°

Emphasizing the term “installed” power, Respondent argues that the requirement also
excluded installations with an installed power exceeding SOMW, with necessary

987

management to ensure delivery of only 49.99 MW to the grid.”*’ Respondent refutes

Claimants’ contention that the notion of “installed power’ should be determined by

reference to Article 3 of RD 661/2007 referring to the specifications in the name plate of

the motor or alternator, observing that the CNE contradicts this contention.°**

According to Respondent, the technical due diligence attached to Claimants’ own expert
reports shows that Claimants were not in compliance with the requirement, as they have
installed power greater than SOMW.**? In addition, Respondent argues, the data for

1:99

electricity production discharged to the network also confirms i and Claimants

themselves have admitted that the plants are over the power limits.”! The expert opinion

of Mr. Jestis Casanova further supports the argument.”

This said, Respondent
emphasizes that it has never verified or calculated empirically the installed power of the

Termosol Plants, because Claimants have not allowed it.°??

Spain also opposes the contention that the principle of estoppel prevents Spain from
raising this argument. According to Respondent, Spain has never stated that the
Termosol Plants were not overpowered (and in fact, it has never verified the installed
capacity empirically).°* Moreover, Respondent contends, (i) estoppel is not a principle
recognized in Spain, and is also not applicable here as it is already embodied in the FET
standard; (ii) the registration in the RAIPRE was based on compliance with
administrative requirements (not technical ones); (iii) the CNE verified only that the
plants had the documents and permits necessary to operate, but did not conduct an
empirical power test; (iv) the “Electricity System” is a technical operator and not an

administrative control body, and as such, it does not do verifications of the economic

regime a facility had or should have had;°%> and (v) Claimants have concealed their real

installed power on the nameplate, thereby preventing Respondent from verifying it.?°°

(vi) The EC Decision of 10 November 2017 on State Aid

According to Respondent, the EC Decision is binding not only on Spain, but also on this
Tribunal, because EU Law is international law applicable pursuant to Article 26(6) of the
ECT, and EC decisions are part of EU Law.”

On this basis, Respondent contends that the FET standard cannot have a broader scope
than the EU notions of legal certainty and legitimate expectations in the context of a State

Aid regime;?”*

and the CJEU’s doctrine on legitimate expectations, legal certainty,
transparency and retroactivity is to be taken into account when determining the content of

the standard in Article 10(1) of the ECT.”””

In Respondent’s view, any investor in the renewable energy sector in Spain should have
known that the support scheme for renewable energy: (i) constituted State Aid, and as
such no investor could expect that it would be preserved; (ii) must be compliant with the
rule of proportionality; (iii) was aimed at achieving a reasonable return until the plants
reached a level playing field; (iv) was limited in its duration until such level playing field
was achieved; and (v) was subject to continue State review.!°" This follows, Respondent
says, from the fact that the renewable energy scheme was passed in accordance with EU
Directives 2001/77 and 2009/28, which recognized the need for State Aid in favour of

renewable energy.!°°!

These EU guidelines, Respondent adds, demonstrate that Spain was required to guarantee

the reasonability and proportionality of the rates of return by renewable energy

generators, and to adapt the remuneration regime to ensure both objectives. !°°?

Accordingly, renewable generators “could not seek to obtain, sine die, the tariffs and

premiums of RD 661/2007.” °°

Spain further points out that the EC Decision concludes that the subsidies granted by
Spain constitute State Aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the TFEU, and that
there is no right to State Aid. It follows, Respondent says, that the rights Claimants
allege to have are inexistent both under international law or domestic law.!°4 Relying on
the EC Decision, Respondent emphasizes that “a recipient of State aid cannot, in
principle, have legitimate expectations in the lawfulness of aid that has not been notified
to the Commission” and, goes on to argue that, a diligent business man should have been

able to determine whether the State Aid procedure had been followed. !°>

Respondent further submits that: (i) the EC Decision ratified the proportionality and

rationality of the challenged measures;'° (ii) confirmed that the regulatory lifetime set

1007

forth in the current regime is correct and (iii) welcomed the transparency of the new

regime and Spain’s commitment to periodic assessments to guarantee proportionality. !°*
Finally, Respondent observes that the EC Decision dismisses the contention that there has
been an infringement of the FET standard under the ECT; and argues that this Tribunal’s
decision must be “compatible” with the EC’s Decision, given its role as applicable

international law, domestic law, paramount fact and relevant interpretation criterion. !°°

(vii) No Legitimate Expectations Were Breached

According to Respondent, all the challenged measures were foreseeable and consistent

with the principles underlying the Spanish Electricity System.'°'? Contrary to Claimants’

assertions, the new remuneration model does not entail a complete revision from the prior

one,

and a number of elements were present since the 1997 Electricity Law.!°!'! In

particular, Respondent contends that the new framework:

@)

Maintains the principle of priority of access and dispatch.!!?

Remains built upon the principle of “reasonable return.”!°'? However, while

before the law did not contain a formula for calculating such return, that is now
established with a differential of 300 basic points to the Spanish ten-year bond, and
assumes a profitability of 7.398 pre-tax.!0!4

Maintains the same structure as the prior one: a market price and a subsidy.!°!>

this is both a stand-alone obligation, and one that informs the interpretation of the FET
standard in the ECT.'°7°

In Claimants’ view, the rollercoaster of legal changes in Spain from 2012 to 2014 cannot
be reconciled with Spain’s ECT obligation to provide a stable legal framework, nor were

the measures “sufficiently transparent.”!°>!

(i) Failure to Provide a Stable and Consistent Framework

Claimants submit that Respondent breached this standard by “substantially” modifying
the legal framework basis for their investment, making the new regime retroactive. !°”?
According to Claimants, the changes are so far-reaching that they do not even preserve
their equity outlay.'? Regulatory Framework III is retroactive, Claimants say, because
it applies not only to new plants, but also to existing ones, and it does affect acquired

rights of owners of pre-registered plants.'!°*4

Lack of Stability. For Claimants the changes introduced through Regulatory Framework

Ill are the antithesis of stability:!°%

(i) they completely changed the applicable
remuneration system leaving Claimants with a negative return on their investments; (ii)
they claim to correct overcompensation but there is no evidence that such
overcompensation existed; and (iti) they effectively penalize Claimants for a tariff deficit
of Spain’s own making.'°”° Claimants emphasize that while a State has a right to change
its laws, “that right must be exercised consistently with the commitments it has

undertaken with respect to particular investments and its ECT obligations,”'°?"

Claimants argue that Respondent’s defences to this head of claim lack merit because (i) it

is not true that Regulatory Framework I only guaranteed a “reasonable return,” in fact it

continue to receive a “reasonable return” on their investment, in fact their return is
negative and their equity has been eviscerated; (iii) a State’s sovereign right to enact
legislation must be exercised in accordance with any commitments undertaken towards
investors, including those in the ECT; (iv) it is factually incorrect that Regulatory
Framework III was needed to preserve sustainability of the system and eliminate

overcompensation. !°7

Retroactivity. Claimants contend that Regulatory Framework III is retroactive in
character.!°?? Claimants argue that: (i) Article 1 of RDL 2/2013 reduced the inflation
indexing substituting the Consumer Price Index with a new index, applying the change
retroactively to 1 January 2013;!°° (ii) RDL 9/2013 entered into effect on 14 July 2013,
but it only put in place a basic framework that left undefined key concepts (standard
reference plants, the Investment Payment and the OPEX) which were only defined in
June 2014, which meant that the regulated tariff option continued to apply for almost a
year but subject to a claw-back that operated retroactively from 9 July 2013;'°! (ii)
Regulatory Framework III applies to plants already designed, optimized and built in
reliance on Regulatory Framework I, which makes it especially unfair;!°*?

way, (iv) RD 413/2014 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 apply to plants already

or put another

installed and pre-registered, not only to plants commissioned in the future.!°> According

to Claimants:

“This retroactivity is apparent from the text of RD 413/2014 and
Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, which provides that they apply
retroactively to 13 July 2013, when RD 9/2013 first abolished the feed-in-
tariff and feed-in-premium based renewable remuneration schemes that
had been in place since RD 661/2007, although they were passed in June
2014. In practice, for generators that had started producing before 13
July 2013, the retroactivity of Regulatory Framework III goes even further

as: Regulatory Framework III is not only retroactive to 13 July 2013, as
indicated by the text of the regulation, but goes all the way back to the first
moment of commercial operation, regardless of the date on which
commercial operations commenced.”!°**4

Finally, Claimants argue that Regulatory Framework III is retroactive in that there are
still considerable uncertainties about how it will evolve, including that Spain: (i) retains
the right to add additional parameters to the notion of “standard plant” every three or six
years; (ii) is able to revise and adjust the rate of return every six years; and (iii) retains the
right to withdraw remuneration payment to plants before their estimated useful life, if it

determines that the standard plant has already earned a reasonable return.!°°>

Claimants dispute Respondent’s reliance on the case-law of the Spanish Constitutional
Court in support of the contention that Regulatory Framework III is not retroactive,
arguing that: (i) Spain cannot rely on its own domestic law to justify an international law
breach; and (ii) the Constitutional Court only ruled on a Spanish law question which is

1.!°° Claimants also

completely different from the factual question before the Tribunal
oppose Spain’s reliance on Charanne, arguing that such award relates to a different sector
and is factually different.'°°’ Lastly, Claimants submit that international institutions have

openly criticized Spain for the retroactivity of the measures. !°8

(ii) Failure to Provide a Transparent Framework

Claimants contend that Spain’s conduct also fell short of the transparency standard
imposed by Article 10(1) of the ECT.'°? Claimants articulate that standard by reference

to the decisions in Tecmed, Electrabel and Plama,'°"°

change for wind producers from RD 436/2004 to RD 661/2007 does not evidence that Spanish law allows for
retroactive changes, because the later decree maintained the core features of the regime for the farms registered in
the RAIPRE, improved the remuneration mechanism and only effected a slight retroactive change, and was
implemented in a way that confirms that the legislator knows that retroactive changes could not be introduced

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 213 of 265

In Claimants’ view, Regulatory Framework III violates the ECT requirement of

transparency for a number of reasons, including:!™!

e That “[t]he NVA, OPEX Payment, Investment Payment, operating hour limits,
regulatory useful life and ‘reasonable return’ were determined in secret.”

. That “neither RD 413/2014 nor [Ministerial] Order [IET/1045/2014] explains how
Spain arrived at the new CSP plant categories, nor how Spain determined the
permitted investment and OPEX costs of the ‘standard’ plant against which Spain
measures the Termosol Plants [...]” and “Spain produced no reasoning or
justification for the 3,060 hour cap on annual operating hours that it imposed.” '

. That “Regulatory Framework III does not expressly state what cost items Spain
has allowed (or disallowed) in arriving at the permitted NVA (and thus the
resulting Investment Payment).”'°4

Claimants also argue, in particular, that Respondent (i) did not hold proper consultations

in the lead to RDL 9/2013, and that to the extent it held formal consultations with respect

to RD 413/2014 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 it did not meaningfully engage
with the industry participants; ! (ii) left investors in the dark for almost a year while it
determined several concepts (standard plant categories, capital investment values and

OPEX payments); '™° (iii) set several criteria behind closed doors (operating hour limits

and criteria for a “well-managed” operator)!’ The industry and the Spanish regulator

itself criticized the lack of transparency in certain parameters of the new regime;!4* and

Respondent refused to disclose documents and technical studies upon which it intended

to base the parameters in Regulatory Framework III (including the BCG and Roland

Berger Reports). !°°

Claimants also (i) deny that Spain gave prior notice of the changes it implemented in
2013 since the general election in November 2011 or with the CNE Report of 7 March
2012; (ii) argue that even the initial measures in 2012 did not reveal the magnitude of the

b. Respondent’s Position
(i) No Failure to Provide a Stable and Consistent Framework

Stability. Respondent denies that it has breached any obligation to provide a stable legal
framework. According to Spain, the challenged measures have maintained the essential
characteristics of the framework under which Claimants made their investment,!°>! and

the regulatory framework for renewable energy has remained stable.!°?

Respondent
maintains that the changes enacted are not arbitrary, disproportionate or abusive, and
were approved to preserve the “reasonable return” mandated by the 1997 Electricity

Law, 053

In particular, Respondent contends that the following key elements are maintained: (i) the
essential principles of the Spanish Electricity System; (ii) the principle of economic
sustainability of the Spanish Electricity System; and (iii) “the specific model of
remuneration to [Renewable Energies] (integration in [the Spanish Electricity System],
perception of market price plus subsidy, subsidy as [...] costs [of the Spanish Electricity
System] and a reasonable return objective).”'°°4 Further, according to Respondent, the
basic principles of priority of access and priority of dispatch are also maintained;!° the
historic methodology to determine reasonable return (involving standard facilities and

common standards) has been maintained; and the new framework continues to guarantee

a reasonable return (the return being better that the discount rate of the sector and of
), 1056

Claimants themselves

Respondent contends that the ECT does not grant investors a right to freezing the

regulatory framework. !°°7

Relying on Plama, Respondent alleges that a “regulatory
framework in itself does not constitute a specific commitment.”!°°8 And relying on AES,
Respondent argues that the provision of the ECT referring to stable conditions is not a
stability clause, as a legal framework is subject to change by definition.'°? Thus,
Respondent contends that “although investors can reasonably and legitimately expect a
host State to provide them with stable conditions for investment,” that “cannot prevent a
host State [...] [from] undertaking regulatory, legitimate and reasonable reforms

imposed by justified circumstances.” °°

Respondent denies Claimants’ characterizations of Regulatory Framework III presented
in support of their allegations of lack of stability.'°°' In particular, Respondent contends

that:

. The investment costs in Regulatory Framework III were based on type of facilities,
as “reasonable return should be based on an analysis of the actual average costs
in the sector adapted to cost-effective and well-managed facilities” given that the
“return must also be reasonable for the consumer” who has a right to an electricity
supply at the “lowest possible cost.” °°

. No reasonable costs are excluded. Since the 2005-2010 Renewable Energy Plan
and RD 661/2007, the concept of “reasonable return” has referred to a “project
financed with independent sources,” and the financial structure of each investor is
an individual and free business decision.!0©

. Investment costs do not refer to the specific costs of each plant, and the alleged
uniqueness of the Termosol Plants relates only to their storage capacity and their
larger solar field, which have been taken into account in the new legislation. !°

. It is erroneous to assert that Regulatory Framework III establishes arbitrary limits
for operational hours and lives of the plants, because the operating hours limits
only concern subsidized hours, but Claimants may continue to produce above the
limit and sell at market price; and the limit on hours had already been outlined
since RD 1614/2010.1°°

. Claimants are wrong in equating the return of 7.398% to a 5.2% after-tax return,
which in truth amounts to 6% after-tax.!0%

. Because the 2005-2010 Renewable Energy Plan and RD 661/2007 refer to the
“reasonable return” of a project funded with independent sources, “the sufficiency
or insufficiency of income received by Plants to meet their credit obligations” is “a
matter removed from the disputed measures.” '°°

. Claimants have not substantiated the allegation that their large capital investments
are virtually worthless; and the PTEs receive between 30-34 million EUR annually
in subsidies. '°*

534. According to Respondent, the ECT standard of stability allows the “adoption of
reasonable and proportionate macroeconomic control measures, provided that they are
motivated by a reasonable cause.” No instability has occurred here, as “the changes
made have been aimed precisely (1) to apply the principle of reasonable return; (2) to
correct situations of over-compensation not covered by this principle; (3) to solve
imbalanced situations with [the Spanish Electricity System], which endangered the
economic sustainability of the same institution and (4) strengthen the stability of the
regulatory framework by raising through a legal rule some aspects previously governed
by a regulation.”'* According to Spain, after the disputed measures, investors still

receive the value of their investment, long-term costs and a reasonable rate of return. 1071

Respondent distinguishes the case law relied upon by Claimants, arguing that it refers to
cases involving concession agreements or licenses expressly limiting reforms in the
agreement. 1072 Moreover, Respondent contends that, even if measured under the standard
of stability in the arbitral doctrine invoked by Claimants, no breach has occurred as: (i)
the legislation was adopted in the exercise of legislative power, with full respect for
established procedures and with the aim of preserving the balance and sustainability of
the system; (ii) no legitimate expectations have been breached since investors should
have known the regulatory framework and how it had been applied in case law;!°7> (iii)
there has been no complete transformation or significant change of the legal

framework. !0

Non-Retroactivity. Respondent denies that the new regime is retroactive, both under
international law, and under Spanish law.'°” It contends that the effects of the disputed
measures “only unfold towards the future, as they have to respect the payments made
prior to the[ir] entry into force.” °°

As to international law, relying on Nations Energy, Respondent contends that a norm
would be retroactive only if it affects “acquired rights,” but not when the rules apply to
future events without affecting existing rights.!°’’ And Claimants, Spain argues, have
never had an “acquired right’ to a fixed remuneration feed-in-tariff system.!°"* Put
another way, according to Respondent, international law allows a rule to apply to
situations originated before the rule came into effect, but only with regard to future
effects.'°”? Respondent also submits that the Charanne tribunal has already ruled that the
measures taken by Spain were not retroactive, holding that “unless there are specific

commitments in place such as those stemming from a contract, there is no principle of

international law preventing a State from adopting regulatory measures with immediate
effect on ongoing situations,” °°

As to domestic law, Spain argues that its Constitutional Court has already ruled that RDL
9/2013 was not retroactive, in judgements of 17 December 2015 and 18 February
2016;'°8! and its Council of State (Consejo de Estado) has also ratified that the legality of
the measures, which apply to the future without affecting acquired rights. !°°?

Respondent argues that Regulatory Framework III applies only to the future and does not

impact subsidies previously paid; and there is no retroactivity in the notion that granted

1083

subsidies are offset with future profit. According to Spain, what the regulator has

done is to establish “a reasonable rate of return in the useful activity of the facility as a

whole,” which “makes it possible to take into consideration the remunerations already

received from the facility commissioning date, for the purpose of calculating the future
subsidies to be received outside of the market, without incurring in retroactivity.”'°*
Moreover, according to Respondent “‘if the subsidies already received in the past were
not taken into account in the calculation of future subsidies, excess remuneration for the
plants could occur, thus distorting the market rules comprising illegal State Aid, with an

infraction of EU Law.” '°8>

And according to Respondent, Claimants were aware that the measures were not
retroactive, as they were advised since 2007, 2008 and 2010 that reforms could be

introduced affecting the remuneration for existing installations. !°°°

Finally, Respondent contends that Claimants have not been able to articulate which

protection in Article 10(1) is breached by the alleged retroactivity.'°°”

(ii) No Failure to Provide a Transparent Framework

Respondent alleges that the Memorial failed to properly articulate the claim for alleged
lack of transparency. °*® That said, Respondent contends that it has acted transparently,
and has not breached the obligation to provide transparent conditions in Article 10(1) of
the ECT. Spain argues that it: “(i) [...] justified and publicised the need for reforms, (ii)
has followed the legally established procedures and ensured participation in the
regulatory process of the holders of legitimate rights (iv) has not incurred contrary
retroactivity into national law (v) has not withheld any information that would affect the

development of reforms and (vi) has approved a regulatory system enabled with
291089

First, according to Respondent, the need for reform of the electricity sector was
announced years before, as reflected in RDL 6/2009, RDL 14/2010 and announcements
of a new Electricity Law made “continuously since December 2011.”'° It was known
to Claimants prior to their investment.'°?' Respondent further highlights that on 7 March

2012, the CNE issued a report referring to the need for reform in the regime."

Second, for Respondent, the development of its laws was transparent, and all stakeholders
had timely access to information and for the submission of comments.'°> For example,
Respondent mentions that the enactment of RD 413/2014 and Ministerial Order
IET/1045/2014 (i) complied with all the formalities required by Spanish law; (ii)
followed several public hearings, and a report from the Council of State among other
entities; (iii) counted with the participation of Protermosolar; (iv) hundreds of claims by

actively via Protermosolar.!°%*

In fact, Respondent argues, some parameters of
Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 were modified in response to allegations made by the
Termosol Plants during the consultation process.!°° Respondent further explains that
Claimants’ complaint that there was no consultation process during the enactment of
RDL 9/2013 overlooks that RDLs are measures of extraordinary and urgent need that do
not allow for a consultation process, and in any event, it was a transitory measure

superseded by Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014.!°°

Third, Respondent contends that there was “[a]bsolute transparency” regarding all

relevant information.'°”

Referring to Claimants’ specific allegations of lack of
transparency with regard to certain reports commissioned by the Government to
determine the parameters of the new regulation by Boston Consulting and Roland Berger,
Spain argues that neither report was crucial in the development of the regulations, nor did
Claimants request them during the process of enactment of the norms.!* Respondent
explains that the Boston Consulting contract was terminated before a report had been
delivered to Spain, and the Roland Berger report was received after the enactment of RD
413/2014 and the Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014. It was not a prerequisite for the
regulation, but rather technical support to IDEA in the analysis of costs of the plants, and
Claimants have had access to it.!° For Respondent, failure to deliver documents that
were not taken into account during the drafting process of the regulation cannot entail a

breach of the ECT.!!

Fifth, Respondent takes issue with Claimants’ allegation that they were in the dark with
respect to certain concepts of the new framework. In particular, Respondent contends
that (i) the new rate of return of 7,398 was indeed proposed by the renewable energy

sector in 2009; (ii) the 10-year bond was considered a good index since the 2007 CNE

the same index;!!°! (iii) the hour reduction was a function of eliminating production with
gas; and (iv) the concept of a well-managed company is inherent in Government

standards for State Aid.!'°?

Finally, Respondent contends that contrary to Claimants’ allegations, the new system
establishes predictable regulatory periods (not discretionary ones) aimed at ensuring a

reasonable return during the regulatory life cycle.!!

(4) Article 10(1) of the ECT: Unreasonable, Disproportionate and
Discriminatory Measures

a. Claimants’ Position

(i) | Spain’s Measures Were Unreasonable, Disproportionate and
Discriminatory

Claimants argue that Regulatory Frameworks II and III do not meet the independent

standards of proportionality and non-discrimination, which “further contributes to a

finding of liability under Article 10(1) of the ECT?”!!4

Unreasonable. Relying on BG Group, Claimants submit that Regulatory Framework III
is “unreasonable” because the unilateral withdrawal of undertakings given to investors as

inducements to invest is, by definition, unreasonable. !!°°

Claimants further argue that although Spain seeks to defend the reasonability and
proportionality of the measures relying on the tariff deficit, the fall in electricity demand
and the notion of overcompensation in the renewable energy sector, it has not
demonstrated the necessary connection between these alleged circumstances and the

dismantling of Regulatory Framework I.'!°° Claimants argue that: (i) the tariff deficit

cannot justify Spain’s actions because there were many other ways open to Spain to
address it;!!°’ (ii) the drop in electricity demand cannot assist Spain because it was
Respondent itself who decided how much electricity capacity it wanted, Spain was on
notice of the drop in electricity demand before it affirmed the timetable for CSP roll out
in RD 1614/2010, and Spain had other means to deal with over-capacity;!!° and (iii) the
allegation that Claimants were overcompensated is unsubstantiated — the IRR expected
by Claimants did not change materially before December 2012 when Law 15/2012 was
introduced, and therefore is not credible to assert that a 36% cut in revenues is

reasonable. '!°

551. Disproportionate. In addition, Claimants argue that, even if Spain had not committed to
stable revenues for the Termosol Plants and regardless of tariff deficit or capacity
difficulties, Regulatory Framework III breached Article 10(1) of the ECT “because it
inflicts a disproportionate level of harm to the Claimants’ investments by virtually wiping
out the value of the Claimants’ equity as a means to extract Spain from a budgetary

L110

shortfall of Spain’s own making. In Claimants’ view, there were less restrictive

alternatives that Respondent could have deployed in pursue of its policies, while still

meeting the ECT. !!"!

552. Claimants contend that Spain’s measures “have reduced the value of the Claimants’
equity in NEE Espana from €397.4 million to €15.5 million and imposed other losses on
NEE Espajia’s loans to the PTEs and the Claimants’ indirect equity interest in NEEOS
(further losses of €4.4 million) as well as lost historical cash flows of €7.3 million

producing a total loss of €393.6 million.”'''? These amounts were later updated by

to be considered a “substantial deprivation” of their investment within the expropriation test under customary
international law, in their view the measure of damages should be the same as Claimants’ case on FET, and
therefore they are not presenting a claim for breach of Article 13 of the ECT. Cl. Mem. Merits, { 279.

Claimants. Thus, in their last expert report, Claimants argued that the reduction in value
of the Claimants’ equity in NEE Espajia was from EUR 450.6 to EU 41.7 million; and
that their total loss was of EUR 521.4 million.'''? They also observe that there has been
a 36% cut to the Termosol Plants revenues, which cannot be considered proportionate. !!!#
Claimants also add that “the return presently given to the Project by the Regulatory
Framework III is insufficient to allow the recovery of the Claimants’ investment” and
they “are now facing a near total loss of their equity investment of €209.6 million.”'!'>
In addition, the PTEs and NEE Espaijia have also suffered severe financial consequences
as a result of Regulatory Framework III, and while the PTEs difficulties have been
alleviated to a certain extent after agreements with the project lenders in August 2016,

Claimants are still facing a “near total loss of their equity.”

For Claimants, severity of effect is a good indication of whether there is an FET
violation, since the FET standard requires States to act proportionately in their dealings
with foreign investors.!!!’ Tribunals have recognized the need for a reasonable relation
of proportionality between the alleged regulatory aim, the means taken to achieve it and

the burden on the investor. !!!8

Spain fails to meet this test, Claimants argue, because there is no rational connection
between the measures and the public purpose that Spain invokes: (i) Spain, not
Claimants, was responsible for accumulating the tariff deficit and the alleged over-
capacity; and (ii) Spain has not demonstrated the rational connection between the

1119

measures and the alleged overcompensation to CSP investors. In addition, the

measures taken are not the least restrictive measure Spain could have deployed to achieve

its stated goals, in Claimants’ view. 120

Discriminatory. Claimants argue that the new regime is discriminatory because it
penalizes high quality and productive plants built in reliance on Regulatory Framework I,
in breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT.!!?! Claimants make clear that this particular one is
not a standalone claim of discrimination under Article 10(7) of the ECT, as it is not based

on MEN treatment or national treatment. !!??

Claimants argue that: (i) “[t]he capacity-based payment system, compounded by Spain’s
application of its ‘standard’ NVA and the new cap on operating hours, discriminates
against the Termosol Plants,” because they were designed to maximize electricity output
on the basis of Regulatory Framework I, and under the new system only a small portion
of the remuneration is based on electricity production;!!?> (ii) “[t]he new ‘regulatory
useful life’ [of 25 years] further discriminates against the Claimants,” as they built their

plants with the intention that they would last 30 years or longer;!!*+

and (iii) “Regulatory
Framework III also discriminates against the Termosol Plants by failing to differentiate
among CSP plants that have very different investment costs and operating expenditures

on the basis of the size of thermal storage.” '!5

Claimants observe that Respondent’s reliance on Article 10(8) of the ECT to argue that
Claimants have not been guaranteed the maximum standard of non-discrimination is
irrelevant, because this claim is being asserted under Article 10(1) of the ECT.!!7°
Claimants also argue that Spain’s response that the measures are of general application
has no merit in law, because it is well established that de facto discrimination entails a

breach of the standard.''?? Finally, Claimants argue that Spain cannot defend arguing

that the Termosol Plants are not penalized since they can produce above the limit and sell
at market price, because such market price is so much lower that it will never permit the

PTEs to recover their sunk costs.!!78

(ii) The Tariff Deficit and Over-Capacity Excuses Fail in Fact and Law

Claimants contend that neither the tariff deficit, nor the overcapacity of the system can
1129

justify Spain’s actions.
Tariff Deficit. Claimants oppose Respondent’s reliance on the tariff deficit, arguing that
such deficit: (i) does not rise to the level of necessity in customary international law, and
has not been invoked as such;!'*° (ii) “arose from Spain’s failure to comply with its own
law and a political decision to prioritise cheap electricity? ''>' (iii) “was known to Spain
at all relevant times prior to the investment” and Spain assured NextEra officials it could
manage it without threat to the stability of the RD 661/2007 regime, such that Spain is
estopped from invoking it;!'°? and (iv) could have been addressed through many

alternative ways while still honouring Spain’s ECT commitments. ''*4

Over-Capacity, Claimants contend that Respondent’s excuses relating to the alleged
over-capacity in the renewable sector are unavailing because: (i) it was Spain (not
Claimants) who determined how much capacity to build; (ii) by nature renewable
technologies require an excess in capacity and in fact, Spain approved more plants than
were built; (iii) the issue is not unique to Spain; (iv) Spain still does not produce more
renewable electricity than it consumes; and (v) Spain has other ways of dealing with any
over-capacity,!!*4

to macro-economic conditions allegedly threatening the sustainability of the system,
Claimants contend that: (i) Spain has not sought to bring its action under the security
interests provision in Article 24 of the ECT, nor has Spain raised a necessity defence
under customary international law, thereby acknowledging that the measures were not the
only way to preserve an essential interest of the State from a grave or imminent peril;!!*>
(ii) even if Spain had raised a necessity defence, it could have never been successful as
the elements in Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility have not been
demonstrated; and (iii) even if it had been demonstrated as of 2013, a state of necessity
would only provide temporary absolution while it lasted, which would no longer be the

case as Spain has experienced three years of growth.!!°°

b. Respondent’s Position

Spain denies that the measures it has adopted were disproportional, excessive, irrational
or discriminatory.!'?’ It highlights that Article 10(8) of the ECT does not guarantee

Claimants the maximum standard of non-discrimination. |!

Reasonability. Respondent argues that the measures were reasonable in light of the
circumstances at the time of their adoption. In particular, Respondent refers to (i) the
drop in the demand for electricity; (ii) the existence of an excess remuneration in the
renewable energy sector; and (iii) the tariff deficit; all of which, according to Respondent,

contributed to making the system unsustainable.!!*

According to Respondent, these
reasons were foreseeable to a diligent investor, and indeed, Claimants were so informed

in a due diligence report in 2008.!!4°

Respondent takes issue with Claimants’ contention that the CSP sector did not contribute
to the tariff deficit, arguing that the Claimants’ theory is deceitful, and based on 2012

figures which are not significant in light of the staggered commissioning of CSP

plants. Moreover, Respondent contends, while Claimants argue that there were other

alternatives to resolve the tariff deficit, they have not established the viability of those

other alternatives, !!

Respondent further opposes Claimants’ contention that estoppel prevents raising the
deficit as a defence, arguing that there was never a promise to Claimants that the deficit

would not affect their remuneration conditions. !!3

Spain further maintains that the disputed measures have been considered reasonable and
attractive by domestic and foreign investors, as shown by the “massive influx of new
investors,” as well as by international authorities such as the European Commission, the

International Monetary Fund and the International Energy Agency.!!4

According to Respondent, the measures were reasonable with the aim of ensuring
investors a “reasonable return.”''4> The reasonableness is shown, Respondent says, by
(i) reference to certain generally accepted criteria, including the opportunity cost, which
was calculated among 6.38% and 6.86% (below the 7.398% granted by the new regime);
(ii) comparison with the profitability of other activities of the same risk level; and (iii)
comparison with the profitability levels given by banks.''#° Moreover, Respondent says,
that 7.398% profitability was that requested by the sector from the Government in
2009.!147

Respondent opposes Claimants’ reliance on the principle of estoppel with respect to the

rate of return, arguing that there is no evidence that Spain promised or guaranteed a

return of 11.6% for thirty years. !!48

Proportionality. Respondent also rejects Claimants’ reliance on the test of
proportionality endorsed by the tribunal in Occidental, arguing that the cases are
distinguishable. In particular, Spain argues that the disputed measures in this case are a
clear exercise of the State’s regulatory power, not comparable to those at issue in

Occidental.''°

Respondent contends that Claimants’ allegations of lack of proportionality overlook that
(i) proportionality is measured by the relation between the need for the measures and the
sacrifice of the investor; (ii) the measures impacted all agents in proportion to their
contribution to the deficit; (iii) the impact is measured with regard to typical plants, not
specific ones; (iv) the IRR of 11% included in the Financial Report for RD 661/2007 was

a maximum return, !!°°

Non-Discrimination. Respondent contends that Claimants have not shown how the new
regime penalizes and discriminates against plants built under Regulatory Framework I.
Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 does consider the special characteristics of Claimants’
plants, including their larger solar park and their greater storage capacity, and are

afforded greater investment costs. !!>!

Referring to the test for discriminatory conduct endorsed by the tribunal in EDF,
Respondent contends that none of those criteria are met in this case. In particular,
Respondent argues that (i) the purpose of the measures was legitimate, aimed at
redressing an imbalance in the system; (ii) the measures fully respected existing
regulations and the case law of the Supreme Court, and they are general in scope; (iii) the
reasons put forward for the adoption of the measures, namely, to guarantee sustainability
of the system, were the reasons behind the measures; (iv) the measures were not taken in

wilful disregard of due process, and indeed followed the legally established procedures

for the enactment of the regulations on the standard of remuneration in the electricity

sector. !!5

In addition, Respondent argues that the disputed measures also meet the standard for
reasonable and non-discriminatory conduct set forth in AES.''? Specifically, Respondent
contends that (i) the measures respond to a rational policy and a public economic
objective — restoring the balance in the system reducing excessive profits by investors
and lessening the burden on Spanish consumers that was playing a key role in the tariff
deficit; !'** (ii) the measures were reasonable in light of the objective of the public policy
sought — they impacted all the actors in the system (consumers, producers,
distributors),''*> and were proportionate as they allow producers to reach a reasonable
return of 7.398% over its investment costs, while restoring the equilibrium vis-a-vis

1156

consumers and the sustainability of the system. In short, for Respondent, the

measures responded to rational policy implemented via a reasonable action. !!°7

Respondent further observes that Claimants’ contention is one for discrimination against
the Termosol Plants, rather than the investor or its investment, and as such it does not fall
under the protection of the ECT.''°* But, in any event, Spain contends, the alleged
discrimination does not exist because (i) there is no evidence of extraordinary
characteristics of the Termosol Plants (with storage capacity and larger solar field being
the only distinguishing factors that resulted in the creation of a specific category for them
in Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014);''°? (ii) there is no evidence that the Termosol

(5) Article 10(1) of the ECT: Breach of Obligations Assumed Towards
Claimants’ Investments

a. Claimants’ Position

In their Memorial on the Merits, Claimants stated that “Spain’s enactment of Law
15/2012, RDL 2/2013, RDL 9/2013, RD 413/2014, and the [Ministerial] Order
[IET/1045/2014], coupled with the application of those measures to the Termosol Plants
and the PTEs, gives rise to a breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT through actions which
[...] breached obligations assumed by Spain towards the Claimants’ investments.”!'°? At
the Hearing, Claimants argued that this statement amounted to a claim under the umbrella
clause of Article 10(1) of the ECT.''%

Respondent protested that no umbrella clause claim has been raised by Claimants in the

course of the proceeding, and emphasized that no such claim was developed in

a. Claimants’ Position

In short, Claimants’ contention is that the TVPEE (i) can be assessed under Article 10(1)
of the ECT because it is an ad valorem levy on gross revenues, not a tax on “income or
capital” within the meaning of Article 21(3) of the ECT; but that (ii) even if it were a tax,
since it is not a tax on income or capital, it can be assessed under Article 10(7) of the
ECT which applies to “Taxation Measures” pursuant to Article 21(3). Article 10(7)
prohibits discriminatory taxation, and the TVPEE discriminates renewable energy
producers in favour of conventional energy producers. In addition, Article 10(7) of the

ECT allows Claimants to import the FET provision from the Spain-Uruguay BIT.''®7

b. Respondent’s Position

In turn, Respondent’s contention is that neither Article 10(1), nor Article 10(7) of the
ECT apply to the TVPEE, because (i) pursuant to Article 21 of the ECT, Article 10(1) of
the ECT does not give rise to obligations with respect to “Taxation Measures,” and the
TVPEE is one; and (ii) pursuant to Article 21(3) of the ECT, Article 10(7) does not apply
to taxes on income or capital, and the TVPEE is a tax on income. Respondent further
denies that Article 10(7) of the ECT can serve to import the FET provisions from another
treaty for purposes of applying that substantive provision to a tax measure.''®® In any
event, Respondent also submits that the TVPEE does not discriminate against foreign
investors in favour of domestic ones, and instead applies to all producers of renewable

and conventional energy.!!?

The Tribunal notes the views of the Parties on the objectives of the ECT and the intended
scope of Article 10. In the view of the Tribunal there is little value in establishing at this
stage an overall view of the objectives of the ECT. Article 10 is a treaty provision and

has to be interpreted in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT. That

interpretative process requires the Tribunal to look at the words used in Article 10 in their
context and in light of the object and purpose of the treaty as a whole. Thus, while the
objectives of the ECT may enter into the interpretative process this does not require an

overall perspective by the Tribunal of the objectives of the ECT.

Article 10(1) is a broad-ranging provision which includes obligations to “encourage and
create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors,” to accord
to investments “fair and equitable treatment,” to provide investments with “the most
constant protection and security,’ not to impair investments “by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures,” and to accord investments treatment that is “no [...] less
91170
Several of these obligations have been raised in this case and the Tribunal will address

each one as appropriate.

(2) Article 10(1) of the ECT: Repudiation of Legitimate and Reasonable
Expectations

Claimants’ primary claim is that Respondent failed to provide fair and equitable

treatment by failing to protect Claimants’ legitimate expectations. The Tribunal accepts

that the protection of legitimate expectations is an essential element of the provision of

fair and equitable treatment and this applies under Article 10 of the ECT.

Their legitimate expectations, Claimants argue, were founded on the terms of Regulatory
Framework I, registration of the Termosol Plants in the Pre-Assignment Registry and in
the RAIPRE, the Ministerial Resolutions of 28 December 2010, and specific statements

or representations made to NextEra by Spanish officials.''7!

The Tribunal is not convinced that in the circumstances of the present case the mere fact
of Regulatory Framework I was a sufficient basis for the expectation that Claimants
would be guaranteed the terms of Regulatory Framework I. The Framework was based
on legislation and legislation can be changed. As Respondent has pointed out, Claimants

should have been aware that changes could be made to the regulatory regime. Thus, on

its own, Regulatory Framework I could not reasonably have been the basis for an
expectation by Claimants that they would be entitled to receive precisely the benefits that

such Regulatory Framework prescribed.

Equally, the Tribunal does not consider that registration in the Pre-Assignment Registry
or in the RAIPRE, while a necessary part of the process for obtaining the benefits of the
regulatory regime, did of itself grant any right to the economic regime set out in RD
661/2007.''!72. As the Charanne tribunal said, “registration with the RAIPRE was a mere
administrative requirement in order to be able to sell energy, and by no means implied

that registered facilities had a vested right to a certain remuneration.” !!7

Nor is the Tribunal persuaded that the Ministerial Resolutions of December 2010
themselves provide a reasonable basis for a legitimate expectation that there was a
guarantee of the terms of Regulatory Framework I. The resolutions reiterate the
applicable terms of Regulatory Framework I. If Regulatory Framework I was not a
guarantee of its terms, then the Ministerial Resolutions could not do what the legislation

to which they applied had not done.

While none of these claims individually constitute a basis for Claimants’ legitimate
expectations claim, they do provide context for that claim. The primary basis for the
claim, however, is that statements and assurances were made directly to NextEra by
Spanish authorities and that these created expectations about the economic regime that
would apply to Claimants in respect of their investment. In other words, the terms of
Regulatory Framework I, and the circumstances surrounding the registration of NextEra’s
investment, provide a context in which the representations and assurances of the Spanish

authorities could be the basis for a legitimate expectations claim.

The statements and assurances on which Claimants rely fall into five categories:

Spain argued that the statements evidenced no commitments on behalf of the Spanish
government and, in many instances they constituted a unilateral understanding of
Claimants that had never been confirmed by the Spanish authorities. Letters written by

Spain were often not initiated by it but were responses to letters from NextEra.

590. In the view of the Tribunal, statements made in writing by Spanish officials constitute the
best evidence of Spanish assurances that could be the basis for legitimate expectations.
The rest are unilateral statements by NextEra officials of their understanding of Spain’s
position. However, although Respondent attempted to cast doubt on the weight that
could be attached to those statements, it never denied that the statements were made even
when the statements were recorded only in NextEra’s own documents or in the witness

statements of Mr. Davidson and Mr. Arechabala. Respondent did not cross-examine

those witnesses on what they said had been told to them by Spanish officials.!'®° As a
result, what NextEra claims to be assurances of Spanish officials was not contradicted by

Respondent and thus can be relied upon by the Tribunal.

What, then, was being assured and what was the scope of the legitimate expectations that
could have been reasonably held by Claimants? As mentioned above, Claimants could
not have had the expectation that the RD 661/2007 regime was frozen and could not be
changed. But the broader question is whether, in light of the assurances that they were
given by Spain, Claimants had a legitimate expectation that the regime would not be
changed in a way that would undermine the security that Claimants had in respect of the

economic regime set out in RD 661/2007.

The assurances on which such an expectation can be based include the letter from
Secretary Marin to Mr. Davidson, which said, “the absolute vocation of said legislation is
to preserve the legal security of all investments currently underway, thereby
guaranteeing the forecasts under which said investments are to be made;”!'*! and the
subsequent letter from Secretary Marin to Mr. Davidson, which said, “the new framework
for the promotion of renewable energies is governed by the principles of judicial and
regulatory stability and visibility, and that the actual pre-assignment in the registry
guarantees the promoter the benefits of the economic regime under which it made its
investment decision.”''®? The Tribunal does not see these as “commitments” by Spain,

but “legitimate expectations” can exist in the absence of actual formal commitments.

The question is whether what was said could reasonably give rise to expectations about
the future conduct of the government. In the present context, the use of terms such as
“guaranteeing” and “preserv[ing] legal security,” in letters from a Spanish minister can
reasonably be taken as statements that the Spanish government had no intention of
making significant changes to the investment regime set out in RD 661/2007 and that this

could be relied on by an investor. That NextEra took these statements, and other

statements reportedly made by Spanish officials, as assurances of the “long-term tariff
and premium stability” they were looking for is evidenced in the witness statements of

Mr. Davidson and Mr. Arechabala.!!*

The process by which RD 1614/2010 came into effect would also have engendered the
expectation that Spain would not unilaterally make changes to the regime without
consultation with the solar energy sector. This process had involved extensive
consultations with industry with amendments being proposed by NextEra among others
and accepted by the Spanish government.'!** This process also would have reinforced
the expectation that Claimants could expect that there would be no radical changes made

to the economic regime based on RD 661/2007 as modified in RD 1614/2010.

Respondent argues that “Jack of due diligence prevents the expectations [...] from being
considered to be real and objective” and that Claimants did not do proper due
diligence.!'®° However, the Tribunal is not convinced that a lack of due diligence has
been established. Claimants had the Poyry consultant reports and Claimants refer to legal
opinions they received on Spanish law. The fact that Claimants refused to waive their
privilege in respect those legal opinions should not lead to any adverse inferences. Non-
disclosure means that Respondent and the Tribunal have not had access to the content of
those opinions, but the fact that Claimants received legal advice is not really contested.
In short, the Tribunal does not consider that the assertion that there was a lack of due

diligence on the part of Claimants has been established.

The Tribunal concludes that on the basis of the assurances given to them by the Spanish
authorities, in the broader context of the specific terms of Regulatory Framework I,
registration in the Pre-assignment Registry and the Ministerial Resolutions of 28
December 2010, Claimants had a legitimate expectation that the regulatory regime in RD
661/2007 would not be changed in a way that would undermine the security and viability

of their investment.

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 237 of 265

The changes made to the economic regime under Regulatory Framework III were
substantial. They included that, the Termosol Plants were now to be paid on the basis of
capacity, not on the basis of the amount of electricity produced; the regulated FiT and the
pool + premium options were abolished; remuneration was no longer payable for the life
of the plants but was limited to a 25-year “regulatory useful life”; indexation of tariffs to
the CPI was abolished; electricity generated through natural gas as a support fuel now
received no payment other than the prevailing market price whereas under RD 661/2007
(confirmed by RD 1614/2010), plants had been entitled to use natural gas as a support
fuel for up to 12% or 15% of their annual production (depending on whether they sold at
a feed-in option or they sold through the pool + premium option); and the market price

remuneration was subject to a new 7% levy on gross revenues.

While individually these changes might not have constituted a denial of fair and equitable
treatment, collectively the economic regime under Regulatory Framework III is
substantially different from that under Regulatory Framework I. As the CNE put it,
Regulatory Framework III “completely changes the remuneration mechanism applicable

to date.” '186

In short, the regime was fundamentally and radically changed. Claimants were deprived
of the security and certainty that, in light of the assurances they had received from
Spanish authorities about guaranteeing the legal security of investments underway as well
as the forecasts under which the investments were made and affirming legal and
regulatory stability, they could have expected. The changes went beyond anything that
might have been reasonably expected by Claimants when they undertook their

investment.

Respondent argues, however, that all that could have been expected by Claimants was a
reasonable return on their investment. In other words, the change from Regulatory
Framework I to Regulatory Framework III was a change on the form of delivery of
benefits, but under both regimes the objective was to deliver a reasonable return and that

is all Claimants could have expected. However, the assurances made by the Spanish

authorities were not about a reasonable return; they were about the regulatory certainty
and stability that NextEra could expect. The denial of legitimate expectations is based on
the failure to provide that certainty and security by changing fundamentally the regime

under which remuneration was to be calculated.

In light of this failure by Respondent to protect Claimants’ legitimate expectations, the
Tribunal concludes that there has been a denial of fair and equitable treatment and hence

a violation of ECT Article 10.

(3) Other Claims

In view of the decision reached by the Tribunal in respect of the above breach of Article
10 of the ECT, in the exercise of judicial economy the Tribunal considers it unnecessary
to consider the additional arguments of Claimants regarding the breach of Article 10(1)
of the ECT, namely: the failure to provide a stable, consistent and transparent framework;
unreasonable, disproportionate and discriminatory measures; and the breach of
obligations assumed towards the Claimants’ investments. It equally finds it unnecessary
to consider Claimants’ arguments regarding the breach of Articles 10(1) and 10(7) due to
the TVPEE in Law 15/2012. The TVPEE has been dealt with already in the jurisdictional
findings.

DAMAGES

THE PARTIES POSITIONS
(1) ~— Claimants’ Position

a. Standard of Compensation
Claimants assert that due to Spain’s breach of Article 10 of the ECT, they are entitled to
full reparation or restitutio in integrum, as the standard has been articulated by the
Permanent Court of International Justice’s Judgment in Chrozow Factory and embodied
in Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, and affirmed by arbitral

tribunals.''8’ Full reparation can be achieved either through restitution or, if restitution is

impossible or imposes a disproportionate burden on the State, the payment of

compensation; 1188

and compensation should cover all financially assessable damages
caused by the wrongful act, including lost profits according to Article 36 of the ILC
Articles on State Responsibility.!'®? Furthermore, full reparation requires comparing the
situation of the injured party in a scenario absent the wrongful act and the actual situation
of that party as a result of the wrongful act.!'°° Claimants submit that, as Article 10(1) of
the ECT does not prescribe a treaty standard for reparation, customary international law

applies to the quantification of damages.!!?!

b. Method of Valuation

Arguing that Spain has “not made reparation by reapplying Regulatory Framework I to
the Claimants’ investments and compensating the Claimants for any damages not
covered through restitution,” Claimants plead their case as one for compensation.!!°?
The requested compensation has been calculated, Claimants argue, by “compar{ing] the
current value of the Claimants’ investment under Regulatory Framework III against the
but-for value of those investments under Regulatory Framework I, together with
historical losses prior to the valuation date (taken as the date of the Tribunal’s

award).?""%3

Claimants initially chose a valuation date of 30 June 2014, this being the
date of the last audited accounts of the PTEs.'!°* The calculations were later updated as
of 30 June 2016.''% In the alternative, Claimants have also argued that, should the
Tribunal decide to assess damages as of the date of injury, 30 June 2014 would be the
appropriate date, as the last of the “cumulative measures” giving rise to Spain’s liability

(Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014) was enacted on 20 June 2014.!!°°

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 240 of 265

Claimants’ view, however, is that the date of award is the more reliable touchstone
because it takes into account the latest information on PTEs revenues, free cash flows to

NEE Espaiia and the impact of debt restructuring.!!°”

Claimants contend that international tribunals have regularly adopted the fair market
value (“FMV”) standard for breaches of FET and, in this case, the most appropriate way
to determine the FMV is through the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method.''® This
requires, Claimants argue, “project[ing] the future cash flows that an asset would have
generated for equity-holders in the absence of the alleged wrongful government conduct,
and then discount{ing] them back to the valuation date at a rate that accounts for the risk
associated with those cash flows.”''* Claimants’ experts applied the free cash flows to
equity approach which allows the Tribunal to assess the equity value of a company

directly, and thus argue that the discount rate applicable is the cost of equity. !7°°

Claimants submit that the DCF method has been widely endorsed by arbitral tribunals in
determining compensation both for expropriation and other international law

breaches. !°!

It is also “the most appropriate method in this case” because: (i) “[...] a
forward looking valuation is more appropriate to investments which stem from the
anticipated future cash flows;” (ii) “is based on fundamental principles of economics and
finance;” (iii) “is one of the most generally accepted and used techniques [...];” and (iv)
“is particularly suited to valuing companies whose projected revenues are defined by law
or regulation, because their future cash flows are less volatile and more predictable than

those of an unregulated business.” !?°>

Claimants further submit that DCF is appropriate here because: (i) the CSP technology
used in the Termosol Plants has been successfully in operation for decades, the Termosol

Plants are the most mature of the four categories of CSP plants, and their technology is

commercially proven;!°? (ii) there is a track record of experience in operating and
maintaining plants similar to the Termosol Plants, as the technology used in the Termosol
Plants had already been used in 9 projects in Spain, and a number of projects with that
technology have been in operation for 8 years and more are being built and
developed; !? (iii) there is no uncertainty in the revenue and cost projection calculations,
as shown by the fact that the projections were assessed and regarded as credible in the
financial model agreed between Claimants and their project lenders (the “Bank
Model”); '?° and there is little risk in the revenue projections given that RD 661/2007
provided “a predictable tariff adjusted by an inflation factor.”'°’ In addition, the
projected costs are predictable, Claimants argue, as the historic costs are sunk and known,
and many of the operational costs are the subject of long-term agreements, and the

financing costs are known.!2°7

Claimants further contend that it is no answer to state that the Termosol Plants had been
operational for only one year as of 30 June 2014, given that the task is to perform a
valuation as of the date of the award, and as of 30 June 2016 there were already two
further years of actual operation data, which is closely in line with the Bank Model and

underscores the reliability of those projections. !7°

c. Damages Valuation

Claimants explain that their expert’s valuation (i) assumes a 30-year operational life for
the Termosol Plants;!?® (ii) calculates but-for-revenues based on the pool + premium
option under Regulatory Framework I, as this would have been the logical operating
choice for the PTEs;'!° (iii) forecasts the electricity generation of the Termosol Plants

actual loans made to the PTEs;'!? (v) determines operating expenses based on the Bank

Model. !?13

As to the discount rate, Claimants use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”), which
in their view is a standard method in the industry.!2!+ Based on this method, Claimants’
experts “assess a cost of equity for the Claimants’ investments in Spain of 7.62% and a

cost of debt of 5.79% pre-tax (which translates to a rate of 4.05% post-tax).”!?'>

On this basis, the Memorial on the Merits asserted total losses of EUR 393.6 million as

Claimants’ primary case, composed as follows: !7!®

. “The value of the Claimants’ equity in NEE Espana (reflecting their indirect 100%
ownership of the PTEs and the PTEs’ shareholding in the EVC grid connection
joint venture), has fallen from €397.4 million to €15.5 million (a loss of €381.9
million).”

. “The value of the Claimants’ interest in the loans from NEE Espana to the PTEs
has fallen from €19.6 million to €15.7 million (a loss of €3.9 million).”

. “The Claimants’ indirect 100% equity stake in NEEOS has fallen from €6.3 million
to €5.8 million (a loss of €0.5 million).”

. “Lost historical cash flows to 30 June 2014 of €7.3 million.”

In their updated calculation as of 30 June 2016, presented with Claimants’ Reply on the
Merits, Claimants’ experts “assess damages [...] at €503.5 million as of 30 June 2016,
comprised of €60.4 million in historical cash flow damages from the implementation of
the Measures up to 30 June 2016 and a loss of €443.1 million in the fair market value of

While reiterating that its primary case is based on a present day (“date of award”)
valuation, because the date of award is a more reliable date, Claimants also submit that if
the Tribunal were to be minded to adopt the approach of other tribunals “by excluding
historical losses during the period up to 30 June 2014, this would reduce the Claimants’

alternative but-for scenario would apply “in the event that the Tribunal were to conclude
that Spain was lawfully entitled to terminate Regulatory Framework I and to replace it
with a tariff regime as set up by Regulatory Framework III.”!?3' Claimants have further
explained that in this scenario, their experts have assumed that Regulatory Framework IIT

allowed rate of return. !?°5

claimed in the Memorial total losses of EUR 357.6 million, as follows:!22”

. “The value of the Claimants’ equity in NEE Espana (reflecting their indirect 100%
ownership of the PTEs, and the PTEs’ shareholding in the EVC grid connection
joint venture), has fallen from €357.6 million to €15.5 million (a loss of €342.1
million).”

. “The value of the Claimants’ interest in the loans from NEE Espana to the PTEs
has fallen from €19.6 million to €15.7 million (a loss of €3.9 million).”

. “The value of the Claimants’ indirect 100% equity stake in NEEOS is unchanged.”
. “Lost historical cash flows to 30 June 2014 of €11.5 million.”

With the Reply on the Merits, Claimants “updated the alternative damages case as of 30
June 2016,” and argued that “damages payable to the Claimants are €398.4 million,
comprised of €63.8 million in historical cash flow damages from the implementation of
the Measures up to 30 June 2016 and a loss of €334.6 million in the fair market value of

the Claimants’ equity investments on that date.” '??

valuation, Respondent has not challenged a number of valuation parameters. Thus,
Claimants argue that (i) Spain “does not dispute that the net effect of the regulatory
changes at issue in this case is a 36% reduction in the annual revenues that the PTEs
expected;” (ii) there is no substantial dispute over the fact that “the Claimants injected
€210 million in equity into NEE Espajfia and this is worth significantly less now,” with
Claimants’ experts valuing that equity stake as of 30 June 2016 at EUR 44 million, and
Spain’s experts implicitly conceding that, as of 30 June 2016, the value of Claimants’

equity stake under the new framework has at least fallen between EUR 64.2 and 80.1

million.!23!

Claimants further submit that Spain’s objections to the specifics of Claimants’ DCF

calculations are unavailing.'?* In particular, Claimants submit that:

It is incorrect to calculate the “but for” FMV of the Termosol Plants based on what
Regulatory Framework III deems to be Claimants’ investment costs.'7° The
valuation of an asset derives from its capacity to generate cash flow, not from
historic cost.!7*4

Spain’s assertion that Claimants’ DCF calculations imply a disproportionate IRR
of 36.6% as compared to the 16.6% equity IRR expected at the time of investment
is misleading. !?*° The 16.6% IRR in the Bank Model is the return from “building
and operating the Plants for their entire useful life — in other words, from 2008-
2043,”'° while the 36.6% IRR covers a much shorter time span (2009 to
2014). 1237

It is incorrect to assert that the claim is speculative because the implicit IRR in
Claimants’ DCF model exceeds the industry Weighted Average Cost of Capital
(WACC”).!238. The comparison is not appropriate, and in any event, the IRR can
exceed the WACC,'?? because RD 661/2007 “was specifically designed to
provide an investment return higher than the industry WACC in order to induce
large scale investments in solar energy projects on an accelerated basis.”!?*°
Furthermore, a fundamental thesis of prudent investments is to choose projects in
which the investor expects a profit, i.e. a rate of return higher than the cost of
capital.'24!

Similarly, Claimants dismiss Spain’s objections to the calculation of the alternative but-

for scenario, arguing that:

Claimants’ actual sunken costs (EUR 720.6 million), not Spain’s hypothetical
“efficient and standard” project costs (EUR 644.0 million), are the proper
foundation for calculating a reasonable return.'?4?_ Claimants argue that (i)

actual historical costs; !74 (ii) this is apposite when the “rate of return” regime is
applied retroactively after an investor has already incurred costs;!*+ (iii) Spain’s
selection of EUR 644 million as investment costs is flawed because it disallows
several elements, in particular, EUR 72.3 million in financing costs incurred
during construction. '!4°

. The WACC plus 300 bps is the uniform method of determining a reasonable return
(not the sovereign bond yield plus 300 bps argued by Spain).'4° Claimants
contend that (i) their approach is endorsed by common regulatory practice in 20
European countries; !4” (ii) 300 basis point premium over WACC is appropriate,
and Spain’s argument that an investor would have invested only receiving a return
of the WACC is contrary to academic theory, the historical context of the solar
energy initiative to attract investment, business common sense and witness
evidence. '*48 Claimants contend that the CNE analyzed the FiT and pool +
premium tariffs at the WACC plus 300 bps as the appropriate IRR to incentivize
deployment of funds, plus 160 bps to compensate exposure to wholesale spot
prices. !74°

. The rate of return proposed by Spain is unreasonable because (i) it is lower than
the cost of capital for similar solar thermal projects as of the time of Regulatory
Framework III; (ii) it is lower than the investor’s expectations at the time of
closing of Claimants’ investment (11.6% post-tax); and (iii) it is lower than the
rate of return the CNE was expecting (10% for FiT, and 11.6% for the premium
tariff).

623. Claimants also argue that Spain’s application of the DCF method in its subsidiary
calculations for assessing damages is flawed. For Claimants, Spain’s calculations applied

a wrong discount rate, made incorrect adjustments to the projection parameters and

applied a liquidity discount without basis. !75!

d. Impact of the TVPEE

Claimants contend that “neither side’s quantum experts attributed any specific loss in
future revenues to the TVPEE.”'?>> According to Claimants, “the effect of declining
jurisdiction over the TVPEE” is that “it would reduce their historical damages by €1.1
million (which is the loss resulting from the application of the levy from the dates that the
Termosol Plants started operation (19 May 2013 and 7 June 2013) until 9 July 2013,
when Regulatory Framework III took effect).” >> Claimants argue that this quantification
has not been challenged.'?*4 Therefore, Claimants submit that, since they have quantified
damages applying the DCF methodology at EUR 521.4 million as of 30 June 2016, which
includes lost historical cash flows as of that date (EUR 60.4 million), if the Tribunal rules
that it has no jurisdiction over the TVPEE “the historical loss component for the period
up to 20 June 2014 during the temporary application of Regulatory Framework IT would
be reduced by €1.1 million, resulting in total damages of €520.3 million as of 30 June
2016." 1255

Claimants add, however, that if the Tribunal were to conclude “that the Claimants could
only expect a ‘reasonable return,’ there would be no need to make any adjustments for
the TVPEE,” because this “alternative applies Regulatory Framework III but uses the
independently-audited capitalised investment costs of the Termosol Plants and the return
of WACC + 300 bps identified as reasonable by Spain under Regulatory Framework
1”'256 Thus, “in that alternative but-for, the TVPEE is reimbursed on all electricity
revenues in accordance with the principle enshrined in Ministerial Order

TET/1045/2014.”'?57

e. Interest

Claimants assert interest is an integral component of full compensation under customary
international law.'?°* According to Claimants, if the Tribunal applies the principle of full
reparation as of the date of the award, including historical losses, pre-award interest
would not be necessary. However, if the Tribunal decides to apply a valuation date prior
to the date of the award, pre-award interest would be owed from that date onwards until
the date of the award.'2°? In addition, Claimants submit, they are entitled to post-award
interest from the date of the award until the date of payment, “at a commercial rate
established on a market basis.”!?® According to Claimants, while this is mentioned in
the ECT in the context of expropriation, “there is no logical reason for applying a

different approach to interest in respect of a breach of Art. 10(1) of the ECT.”'?°!

Claimants submit that it would be appropriate to award a “rate reflecting the cost of
equity applicable to the underlying investment,” on the ground that this compensates the

1262

cost of raising the equity funds of which they have been deprive In particular,

Claimants initially requested an interest rate of 7.62% in the Memorial on the Merits,!7°
and later in the Reply on the Merits requested a rate of 6.84% as of 30 June 2016. In
the alternative, Claimants request interest at “commercial interest rate prevailing in Spain
for credit risk similar to the Termosol projects,” such as the interest rate of EURIBOR +
3.5% prescribed in the credit agreement negotiated between the PTEs and their project

lenders.!?® Claimants further submit that interest should be compounded. !7°

Claimants dismiss Spain’s approach to the subject of interest rates, arguing that it does
not provide “any convincing substantiation,” and argues that using a rate equivalent to

the cost of equity ensures full reparation. '?°7

(2) — Respondent’s Position

Spain’s primary contention is that, as there has been no violation, no damages are due.'?°*

That said, Spain also opposes Claimants’ damages case, arguing that: (i) it is speculative;
(ii) the DCF method is inappropriate in this case; (iii) the arguments on the alternative

case are inaccurate; and (iii) the requested interest rates are not correct.!7°°

a. Method of Valuation

Respondent argues that the DCF method is inappropriate in the circumstances of this
case,!?” because: (i) there is insufficient financial record (less that one year); (ii) this is a
capital intensive business with a significant asset base, with no relevant intangibles to be
valued; (iii) the solar thermal industry lacks maturity; (iv) cash flows are highly
dependent on volatile and unpredictable elements such as the pool price; (v) weakness of
the non-recourse project finance agreed; (vi) the long term for the forecast: 30 years; (vii)
there is a contradiction between such timespan, and the average life cycle of the
Termosol Plants in their official accounting (20-25 years); (viii) there is disproportion
between the track record of one year and the forecasts to 30 years; (ix) there is

disproportion between the alleged investment and the amount claimed. !?7!
According to Spain, the appropriate method would be one based on cost of the asset. !?7

b. Damages Valuation

arbitrary valuation date of 30 June 2014, ignores the basic concepts of the regulatory life

cycles, and overlooks the “joint consideration of past and potential cash flows to

1274

guarantee a reasonable return of the investments made. Furthermore, the

comparison between the real and counterfactual scenarios is simplistic, hypothetical and
unrealistic, as it “presume[s] that the ‘real’ scenario will be maintained over forthcoming
decades and overlook{s] the fact that the governing principle of the system is formed by

1275

the guaranteed reasonable return. The calculation is speculative, Respondent

argues, due to its long time horizon and the fact that there is no guarantee that the

remuneration will remain petrified in the current form. !7”°

Respondent further submits that the but-for valuation is exaggerated if compared to the

1277

book value; and the implicit IRR in Claimants’ valuation is an unjustifiable 36.6%,

when compared to the 16.6% foreseen at the time of investment, and the 7.62% discount

rate calculated by Claimants’ expert.!278

Respondent further criticizes Claimants’ valuation, arguing that “[t]here is a large
disparity (+84.7%) between the Plant’s value in Lexecon’s But For (€1.1625 billion) and
the value of investment (€629.3 million)” which given the “barely 3 years of operations
cannot be justified by economic motives that are intrinsic to the business.”'7”? Moreover,
for Respondent, the shareholder’s exit IRR of 30.4%, and the project’s exit IRR of 16.5%
“are extraordinarily high and therefore unimaginable in a regulated market that provides

1280

protection to the players. In addition, Respondent argues that Claimants’

calculations include a series of payments as “investment or operating costs when they are

actually, [...] either dividends disguised as management fees paid to the NextEra group

or ‘promote or success fees’ outside the market paid to linked entities.”'7*!

Respondent also contends that Claimants’ alternative but-for scenario errs in various
ways: (i) it replaces the appropriate investment basis (standard investment costs of
standard facilities) with the costs declared by Claimants; (ii) it fixes a rate of return ad
eternum, overlooking the dynamic nature of the notion of “reasonable return;” (iii) it
calculates reasonable return unjustifiably adding 300 bps to the WACC; and (iv) it errs in
calculating the post-tax WACC, as it applies the nominal tax rate to its pre-tax
WACC.'?* According to Respondent, the applicable effective rate of return of 7.398%
(pre-tax) guaranteed by the current regime, leads to a reasonable return of 6.5% to 6.9%

post-tax.!?83

Lastly, while objecting to the use of the DCF, Spain presents its own DCF calculation as
a “subsidiary contention.” In the initial calculations presented with the Counter-
Memorial on the Merits, Respondent argued that the results ranged from an increase of
EUR 19.3 million in Claimants’ investment (a positive impact on Claimants) to a

negative impact on Claimants’ investment of EUR 34.5 million.!7**

In the updated
calculation filed with the Rejoinder on the Merits, Respondent reiterated that the current
regime is more beneficial in purely financial terms, arguing that the impact of the dispute

measures is a positive impact of EUR 32.5 million. !7*5

Respondent further submits that Claimants have erroneously applied the premium of
Article 36 of RD 661/2007, which only “applies to facilities of no more than 50 MW,”
while the Termosol Plants “have more than 50 MW” and are thus under the “lower

premium of Article 45 [...].”'?8° But according to Spain, even applying the regime in

Article 36 of RD 661/2007, the results would remain significantly below Claimants’
calculations. Respondent’s expert calculated the impact in this scenario as a negative

impact of EUR 23.1 million.!°”

Respondent also takes issue with other parameters in Claimants’ valuation, arguing that:
(i) the appropriate life cycle of the plants is 25 years and not 30 years; !78° and (ii) the

but-for-scenario would involve a higher risk than the actual scenario. !?°°

Tt goes on to
submit that, “in purely financial terms, the current scheme might be more beneficial to
the Claimants than RD 661/2007, depending on the parameters and hypothesis

. vol
considered.”

Finally, referring to the issue of the impact of the date of valuation, Respondent submits
that the question has a great effect on quantum, and argues that it cannot accept a date of

award valuation. '?!

Respondent further opposes Claimants’ allegation that if the
Tribunal were to adopt the approach of other tribunals “by excluding historical losses
during the period up to 30 June 2014” the effect would be a reduction in Claimants’
claim of EUR 7.3 million.!”°? Respondent contends that the expert reports simply do not

address the separate impact of the individual disputed measures. '?°?

c. Impact of the TVPEE

With regard to the effect of the TVPEE on damages calculations, Respondent submits
that to eliminate the TVPEE’s impact is not enough to eliminate the “historical
damages.” '?°* Moreover, for Respondent, “even though in the Actual world the TVPEE

tax is neutralized (as recognized by both parties), [...] for damages calculation, it must

view, however, neither Party’s experts reports reflect the separate impact of the
individual measures, and new expert reports would be required if that impact needs to be

assessed, !?°°

d. Interest

641. For Spain, the interest rates proposed by Claimants lack grounds and are intended to

compensate risks never effectible borne.!7°”

According to Spain, at most, the applicable
rate should be “equivalent to the Spanish sovereign bond,’'?°* which according to
Respondent’s experts would be a rate of 0.9%.'? For pre-award interest, Spain further
submits that, instead of a 10-year bond, Respondent’s experts have applied an interest
equivalent to the bond for the period between the appraisal date and the estimated date of

award. For Spain, the same criteria must apply to post-award interest. !3°°

B. TRIBUNAL ANALYSIS

642. While Respondent takes issue with the entitlement of the Claimants to any damages in
this case and disputes the approach of the Claimants to the measurement of damages, it
does not dispute the proposition of the Claimants that the principles set out in the
Chrozow Factory Case and in Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, are
applicable to the measurement of damages. Thus the arguments before the Tribunal

related to the correct way to assess any loss determined by the Tribunal to have occurred.

(1) The DCF Method for Determining Damages

arbitrations and has been applied by tribunals. However, a critical element in the

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 255 of 265

application of the DCF method is finding an appropriate base for the forecast of future
earnings. The difficulty in this case is that the Termosol Plants had been in operation for
less than one year when the breach occurred. As Respondent points out, Claimants were
relying on less than a year of profits in order to project long-term earnings for the next 30

years.

Claimants argue that this is not a problem in this case, because Regulatory Framework I
provides the basis for calculating future profits. The report of Dr. Abdala and Professor
Spiller calculate the “but for’ revenues on the basis of the “pool + premium” option set

out in Regulatory Framework I.!°0!

However, the Tribunal is not convinced that Regulatory Framework I provides an
appropriate basis for what might have happened in the absence of Regulatory Framework
Ill. The assumption that in the absence of Regulatory Framework III Claimants would be
entitled to Regulatory Framework I is based on the view that there was an entitlement to
the terms of Regulatory Framework I. But, as pointed out earlier (supra, {J 591, 596)
Claimants could not have had a legitimate expectation of an entitlement to Regulatory
Framework I; they just had a legitimate expectation that there would not be a substantial

or fundamental change to Regulatory Framework I.

Other changes to Regulatory Framework I might have occurred. For example, if
Respondent had changed the options and abolished the pool + premium approach and
provided only the FiT option leaving everything else intact, that might have been a
legitimate exercise of regulatory authority involving no denial of FET. If that was
possible then why should the pool + premium option be the appropriate basis for the “but

for” analysis in determining loss?!

In the absence of Regulatory Framework I as the touchstone, there is no obvious starting

point for the “but for’ analysis under a DCF approach. What is left is less than one year

of actual profits as the basis for the DCF calculation. In the Tribunal’s view, this is not a

sufficient basis for the application of the DCF method in this case.

(2) An Alternative Basis for a Damages Assessment

Having rejected the DCF method of valuation in the circumstances of this case, the
Tribunal must now find another valuation method. As an alternative approach to the

calculation of loss, Claimants expert, Compass Lexecon has provided an “alternative but-

for scenario” on the basis of a “reasonable rate of return.” This approach was not

dissimilar from the asset-value approach, proposed by Respondent, based on the value of

the assets and a reasonable return.'°"*

The Tribunal notes that the Parties are not completely in accord on this alternative
method of valuation and they disagree on how it should be applied, each producing

results that are substantially different from each other.

Nonetheless, the Tribunal is of the view that in this case this “alternative” valuation
discussed by the Parties in their pleadings, based on a calculation of the value of the
assets and a reasonable return on that value is an appropriate method for valuation of loss

in this case.

(3) The Quantification of Loss

The disagreement of the Parties on quantification relates to the valuation of the assets,
whether there should be an additional 300 bps added to the WAAC, and how the impact

of taxation should be calculated.

a. Value of Assets

In their initial pleadings both Parties valued assets as of 30 June 2014.'5°° However, in
its second report, Compass Lexecon updated its valuation to 30 June 2016.'°"° Although

it did not raise any objection to the 30 June 2016 valuation date. Accordingly, the

Tribunal will use that date for its analysis.

Claimants derive the value of the assets from their actual value relying on Claimants’
“independently-audited capitalized costs of the project.”'*°' Respondent disagrees with
basing the asset value on costs actually incurred, arguing, “a model of a reasonable
return must in all cases take into account the standard costs of cost effective standard
facilities.” They object to the inclusion of capitalized intercompany costs and
investments in related companies, arguing that there was insufficient information to

justify either. 38

In the Tribunal’s view, Respondent’s argument that the standardized costs of efficient
cost-effective facilities should be the basis for any calculation might be relevant for
devising a regulatory regime based on a reasonable return. The regulatory regime would
then set out what return is being offered and investors could decide whether or not to
invest on the basis of the return they could receive for their investment. But that is not

the situation here.

The task for the Tribunal is to determine what loss Claimants suffered as a result of
Respondent’s breach of its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment. Claimants
did not suffer a notional loss based on the “standard costs of cost effective standard
facilities.” They had actual sunk costs and those costs have to be the basis for assessing

their loss.

The principal difference between the Parties in the valuation of assets is whether
financing costs should be included." Respondent’s expert, Accuracy, argues that
financing costs are not really part of the investment. They are the personal decision of
the investor on its financing scheme and have no implications for the generation of

power.'*!° Claimants see the financing of an investment as an integral part of the

investment. Long-term investments like the Termosol Plants could not occur without

1311

financing arrangements. Moreover, Claimants argue that Spain was well aware that

projects would be funded from third party funding. Its own energy plan for 2005-2010

had a line for financing from external sources. '*!7

The Tribunal considers that Respondent once again is conflating what might be devised
in a regime established to provide a reasonable return with the losses suffered by an
investor in the event of breach of its obligations under the ECT. An investment regime
might be based on the exclusion of financing costs in calculating a reasonable return
under that regime. Indeed Respondent’s expert Accuracy, in criticizing the use by
Claimants’ expert Lexecon of financing costs in its alternative but-for model, says “the
profitability model of a regulated activity must, in any case, be based on efficient,

“1313 That is a reference to

standardized cost and be independent of financing costs.
devising a model for a reasonable return, not in assessing loss resulting from

Respondent’s breach of its obligations towards the investor.

The question before the Tribunal is not how a regulated activity should determine what
constitutes a reasonable return, but what loss the Claimants suffered. On undertaking an
investment an investor would reasonably expect that the returns from the investment
would cover all the costs of making that investment. The examples given by Claimants
where regulatory regimes do include financing costs in determining a reasonable rate of
return reinforce the reasonableness of this expectation.'*!* No rational investor would
sink money into a project that did not offer a return that would cover its costs. And, the
financing of projects of this size and duration inevitably involves a regime with third

party financing.

In its first report Respondent’s expert, Accuracy, also objected to the inclusion in the

Claimants’ valuation of assets capitalized intercompany costs and investment in related

companies. '?!°

In its second report, Accuracy changed its position and included
investment in related companies!*!° following Claimants’ expert Compass Lexecon’s
explanation that the company in question EVC, had been developed by Claimants and the

PTEs “to deliver their electricity production to the Spanish national grid.”'3""7

As far as intercompany costs are concerned, as Compass Lexecon pointed out, these costs
relate to technical, legal and financial services related to the construction of the plants. If
these services were not provided by companies of the NextEra group they would have
had contracted for from outside.'?!® In the Tribunal’s view, these were therefore costs
incurred in the construction of the Termosol Plants and should be included in the

calculation of Claimants’ losses.

Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that financing costs, intercompany costs and
investments in related companies should be included in determining the valuation of
Claimants’ assets. Thus, the Tribunal accepts Claimants’ figure of EUR 720.6 million for
the capitalized costs of the project for the purpose of calculating a reasonable rate of

return.

b. What Constitutes a Reasonable Rate of Return?

The Tribunal notes that the Parties agree that the WACC of the Termosol plants provides
the appropriate basis for determining a reasonable rate of return in an assessment not
based on the DCF method. The difference between them is whether the WACC should
be supplemented by 300bps. Spain had chosen to provide a return under Regulatory
Framework I that was significantly higher than the WACC in order to attract
“accelerated investment in renewables.”'3'9 Claimants’ expert, Compass Lexecon, also

points out that a premium above WACC is common in regulatory regimes in European

jurisdictions.'*?° CNE supported an IRR of WACC plus 300bps when providing advice

on the development of the regulatory regime that became Regulatory Framework I.'37!

Taking account of these considerations, the Tribunal considers that a premium in addition
to the WACC is appropriate in determining the loss that would be suffered under a
reasonable rate of return approach to measuring damages. The question is whether

300bps over the WACC is the appropriate rate.

For the reasons given earlier, the Tribunal considers that Regulatory Framework I is not
the proper basis for determining loss in this case. Thus, the premium that was proposed
for Regulatory Framework I could not be presumed automatically to be the appropriate
premium for this damages calculation. On the information provided to the Tribunal,
there is no consistent practice of fixing the premium at 300bps in European jurisdictions

that provide for a premium when calculating a return on investment in regulated sectors.

In determining the appropriate bps to be added to the WACC, the Tribunal took into in
account the desire to encourage entrants into the Spanish solar energy system as well as
the view expressed by CNE that a premium over WACC was a reasonable expectation of

return.

Taking all of this into account, the Tribunal concludes that the appropriate return on

investment for the calculation of loss should be WACC plus 200bps.

c. The Taxation Issue

The Tribunal notes the difference between the Parties over whether taxation should be
taken into account by converting a post-tax rate of return into a pre-tax rate of return on
the basis of a nominal tax rate of 30%, or whether the rate of conversion should an
effective rate rather than a nominal rate. In considering this, the Tribunal took account of
the fact that the statement of Compass Lexecon that the use of the nominal rate is

“accepted regulatory practice’ was not contradicted by Respondent and noted the

1320 CER-Compass Lexecon Second, 132, Table XVI; Tr. Day 1 (ENG), 136:24-137:6 (Mr. Zimmerman).

difficulty of calculating an “effective rate” for each year if a nominal rate were not to be

used.

The Tribunal concludes, therefore, that the use of a nominal tax rate is appropriate for the
purpose of converting the post-tax rate of return into a pre-tax rate of return in the

circumstances of this case.

d. The Effect of Debt Restructuring

The Tribunal does not consider that the effect of debt restructuring is an appropriate
consideration to include in the valuation of Claimants’ investment. The decision to
restructure the debt and to accept the arrangement that was finally concluded was a
decision of the Claimants. There is no objective way for the Tribunal to determine
whether that was the best arrangement for restructuring the investment or whether
another arrangement might have been made to minimize the impact on the value of the

Claimants’ investment.

Accordingly, the Tribunal has not included the effect of debt restructuring in its

calculation of damages.

e. Interest

The Tribunal accepts that interest is appropriate in this case. However, the ECT makes
no provision for calculating interest in cases of violation of Article 10. In the case of
expropriation, the ECT provides in Article 13, that interest is to be provided “at a
commercial rate established on a market basis.”'*> This is consistent with the purpose
of interest, which is to compensate Claimants for their loss of the opportunity to use their

capital, and is applicable to both pre-judgment and post-judgment periods.

Claimants propose an interest rate of 7.62% based on a calculation of a notional cost of
capital for the purposes of their DCF approach to the determination of damages. In other

words, it is a rate based on certain assumptions, including market and country risk

premiums. !373

It is not based on empirical evidence of what rate could actually be
obtained in the market. Their alternative proposal for interest of EURIBOR + 3.5%, is
based in what the PTEs negotiated with the project lenders. This rate suffers from the

fact that it is Claimants themselves who are effectively setting the rate.

Respondent argues that interest must be based on the rate that would apply in the case of
a risk-free asset, Spanish sovereign bonds, on the basis of the rate that would apply
during the period between date of valuation and the Award. The tribunal in Novenergia
adopted 10-year Spanish sovereign bonds as the appropriate basis for setting the interest
rate.'*4 The tribunal in Eiser stated that in the interest of encouraging early payment of

the award, it set prejudgment interest at 2.07 % and post-judgment interest at 2.50%. !7?°

The Tribunal notes that the only evidence before it of a market rate is the rate of Spanish
sovereign bonds. This may not be a commercial rate, but in the absence of any evidence
of a commercial rate other than what Claimants managed to negotiate with respect to the
project lenders, there is nothing for the Tribunal to go on in setting a rate that can be
described as a market rate. Thus, the Tribunal accepts the rate on 5-year Spanish

sovereign bonds at the date of the Award as the appropriate interest rate in this case.

Claimants argue that interest should be compounded; Respondent makes no specific
submission on this point. The Tribunal accepts that compound interest is commonly

awarded in investment arbitrations and considers it appropriate in this case.

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that the interest rate will be based on 5-year Spanish
sovereign bonds at the date of the Award, compounded monthly. This rate will apply to
pre-judgment interest calculated from the date of valuation, 30 June 2016, to the date of
the Award, and to post-judgment interest from the date of the Award until the date of

payment.

f. Other Issues

The Tribunal notes that since it has based its damages calculation on a valuation of assets
and a reasonable return, the arguments of the Parties relating to damages based on a DCF

calculation are no longer relevant and have not been dealt with in this Decision.

g- Conclusion

The Tribunal has concluded that Claimants are entitled to damages based on a return on
the capitalized value of their assets as of 30 June 2016 on the basis of the WAAC of the
Termosol Plants plus a premium of 200bps. In its Reply on the Merits, Claimants
calculated their loss on the basis of a premium of 300bps. That amount prior to debt

1326

restructuring came to EUR 398.4 million. Since the Tribunal has accepted the

arguments of the Claimants with respect to the valuation of assets and taxation and
rejected its arguments on debt restructuring the amount of EUR 398.4 million has to be
recalculated on the basis of WACC plus 200 bps instead of WACC plus 300 bps.

The Tribunal has also concluded that both pre-judgment and post-judgment interest are to
be awarded on the basis of 5-year Spanish sovereign bonds as at the date of the Award,

compounded monthly.

The Tribunal invites Claimants to recalculate their damages claim of EUR 398.4 million
in the light of a premium of WACC plus 200 bps and advise the Tribunal and Respondent

of this recalculated amount within 10 days of the receipt of this Decision.
