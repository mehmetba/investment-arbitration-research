B. Background of the Dispute

6. The Claimant has commenced these proceedings pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT,
and in accordance with Article 2 of the SCC Rules. The dispute arises out of an
investment said to have been made by the Claimant in the territory of the
Respondent, and the alleged unlawful seizure and expropriation of that investment

by the Respondent in violation of a number of provisions of the ECT.

7. The Claimant argues that the Respondent illegally expropriated two vertically
integrated electric utility companies: Cukurova Elektrik A.S. (“CEAS”) and Kepez
Eletrik T.A.$. (“Kepez”) (together the “Companies”). The Companies were
established respectively in 1952 and 1953. The Respondent initially owned 35% of
the shares in CEAS and 40% of the shares in Kepez. The Claimant argues that he
is currently (i) the direct owner of 8.64%, and indirect owner of 2.7%, of the shares
in CEAS, and (ii) the direct owner of 9.89%, and indirect owner of 6.09%, of the

shares in Kepez.

8. Having operated under various agreements since the 1950s, the Companies were
granted 50-year Concession Agreements which were adopted and executed on
March 9, 1998. The Claimant alleges that the Companies operated normally for a
number of years but that eventually, in the context of intense political rivalry
between the Claimant’s newly established political party (the Geng Party) and the
political party then in power in Turkey, the Respondent government attempted to
seize the assets and the rights of the Companies by enacting discriminatory laws
and carrying out measures that were aimed at dispossessing the Claimant of his
investment. Such actions, the Claimant alleges, included the cancellation of the
Concession Agreements and, the failure of a corrupt court system to properly
remedy the illegal measures, as well as the instituting of state wide legal actions
against the Claimant and his family that bore the sole purpose of harassing and
intimidating the Claimant. The actions in question occurred in or around November

2002, and according to the Claimant continued until at least 2013. The Claimant

SCC Arbitration V 2014/023 — Award on Respondent’s Bifurcated Preliminary Objection

argues that the Respondent has breached a number of provisions of the ECT in this

regard.

The Respondent asserts that the Concession Agreements were terminated for breach
due to the Companies refusal to comply with new laws regarding the transmission
of energy in Turkey. The Respondent further states that the Claimant is a serial
litigator who has brought numerous unsuccessful claims in both local Turkish
courts and before international tribunals, either directly himself or through
companies owned by the Uzan family. The Claimant and his family have been
convicted of a number of frauds and have also received prison sentences relating
thereto. These judicial proceedings constitute part of the Claimant’s allegations of

judicial harassment and intimidation.

The Respondent has made a number of preliminary objections regarding the
jurisdiction and admissibility of the Claimant’s claims, as well as objections
relating to abuse of the arbitral process. In its Award on Security for Costs and
Bifurcation, dated July 20, 2015, the Tribunal granted the Respondent’s request for
bifurcation of its objection as to jurisdiction ratione personae. The Tribunal did not
grant bifurcation of the Respondent’s further preliminary objections, and also

denied the Respondent’s request for security for costs.

Resolution of Procedural Matters

1. Bifurcation

By letter dated September 30, 2014, the Respondent explained that talks regarding
the conduct of the arbitral proceedings had broken down, and the Respondent filed

its Request for Bifurcation.

On October 19, 2014, the Claimant filed its Answer to the Respondent’s Request
for Bifurcation dated October 17, 2014.

Both Parties requested an in person meeting before the Tribunal in order to resolve
preliminary issues relating to bifurcation and the Respondent’s application for
security for costs (the Respondent by letter dated October 2, 2014, and the Claimant
by letter dated October 19, 2014).

Following a telephone conference held on October 20, 2014, by letter dated October
22, 2014, the Tribunal instructed the Parties that it had decided to postpone its
decision with regard to the requests for bifurcation and security for costs. The
Tribunal decided that the Parties should first file their Statement of Claim and

Statement of Defence before the Tribunal can rule on the preliminary issues.

On February 24, 2015, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim and

accompanying exhibits.

On July 2, 2015, the hearing on security for costs and bifurcation was held at Hotel

Wellington, Calle Velazquez 8, 28001, Madrid, Spain.

On July 20, 2015, the Tribunal issued its Award on Security for Costs and
Bifurcation, in which the Tribunal decided to bifurcate a single issue, namely the

Respondent’s preliminary objection relating to ratione personae.

2. Submissions on Ratione Personae, Document Production and Requests

for Interim Measures

On July 29, 2015, the Claimant submitted a request for the production of

documents.

By email dated August 3, 2015, the Tribunal stated that the Respondent must
respond to the document production request, and produce any responsive

documents by August 17, 2015.

On August 17, 2015, the Respondent provided its response to the Claimant’s
document production requests, and separately produced to the Claimant the

documents to which it did not object to the production thereof.

By letter dated August 24, 2015, the Claimant objected to the Respondent’s refusal
to disclose certain documents and requested a number of reliefs from the Tribunal

in this regard.

On September 1, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, accompanied

by the Tribunal’s decision on the Claimant’s document production requests.

On September 22, 2015, the Claimant submitted its Reply on the Preliminary

Objection to Jurisdiction Ratione Personae.

as well as a request for interim measures relating to the forensic examination of

documents.

On October 8, 2015, the Respondent submitted its Observations on the Claimant’s

Second Interim Measures Request.

On October 8, 2015, the Claimant submitted its response to the Respondent’s

Request for Interim Measures.

By email dated October 9, 2015, the Tribunal decided “that neither of the Parties’
requests are sufficiently urgent to warrant the forensic inspection of documents and
exhibits. The Tribunal will, at a later point in time, decide whether it is necessary
for any document or exhibit to be forensically inspected. Ultimately, the Tribunal
will examine all of the relevant circumstances in determining the weight, relevance,

and credibility of the evidence presented before it at the Hearing on Jurisdiction.”

In the same communication dated October 9, 2015, the Tribunal set down a
timetable for the exchange of submissions on the Respondent’s document

production request.

On October 20, 2015, the Claimant submitted its response to the Respondent’s

document production request.

RESPONDENT’S OBJECTION OF RATIONE PERSONAE

The Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the grounds that the
Claimant has not established jurisdiction ratione personae, in accordance with
Articles 26 and 1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT. The Tribunal briefly summarizes the Parties’

respective positions and their voluminous submissions on the issues in dispute.

The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear his case, and that this
has been established in accordance with Articles 26 and 1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT. The
Claimant states that “the issue involves a strictly legal and focused analysis of
Article 1(7)(a)(i) of the Treaty, and rather straightforward related factual

submissions.”?
1. _ Interpretation of the Energy Charter Treaty

The Claimant argues that he qualifies as an “Investor,” as defined in Article
1(7)(a)G) of the ECT and applied in Article 26 of the ECT, thus entitling the
Claimant to avail of the dispute settlement provisions within Part V of the ECT.

Article 1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT provides:

Investor means (a) with respect to a Contracting Party: (i) a natural
person having the citizenship or nationality of or who is permanently

residing in that Contracting Party in accordance with its applicable law.

Article 26(1) of the ECT provides:

Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the
former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former

under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

SCC Arbitration V 2014/023 — Award on Respondent’s Bifurcated Preliminary Objection

58. The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that customary international law
precludes a natural person from bringing a treaty claim against a state of which he
is a national.> However, “even if [it] could be said that such a limitation was
grounded in international law, it would be necessary to establish that the parties’
intent was not to derogate from it by [] consenting to a lex specialis regime.”* The
Claimant argues that the ECT plainly allows a national to bring a claim against his
or her home state and that Turkey, as a Contracting Party to the ECT, has consented
to this. It is submitted that the ECT does not have to explicitly state that a national
may bring an action against their own State, and the Claimant relies in this regard
on the German-Polish Convention concerning Upper Silesia of 1922.° The Claimant

also cites a number of other treaties with similar definitions of investor.”

59. Regardless of the interpretation of customary international law, the Claimant
submits that it is clear from the ordinary meaning of the ECT that nationals are
permitted to bring treaty claims against their home state. The Claimant refers to
Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”), sub-article

1 of which provides:

A Treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the

light of its object and purpose.

60. The Claimant states that “[t]he right for an investor to sue his national State on the
basis of his ‘permanently residing’ in another Contracting Party accords with the
plain meaning of the ECT.”* Relying on the text of Article 1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT,
the Claimant argues that “the use of the term ‘or’... unequivocally shows the

Contracting Parties’ intent to create alternative conditions to satisfy the definition

of an investor under the ECT.”

The Claimant continues that there is no hierarchy
between the alternatives of citizenship, nationality and permanently residing, nor is
the use of these terms cumulative in nature.'? The Claimant argues that “[o]nce the
Investor elects any one of these three alternatives, that choice is exclusive of the
other. Making one dependent on the other would deprive the terms of their effet
utile, and would be in blatant contradiction with the language of Article

Aaa"

61. According to the Claimant, the most “logical and sensible” approach is to
incorporate the definition of “investor” in Article 1(7)(a)(i) into the text of Article
26(1).!? The Claimant contends that Article 26(1) is similarly “straightforward and
the provision should be considered clear on its face.”!? The Claimant argues that
the Respondent has reassembled the word order in inserting Article 1(7)(a)(i) into
Article 26(1) “instead of replacing word for word the defined term ‘Investor’ with
the definition it provides for...”'* The Claimant explains that “the entire point of
having defined terms is precisely to encapsulate within a single word content that
may necessitate more than one award...Here the defined term is ‘Investor’, and by
implication the phrase ‘of another Contracting Party’ should apply to that precise
term and its segmented content.”!>

62. Turning to the object and purpose of the ECT, the Claimant submits that these
confirm the textual interpretation that the Claimant posits. The Claimant states that
“the ECT’s object and purpose is to encourage and create stable conditions,
transparent and favourable to investors and fostering investment in the energy

sector.”'© Professor Leben explains that the ECT is “a large multilateral

agreement...establishing a general system whose overall purpose is different from
the objectives pursued by each of the Contracting Parties. Under these connections
what matters is not so much the criterion of nationality but that of the connection
of an investment to any of the contracting parties even through a weaker connection
than that of nationality, ie. the residence connection.”!’ Thus, the Claimant
submits, there should be no distinction “between permanent residents, according to
whether or not they have the nationality of the State against which they wish to

make a claim.”!®

Should the Tribunal seek to rely on the travaux prépartoire of the ECT, the
Claimant argues that, as provided for in Article 32 of the VCLT, this should only
occur where interpretation according to Article 31 of the VCLT “leaves the meaning
ambiguous or obscure,” or “leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or
unreasonable.”!? The Claimant explains that such an absurd or unreasonable result
would be where there is an “internal contradiction.”?? The Claimant argues that
there is no internal contradiction in this regard. Even turning to the travaux
prépartoires, the Claimant states that this does not “indicate that the treaty drafters
intended that permanently resident persons should be denied access to the dispute
settlement mechanism of Article 26 in a proceeding against a State of their
nationality.”*! Supporting this argument, the Claimant submits that the drafters of
the ECT refrained from including in the treaty text a provision similar to Article
25(2)(a) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between
States and Nationals of Other States (”ICSID”), which excludes persons from suing
their state of nationality. Comparisons are drawn between the wording of the ECT
and Bilateral Investment Treaties entered into by Australia,” which contain clear
language excluding nationals from suing their home state. Mr. Bramberger states

that in the drafting of the ECT “Australia suggested language [to avoid the result

where an investor with nationality of the state they were suing could bring a claim
before the SCC but not under ICSID], but I am unaware that it ever was even
advanced formally, and certainly no such language was ever adopted.” The
Claimant argues that “you cannot find in legal literature, academic studies,
comments on the ECT any statement corresponding to the interpretation of Article
1(7) supported by the Respondent in these proceedings.”** Thus, the Claimant
submits that “[b]y treating nationality and ‘permanently residing’ as two
independent connections, the ECT combines two relationships: that of the legal and
abstract connection between an investor and its national State and that of the

economic connection between an investor and the State in which he resides.”?>

The Claimant submits that The Turkish Foreign Direct Investment Law of 2003
(the “FDI Law”) supports the Claimant’s conclusions regarding the interpretation
of Article 1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT.?° The Claimant argues that “Turkey itself
recognizes the international right for its own nationals residing abroad to pursue
international arbitration against Turkey for violations of their investments in
Turkey. On that basis, Turkey is therefore estopped from disregarding its unilateral
interpretations of the ECT in the FDI Law.””’ Article 2(a)(1) of the FDI Law defines

“Foreign Investor” as:

Real Persons who possess foreign nationality and Turkish nationals

resident abroad.

The Claimant also relies on Article 10 of the Regulation for Implementation of
Foreign Direct Investment Law of August 20, 2003 (the “FDI Regulation”), which

provides:

Turkish Citizens certifying that they are residing abroad with the work or

implementation of the Law.

66. The Claimant stresses that he is not trying to invoke the substantive protections
enshrined in the FDI Law, or for the purposes of jurisdiction.” Rather, the Claimant
seeks to “illuminate the Tribunal on the Respondent’s undertaking of its prior
international commitments, notably its consent to arbitrate disputes with Turkish
nationals permanently residing in another Contracting Party under Article 26 of the
ECT.””? The Claimant relies on Article 31 of the VCLT to show that the FDI Law
was a “subsequent practice” and a “subsequent legislative adjustment to its
international investment treaty regime.”°° Further to its arguments concerning the
interpretation of Article 1(7)(a)(i), the Claimant submits that the FDI Law and FDI
Regulation “qualify as a unilateral act under international law, in the meaning of
the International Law Commission’s [Guiding Principles applicable to unilateral
declarations of States capable of creating legal obligations].”*! The Claimant states
that “[b]y alleging that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae does not cover
claims by its own nationals despite permanently residing in another Contracting
Party, it is contradicting a previous interpretation it gave of the ECT in its domestic
law.”*? The Claimant explains that the FDI Law and the FDI Regulations gave rise
to legitimate expectations on the part of its nationals residing abroad that they would
be granted the benefit of a right of action before a tribunal constituted under the
ECT. In now denying this right of access, the Claimant argues that Turkey has
violated the fair and equitable treatment standard contained at Article 10 of the

ECT.

67. Turning to the meaning of the terms used in Article 1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT, the

Claimant submits that “it is undisputed that the determination of who qualifies as

‘permanently residing in’ for the purposes of Article 1(7)(a)(i) is governed by the
domestic law of the State of residence, and is thus to be effected by the competent
authorities of the State in question.”** The Claimant contends that “[t]his is the basic
tule. This amounts to a legal recognition by the State of a factual assessment
conducted by its competent authorities.”*> The Claimant continues that “[nJot only
is it [the State’s] sovereign right to determine who can reside on its territory, it is
also the only one that has the means and resources to investigate the reality of the
foreigner’s residency.”*° The Claimant explains that Article 1(7)(a)(i) operates “a
renvoi to the Contracting Party’s applicable law, [and that] the ECT grants complete
discretion to each Contracting Party to determine who qualifies as a ‘permanently

residing’ person in accordance with its domestic law.””

In conclusion, the Claimant submits that: (1) “read jointly in accordance with the
general rule of interpretation of treaties, Article 1(7)(a)(i) and Article 26(i) of the
ECT leave no doubt as to the fact that Turkey consented to the arbitration of
disputes under Article 26 in situations where an individual is permanently residing
in another contracting party in accordance with its applicable law, irrespective of
his or her nationality”; and (2) “the determination of who qualifies as ‘permanently
residing in’... for the limited purposes of Article 1(7)(a)(i), is a sovereign
prerogative of the State of residence, is governed by the latter State, and is to be

effected by the competent authorities of that State.”**

2. The Claimant’s Status as an Investor in Accordance with Article

1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT

The Claimant submits that he meets the criteria enunciated in Article 1(7)(a)(i) at

all relevant times in order to qualify as an Investor thereunder.

(a) The Relevant Dates

70. In making its submissions regarding the dates for the Tribunal to consider, the

Claimant relies heavily on a passage from Procedural Order No. 4, which provides:

“The Tribunal considers that what the Claimant has to prove at this stage
of the proceedings concern the determination of elements relating to
jurisdiction ratione personae on the alleged relevant dates, rather than the
dates or period of time on which the alleged breaches occurred. The
alleged illegal acts and particular dates on which they occurred are
matters for the merits that will be dealt with by the Tribunal, if necessary

and as appropriate in due course.”??

71. The Claimant submits that “the only relevant date in order for the Tribunal to
determine its jurisdiction ratione personae should be the date of the Request For
Arbitration.”“° However, the Claimant maintains that he has satisfied the

jurisdictional criteria even if the Tribunal relies on other potentially relevant dates.

72. The Claimant notes that the ECT does not make explicit reference to the moment
in time at which the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is to be established.*! The Claimant
turns to the object and purpose of the ECT and states that determining the
procedural capacity to bring the claim “is equivalent to assessing whether he has
jus standi...[and] [b]ecause jus standi is evaluated at the time a claimant consents
to arbitration, this means that the time at which the Tribunal must determine
whether it has jurisdiction ratione personae is the time when the Investor consented
to arbitration: that is, the filing of the request for arbitration.”*? The Claimant argues
that to include the date of breach, or breaches, would “add[] to the requirement for
jurisdiction ratione personae a date that is in reality only relevant to the

determination of jurisdiction ratione materiae.”** The Claimant filed his Request

for Arbitration on March 7, 2014. The Claimant maintains that this is the only

relevant date for determining jurisdiction ratione personae.

Concerning the dates of the alleged breaches, the Claimant posits that he “holds
dominion over the alleged relevant dates, which at this stage cannot disputed by the
Respondent.”* The Claimant argues that 2013 and 2014 are the relevant dates of
the constitution of the breaches because of their composite nature under Article 10
and Article 13 of the ECT. The Claimant alleges that the Respondent forced CEAS
and Kepez to first “transfer their commission rights against their will in November
2002,” followed by a number of further actions, and “finally deciding to officially
transfer the production (generation) assets from the companies to EUAS in 2013,”
and that this amounted to an incremental expropriation.** The Claimant refers to
further dates in 2014 and 2015 formally effectuating the transfer of the assets from

the Claimant.

Relevant to determining the dates of the alleged breaches, the Claimant submits that
the Respondent’s alleged breaches of the ECT are composite acts under
international law. The Claimant explains that a composite act arises from “a series
of behaviour, acts, or omissions, legal or illegal when taken independently, but
when taken together constitute a breach of an international obligation.”*” Article 15
of the International Law Commission Draft Articles on State Responsibility

provides:

(1) The breach of an international obligation by a State through a
series of actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful
occurs when the action or omission occurs which, taken with the
other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful

act.

77.

(2) In such a case, the breach extends over the entire period starting
with the first of the actions or omissions of the series and lasts for
as long as these actions or omissions are repeated and remain not

in conformity with the international obligation.

The Claimant argues that “the illicit measures taken together constitute composite
acts under international law, which extend from November 2002 up until at least

2013.48

Regardless of whether or not the alleged breaches amount to a composite act, the
Claimant submits that the breach of Article 13 of the ECT has been continuous.*”
The Claimant states that “[a] continuous breach is a breach that takes place until the
State puts an end to it by executing its primary obligation, source of the breach.”>”
The Claimant continues that “[t]ribunals have affirmed that continuous breaches
fall within the jurisdiction ratione temporis of a tribunal, by extending it to breaches
that are the continuation of conduct that occurred before the entry into force of the

treaty (or the jurisdictional provision).”>!

The Claimant relies on the European Court of Human Rights decision in Loizidou
v. Turkey and summarises the case as holding that “if direct expropriation is to be
considered as an immediate act with a continuous effect, any deprivation of access,
use and enjoyment of property does indeed constitute a continuous act.”°? In
response to the Respondent’s argument that Loizidou is no longer good law, the
Claimant submits that “if Loizidou is good law, then the Claimant’s argument for
continuing violation will hold and the Respondent’s objection must be dismissed.”°*

The Claimant argues that Loizidou is good law because, among other reasons,

Turkey has paid the damages rendered in that case, and a remedy has been

established by the Respondent in order to pay compensation in “Loizidou clones.”>+

78. Summarising the factual allegations in light of the legal reasoning that the Claimant
puts forth, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s “measures incrementally
disrupted the functioning of CEAS and Kepez and they crippled their value. These
progressive measures culminated when the Respondent took the decision to have
all the assets, and mainly the dams, transferred from the accounting sheets of CEAS
and Kepez, to those of EUAS in 2013 and 2014.” The Claimant continues that
“{a]ll of the [] measures put together were equivalent to an expropriation, and in
actual fact, amount to a creeping expropriation... .[I]t took place through a series of
actions whose aggregate effect was to destroy the value of the investment and

effectively negate the Claimant’s interest therein.”*°

(b) Claimant’s Residence in the United Kingdom

79. In making his submissions regarding his stay of residency in the United Kingdom,
the Claimant repeats his argument that “[i]t is not for this Tribunal to second-guess
these determinations [of the Home Office], whether in application of what the
Tribunal believes to be the applicable law, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction,
or on the basis of any other standard or criteria.”*’ The Claimant submits that the
United Kingdom Home Office, which is responsible for border control and
considering applications to stay and enter in the United Kingdom, has made three
determinations as to the Claimant’s status. The Claimant notes that he first applied
for “Leave to Remain” in 1996, pursuant to Section 224 of the UK Immigration
Rules. The Claimant draws attention to part (iii) of Section 224, which provides
that the person “intends to make the United Kingdom his main home.” Turning to
Section 227 of the UK Immigration Rules, the Claimant highlights part (iv) which
again refers to the person’s “main home.” The Claimant argues that “these

provisions all accord on the requirement that any extension of stay must bring the

54 Id.,p.72.

56 Id., pp. 75-76.
511d.,p. 49.

21
SCC Arbitration V 2014/023 — Award on Respondent’s Bifurcated Preliminary Objection

proof to the Secretary of State (Home Office now) that the applicant had made his
main home in the United Kingdom.”** The Claimant further explains that a similar
threshold is contained in Section 230 and Section 231, concerning “Indefinite leave
to remain,” which reverts back to Section 227 in incorporating the “main home”

requirement.*?

80. Detailing how the Claimant’s factual circumstances connect with these legal
definitions, the Claimant recounts that he was granted “Leave to Remain” in the
United Kingdom on September 5, 1996, which was extended on August 31, 1997,
and thereafter renewed annually. Then, on November 10, 2000, the Claimant was
granted “Indefinite Leave to Remain.” The Claimant argues that the granting of
these statuses to him, “as well as by the administrative decisions of each border
officer checking his papers when he entered the UK, once he was the beneficiary
of the indefinite leave, the Home Office has concluded...that Mr. Uzan has made
the UK his main home, i.e. not only he has the entitlement to reside permanently
there, but also that at that time he was so residing, as the concept of permanently
residing is known or was known and applied under English law.”® In this regard,
Messers. Clive Nicholls QC and James Lewis QC state that “[i]Jn English law the
maxim ‘omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta’ applies and therefore the presumption
of regularity applies. In those circumstances it is presumed that the Immigration

Officers and the Home Office acted correctly and in accordance with their duty.”°!

81. Concerning the UK courts and their determination of the Claimant’s place of
residence, the Claimant argues that “none of the cases cited by the Respondent that
allegedly call into question the Claimant’s settlement in the United Kingdom ever
ruled on the evidence of the Claimant’s indefinite leave to remain or on the

executive findings of the Home Office regarding the fact that he had made the

United Kingdom his main home.” Messers. Clive Nicholls QC and James Lewis
QC state that “[i]t is clear that there is no ratio in those judgments concerning the
Claimant’s residence in the United Kingdom and any comments were strictly obiter
dicta.” The Claimant also argues that a number of exhibits relating to the
Claimant’s exit and entry from Turkey are tampered evidence.™ In response to a
question from the Tribunal, the Claimant explained that the Tribunal is “not bound
to follow or to take as gospel, and to take as relevant, for the purpose of this case,
the finding or comment of the court in [the UK case], because the context, the
purpose, the underlying facts and circumstances of that matter and of this matter

are not the same...”

82. Finally, the Claimant submits that neither his temporary absences from the United
Kingdom or his forced stay in Turkey cannot alter the fact that the United Kingdom
was his main home.® The Claimant interprets the “permanently residing” to mean
“main home,” and because of the use of the word “residence,” it is clear that such
a classification is not lost through temporary absences abroad.® The Claimant thus
concludes that “[i]t is not asserted or proven, nor need it be asserted or proven, that
Mr. Uzan spent a majority of his days and nights in the U.K. during the period in
question. Respondent’s insistence on the importance of documentary evidence is
inapposite. The relevant factual determinations have been made by the British

authorities.”

(c) Claimant’s Residence in France

83. The Claimant submits that he has been “permanently residing” in France since his

arrival there on September 3, 2009. The Claimant states that he has not left the

territory of France since that point in time, and thus, if the Tribunal requires any
factual link to France during this period, it has been fulfilled on this basis.” The
Claimant details his residences in Paris since his time of arrival, his marriage to a
French citizen, and his attendance at medical facilities in Paris.”° The Claimant thus
argues that “it is indisputable that the center of the Claimant's vital interests is Paris,
France, and has been the case since 2009 because it [is] where he has structured his

family, professional, economic, and social life.””!

84. The Claimant explains how the protections he has been granted by the French
authorities amount to recognition of his “permanently residing” in France in
accordance with French law. The Claimant argues that “[i]t is absolutely not
necessary, with regard to the French law, to have a legal title of permanent resident
to be considered there as living permanently in France.”’* Professor Pascal
Beauvais states that “compared to the notion of ‘permanent residence’ in the
territory, the status of beneficiary of the ‘subsidiary protection’ displays a

connecting link even stronger between the individual and a State.””?

85. Upon his arrival in France, the Claimant was first given a temporary residence
permit (récépissé) which was linked to his application for political asylum.”* The
Claimant was then given protection subsidiaire, the aim of which was to “ensure
the civil, economic, and social integration of the person who benefits from it.””°

The Claimant explains that “[a]t the heart of the protection subsidiaire is the idea

that the individual must stay in the French territory to gain protection from the

State...[and] [b]y allowing a foreign national to reside on its territory under the

protection subsidiaire, France necessarily considers that person to be a permanent

resident of France, including for the purposes of the application of the ECT to which

France participates as a Contracting Party.””° The Claimant argues that “[t]his
protection can only be removed by a judicial decision, if the fundamental interests
of France or the behaviour of the person duly established by enquiries, for example
political activities, commands it necessarily.””’ For these reasons, the Claimant
submits that no emphasis should be placed on the fact that the protection subsidiaire
is subject to renewal. The Claimant states that “the administrative authorization is

temporary, not the residence itself.””*

The Claimant therefore argues that “there can be no doubt possible that the
Claimant qualifies as ‘permanently residing’ in France, from the date of his arrival
in France in 2009 and therefore as an ‘Investor’ of another Contracting Party, that

is to say France, for the purposes of the application of the ECT.””
3. Claimant’s Conclusion

Based on the above principal arguments, as well as further arguments expanded
upon by the Claimant in his written submissions, which the Tribunal has fully
considered, the Claimant submits that he qualifies as an Investor at all relevant times

in accordance with Articles 1(7)(a)(i) and 26 of the ECT.
The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear the
Claimant’s case as the Claimant has not established his status as an “Investor” in
accordance with Articles 26 and 1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT. The Respondent submits that
the Tribunal dismiss all of the Claimant’s current claims against the Republic of

Turkey.

1. _ Interpretation of the Energy Charter Treaty

The Respondent submits that interpretation of the ECT in line with the VCLT
confirms that nationals of Turkey cannot file ECT claims against Turkey. The
Respondent explains that it is “one of the fundamental principles of international
law [] that international courts and tribunals do not have jurisdiction over purely
domestic disputes.”*° The Respondent argues that Turkey must have clearly and
unambiguously consented to being sued before an international court or tribunal.
The Respondent relies on a number of “rules and principles of international law that
require consent to arbitration to be unequivocal,” and submits that these are “part

of the law governing the present dispute pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT.”*!

Turning to the text of the ECT, the Respondent argues that there are three categories
of “Investors” under the ECT: “own Investor,” “Investor of another Contracting
Party,” and “Investor of a third state.”*? The Respondent argues that these are
mutually exclusive.*? The Respondent continues that it is “apparent that the notion
of ‘Investor of another Contracting Party’ has a clear meaning in Article 26, which
is not divorced from the rest of the ECT. The wording excludes, inter alia, claims
of a national of Turkey against Turkey, irrespective of whether she or he qualifies
as an Investor of “a Party” under Article 1(7).”** Thus, interpreting Article 26 on
its own, the Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot establish jurisdiction

thereunder.

The Respondent further argues that “permanently residing in” is a subsidiary link,
and that this is confirmed by an interpretation that is in accordance with Article 31
of the VCLT. The Respondent states that “[c]itizenship/nationality are the first links
listed reflecting the priority of these over ‘permanently residing in.’”*> The

Respondent argues that the use of the word “or” is a “disjunctive conjunction which

86 Iq,

is used inter alia to separate two or more mutually exclusive options presented.”*°

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s interpretation of “or” in this context is
a “sterile grammatical approach” that is not consistent with Article 31(1) of the
VCLT. The Respondent relies on the SCC decision of Stati v. Kazakhstan where it

was stated that:

“residence would only matter, as is clear from the wording of the
definition in Art. 1(7) ECT by the second alternative after the word “or”,

if they would not have the nationality of a Contracting State.”*”

The Respondent submits that this interpretation is the “ordinary meaning” that
should be given to “permanently residing in.” The Respondent argues that it is “not
a question of hierarchy. It [is] simply a question of reading the natural meaning of
the provision.”** The Respondent argues that international law, and in particular the
ILC articles on state responsibility, place stronger emphasis on the link of
nationality, including residence as only a fall-back link, relevant if no link of
nationality can be established.*? In his expert opinion, Professor Pellet states that
nationality is “the strongest possible bond existing between an individual and a
State...[and] it is both the basis of the right of the State to regulate the activities of
its nationals wherever they are (compétence personnelle) and the condition to
protect them vis-a-vis a foreign State.”°° The Respondent further notes that the
“overriding aspect of nationality is evident in a variety of provisions of the ECT,”
and in this regard the Respondent refers to Article 17(1) which speaks of “citizens
or nationals,” but not persons “permanently residing.”*! For these reasons, the
Respondent submits that it is not necessary to look into the travaux prépartoire in

accordance with Article 32 of the VCLT.”

However, should the Tribunal wish to turn to the travaux prépartoire, the
Respondent submits that this confirms the meaning arrived at on the basis of the
ordinary meaning. The Respondent argues that “the reference to ‘permanently
residing’ was added, based on a proposal by Australia,” because Australia does not
have the concept of nationality and “they were concerned that the definition that
was initially adopted would be too narrow.”*? The Respondent states that “[t]his
reference to ‘permanently residing’ has therefore nothing to do with the consent to
bring claims against the home State of the investor.”*+ The Respondent argues that
during the drafting of the ECT “there was no discussion or intention expressed
during the negotiations of Article 1(7) to drastically deviate from international
law.”®> The Respondent maintains that “[a]pplying the rule of treaty interpretation,
the expression ‘permanently residing in’ contained in Article 1(7) is to be construed
as a special term that denotes effective and lasting residence, as being tantamount
to nationality in Contracting Parties where the notion of nationality does not exist

in their domestic law.”°°

Turning to the Turkish FDI Law, the Respondent argues that the FDI Law is not a
subsequent practice in the application of the ECT, that it was not in force at the time
of the alleged expropriation, and that the FDI Law does not contradict the
Respondent’s position in this arbitration.*’ Regarding its alleged interpretation as a
“subsequent practice” under Article 31 of the VCLT, the Respondent argues that
the FDI Law of 2003, replacing the previous FDI Law of 1954, was aimed at
modernising the Turkish FDI policy, and there is no link between it and the ECT.**
The Respondent further argues that “[t]he possibility of a Turkish citizen suing the
Republic before international courts or tribunals was not an issue since the FDI Law
of 2003 does not provide Turkey’s consent to arbitrate any disputes. The FDI Law

arbitration agreements with foreign investors.”°? The Respondent highlights the
differences between both the substantive protections and the procedural rights
afforded in the FDI Law and the ECT in arguing that the FDI Law cannot be
considered a subsequent practice in order to satisfy the requirements of Article 31

of the VCLT.!°

The Respondent argues that “[t]he FDI Law of 2003 would not be applicable in this
arbitration in any event as it was enacted after the dispute arose.”!°! The Respondent
submits that the FDI Law came into force on June 17, 2003, however, the date of
the alleged expropriation was June 12, 2003.'°? Furthermore, the Respondent
submits that even if the FDI Law of 1954 was applicable, it does not regard foreign

residents as foreign investors but instead focuses on the origin of the investment.!%

Furthermore, the Respondent submits that the FDI Law does not contradict the
Respondent’s position. The Respondent argues that there are “no unified standards
binding Turkey at the international law level” as Turkey has not adopted a “one-
size-fits-all” approach in its investment treaties.!°* The Respondent continues that
“if one were to accept the Claimant’s contention that the FDI Law of 2003 and the
ECT are on the same level, Turkey would be contradicting most of its own BITs
through the FDI Law of 2003 in one way or another.”!°° The Respondent submits
that in order to succeed on a claim of estoppel, the Claimant must show that he had
relied on the representation made to him to his detriment. However, the Respondent
states that the Claimant’s own arguments in this regard suggest that he does not rely
on the FDI Law in terms of establishing jurisdiction, yet he is relying on the law for

purposes of establishing estoppel. The Respondent concludes that “[t]his internal

inconsistency in the Claimant’s argument is a text book example of circular

reasoning and is another ground for rejecting his estoppel argument.”!°°

Turning to the criteria required in order to be considered “permanently residing in,”
the Respondent submits that there are three such criteria: (1) that the Claimant is in
fact residing in the Contracting State; (2) that on the critical dates the Claimant lived
in the territory “permanently,” and; (3) that the fact of permanently residing is
recognised as such under the domestic law of the Contracting State in which the
Claimant claims to be permanently residing.'°’ The Respondent argues that the
Claimant’s interpretation is not compatible with the “ordinary meaning” of the
terms used.'°* The Respondent states that “permanently residing in” does not refer
to a status, as it is a verb, and not a noun.! And, “permanently” means indefinitely,
and not temporarily, or based on a temporary status.'!° The Respondent argues that
the wording in Article (1)(7)(a)(i) “in accordance with its applicable law” is a renvoi
that “expresses an independent and additional requirement that a claimant invoking
Article 1(7) must prove.”!'! The Respondent submits that “[a] person who lives in
a country provisionally based on a temporary permit or a provisional authorization
does not live permanently in that country in accordance with the applicable law.”!!?
Lastly in relation to this point, the Respondent argues that “this international
tribunal is not bound by the determination or the determinations of the national
authorities as to permanent residence or authority to reside. This is a matter of
evidence for this Tribunal...[t]his Tribunal must determine independently, within
its own jurisdictions, applying rules and principles of treaty interpretation, whether

it has jurisdiction.”!!

2. The Claimant’s Status as an Investor in Accordance with Article

1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT

The Respondent submits that the Claimant does not meet the criteria enunciated in

Article 1(7)(a)(i) at all relevant times in order to qualify as an Investor thereunder.
(a) The Relevant Dates

The Respondent submits that there are two relevant dates for determining
jurisdiction, and that the Claimant must satisfy the relevant criteria on both of these
dates. The Respondent argues that “[f]irst, he must meet the criteria in Articles 10
and 13 of the ECT at the time the alleged breaches of those provisions took place
for such breaches to be possible. ..Secondly, he must meet the criteria in Article 26
of the ECT at the time he invokes the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in order for the
Tribunal to have such jurisdiction.”!'* The Respondent submits that it does not
matter whether the alleged act is instantaneous, creeping, or continuing as the
“Claimant must meet the jurisdictional requirements on both the date the claim

arose and the date the claim was filed with the SCC.”!!°

Therefore, the Respondent contends that “the Claimant must show that jurisdiction
existed on November 28, 2002, which is allegedly the date when the creeping
process started.”!! The Respondent relies on the decision in Garcia v. Venezuela

where it was held:

“[T]he relevant times to be able to invoke the protection of the [applicable
treaty] are: (a) the date on which the alleged violation occurred (in this
case, the Measures); and (b) the date on which the arbitral proceeding is
initiated, aimed at resolving the dispute between the investor and the State

receiving the investment resulting from the alleged violation. ”"!'”

The Respondent argues that the Claimant must also meet the jurisdictional
requirements on the date he filed the Request for Arbitration, the reasons for that
being that “on that date the Claimant purported to accept Turkey’s consent to

arbitrate under the ECT.”!!8

Furthermore, the Respondent submits that the only relevant events occurred in
2002-2003. The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s reliance on events that
occurred in 2013 and 2014 “is a complete misrepresentation of the record.”!!? The
Respondent explains that “CEAS and Kepez never owned the transmission
facilities. The assets always belonged to the State, to the treasury. Under the
Concession Agreement, they had the right to operate those assets, and when the
Concession Agreements were terminated in June 2003, the assets continued to be
State property. So there can be no basis for a composite or creeping
expropriation.”!2° The Respondent states that “[i]n 2013 and 2014 an internal
reorganisation was undertaken at the recommendation of the Court of Accounts
(Sayistay) whereby some of the generation facilities were transferred from the
accounts of the Treasury to the accounts of EUAS.”!! The Respondent therefore
concludes that the real dispute between the Parties “concerns the enactment of the
Licensing and Transfer Regulations in 2002 and the termination of the CEAS and
Kepez Concession Agreements and repossession of the State facilities they had run
in June 2003. In order for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction to hear this actual
dispute, the Claimant must prove that he fulfils the requirements of jurisdiction
ratione personae in 2002-2003, as well as in 2014, when this arbitration was

commenced.”

Further in support of its argument that the date of the alleged breach was 2002-
2003, the Respondent refutes the Claimant’s arguments that the alleged breach was
continuous and/or composite. The Respondent argues that the real dispute concerns

instantaneous acts in 2002 and 2003.

Regarding continuous acts, the Respondent submits that “[c]ontinuous breaches
create an illegal situation, which can be contrasted with an illegal act...[T]he
Claimant’s main claim, is quintessentially an instantaneous (or, in the case of
creeping expropriation, a composite) act, which has continuing effects. In this
regard it can be contrasted with omissions, such as failures to pay a sum due (if the
obligation to pay is the primary obligation), or acts which inherently contain a time
element, such as delay, which are easy to recognise as continuous.”!?? Responding
to the Claimant’s reliance on the Loizidou case, the Respondent argues that this is
no longer good law, and that the ILC’s published work on state responsibility makes
it clear that “expropriation is not a continuous act...”!?> The Respondent explains
that “[c]laiming that an expropriation is a continuing breach simply because the
economic effects continue is akin to saying that any breach of international law is
a continuing breach until reparations have been made.”!*+ In any event, the
Respondent argues that Loizidou “has nothing to do with expropriation.”!75 The
Respondent states that Loizidou “was a question of whether there was interference
with the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions under Article 1 of the additional
protocol of the European Convention of Human Rights. That is not a claim for
expropriation, it is a question of whether there was interference with the property

rights, the right to enjoyment, the peaceful enjoyment, of possessions.”!?°

Regarding composite acts, the Respondent argues that in determining whether there
has been a composite act, “the critical criterion is the course of the conduct, as a
whole, constituting something more than the sum of its parts. The individual acts
cannot constitute the same alleged wrong as the composite whole. In the specific
context of international investment law, the most common example of a composite
act is a practice exhibiting an illegal policy (and a creeping expropriation resulting

from such practice).”!?’ Even if the alleged acts are accepted as being composite in

nature, the Respondent argues that the Claimant must show that he was permanently

residing in another Contracting Party to the ECT from 2002 to 2014.!?8

106. Lastly regarding the relevant dates, the Respondent refutes the Claimant’s
contention that he alone holds dominion over the alleged relevant dates.'2? The

Respondent relies on Continental Casualty v. Argentina which held that:

“[It] does not mean necessarily that the ‘Claimant's description of the
facts must be accepted as true,’ without further examination of any type.
The Respondent might supply evidence showing that the case has no
factual basis even at a preliminary scrutiny, so that the Tribunal would not
be competent to address the subject matter of the dispute as properly

determined.”!°

107. Thus, the Respondent submits that “even a ‘preliminary scrutiny’ or ‘summary
exam’ reveals that no continuous or composite breach of the ECT could have
occurred in the present case, or than anything occurred in 2013-14 that could have

amounted to a breach of the ECT.”!3!

108. The Respondent therefore concludes that the Claimant must establish jurisdiction
under the ECT on the date of the alleged breach and on the date of filing his Request

for Arbitration.
(b) Claimant’s Residence in the United Kingdom

109.

So

Firstly examining the Claimant’s “leave to remain” granted to him by the United
Kingdom, the Respondent submits that doubts exist as to whether the copies of the
Claimant’s passport (Exhibit C-1) are genuine, but that if the Tribunal were to find
it to be genuine “it would be at most prima facie evidence of permanent

residence.”!* Nevertheless, the Respondent argues that “[b]oth experts [] agree that

the closest, albeit inexact analogy in English law, to being “permanently residing
in” is settled. Being settled as a matter of English law requires that three conditions
are fulfilled: That the person is free from any restrictions on the period for which
he remains in the UK; that he is ordinarily resident in the UK at the relevant time;
and he has not remained in the UK in breach of immigration laws.” The
Respondent accepts that the first condition may have been fulfilled if the Tribunal
accepts the Exhibit C-1 as genuine. Turning to the second condition, the
Respondent argues that this requires ordinary residence which “must be
accompanied by a settled purpose which again must be proven.”!*4 The Respondent
explains that “[t]here is no evidence here of ordinary residence, let alone a settled
purpose.”'*> Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the Claimant may have
breached United Kingdom immigration laws as the photocopy of his leave to
remain did not allow him to enter as an investor, and the Claimant was thereby not
entitled to engage in business activities.'*° The Respondent states that “[t]he
conclusion is that this illegality, namely, conducting business in England, in breach

of the express terms of the leave, would again defeat the claim of being settled.”!*”

The Respondent reiterates its argument that the Tribunal should not blindly accept
the determinations of the United Kingdom authorities without further examination.
The Respondent argues that “[i]t is for the Tribunal and nobody else to decide
whether the Claimant fulfils the criteria for having “permanently resided in [the

United Kingdom] in accordance with its laws.”!°8

Turning to whether the Claimant was permanently residing in the United Kingdom
between 2002 and 2003, the Respondent submits that the Claimant was actually
permanently residing in Turkey at all the relevant times. The Respondent argues
that “[in the Claimant’s second affidavit, the Claimant] denies the relevance of the

numerous references in multiple court cases to his own pleadings and evidence in

which he submitted or testified that he resided in Turkey at the relevant time...”!*?

The Respondent states that the Claimant has himself previously denied his
residence in the United Kingdom in other proceedings, and in particular in the case
of the Telsim fraud. The Respondent explains that the primary venue for the Telsim
fraud litigation was New York, but that the English courts became involved when
Motorola sought a worldwide freezing order from the English courts in support of
the New York litigation.'*° The Respondent continues that the Claimant “contested
the injunction, a key argument being that the court had no jurisdiction over him
since he was neither domiciled nor resident in the United Kingdom. He was given
several chances to comply with an order to disclose assets and appear for cross-
examination, but refused to do so. Ultimately the court was left with no alternative
than to condemn him for contempt of court and subject him to a prison term in
December 2002 — a month after the Transfer Regulation was implemented. This
judgment was not enforced as Cem Uzan has never set foot in England.”!4! The
Respondent refers to a Judgment of the United Kingdom Court of Appeal which

stated that:

“the point of principle...at the heart of the appeals [was] whether a world-
wide freezing order should be made...where the defendant [was] neither

domiciled nor resident within the jurisdiction. ”!”

112. The Respondent argues that the Claimant has also argued before the New York
courts that he was residing in Turkey, at the relevant times. The Respondent refers
to the Claimant’s own “Counterclaims” in the New York litigation, dated October
15, 2002, which states that:

“Counter-Plaintiff Cem Uzan is a citizen of and resides in Turkey.”!*

The Respondent argues that these judgments and evidence from the New York and
English court proceedings are “highly persuasive evidence” as they are
“contemporaneous,” “based on the Claimant’s own evidence and submissions to
courts,” and show that “the Claimant was not residing in the UK in 2002 and

2003.”!44

As further proof of the Claimant’s residence in Turkey between 2002 and 2003, the
Respondent argues that the Claimant voted in the Beykoz district of Istanbul in
November 2002, and “[s]ince it was not possible during the 2002 elections to vote
at diplomatic missions abroad, only voters residing in Turkey had a right to vote.
Accordingly, of the Claimant’s allegation that he was residing in the United
Kingdom in 2002 was true, he simply could not have voted, since Turkish Civil
Law provides that a person can only have one permanent residence.”!# The
Respondent also makes reference to the Claimant’s tax returns which were filed in

Turkey from 1998 to 2003.'°

The Respondent highlights the length of the Claimant’s stays in the United
Kingdom when the Claimant was actually within the jurisdiction. The Respondent
argues that custom records confirm that the Claimant could not have been present
in the United Kingdom for a total of no more than 38 days during the entirety of the
years 2001-2009.'*” While the Claimant has argued that these entry and exit records
were forged, the Respondent replies that these were merely translation errors that
have since been corrected in Exhibit R-464 (bis), and that any double entries or
exits were likely the result of the Claimant travelling by sea and failing to have his
entry recorded at the relevant port.'*® The Respondent further notes that the
Claimant does not dispute the accuracy of any of the entry and exit records, and that
the Claimant has not taken the opportunity to produce originals of all of his

passports for examination, and thus “[t]he fact that the Claimant could have spent

no more than 38 days in the United Kingdom in 2001-2009 remains substantively

unchallenged.”!4?

The Respondent therefore concludes that the Claimant was not factually
permanently residing in the United Kingdom between 2002 and 2003, and that the
Claimant also does not meet the legal criteria in order to be considered
“permanently residing in [the United Kingdom] in accordance with its applicable
laws.” The Respondent submits that the Claimant was in fact residing in Turkey

over the course of this period of time.
(c) Claimant’s Residence in France

The Respondent submits that the Claimant has not established that he has been
“permanently residing in [France] in accordance with its applicable laws” at the

time of filing his Request for Arbitration with the SCC.

Regarding the Claimant’s actual residence since 2009, the Respondent “objects to
the Claimant’s conclusion that his permanent residence in France may be inferred
from the unproven fact that he ‘has not once left the French territory since his arrival
in 2009.’ At best, this could be (if proven) an indication of residing in France, not
of permanently residing there.”!>° The Respondent questions the lease agreements
that have been produced by the Claimant and states that these “are not accompanied
by any evidence that he actually lived in these apartments...”!>! The Respondent
highlights that the Claimant has not produced any documents showing his affiliation
to associations, clubs or social organisations, nor has he produced documents such
as vehicle insurance policies, which would typically be held by a person

permanently residing in France.!*?

The Respondent further objects to the Claimant’s
late introduction of his marriage certificate to a French national, but in any event

submits that the marriage was in November 2012, and adding three years to that

(the time required by law to become resident by virtue of marriage) would fall later

than the filing of the March 2014 Request for Arbitration.!°*

Turning to whether the Claimant can be considered to be “permanently residing in
[France] in accordance with its applicable laws,” the Respondent argues that the
permits that have been granted to the Claimant are temporary in nature and do not
grant to the Claimant the right to permanently reside in France.'*+ The Respondent
refers to the documentary evidence that has been produced by the Claimant and
submits that these documents are not permits, but rather receipts (récépissé), and
that there have been a number of gaps in the record concerning the Claimant’s status
at particular points in time.'*> The Respondent argues that “[t]here is no evidence
whatsoever that at the time of the introduction of this arbitration, Mr. Uzan had
anything but subsidiary protection, and even the subsidiary protection is not

properly evidenced.”!°°

Furthermore, the Respondent argues that any subsidiary protection afforded to the
Claimant would have been obtained by making misrepresentations on Turkish law
and the Libananco arbitration to the French authorities.'!°’ The Respondent states
that the Claimant had submitted to the French authorities that he had been
condemned to over 50 years of prison terms in Turkey because those prison terms
would have been cumulative. '>8 However, the Respondent submits that this is not
true, the prison terms would not have accumulated, and the maximum amount of

time the Claimant would have served in prison would have been 28 years.'°?

The Respondent refutes the Claimant’s argument that subsidiary protection creates
a connection between the Claimant and France that is stronger than permanent

residence.'© The Respondent argues that such subsidiary protection is by nature

temporary and that “[s]ubsidiary protection and corollary rights will only be
guaranteed as long as the circumstances for which it was granted in the first place
have not ceased to exist; at which times the French authorities may take the decision
— at any time and on their own motion — to revoke the status.”!°! The Respondent
highlights the differences between temporary residence permits and permanent
residence permits.!° The Respondent relies on the legal opinion of Professor Tchen

who states that:

“The beneficiaries of [temporary residence permits] are not, however,
entitled to a permanent residence in the sense that their will to remain in
France is not binding on the authorities. Indeed, the law imposes time
limits on their stay based on a factor they do not control and that does not

allow them to claim unlimited residence.”!°

The Respondent argues that there is a difference between subsidiary protection and
asylum status. The Respondent submits that “[uJnder French law, a refugee is
granted a ten-year residence permit (as opposed to a one-year permit for the
beneficiary of subsidiary protection), which is automatically renewable (whereas
the renewal of the permit granted to beneficiaries of subsidiary protection is subject
to a review of the person’s situation).”'* Thus, the Respondent concludes that
“subsidiary protection is, by essence, not compatible with the notion of permanently
residing: this form of asylum will always be conditioned by facts falling outside the
protected person’s control, which is the most important factor distinguishing
between the right to reside permanently and temporarily.”!® For the above reasons,
the Respondent submits that the Claimant was not “permanently residing in
[France] in accordance with its applicable laws” when the Claimant filed his

Request for Arbitration.

3. Respondent’s Conclusion

Based on the above principal arguments, as well as further arguments expanded
upon by the Respondent in its written submissions, which the Tribunal has fully
considered, the Respondent submits that the Claimant does not qualify as an
Investor at all relevant times in accordance with Articles 1(7)(a)(i) and 26 of the

ECT.

C. Decision on the Respondent’s Objection of Ratione Personae

124.

125.

126.

127.

128.

Having summarized the main elements of each Party’s case, the Tribunal will now

address the Respondent’s objection on the grounds of ratione personae.
The Tribunal notes Article 22(1) of the SCC Rules, which provides:

The Arbitral Tribunal shall decide the merits of the dispute on the basis of
the law(s) or rules of law agreed upon by the parties. In the absence of
such agreement, the Arbitral Tribunal shall apply the law or rules of law

which it considers to be most appropriate.

In their submissions, the Parties have relied on a number of different sources of law,
at both a national and international level. The Tribunal thus relies on the Parties’
submissions regarding the applicable laws, and identifies and applies the agreed

upon and most appropriate laws on an issue by issue basis.
1. Interpretation of Articles 1(7)(a)(i) and 26 of the ECT

The Claimant seeks to bring a number of claims against the Republic of Turkey
relating to an investment made by the Claimant in the Republic of Turkey, and the
alleged unlawful seizure and expropriation of that investment by the Republic of

Turkey in violation of the provisions of the ECT.

In disputing that the Claimant has jurisdiction to bring these current claims, the
Respondent argues that the Claimant has not established jurisdiction ratione
personae, because the Claimant does not qualify as an “Investor” within the

meaning of the ECT.

41

SCC Arbitration V 2014/023 — Award on Respondent’s Bifurcated Preliminary Objection

129. Article 26 of the ECT, entitled “Settlement of Disputes Between an Investor and a
Contracting Party,” sets out the means by which Investors and Contracting Parties
to the ECT may settle their disputes. Part (1) of Article 26 defines the disputes
which are capable of settlement in accordance with the following sections of Article
26:

Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the
former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former

under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

130.

S

Article 26(1) contains two terms that are separately defined within the ECT. Article
1 of the ECT contains the definition section. Article 1(2) defines a “Contracting

Party” as:

[A] state or Regional Economic Integration Organization which has

consented to be bound by this Treaty and for which the Treaty is in force.

131. There is no dispute that Turkey is a Contracting Party to the ECT.

132.

N

Article 1(7) contains the definition of “Investor,” and sub-article (a) thereof defines
the meaning of “Investor” “with respect to a Contracting Party.” The Claimant
argues that he comes within the definition of “Investor” contained within Article

1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT, which provides:

[A] natural person having the citizenship or nationality of or who is
permanently residing in that Contracting Party in accordance with its

applicable law.

133. The Claimant seeks to invoke the status of “permanently residing in” in order to

establish the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to hear the Claimant’s claims.

134. It is clear to the Tribunal that in order to establish jurisdiction ratione personae, the
Claimant must show that he satisfies the criteria for being an Investor laid down in

Article 1(7)(a)(i), as this term is contained within Article 26. Article | is a definition

42
SCC Arbitration V 2014/023 — Award on Respondent’s Bifurcated Preliminary Objection

section, intended to give meaning to terms used throughout the ECT, relating to the

substance of the ECT, its scope and protections.

135. The Tribunal emphasises that, like any arbitration agreement, the basis of the
agreement to arbitrate arises from consent: the consent of both an Investor and a
Contracting Party to have their dispute heard by a Tribunal constituted in
accordance with the SCC Rules, per Article 26(4)(c) of the ECT. Thus, it must be
clearly established that the Parties have agreed to arbitrate the current claims in
dispute.!°° The Claimant must therefore satisfy the Tribunal that he is an Investor,
within the meaning of the ECT, so that he was capable of accepting the
Respondent’s consent to arbitrate when he filed his Request for Arbitration on

March 7, 2014.

136. In interpreting the ECT, the Tribunal seeks guidance from the VCLT, which assists
in the interpretation of treaties, containing both general rules of interpretation and
supplementary means of interpretation. Article 31 of the VCLT, entitled “General

Rules of Interpretation” provides in sub-article (1) that:

A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the

light of its object and purpose.

137. The Parties agree on the application of Article 31 in interpreting Articles 1(7)(a)(i)
and 26 of the ECT. The Tribunal therefore seeks to give effect to the ordinary
meaning of the language contained within the ECT. However, the Tribunal notes
that the phrase “ordinary meaning” is immediately followed by “to be given to the
terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.” The
Tribunal understands this to mean that a simple dictionary reading of the terms ina
treaty is not what is called for. Rather, a treaty’s language must be examined having
regard also to the entirety of the text read together (to provide context), and having

regard to what the objects and purposes were in enacting the treaty. Thus, the

 

166 “Tt is a well-established principle, both in domestic and international law, that such an agreement should
be clear and unambiguous.” Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria, Decision on Jurisdiction,
ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, dated February 8, 2005, {[ 198 (Exhibit CLA-052).

43
SCC Arbitration V 2014/023 — Award on Respondent’s Bifurcated Preliminary Objection

Tribunal is obliged to seek to give meaning to the wording of the ECT as drafted,
beyond what could possibly be garnered from an overly grammatical reading of the

relevant provisions.

138. Should the Tribunal determine that it is not possible to decipher the “ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its
object and purpose,” the Tribunal shall turn to the “Supplementary Means of

Interpretation” in accordance with Article 32 of the VCLT. Article 32 provides:

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including
the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion,
in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article
31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to
article 31:

(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or

(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

139. Turning to the wording of Article 1(7)(a)(i), there are three ways in which a natural
person may qualify as an Investor: (1) having the nationality of, or (2) having the
citizenship of, or (3) permanently residing in a Contracting Party to the ECT in
accordance with its applicable law. The first two requirements have an identical
meaning and can be considered as one. There is no dispute that the Claimant is a
national of the Republic of Turkey, and that he does not hold nationality or

citizenship of any other country, or any other Contracting Party to the ECT.

140. The Tribunal must therefore determine whether the element of “permanently
residing in that Contracting Party” entitles an Investor, without more, to commence
an arbitration against a Contracting Party of which he or she is a national or citizen.
The Tribunal does not accept the Respondent’s argument that the structure of
Article 1(7)(a)(i) creates a hierarchy between the different types of Investor.
“{PJermanently residing in” cannot be considered to be a subsidiary link. The
structure of Article 1(7)(a)(i) and the use of the conjunction “or” creates an equal

set of criteria for determining whether a natural person is an Investor. To interpret

44
SCC Arbitration V 2014/023 — Award on Respondent’s Bifurcated Preliminary Objection

the conjunction “or” in the manner that the Respondent suggests would not be line
with the natural and ordinary meaning of the text. Had the meaning that the
Respondent posits been so intended, this could have been expressed using clearer
and more precise language. While under general international law nationality may
be a stronger link than “permanently residing in,” the Tribunal is satisfied that the
ECT does not on its face seek to create a hierarchical relationship between the
criteria of nationality and permanently residing. The wording of Article 1(7)(a)(i)
appears to be broad in scope. Without having to examine the preparatory works of
the ECT, it is clear that its “object and purpose” was to create a wide expanding
energy framework for the ease and encouragement of international energy
investments. As has been evidenced in these proceedings, the Contracting Parties
to the ECT address the issues of nationality, citizenship and permanent residence in
different ways. The inclusion of “permanently residing” appears to have been
intended to give protection to investors who may not meet the often strict
requirements for nationality and citizenship, as defined by a particular Contracting

Party. The Tribunal agrees with the statement of Professor Leben that:

“If the States had wanted to make a restriction of such importance, they

would have certainly indicated so.”!”

141. The Tribunal further accepts the Claimant’s argument that it is not necessary to turn
to customary international law in determining the meaning of “Investor” in Article
1(7)(a)(i) and whether an Investor can sue a Contracting Party of which they are a
national. The Tribunal considers the ECT to be a /ex specialis. The Tribunal takes
note of the decision of Serafin Garcia Armas and Karina Garcia v. Venezuela,

where it was stated that:

“In this award, the Tribunal shed light on the fact that contemporaneous
international law, investor protection, and dispute resolution linked to it
are essentially governed by bilateral or multilateral treaties for the
protection of foreign investment, such as bilateral investment treaties and

contracts between investors and States. As a consequence, the role of

‘61 Legal Opinion of Professor Charles Leben, dated February 16, 2015, | 20.

45
SCC Arbitration V 2014/023 — Award on Respondent’s Bifurcated Preliminary Objection

diplomatic protection has diminished, having recourse to it only when

treaties do not exist or are inoperable.”'

142. As further noted in the Serafin Garcia case, the lex specialis of the ECT is consistent
with the United Nations’ International Law Commission Draft Articles on

Diplomatic Protection, Article 17 of which provides:

The present draft articles do not apply to the extent that they are
inconsistent with special rules of international law, such as treaty

provisions for the protection of investments.

143. Paragraph 3 of the Commentary on the Draft Articles states that:

Draft article 17 makes it clear that the present draft articles do not apply
to the alternative special regime for the protection of foreign investors
provided for in bilateral and multilateral investment treaties. The
provision is formulated so that the draft articles do not apply “to the extent
that” they are inconsistent with the provisions of a BIT. To the extent that
the draft articles remain consistent with the BIT in question, they continue

to apply.

144. Thus, the Tribunal is satisfied that it is not necessary in the present instance to
investigate the content of customary international law on this issue. Even though
Article 26(6) of the ECT states that the issues in dispute shall be decided “in
accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international
law,” this cannot be taken to mean that rules of customary international law are

capable of overriding the clear text of the ECT, assuming it to exist.

145. Examining Article 1(7)(a)(i) in isolation, it is apparent that there is no order of
priority between the different classifications of Investor. Once an Investor asserts
jurisdiction based on either one of these three possible characteristics, the Investor

may not then rely on another. However, in order to establish jurisdiction, the most

dated December 15, 2014, { 172 (Exhibit CL-92, unofficial translation).

46
SCC Arbitration V 2014/023 — Award on Respondent’s Bifurcated Preliminary Objection

relevant article of the ECT is Article 26. Therefore, the Tribunal must investigate

whether the Claimant is an Investor within the meaning of Article 26 of the ECT.

146. Turning to the ordinary meaning of Article 26(1), the Tribunal considers that the
use of the word “another” is what essentially makes an Investor an international
investor. Furthermore, the words “of the latter in the Area of the former” appears
to place an emphasis on the Investor being imbued with a transnational quality —
that is to say an Investor who is engaged in some form of cross-border transaction.
The Tribunal believes that Article 26(1) implies a condition of transnationalism.
While Article 1(7)(a)(i) defines the ways in which a natural person can be an
Investor, Article 26(1) offers a further element that must be satisfied for a person to
be characterised as an Investor to whom protection — and the right to bring
proceedings — will be extended. From the ordinary meaning of Article 26(1), the
Tribunal is satisfied that an Investor must possess some cross-border characteristic

in order to be protected by the ECT (a covered Investor).

147. Examining the Claimant’s circumstances, the Tribunal notes that when the
Claimant first made his investment, he was only a national of Turkey, and he was
not — and did not claim to be — permanently residing in another Contracting Party.
The Claimant was a national, domestic investor, and not a protected “Investor”
within the meaning of the ECT. The Claimant asserts that only subsequently was

he “permanently residing” in another Contracting Party.

148. This raises the question of whether a subsequent change of residence — assuming it
to have occurred — may of itself allow the Claimant to be treated as a protected
“Investor” within the meaning of the ECT. In the view of the Tribunal, the mere
fact of the Claimant’s subsequent change of residence, as well as the reasons and
the circumstances thereof, cannot as such operate to transform the legal
characteristic of the person into an Investor, within the meaning of Article 26(1).
Though the investor may have changed residence, he was not initially an Investor
within the meaning of the ECT such as to be entitled to protections. Hypothetically
speaking, had the Claimant made additional energy investments back into the

territory of Turkey, while he was permanently residing in another Contracting

47
SCC Arbitration V 2014/023 — Award on Respondent’s Bifurcated Preliminary Objection

Party, the Claimant could possibly claim the status of Investor with respect to those
investments. However, the Tribunal is not required to make a determination on this
point, as those facts are not alleged by the Claimant, and there is no evidence before
the Tribunal that he is making any claim in respect of an investment made while he

was permanently residing in another Contracting Party.

149. The Tribunal is not able to accept the argument that the Claimant can be considered
an Investor under Article 26(1) merely by the fact of a change of residence, and
nothing more. The Tribunal is further satisfied that this reading of Article 26(1) is
in line with proper interpretation of the ECT, including by regard to its object and

purpose.

150. The Claimant has argued that the “ECT’s object is broader than most investment
agreements, which are usually based on the notion of reciprocity; rather the ECT’s
object and purpose is to encourage and create stable conditions, transparent and
favourable to investors and fostering investment in the energy sector. In this sense,
the ECT has more of the features of a ‘common area of protection’ (like NAFTA,

or MERCOSUR), with a goal of ‘creating a single energy area.””!?

151. The Tribunal is able to accept the submission that the ECT was intended to be broad
and far reaching in scope, thus including protection for natural persons permanently
residing in a Contracting Party who may not have the nationality of a Contracting

Party. Article 2 of the ECT, entitled “Purpose of the Treaty” provides:

This Treaty establishes a legal framework in order to promote long-term
co-operation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual

benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter.

152. However, the Tribunal has more difficulty in accepting that the object and purpose
of the ECT is so broad as to extend its protections to the Claimant in his particular

circumstances, and on the basis of the evidence before it. As established by the

‘9 Claimant's Reply on the Preliminary Objection to Jurisdiction Ratione Personae, dated September 20,
2015, | 96; Emmanuel Gaillard, Investments and Investors Covered by the Energy Charter Treaty, in
Clarisse Ribeiro, ed., Investment Arbitration and the Energy Charter Treaty (2006), n. 39 (Exhibit CL-94).

SCC Arbitration V 2014/023 — Award on Respondent’s Bifurcated Preliminary Objection

objectives and the implementation of the Concluding Document of the Hague
Conference of the European Energy Charter, the object and purpose of the ECT is
to protect “the international flow of investments,” and hence to protect international
investors.!”° The Claimant, no matter how he frames his arguments, is missing this
essential transnational link, in relation both to the time his “investment” was made
and when he alleges it was interfered with. The ECT was intended to protect
Investors investing into Turkey, not nationals within Turkey who make investments
in their own country. At the time the investment was made, the Claimant was plainly
not an Investor who made an investment that was entitled to any protections under
the ECT. The Tribunal does not believe that a subsequent change in residence —
assuming it to have occurred — can of itself transform the Claimant into an Investor
with respect to domestic investments already made, who is entitled to protections
under the ECT, at least not in the absence of investments made as a protected
Investor under the ECT. In the view of the Tribunal, on the evidence that is available
to it, the Claimant is not a covered Investor as he is not an “Investor of another
Contracting Party,” because on the date he made his investment, and at all times
until the alleged interference occurred, he was an investor of the Republic of

Turkey.

153. The Tribunal recognises the Claimant’s unfortunate circumstances in light of his
multiple changes of residence over a number of years, and the Tribunal does not
suggest that the Claimant has engaged in any sort of treaty shopping exercise.
However, from the ordinary meaning of Article 26(1), and having regard to the
object and purpose of the ECT, the Tribunal concludes that the ECT was not
intended to protect domestic investors in circumstances such as the Claimants, and

the Claimant’s claim thus fails at this first hurdle.

154. Having regard to the Parties’ submissions, which further addressed a number of

other issues, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to make findings on some of these

' Title I, Section 4 of the Concluding Document of the Hague Conference on the European Energy
Charter.

49
SCC Arbitration V 2014/023 — Award on Respondent’s Bifurcated Preliminary Objection

pleaded issues. These operate to confirm the Tribunal in the conclusion it has

reached.

155. As noted above, in order to satisfy the criteria of Article 1(7)(a)(i), the Claimant
must show that he was “permanently residing in that Contracting Party in

accordance with its applicable law.”

156. The Tribunal decides that there are thus two requirements that a natural person must
meet in order to be considered an Investor based on the permanently residing
criterion. The ordinary meaning of this Article necessitates a factual and a legal
component. Starting with the latter, there is no dispute that this operates a renvoi to
the domestic law of the Contracting Party. The Tribunal must look to the domestic
law of the Contracting Party in question to determine whether the Claimant
qualifies as permanently residing in that country in accordance with that law.
However, determinations by domestic authorities, while highly persuasive, are not
absolutely determinative, and the Tribunal is authorized to examine the underlying
facts in order to determine whether the Claimant has permanently resided there in
accordance with the applicable domestic law. Regarding the factual component, the
Tribunal decides that the structure of the wording “permanently residing” implies
that there must also be a determination that an Investor was actually living
permanently in the territory of the Contracting Party. This is obvious from the
ordinary and natural meaning of the text. If the intention behind Article 1(7)(a)(i)
had been to refer solely to the legal status of the natural person as defined by
domestic law, the text might have used the words “permanent resident.” The use of
“permanently residing” appears to require that a natural person should be both
permanently residing in the Contracting Party (a factual requirement), and for such
status to be recognised by local domestic law (a legal requirement). Such
interpretation avoids a situation whereby a natural person could obtain resident
permits from multiple jurisdictions (e.g. by becoming an investor in that state) in
order to avail of such state’s protections, without actually having to reside within
any of those states. The factual and legal connection of the Investor to the

Contracting Party is thus of high importance under the ECT.

2. | Claimant’s Residence in the United Kingdom

The Claimant argues that he was “permanently residing in [the United Kingdom]
in accordance with its applicable law,” during 2002 and 2003 at the time of the

alleged expropriation, including on June 11, 2003.

The Claimant recounts that he was granted “Leave to Remain” in the United
Kingdom on September 5, 1996, which was extended on August 31, 1997, and
thereafter renewed annually. On November 10, 2000, the Claimant was granted
“Indefinite Leave to Remain.” Thus, between 2002 and 2003, the Claimant’s

alleged status was that of having “Indefinite Leave to Remain.”

“Indefinite leave to remain for an investor” is defined in Section 230 of the UK
Immigration Rules. It requires that the investor should have spent a continuous
period of four years in the United Kingdom in his capacity as an investor, and that
the requirements of Section 227 of the UK Immigration Rules have been met over
this period. One such requirement, as set out in Section 227(iv) is that the investor
“has made the United Kingdom his main home.” On this basis, the Tribunal is
satisfied that the granting of indefinite leave to remain under Section 230 of the UK
Immigration Rules could be said to denote a status that might be equivalent to the
situation of a person permanently residing. The law among the Contracting States
to the ECT regarding permanent residency is broad ranging. It is not necessary that
a natural person holds a status of that precise wording in order to be considered an
Investor within the meaning of the ECT. Rather, this Tribunal determines that the
United Kingdom’s status of “Indefinite Leave to Remain” may — under the
appropriate factual circumstances — give rise to a situation which is equivalent to
permanently residing, within the meaning of Article 1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT, subject

to the point that follows.

As the Tribunal has already stated, however, having a legal status equivalent to
permanent residence does not end the inquiry that the Tribunal must engage in.
Article 1(7)(a)(i) further requires that the natural person is as a matter of fact

permanently residing in the Contracting Party. The Claimant, having been granted

Sl

161.

162.

indefinite leave to remain, was entitled to permanently reside in the United
Kingdom, but this does not lead to the automatic conclusion that the Claimant was
actually permanently residing in the United Kingdom at the times the Claimant
argues, including in June 2003. The words “permanently residing” indicates not
only that a person should have a right to permanently reside in the United Kingdom,
but that he should actually be there residing, and be doing so under conditions of

permanence.

Having examined the factual evidence submitted by the Parties over the course of
these proceedings, the Tribunal is not able to determine with certainty how many
days the Claimant actually spent in the United Kingdom over the period of time in
question. Nor is the Tribunal able to say precisely how many days the Claimant
would be required to remain in the United Kingdom in order to be considered
permanently residing therein. However, the Tribunal can draw a number of
conclusions from the evidence presented before it in order to determine where the
Claimant’s business, legal, family and social interests were centred during this

period.

The Claimant has submitted that he was permanently residing in the United
Kingdom between 1996 and 2009. In the Claimant’s Second Affidavit, the Claimant
states that he intended to make his main home in the United Kingdom, though he
believed that owning second residences in other countries and travelling outside of
the United Kingdom would not affect the status of the United Kingdom as his place
of permanent residence.'’! In the Claimant’s First Affidavit, he explains his
decision to move his principal home to the United Kingdom as a result of the

Kingdom: his family home in Halkin Street, Chelsea; his ownership of a Rolls
Royce; the location of his business premises in London; his membership in local

social clubs; and, the hiring of an English public relations firm.!”? The Claimant

164.

acknowledges, however, that he also spent a considerable amount of time travelling,
that he owned property in New York, and that in this period his children relocated

to New York for their schooling.

The Tribunal does not dispute that the Claimant had certain connections with the
United Kingdom, sufficient to be afforded indefinite leave to remain in 2000.
However, it is apparent from the record that there is more to the evidence than the
Claimant has sought to suggest. During the period in question in which the Claimant
argues he was permanently residing in the United Kingdom, the evidence also
establishes that the Claimant maintained numerous and significant links with the
Republic of Turkey. While it is not necessary to explore each of these contacts in
detail, which are all on the record, the Tribunal deems it important to comment upon

a number of these that are of particular relevance.

The Claimant filed tax returns in Turkey.!”* In a number of these tax returns the
Claimant lists his residence as being in Istanbul, Turkey. This is despite the
Claimant’s assertion that his move to the United Kingdom was inspired, in part, by
the United Kingdom’s favourable tax regime. Notwithstanding the Claimant’s
explanations for the filing of his Turkish tax returns in this way,'” the Tribunal
considers that these returns are demonstrative of a significant link with Turkey,
where the Claimant was active in operating his businesses. Further evidence has
been put forward that the Claimant voted in Turkish elections.'’® There is a dispute
over the actual significance of this as the Parties put forward differing
interpretations regarding the connection between voting and residence in Turkish
elections. Coupled with the Claimant’s establishment of a political party in Turkey
(the Geng Party), it is difficult to reconcile these actions with those of a person
whose principal business, family and social interests had migrated (on the basis of
a permanent residence) to the United Kingdom. In fact, the Claimant states in his

affidavit that “if and until [he] was successful in politics [in Turkey], [he] did not

have an intention to permanently live in Turkey.””!”” This statement is contradictory
and plainly at odds with the evidence on record. It is not immediately apparent how
the Claimant can plausibly claim that his factual place of residence was in a country
where he spent a minority of his time, even as he was becoming actively involved
in the political process of his home country. The act of setting up a political party
would tend to offer further proof of the Claimant’s strong ties to Turkey at this time,
making it less credible that the Claimant could have been permanently residing in

the United Kingdom.

165. As noted, the Tribunal refrains from identifying a minimum number of days
requirement, or establishing precisely how many days the Claimant spent in the
United Kingdom. The Claimant sought to explain — without the benefit of
supporting evidence — that on many occasions, upon his re-entry to the United
Kingdom, he was not required to pass through immigration as he was travelling on
a private plane.'* Nevertheless the Tribunal has no difficulty in concluding that the
Claimant’s various stays in the United Kingdom were not of a sufficiently
continuous or lengthy nature to allow it to determine that he should be considered
as permanently residing in the United Kingdom. The Claimant’s multiple absences
were not only spent working abroad, or living in another of his residences in New
York. The Claimant spent a considerable period of this time in Turkey. This
occurred before the Claimant was later prevented from leaving Turkey. A person
may have contacts with multiple states, whether of a business or social nature.
However, legal determinations aside, the Tribunal has some difficulty in easily
concluding, as the Claimant seeks to argue, that a natural person can be permanently
residing in more than one state at the same point in time. The evidence presented
by the Parties of the Claimant’s activities between 1996 and 2009 provides strong
evidence to indicate that the Claimant was not permanently residing in the United
Kingdom. The status of the Claimant as defined by the United Kingdom authorities

cannot alter the clarity of this factual finding.

SCC Arbitration V 2014/023 — Award on Respondent’s Bifurcated Preliminary Objection

166. While evidence of the Claimant’s movements, as well as the centre of his business
and political interests, is enough to persuade the Tribunal that the Claimant was
permanently residing in Turkey, the Tribunal takes further guidance from the
Claimant’s own prior legal submissions (in other proceedings) to reach this same
conclusion. In a judgment of the United Kingdom Court of Appeal, it was stated

that:

“[The evidence before the court demonstrated that the Claimant owned] a
valuable London property, Halkin Gate House, originally bought because
[the Claimant] intended to develop business interests in London under a
scheme which fell through, which property had been on the market for over
a year. The plaintiff had continued to visit the United Kingdom
intermittently for leisure purposes, usually staying in hotels because the
property was for sale. The house had a value of some £6 million, together
with contents left in it to create the effect of a home in order to assist
obtaining a buyer. He also had a Rolls Royce car and shares in a service
company in the United Kingdom, but otherwise his substantial assets were

in other jurisdictions, in particular Turkey and America.”!7°

167. The Court of Appeal was basing its knowledge on evidence submitted by the
Claimant himself, through his lawyers. At the beginning of this same judgment the

Court of Appeal stated that:

“The point of principle which lies at the heart of the appeals is whether a
world-wide freezing order should be made under s.25 of the CJJA in
support of an action in another jurisdiction in circumstances where the
defendant in question is neither domiciled nor resident within the
jurisdiction and there is no substantial connection between the relief

sought and the territorial jurisdiction of the English Court.”!°°

171.

Thus, the Court of Appeal was of the view that the Claimant was not domiciled in
the United Kingdom. Regardless of what issues were being determined by the Court

of Appeal, this is a definite finding of fact.

The Claimant has failed to provide any explanation for why his current submissions
regarding his then residence are now different from submissions that he made to
domestic courts on this same issue. At the Hearing, the Tribunal presented this issue

to counsel for the Claimant as follows:

“Prof. Sands: So my follow-up question is, what are we to make of that
submission [by Claimant’s counsel, Mr. Strauss QC to the Court of
Appeal], which appears to be rather clear, at least insofar as it relates to
the statement and submission that Mr. Uzan was not a resident of the

United Kingdom in 2002?

You are asking us to conclude that although that submission was made in
those, as you say different circumstances, he was not a resident but he was
nevertheless permanently residing in the United Kingdom. Is that your

submission?
Mr. Hendel: Yes.”"*!

In response to questions from the Tribunal regarding these same submissions by

then counsel for the Claimant, the Claimant himself states that:

“The Witness: Sir, really don’t remember whether I met him [Mr. Strauss
QC], whether I gave him any instructions or I didn’t give him instructions.

I don’t recall.”!*

The Tribunal is unable to accept the Claimant’s explanation in this regard. The
evidence before it is clear that the Claimant’s own lawyers argued before English
courts that the Claimant was not a resident of the United Kingdom. The fact that the

English proceedings related to different matters, including the obtaining of a

worldwide freezing order, does not take away from the simplicity of the core issue:
was the Claimant permanently residing in the United Kingdom in 2002 and 2003?
The Tribunal is unimpressed with the Claimant’s efforts to obtain affidavits and
court submissions from the English and New York court proceedings, which may
have provided further guidance as to the Claimant’s position at that time, as ordered
by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 5. Nevertheless, the further factual
evidence in these proceedings is in line with the arguments that were made by the
Claimant himself before the English courts. Relating to the Claimant’s asserted
residence in France, the Claimant has stated that “it is indisputable that the center
of the Claimant’s vital interests is Paris, France, and has been the case since 2009
because it [is] where he has structured his family, professional, economic, and
social life.”!8? Based on the evidence before this Tribunal, it cannot be concluded
that the Claimant’s “vital interests” were in the United Kingdom between 2002 and
2003, and this is not where he appeared to structure “his family, professional,

economic, and social life.”

172. The only conclusion that the Tribunal can draw from all of the evidence before it is
that the Claimant was not “permanently residing in” the United Kingdom between
2002 and 2003, and in particular on June 11, 2003. It follows from this that the
Claimant on that date could not have been an Investor in accordance with Article

17a).
3. Claimant’s Residence in France

173. The Claimant argues that he fulfils both the factual and legal requirements in order
to be considered “permanently residing in [France] in accordance with its applicable

law.

174. The Claimant states that he arrived in France on September 3, 2009, after fleeing
from Turkey. The Claimant was first given a temporary residence permit, before

being afforded protection subsidiaire. The question is therefore whether protection

subsidiaire is equivalent to the act of permanently residing in accordance with
French law. The Claimant has argued that “[iJt is absolutely not necessary, with
regard to the French law, to have a legal title of permanent resident to be considered
there as living permanently in France.”!** The Parties have made thorough legal

submissions and the Tribunal has heard from the Parties’ experts on this point.

175. The Tribunal agrees that the aim of the protection subsidiaire regime is to ensure
the civil, economic and social integration of the person who benefits from it. The
system, it appears, is designed to accommodate the full integration into French

society of the protected person. In his legal opinion, Professor Beauvais states that:

“More than a simple right of residence (or residency), subsidiary
protection thus constitutes a connection to a new State of an individual
who is no longer protected by his State of origin. Therefore, granting
subsidiary protection reflects a divide, or even a destruction, of the factual
and legal relation to the State of origin and the establishment of a new
legal, civil and administrative relation, primarily, with the protecting
State. In a way, the connecting link of the individual with the protecting
State partially replaces that which exists with the State of origin. Thus, the
protecting State guarantees one of the strongest State protections that

exists...

176. Thus, while the Claimant still holds the nationality of Turkey, the state of France
has effectively stepped into the shoes of Turkey in terms of providing the Claimant
with the protections that would normally be afforded by one’s home country. In
fact, the holder of protection subsidiaire receives such a status based on their
persecution (as determined by the French authorities in this case) by their home

state.

177. Professor Beauvais details a number of benefits that a holder of protection

subsidiaire receives from France, including: right of access to employment;

education; social protection; health services; and, housing.!8° The holder of
protection subsidiaire appears to be treated, for most intents and purposes, as a

permanent resident of France.
178. Professor Beauvais further states that:

“By definition, the territory from which the beneficiary departs and
returns to during his travel is that of the protecting State. Although, in
principle, the protecting State may not impede the freedom of movement of
persons benefiting from the subsidiary protection, the characteristics of
this permit indicates it is its responsibility to limit and monitor the exercise
of said freedom. The existence of this restrictive regime of movement, let
alone of installation, into other States from the protecting state territory
logically leads to the conclusion that the protecting State is the permanent

residency of the recipient of the subsidiary protection status. ”!°”

179. These characteristics of the protection subsidiaire points to the Claimant’s position
that it is capable of constituting permanent residency. However, the Tribunal does
not go as far as the Claimant to suggest that protection subsidiaire is a stronger
connecting link than holding a French permanent residence card. It is sufficient to
say that protection subsidiaire is a connecting link that is equivalent to “residing

permanently in [France] in accordance with its applicable law.”

180. The Respondent has argued that a person holding protection subsidiaire must seek
renewal of this status annually, thus demonstrating that the protection cannot be

characterised as permanent in nature. Professor Tchen notes that:

“the right to reside does appear as an accessory to subsidiary
protection. Indeed, how could a beneficiary of subsidiary protection be
residing ‘permanently’ when it is the consequence of a factual situation

(analysed as a persecution) that can be requalified at any time? ”!®®

Professor Tchen describes the protection subsidiaire as a “fragile right to reside.”'®?

Professor Tchen further states that:

“The law did not establish a right to reside permanently in France. If such
were the case, why limit the duration of the residence permit to two years
instead of proposing to grant a residence permit similar to that of statutory

refugees?!

In response, Mr. Francois Sureau argues that:

“although the residency card is limited in time and renewable, the
protection granted under subsidiary protection is continuous and does not

depend on the condition for the issuance of the permit to stay.”!?!

The Tribunal has already recognised that holders of protection subsidiaire are
provided with a host of protections and benefits by France. The protection
subsidiaire entitles the holders to establish their family, professional, and social
lives within France. The Tribunal considers that the necessity to extend such
protection does not take away from its permanency. There are a number of reasons
why the holders of permanent residence cards in France may have such status
revoked. Such permits can be revoked for reasons including polygamy, violence on
a child under the age of 15, and an individual stay for more than three years in a

third country.!°?

Thus, the idea that any permanent residence will definitively last
forever is not realistic. The Tribunal prefers to proceed on the basis that permanent
residency (within the meaning of the ECT) should be capable of lasting for the
duration of a person’s life. The fact that it may be revoked at a future point in time
is not relevant. Protection subsidiaire is capable of lasting for the duration of a

person’s life.

The Respondent argues that because the Claimant’s situation is subject to

reassessment, the Claimant’s holding of protection subsidiaire is incapable of being

considered as a permanent residency. However, the Tribunal does not believe it fit
to base such a status on a future hypothetical event. The Tribunal has already stated
that the Claimant cannot say that his permanent residency was in the United
Kingdom while he began his political career in Turkey, and that this was subject to
succeeding in Turkish politics. Similarly, the Tribunal would find it difficult to
conclude that the Claimant is receiving protection and benefits from France,
without a definite end date, but that because a reassessment may change this status
in one, five, 10 or 15 years, the Claimant is not to be considered to be permanently
residing in France (within the meaning of the ECT) at this exact point in time. The
Respondent’s interpretation of protection subsidiaire may be seen as overly
formalistic and not in accordance with the reality of the situations of those people
to whom it benefits, including the Claimant in this instance. The Tribunal therefore
decides that the Claimant’s possession of protection subsidiaire from the
Government of France is sufficient to consider the Claimant as presently

permanently residing in France, within the meaning of the ECT.

185. The Claimant must also show that he has in fact been permanently residing in
France in order to meet the requirements of Article 1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT. The
Tribunal does not have difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the Claimant has
satisfied this burden. The Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant has not left the
jurisdiction of France since his arrival there in 2009. The Claimant has further
provided to the Tribunal details of his residences over a period of time in which he
has lived in Paris.'?? The Claimant has begun making fiscal declarations in
France.'°* The Respondent argues that the proofs provided by the Claimant are not
sufficient to establish his factual permanent residence in France. While the burden
is on the Claimant to prove his permanent residence in France, the Tribunal
recognises that there has been no alternative put forward for where the Claimant
has been permanently residing from 2009. The Tribunal has not been presented with

evidence of any other permanent residence since the Claimant arrived in France in
193 See Exhibit C-147; Exhibit C-148; Exhibit C-149; Exhibit C-150.
194 See Exhibit C-153; Exhibit C-154.

September 2009. Thus, the Tribunal can only rely on the evidence before it which

in this case points to the Claimant’s presence in France since 2009.

186. The Tribunal reiterates that determining whether an individual has been
permanently residing in a state should not be a counting of days exercise, and there
is no magic number in this regard. However, where an individual has been residing
continuously within a country (legally), for more than six years, and without the
ability to leave, this provides strongly persuasive evidence of that individual’s
permanently residing over that course of time. The Tribunal is satisfied that since
2009, the Claimant has structured his family, social, economic and professional life

in France.

187. However, as the Tribunal has already determined, permanently residing in a
Contracting Party is not sufficient to determine that the Claimant is an Investor in
accordance with Articles 1(7)(a)(i) and 26(1) of the ECT, as the Claimant is not an
Investor “of another Contracting Party.” Therefore, despite the Claimant’s
permanently residing in France, the Claimant cannot qualify as an Investor. The
Tribunal is therefore further unable to find jurisdiction within the Claimant’s French

law arguments.
4. Conclusion

188. The Tribunal is mindful of the Claimant’s current personal circumstances.
However, the Tribunal has been tasked with deciding upon a number of legal and
factual questions that are unrelated to the merits of the Claimant’s case. In
interpreting the ECT, the Tribunal has sought to give effect to the ordinary meaning
of its provisions, in line with the objects and purposes behind the Treaty.
Establishing that the Claimant may fit the definition of an “Investor” at a particular
point in time is only part of the inquiry. The Tribunal is persuaded that Article 26(1)
of the ECT does not seek to protect the Claimant in the present circumstances. Both
the wording of this Article, as well as the objects and purposes behind the ECT,

clearly indicate the Treaty’s intention to protect foreign Investors, from “another”

Contracting Party. The Claimant has not demonstrated that the facts of his case are

in line with this definition.

Even taking the Claimant’s arguments regarding the interpretation of Articles
1(7)(a)G@) and 26 as correct, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant was not
“permanently residing in” the United Kingdom between 2002 and 2003, thus
placing an insurmountable obstacle in the Claimant’s path to recovery under the

ECT.

Furthermore, permanently residing in France cannot establish that the Claimant is
an Investor based on the Claimant’s failure to meet the criteria of Article 26(1) of

the ECT.

The Tribunal decides that the Claimant is not an “Investor” in accordance with
Article 1(7)(a)(i) and Article 26 of the ECT. The Claimant has not established
jurisdiction ratione personae, and the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear

the Claimant’s ECT claims against the Republic of Turkey.
Costs

In making its decision on the allocation of the Parties’ costs, the Tribunal is bound
by Articles 43-45 of the SCC Rules, entitled “Costs of the Arbitration.” In
accordance with Article 43(3) of the SCC Rules, the Tribunal has requested the
SCC Board “to finally determine the Costs of the Arbitration.” The Board having
made this determination, and now in accordance with Article 43(4), the Tribunal

includes in Section V the Costs of the Arbitration.
Article 43(5) of the SCC provides:

Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Arbitral Tribunal shall, at the
request of a party, apportion the Costs of the Arbitration between the
parties, having regard to the outcome of the case and other relevant

circumstances.

198.

The Respondent has argued that applying the SCC, as well as the provisions of the
Swedish Arbitration Act (the “SAA”), leads to the identical result that costs should
follow the event, and that the Claimant should therefore reimburse the Respondent
for both costs of the arbitration and the other costs it has incurred in defending itself

(principally lawyer and expert fees).!°°
Section 37 of the SAA provides, in part:

The parties shall be jointly and severally liable to pay reasonable
compensation to the arbitrators for work and expenses. However, where
the arbitrators have stated in the award that they lack jurisdiction to
determine the dispute, the party that did not request arbitration shall be
liable to make payment only insofar as required due to special
circumstances.

The Respondent argues that no such special circumstances exist in the present case,

and that the Respondent should therefore not be liable to make payment.!*°

The Claimant in turn submits that Section 37 of the SAA is not mandatory, and that
even if it were, it does not lead to the result that the Respondent argues.'*’ The

Claimant notes how one of the Respondent’s own legal authorities provides:

“[The SAA] is based on the principle of party autonomy, also with respect
to compensation to the arbitrators. (...) Such issues may be expressly
governed by the parties in an arbitration clause or, e.g., through reference

to arbitration rules that contain provisions in this respect.”!°*

The Tribunal is in agreement with this statement. The requirements of Section 37

of the SAA are not mandatory, though the Tribunal may seek “guidance” from the

provisions of the SAA, as it did in its Award on Security for Costs and

Bifurcation.'”? The Parties have consented to the application of the SCC Rules.

In deciding how to allocate the payment of the costs of the arbitration, the Tribunal
shall therefore have “regard to the outcome of the case and other relevant

circumstances,” in accordance with Article 43(5) of the SCC Rules.

Article 44 of the SCC Rules further provides rules regarding the “Costs incurred by

a party.” Article 44 states:

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal may in the
final award upon the request of a party, order one party to pay any
reasonable costs incurred by another party, including costs for legal
representation, having regard to the outcome of the case and other

relevant circumstances.

Thus, Article 44 provides the same standard for determining the “Costs incurred by
a party,” as is provided in Article 43(5) regarding the “Costs of the Arbitration.”
The Tribunal may also have regard to the outcome of the case and other relevant

circumstances.

The outcome of the case is in favour of the Respondent, as the Tribunal has decided
that it does not have jurisdiction ratione personae. The Tribunal recognises that in
such circumstances it may be ordinary or typical to order an award of costs for the
Respondent. However, the Tribunal should also look to other relevant

circumstances before making an award in favour of one party.

In the present case the Tribunal considers that there exists a relevant circumstance
that persuades the Tribunal that costs should not follow the outcome of the case.
This case involved a novel issue of interpretation of the ECT. The Tribunal is aware
that the core issue does not appear to have been the subject of arbitral consideration
or authority (at least in a published decision by another international tribunal or

body). The issues raised were novel, and they were certainly arguable. The Tribunal

does not consider that the Claimant has treaty shopped or committed an abuse of
process in bringing his claims before this Tribunal. The questions presented before
the Tribunal involved complex and often conflated issues of international and
domestic law. The Tribunal believes that the resolution of these issues sheds much
needed light on previously unresolved or unanswered questions of law. Hence,
despite the Tribunal finding that it lacks jurisdiction, the Tribunal believes it fair in
the circumstances that each Party should bear its own costs, and further share the

costs of conducting this arbitration.

The Tribunal notes that even if Section 37 of the SAA was to be mandatorily
applied, the relevant circumstances outlined above are also capable of constituting

“special circumstances.” Thus, the result would be the same.

Therefore, the Tribunal decides that it shall not make an order for costs in favour of
the Respondent. Relating to the “Costs of the Arbitration,” under Article 43 of the
SCC Rules, the Parties shall each share half of the costs. Relating to the “Costs

incurred by a party,” each Party shall bear its own costs.
