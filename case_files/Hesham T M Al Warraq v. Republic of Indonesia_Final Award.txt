IU. PROCEDURAL HISTORY.-

10.

The arbitration commenced by means of a Notice of Arbitration filed on 1
August 2011, pursuant to Article 17(2) of the the Agreement on Promotion,
Protection and Guarantee of Investments among Member States of the
Organisation of the Islamic Conference (the “OIC Agreement”) and Article 3
of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International
Trade Law as revised in 2010 (the “UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules”). Article 17
(2) of the OIC Agreement reads as follows:

“2. Arbitration

a) If the two parties to the dispute do not reach an agreement as a result of their resort
to conciliation, or if the conciliator is unable to issue his report within the prescribed
period, or if the two parties do not accept the solutions proposed therein, then each
party has the right to resort to the Arbitration Tribunal for a final decision on the

dispute.

b

=

The arbitration procedure begins with a notification by the party requesting the
arbitration to the other party to the dispute, clearly explaining the nature of the
dispute and the name of the arbitrator he has appointed. The other party must, within
sixly days from the date on which such notification was given, inform the party
requesting arbitration of the name of the arbitrator appointed by him. The two
avbitrators are to choose, within sixty days from the date on which the last of them
was appointed arbitrator, an umpire who shall have a casting vote in case of equality
of voles. If the second party does net appoint an arbitrator, or if the two arbitrators
do not agree on the appointment of an Umpire within the prescribed time, either party
may request the Secretary General to complete the composition of the Arbitral
Tribunal.

(©) The Arbitration Tribunal shall hold its first meeting at the time and place specified by
the Unipire. Thereafter the Tribunal will decide on the venue and time of its meetings

as well as other matters pertaining to its functions.

(a) The decisions of the Arbitration Tribumal shall be final and cannot be contested. They
are binding on both parties who must respect and implement them, They shall have
the force of judicial decisions. The contracting parties are under an obligation to
implement them in their territory, no matter whether it be a party to the dispute or
not and irrespective of whether the investor against whom the decision was passed is
one of its nationals or residents or not, as if it were a final and enforceable decision

of its national courts,”

In the Notice of Arbitration the Claimant appointed Mr. Michael Hwang as
arbitrator. By letter dated 25 November 2011 the Respondent appointed Mr. Fali
S, Nariman as arbitrator in these proceedings, subject to the Respondent’s

objections to locus standi/jurisdiction and on conditions as set out in said letter.

Subject to the Respondent’s 25 November 2011 letter, the Parties by agreement
appointed Mr. Bernardo M. Cremades as presiding arbitrator.

On 10 January 2012, the Respondent filed its Summary of the Respondent’s
Application Containing Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility
of Claims,

On 10 January 2012 the Tribunal circulated a draft Terms of Engagement
inviting the Parties’ comments, The Respondent in its email dated 13 January
2012 requested insertion of a confidentiality provision and clarification as to the
fact that the submission to arbitration is in the first place governed by the Parties’
agreement on 25 November 2011, and that the first phase (determination as to
whether or not there is any jurisdiction over the merits) must result in an award.
In its email of 18 January 2012 the Claimant questioned the request for inclusion
of confidentiality provision, asserting the appropriateness of transparency in
investment treaty arbitrations. In its email of 19 January 2012, the Respondent
stated that Singapore, as the seat of the arbitration, treats the duty of
confidentiality as an overriding obligation, The Claimant in its email of the same
date continued to manifest its objection to the inclusion of the provision and
invited the Respondent to make an application “including to set out the authority
supporting the proposition that there is an applicable duty of confidence that is
relevant to investment treaty arbitration seated in Singapore or an explanation

to justify that there ought to be one for the purposes of this case”.

The Tribunal circulated its Provisional Timetable for Submission of Documents
on 13 January 2012. In its email of 17 January 2012 the Claimant proposed to
modify submission dates delaying submission date by one week and requesting
confirmation of agreement from the Respondent. On 19 January 2012, the
Respondent confirmed its agreement in general with slight modifications, these
being accepted by the Claimant by return of email with the request that the
Tribunal formally circulate the Production Order for submissions. The Tribunal

circulated the Final Provisional Timetable on 19 January 2012.

20,

On 25 January 2012 the Tribunal circulated the draft Terms of Engagement with
the inclusion of the Parties’ suggestions, with the exception of the confidentiality
provision, and requesting signature of the final page by the Parties and return by
fax or email. Addressing the issue of the confidentiality provision, it stated that
such would require further briefing and ultimately a ruling by the Tribunal and
was therefore not appropriate to incorporate in the Terms of Engagement. Leave

thus was granted for the Respondent to submit a confidentiality application.

The Respondent sent an email on 29 January 2012 confirming the legal opinion
iv regard to the application of confidentiality and privacy in the present
arbitration and voicing its surprise that the Claimant contests application of this
duty when both the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules of 2010 and the law of
Singapore provide for the application of a duty of confidentiality to these
arbitration proceedings, further stating that the only exceptions to this duty under
the above-mentioned Arbitration Rules are set out in Article 34(5) in relation to
the publication of the award, Furthermore, the Respondent rejected that these
exceptions apply and should consequently not be considered further. The
Respondent concluded that “in the event that the Claimant breaches its
obligations as to confidentiality and privacy the Respondent reserves its right to

take action, either before this Tribunal or elsewhere, to protect its legal rights”.

In its email dated 31 January 2012 the Tribunal took note that the Respondent
was simply stating its position rather than making an application for an

immediate order, and it invited the Claimant to its comments.

Pursuant to the Claimant’s email of 31 January 2012, the Tribunal recirculated
the Terms of Engagement with the corrections of two typographical errors on 1
February 2012. The Terms of Engagement were returned by email duly signed
by the Claimant on 1 February 2012 and by the Respondent on 8 February 2012.
The Tribunal circulated a signed copy of the Terms of Engagement on &
February 2012.

By email dated 9 February 2012 the Claimant refuted the Respondent’s
assertions as to the confidentiality provision in the UNCITRAL Arbitration

9

Rules of 2010 or that the law of Singapore provided for such. The Claimant
consequently did not accept the existence of any such duty of confidentiality or
that it should apply to the proceedings and stated that it “wil/ vigorously contest

any application by the Respondent for a confidentiality order”.

The Tribunal by emails dated 10 and 17 February 2012, and with regard to the
provision of funds, circulated a document entitled “SIAC Deposit Terms” with
the request for the signature of the Parties and members of the Tribunal in
confirmation of their agreement to the terins therein. A reminder to the Parties
was sent on 24 February 2012 expressing its concern at the non-return of said

signed document and urgently requested that they proceed to do so.

In accordance with the Timetable for the Provision of Documents dated 19
January 2012, the Respondent filed its Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction
and Admissibility of the Claim on 13 February 2012.

By email dated 1 March 2012 the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of signed
original copies of the SIAC Deposit Terms document. It also referred to
logistical matters with regard to the 28 April 2012 hearing and requested
confirmation of the Parties that arrangements have been settled. The Claimant
undertook the organization and confirmed all arrangements in its email of 4 April

2012.

On 7 March 2012, the Claimant filed its Response to the Respondent’s
Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility of Claims.

On 29 March 2012, the Respondent filed its Rebuttal to the Claimant’s Response

to the Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility of Claims.

In its email of 16 April 2012, the Tribunal requested of the Parties an agenda
proposal and list of attendees to be submitted by 20 April 2012.

The Claimant filed its Rebuttal to the Respondent’s Preliminary Objections to
Jurisdiction and Admissibility of Claims on 20 April 2012.

Singapore, starting 28 April 2012.

Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility of the Claim (“Partial
Award”).

On 31 July 2012, the Tribunal circulated a provisional schedule for document

submission for the merits phase.

On 28 September 2012, the Claimant submitted his first request for production
of docuinents. On | October 2012, the Respondent replied that the request for
production of documents could be made following the first exchange of
submissions. The Tribunal notified the Parties by email on 8 October 2012 that
documents can be requested at any time as provided for in Paragraph 8(a) of the
Provisional Timetable No. 2.

The Respondent in its letter of 16 October 2012 requested that the Claimant be
more specific as to particular documents citing the Tribunal’s email of 8 October
2008: “...should be for specific documents or classes of documents that are

adequately defined by date, origin, recipient, purpose and the like”.

By email dated 17 October 2012, the Tribunal reminded the Parties that the
negotiations should be carried out in good faith and that “if expects a co-

operative attitude between the Parties in relation to document production”.

confirming the Respondent’s agreement to the same. By separate email dated 8
November 2012, the Respondent confirmed its agreement, On the same date, the

Tribunal confirmed the Parties’ agreement for an extension.

By letter dated 9 November 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the
Respondent was actively seeking the extradition of Mr. Al-Warrag. The
Claimant requested the Tribunal to issue an interim order and an order to restrain

Respondent from taking further action.

In its email of 10 November 2012 the Tribunal desisted from making immediate
ex-parte Order. The Tribunal suggested that the Claimant presents an application
to the Tribunal under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (and 16
and 17 of the OIC Agreement).

The Respondent in its email of 10 November 2012 stated that it was unaware of
proceedings for an extradition order and requested that the Claimant provide
documentary evidence in support of its allegations made (in the letter dated 9

November 2012),
On 13 November 2012, the Claimant submitted its request for interim measures.

The Tribunal in its email of 14 November 2012 invited the Respondent’s
comments on the Claimant’s request to be filed by 21 November 2012. The
Respondent replied by email dated 24 November 2012 that the Tribunal had no
jurisdiction to issue such an order. The Claimant in its email of 26 November
2012 requested that the Tribunal ignore the Respondent’s reply since it was
submitted three days after the given deadline.

regarding the request for extradition of the Claimant and other documents
relating thereto, in accordance with paragraph 30(2) of the Tribunal's Decision

on Interim Measures dated 28 November 2012.

The Claimant in its email of 3 January 2013 requested the balance of documents
in support of the extradition order, as per the Interim Measures Decision of 28

November 2012.

Furthermore, on 9 January 2013, the Claimant requested from the Tribunal an
extension for the term of payment of funds (SGD 1,000,000.00) due to the
difficulties Mr. al-Warraq was having to access his funds, which was granted by

the Tribunal.

On 23 January 2013, the Claimant sent another letter reiterating the difficulty of
accessing the funds and indicating availability of same within a 2 to 3 week
period. The Tribunal in its email of 25 January 2013 reminded the Parties that
the original request for funds was made on 18 September 2012 and the deadline
had passed. The Tribunal granted another extension until 15 February 2013.

The Respondent indicated in its email of 26 January 2013 that it would not make
any further payments in this matter and that it had been instructed not to perform
any further work on this matter “wil and unless [it] has received full payment

Jrom the Claimant”.

On 19 March 2013, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that he had made the
payment of SGD 1,000,000.00 and that he would supply proof of transfer.

By email of 22 March 2013 the Tribunal invited the Parties to discuss and

provide their proposals for a revised procedural timetable.

On 4 April 2013, the Respondent notified the Tribunal of the new procedural
schedule in agreement with the Claimant as to dates, and informing the Tribunal
that the Parties had failed to agree on the hearing venue. The Respondent
requested that the hearing (the “Final Hearing”) be held in Singapore. The
Claimant requested that London be fixed as the hearing venue. The Respondent

requested the ruling of the Tribunal in this regard.

The Tribunal in its letter of 8 April 2013 confirmed the new procedural schedule
and agreed to the “logic” of holding the bearing in Singapore. The Tribunal
proposed that the hearing be in February 2014 and requested the Parties’

indications of expected timings.

The Respondent in its letter of 9 April 2013 confirmed its availability for
February 2014 provided that the venue was indeed to be Singapore. The
Claimant on 12 April 2013 agreed to the hearing in February 2014 commencing

Pursuant to the Parties’ agreement, the Respondent filed its Defence and

Counterclaim on 15 July 2013.

The Claimant filed its Reply and Defence to Counterclaim, on 15 November
2013.

On 5 December 2013, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that on 4 Deceinber
2013, he was contacted by a local police officer and asked to attend a meeting,
which he did, this time accompanied by his lawyer. The Claimant also informed
the Tribunal that at the meeting, he was informed that the Saudi office of Interpol
in Riyadh had, on 22 October 2013, received a written request from Indonesia
relating to him, and the Claimant was again required to provide a formal
statement. The Claimant requested the Tribunal to order that the Respondent
desist from making any request of any Saudi agency with regard to the Claimant,
and to produce the aforementioned letter of 22 October 2013.

On 6 December 2013 the Respondent replied by denying allegations and the
existence of the 22 October 2013 letter. The Respondent also asserted that the
Claimant’s letter was “another fictional attempt to prejudice this Tribunal
against the Respondent” and that “the client assures us that there has been no

Surther attempt to seek extradition of Claimant in more than a year”.

On 12 December 2013 the Tribunal informed the Parties that it cannot order the
Respondent to desist from its pursuit of the Claimant, at the same time ordering
the Respondent to disclose its official communications to Saudi Arabia dated 22

October 2013 referred to by the Claimant.

By letter dated 21 January 2014, the Claimant requested from the Tribunal the
postponement of the Final Hearing scheduled on 10 March 2014, due to serious
health issues and stress suffered by the Claimant. The Claimant informed the
Tribunal that due to his psychological problems suffered because of the case, he
is no fit state to attend the hearing either “via video-conference or otherwise”.

On 22 January 2014, the Respondent objected to the Claimant’s request to

15

64,

66.

67.

postpone the Final Hearing. On the same date the Tribunal requested that the
Claimant provide a copy of his medical report, On 3 February 2014, the Claimant
provided the Tribunal with a copy of his medical report dated 2 February 2014
and signed by Dr. Ayman Arnous asserting that the Claimant should take further
medical advice to reassess whether he was fit to attend the Final Hearing in view
of “his morbid physical health” (which included diabetes, hypertension,
bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis and hypercholesterolemia), his recent loss of
appetite, insomnia, difficulty of concentration, and distress and anxiety which

would be exacerbated by cross-examination at the Final Hearing,

On 5 February 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision not to
postpone the Final Hearing on the grounds of the Claimant’s health, but that his
“medical condition is a matter that the Tribunal will be conscious of during the

hearing”.

The Respondent filed its Rejoinder and Rebuttal to Defence to Counterclaim on
11 February 2014.

The Claimant wrote to the Tribunal on 19 February 2014 expressing
disappointment at the decision to hold the Final Hearing given “Mr al-Warraq’s
fragility”, and contrary to doctor’s orders. The Claimant insisted again on the
point on being “concerned by Mr al-Warraq’s ability throughout the hearing to
give us, his counsel, full instructions, and to withstand cross-examination
without serious consequences for his physical and mental well-being”. The
Claimant also stated the serious issues with respect to his inability to attend the
hearing a) because the actions of Indonesia at INTERPOL had prevented Mr al-
Wartaq travelling to Singapore and b) on account of “his health issues, resulting

from the pressures of dealing with the situation over the last six years”.

On 27 February 2014, the Claimant provided the Tribunal with a letter from
INTERPOL signed by the General Counsel Joél Sollier dated 27 February 2014
setting forth that the Red Notices were temporarily blocked for the duration of
the travel period,

The Claimant filed his pre-hearing brief on 6 March 2014.

A ten-day hearing took place on 10 March 2014. On the first day of the Final
Hearing, the Claimant reiterated his objections to the Tribunal’s decision
concerning the attendance of the Claimant at the Final Hearing, and made his
submissions on the subject during the Hearing. The Parties had the opportunity

to make extensive submissions on the subject.

The hearings were declared closed on 20 March 2014.

On 16 June 2014, the Parties filed their Post-Hearing briefs, as well as their

submissions on costs,

By letter dated 4 September 2014 the Claimant made additional unsolicited
submissions regarding a criminal trial in Indonesia, and advised of the progress
of legal proceedings in Switzerland relating to funds held in an account at
Dresdner Bank established for participating in the AMA (as explained below),
The Respondent answered on S September 2014 objecting to the Claimant’s
letier. The Tribunal acknowledged receipt of this correspondence, and reminded
the Parties that the hearings had been declared closed on 20 March 2014. By
letter dated $5 November 2014 the Claimant sought permission to submit as a
new exhibit in the arbitration pursuant to Articles 17 and 27 of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules the judgment of the Commercial Court of the Canton of Zurich
dated 1 September 2014 relating to the funds held in the Dresdner Bank account.
The Tribunal advised that Parties on 17 November 2014 that ‘at this stage of the
proceedings the additional evidence...-will not be necessary’. The Tribunal was
aware of the issues related to the Swiss proceedings from other evidence in the
arbitration, and considers that the Swiss judgment is not of sufficient materiality
(particularly considering the lack of probative value of any findings made by the
Swiss court in this arbitration) to justify further evidence (with the necessary
tight of contradiction of the Respondent) significantly after closure of the

hearing.

In 2000, Mr al-Warraq became a shareholder in Chinkara Capital Limited
(“Chinkara”), a Bahamian company, which had been established in 1999 by
Messieurs Rafat Ali Rizvi and Tommy Kim Tong Bhum. Chinkara was renamed
First Gulf Asia Holdings Limited (“FGAH”) in early 2005. FGAH’s main areas
of activity included the development and execution of turnaround strategies for

distressed banks.

Starting from carly 2000, through FGAH, the Claimant began to acquire shares
in three banks, PT Bank CIC, Tbk (“CIC”), PT Bank Pilko, Tbk (“Pikko”), and,
PT Danpac, Tbk (“Danpae”) (jointly, the “Pre-merger Banks”). The Claimant
also acquired and held directly 141,538,462 shares in Bank Century (“Bank
Century”).

CIC had been established by the Tantular family in 1989. CIC had undergone an
Initial Public Offering in June 1997 and had been advised on this by Mr Rizvi.
Mtr Rizvi had personally acquired some shares in CIC. At some point after the
IPO, two of the Quantum Group of Funds (managed by Soros Fund
Management), each of which held roughly 10% of the shares in CIC, were
looking to dispose of their interests in CIC. The Claimant through FGAH
acquired these shares from the Quantum funds. FGAH’s total shareholding in
CIC was approximately 19.8%. In addition to acquiring shares, FGAH also
appointed Aziz Rajkotwala as CEO of CIC, and Mr Rajkotwala assembled a

management team to run CIC,

FGAH acquired 65% of Pikko from the Texmaco group of companies when it
defaulted on a loan, which had been secured by a pledge over the shares in Pikko.
FGAH deposited USD 12,000,000, which was converted into shares in Bank
Pikko in 2001. In or around the fourth quarter of 2001 FGAG acquired a 55%

shareholding in Danpac.

78.

Following the acquisition of Danpac, the Pre-merger Banks began preparing to
merge. The merger process took about 18 months and was approved by both
Bank Indonesia and the Jakarta Stock Exchange, and on 15 December 2004 the

Pre-merger Banks merged to form Bank Century.

In 2006, the Claimant was appointed to the Board of Commissioners which
oversaw the Board of Directors, and became a member of the Remuneration and

Nomination Committee,

B. Bank Indonesia

79.

80.

81.

82.

 

Bank Indonesia was established as the central bank of Indonesia in 19531. Its
initial functions have been amended slightly since that time, through Law No.
13 of 1968 concerning Central Bank, and Law No. 23 of 1999 concerning Bank
Indonesia as amended by Law No. 3 of 2004, Government Regulation as
Replacement of Law No. 2 of 2008 and Law No. 6 of 2009 on the enactment of
Law No, 2 of 2008.

Pursuant to Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 13/3/PBI/2011 on Status and
Follow-Up of Bank Supervision, there are three different degrees of supervision
available to the central bank. These are normal supervision, intensive

supervision and special surveillance.

Bank Indonesia requires banks to have a specified capital adequacy ratio
(“CAR”) of 8% from time to time based on risk weighted assets, It most recently
required this through Regulation No. 10/15/PBI/2008.

In carrying out its regulatory and supervisory functions, Bank Indonesia
undertakes both direct and indirect supervision of banks. Direct supervision, also
known as on-site supervision, involves auditing banks to assess their financial
position and compliance with regulatory requirements, as well as making

recommendations. Indirect supervision, or off-site supervision, consists of

84.

analysing banks’ reports and reviewing whether banks have complied with
relevant regulations. Under Regulation No. 8/12/PBI/2006, all banks should
prepare and submit Commercial Bank Monthly Reports (LBBU) to Bank
Indonesia”, The reports cover conventional banking activities e.g, data regarding
the bank’s minimum capital requirements and detailed information about items
listed on the bank’s balance sheet. Submissions of the data are timed so that
banks are required to provide information to Bank Indonesia on a weekly basis.
This allows the central bank to be kept fully informed of each bank’s position
and operations, It therefore assists Bank Indonesia in carrying out its supervisory

function.

Bank Indonesia would place a bank under special surveillance if, in its opinion,
that bank is facing issues that threaten the continuation of its banking activities.
Banks could be subjected to special surveillance for a naximum period of three
inonths. Where a bank was under special surveillance, Bank Indonesia could
require that the bank and/or the shareholders inject capital into the bank within

a certain timeframe.

If a bank under special surveillance was suspected to have a systemic impact,
then Bank Indonesia was required to report the saine to the Indonesia Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the “IDIC”) or the Republic of Indonesia’s Deposit
Insurance Agency (the “LPS”) and to the authorized institution that is the
‘Coordination Committee’, which in Bank Century’s case was the Financial
Sector Stability Committee (the “IKSSK”), as established under Perpu No. 4 of
2004. A Perpu, is a regulation in lieu of law, issued by the President in an
emergency situation when there is not sufficient time for it to go through the
Parliamentary process normally required for the promulgation of a new law. A
Perpu has the same force as a law, although possibly for a shorter duration, If
not subsequently adopted by the Parliament into a Law (Undang Undang), the

Perpu would cease to have the force of law, thereafter,> but would not nullify

2 Christopher Laursen’s Report, para. 102.

3 The Clainant contends (but the Respandent disputes the contention) that the Perpu has no effect at all if
it is rejected by Parliament. The Tribunal is of the view that a Perpu— and particularly Perpu 4 of 2004 -~
took effect and was not deprived of legal effect because it was not subsequently adopted into law by
Parliament.

20

anything done under it up to the date of it not being adopted into law by
Parliament. The institution then had to decide whether or not the bank has a

systemic impact.

IDIC is an independent body and is a separate legal entity to Bank Indonesia.
Pursuant to Law No. 24 of 2004, “JDIC manages and administers the Deposit

Guarantee Program’,

Ifthe authorised institution decides that a bank has a systemic impact, then Bank
Indonesia would require it to set out the necessary action for the bank and its
shareholders to take for recovery or rescue of the bank, if one of the following

criteria was met:

1) Capital adequacy ration (‘CAR”) of the bank was less than 2%;
2) _ statutory reserve ratio in Rupiah was less than 0%; or

3) the special surveillance period of three months had been exceeded*.

If the authorised institution determined that the bank did not have a systemic
impact but nonetheless satisfied one of the above three criteria, Bank Indonesia
was then required to notify IDIC. Bank Indonesia would then request IDIC to

decide whether or not it would take action to rescue the relevant bank.

C. Bank Century’s Bailout

88.

On 21 Noveinber 2008, Bank Century was placed under the administration of
the LPS. The decision was made pursuant to Perpu No. 4 of 2008 and Law No,
24 of 2004. As at 21 November 2008, FGAH held approximately 2707 million
shares in Bank Century and the Claimant personally held 141,538,462 shares in
Bank Century®,

89, The Claimant and his partners provided at least five separate letters of
commitment between October of 2005 and November of 20087 in the

circumstances following.

90. According to the Claimant, and as explained by Mr Rizvi in his witness
statement®, in September 2008" Bank Indonesia started pressing the Claimant
and Mr Rizvi to sign a letter of commitment drafted by Bank Indonesia, The two
men were unwilling to sign the letter proposed by Bank Indonesia. The draft
letter contained a provision that the Claimant and Mr Rizvi would “Sertle by
cash all the bank’s securities as mentioned in Assets Management Agreement
(“AMA”), as attached, particularly which will due [sic] in 2008...".0n 4
September 2008" Mr Rizvi and the Claimant proposed to amend the letter, to
the effect that they would take steps to:

i “work out a resolution of the ... Foreign Currency Securities and
other assets of the Bank” by 31 March 2009 with a view to removing the
assets from the balance sheet and replacing them with cash or assets

acceptable to Bank Indonesia; and

(ii) “seek to bring in new investors ... [to] control not less than 51%

of Century”, again by no later than 31 March 2009.

91. Bank Indonesia refused to accept the alteration proposed and insisted that the
Claimant and Mr Rizvi sign a letter incorporating the terms as proposed by Bank

Indonesia.

92. On 15 October 2008 a letter of commitment (the “October LOC”)"!, was duly
signed by Mr Rizvi, the Claimant and Mr Tantular on behalf of FGAH, Outlook
Investment Ltd and PT Century Mega Investindo. The October LOC provided

as follows:

By November of 2008, the world was facing an economic crisis, and major banks
and other large corporate entities faced problems in the United States, the UK
and elsewhere. Depositors were beginning to withdraw funds from some banks,
including Bank Century, because its liquidity problem had become known when
it requested short-term liquidity support from Bank Indonesia on 14, 17 and 18
of November, 20088.

Moreover, on 13 October, 2008, the Government issued Perpu No. 2 of 2008",
authorizing Bank Indonesia to approve short term loans to ailing banks under
less rigid circumstances than previously. As an implementation of the Perpu,
Bank Indonesia on 30 October 2008, issued Bank Indonesia Regulation (PBI
No, 10/26/PBI/2008'° which introduced the mechanism for granting short-term
loans. On 14 November 2008, further amendments were applied to this
instrument through PBI No. 10/30/PBI/2008", providing a further reduction in

the requirements for obtaining the short-term loans.

On 20-21 November 2008, Bank Century was given a short-term loan by Bank
Indonesia and placed under Bank Indonesia’s “special surveillance” regime. A
second letter of commitment was signed by Mr. Rizvi and Mr. Tantular on 16

Jakarta, 16 November 2008

On 20-21 November 2008, a meeting of the KSSK was held, which comprised
representatives from the Republic of Indonesia’s Finance Ministry, Bank
Indonesia and LPS. The KSSK meeting was chaired by the then Finance
Minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati (“Sri Mulyani”). The Claimant submits that
Mr. Tantular, but not Mr. Rizvi and himself, who had been informed about that
meeting and had been asked to attend at Bank Indonesia’s offices. Since 2005
Bank Century had been enrolled in the Deposit Insurance scheme. The
Undertakings provided by shareholder and management of Bank Century to LPS
and signed by the Claimant himself on 5 December 2005 read as follows:

“LETTER OF STATEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER LEGAL ENTITY
(For Bank which is Indonesian Legal Entity)

This Letter of Statement is made on the date of 5 December, 2005.”

As at July 2009, the total funds injected by Bank Indonesia stood at IDR 6.76
trillion (about USD 676-700 million).

The Claimant submits that there were riots in the streets and bitter infighting
between several of the parties in the ruling coalition. The Indonesian press
reported allegations that the bailout funds, some of which had reputedly
disappeared from Bank Century after being injected, had been used to fund the
2009 presidential election campaign. The Indonesian House of Representatives
established a special inquiry committee tasked with looking into all aspects of
the Bank Century bailout from the provision of the original short-term loan

27

facility and the actual decision to bail out Bank Century through to the use to
which the bailout funds were put. The Claimant also submits that the Respondent

has confirmed as much.'*

100. In this regard, it had been reported in mid-February 2010 (in the local
newspapers) that seven of the nine political factions represented on the special
inquiry committee had declared the bailout “illegal and mired in corruption”,
with only the two remaining parties represented deeming the bailout to have been
legitimate19, [It was also reported that in March 2010, the House of
Representatives’ special committee ruled that there were violations in the Bank
Century bailout which should be investigated by the law enforcement agencies,
and a special House of Representatives’ teain was subsequently formed to

monitor the investigations into the Bank Century bailout.

101. It was further reported that the Chairman ‘of the Corruption Eradication
Commnuission (“KPK”) had expressed his view that Vice-President Boediono
was “involved in the Bank Century bailout scandal ”20. The inquiry by the House
of Representatives’ committee was not the only enquiry spawned by the bailout.
There were two others — one by the Supreme Audit Agency (“BPK”), an ongoing
enquiry by the KPK and another by the police.

102. Indonesia’s KPK began its investigation in the immediate aftermath of the
bailout, amidst rumors of the bailout monies having been diverted into President

Yudhoyono’s 2009 election campaign.

formally occupy an executive position at Bank Century. However, Mr. Tantular
controlled the Bank Century Board of Directors, of which there were five
members, all of whom had been appointed by him and all of whom were deemed
to be “Fit and Proper” by Bank Indonesia, having passed Bank Indonesia’s Fit

and Proper Test.

104, Mr. Tantular also appointed all members of the Board of Commissioners other
than Mr. Al-Warrag. Mr. Tantular’s sister, Theresia Dewi Tantular, was the head
of the Bank Notes Division and another Tantular appointee, Sunartono, headed

the International Division.

105. On 14 December 2009, Bank of Indonesia issued a press release naming Mr.
Tantular as Bank Century’s majority shareholder: “in anticipation of several
items that required the signatures of the owners of majority shareholders of
Century Bank in the event of a bank closure or a takeover by the Deposit

Jnsurance Corporation (DIC)” 21

106, Following the bailout of Bank Century on 21 November 2008, Bank Indonesia
reported Mr. Tantular, the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi to the National Police for
banking irregularities, and on 25 November 2008, Mr. Tantular was arrested,

The charges were as follows:

1) Charges against Mr. Tantular related to the channeling of customer funds
from Bank Century by (i) inducing customers to purchase financial
products from Antaboga, a company owned by Mr. Tantular and various
of his relatives; and (ii) issuing letters of credit to companies connected

with Mr. Tantular and his relatives without declaring his interest.

2) Charges centering on non-performance of financing commitments and

other alleged breaches of prudent banking practices.

Opening fraudulent bank accounts by bypassing the appropriate customer

identification and verification procedures; and

Releasing collateral deposits made by debtors in connection with letters
of Credit issued by Bank Century before any liabilities associated with
those Letters had been extinguished.

E, The Investigation and Prosecution of the Claimant

108. Following the bailout on 21 November 2008, Bank Indonesia lodged a

complaining with the National Police about the banking irregularities of Mr.

Tantular and the Claimant, and on 25 November 2008, Mr. Tantular was

arrested. The charges against Mr. Tantular were as follows:

)

Charges against Mr. Tantular related to the channeling of customer funds
from Bank Century by (i) inducing customers to purchase financial
products from Antaboga, a company owned by Mr. Tantular and various
of his relatives; and (ii) issuing letters of credit to companies connected
with Mr. Tantular and his relatives without declaring his interest (the

“Embezzlement Charges”); and

30

2) Charges centering on non-performance of financing commitments and
other alleged breaches of prudent banking practices (the
“Mismanagement Charges”); (the Embezzlement Charges and the
Mismanagement Charges being jointly the “Bank Century Charges”).

109. The Claimant states that the investigation of Bank Century Charges was led at
the outset by two people, Lt General Susno Duadji, the Head of the Criminal
Division of the Republic of Indonesia Police Headquarters, and Lt General
Edmon Ilyas, the Director II/Special Economic Criminal Division of the
Republic of Indonesia Police Headquarters. Warrants were issued for the arrest
of the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi on or about 4 December 2008, The Claimant also
states that in or around May 2009, the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi instructed an
Indonesian law professor, Professor Indriyanto, to make contact with one of the
police officers leading the investigation and, as a consequence Professor

Indriyanto met Lt. Gen. Ilyas in late May 2009,

110. The Claimant states that, at that meeting, Lt. Gen. Ilyas solicited a bribe of USD
300,000 in order to discontinue the proceedings against Mr. Tantular and Mr.
Rizvi. In early June 2009, Mr. Rizvi wrote to Lt General Duadji® to offer his
and Mr. al-Warraq’s co-operation in the investigation into the Embezzlement
Charges but received no reply. On 9 June 2009, the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi were

111. According to Article 82 of INTERPOL’s Rules on the Processing of Data “Ked
Notices are published at the request of a National Central Bureau (NCB) in
order to seek the location of a wanted person and his/her detention, arrest or
restriction of movement for the purpose of extradition, surrender, or similar

lawful action”.

112. The Claimant submits that Kingsley Napley LLP, a law firm in the UK, was
instructed by the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi to deal with and remove the criminal
allegations against them (the Claimant and Mr, Tantular), and the law firm was
successful in getting the information relating to them removed from the Interpol

website, once the political nature of the charges had been made clear to Interpol.

113. The Claimant further submits that he and Mr. Rizvi instructed Kingsley Napley
to write to the Attorney General’s Office (“AGO”), requesting a meeting at
which the defence of the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi to the criminal allegations
could be explained®>, When no response was received, the Claimant and Mr.
Rizvi instructed RISC Management Ltd and its Operations Manager, Mr. Ernest
Pallett, to make contact with the AGO to see whether there was any possibility
of opening up a line of communication. Mr. Pallett states in his first witness
statement given in Mr. Rizvi’s ICSID arbitration”®, that he travelled to Jakarta in
order to set up a meeting with the AGO. Local contacts put him in touch with a
British banking consultant, who in turn put him in contact with an Indonesian
Law Firm, SH & Associates, who had connections with the AGO. A meeting
was arranged with the AGO on 7 June 2010.

114. Mr. Pallett explains at paragraphs 12 and 13 of his first witness statement (given
in Mr. Rizvi’s arbitration), that he was put into contact with SH & Associates,
with whom he had a meeting. According to Mr. Pallett, he was informed by Mr.
Sahnun of SH & Associates at that meeting that he “had met with the Attorney
General himself the day before and also with Mr Amari, the Deputy of the

McBride, para. $

34

Attorney General and the man ultimately responsible for the prosecution.” Mr,
Pallett was then informed that the Attorney General would be prepared to reach
a setilement, privately and confidentially, with no details to be leaked to the
press, following which the Red Notices would be lifted. Mr. Sahnun also
confirmed that the Attorney General and SH & Associates would ensure the
matter was cleared through parliament and had “lined up some ministers who
were aware of the potential issues and agreed that the matter must be sorted

out”.

115. The Claimant submits that details of the 7 June 2010 meeting with the Deputy
Attorney General are set out in the first as well as the second witness statements
given by Mr. Pallett in Mr. Rizvi’s ICSID arbitration”. Present at that meeting
were the Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Amari, and MS Desi Meutia, the
investigating officer in charge of the case, amongst others. Mr. Pallett states that,
at that meeting he was informed that the settlement figure the Respondent was
seeking was approximately IDR 3.1 trillion, although this was subject to change.
When Mr. Pallett asked Mr. Amari and MS Meutia to explain how the figures
(MS Meutia had quoted from a report in her possession) had been arrived at and
why they had not yet been finalised, they replied that the figures quoted for the
alleged offences of money laundering had not as yet been submitted. Mr, Pallett
was also repeatedly told that only Mr. Sahnun of SH & Associates could resolve
the matter and the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi would have to instruct SH &

Associates to represent them in their dealings with the AGO.

116, The Claimant then submits that following his meeting with Mr. Amari, Mr.
Pallett returned to the offices of SH & Associates who were confident that “the
maiter could all be settled quickly with the involvement of the Attorney General
and his Deputy, Mr Amari.” Mr. Pallett was then told that, in order to secure the
deal, SH & Associates required an immediate payment of USD 2 million, USD
1 million of which would be for “networking”, a USD 500,000 engagement fee
and USD 500,000 for professional fees, together with a USD 2 million success

fee payable once the case was settled and closed. When Mr. Pallett enquired

7 Exhibit ERP 1, paras. 14 - 16 and Exhibit EEP2, paras. 9 - 20.

 

 

 

35

about the USD 1 million “networking fee”, he was told that this sum would be
“distributed amongst the various agencies and departments that needed to ‘close
off’ on any settlement deal.” Mr. Pallet then sought clarification that such sum
was payable to various governmental officials involved and was not part of the
formal settlement figure. He was told that this was indeed the case and that the
monies should be paid directly to SH & Associates, who would then themselves
arrange for the various payments to be made. Mr. Pallett states, at paragraph 18
of his first witness statement given in Mr. Rizvi’s ICSID arbitration that, “if was
clear to [him] that this networking fee as described constituted at least a
{facilitation payment’ (that is a payment made to an official in the course of their
normal duties) to the officials involved in resolving this matter which is of course

a bribe”,

117. The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s actions in this regard confirmed the
Claimant’s belief that he would not be afforded a fair trial in Indonesia and that
he could not therefore participate in the proceedings. Kingsley Napley were
therefore instructed by the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi to bring this matter to the
attention of the Respondent’s law enforcement agencies, which they did, but to
no avail. Letters were sent to the Attorney General, the Central Jakarta District
Court and the panel of Judges hearing the criminal case against the Claimant and
Mr. Rizvi. A formal complaint was made to the Special Task Force on Judicial

Corruption”’, No response to any of these letters was ever received.

118. In response to Mr. Rizvi’s account of these bribery attempts at soliciting bribes
in his ICSID arbitration, the Respondent submits that it was Mr. Pallett who
sought to bribe the AGO on the Claimant’s and Mr. Rizvi’s behalf. The
Respondent asserts that Mr, Rizvi and the Claimant “sent unqualified
representatives first to seek to bribe the prosecutor at the Attorney General’s
office after [Mr Rizvi] had failed to enlist the support of known corrupt police
officials to try to have {his] conviction dismissed informally”, In support of its

28 Exhibit EEPI.

allegation of bribery by Mr. Pallett on the Claimant’s behalf, the Respondent
relies on the Affidavit of Ms Firdaus dated 17 October 2011.

119. On | September 2009 Mr, Rizvi wrote again to Lt General Duadji, on behalf of
himself and the Claimant*!, However, according to the Claimant no response
was received. In late November 2009, Lt General Duadji was removed from his
position and suspended from active duty on allegations of corruption in relation
to both his investigation of Bank Century Charges and to another unrelated
investigation. The allegations included permitting the unwarranted release of
USD 18 million from Bank Century’s frozen account to one of Bank Century’s
largest depositors*”, According to press reports Lt General Duadji was, on or
around 24 March 2011, convicted of corruption, given a three and a half year jail

sentence and ordered to repay IDR 4 billion in assets”.

120, The Claimant further submits (relying on press report) that, Lt General Duadji
came openly into conflict with the KPK when it transpired that he had led a
conspiracy aimed at discrediting the KPK which involved the arrest of two
deputy KPK chairmen on trumped-up charges on the basis of fabricated evidence

in order to deflect their attention from him*4,

12

. The Claimant submits that in March 2010, Lt General Duadji alleged that Lt
General flyas himself, along with another police general, had acted as a case
broker in a money laundering and tax evasion case*’, The Respondent had
described Lt. Gen. Duadji and Lt, Gen. Ilyas as “known corrupt police officials”
in its Rule 41(5) application®®. On 30 December 2009 the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi
also wrote to Vice-President Boediono*? and the then Attorney General, Bpk,

Hendarman Supandji*® to explain their innocence and offer their assistance in

recovering Bank Century funds embezzled by Mr. Tantular and his family. But

no reply was received from either of them.

122. Another of the investigations spawned by the Bank Century bailout is that of the
KPK. Indonesia’s KPK — established by President Yudhoyono as part of his anti-
corruption platform — began its investigation in the immediate aftermath of the
bailout, amidst rumors of the bailout monies having been diverted into President
Yudhoyono’s 2009 election campaign. Over the years the investigation has
attracted a lot of press attention, and has resulted in a number of Bank Indonesia
and other government officials being named as possible suspects in the Bank

Century case.

123. Moreover, in December 2009, the AGO commenced a criminal investigation
against Mr. Rizvi and Mr. al-Warraq in connection with the collapse of Bank

Century and in particular in relation to the Mismanagement Charges.

124. ‘The primary indictment dated 2 March 2010, is a charge under Art. 2(1) of the
Corruption Act that the Claimant and Mr, Rizvi committed acts aimed at
enriching themselves which could create loss to the state finances. The total loss
the two men were alleged to have caused was IRP 3,115,889 billion (USD
286,650,550). This offence was based on the transactions for the procurement,
placement and/or exchange of CIC’s foreign currency securities by

Chinkara/FGAH,

125, Further as a subsidiary indictment”, there was a second Corruption Act charge,
pursuant to which it was alleged that the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi had misused
their positions in Bank Century to cause Bank Century to conduct improper
banking practices which had caused loss to Bank Century. There was also a
further charge under Law Number 15 of 2002 concerning the Criminal Offence
of Money Laundering (the “Money Laundering Act”) in relation to alleged
illegal placements or transfers of money. The Money Laundering Act charge

26
® This second indictment was referred to in the Jakarta District Court Ruling of December 2010
(specifically p.5 of the Judgement).

38

concerned the USD 52 million National Australian Bank Limited notes, which
had allegedly been illegally transferred from Bank Century to FGAH. As part of
this offence, it was alleged that the USD 52 million National Australian Limited

notes had originally been exchanged for criminal proceeds.

F. The Claimant’s Trial in Absentia

126. The Prosecutor issued three documents, which the Respondent alleges were
Court Summonses requiring the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi to attend the District

Court for their trial on three different dates as follows:

127. The first document issued is dated 12 March 2010 and allegedly required the
Claimant and Mr. Rizvi to attend the District Court on 18 March 2010. The first

V. THE PARTIES’ POSITION.-

THE CLAIMANT’S STATUS AS AN INVESTOR

51

A. The Respondent

142,

143,

te

144.

The Respondent refers to paragraph 113 of the Tribunal's Partial Award, dated
21 June 2012. The Tribunal reserved for consideration: “the determination af its
jurisdiction to the merits phase of the arbitration, where the questions to be
determined include whether the Claimant can establish its status as an ‘investor’

within the meaning of the OIC Agreement”.

At paragraph 90 of the Award, the Tribunal made the following finding: “The
nationality requirements of an ‘investor’ are set out in Article 1 of the OIC
Agreement. The Claimant alleges its investment was made through FGAH as
well as by the Claimant personally. FGAH is a company registered in the
Bahamas. The Bahamas are not a Contracting Party to the OIC Agreement,
and so FGAH is not an ‘investor’ for the purposes of the OIC Agreement.”

(emphasis added)

The Tribunal went on to observe (at paragraph 91) that the Respondent “. . . has
called into question whether the Claimant personally held shares in Bank
Century at the time it was placed in administration ... The Tribunal requires
further evidence and submissions on the Claimant's condition as an ‘investor’
for the purposes of the OIC Agreement, and this question is accordingly reserved

until the merits phase of this arbitration,”

(i) The Claimant did not hold any shares in Bank Century in his own right

145,

146.

According to the Respondent, the Claimant acknowledges that the Award
requires him to “establish his status as an “investor” within the meaning of the
OIC Agreement,""!

However, the Claimant has failed to produce any proof that he did own this
shareholding, despite the Respondent's request for him to do so in its Request

for Discovery. In lieu of any such proof, the Claimant has submitied a single

 

+) Paragraph S of the Claimant’s Statement of Claim.

52

sheet of heavily redacted paper purporting to be a letter from ABN AMRO
Private Banking, That letter (Exhibit C41) supposedly indicates his portfolio of
shares in Bank Century. In fact it does nothing of the sort. Aside from the highly
questionable nature of this exhibit which bears no address and does not even
indicate from which country it was issued, nor in what currency the “price” per
share is expressed — the one bit of information not redacted there is false, The
Claitnant cannot have held any shares in Bank Century in his own naine. He was

never listed in the share register, or with the stock exchange.

147. The Respondent submits that while FGAH held 2,706,800,937 shares,
amounting to 9.55% of the bank's equity capital, the Claimant did not hold a
single share on his own behalf. According to the Respondent there is a very smal]
holding by ABN AMRO (502 shares), but on behalf of someone else entirely,

not the Claimant’,

148. The Respondent also submits that at the time of the alleged “expropriation,”
therefore, the Claimant did not own a single share in Bank Century. That alone
should suffice to dismiss the Claimant's entire case as falling outside the scope

of the OIC Agreement.

149. The Respondent also argues that even if the Claimant did own the shares he
claims to have held, that interest would be a miniscule percentage (0.2 percent)
of the capital of Bank Century before the bailout. If the Claimant could somehow
establish that he was an investor in Bank Century in his own right, which clearly
is not the case, the Tribunal would still need to consider whether the holding of
1/500n of the equity of a publicly listed bank is sufficient to give an “investor"
the right to bring arbitration under the OIC Agreement, and whether his alleged
loss would warrant consideration by an arbitral tribunal at all. This is particularly
so where the value of Bank Century at the time of the bailout was a negative
figure, due primarily to the embezzlement of its assets by the Claimant himself

together with his partners,

ii)

‘The Tribunal has already ruled that the Claimant cannot seek damages for
shares owned by FGAH.

150. The Respondent submits that the Claimant fails to recognise that for the OIC

151,

152.

153.

Agreement to apply, he must first meet the definition of “Jnvestor” and then
show that the dispute concerning the “jnvestment” is covered by the OIC
Agreement. The Clainiant argues that he is an “investor” because “indirect”
investments ought to be covered by the OIC Agreement, despite the Tribunal's
ruling in its Award. The Respondent argues that the Claimant misses the point.
The first question is whether the Claimant qualifies as an investor under the OIC
Agreement, The OIC Agreement makes it plain in Article 1(6) that the national
of the Contracting Party must own the capital and invest it in the territory of the

host state.

According to the Respondent, in the present case the Claimant fails to do so
because FGAH has a distinct legal personality from that of the Claimant. The
Clainiant argues that he has standing to bring the claim because he is a
shareholder in FGAH. However, the definition of investor under the OIC

Agreement provides otherwise. Article 1(6) defines "investor" as:

“The Government of any contracting party or natural corporate person,
who is a national of a contracting party and who owns the capital and

invests it in the territory of another contracting party.” (emphasis added)

FGAH is a Bahamas Company. The Bahamas are not a party to the OIC
Agreement, nor a member of the OIC. The Tribunal has already found that
FGAH is not an Investor for the purposes of the OIC Agreement. It is simply not
open to the Claimant to claim personal ownership of the shares in Bank Century
held by FGAH.

The Respondent submits that he Claimant’s assertion that he personally owns
Bank Century shares through his minority ownership in FGAH goes against the
fundamental and now universal principle that the legal personality of a company

is separate and distinct from that of its shareholders.

34

154. The Respondent also submits that FGAH does not have /ocus standi under the

treaty. The Claimant can only qualify as an investor for any shareholding he

himself owns in Bank Century.

(iii) ~The OIC Agreement only protects investors that comply with Article 9 of the OIC
Agreement

155.

156.

157.

The Respondent argues that even if the Claimant were somehow to be deemed
io meet the definition of an investor in Article 1(6), it is clear that the OIC
Agreement protects only those investors that comply with the obligations set out
in Article 9 of the OIC Agreeinent, which the Claimant clearly does not. Article
9 of the OIC Agreement stipulates:

“The investor shall be bound by the laws and regulations in force in the
host state and shall refrain from all acts that may disturb public order or
morals or that may be prejudicial to the public interest, He is also to
refrain from exercising restrictive practices and from trying to achieve

gains through unlawful means,”

The Respondent submits that the OIC Agreement imposes an on-going duty on
the investor to observe the host state laws and to refrain from acts that may
disturb public order or morals or that may be prejudicial to the public interest.
Further, the investor must also refrain from trying te achieve gains through

untavful means.

The Respondent also submits that Article 9 goes beyond the typical stipulation
found in BITs, i.¢,, to observe the host state law when making the investment.
First, the obligation to comply with the host state law is on the investor, and not
on the investment. Second, the duty to comply with the host state law is not
restricted to the time of making the investment, but is on-going throughout the
time the investor operates in the host state. Third, the obligation is not limited
solely to compliance with domestic law, it requires that the investor refrain from
even attempting acts that may disturb public order or morals or conduct that may

55

be prejudicial to public interest. Additionally, he should also refrain from even
trying to achieve gains through unlawful means. It is plain that Article 9 requires
the investor to observe an enhanced code of conduct throughout the life of his

investment in the host state.

158.

%

Moreover, it is well-established that investments that violate host state law are
not afforded treaty protection and the Tribunal is said to lack jurisdiction over
the subject matter (ratione materiae) of such a claim. If the Claimant does not
comply with Article 9, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate his claims

(ratione personae).

159, The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s breach of Article 9 is indisputable
in this case. He perpetrated criininal offences in relation to his role in Bank
Century, for which he was duly convicted by a competent court, The final and
binding judgment of the Indonesian Court confirms that he acted in violation of
Indonesian criininal laws. It goes without saying that this constituted highly
immoral, as well as illegal, conduct and that the Claimant achieved gains through

unlawful means,

160. The Respondent submits that the Court’s finding of illegality, and indeed
immorality, is binding on this Tribunal. The position under hidonesian law is a
question of fact. The Court interprets and enforces the Indonesian criminal law
applicable to the Claimant’s conduct. According to the Respondent, in the
present case the Tribunal is faced with a finding — not merely an allegation — of
criminality, by the competent court. It must accept the Court’s judgment as

dispositive of the Claimant’s criminality and immorality in this case.

{iv) The “clean hands” doctrine renders the Claimant’s claims inadmissible

161. According to the Respondent, even if the Tribunal should otherwise find it has
jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims the fact that he comes to this Tribunal

with “unclean hands” renders his claims inadmissible. The Indonesian Court

56

162.

163.

164.

convicted the Claimant of theft, corruption and money laundering. All these

offences were perpetrated in relation to the alleged investment.

The Respondent argues that in the context of investment arbitration the doctrine
of “clean hands” has also been affirmed as a general principle regarding claims

tainted by corruption”? and operates as a ground of inadmissibility™.

Moreover, investment treaty tribunals, as upholders of public international law,
should be viewed as having inherent or incidental jurisdiction to find that claims

are inadmissible for abuses of process or other serious forms of misconduct.

The Respondent submits that in the present case, the integrity of the Tribunal
requires that a convicted criminal and a fugitive from justice cannot be allowed
to abuse the OIC Agreement by submitting a claim that is tainted by his own
fraud and corruption. The “clean hands” doctrine operates as a. procedural bar to

his claims, This Tribunal should render them inadmissible.

B. The Claimant

165.

#RLA 27,

(i) The Claimant clearly has an investment within the meaning of the OIC Agreement
The Claimant submits that the OIC Agreement Article” 1(4) defines capital as
“fajll assets ... owned by a contracting party to this Agreement or by its
nationals, whether a natural person or a corporate body and present in the
territories of another contracting party whether these were transferred to or
earned in it ...”. In turn, Article 1(5) of the OIC Agreement defines investment
as the “employment of capital in one of the permissible fields in the territories
of a contracting party with a view to achieving a profitable return, or the transfer

of capital to a contracting party for the same purpose, in accordance with this

Agreement”.

By the ordinary meaning of the text of Article 1(4), the OIC Agreement requires
that the “assets” be “owned by a contracting party to this Agreement or by its
nationals, whether a natural person or a corporate body...” The Claimant
submits that nothing in the OIC Agreement - in Article 1(4), Article 1(5), or
elsewhere - requires the natural person directly to own the capital or to hold title
in his own name. According to the Claimant, this reading is consistent with every
investment tribunal’s answer to the question of whether indirect investments are
protected”, as well as with the vast majority of legal commentaries on the
subject’”,

According to the Claimant the decided practice of arbitral tribunals is to construe
the definitions of “capital” and “investments” broadly to include indirect
investments - e.g. where the owner of an investment invests through an
interposed company. The Claimant submits that by the ordinary meaning of the
text of the OIC Agreement, as well as the practice of arbitral tribunals, the

Claimant has a qualifying investment under the OIC Agreement.

(ii) The Claimant Qualifies as an Investor within the Meaning of the OIC Agreement.

168.

According to the Claimant, he made an “investmenf” within the meaning of the
OIC Agreement when he invested indirectly through FGAH. The Claimant
submits that the Respondent’ s circular rebuttal that the Claimant must first “meet
the definition of investor” before showing that the “investment is covered by the
OIC Agreement” is illogical because the definition of “investor” in Article 1(6)
relies upon the definitions of “capital” and “investment” in Articles 1(4) and

1(5), respectively.

 

46 CLA259 (“The assertion that a claimant lacks standing because an investment is only an indirect

investment has been made numerous times, but never with any success.” See also CLAV31 ff 136-37;
CLA132 Ff 123-24.

“7 See, e.g. CLA183 at 65; CLA184 p. 475; CLA 185 at 66-161,

“3 See Reply and Defence to Counterclaim, §| 25.

38

169. The Claimant submits that the definition of investor in the OIC Agreement,
Article 1(6) is “the Government of any contracting party or natural corporate
person, who is a national of a contracting party and who owns the capital and
invests it in the territory of another contracting party.” According to the
Claimant he meets the criteria for an “investor” within the meaning of the OIC

Agreement.
{a) The Claimant is a National of a Contracting Party,
170. The Claimant was born in Cairo, Egypt and became a Saudi citizen on 15
December 1985. Saudi Arabia signed the OIC Agreement on 23 September 1983
and ratified it on 17 September 1984*°. The Respondent does not, and cannot,

dispute that the Claimant is a National of a Contracting Party.

(b) The Claimant “Owns the Capital” and “Invests it in the Territory”

of Indonesia, a Contracting Party.

171.

Article 1(4)’s definition of “capital” is broad and includes “all assets ... owned
by a contracting party to this Agreement or its nationals... and shall include
the net profits accruing from such assets and the undivided shares and intangible
rights.” The Claimant submits that “distinct legal personality” is not the
applicable test for whether indirect ownership of assets is covered by the OIC
Agreement, Rather, the well-settled principle that “indirect investment” is
protected by contemporary investinent treaties instructs the analysis, as well as
the longstanding practice of arbitral tribunals. The Claimant is an “investor”
within the meaning of the OIC Agreement. The Claimant claims that he has
demonstrated that he “owns the capital” in Bank Century through his 100 per
cent legal ownership of FGAH First Gulf Asia Holdings, as well as his
ownership of shares through his personal shareholding through ABN Amro.

(iii) The Claimant’s Investment is not entitled to the pretections afforded by the OIC
Agreement

172.

173,

174,

 

The Respondent argues that the Claimant should be denied the protections
afforded to investors by the OIC Agreement, as a result of his alleged failure to
comply with Article 9 which requires hiin to “refrain ‘from trying to achieve

50 and as a result of his “unclean hands”®'. The

Claimant has reiterated in his Second Witness Statement’, that he has not
committed any illegal acts, either in relation to his investinent, or at all, and the
findings of the Jakarta Criminal Court in this regard cannot be regarded as just

or reliable by this Tribunal.

The Claimant also refers to the First and Second Witness Statements of Mr.
Pallett in which he confirms that the Attomey General’s investigation was
tainted by an attempt by the Attorney General’s office to extract a bribe, via the
medium of Indra, Sahnun & Lubis, $.H. & Associates (“Indra Sahnun &
Lubis”), from the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi, in exchange for which the criminal

charges would be dropped.

According to the Claimant, it was this unsuccessful bribery attempt, together
with the media witch-hunt to which the Claimant was subjected by the
Respondent and the threat of the death penalty that prevented the Claimant and
Mr. Rizvi from appearing at their trial. As the Claimant explains, “/h/ad there
been a system of justice in Indonesia that was not tainted by corruption and
political influence, I would have had the chance to rebut the outrageous
allegations made against me. But in reality, neither I nor Mr Rizvi stood a
chance of having a fair hearing in Indonesia”®, He and Mr. Rizvi were
ultimately convicted i# absentia without ever having had the opportunity

properly to defend themselves.

175. It is the Claimant’s submission, based on Mr. Rizvi’s First Witness Statement,
that none of the charges against the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi withstand the
slightest scrutiny®’. The Claimant submits that the Jakarta Central District
Criminal Court’s verdict was manifestly unjust on the basis of the evidence
before it and indicative of a predetermination on the part of the judges. The
reality, which must have been apparent to all the Respondent’s agencies
concerned, is that the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi were victims, not perpetrators, The
real loss to Bank Century was caused by the Respondent’s central bank’s
negligent failures, in respect of its own supervisory obligations and Mr.

Tantular’s fraudulent activities,

176. The Claimant submits that, in the circumstances, neither Article 9 of the OIC
Agreement, nor the clean hands doctrine is relevant and, contrary to the

Respondent’s contention, the Claimant’s claims are therefore admissible.

2. THE CLAIMANT’S RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 10 OF THE OIC AGREEMENT

A. The Claimant’s contentions

@ The Respondent violated Article 142) of the ICCPR when it prejudged the
Claimant’s guilt

177. The Claimant argues that by virtue of Article 31.3(c) of the Vienna Convention

on the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”), the basic rights and guarantees accorded to

the Claimant by virtue of Article 10.1 of the OIC Agreement must be interpreted

to include basic international law norms and rights. By virtue of its obligation

under Article 10.1 of the OIC Agreement to abstain from undertaking any

measures that directly or indirectly deprive the Claimant of his “basi¢ rights”,

the Respondent was duty bound to respect the Claimant’s right to be presumed

innocent™, when it decided to:

1) attribute the alleged “State loss” to the Claimant and his business partner;

 

+4 Witness Statement of Rafat Ali Rizvi, 3 December 2012. fff 51, 103 and 108-109.
+5 Final Hearing, Transcript, Day 1, Monday 10 March 2014, p 202 lines 8-203

61

2) subject the Claimant and his business partner to criminal proceedings with
the objective of depriving them of their property through asset forfeiture

and/or criminal fines; and,

3) pursue the Claimant’s assets and those of his business partner through the
application of the mechanisms for mutual legal assistance in criminal

matters.

178. The Claimant submits that it is inherent in the “basic rights” envisaged by Article
10.1 of the OIC Agreement, that any of these measures must be taken with due
respect for the Claimant’s right to be treated in accordance with the fair trial
principles, including the right to be presumed innocent. The right to be presumed
innocent until proved guilty is a principle that conditions the treatment to which
an accused person is subjected throughout the period of criminal investigations
and trial proceedings, up to and including the end of the final appeal. Article
14(2) of the ICCPR provides that “everyone charged with a criminal offence
shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to
law, 5

179. The UN Human Rights Cominittee, the body that supervises compliance with
the ICCPR, made that clear in its General Comment 13 of 198457;

“No guilt can be presumed until the charge has been proved beyond
reasonable doubt. Further, the presumption of innocence implies a right
to be treated in aceordance with this principle. It is, therefore, a duty for

all public authorities to refrain from prejudging the outcome of a trial”.

180. The Claimant submits that according to the jurisprudence of the various
international human rights bodies, the presumption of innocence is violated

whenever public authorities or representatives of government make public

56 CLA254.
ST CLA226.

 

62

statements, which prejudge the outcome of particular criminal proceedings. As

the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR”) stated*®:

“The vight to presumption of innocence ... requires that the State should
not convict an individual informally or emit an opinion in public that
contributes to forming public opinion, while the criminal responsibility of

that individual has not been proved.” ®

181. The [ACHR has also held that the police’s public exhibition of a suspect as the
perpetrator of a crisne constituted a violation of that right. The European Court
of Human Rights (“ECHR”), applying Article 6(2) of the European Convention
on Human Rights®', held that statements made by a minister of interior holding
up a suspect as an instigator of a murder constituted a violation of the right to
the presumption of innocence. The ECHR has also held it to be a violation for
a speaker of parliament to make statements amounting to declarations of a
suspect’s guilt and for a minister of the interior, in a magazine interview, to
make statements leaving the public with the impression that the suspect was part
of a criminal organization™, Likewise, the African Commission on Human and
People’s Rights, applying Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter on Human and
People’s Rights®, has found it to be a violation of the right for government
representatives, including a state military administrator and a special adviser to
the president, publicly to pronounce suspects guilty before and during trial®, and
for government representatives to organise media campaigns declaring suspects

guilty.”

182. This jurisprudence stems from the fact that the presumption of innocence is one
of the most established fundamental rights of individuals recognised by
customary international law. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of

1948, states in its Article 11 that:

“fejveryone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed

innocent until proved guilty according to law”.

183, As stated by the Human Rights Committee, this duty to refrain from prejudging
a trial applies to all public officials, including and especially public prosecutors
and other law enforcement authorities, The need for strong; independent and
impartial prosecutorial authorities for the effective maintenance of the rule of
jaw and human rights standards cannot be sufficiently emphasized. So much so,
that according to Paragraph 12 of the United Nations’ Guidelines on the Role of
Prosecutors (1990)”,

“fpjrosecutors shall, in accordance with the law, perform their duties
fairly, consistently and expeditiously, and respect and protect human
dignity and uphold human rights, thus contributing to ensuring due

process and the smooth functioning of the criminal justice system.”

184, [n this light, the Claimant submits that by making adverse public comments
about him, the Respondent failed to respect his right to be presumed innocent
and has therefore acted in violation of the basic rights under Article 10.1 of the
OIC Agreement. Specifically, the Claimant submits that his right to be presumed
innocent was compromised by the conduct and publicly expressed views of

Indonesian public officials as for instance in:

Jakarta Globe 8 January 2010: Deputy Attorney General Marwan Effendy:
“We have learned that Hesham alone took Rp 3 trillion, We're ready [to

goto court] but we still need official loss estimates from state auditors and
the money laundering charge provided by the police,” ... “Once they finish

their job, the case is ready for trial, We hope it will happen this month.”?!

According to the Claimant there is nothing wrong with the Deputy Attorney
General stating that he suspects the Claimant of having stolen the said amount.
Nor is there anything wrong in saying that Claimant has been charged with such
a crime, However, it was wrong of Deputy Attorney General Marwan Effendy
publicly to declare that the Claimant actually stole Rp 3 trillion. That is
prejudicial to the Claimant and a clear violation of the Claimant’s Article 10.1

basic right to be presumed innocent.

A few weeks later, Deputy Attorney General Marwan Effendy trampled again

on the Claimant’s right to be presumed innocent when as reported in the press:

Jakarta Globe 21 January 2010: Deputy Attorney General Marwan
Effendy: “Their case will be handed to the Central Jakarta Prosecutor's
Office because we have concluded the investigation,” .. “Hesham and

Rafat have inflicted state losses of Rp 3.115 trillion [8336 million}.””

Again, the affirmative way in which Deputy Attorney General Marwan Effendy
chose to convey his view in this matter is reflective of the lack of respect afforded
to Mr. al- Warraq’s fundamental right to be presumed innocent until proven

guilty.

It is clear therefore that the Respondent’s behaviour in this case violated the
Claimant’s right to be presumed innocent, That behavior is incompatible with
the obligations that the Respondent was required to observe in relation to the

Claimant under the OIC Agreement and under general international law.

(ii) The Claimant’s right to a fair trial under Article 14 of the ICCPR is further
violated in light of the Respondent’s nefarious motive for his prosecution and
conviction

189.

190,

(a) Improper objective of the AGO

The Claimant claims that the criminal proceedings against him were unfair and
contrary to the most fundamental elementary procedural guarantees. It has
always been the Claimant’s contention that the criminal proceedings against him
were not based on genuine law enforcement inotives, but were designed to
pursue his assets and those of his business partner in an attempt to mitigate the
public outcry about the unlawful bailout of Bank Century. The Claimant submits
that all the evidence shows that from the outset the only motive behind his
prosecution, including the selection of the charges and the use of the mechanisms
for mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, was the Respondent’s desire to
pursue assets. The Respondent’s pursuit of the Claimant in satisfaction of this

nefarious motive contravenes the OIC Agreement.

The Respondent’s true motive for its pursuit of the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi is
explained in details in an article that appeared in the Jakarta Globe on 8 January
2010:

“Indonesian AGO Eager to Try Century Suspects as It Pursues Stolen

spokesman Didiek Darmanto said. Hesham and Ravat, who have fled
abroad, are charged with embezzling assets worth trillions of rupiah from
Bank Century, which received a Rp 6.7 trillion ($710 million) government
bailout after it was taken over by the Deposit Insurance Agency (LPS) in

November 2008. Prosecutors have pledged to seek a trial in absentia for
both men later this month, but Didiek would not provide the date. “We are
waiting for the estimated state losses fram officials at the Supreme Audit
Agency and the case files from police. Those documents will be combined
with a request for a trial in absentia,” Didiek said. Marwan Effendy, the
AGO’s deputy for special crimes, said earlier this week that prosecutors
were determined to bring the case to court before the end of the month.
“We have learned that Hesham alone took Rp 3 trillion. We're ready [to
goto court] but we still need official loss estimates from state auditors and
the money laundering charge provided by the police,” Marwan said.
“Once they finish their job, the case is ready for tial. We hope it will

happen this month.”

The AGO said earlier it had contacted authorities in Switzerland and Hong
Kong to seck assistance in retrieving stolen assets worth more than $1
billion allegedly embezzled by the two suspects, A joint team of officials
from various state agencies has asked the Swiss authorities to help return
cash collateral worth $220 million held at Dresdner Bank of Switzerland,
and has sought help from authorities in Hong Kong to trace and seize

assets belonging to Hesham and Ravat.

The two are alleged to have stashed $650 million in stolen Bank Century
assets in Standard Chartered Bank and another $388.8 million in ING
Bank in Hong Kong.

The joint team, led by Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, includes
officials fiom the AGO, the National Police, the Financial Transaction
Report and Analysis Center (PPATK), the central bank, the Capital

Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance and the new management of

191, The Claimant submits that the bluntness and candour displayed by the AGO in
this article reveals the Respondent’s true motive behind the criminal proceedings
against the Claimant, explains why certain charges were selected and why the

Respondent was equally selective in its use of international conventions.

(b) THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE IMPROPER MOTIVE BY THE JAKARTA
Districr COURT FURTHER VIOLATED THE CLAIMANT’S MINIMUM
GUARANTEE TO BE PRESUMED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

192. According to the Claimant this is consistent with the approach adopted by the
Jakarta District Criminal Court in its Interlocutory Judgment of 10 June 2010,
when it took the decision to proceed with the trial i7 absentia”. It is clear from
the following considerations listed in the Interlocutory Judgment that the Court
was also of the view that the objective of the criminal proceedings was the

confiscation of the Claimant’s and Mr. Rizvi’s assets:

“Taking inte account, whereas under Chapter IV (Articles 43 through
Article) Such referred UN convention contains international cooperation,
extradition, transfer of people who have been pronounced, legal assistance
cooperation, the delivery of for punishment, law enforcement cooperation,
the delivery for punishment, law enforcement cooperation, joint
investigations, special investigation techniques, and Chapter V (Article
51-Article 59) is a partnership with comprehensive approach in dealing
with corruption involving two or more countries, including involving
foreign nationals on the procedure to track down and confiscate and
return the corruption assets of a state while the he/she take benefit at the
state's victim... Taking into account, whereas Indonesia is one state that
Joined the UN Convention of 2003 on UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION
AGAINST CORRUPTION (UNCAC) is the consequence that national laws
and rights owed by Indonesia as a state party to the UN-protected so that
wherever and wherever corruptor run away and hide iis assets it can be

tracked and their property confiscated””>,

This confirms that the objective of the criminal proceedings against the Claimant
was to obtain a judgment that would enable Indonesia to trace and seize the
Claimant’s assets. Pursuing his assets — as opposed to the ends of justice — has
always been seen by the Indonesian authorities as the means to recover the state’s
alleged losses that resulted from the unlawful decision to bail out Bank Century.
Alleging that the Claimant committed a crime and going after his assets was thus
a convenient way to inanage the political scandal that erupted over the misuse of

the Respondent’s taxpayers’ money when Bank Century was bailed out”.
(c) Corroboration by the Respondent’s counsel

The Claimant submits that it is in evidence in the proceedings that the
Respondent made an extradition request to Saudi Arabia on 29 October 200977
based on the United Nations Convention on Transitional Crime (“UNTOC”Y*”.
It is also in evidence that the Respondent is not committed to the pursuit of its

extradition request and has not seriously pursued the Claimant’s extradition,

The Claimant claims that the Respondent has consistently used the available
international mechanisms in a very selective way, motivated as it is with only
the seizure of the Claimant’s assets. The dismissiveness of fundamental rights
displayed in the above exchanges reflects the fact that the Respondent requested
the Claimant’s extradition while knowing all the time that its intention was to try
the Claimant in absentia. As a matter of fact, according to the Jakarta Globe
article of 8 January 2010, within a very short period after the extradition request,
the AGO was already quoted as saying that “/p/rosecutors have pledged to seek
a frial in absentia for both men later this month, but Didiek would not provide

the date,”®°

196. The Claimant submits that the Respondent has never considered the Claimant’s
extradition necessary or relevant because the Respondent’s objective throughout
was to obtain his conviction in absentia in order to pursue his assets through the

mechanisms for mutual assistance in criminal matters.
(d) “Intelligent” charges

197, The Claimant claims that despite charging him with corruption and money
laundering, it has never been contended nor suggested by the AGO that there
had been any payments to state officials*' or payments made to procure
advantages to the Claimant or Mr. Rizvi or any third party**, Similarly, it has
nowhere been suggested that the Claimant acquired securities with criminal

proceeds*®*, To understand why these charges were selected, one must refer back

purpose of

concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property or of helping any person who is involved in the
commission of the predicate offence to evade the legal consequences of his ar her action;

(ii) The concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement or ownership

(b) Subject to the basic concepts of its legal system:

70

to the fact that the charges and the use of the mechanisms for mutual legal
assistance in criminal matters were motivated by the Respondent’s sole objective
of retrieving assets. According to the Claimant, this was the most effective way

for the Respondent to:

1) try the Claimant in absentia under a special Indonesian anti-corruption

law;

2) prevent the Claimant from being represented by counsel during his trial in
absentia pursuant to Indonesian Supreme Court Circular No. 6 of 1988
(SEMA 6/1988”);

3) exclude the Claimant from the right to appeal under the same SEMA
6/1988, once convicted in absentia for corruption, unless he appears in

person;

4) likewise, exclude the Claimant from the right to file a petition for judicial
review unless he appears in person under the same SEMA 6/1988,
including under the modification introduced by Supreme Court Circular
No. 1 of 2012 (“SEMA 1/2012”); and therefore,

5) use the corruption conviction so obtained as the basis to trace and seize the
Claimant’s assets worldwide pursuant to the United Nations Convention
Against Corruption (the “UNCAC”) and the UNTOC™,

(i) The acquisition, possession or use of property, knowing, at the time of receipt, that such property is the

The Claimant states that, as soon as the conviction was obtained, the Attorney
General was quoted as confirming the sole objective of the criminal proceedings

against the Claimant. Jakarta Globe on 17 December 2010 stated that:

“The guilty verdict against two foreign co-owners of Bank Century has
provided the Attorney General’s Office with the means to recover their

stolen assets from overseas banks, the attorney general said on Friday.

 

“We will inform authorities in Hong Kong about the verdict so that they
can continue with the process of asset recavery,” Attorney General Basrief

Arief told reporters in Jakarta.” 142

Unless one overlooks the fact that the Respondent’s objective throughout has
been to dispossess the Claimant of his assets, the Respondent’s reliance on the

UNTOC seems remarkable, if not erroneous.

To start with, the facts of the case do not meet the threshold test for the
application of the UNTOC, According to UNTOC Article 2(a), “organized
criminal group’ shail mean a structured group of three or more persons, existing
Jor a period of time and acting in concert with the aim of committing one or more
serious crimes or offences established in accordance with this Convention, in
order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit.”
Despite invoking the UNTOC, the Respondent never alleged, nor provided
evidence, that the Claimant was part of “a sfructured group of three or more
persons, existing for a period of time and acting in concert with the aim of
committing one or more serious crimes or offences.” However, it was convenient
for the Respondent to invoke this convention on account of its provisions

concerning confiscation and seizure of assets,

criminal offence under the domestic law of the State where it is committed and would be a criminal
offence under the domestic law of the State Party implementing or applying this article had it been
committed there; (0.2).

201.

Furthermore, the Claimant submits that the charges of corruption and money
laundering were chosen by the AGO and endorsed by the Jakarta District
Criminal Court because these charges meant that a conviction in absentia could
be obtained, which was de facto non-appealable, and which could be relied upon
to seize the Claimant’s assets worldwide. The Respondent’s measures, seen
cumulatively and in light of their effect on the Claimant, do not pass the test of

being bona fide.

(ii) The Respondent deprived the Claimant of his basic rights in the manner in which
it condneted its criminal investigation of the Claimant

(a) Failure to inform the Claimant

202. The Claimant submits that it is a basic right of any individual to be informed

203.

 

properly and in a timely fashion of the nature and cause of the charges against
him. The Respondent has failed to respect this basic right. In these circumstances
it is impossible to conclude that criminal proceedings against the Claimant were
compliant with the Respondent's obligations under Article 10.1 of the OIC
Agreement, as interpreted in accordance with principle of systemic integration
articulated in Article 31.3(c) of the VCLT.

The principle of systemic integration requires the Tribunal to take Article
14(3)(a) ICCPR and other governing norms of international law into account
when interpreting and applying Article 10.1 of the OIC Agreement, Article
14(3)(a) of the ICCPR provides in this respect that, in the determination of any
criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled “fo be informed promptly
and in detail in a language which he understands of the nature and cause of the
charge against him.” According to the Human Rights Committee, the right to be
informed in Article 14(3)(a) “applies to all cases of criminal charges, including

“ea

those of persons not in detention,” and the term “‘prompily’ requires that
information is given in the manner described as soon as the charge is firsi made

by a competent authority”**, The Committee made it clear that “¢his right must

2 Fd,

arise when in the course of an investigation a court or an authority of the
prosecution decides to take pracedural steps against a person suspected of a
crime or publicly names him as such. The specific requirements of subparagraph
3(a) may be met by stating the charge either orally or in writing, provided that
the information indicates both the law and the alleged facts on which it is

based”’*’,

In the view of the Committee, the duty to inform also means that “detailed
information about the charges against the accused must not be provided
immediately upon arrest, but with the beginning of the preliminary investigation
or the setting of some other hearing which gives rise to a clear official suspicion

against the accused”,

Although according to evidence tendered by the Respondent, examination of a
suspect is mandatory under Indonesian law®, it is in evidence that the Claimant
was never examined by either the Indonesian police or the AGO, Having regard
to the nature and purpose of the OIC Agreement (i.e. to promote foreign
investment), it was all the more important to respect the Claimant’s basic rights,
as required by its Article 10.1. The Respondent was obliged to take reasonable
steps to ensure that the Claimant was properly and in a timely manner informed
that he was the subject of a criminal investigation and why. Foreign investors
are unlikely to reside in the host state. As a consequence, the good faith principle
inherent in the pacta sunt servanda principle that must be complied with in the
application of Article 10.1 of the OIC Agreement demands that in such situations
the host state employs the existing mechanisms for international mutual legal
assistance. In fact, Article 14(3){a) ICCPR which must be taken into account in
the interpretation of the OIC Agreement — recognizes that trials in absentia pose
special problems in regard to the duty to inform, which must be addressed by the
prosecuting state. According fo the Human Rights Committee, special

precautions are required in this respect: “the effective exercise of the rights under
article 14 presupposes that the necessary steps should be taken to inform the
accused beforehand about the proceedings against him” under article 14(3)(a).
There are “certain limits to the efforts which can duly be expected of the
responsible authorities of establishing contact with the accused" but it is clear
that Indonesia did not come close to reaching those limits in the way it treated

the Claimant.

. The Claimant submits that the Respondent failed to take the required special

precautions needed to inform the Claimant of the fact that he was being
investigated”. The Respondent cannot justify this failure on the basis that it
would have been required to undertake excessive measures, since the
Respondent relied upon that convention to seek the freezing of the Claimant’s
assets in Hong Kongis3 and that convention also applies in its relations with
Saudi Arabia. The UNTOC contains a prescribed mechanism for the delivery of
judicial documents and was thus available to ensure that the Claimant was duly
informed of the fact that he was being investigated, Under Article 18 UNTOC
(and 46(3)(b) UNCAC), Saudi Arabia undertook to afford other convention
parties - including the Respondent - the widest possible mutual assistance in
investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to the offences
covered by the Convention®’, However, despite the availability of a mechanism
that would have enabled the Respondent properly and in a timely manner to
inform the Claimant of the investigation, the Respondent opted not to undertake
the effort to honour the Claimant’s basic right in this regard.

(b) Failure to hear the Claimant
The Claimant claims that in addition to failing to inform him about the

investigation, the Respondent conducted and concluded the whole investigation

without ever hearing or taking a statement from him",

The Claimant further submits that according to UNTOC Article 18(3)(a) and
UNCAC Article 46(3)(a), mutual assistance to be afforded under the convention
may be requested for the purpose of “ftJaking of evidence or statements from
persons.” In other words, under the UNTOC it was possible for the Respondent
to request that the authorities of Saudi Arabia interrogate the Claimant or even
allow investigators of the Respondent to go to Riyadh to hear him and take a
statement from him. Nevertheless, despite this possibility the Respondent opted
not to invoke the relevant provisions in the UNTOC or the UNCAC. Clearly,
there was no excuse for the authorities of the Respondent to prejudice the rights

of the Claimant in such an unfair way.

{e) Failure to dispel doubts about the integrity of the investigations

The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s failure to dispel doubts about the
integrity of the investigations lends further support to the view that the
Claimant’s basic rights were of less concern to the Respondent than the pursuit
of its stated aim to recover state losses. The Claimant also submits that the fact
that the Respondent's inaction with regard to the complaints of corruption made
by the Claimant against those involved in two separate ostensive corruption
attempts renders the Respondent’s conduct a violation of the Claimant’s basic
rights. The criminal prosecution of the Claimant cannot be considered compliant
with the Claimant's basic rights so long as the improprieties in the investigation
and his subsequent prosecution remain unaddressed. The Claimant claims that

letters outlining the bribery attempts were sent to;

1) _ the Attorney General,

2) the Central Jakarta District Court

3) the panel of judges hearing the case; and

4) _ the Special Task Force on Judicial Corruption

With the exception of a short letter of acknowledgement from the Task Force,

these letters remain without any response to date. The Claimant argues that

76

without these unanswered letters and complaints, this Tribunal would have been

tight to dismiss the argument of corruption.

211. The Claimant submits that in the present case, the Claimant sought redress in the
way just described, but to no avail, He had to wait until the Final Hearing in
March 2014 to hear any explanation that could have alleviated his concerns

regarding the integrity of the investigations against him.

212, The Claimant also argues that the nature of the Respondent’s breach in this
regard is all the more egregious, because the UNCAC restricts the signatories”

discretion in matters of investigation and prosecution of corruption allegations:

“Each State Party shall endeavour to ensure that any discretionary legal powers under
its domestic law relating to the prosecution of persons for offences established in
accordance with this Convention are exercised to maximize the effectiveness of law
enforcement measures in respect of those offences and with due regard to the need to

deter the commission of such offences”.

{iv) The Respondent deprived the Claimant of his basic rights, when it failed properly
to summon him to attend the criminal trial

(a) Selective use of the available mechanisms for mutual legal

assistance

213. The Claimant submits that he never received any of the summonses at the
material time. He denies having done so and the Respondent has never produced
acopy of any receipt or acknowledgement from him. Given that, as stated in the
Interlocutory Judgment of the Central Jakarta District Court, the Respondent’s
objective was to confiscate the Claimant’s and Mr, Rizvi’s assets and it was less
concerned with their imprisonment, the Respondent avoided using the prescribed
procedures under the governing international treaties that would have ensured

delivery of the summonses to the Claimant.

°? The United Kingdom signed the UNCAC on 9 December 2003 and ratified fhe same on 9 February 2006.
For Saudi Arabia these dates are 9 January 2004 and 29 April 2013 respectively. Saudi Arabia signed the
UNTOC
14 December 2000 and ratified on 9 February 2006, On the status of these convention in Hong Kong, see:

. According to the Jakarta District Criminal Court, international criminal law is

one of the governing sources of law in the criminal proceedings against the
Claimant: Taking into account, whereas as both the Defendant are under foreign
citizen status and both the Defendants are also currently believed to be abroad,
and their assets located in foreign countries as well, then the offenses charged by
the Public Prosecutor has been passed jurisdiction boundaries of Indonesia, then
in this case the panel of judges instead of considering provisions of national
criminal law will also consider the provision of international criminal law on
Corruption Crime and Money Laundering which has been ratified by the

Government of Indonesia®.

The Jakarta District Criminal Court identified the relevant treaty as being the
UNCAC: “Taking into account, whereas Indonesia is one state that joined the
UN Convention of 2003 on UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION AGAINST
CORRUPTION (UNCAC) is the consequence that national laws and rights owed
by Indonesia as a state party to the UN-protected so that wherever and wherever
corruplor run away and hide its assets it can be tracked and their property

confiscated’”.”

Moreover, in its request for mutual assistance to Hong Kong, Indonesia relied
on the UNTOC. In the second paragraph of the cover letter dated 29 October
2010 accompanying its Second Mutual Legal Assistance Request”, the
Respondent states that the request is, infer alia, “based on United Nations

Convention against Transnational Organized Crimes.”

Thus, according to the Indonesian judiciary and the executive branch, the
UNCAC and the UNTOC are engaged in respect of the criminal proceedings
against the Claimant. The UNCAC and the UNTOC apply to Hong Kong by

reason of P.R. China’s ratification”. It appears, however, that the Indonesian

authorities chose to observe these conventions only when that was convenient to
pursue the assets of the Claimant, but not when that would have ensured the

respect of the Claimant’s fundamental rights.

(b) The Respondent failed to follow the UNCAC and UNTOC

procedures that it invoked to prosecute the Claimant

8. The Claimant submits that The Jakarta District Criminal Court would not have
approved of the summonses had it properly considered Articles 18.1 UNTOC
and 46(3)(b) UNCAC. Under these provisions, the countries relevant to the

proceedings against the Claimant (Hong Kong, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia,

Switzerland, Mauritius and the UK) undertook io afford each other the widest’

possible mutual assistance in investigations, prosecutions and judicial
proceedings in relation to the offences covered by the convention. Article 18,
Section 3 (b) UNTOC and its equivalent in the UNCAC specity that one of the
purposes for which mutual assistance may be requested is “effecting service of

judicial documents,”

ea)

Article 18.7 UNTOC also states that unless another treaty prevails, the
procedures and conditions for mutual assistance set forth in that article are
mandatory. Therefore, the treaties cited by the Jakarta District Criminal Court
establish a mandatory default regime that applies to the service of judicial
documents, which the Court should have considered before approving a trial in

absentia,

220. The Claimant also submits that by acceding to the UNTOC and the UNCAC,

 

and by invoking them in its request for extradition or prosecution of the
Claimant, the Respondent accepted that, in order for a summons to trial to be
legally valid, that summons would have to be processed according to the

procedures prescribed in them,

79

221. Furthermore, the UNTOC and the UNCAC establish a special mechanism for
channeling requests for the service of judicial documents in order to ensure
authenticity, accuracy, and efficiency of service. These mechanisms require each
treaty party to designate a central authority that shall have the responsibility and
power to receive requests for mutual assistance; either to execute them or to
transmit them to the competent authorities for execution. They specifically
stipulate that “fc/entral authorities shall ensure the speedy and proper execution

of or transmission of the requests received”.

222. The Respondent invoked the UNTOC and the UNCAC (i) to seek extradition of
the Claimant from Saudi Arabia, or alternatively to allow for Saudi Arabia to
prosecute the Claimant; (ii) to request mutual assistance from Hong Kong; and
(iii) to prosecute the Claimant. However, those same conventions provide a
mandatory mechanism to ensure that proper notice of proceedings is given,
which mechanism has not been observed by the Respondent. Despite the
availability of a mandatory procedure that would have ensured proper service of

process, this avenue was completely ignored by the Respondent.

223, The Respondent’s invocation of these conventions against the Claimant, and its
subsequent failure to abide by the obligations contained therein, amount to a
violation of the Claimant’s basic rights under domestic law (Law No. 12 of
2005), under ICCPR Article 14(3)(a) and under Article 10(1) of the OIC

Agreement.

224. Furthermore, the Respondent’s invocation of the UNTOC and the UNCAC - in
otder to seek the Claimant’s extradition, to seize the Claimant’s assets, and to
prosecute him — combined with its subsequent failure to adhere to mandatory
procedures in those same treaties in respect of service of the Court summonses -
violates general principles of international law. The Respondent should not be
permitted to resile from its obligations under the UNTOC and the UNCAC,
having invoked them to its own benefit. The Respondent’s conduct violates

general principles of law recognized by civilized nations', or the general

(c) The Respondent's failure to use customary practices also violates

international law

225. The Claimant submits that customary international practice dictates that service
of the court summonses on the Claimant should have been processed in
compliance with the provisions and practices of international law relating to

letters rogatory.

226. A letter rogatory, or letter of request, is a formal request froin a court to a foreign
court for some type of judicial assistance. The most common reinedies sought
by letters rogatory are service of process and the taking of evidence. In many
instances, letters rogatory cannot be transinitted directly between the applicable
courts and must be transmitted via consular or diplomatic channels. International

doctrine on letters rogatory has been codified in international conventions.

227, ‘The Claimant submits that in the present case, there is no evidence that the
investigation summonses or the summonses for the Claimant to attend trial were
processed in compliance with customary international law. The facts show that
the summonses were sent to several addresses (including the Claimant’s office

228. The Claimant submits that the manner in which the Respondent dealt with
service of the summonses cannot be reconciled in any way with ICCPR 14(3)(a)

and therefore violates the Claimant’s “basic rights” under OIC Article 10.1.

229. The Claimant submits that he AGO was not concemed with the question of
whether the Claimant had, in fact, received any of the summonses. When this is
considered in conjunction with the fact that a Red Notice, as opposed to a Blue
Notice, was requested by the Respondent and obtained from INTERPOL, it
becomes abundantly clear that the Respondent failed to use the available
mechanisms to ensure that it would have the Claimant’s residential address for

the purpose of service of the summonses.

230. According to Article 88 (1) of INTERPOL’s Rules for the Processing of Data
“Blue notices are published in order to: (a) obtain information on a person of
interest in a criminal investigation, and/or (b) locate a person of interest in a
criminal investigation, and/or (c) identify a person of interest in a criminal
investigation." Thus if the Respondent really wanted to ascertain the Claimant’s
residential address, rather than engaging in pro forma operations, it should have
asked INTERPOL to issue a Blue Notice in order to locate the Claimant and
establish with accuracy his residential address, in order that he be properly and

effectively served.

The Respondent’s trial in absentia of the Claimant violated its own domestic law,
and deprived the Claimant of his basic rights, inter alia, his right “to be tried in his
presence and to defend himself in person or his counsel of his own choosing” and
to his “conviction and sentence to be reviewed by a higher tribunal according to
law”

(a) Lack of jurisdiction to try the Claimant in absentia

231. The Claimant submits that an aut dedere aut judicare clause excludes the
competence of a treaty party to try an alleged offender in absentia for the offence
covered by the relevant treaty. Indeed, it is only where the accused is present in
a state that the obligation to exercise universal jurisdiction is invoked, because
only then does the state have the requisite “capacity” to take preventative action.

82

232.

233.

 

‘The requirement for the presence of the accused is sensible for practical, as well
as legal, reasons. Without such a condition there would be no point in having an
obligation either to extradite or to prosecute in a multilateral convention; a
simple extradition provision would suffice to enforce those convicted in
absentia. But if the requested state is required either to extradite or to prosecute,
then the requesting state’s jurisdiction will depend on a positive response to an
extradition request. Absent that, the only thing it can demand is that the requested
state abides by the obligation to prosecute. Stated differently, trials in absentia
and the obligation either to extradite or to prosecute are mutually exclusive.
Accordingly, the Respondent lacked the jurisdiction to try the Claimant in

absentia.

This conclusion is reinforced by the Respondent’s own conduct in this matter,
which may be even be considered as having estopped any recourse to a trial in
absentia!®, According to the Claimant the Respondent’s extradition request to
Saudi Arabia dated 29 October 2009! makes interesting reading on this subject.
Paragraph 3 of the extradition request states:

“Should the Government of Saudi Arabia is unable to grant the request for
extradition, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia seeks the
assistance of the Government of Saudi Arabia to carry out investigations
and prosecute Hesham Talaat Besheer Al Warrag under Article 16(10)
UNTOC”.

The Claimant also submits that UNTOC Article 16, Section 10, on which the
Respondent relied in order to seek the Claimant’s extradition, stipulates as

follows:

“A State Party in whose territory an alleged offender is found, if it does
not extradite such person in respect of an offence to which this article
applies solely on the ground that he or she is one of its nationals, shall, at
the request of the State Party seeking extradition, be obliged to submit the

102 CLA283

5 C177

83

234,

235,

236.

case without undue delay to its competent authorities for the purpose of
prosecution. Those authorities shall take their decision and conduct their
proceedings in the same manner as in the case of any other offence of a
grave nature under the domestic law of that State Party. The State Parties

concerned shall cooperate with each other, in particular on procedural

and evidentiary aspects, to ensure the efficiency of such prosecution”.

Given the obligation of the requested party to prosecute whenever it declines to
extradite, it would seem obvious that as a consequence, the UNTOC and
UNCAC do not give the contracting parties the option to try a person in absentia.
Thus any prosecution and trial in absentia in respect of offences covered by the
UNCAC and/or the UNTOC would be at odds with these treaties. The UNCAC
contains a similar provision. According to the Jakarta District Criminal Court’s
own words, the provisions of international criminal law ~ including the UNCAC
— must be taken into account as a matter of Indonesian law. It is clear therefore
that the Jakarta Criminal Court ignored Articles 16(10) UNCAC and 44(11)
UNCAC, contrary to its international law obligations.

Moreover, the Claimant submits that the maxim aut dedere aut judicare
represents the principle that a state must either surrender a suspected criminal
within its jurisdiction to a state that wishes to prosecute the criminal or prosecute

the alleged offender in its own courts,

Other than the exchange between counsel for the Respondent and the Tribunal
reflected above, it is not clear what happened with the Indonesian request to
Saudi Arabia in respect of the Claimant. But the fact is that the Claimant has
never been prosecuted in Saudi Arabia. It can thus be inferred from the fact that
the Claimant was neither extradited nor prosecuted, that Saudi Arabia was not
convinced that a crime had been committed or that the motives for the
prosecution were proper. This is because the obligation to prosecute does not
necessarily imply that proceedings will be undertaken, and still less that the
alleged offender will be punished. Thus, if there is insufficient evidence, the state

where the alleged offender is found, in this case Saudi Arabia, is not obliged to

84

237.

238.

prosecute the alleged offender; nor, of course, does the obligation to prosecute
entail an obligation to punish in the absence of a conviction. The UNCAC and
the UNTOC provide no specific time-frame for the performance of the obligation

to prosecute,

However, the fact that apparently Saudi Arabia decided not to prosecute, or has
ignored its obligation either to prosecute or to extradite the Claimant, does not
mean that the Respondent had therefore the right to try him in absentia by way
of self-help. Thus if the Respondent was of the view that Saudi Arabia failed in
this respect, it was right to take action. However, resorting to trying the Claimant
in absentia was not the indicated course under the UNTOC and the UNCAC. By
providing a dispute settlement mechanism, the UNTOC and the UNCAC
exclude such self-help. Thus, rather than trying the Claimant in absentia the
Respondent should have followed the example of Belgium and sought

enforcement of the UNTOC.

Another course was available to the Respondent. If it disagreed with a Saudi
decision not to cooperate as regards extradition or prosecution (if any), it should
have invoked the dispute settlement clause in the UNTOC to challenge the
decision. That would have been the lawful, just and honorable, way to proceed,
rather than resorting immediately to the extreme measure of trial in absentia.
Both the Respondent and Saudi Arabia have ratified the UNTOC without
making any reservation in respect of Article 16 of UNTOC. Thus this procedure
was available to the Respondent. Only through this procedure could it have been
established whether or not Sandi Arabia was justified in failing to extradite or
prosecute the Claimant. By resorting to the extreme measure of a trial in absentia
instead of invoking Article 16 UNTOC, the Claimant violated the principle of

electa una via, non datur recursus ad alteram,

(b) Disregard of the Minimum Standards

85

239. The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s disregard of the Claimant’s basic
right to a fair trial did not stop there. It continued in the form of a trial and

conviction without the Claimant being present or represented.
{i) Minimum conditions for trials in absentia

240. On 23 February 2006, Indonesia acceded to the 1966 ICCPR. Article 14, Section
3(b) of this treaty provides that: 2 ,

“3. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone
shall be entitled to the following minimum guarantees, in full equality
«an (b) to be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or

through legal assistance of his own choosing”!

241.

This provision consecrates a general principle of law and natural justice that
pertains to the “basic rights” that Article 10.1 of the OIC Agreement seeks to
guarantee. Various international courts, tribunals and other competent bodies

have interpreted this norm.

242. From this jurisprudence it can be concluded that for the extreme measure of trial
in absentia to be permissible under international law, the Respondent must

provide evidence that the Claimant:

1) was notified of the trial, i.e. proper service of process;

2) had unequivocally and explicitly waived his right to be present at trial;

3) had the legal right to be represented at trial and that he was actually

represented;

4) _ is able subsequently to obtain from a court which has heard him a fresh

determination of the merits of the charge.

(4 CLA2S4
86

243,

244,

245,

From the point of view of international law, in particular the basic rights
protected by Article 10.1 of the OIC Agreement, the Claimant claims since the
Respondent cannot provide evidence to meet these cumulative criteria, the
Claimant’s basic rights have been violated. The trend in international law is to
recognise the importance of a defendant’s right to be physically present and to
participate in his or her trial. More and more, trials in absentia are provided for
only in exceptional circumstances or where there has been an explicit,

unequivocal waiver of one’s right to be present,

ICCPR Article 14(3)(d) states that every person shall be entitled “/t/o be tried
in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of

his own choosing. ”!

‘The United Nation’s Hunan Rights Committee, which is the body charged with
supervising compliance with this treaty, further explained this provision in
General Comment No. 13, which states “/t/he accused or his lawyer must have
the right to act diligently and fearlessly in pursuing all available defenses and
the right to challenge the conduct of the case if they believe it to be unfair. When
exceptionally for justified reasons trials in absentia are held, strict observance

of the rights of the defense is all the more necessary,"

. However, the Committee does not define “justified reasons” for holding trials in

absentia. For an elaboration one must look at the jurisprudence of the human
rights courts, Article 6(3) of the European Convention on Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms specifies that everyone charged with a criminal offence
has the right “to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own

choosing...”

(ii) Indonesian law barred the Claimant from being represented by

counsel

The Claimant claims that Indonesian law allows for the extreme measure of trial
in absentia in corruption cases but by virtue of SEMA 6/1988 persons accused
of corruption that are tried in absentia are not allowed to be represented by
counsel, Indonesian law thus barred the Claimant from appointing counsel to
represent him during his trial in absentia, This is a clear contravention of the
principle of fair trial in the Universal Declaration and its articulation in Article
14.3(b) ICCPR.

(iii) Indonesian Jaw barred the Claimant from the right of appeal

. The Claimant submits under Indonesian law the Claimant was not allowed to

appeal his conviction unless he appeared in person. This condition is an
impermissible restriction of his basic rights. Article 14, Section 5 of the ICCPR,
prescribes that “/e/veryone convicted of a crime shall have the right to his
conviction and sentence being reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law”.
Thus SEMA 6/1988 also makes the right to appeal subject to the convicted

person being present in Indonesia.

In other words, according to the evidence tendered by the Respondent, the right
to appeal one’s conviction in absentia is conditioned on the appellant appearing,
in person before the court in order to appeal. Appeal through counsel by convicts
in absentia is thus not permitted. Such condition is in contravention of Article
14, Section 5 of the ICCPR and therefore amounts to a breach of the Claimant’s
basic rights under Article 10.1 of the OIC Agreement.

(iv) The Respondent made it impossible for the Claimant to appeal
The Claimant also submits that ii is also in evidence that, even if the Claimant

had felt able to appear in person in order he could not have because the

Respondent made it practically impossible for him to appeal.

88

251,

253.

254,

The Claimant submits that, according to Indonesian law, the period within which
the Claimant would have had the right to appeal (but for SEMA 6, 1988) was
allowed to expire without ensuring that he was aware of the existence of the
judgment containing his conviction. For the right of appeal to be effectively
available, a convicted person is entitled to have, within a reasonable time, access
to duly reasoned written judgments; failing the availability of such judgments,
Article 14(5) of the [CCPR has been violated.

. The Claimant claims that the Respondent’s authorities allowed the appeals

period to expire without ascertaining whether the Claimant had actually received
the judgment. This failure is attributable to the Respondent because customary
international law contains a long established procedure that would have enabled
the Respondent to establish without any doubt whether and when the Claimant
had received the judgment in order to start the period within which appeals were
allowed. That procedure is codified in Article 5(f) of the Vienna Convention on
Consular Relations (1963) (the “VCCR”), which states that one of the functions
of consular missions is to cooperate with the local authorities when the delivery
judicial documents is necessary. Both Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are parties to
the VCCR. If this procedure had been followed, the authorities of Saudi Arabia
would have informed Indonesia if and when the judgment had actually been
served. For reasons that have yet to be disclosed by the Respondent, it does not
appear that the Respondent followed this procedure and it thus allowed the
appeals period to expire without ascertaining whether the Claimant was actually

aware of the judgment containing his conviction.
(v) The Claimant is excluded from the right fo file for judicial review

The Claimant submits that Indonesian law bars the Claimant from even this very
limited remedy. This is because the amended SEMA 1/2012 excludes absent
convicts from the right to file a petition for judicial review. To file for judicial

review, an absent convict must go to Indonesia.

The Claimant also submits that, even if the Claimant were not excluded from

this right, that would still not erase the violation of his right to appeal. Article

89

255.

256.

257,

258.

14(S) ICCPR provides that “everyone convicted af a crime shall have the right
to his conviction and sentence being reviewed by a higher tribunal according to
law”. The United Nations’ Human Rights Committee has ruled that the existence
of a right to appeal is a right guaranteed by the ICCPR itself and its existence is

thus not in theory dependent on domestic law.
(c) Invalidity of the proceedings

The Claimant submitted that the evidence obtained through the testimony of the
Respondent’s witnesses throughout the proceedings reveals that the Claimant
was never served with the Court summonses and that the Respondent not only
failed to observe the procedures prescribed by the governing multilateral treaties,
but simply abstained from ascertaining whether the Claimant ever received the

summonses.

(d) The Claimant is also entitled to compensation under Article
13.1(d) of the OIC Agreement because the summonses were not in
compliance with Article 227(3) of the Indonesian Code of
Criminal Procedure (“KUHAP”)

The Claimant claims that be is entitled to damages in respect of the Respondent’s
violation of its own domestic laws. The Claimant submits that as a matter of
Indonesian law, service of the summonses to attend trial was not valid. The
ISUHAP specifies the mandatory requirements for summonses and includes a
mandatory provision applicable where the defendant is overseas.

Article 145(1) of the KUHAP requires that a Court summons to attend trial must
be “conveyed by written summons at a defendant’s residence or most recent
place of residence”. Furthermore, Article 227(1) of the KUHAP requires that
the summons be conveyed no later than three days before the hearing. Article
227(2) of the KUHAP requires that the “official that executes the summons must

personally meet and directly speak with the person summoned”,

The Claimant submits that these provisions only apply to domestic summonses.
If the person is not at his or her residential address and is overseas, Article 227(3)

90

259,

ofthe KUHAP applies. Under Article 227(3) of the KUHAP, the summons must
be conveyed “through a legation of the Republic af Indonesia”. The Claimant
claims that he was never summoned at his place of residence through a
representative of the Republic of Indonesia, Furthermore, the Claimant’s
learning about the Hearing through media reports or other channels is not

sufficient under the KUHAP to eliminate the need for good service.

In this regard, the Claimant submits that service purportedly made through PT
Bank Mutiara Tbk is ineffective. Service of process through newspapers does

not meet the express provisions for a proper summons under the KUHAP.

B. The Respondent

260.

‘The Respondent submits that the Claimant was duly served with summonses;
knew full well about the investigation and, later, his trial; knew all the facts of
the case much better than the prosecutors; and nevertheless freely chose not to

attend, even for the investigation stage.

@ The Claimant was preperly made a subject of the Interpol Red Notice

261,

262.

The Respondent submits that the Claimant was summoned to assist in the
investigation, but refused to come, and that he knew very well what had been
going on but would not disclose, thereby withholding information and evidence,
Thus an arrest warrant was issued for the Claimant in December 2008. The
Respondent claims that the Indonesian authorities sent three summonses, each
delivered to his last known addresses and in every other required manner to
ensure these would reach him. They therefore did what any reasonable

government does under the circumstances: they asked Interpol to help find him.

The Respondent submits that Interpol issued “Red Notices” for Mr. Al Warrag
and Mr. Rizvi on June 9, 2009, A Red Notice represents a request for cooperation
from one country’s law enforcement authorities to those of other countries.

According to Interpol’s own web site:

91

“In the case of Red Notices, the persons concerned are wanted by national
jurisdictions for prosecution or to serve a sentence based on an arrest
warrant or court decision. INTERPOL 's role is to assist the national police
forces in identifying and locating these persons with a view to their arrest

and unac or similar lawful action”.

263. The Claimant alleges that he and Mr. Rizvi retained au Indonesian law Professor,

264,

265,

an

Professor Indriyanto Seno Adji, to contact a high ranking police officer they
somehow thought were leading the investigation against them. According to the
Clainant, Professor Indriyanto met this officer in May 2009. The police officer
allegedly asked Professor Indriyanto for US$ 300,000 to discontinue
proceedings against the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi. According to the Respondent,
the Claimant did not provide a witness statement, either in these proceedings or
Mr. Rizvi’s ICSID arbitration brought by Mr. Rizvi, from Professor Indriyanto,
and refused to present him as a witness. The assertion that Indonesian police
sought a bribe to discontinue proceedings against him remains an
unsubstantiated second-hand hearsay allegation. If the Professor’s visit was to
request discontinuance of the case against them, they had to realize that no such

thing was possible.

However, the fact is that the police were not even handling the investigation, let
alone the prosecution of the case against the Claimant. This case was handled by
the Attorney General's office. Any approach to the police could only be
explained as a misplaced attempt by the Claimant and/or his colleagues to buy
their way out, But the offer was made in the wrong venue, and thus could not
have had any connection with the case. The alleged solicitation of a bribe by the
investigator in charge of the case is yet another lie repeated so many times in

hopes the Tribunal will believe it despite not a shred of evidence.

The Respondent submits that assuming for the sake of argument, however, that
there had been credible evidence of a bribe solicitation, then this would not affect
the Red Notice. A Red Notice request is standard international procedure

whenever a person whose arrest has been sought cannot be found within the

92

266.

jurisdiction. There is no real debate that Indonesian authorities had probable

cause to issue an arrest warrant for Mr. Al Warraq and Mr. Rizvi.

There is likewise no debate that the Claimant was in Saudi Arabia, not Indonesia,
when the authorities sought to question, and later to arrest him. The authorities
had two options: forget about him and Mr. Rizvi, or request a Red Notice from
Interpol, The Respondent argues that those steps towards requesting the Red
Notices are conceptually distinct from any supposed bribe solicitation to have
investigation proceedings discontinued, or even to have the Red Notices
withdrawn. Even assuming that the latter allegations are true, they do nothing to

invalidate the former.

Gi) The Claimant was properly served with investigation summonses, and was fully
aware of the proceedings at all relevant times,

267.

268.

269,

The Respondent submits that following the issuance of the Red Notice, the
Claimant was sent three investigation summonses, in December 2009 and
January 2010'°7. The Summonses were sent to the Claimant’s known address in
Saudi Arabia, the hotel in which he always stayed in Jakarta and to his office at
Bank Century (by then Bank Mutiara); were posted on the court notice board,

and published in major Indonesian and English language newspapers.

The Respondent claims that the Claimant acknowledged receiving three
summonses!®, and that even Mr. Rizvi received at least one because he refers to

it in a letter to the Indonesian Attorney General dated 7 January 2010!

The Respondent argues that the Red Notices would not have prevented the
Claimant or Mr, Rizvi from complying with the investigation summonses, to
attend the very proceedings for which failure to come to Indonesia, the Red

Notices were issued in the first place.

93

(ii)

The Claimant was properly served with the court summons

270.

272.

The Respondent submits that when the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi declined to attend
the investigation hearing to which they had been summoned three times, the
Indonesian Attorney General had no option but to proceed to build his case
against them without their input as to any mitigating facts or circumstances. The
Attorney General had no idea what position they would take, what they would
deny, what necded to be proven, so the Prosecutor had to prove everything.
According to the Respondent, that is a perfectly normal and understandable
development: a government’s prosecutors cannot simply wait for absent suspects
to show np and cooperate. If prosecutors believe they have a case to make on the
strength of the witness and documentary evidence before them, and the suspect
has had the opportunity to be tried in his presence and defend himself, but has

refused, then they are entitled to do so.

. The Respondent submits that the Indonesian authorities served three successive

trial summonses on the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi. The first summons was dated
12 March 2010, Because, aside from being served in every prescribed manner in
Indonesia the summons was served overseas, Indonesian authorities sought the
assistance of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry
forwarded the summons information to the Indonesian Embassy in Riyadh; the
Embassy sent the information to the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They
also sought help from Interpol. The Indonesian Prosecutor’s Office forwarded
the court summons to the National Central Bureau ("NCB") in Indonesia. The
NCB in tum sent the summons to its counterpart office in Riyadh. The
Prosecutors also placed the summons on the notice board in Jakarta District

Court, as was the usual practice pursuant to Section 145(5) of the KUHAP.

The Respondent also submits that finally, as an added measure, the Prosecutor
advertised the existence of the summons in both Media Indonesia (a widely-read
Indonesian language daily newspaper) and the Jakarta Post, Indonesia’s leading

English language newspaper, which is also widely read by Indonesian-interested

94

persons outside of Indonesia through that newspaper's website, on which the
entire publication is posted on a daily basis!'®. The District Court held a hearing,
on 18 March 2010. The Prosecutors explained that they served the summonses
several ways, but that the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi had not responded. The Court
adjourned the hearing until 19 April 2010.

273. On 24 March 2010, the Prosecutors issued a second set of summonses to the
Claimant and Mr, Rizvi. Once again, the summonses were sent both to the NCB,
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, posted on the court's notice board and
advertised in newspapers. The Prosecutors also sent copies of the summionses to
the President of Bank Mutiara (Bank Century’s successor), and to the Hotel
Shangri-La, the place where both the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi were known to

have stayed on their previous visits to Indonesia.

274. Moreover, Bank Mutiara forwarded the Claimant’s summons to his known
address in Saudi Arabia. Likewise, the Indonesian Embassy in Riyadh confirmed
that counterparts in the Saudi Foreign Ministry had delivered the summons to
the Claimant’s address, That address was the same as the one that the Claimant
lists as his residence in his Statements for the present Arbitration. The Claimant
does not deny that he received this summons and, in fact, as referred to above,

confirmed, when testifying, that he had.

275. The Respondent submits that neither the Claimant nor Mr. Rizvi appeared at the
adjourned hearing on 19 April 2010. The judges accordingly ordered that the
Prosecutors serve the summonses a third time, and adjourned the hearing until
19 May 2010, The Prosecutors served a third set of summonses on the Claimant

and Mr. Rizvi, using the same channels as refereed above.

276. The court resumed session on 19 May 2010, but again the Claimant and Mr.
Rizvi failed to appear. The Court adjourned yet again to determine whether it

was now appropriate to proceed in absentia. On 2 June 2010, the Court

NC Wwayw,thejakartapost.com
95

concluded that the manner and methods of service had been sufficient and

reasonably calculated to apprise the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi of the hearing.

277. The Court adjourned the hearing until 10 Tune 2010. On that date, the trial of the
Claimant and Mr. Rizvi was to begin, with or without them. They had been duly
served and there is no doubt that the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi knew very well
both that they had been summoned and. that their trial was about to proceed in
absentia. The Court’s decision reflected its conclusion that the Indonesian
authorities had tried repeatedly and in good faith to serve the Claimant and Mr.
Rizvi with notice of the impending hearing. That of course is the purpose of a

summons.

278. The Respondent submits that the Claimant nor Mr. Rizvi claims to have been
ignorant of the proceedings against them in Indonesia. They merely chose not to
attend, Meanwhile they had been trying to create evidence of corruption in the
investigation process, to use as an excuse. The Respondent submits as a matter

of Indonesian law, the summonses were validly and properly served.

279, The Respondent as a matter of both fact and law, therefore, the summonses were
valid and proper, As a matter of fact, there is no doubt that the Claimant had
received at least three summonses and knew of the proceedings against him. As
a matter of law, the summonses were valid when sent through the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, as well as being validly served through other means. As a matter

of fact, notice was effectively received. The summonses served their essential

purpose.

(iv) By refusing to comply with the court summons, the Claimant was properly tried in
absentia

280. The Respondent submits that the ICCPR requires that he be entitled to be present
and to defend himself in person or through counsel. As long as he is present, he
may choose whether to defend himself in person or by counsel, but may not do
both, That is what is meant by "or". But he cannot choose not to be present and
still have the right to be defended by counsel. That is what is meant by "and".
He must be present to be entitled to the benefit that follows.

96

281.

282.

LRG]

According to the Respondent, the Claimant was not compelled to be absent. He
was not told that he could not attend under any circumstances. He was not
convicted in secret, without any opportunity to present a defense, He was given
more than adequate notice and had more than ample opportunity to attend and

defend himself. He intentionally chose not to do so.

The Respondent argues that there is thus nothing in international law that
provides a blanket prohibition against ia absentia trials. The purpose of the
ICCPR’s fair trial provisions in Article 14 is to ensure that a defendant has
baseline guarantees against procedurally or substantively unfair judicial
proceedings. They do not -- nor are they intended to -- provide a defendant with
complete immunity from prosecution if he chooses not to answer for the crimes
alleged against him, According to the Respondent, if that were the case, every
defendant would do what the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi did.

Moreover, the Respondent submits that even the court of Hong Kong, has found
that the Indonesian summonses were served properly on the Claimant and that it
would not be contrary to the interests of justice to recognise and enforce the
Indonesian judgment. In fact at paragraph 97 of that Judgment the court of Hong
Kong found that “Mr. Rizvi and [Mr. Al Warraq] had suffered no unfairness,
prejudice or injustice in the proceedings in Indonesia”""". As is evident from that
judgment, the court of Hong Kong analysed the facts and considered expert
opinions. The Respondent also submits that the requests for mutual legal
assistance to Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia were made in compliance with
Indonesian law'!?, In any case the burden of proof is on the Claimant to prove
that acts attributable to the Respondent were: “...shocking, egregious behaviour
that every reasonable person would recognise that it fell short of international

standards”, According to the Respondent, the Claimant failed to do so.

Furthermore, concerning the denial of justice claim, the Respondent argues that
the Claimant’s attempt to bring a denial of justice claim under Article 10(1) of
the OIC Agreement contorts its language and defies the rules of treaty
interpretation, as set out in Article 31 of the VCLT

Article 10(1) speaks of “basic rights” in the context of the “ownership,
possession or utilisation of his capital”, as is obvious from the construction,
context and objective of the provision. It does not concern the “human rights” of

an OIC national in relation to a criminal proceeding.

The preamble to the OIC Agreement on Investment inakes clear that the treaty
must be read in conjunction with the OIC Charter of 1972: “In keeping with the
objectives of the Organization of the Islamic Conference as stipulated in its

Charter...”
The preamble to the OIC Charter says that members should respect:

“the present Charter, the Charter of the United Nations and international
law...while strictly adhering to the principle of noninterference in matters
which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State”

(Preamble to OIC Charter penultimate paragraph.)

“to strive to achieve good governance...non-interference in matters which
are within their domestic jurisdiction” (Preamble of OIC Charter Iast
paragraph)

Article 2(6) of the OIC Charter further states:
“As mentioned in the UN Charter, nothing contained in the present
Charter shall authorise the Organization and its Organs to intervene in
matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State

or related to it;”

The Respondent submits that the Contracting Parties to the OIC Agreement did
not intend for criminal matters within the domestic jurisdiction of the states to
be submitted to an arbitral tribunal. The Respondent also submits that even

98

@

accepting, for argument’s sake, that Article 10 somehow refers to basic human
rights, it is absolutely clear that the Contracting Parties intended that a “decision
given by a competent judicial authority” would be a permissible measure (Article

10(2)(b)).

290. The Jakarta Court’s decision to convict Mr. Al Warraq in absentia is such a
permissible measure under Article 10 and thus cannot constitute a violation of
the OIC Agreement.

THE CLAIMANTS’ EXPROPRIATION CLAIM

The Claimant

291. The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s pre-bailout actions amount to an
expropriation of the Claimant’s investment in breach of Article 10.1 of the OIC

Agreement, which provides as follows:

“The host state shall undertake not to adopt or permit the adoption of any
measure — itself or through one of its organs, institutions or local
authorities — if such a measure may directly or indirectly affect the
ownership of the investor's capital or investment by depriving him totally
or partially of his ownership or all er part of his basic rights or the
exercise of his authority on the ownership, possession or utilization of his
capital, or of his actual control over the investment, its management,

making use out of it, enjoying its utilities, the realization”.
Bank Indonesia’s negligent supervision
(a) Bank Indonesia owed a duty to stakeholders such as the Claimant
(1) The Claimant’s reasonable expectation
292. The Claimant submits that Indonesia owed such a duty to the Claimant, as a
shareholder in an Indonesian bank. Those investing in banks will always have

the fact of close regulation of banks at the heart of their calculating on whether
99

to invest. Regulation provides a degree of trust, on which investors, whose

investments are sought, are entitled to rely,

293. According to the Claimant, he and Mr. Rizvi confirmed that they had such
expectations of Bank Indonesia. At paragraph 79 of his First Witness Statement,
Mr. Rizvi states that he “also had [his] own expectations of Bank Indonesia and
assumed it would be fulfilling its own obligations as regulator of Bank Century.”
The Claimant confirmed that lie “knew from [his] prior experience that banking
was a regulated activity in Indonesia, and that Bank Indonesia played an active
and central role in the functioning of the banking sector. This was an important
component in our decision to invest: without a reasonable degree of supervision

and regulation, investing in Indonesia would have been much less attractive."

294. The Claimant claims that it was therefore reasonable for him, as shareholder, to

expect Bank Indonesia to carry out its supervisory duties effectively,

(2) Bank Indonesia’s assurances

295. The Claimant claims that his expectations of Bank Indonesia were, in part, based
on representations Bank Indonesia had itself made as to its regulatory regime.
In 1999, Bank Indonesia announced publicly that it intended to enhance its
banking supervision and, in 2006, the Respondent presented a roadmap for the
implementation of the Basel Core Principles on Banking Supervision. These acts

contributed to an impression of the Respondent’s regulatory environment.

296. The Claimant further submits that in those circumstances and bearmg in mind
the extent of Bank Indonesia’s involvement in supervising and overseeing the
Pre-Merger Banks’ preparation for the merger over the course of nearly three
years and its approval of the merger on 15 December 2004, the Claimant was
entitled to, and did, rely on Bank Indonesia’s representations as to its supervisory

capabilities,

300.

(b) Bank Indonesia’s negligent supervision

The Claimant submits that Bank Indonesia has a wide range of powers at its
disposal in order to achieve its aim as regulator and supervisor of banks. It
utilises a risk-based system that requires banks to undergo regular self-
assessment and allows Bank Indonesia to monitor the banking sector before
problems arise. It also has a range of actions available for it to deal with banks
that fail to comply with the relevant regulations and requirements, including
varying levels of supervision, the ability to revoke a bank’s licence and to
prohibit those who are not deemed Fit and Proper from involvement in the
banking sector. However, Bank Indonesia negligently or wilfully failed to avail

itself of those powers.

(©) Bank Indonesia’s failure te properly supervise had an

expropriatory effect

The Claimant claims that the Respondent’s negligent failure to properly
supervise Bank Century and Mr. Tantular’s consequent fraud on the bank
amounts to an unlawful expropriation, which had the effect of destroying the

Claimant’s investment,

Article 10.1 of the OIC Agreement presents expropriation as an exceptional
measure, subject to several conditions. By virtue of the first paragraph of Article
10, the Respondent commits itself “ot to adopt or permit the adoption of any
measure — itself or through one of its organs, institutions or local authorities —
if such a measure may directly or indirectly affect the ownership of the invester’s
capital or investment by depriving him totally or partially of his ownership or of
all or part of his basic rights or the exercise of his authority on the ownership,
possession or utilization of his capital, or of his actual control over the
investment, its management, making use out of it, enjoying its utilities, the

realization of its benefits or guaranteeing its development and growth.”

According to the Claimant, his general undertaking applies to all forms of
“capital” or “investment” as defined in Article 1 of the OIC Agreement.

101

Consequently, it covers the ownership of shares. It is the following paragraph
that contains the exception to this general undertaking. Article 10(2)(a)
essentially provides that it is permissible to “/e/xpropriate the investment in the
public interest in accordance with the law, without discrimination and on prompt
payment of adequate and effective compensation to the investor in accordance
with the laws of the host state regulating such compensation, provided that the
investor shail have the right to contest the measure of expropriation in the

competent court of the host state”.

30

. Hence, any restriction of property rights is subject to limitations — expropriation
of an investment being permitied only if it complies with certain specific
conditions and, first and foremost, with the law of the host state. Furthermore,
the measure must not be discriminatory and compensation must be offered to the

investor for depriving him or her of his or her property rights,

302. The Claimant submits that the general obligation set out in Article 10.1 concerns
both direct and indirect takings of property rights. Article 10 of the OIC
Agreement also contemplates those measures short of physical takings that
amount to expropriation in that they permanently destroy the economic value of
the investment or deprive the owner of its ability to manage, use or control its

property in a meaningful way.

303. The Claimant submits that the issue has been raised here whether Article 10 of
the OIC Agreement has any application in respect of bona fide regulatory
measures such as the rescue of a bank from insolvency. It is a general rule of
customary international law that a bona fide regulatory act that genuinely
pursues a legitimate public policy objective and complies with the requirements
of non-discrimination, due process and proportionality may not be designated as
expropriatory, despite an adverse economic impact! ">, The Claimant clains that,
this is not the case here. The Claimant’s main claim is related to the absence of
regulation or, more precisely, the improper and insufficient exercise of

regulatory power by the Respondent. Bank Century’s worsening liquidity

U5 CLAI39
102

304.

305.

position and subsequent placement under state administration are the result of
Bank Indonesia’s failure to take in due course the necessary regulatory measures
which should have been taken pursuant to domestic law and good international

banking practices and regulations in order to save the bank from collapse.

It is well-established in international law that the violation by a State of one or
more of its international obligations may arise just as easily from passivity as
from positive action, Therefore, States may be held responsible for both their

actions and their omissions insofar as they constitute international wrongful acts.

The Claimant states that it is because the regulatory function was exercised in a
deficient manner that Bank Century was in a critical situation. The fundamental
cause of the Claimant’s problems and of the damage suffered by him is Bank
Indonesia’s weak and negligent supervision of Bank Century. The fate of Bank
Century is not, as the Respondent has repeatedly alleged, the result of the
Claimant’s — and Mr. Rizvi’s — actions, but the logical consequence of Bank
Indonesia’s failure adequately to perform its duties and properly to supervise the
Bank’s operations. The Claimant submits that were it not for Bank Indonesia’s
negligence in failing properly to regulate Bank Century, Mr. Tantular would not
have been able to carry out the extensive fraud to which he has admitted and
both the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi would still enjoy the benefit of their investment.
The injection of capital into Bank Century and its subsequent placement under
state administration represents a face saving measure and an attempt by those in

charge of the bank’s supervision to avoid responsibility.

The LPS takeover of Bank Centary

306.

The Claimant’s second proposition which supports a finding of unlawful
expropriation, is that the unlawful bailout of Bank Century was an expropriation

in itself, for which the Claimant has received no compensation,

(a) Questionable legality of the bailout

103

307. Itis the Claimant’s case that the bailout was unlawful because, inter alia, it was

308.

30

310.

9,

2

authorized pursuant to a government regulation in lieu of law — a Perpu — that

was subsequently rejected by the Indonesian Parliament.

The Claimant submits that Perpu No. 4 of 2008 was introduced by the Indonesian
Government on 15 October 20081", Its stated purpose was “in the effort to face
Jinancial crises threats having the potentials to endanger the stability of national
Jinancial and economy system [...] to stipulate a strong legal basis in the context
of the prevention and handling of crises.” Yn order to achieve this stated
objective, Perpu No. 4 of 2008 provided for the establishment of the KSSK, a
financial system stability committee, whose membership would consist of the
Minister of Finance and the Governor of Bank Indonesia. The KSSK was
empowered “to stipulate policies in the context of the prevention and handling
of crises.” The KSSK’s powers included the ability, where a bank has been
declared by Bank Indonesia as a “default bank” having a “systemic impact” to
determine whether said bank has a systemic impact or not. If the KSSK so
decided, the handling of the failed bank would then be passed over to the LPS,
which body is responsible for managing the failed bank, including by injecting
bailout funds.

The Claimant further submits that the day on which Perpu no. 4 of 2008 was
introduced — 15 October 2008 ~- is the day on which the Claimant, Mr. Rizvi and
Mr. Tantular were required to attend Bank Indonesia’s office in Jakarta to sign
the last Letter of Commitment. The decision to bail out Bank Century was
ultimately taken by the KSSK at a meeting during the night of 20 to 21
November 2008. The Claimant submits that there was first a meeting of Bank
Indonesia officials at which the recommendation was made by Bank Indonesia

to the KSSK that Bank Century was a “failed bank” with a “systemic impact.”
Following the Bank Indonesia meeting, on the same night, the KSSK met and

approved Bank Indonesia’s determination that Bank Century was a failed bank

having a systemic impact and this decision paved the way for the bailout which

104

311.

312.

313.

314.

was ultimately carried out by means of an injection of funds by the LPS. After
the bailout occurred, in its sitting on 18 December 2008, the Indonesian
Parliament did not approve Perpu No, 4 of 2008. The Parliament subsequently
sent a letter to the President on 24 December 2008, asking the government to
submit a Financial System Security Net Bill on 19 January 2009. The
government did this on 14 January 2009. In its closing provisions, that bill sought

to annul the Perpu.

In late September 2009, the Parliament, together with the Finance Minister,
decided the bill could not be deliberated further during the term of the 2004-
2009 Parliament. Tis bill, along with several others, was retumed to the
President. On 11 December 2009, the government introduced a bill to revoke
Perpu No.4 of 2008. According to press reports, this bill was sent back to the

President by Parliament because it contained an error.

Moreover, the recommendation made by Bank Indonesia to the KSSK that Bank

century was a failed bank with a systemic effect was not unanimous.

Taken together, these events cast serious doubt over the true motive for the

bailout and call into question the legal basis for it.

Furthermore, there is evidence that the bailout was not lawful as Bank Century
did not fit the criteria stipulated in government regulation in lieu of Perpu No. 4
of 2008, which mandated that any bank that was to be bailed out had to be shown
to pose a systemic risk to the Indonesian banking sector. The Claimant also
claims that a few weeks before the bailout, Bank Century applied for short term
liquidity; the Directorate of Banking Supervision’s assessment of Banc
Century’s ineligibility for short term funding was overruled by the then Deputy
Governor of Bank Indonesia and current Vice President, Mr. Boediono. The
Claimant submits that the Parliament has neither approved nor rejected Perpu
No. 4 of 2008, in spite of the constitutional requirement that any Perpu must
obtain the approval of the Parliament at its next sitting, Consequently, there
remains serious doubt as to the current status of Perpu No. 4 of 2008 and the
effect this has on the legality of the bailout. In addition, the Claimant claims that

105

 

316.

317.

the decision to bail out Bank Century, which decision remains the focus of
significant and serious scrutiny and criticism in Indonesia today, was not sound
and was taken in order to protect a limited number of very high profile
politically-linked depositors who stood to lose significant amounts of money if

Bank Century was allowed to fail.

. The Claimant submits that whatever the true reason for the bailout, it is clear that

it amounts to an unlawful expropriation, for which the Claimant has received no

compensation.

(b) Failure to follow the proper procedures

The Claimant refers to Articles 21 and 22 of the Indonesian Deposit Insurance
Committee Regulation No. 5/PLPS/2006, as amended by IDIC Regulation No.
3/PLPS/2008 which provide as follows:

Article 21

Ail expenses for rescuing a systemic failing bank spent by IDIC constitute

a temporary capital participation in such bank.

Article 22

(1) In the event of temporary capital participation as mentioned in Article
21, the bank issues convertible preferred stock which is convertible into

ordinary shares.

(2) Convertible preferred stock which is convertible into ordinary shares
as refer to in (1) is shares which grant preferred rights in: obtaining non-
cumulative dividend; and obtaining first payment in the event bank is
liquidated.

The Claimant submits that as such, the LPS’s capital injection into Bank Century
is reflected in the issue of ordinary shares in the bank to the LPS. These shares

106

provide the LPS with preferential rights over otler shareholders, such as the
Claimant, in obtaining dividend payments and payment in the event Bank

Mutiara is liquidated,

318. In this regard, the Claimant submits that there are no evidence to support the
Respondent’s assertion that the Claimant consented to the bailout and that he
was given an opportunity to inject funds into Bank Century at the time of the
bailout in order to preserve his percentage ownership in the bank. There is
nothing in any of the Letters of Commitment signed by the Claimant which could

constitute prospective consent to the bailout process.

319. Pursuant to Article 22(1)(b) of the IDIC Law:'!?

(1) The resolution or handling of a Failing Bank [...] is performed by IDIC

with the following procedures:

a. The resolution of a Failing Bank that does not have a systemic effect is

done by rescuing or not rescuing the aforementioned Failing Bank;

b. The handling of a Failing Bank that has a systemic effect is done by
rescuing the Failing Bank with or without existing shareholders’

participation.

320. Chapter V (Resolution and Handling of Failing Banks) of the IDIC Law is
divided into five sections, as follows: Section One (Decision making); Section
Two (Rescuing a Failing Bank That does Not Have a Systemic Effect); Section
Three (Not Rescuing Failing Banks That Do Not have a Systemic Effect);
Section Four (Handling of A Systemic Failing Bank With Capital Injection by
the Shareholders); and Section Five (Handling of a Systemic Failing Bank
Without Capital Injection by the Shareholders).

 

"7 CLA277
107

322.

323.

324.

325.

. Section Four (Handling of a Systemic Failing With Capital Injection by the

Shareholders), Article 32 provides that “/t/he handling of a systemic failing bank
shall be performed by the IDIC by involving the shareholders” (emphasis
added). Articles 33 to 38 go on to set out the procedures for the handling of a

failing bank in those circumstances.

Section Five (Handling of a Systemic Failing Bank Without Capital Injection by
the Shareholders), Article 39 provides that “{iJn the instance of the handling of
the Failing Bank as stipulated in Article 32 cannot be carried out, the IDIC shall
undertake the handling of the Failing Bank without shareholders’ participation”
(emphasis added). Articles 40 to 42 inclusive detail the procedures for the
handling of a failed bank in those circumstances.

The Claimant submits that taken together, the mandatory nature of Article 32
(‘shall be performed by the IDIC by involving the shareholders”) and the
qualification in Article 39 (“in the instance of the handling of the Failing Bank
as stipulated in Article 32 cannot be carried out”) make it clear that there is an
obligation on the LPS to involve the shareholders of the failing bank in the

bailout unless there is a reason why that cannot be done.

Accordingly, it was mandatory on the LPS to involve, inter alia, the Claimant
and Mr. Rizvi in the capital injection process, as stipulated in Articles 33 to 38
of the IDIC Law, which affords them the opportunity to participate in the process
by injecting a minimum of 20% capital from the estimated total handling cost.
Only in circumstances where the bailout could not be carried out with their
involvement, as stipulated in Articles 33 to 38, would it have been permissible
for LPS to proceed with the capital injection without the Claimant’s and FGAH’s

involvement.

The Claimant submits that even if the LPS were not required to involve the
shareholders in the bailout process having chosen to do so, it was incumbent on
the Respondent’s LPS to follow the specific procedures set down in Articles 33
to 39 of the IDIC Law. These include obtaining various statements and releases
from the shareholders at a general meeting of shareholders of the bank. No

108

326.

327.

328.

329,

330.

evidence has been provided by the Respondent and the Claimant denies that he
was ever consulted about the bailout process — let alone that he attended a general

meeting of shareholders in order to provide such statements and releases.

In light of the above, the Claimant submits that the bailout was clearly unlawful
as the LPS failed to comply with the relevant procedures mandated by the [DIC

Law.

(c) The LPS bailout is an act of state attributable to the Respondent

Article 10,1 of the OIC Agreement prohibits the “host state” from adopting or
permitting the adoption of any measure “itself or through one of its organs,

institutions or local authorities.”

The Claimant submits that as “organs” or “jnstitutions” of the Respondent, the
KSSK’s decision to bail out Bank Century and the LPS’s injection of funds and
issue of new shares are measures capable of being caught by the prohibition

contained in Article 10.1.

Alternatively, the decision to bailout Bank Century by the KSSK and the
injection of funds and equity participation by the LPS are acts of the state for
which the Respondent is liable as a matter of customary international law and in
accordance with the principles stipulated in the Draft Articles on State
Responsibility (the “ILC Draft Articles”).

Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles provides that the conduct of any person or
entity acting as an organ of the state, including the exercise of legislative,
executive, judicial or any other governmental function, is attributable to the state.
A state “organ” is “to be understood in the most general sense. It extends to
organs from any branch of the State, exercising legislative, executive, judicial

or any other functions,”358

109

331.

332.

333.

334,

335,

336.

The Claimant submits that the LPS is an organ of the Respondent, empowered
under the IDIC Law to handle failing banks having a systemic impact, inter alia,

by way of capital injection and equity participation,

The KSSK, the body ultimately responsible for the decision to declare Bank
Century a “failed bank” having a “systemic effect,” is also an organ of the

Respondent, empowered to do so by virtue of the Perpu.

As such, the conduct of the KSSK and the LPS in deciding (i) to bailout Bank
Century on the basis of its status as a “failed bank” having a “systemic impact”;

and (ii) in effecting the bailout, is attributable the Respondent.

({d) The bailout amounts to an expropriation

The Claimant further submits that the effect of the Respondent’s unlawful
injection of funds has been to reduce the Claimant’s shareholding to such a tiny
percentage of Class B shares that he cannot use his investment in any meaningful
way. In this way, the Respondent’s actions have both “directly and indirectly
affect{ed] the [Claimant's] exercise of his authority on ownership, possession

or utilization of his capital.”

Article 10 of the OIC Agreement covers “any measure” adopted by the host State
which “may directly or indirectly affect the ownership of the investor's capital
or investment...” It follows that if one accepts, for the sake of argument, the
Respondent’s proposition that “no shares were expropriated at all” in the formal
sense, the acts and omissions of the Respondent, through Bank Indonesia,
eventually had an effect “tantamount to expropriation”, according to the

consecrated formula in international mvestment treaties.

In the circumstances, the Respondent’s bailout of Bank Century amounts to an
expropriation of the Claimant’s investment in breach of Article 10.1 of the OIC
Agreement, entitling the Claimant to compensation under Article 13.1(a) of the

OIC Agreement. The bailout caused the Claimant’s shareholding in Bank

110

337.

Century to be reduced from around 9.55% to less than 0.004%, thereby causing

substantial damage to the Claimant.

Furthermore, the Claimant submits that the bailout was not in compliance with
Indonesian law as (i) it was undertaken pursuant to a government regulation that
was later rejected by Parliament; and (ii) the LPS failed to follow the proper
procedures for the involvement of shareholders in accordance with Law No. 24
of 2004. In the circumstances, the bailout was carried out in breach of Indonesian
law and the Claimant is entitled to compensation for the damage caused pursuant
to Article 13.1¢d) of the OIC Agreement.

iii) The competing fraud analyses and their impact on the Claimant’s expropriation

damages claim

338.

339.

Dr. Okongwu’s damages calculation stems from a basic set of assumptions that
differ from those contained in the Brattle Group’s Report. There are two
competing explanations for the liquidity crisis experienced by Bank Century in
2008. The Brattle Group’s explanation is that the liquidity crisis was down to a
fraud by the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi which resulted in Bank Century being
insolvent at the time of the bailout. The second expianation, which the Claimant
advances, is that Bank Century’s liquidity problems were the result of Bank
Indonesia’s poor supervision, as demonstrated by Mr. Tantular’s crimes which
resulted in a very substantial sum of money being taken from the bank. This
substantial hole in Bank Century’s books exceeded the bank’s market
capitalisation and only became apparent after Bank Century’s nationalisation.
That is the Claimant’s case, and the assumption upon which Dr. Okongwu’s
damages calculation is based. :

At the Final Hearing, Dr. Okongwu explained the two important factors bearing
on his damages calculation: the date on which to calculate the value of the
Claimant’s shareholding and the method to employ. He went on to explain that
he chase 10 November 2008 and not 21 November 2008 as the appropriate
valuation date because rumours surrounding Bank Century’s liquidity became
public on 13 November 2008. As the Claimant’s case is that those liquidity

problems resulted from the Respondent’s poor supervision, if the Claimant

i

succeeds in establishing liability, it is appropriate to use as the valuation date the
last trading date before the rumours circulated and any effect on the share price

was felt.

340. Dr. Okongwu then explained the market model calculation based on the
historical relationship between Bank Century’s shares and certain factors that
ought to explain it, such as how similar banks perform and how the stock market
as a whole performs. Dr. Okongwu then explained the adjustment he made to
that figure to account for the USD 40 million MCB that had not yet been
reflected in Bank Century’s books, even though the cash had been received. The
difference between the valuation of the Claimant’s shareholding as at 10
November 2.008 and the value of his shares in Bank Century post-nationalisation
(zero) gives Dr. Okongwu his expropriation damages figure of USD 4.48

million.

341. Although the Brattle Group took issue with a number of details pertaining to the
methodology employed by Dr. Okongwu in his valuation of the Claimant’s pre-
nationalisation shares in Bank Century, these criticisms were easily defeated by
Dr. Okongwu in his oral testimony. The only element of Dr. Okongwu’s analysis
which the Brattle Group challenged with any conviction was his assumption that
Bank Century would have been worth something but for Bank Indonesia’s poor

supervision and the resulting Tantular fraud.

B. The Respondent

(a) The bailout was not an expropriation, but even if it were, it would

be a permissible one.

342. The Respondent submits that:

(@ The Claimant has the same number of shares as he did before the
pailout, if in fact he had any. Nothing was taken; funds were injected.

And there has been no diminution in the value of those shares,

112

 

343. The Respondent submits that expropriation is a governmental taking or

modification of an individual’s property rights, and what happened to the
Claimant’s shares, if he bad any, was not an expropriation, by that or any other
reasonable definition. Indonesian regulators did not take his shares; they did not
seize the bank. The Claimant’s holdings (to be more precise, FGAH’s) remain
exactly as they were before the bailout: some 2.7 billion shares, valued at least

at 50 Rupiah per share, and they may now be worth more than that.

344, The Respondent submits that the Claimant was not in any way deprived of his

alleged shareholding. No shares were taken. All shareholders retained, and as
far as we are aware still retain, the same number of shares. Funds were injected
into the bank and a new class of shares was issued to evidence this interest. The
original, now class B, shares were valued at that time at Rp. 78 per share,

whereas the new, class A, shares were issued at the value of Rp. 0.01 per share.

345. The Respondent argues that even if this could be interpreted as an expropriation,

Article 10(1)(a) of the OIC Agreement makes it plain that an expropriation is
permissible if it is non-discriminatory, lawful under the host state’s law and
compensation is provided in accordance with the host state’s law. The Claimant
cannot prove that Indonesian law was violated nor that he was not given due
compensation under Indonesian law. Nor was there any discrimination, as all
shareholders, be they Indonesian or foreign, nationals or legal entities, were
treated in the same manner. Furthermore, the bailout itself was in accordance
with Indonesian law. Hence, there is no violation. Claimant avers that the shares
in Bank Century were “in fact worthless by the time of the bailout on 20
November 2008”'8, Hence, on his own case, there could have been no

compensation for worthless shares.

(ii) The Bailout was a permissible preventive measure under Article

10(2){a) of the OIC Agreement

 

 

U8 Paragraph 90 of the Reply.

113

346. Article 10(2)(a) expressly makes it permissible for a state to “adopt preventive
measures issued in accordance with an order from a competent legal authority”.
According to the Respondent, the onus is on the Claimant to prove that the
bailout was not a preventive measure issued in accordance with the order of a
competent legal authority. This he has utterly failed to do. Even in relation to
expropriation clauses without explicit carve outs, tribunals have found that bona
Jide regulatory measures, such as the administration of a failed bank, are outside

the scope of expropriation.

(iii) The Claimant waived his right to object to any bailout, or even
any taking of shares for that matter, by signing the consent for LPS to
take measures necessary in case of failure, in applying to join the LPS

program.

347, The Respondent submits that the fact that the bailout was a preventive measure
expressly mandated by the OIC Agreement as a permissible measure under
Article 10(1)(a) is not the only hurdle in the way of the Claimant’s case. In this
case, he had expressly consented to such a bailout and hence has waived all rights

to object.

348. The Respondent submits that the Claimant consented by signing a statement, on
behalf of FGAH, agreeing ". . . to discharge and submit to LPS any right,
management, and/or any other interest if the bank [Bank Century] becomes a
failed Bank®. As such, the Claimant cannot now object to the bailout or
otherwise claim that it constituted any kind of taking against his will, including

any expropriation.

(b) The bank had negative value at the time of its bailout: Thus no

compensation can be due.

349. The Respondent submits that one of the more curious aspects of the Claimant’s

claim is that he seeks damages for shares in a bank that, by his own admission,

had negative value at the time of the act of which he complains. It is difficult to

understand how any damages could be due to him under those circumstances,

350. According to the Respondent, this is not a contested question, the Claimant
concedes that Bank Century had more liabilities than assets in Noverhber
2008'?°, Common sense suggests that he cannot ask for money that, by his own
admission, he knows did not accrue in his “investment.” He acknowledged this

when he had requested this Tribunal to drop his claim for damages.

351.

eS

The Respondent also submits that, of all the shareholders in Bank Century, only
two have claimed damages as a result of the alleged expropriation in
consequence of the bailout: the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi, exactly the ones who
caused the meltdown. Even Mr. Tantular has registered no objection to the

bailout.

(c) The bailout measure was legal under Indonesian Law

352. The Respondent submits that whether or not the Indonesian Parliament
subsequently chose to ratify the Perpu in December 2008 has no bearing on the

legal validity of the Perpu when it was issued and when it was acted upon.

353. The Respondent submits that the bailout was a legal and binding measure duly
authorized under Indonesian law. If the Parliament did not subsequently ratify
the Perpu that would not invalidate it nor the actions taken under it. The bailout

was legal and permissible as a matter of Indonesian law.

354. According to the Respondent, the Claimant has not presented, and cannot
present, any Indonesian law evidence that provides otherwise. The Perpu, being
the legal instrument that facilitated the bailout, was a valid and legal act under
Indonesian law. It was therefore a permissible measure falling squarely within
Article 10(1)(b) of the OIC Agreement. The onus is on the Claimant to prove

that it is not so, which burden he has clearly failed to discharge.

(d) Bank Indonesia’s supervision of Bank Century was not negligent

355. According to the Respondent, Bank Indonesia identified weaknesses in Bank
Century as early as 2005, immediately after its creation. Those weaknesses led
Bank Indonesia to place Bank Century under enhanced scrutiny. The
Respondent submits that Bank Indonesia spent the next three years exerting its
supervision: extracting promises out of the Claimant and Mr, Rizvi to address
Bank Century’s liquidity problems. They committed to do this on several

occasions, but in fact never did meet these obligations.

356. The Respondent submits that in 2008 the world was facing an economic crisis
and, to address instability in the banking system, Bank Indonesia had requested
approval to issue a blanket guarantee of all deposits, as many other countries
were doing at the time. However, Mr. Jusuf Kalla, the Vice President at the time,
vetoed that idea. Instead, the guarantee ceiling was raised to Rp. 2 billion
(roughly US$ 200,000)"'. Thus, when Bank Century’s situation became
desperate -- and when it became clear that the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi would not
honor their commitments the only options were to shut the bank down or bail it

out.

(i) The Commitment Letters and the AMA are evidence of Bank

Indonesia’s diligence.

357, The Respondent submits that the main issue that Bank Indonesia found with
Bank Century was a lack of liquidity. Obviously that is an undesirable situation
in a bank. Bank Indonesia sought to address -- and redress -- that deficiency by
asking Bank Century’s major shareholders to inject liquidity into the bank. Thus,
the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi signed the first of several commitment letters on 4
October 2005. Four more commitment letters followed: on 5 April 2006; 28
November 2006; 15 October 2008; and 16 November 2008. The Respondent
submits that i) Bank Indonesia had placed Bank Century under special

 

421 R73, chart reproduced from Tempo, Indonesia’s leading news weekly.
116

supervision following an audit immediately after Bank Century’s creation; ii)
Bank Indonesia sought to address the problems it had identified (liquidity issues)
by demanding that the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi find liquid assets for Bank
Century; iii) Bank Indonesia persisted over several years in seeking a solution
from the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi, and; iv) the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi persisted
over several years in stating that they would provide a solution, but defaulted
every time. During this period Bank Century was still maintaining its Capital

Adequacy Ratio at acceptable levels,

358. The Respondent also submits that the Asset Management Agreement (“AMA”),

359,

360.

signed by Telltop Holdings Ltd and Bank Century, which was at the Claimant's
and Rizvi's urgings, likewise constituted part of this supervision regime, The
Claimant and Mr. Rizvi were in possession of a number of Bank Century
instruments. Some of those instruments had been pledged as collateral for loans
that FGAH or other Al Warrag/Rizvi entities were supposed to arrange; others

were held custodially.

According to the Respondent, the purpose of the AMA was to sell these
instruments and to provide Bank Century with cash from.those sales. If the sales
reaped a profit (i.e., more than the face value of the asset(s) sold), then Telltop
would take part of that profit; if the assets were sold at a loss, Bank Century was
entitled to take the difference between the face value and the sale value from an.
account that Telltop had set up at Dresdner Bank in Zurich. In either case,
however, Telltop was paid a management fee, which it took at the outset, in toto.

The AMA was put forward by the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi as a substantial step
in the strategy to ensure Bank Century’s liquidity. Bank Indonesia had
reservations about using a Swiss bank for the deposit of Telltop’s collateral. The
Respondent submits that, when Bank Century sought to call on the funds in the
Dresdner account, it discovered that the funds in the account had been pledged
to another entity 10 secure a loan to FGAH, while the pledge in favor of Bank
Century had never even been filed with Dresdner Bank. The Respondent submits

that this scheme alone shows unquestionable mens rea.

117

362.

363.

364,

365.

The Respondent submits that Bank Indonesia wanted the funds in Indonesia, and
preferably in the currency of Bank Century’s equity, Indonesian Rupiah. It was
for that reason that Bank Indonesia encouraged Bank Century to enter into a
revised AMA in 2008.

According to the Respondent, all these initiatives -- the five commitment letters,
the original and revised AMA -- represent indisputable evidence that Bank
Indonesia was paying very close attention. indeed to Bank Century’s
predicament. These were hardly the actions of a negligent regulator. Had no
action been taken in Noveinber of 2008, neither a bailout nor a shutdown of Bank
Century, then it might well have been said that Bank of Indonesia was negligent.
But appropriate action, in the form of the bailout, was in fact taken before any

depositors could suffer any loss.

The Respondent further submits that the Commitment Letters and the AMA
were in fact binding documents. They constituted obligations which the
Claimant and Mr. Rizvi undertook, and which they failed to complete. Bank

Indonesia is entitled to call them to account for the failure,

{ii) The proximate cause of the bailout was the Claimant’s and Mr.

Rizvi’s own misdeeds, not Mr. Tantular’s.

The Respondent submits that the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi promised Bank
Century, and Bank Indonesia, that they would help address Bank Century’s
liquidity issues. That was the purpose of the commitment letters and of the AMA.
it was also the purported purpose of the various swaps and collateral

arrangements entered into supposedly to secure loans for Bank Century.

The Respondent submits that the asset swaps left Bank Century with less
valuable assets than those it had traded, and did nothing for its liquidity.
Likewise, the collateral that Bank Century pledged to various Rizvi/Al Warraq
entities was of far greater value than the loans it received, if any, in consideration

of the pledged assets.

418

366.

367.

368.

369,

370.

371.

Indeed, in one instance, Bank Century pledged US$ 65 million worth of assets
in order to secure a US$ 40 million loan facility with ABN AMRO Dubai. That
loan facility was never issued to Bank Century, although ABN AMRO did
provide a loan to the Claimant, or one of his companies, secured by soine of
those same assets belonging to Bank Century. In any case, those assets were

never returned to Bank Century.

Furthermore, throughout the period of intensive supervision, Bank Indonesia
attempted repeatedly to recoup those assets for Bank Century, and to ensure that
the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi did their part to improve Bank Century’s liquidity
position through, for example, the commitment letters and the AMA.

The Respondent snbmits that the worst that might be said of Bank Indonesia is
that it was naive to believe that the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi would do what they
promised numerons times, yet failed repeatedly, to do. Reasonable central
bankers could differ on their approach. According to the Respondent, the
Claimant and Mr. Rizvi had no intention of ever returning the assets they had

taken from Bank Century.

The Respondent alleges that the root cause of Bank Century’s ills was the
Claimant’s and Mr. Rizvi's own actions. According to the Respondent, it is an
uncontested fact that the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi held custody of some US$ 300
million of Bank Century’s assets, in the form of securities, which they have not
returned to this day. In either event, Bank Century was left with a huge hole in

its finances.

The Respondent argues that even if Mr, Tantular had been stopped before he
caused any damage, the impact of the Claimant’s and Mr. Rizvi’s activities were
large enough in themselves to render Bank Century insolvent. In fact, it was the
condition of Bank Century resulting from the tremendous drainage of its assets
by the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi that put that bank on the brink of failure.

The bailout therefore had to occur, irrespective of anything Mr. Tantular did.
And even if the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi were handling Bank Century’s assets

119

372.

373.

374,

375.

376,

with the best of intentions, the fact that Bank Century was deprived of those
assets, and of cash to substitute for them, particularly in the midst of a world
economic crisis, was in itself sufficient to cause the liquidity crisis that resulted

in the bailout.

The Respondent also submits that the nature of Mr. Tantular’s crimes was
different from the activities of the Claimant and Mr, Rizvi, The former’s
misdeeds, for the most part, consisted of circumventing various banking and
depository regulations and procedures, allowing certain depositors, including his
own entities, to recoup funds that ought to have remained within the bank during

the period of special surveillance.

As such, Mr. Tantular’s offense, though damaging to Bank Century’s liquidity,
was less so than the various schemes that the Claimant and Mr, Rizvi undertook
with Bank Century’s proprietary trading assets. After all, the funds released to

the depositors by Mr. Tantular did in fact belong to those depositors.

Bank Indonesia’s inability to prevent Mr, Tantular’s crimes was not the
proximate cause of the bailout. It may well be that Bank Indonesia’s indulgence
of the Claimant’s and Mr. Rizvi’s repeated, broken promises to help recapitalize

the bank contributed to the need for the bailout.

The Respondent submits that it is not in any case clear what more Bank
Indonesia could have done to prevent further improper conduct of Mr, Tantular,
or further embezzlements by the Claimant and Rizvi, over and above insisting
upon them rectifying those acts already committed, short of shutting down the
bank entirely or taking over its management, which latter it eventually did

through the bailout.

(iii) There is no basis from which to conclude that there was a breach

of the OIC Agreement’s “adequate protection and security” clause

The Respondent argues that international standards of protection in treaties are

limits jointly self-imposed by contracting states. The onus is on the inyestor to

120

377.

378.

379.

prove that the alleged state conduct rises to the high threshold of an international

wrong”,

The Contracting Parties to the OIC Agreement, as evidenced by the text,
intended that customary international law standards for minimum standard of
treatment of aliens would apply to its provisions. Paragraph 7 of the preamble
makes plain that standards set out in the treaty were intended to provide only the
“minimum in dealing with the capitals and investments coming in from the

Member States.”

The Respondent submits that the Claimant's case is that allegedly negligent
supervision by Bank Indonesia failed to detect fraud by Mr. Tantular, which, he
claims, caused the collapse of Bank Century and left the shares worthless. The
first element of that claim is that the duty of care must be owed to the Claimant.
Bank Indonesia owes its regulatory duties to the depositors, not to portfolio
investors. The Claimant held the office of Deputy President of the Board of
Commissioners and Mr. Tantular was his business partner. In fact, it was the
Claimant’s duty as the Deputy President of the Board of Commissioners to

supervise the Bank and to detect any misconduct. This he failed to do,

The Respondent further submits that Article 2 is a promise to provide physical
protection and security that is adequate in the circumstances. It does not apply
to regulatory conduct. According to the Respondent, even if the applicable
standard were the “full protection and security” standard common to a “regular”
BIT, it would not exceed the duty of care found in customary international law.
The high point of the duty is to provide no more than a reasonable measure of
prevention, which a well administered government could be expected to exercise

in similar circumstances.

4. THE CLAIMANT’S FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT CLAIM

A. The Claimant

380.

The Claimant submits the following:

i) The Claimant is entitled to fair and equitable treatment through the most favoured

nation clause at Artiele 8 of the OIC Agreement.

381.

382.

383.

Article 8 of the OIC Agreement contains a most favoured nations clause that

provides as follows:

“(t]he Investors of any contracting party shall enjoy, within the context of
economic activity in which they have employed their investments in the
territories of another contracting party, a treatment not less favourable
than the treatment accorded to investors belonging to another State not
party to this Agreement, in the context of that activity and in respect of

rights and privileges accorded to those investors”.

The Claimant claims that Article 8 entitles him to import provisions from, infer
alia, the BIT between the United Kingdom and Indonesia which provides more
favourable treatment to foreign investors than the OIC agreement, so long as
certain conditions are met. Specifically, Article 8 provides that the “treatment”
must be in the “context of economic activity in which [the investors] have
employed their investments in the territories of another contracting party” and
“Gn the context of that activity and in respect of rights and privileges accorded

to those investors.”

The OIC Agreement does not include a provision requiring the Respondent to
provide fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) to the Claimant. It is also
undisputed that Article 3 of the Agreement between the Government of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Jreland and the Government of
the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments
(“UK-Indonesia BIT”) does require that investors “af all times be accorded fair
and equitable treatment.” As a result, the MEN clause of the OIC Agreement

122

384.

385.

386,

3 CLAI79

entitles the Claimant to the more favourable fair and equitable treatment afforded

to investors by the UK-Indonesia BIT.

Inresponse to the Claimant’s submissions on this point in his Statement of Claim
and his Reply, the Respondent has advanced several meritless arguments. The
Respondent claims that the OIC Agreement “restricts MFN treatment strictly to
the context of the same economic activity” as that protected by other treaties.
Both the UK-Indonesia BIT and the OIC Agreement were entered into for the
purpose of encouraging and protecting foreign investment. The Claimant
submits that the Respondent fails to explain how the Claimant’s economic
activity is in any way different from the economic activity covered by the UK-
Indonesia BIT or any other bilateral investment treaty which the Claimant has

chosen to invoke.

The Respondent also accuses the Claimant of “cherry pickfing] provisions from
other investment treaties into the OIC Agreement,” and importing obligations
from other treaties carte blanche. According to the Claimant, this argument also
fails, as the Claimant only seeks to import those protections afforded to
similarly-situated nationals of third-party states. The Respondent’s reference to
Article 8(2)(b) of the OIC Agreement is even less persuasive. Article 8(2)(b) is
irrelevant to the present set of facts, as it only applies when the investor seeks to
enforce the Respondent’s obligations from treaties under which an economic
union, customs union, or mutual tax exemption is in place. The Claimant submits

that this is clearly not the case for him,

Moreover, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant may not import provisions
from the UK-Indonesia BIT because his investment was not “granted
admission” in accordance with the BKPM-administered admissions process.
This argument ignores the fundamental purpose of the MFN clause. The purpose
is to create a level playing field among foreign investors and to import
obligations from third-party treaties to give effect to that purpose!3, The

Respondent’s argument suggests that the MFN clause acts to import all

123

obligations imposed upon the Claimant from the UK-Indonesia BIT. The
Claimant claims that this is simply not true, as the MFN acts to import only those

provisions that are “more favourable” to the foreign investor.

387, Nonetheless, even if the Claimant’s investment was required to be admitted
under by BKPM, the Respondent’s argument still fails, The tribunal in Rafat Ali
Rizvi v. Republic of Indonesia found that the BKPM-administered process is not
a requirement for the admission of foreign investments in the banking sector and
that investments under the UK-Indonesia BIT are not required to have gone
through a BKPM administered admission process in order to gain the protection

of the treaty!?4.

388.

2

The Respondent’s argument that the Claimant’s investment was not granted
admission under Indonesian law fails for the additional reason that the UK-
Indonesia BIT is not the only BIT in which the Respondent has agreed to accord
fair and equitable treatment to foreign investments. As a result, even if the
Claimant has not met obligations that it is somehow required to meet under the
UK-Indonesia BIT, as the Respondent suggests, the Claimant is still entitled to
import the fair and equitable treatment protection from several other BITs to

which Indonesia is a party.

389. The Claimant refers to different BITs with Indonesia, for example, the
Netherlands-Indonesia BIT which provides that the Respondent shall “ensure
fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of [the Netherlands]

and shall not impair, by unreasonably or discriminatory measures, the

 

operation, i use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by
those nationals.”"> This BIT does not specifically limit the scope of the treaty
to those investments “granted admission in accordance with the Foreign
Investment Law.” Additionally, the Singapore-Indonesia BIT provides that

“investors shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment,”! while

(ii) | The Respondent’s breach of its pr ‘ial and i igative powers

mentioning nothing about a mandatory admissions process. Moreover, the India-
Indonesia BIT provides that “investments and returns of investors of each
Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment in

the territory of the other Contracting Party?"7

The Claimant submits that the Respondent has chosen to focus solely on
provisions of the UK-Indonesia BIT, ignoring the numerous other treaties in
which Indonesia has agreed to accord fair and equitable treatment to foreign
investments. As a result, the Claimant is entitled to FET protection through the

OIC Agreement’s MIN clause, and the Respondent’s argument fails.

ted

to a denial of fair and equitable treatment

391.

392.

393.

The Claimant claims that he was the victim of a series of actions taken by the
Indonesian authorities that destroyed all possibility of a fair trial. The measures
taken in the criminal investigation and the subsequent prosecution amounted to

a denial of fair and equitable treatment as recognized by several arbitral awards.

The Claimant claims that he has suffered from a series of procedural
irregularities, corrupt practices, and arbitrary and discriminatory measures that
were detrimental to his investment and resulted in a denial of fair and equitable

treatment.

The Claimant further submits that the AGO issued several inflammatory
statements in which it accused the Claimant of being a fugitive from justice, even
though he was never a resident of Indonesia!®, The Jakarta Court summons was
also inadequate, and as a result the Claimant was denied the opportunity to
defend himself. The Claimant also claims that the Indonesian authorities also
engaged in a variety of corrupt acts, including two separate solicitations of bribes

in order to drop the criminal investigation and prosecution and a politically

motivated abuse of the INTERPOL Red Notice system in issuing Red Notices

relating to the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi,

The Claimant further claims that, in addition to the discriminatory and corrupt
measures leading up to the criminal trial, the trial and the judgment themselves
contained several deficiencies resulting in an outright denial of due process.
First, the Respondent failed to provide and effectively serve proper summonses
in accordance with international and Indonesian law, yet the trial was
nevertheless conducted in absentia'?®, Second, both the corruption and money
laundering charges were wholly unsubstantiated. The Claimant was charged
with the “purchase of commercial papers which have na rating and are not
registered in any stock exchange by unlawfully using the money of P.T, Bank
Century.” But the Criminal Court failed to provide any description of the
commercial papers, their price, how and when they were purchased, and how the

Claimant unlawfully used Bank Century’s money!!.

Furthermore, the Claimant claims that the Jakarta District Criminal Court
Verdict was also contradictory, at times using the worthlessness of the securities
as the basis for the Claimant’s liability, and at other times asserting that the
Claimant had enriched himself, and that he somehow used the allegedly
worthless securities as collateral for loans!**, Moreover, the Jakarta Court
Verdict failed to provide the basis for two crucial elements of a corruption
offence: (1) a finding that the defendant had enriched himself; and (2) a finding
that the defendant’s actions caused Joss to the state. The Claimant, the money
laundering charge was equally problematic. The Jakarta Court Verdict did not
specify the commercial papers that it accused the Claimant of hiding, nor did it

present evidence of how the Claimant hid such papers",

The Claimant submits that the Indonesian authorities in the Claimant’s case

repeatedly solicited bribes, the Jakarta Court wrongfully conducted a trial iz

absentia and the Court’s judgment had no evidentiary basis. The extent of the
procedural irregularities indicates that Indonesian authorities were aware of the
harm their measures could cause to the Claimant as a foreign investor, yet they
took no steps to “assess or to avoid, minimize, or mitigate that possibility of
harm”. As a result the Respondent’s unreasonable and discriminatory measures
amount to a denial of due process and a breach of the fair and equitable treatment

standard.

B. The Respondent

i) The OIC Agreement does not provide for “fair and equitable treatment,” and the

Claimant in any event was not treated unfairly

397.

39

3

399.

The Respondent submits that Article 8 of the OIC Agreement restricts MFN
treatment strictly to the context of the same economic activity, It envisions that
the host state must not favor investments from third states over those from a
Contracting State, in the context of a particular economic activity. It does not
grant an investor carte blanche to selectively import obligations from the

universe of treaties signed by Indonesia.

. According to the Respondent, the limitation in Article 8 that the MEN treatment

only applies withm the context of the same economic activity illustrates the
limited scope of this article. It is different from a typical MFN clause found in
BITs that do not contain such a limitation. Even so, there is considerable debate
in allowing investors to use MFN provisions to cherry-pick guarantees from

other treaties without taking into account the restrictions that come with them.

In fact, had Claimant's (or FGAH's) investment, been made by a national or legal
entity of the UK, it would not be entitled to protection of the UK-Indonesia BIT
at all. Article 2(1} of the UK-Indonesia BIT limits the scope of application of
that treaty only to: ".,, iavestments hy nationals or companies of the UK.... in

the territory of Indonesia that have been granted admission in accordance with

127

400.

401.

402,

403,

the Foreign Investment Law, No. J of 1967, or any law amending or replacing

it”

The Respondent further submits that investments made in accordance with the
Foreign Investment Laws are granted admission through application to and
approval by the Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (the “BKPM”). They
must be made by establishing an Indonesian foreign investment company
(Penanaman Modal Asing, "PMA") to operate the intended project. This does
not apply to publicly-listed companies, such as Bank Century, nor to investments
in the banking sector at all (as banks may not be established as PMA companies).
Since investors in the banking and capital markets sector do not benefit from

BIT protections, there is no compatison here to be made at all.

Nor did the Claimant or any of his colleagues make any application to BKPM
for admission of their investment, or claim to have done so. Thus, under the
MIN clause in the OIC Agreement, neither the Claimant's nor FGAH's
“investment” would be entitled to any protection under the UK-Indonesia BIT.
This limitation is found in virtually every BIT entered into by Indonesia,

Furthermore, the Respondent submits that even if the Claimant were somehow
able to invoke the protections under the UK-Indonesia BIT, or any other similar
treaty, the FET provisions invariably afford fair and equitable treatment to the
qualified investments of qualified investors, not to the person of the investors
themselves. FET clauses provide the guarantee to the investments only and not
to investors who, in their own right, became subject to criminal prosecution.
Thus, even ifthe Claimant could rely upon an FET provision it would not assist
his case that challenges the criminal prosecution and conviction of his person,
This is not an issue relating to his investment, if any, but to the criminality of his

conduct.

The Respondent also submits that even if the Claimant could somehow invoke
the FET clause, particularly that in the UK-Indonesia BIT, his claim would fail
on the facts because his colleague, Mr. Rafat Ali Rizvi, a UK subject, was

afforded exactly the same treatment for exactly the same activities and crimes as

128

was the Claimant. Therefore, even if the Claimant could import an FET standard,
the Respondent’s conduct does not come even close to a breach of this treatment

guarantee.

404, According to the Respoudent, the fair and equitable treatment standard does not
go beyond what is required by the customary international law minimum
standard of treatment of aliens, International law sets a high standard for a state’s
conduct to breach fair and equitable treatment. It must be egregious and
shocking, and this must be blatantly apparent to any reasonable person. It is a
serious charge to accuse a state of committing an international wrong or

delinquency.

405, The Claimant accuses the Indonesian Court’s decision of being unfair and unjust.
This is a grave charge against the independent judiciary of one of the world’s
largest democracies. The principle of comity alone requires this Tribunal to
assume that the Indonesian Court has acted properly unless the Claimant proves
that there has been a glaring disregard of due process by the Court. And even if
the Indonesian Court had denied the Claimant due process, which it certainly
had not, the Claimant did not exhaust his remedies in local law. Where he has

failed to do so, there can be no claim for denial of justice.

406. The Respondent submits that the Claimant not only refused to appear at his own
trial, but also has made no attempt to appeal the verdict of the Indonesian Court,
where a robust and effective appeals procedure was, and still is, available to him.
Nor has the Claimant provided a legal opinion of an Indonesian law expert that
supports his view. The Claimant’s refusal to participate in the trial, and indeed

to appeal the conviction, cannot be excused.

(ii) The Claimant's treatment was fully just and fair, in accordance with proper

procedures

407. The Respondent submits that the shareholders and management who were
discovered to be at fault in draining off the liquidity of Bank Century were all
tried equally and properly in fair and open judicial proceedings fully in

129

accordance with Indonesian Jaw and practice, following proper applicable

procedures.

408. According to the Respondent, the Claimant was notified through every
conceivable means of the investigation and was invited to attend and explain
what he understood of the situation to assist in the investigation. He ignored a
series of summonses and as a result became a suspect and was indicted, He was
then served even more times through even more channels, including in each
instance diplomatic channels, business address, last known residence address,
press publication, but failed to appear or even send counsel to appear on his
behaif, throughout.

409. Meanwhile the full judicial process continued, first with a series of hearings only
to determine whether he was properiy notified and given an opportunity to
present his case and, as was finally decided, the matter should go on in absentia.
Several statements of expert and factual witnesses are presented with this

submission to substantiate the properness of the judicial process employed",

410. The Respondent submits that the Claimant cannot truthfully say that he was not
served, nor aware of the proceedings. He was fully aware of them, as he
appointed legal counsel for the sole purpose of attending the court hearings and
taking notes to report back to him. It is telling that the Claimant has neglected to
advise the Tribunal of this fact. He disclosed it in the Hong Kong proceedings,
but not in these.1o1 He has also refused, when requested in the Discovery Process,

to disclose the identity of such counsel or provide the text of the notes provided.

411. Furthermore, the Respondent alleges that on the eve of the commencement of
his criminal trial, the Claimant sent a representative to Jakarta to try to persuade

the Attorney General to drop the case.

412. An offer was made by Mr. Pallett, on behalf of the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi, in
the amount of US $ 220 million, approximately one third of the bailout funds, or

130

approximately two thirds of the amount tle prosecutors had been able to provide

sufficient evidence to seek int the trial!?®,

413, The Deputy Attorney General and the prosecutor with whom this representative
(Ernest Pallett) met explained that if the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi were to return
the state's losses in their entirety, or at least in the amount for which proof was
being presented in the criminal case as having been purloined, the Attorney
General would be able to ask for clemency, although the case was too far along

to even discuss dismissal?®

414. The Respondent submits that not only the Prosecutor but also the counsel who
brought the Claimant's representative to the Prosecutor urged that the Claimant
appear, or at least engage counsel to appear, on his behalf, at the trial and put
forward his defense (the defense was understood to be that at least 1/3 of the
liability should fall upon Mr. Tantular and thus that the liability of the Claimant
and Mr. Rizvi should be proportionately reduced).

415. The Respondent further submits that neither the Claimant's representative nor
anyone else at this stage was contending that the Claimant was innocent of the
charges against him. In fact, it appears that his guilt was taken as a given by all,

including his own representatives and counsel.

416, Despite being urged by all to do the right thing, the Claimant chose to absent
himself from the entire proceeding. But he did want to know what was going on,
thus he sent a lawyer to attend the hearings and “take notes". It is telling that
with all the misinformation from various ignorant media reports the Claimant
has inundated us with, and the interminable witness statements describing what
his foreign witnesses, who have no first-hand knowledge of the situation, see as
the Indonesian judicial and political environment (none of which disputes the
faimess of the process as applied) the Claimant has neglected even to mention

that he had a legal representative sitting in the court day after day and reporting

to him, presumably night after night, let alone share with us what was reported

The trial went on for six months, during which all evidence that could be found,
all that had not already been removed and hidden or destroyed by the Claimant
and his partners, was presented and analysed. It is all summarized in the court
judgment!?’, outlined in Detective Senior Inspector R.J.C. Harding's First
Affirmation dated 15 December 2010 to the High Court of Hong Kong in Jn the
Matter of the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance Cap. 525
and In the Matter of Rafat Ali Rizvi, Hesham Talaat Mohamed Al-Warrag et al
HCMP No. 2557/2010.

418, The Respondent submits that the Claimant intentionally chose not to put any
evidence before the Court in his own defense. He was notified of the whole of
the judgment, not only informally by his note taking counsel but also officially
by the Court.

419. Furthermore, the Claimant’s home state, Saudi Arabia, has respected the
Indonesian Court’s judgment against its own citizen. According to the Claimant
himself, it has imposed among other things, travel restrictions. It is obvious that
the Saudi government credits the Indonesian Court’s conclusion that the

Claimant is a criminal.

420. The Respondent submits that if the Claimant sincerely believed that the
judgment was incorrect or unfair, he had every opportunity to file an appeal.
Appeal to the High Court is the proper remedy for anyone not satisfied with a
court judgment. Such appeal is open to all parties, in any civil or criminal case,
provided notice of intention to file appeal is given within 7 days of the day the
judgment is notified to such party. Clearly, there is no evidence of “futility”

regarding the administration of justice in Indonesia.

2010, is attached as Exhibit R 45
138 See Exhibit C53, Affirmation of RJC Harding in particular paragraphs 13-17.

132

421. According to the Respondent, the Claimant had ample opportunity to appeal. He

chose not to do so. Even after the time had passed to seek appeal to the High
Court, the Claimant still had the time and opportunity to apply to the Supreme
Court for the recourse of last resort: Judicial Review (Peninjauan Kembali,

"PK"). In fact he may still do so. But this he has also chosen not to do.

5. THE CLAIMANT’S PROTECTION AND SECURITY CLAIM UNDER ARTICLE 2 OF
THE OIC

A. The Claimant

422,

The Claimant claims the following:

(i) There is no substantive difference between the standards of “adequate protection

and security” and “full protection and security”.

423.

424,

Article 2 of the OIC Agreement provides that the “invested capital shall enjoy
adequate protection and security.” The Claimant submits that tribunals have
been called upon to interpret treaties referring to “full protection and security,”
“most constant protection and security,” and simply “protection and security.”
here is no indication that such variations impose different degrees of protection,
as argued by the Respondent. Tribunals and scholars have repeatedly affirmed
that “arbitration practice does not seem to attach a significant importance to the
wording of the applicable treaty in the interpretation of the obligation of
granting full protection and security.” Accordingly, the Tribunal should find that
“adequate protection and security” is the same standard as “full protection and

security.”

According to the Claimant, even if “adequate protection and security” is in fact
a lower standard, then pursuant to the most-favoured-nation clause (“MIN”)
clause at Article 8 of the OIC Agreement, the Claimant is entitled to import the
higher standard of “full protection and security” from Article 3(2) of the UK-

Indonesia BIT or any other treaty to which Indonesia is a party.

133

(ii) “Adequate protection and security” extends to protection against the instabilities

of the legal and business environment

425, The Respondent claims that adequate protection and security is restricted to the
promise of physical protection and security only. The language of the OIC
Agreement provides for no such limitation. The Claimant relies on six recent
ICSID decisions"? that according to the Claimant, rejected the Respondent’s
position, finding that full protection and security extends to providing a stable

and secure investment environment.

426. The Claimant submits that given the plain language of the OIC Agreement and
the support from other awards, the Tribunal should find that “adequate
protection and security” applies to regulatory and supervisory protection and

security as well as protection of physical assets,

{iii) The obligation to provide adequate protection and security applies not only to the

Claimant’s investment but also to the Respondent’s treatment of the Claimant.

427. The Respondent claims that the “protection and security” provision of Article 2
of the OIC Agreement applies only to the investment, and not to the investor,
According to the Claimant, such a limitation has been rejected in the awards of

several tribunals.

428. The Claimant submits that, in the present case the Claimant has showed the
Respondent’s illegal conduct by both its investigative and prosecutorial
authorities, as well as its application of criminal legislation in a discriminatory
manner, Both of the claims demonstrate that the host State has failed to “properly
examine” his case in a way that would “vindicate his rights.” A “functioning

court system” was not made available to the investor. The Respondent offers no
support for the premise that a “fimctioning court system” applies only to claims
brought by the investor. The Claimant claims that the Respondent has levied an
arbitrary, discriminatory, and illegal criminal judgment against the Claimant. In

doing so it has deprived the Claimant of his right to a functioning court system.

The Claimant also submits that he has demonstrated that the Respondent’s
investigative and prosecutorial authorities engaged in illegal conduct by failing
to properly serve him with notice of the criminal proceedings and by soliciting
corrupt payments. Additionally, the Claimant has shown that the Respondent
applied its criminal legislation to the Claimant in a discriminatory manner.
Moreover, the Claimant was denied the right to a functioning court system, as
the verdict of the Central Jakarta District Court was tainted by corruption and

the denial of due process.

Moreover, the Claimant submits that he has demonstrated through his written
and oral submissions that the Respondent was negligent in its supervisory role
over Bank Century, thereby causing harm to the Claimant’s investment. The
Respondent’s negligent regulatory supervision allowed Mr. Tantular to
embezzle over USD 300 million of Bank Century’s funds, placing the bank on
the brink of collapse and depriving the Claimant of any meaningful use of his

investment,

B. The Respondent

431.

432.

The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s assumption that “full” protection
and security is the same as “adequate” protection and security cannot hold up
under any interpretation of those terms, in any language. Article 2 provides for
“adequate” protection and security. It is obvious that this was intended to impose

a Jower standard than the adjective “full”.

The Respondent further submits that the Claimant also takes it for granted that

the protection and security standard extends to regulatory measures. According

135

433,

434,

435,

436,

437.

to the Respondent several tribunals, have confirmed that this provision is

restricted to the promise of physical protection and security only.

The Respondent argues that the Claimant has not shown in this case that the

dequate p ion and security dard applies to regulatory acts. He does not
explain the standard this obligation places upon a host state in regulating its
banking sector. Nor does he specify in what way he deems the Respondent to

have breached this obligation.

Moreover, the Claimant has not pointed to a single law or regulation that the
Respondent has violated, nor provided any evidence of the same, The fact that
the Claimant claims that he expected Bank Indonesia to detect the cleverly
concealed corrupt practices of his coconspirators, to say nothing of his own

mnisdeeds, is in itself telling of the ridiculous nature of his allegation.

The Claimant also faces the additional hurdle of arguing that the Government
failed to protect him not only from himself, but also from the acts of a third party,
in the person of Mr. Tantular. It should be noted, however, that in this case, Mr.
Tantular was no ordinary third party, he was the Claimant’s chosen business
partner and supposed co-conspirator. The Claimant asserts that he knew, or
believed, Mr. Tantular to be “blacklisted” by Bank Indonesia, yet he opted to do
business with him, and indeed co-signed a letter of commitment with him. It was

a risk he assumed.

The Respondent submits that the Claimant has anyone besides himself and Mr.
Rizvi to blame, it is his chosen business partner. There is no evidence to support
the allegation that Indonesia encouraged, fostered or contributed in any way to
the acts allegedly committed by Mr. Tantular. He is the Claimant’s accomplice,

not a random third party.

The Claimant also alleges, that the Respondent failed to ensure adequate
protection and security to “... the Claimant himself in the criminal proceedings
arising out of the nationalization of Bank Century; in breach of Article 2 of the
OIC Agreement.” It is obvious that Article 2 is very clear in saying that “the

136

6.

invested capital shall enjoy adequate protection and security.” \t does not
provide for the protection of the investor himself, in particular in relation to
protecting his person from criminal prosecution when he commits acts contrary

to domestic law.

‘THE RESPONDENT’S COUNTERCLAIM

A. The Respondent

I.

@

Gi)

The Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide on the Respondent’s Counterclaim

Article 9 of the OIC Agreement provides a basis for the counterclaim,

438.

439.

440.

The Respondent submits that Article 9 of the OIC Agreement does more than
merely limit the right of an investor to claim redress only to when he is in
compliance with certain standards of behavior and good order; it also commits

him to assume liability for any breaches thereof in arbitration,

According to the Respondent, the language of Article 9 demonstrates that the
provision is intended to serve as more than a bar to certain claims; it is an
affirmative commitment by an investor who seeks protection of the treaty to
abide by certain obligations in respect of his conduct. Failure to do carries
consequences, Article 9 reads: “The investor shall be bound by the laws and
regulations in force in the host state and shall refrain from all acts that may
disturb public order or morals or that may be prejudicial to the public interest.
He is also to refrain from exercising restrictive practices and from trping to

achieve gains through unlawful means.” (emphasis added)

The Respondent submits that the Claimant has not met those obligations. If he
chooses, as he has done, to bring a claim against Indonesia, he must be prepared
for the eventuality that Indonesia would reciprocate, and in fact so acknowledged

in writing in the 25 November 201 [ letter agreement.

Article 17 of the OIC Agreement likewise contemplates counterclaims

137

441. The Respondent submits that Article 17 of the OIC Agreement likewise clearly
indicates that counterclaims are to be treated similarly to, and along with, main
claims. In contrast to the language of several Bilateral Investment Treaties,
which limit the class of claimants to investors only, the OIC Agreement is

decidedly neutral in its language concerning who may bring an arbitration:

“Tf the two parlies to the dispute do not reach an agreement as a result of
their resort to conciliation, or if the conciliator is unable to issue his report
within the prescribed period, or if the two parties do not accept the
solutions proposed therein, then each party has the right io resort to the
Arbitration Tribunal for a final decision on the dispute. (emphasis added)
(Article 17(2){a))”.

442, Furthermore, Article 17 (2) (d) anticipates that awards will be rendered against
Investors. It says: “The contracting parties are under an obligation to implement
them in their territory, no matter whether it be a party to the dispute or not and
whether the investor against whom the decision was passed is one of its
nationals or residents or not, as if it were a final and enforceable decision of its
national courts.” (emphasis added)

443. It would have been a simple matter for the drafters to limit the scope of
arbitration to claims by investors. Indeed, in Article 16, the drafters specifically
refer to the rights of the investor with respect to recourse in the courts of the host

state.

444, The Respondent argues that had they intended that arbitration under the OIC
Agreement be similarly one sided, one imagines they would likewise have
referred only to the ability of investors to bring it. Instead, they chose the words:
“each party has the right to resort to the Arbitration Tribunal for a final decision

on the dispute”, as well as making reference to enforcement against an investor.

(iii) The UNCITRAL Rules, which are applicable to this arbitration, permit
counterclaims

138

445. This arbitration is conducted under the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, by

agreement of the Parties, and accepted by this Tribunal.

446. The Respondent submits that Article 21.3 of the UNCITRAL Rules explicitly

and unambiguously permits the filing of counterclaims:

“In its statement of defence, or at a later stage in the arbitral proceedings
if the arbitral tribunal decides that the delay was justified under the
circumstances, the respondent may make a counterclaim or rely ona claim
for the purpose of a set-off provided that the arbitral tribunal has

jurisdiction over it”.

(iv) The Claimant’s own legal representatives consented to counterclaims in the
arbitration agreement

447, The Respondent also submits that the Claimant explicitly consented to
counterclaims through his counsel. The Parties’ letter of agreement of 25
November 2011 provides that:

“Uf the Tribunal rules in favour of your client in relation to the preliminary
objections’ application, any further jurisdictional or admissibility
objections, the merits and any counterclaim will be submitted to the same

Tribunals

448. The Respondent argues that there is no room for ambiguity in that formulation,
despite the Claimant's counsel's assertion at the Final Hearing that although they
had agreed that the Respondent could bring its counterclaim before this Tribunal
in the present arbitration, that did not imply that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to

hear it!!!

re
4! Transcript, 10 March, page 535: line 5.

 

139

449. The Respondent submits that the Parties agreed on the scope and manner of

arbitration and one clear agreement was Indonesia’s ability to bring a
counterclaim if the Claimant’s claim survived the jurisdictional phase. Thus, by
determining that it has jurisdiction to hear the Claimant's claim, this Tribunal

also determined that it has jurisdiction to hear Respondent's counterclaim.

(vy) Indonesia is not claiming the same damages as in the criminal judgment

450. The Respondent submits that the principal substantive argument that the

451.

Claimant raised against Indonesia’s counterclaim was that it constituted an
attempt to recoup the same damages as the Jakarta court found that Mr. Al
Warraq owed to Bank Century. As such, claims the Claimant, the counterclaim

violates the international law principle of ne bis in idem.

It is certainly true that the monies that the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi were
convicted of having taken from Bank Century amount to approximately the same
sum as the assets for which Indonesia seeks redress in its counterclaim. The
jurisdictional basis for the prosecution and the counterclaim, however, are

entirely different.

452. The Jakarta Court convicted the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi of money laundering

and corruption — criminal offenses.

453. The Respondent also submits that the jurisdictional basis for the counterclaim,

by contrast, is Article 9 of the OIC Agreement. For the reasons set forth above,
Article 9 obligates an investor to abide by certain standards of morality and good

order, and not to attempt to enrich himself by unlawful means as follow:
“Indonesia's claims in this arbitration are for Al Warraq’s unjustly

enriching himself (OIC Article 9), at the cost of the state, and her

taxpayers”.

140

454, The Claimant and Mr. Rizvi took well in excess of US$ 300 million of Bank
Century assets and converted them to their own use and possession. The
Respondent submits that unjust enrichinent is hardly a model of morality and

good order, nor could this have been done in good faith.

(vi) The Counterclaim does not violate the rule of ne bis in idem

455. ‘The Respondent submits that, under the principle of ne bis in idem, a person shall
not be prosecuted more than once for the same criminal conduct. The principle
is found in various legal jurisdictions and is incorporated in Article 14(7) of the
ICCPR which provides that “{njo one shail be liable to be tried or punished
again for an offence for which he has already been finally convicted or acquitted
in accordance with the law and penal procedure of each country.” Ne bis in idem

prevents the Claimant to be tried again for the same criminal offense.

456. The Respondent submits that in its counterclaim, Indonesia does not seek to re-
prosecute the Claimant for his criminal offense. Nor does this Tribunal have any
criminal jurisdiction. The counterclaim is based on a civil matter that is, the
Claimant’s breach of Article 9 of the OIC Agreement. Such breach is not a
criminal offense, and thus the counterclaim does not violate the rule of ne bis in
idem.

457. The basis of the unjust enrichment claim is the failure to honor the Commitment
Letters and the AMA, not specifically the criminal theft of assets. It should be
patently clear that the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi defrauded and embezzled their
way to wealth, by tricking Bank Century, as well as Bank Indonesia, into
believing that they would redeem or repay Bank Century assets which they

ultimately retained.

458. The Respondent submits that, whoever was responsible for the shortfall in Bank
Century assets, it was the Claimant, in concert with Mr. Rizvi, who promised,
and committed to Bank Indonesia, to recapitalize the bank. ‘They failed to do so.
And more: they manipulated to their own advantage the securities that they were

entrusted to sell, As such, they enriched themselves directly at Bank Century’s

141

expense. It fell to the Indonesian government, through the LPS, to make up the
shortfall, This was a direct breach of Article 9 of the OIC Agreement.

2, Indonesia is entitled to more than US$ 300 million in damages from the Claimant

@ The actions of the Claimant, together with Mr. Rizvi, were the proximate cause of
Bank Century’s insolvency and the need for the bailout

459. The Respondent submits that, even without Mr. Tantular’s misdeeds, Bank

Century was insolvent in November 2008, It needed a bailout.

460. The Respondent submits that, because both the Commitment Letters and the

461,

AMA were binding, the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi were legally responsible for
enforcing their terms. By failing to do so, by holding on to Bank Century's assets
rather than either selling them (as required under the AMA) or returning them
(as required under the Commitment Letters), the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi ended
up more than US$ 300 million better off than they ought to have been, all to the
loss of Bank Century and ultimately the people of the Republic of Indonesia.

1. Loss of value through AMA

The AMA structure is straightforward. Bank Century entrusted just over US$
200 million (US$ 203.4 million) in assets to Telltop Holdings, a British Virgin
Islands vehicle of the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi. Telltop Holdings, the Manager in

the Agreement, warranted to Bank Century (the "Bank" in the AMA) as follows;

5.1 The Manager hereby warrants that the Bank shall realize from the
disposal of each of the assets an amount which is at least the Face Value
of each of the Assets by the respective maturity dates listed in Schedule 1

herein.

5.2 As security for the warranty in clause 5.1 herein, the Manager shall
within seven (7) days of the Commencement Date (or such other date as

the parties may agree), place a sum of US$220,000,000 at its bank account

142

at Dresdner Bank (Switzerland), Zurich (the “Security Deposit”) and shall
execute all documents effecting a pledge to Dresdner Bank of the Security
Deposit in favour of the Bank, in accordance to the form set out in
Schedule 4 herein. 5.3 In the event that the amount realized from the
disposal of any of the Assets is less than the Face of that Asset, the Bank
shall be entitled to deduct from the Security Deposit the Shortfall. For this
purpose, “Shortfall” means the difference between (i) the amount received
by the Bank from the disposal of, and dividends and interest arising from,
that Asset and

(ii) the total of the Face Value of that Asset and the expenses af the Bank
in respect of such realization and tax charges which would be payable by
the Bank, if any. In the event that fan] Asset listed has a maturity date
longer than the pledge, the Bank shail be entitled to deduct the Security
Deposit for the same amount as the Face Value of the Asset on or before

the maturity date of the pledge.

462. According to the Respondent, Telltop was entitled to take a commission on every
transaction, and in fact took the entire amount at the outset, before any
transaction was made. And as an inducement to selling the assets for the highest
possible price, Telltop was also entitled to a "profit share" of 20% of any sums
it recouped-over and above the Face Value of an asset!*?,

463. The Respondent submits that, by the expiration date of the AMA, in February
2009, not one of Bank Century’s assets had been sold. It was then that Bank
Century sought to recoup the Security Deposit in Dresdner Bank, in accordance
with the AMA, only to find that the whole of such deposit had been pledged to
another entity having no relation to Bank Century or Indonesia, and that no
pledge in favor of Bank Century had been registered with or delivered to
Dresdner Bank. In fact, it would appear that no pledge in favor of Bank Century

‘was even executed.

 

' Section 6.2. of AMA. C 47.
143

464, The Claimant thus deprived Bank Century -- and by extension the LPS -- of the
US$ 203.4 million entrusted to him, or his entity, in order to improve the Bank’s
finances and liquidity position. In other words, the Claimant retained these assets

for his own unjust enrichment.
2. Loss of value in fraudulent asset pledges and unreturned assets

465. The Respondent submits that, in addition to the AMA losses, Bank Century
suffered significant losses when the Claimant organised asset pledges in order to

secure collateral, but kept the assets for himself.

466. There were two such asset pledges that could be identified: the first occurred in
2004, Bank Century pledged US$ 70 million of US Treasury Strips (maturing in
2011) and US$ 42.48 million in Republic of Indonesia bonds, to FGAH". The
pledge documents provided that the pledged securities would guarantee up to
US$ 100 million in loans. Ultimately FGAH secured only US$ 35 million in

loans with these pledged securities.

467. In 2005, Bank Century arranged to sell the entirety of the Republic of Indonesia
bonds portfolio to FGAH. The sale price was US$ 42.48 million, the face value
of the bonds,

468. Upon sale, Bank Century instructed FGAH to take US$ 35 million of the sale
proceeds and pay off the loan for which the bonds had stood as pledged security.
Bank Century told FGAH to invest the remaining US$ 7.48 million in new US
Treasury Strips. FGAH paid off the US$ 35 million loan, but Bank Century never
saw the remaining US$ 7.48 million again. Now that the US$ 35 million loan
had been paid off, the US$ 70 million in US Treasury Strips were likewise free
from a security pledge. Bank Century arranged to swap some US$ 12 million of
the Strips for Indonesian Rupiah in a deal with Kuo Capital. US$ 45 million of
the Strips were deposited in an account in Dresdner Bank in Zurich, reportedly

45 RB 49-51.

on behalf of Bank Century (the same bank that would later hold the security for
the AMA).

469. The Respondent claims that the remaining US$ 13 million of the US Treasury
Strips suffered the same fate as the US$ 7.48 million from the sale of the
Republic of Indonesia bonds: Bank Century never saw them again. As for the
US$ 45 million in Dresdner Bank: when Bank Century sought to recoup these
funds, Dresdner Bank informed it that US$ 30 million had been pledged as
security for a private loan to FGAH, which is the Claimant's own Bahamas
Company.

470. The Claimant and his witness, Mr. Rizvi, have insisted that Bank Century was
aware of this private loan, but the Claimant has provided no documentation to

support his assertion. Nor has he ever offered to repay the loan.

471. The Respondent alleges that, as a result of this asset pledge scheme, the
Claimant, presumably with Mr. Rizvi, enriched himself in the amount of US$
55.48 million (US$ 7.48 million + US$ 13 million + US$ 30 million), at Bank

Century’s expense.

472. The Respondent further alleges that, the second asset pledge scheme is more
straightforward. In 2005, the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi offered the possibility of a
US$ 40 million loan from ABN AMRO Dubai. As intended security for that
Joan, Bank Century initially provided to the Claimant a National Australia Bank
CD valued at US$ 30 million, Nomura Bank International CD valued at US$ 10
million, and a West LB CD valued at US$ 10 million. A few months later Bank
Century provided an additional National Australia Bank CD valued at US$ 15
million, intended as further security for the loan facility. The total value of the

pledged assets was thus US$ 65 million!*4,

473. The Respondent submits that no loan facility was ever arranged for Bank

Century, and the Claimant never returned for Bank Century, and the Claimant

44 Exhibit RB 64,
145

B.

@

474.

never returned Bank Century’s assets. (It appears that instead, the Claimant
arranged a loan to himself, or to one of his companies, using at least some of

Bank Century's assets as collateral.

The Respondent submits, therefore, the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi unjustly
enriched themselves in the amount of at least US$ 323.88 million (US$ 203.4
million+ US$ 55.48 million + US$ 65 million). As the ultimate party responsible

for rescuing Bank Century, Indonesia would now like that money back.

The Claimant

ANS,

The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s counterclaim must fail, for the

following reason:

The OIC Agreement grants no right of recourse to the state; the right only belongs
to the investor

476.

477.

2

478.

The Claimant submits that the Tribunal in the present case does not have
jurisdiction to decide on the Respondent’s counterclaim because the state does
not accrue any rights under the OIC Agreement. Any right to recourse arising
from the agreement belongs to the investor. Because the OIC Agreement does
not provide for a state’s right to a cause of action against an investor, the

Respondent’s counterclaim must fail,

Under UNCITRAL Rule 21.3, “the respondent may make a counterclaim or rely
on a claim for the purpose of set-off provided that the tribunal has jurisdiction
over it.145

The Claimant further submits that Article 16 of the OIC Agreement provides that
the “host state undertakes to allow the investor the right... to camplain against
a measure adopted by its authorities against him.” Article 16 also provides that

“if the investor chooses to raise the complaint before the national courts or

 

M5 CLA207 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010, art. 21.3.

146

479,

480.

before a tribunal then having done so. . . he loses the right of recourse to the
other.” The only rights of recourse that can be found in the language of the OIC
Agreement belong to “the investor,” as the investor is the beneficiary of the
obligations imposed on the state.

The Respondent's suggestion that Article 17(2)(d) of the OIC Agreement grants
it the right to assert a counterclaim has no merit. Article 17(2)(d) has nothing to
do with counterclaims. Instead, it is an enforcement mechanism providing that
decisions of an arbitral tribunal concerning a dispute under the OIC Agreement

“have the force of judicial decisions.”

Article 17(2)(d) further provides that “contracting parties must implement [the
decisions] in their territory,” regardless of whether the “investor against whom
the decision was passed” is a national of the implementing state. According to
the Respondent, the fact that a decision may be “against the investor” entitles
the state to assert a counterclaim. A decision is “against the investor” if the
investor does not prevail in its own claim — it does not give the state the right to

assert a counterclaim,

(ii) The Respondent’s counterclaim is outside the scope of the Claimant’s consent to
arbitration

481.

482.

The Respondent’s assertion that the Claimant consented to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction over the counterclaim lacks merit. The scope of the Claimant’s
consent to arbitration was limited to the scope of jurisdiction provided by the

OIC Agreement, which does not include state counterclaims,

The OIC Agreement is a binding offer of jurisdiction by the host state, which
must be accepted by the investor in writing.376 The Claimant accepted the
Respondent’s offer of jurisdiction by requesting arbitration and filing a
Statement of Claim, The terms of his acceptance are governed by the language
of the OIC Agreement. As already discussed, the OIC Agreement grants rights
to “the investor,” not the state. As a result, the Claimant’s acceptance of the
Respondent’s offer enabled the Claimant to enforce his rights as an investor, as
provided by the scope of jurisdiction in the OIC Agreement. As the Respondent

147

483.

does not accrue the right to a counterclaim under the OIC Agreement, any
argument that the Claimant consented to jurisdiction over a counterclaim must

fail.

The Respondent also claims that the Claimant consented to jurisdiction over the
counterclaim by way of a “Letter of Agreement” dated 25 November 2011146.
The Claimant submits that this argument has no merit. The letter of agreement
states that if the Tribunal rules in favour of the Claimant locus standi to bring
the claim, then the “merits and any counterclaim” will be heard by the same
Tribunal. As the claiming party in respect of the counterclaim, it falls to the
Respondent to prove every element of that counterclaim, including the legal
basis for it. The Claimant’s consent to such a counterclaim being brought before
the Tribunal does nothing to alleviate the responsibility of the Respondent. The
letter of agreement does not create additional substantive rights that are absent
in the OIC Agreement". If the Respondent cannot show a right to bring a
counterclaim by reference to the text of the OIC Agreement, it has failed at the
first hurdle.

Giii) The Respondent has already raised the complaint before the national courts and is
therefore precluded from seeking relief through arbitration

484,

The Claimant submits that the OIC Agreement does not impose any obligations
on the investor, nor does it create an avenue for the Respondent to seek relief for
alleged breaches of Indonesian law by the investor. Therefore, the Tribunal does
not have jurisdiction to decide on the merits of the Respondent’s counterclaim.
Alternatively, if the Tribunal does find that the language of the OIC Agreement
gives vise to jurisdiction over the counterclaim, it should still decline to exercise
jurisdiction, because the Respondent has already sought relief in the national

courts.

 

'46 The Respondent’s Defence and Counterclaiin {] 295

‘47 The Respondent refers to Exhibit CLA212 (pending claim asserted by Peru for breach of two
concession contracts entered into with investor Caravel{ Cotaruse); Exhibit CLA210 (finding jurisdiction
for the state’s counterclaim where the BIT’s dispute resolution clause contained broad language that
referred to resolving disputes under both inunicipal and international law).

148

485.

486.

Article 16 of the OIC Agreement states that, “Provided that if the investor
chooses to raise the complaint before the national courts or before an arbitral
tribunal then having done so before one of the two quarters he loses the right to
the other.” As mentioned in the section above, this language applies to rights of
the investors to bring claims, and those riglits do not accrue to the Respondent

under the agreement.

Even if the Tribunal finds that such rights do in fact accrue to the host state, the
Respondent is still precluded from bringing its counterclaim by Article 16 and
the doctrine of ne bis in idem. Article 16 applies the doctrine of ne bis in idem,
which means “not twice for the same.”™® It prevents prosecution twice for the
same cause of action. The Respondent has already raised the cause of action
against the Claimant in the national courts. Therefore, it is precluded from

raising it a second time in arbitration.

(iv) | The findings of the Indonesian court have no effect on the findings of the Tribunal

487.

488.

The Claimant submits that there are no rights in the OIC Agreement that accrue
to the state against the investor. As a result, the Tribunal does not have
jurisdiction over the Respondent’s counterclaim. Nevertheless, the Respondent
now wishes to take the judgment of an Indonesian court and apply it to the
present proceedings such that it would have a res judicata effect of establishing

a violation of a bilateral investment treaty. International law prohibits this.

“There is no effect of res judicata from the decision of a municipal court so for
as international jurisdiction is concerned.” The characterization of an act as
internationally wrongful is governed by international law. The fact that such an.
act was characterized as wrongful under domestic law has no effect on its

characterization under international law'®*. As a result, the Respondent may not

489,

apply the result of a decision rendered under domestic law to an international

arbitration proceeding applying the terms of a BIT.

The Claimant submits that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the
Respondent’s counterclaim because the OIC Agreement does not grant the state
the right to a cause of action against the investor. Even if the Tribunal does find
that the OIC Agreement grants the Respondent the right to assert a counterclaim,
it should still decline jurisdiction under Article 16 and the doctrine of ne bis in
idem because the Respondent has already raised its claim in the national courts,
Alternatively, if the Tribunal does not decline jurisdiction over the counterclaim,
then it should find that the judginent of the Indonesian court has no effect on the

Tribunal’s decision as to whether there has been a violation of international law.

(v) No evidence that losses claimed were incurred as a result of the Claimant’s actions

490.

491,

 

The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s understanding of the financial
transactions is woeful and, it would appear, the Respondent fails to grasp the
fundamental contradictions in its case against the Claimant and Mr Rizvi. On the
one hand, it accuses the Claimant and Mr Rizvi of “replacing valuable assets for
trash” — specifically “marketable securities” for “illiquid, ‘zero coupon’ CDs”.
On the other hand, it claims that the Claimant and Mr Rizvi used these so-called
“worthless junk securities” as collateral for substantial loans from major
financial institutions. It is on the basis of these misconceptions that the

Respondent bases its ill-fated counterclaim.

The Claimant claims that the Respondent does not appear to have carried out
even the most basic of due diligence. Had it done so, for example, it would have
discovered that Delta Advisory Pty is not related to the Claimant or Mr Rizvi
and any claims in respect of that entity must immediately fall away. The
Respondent claims that “/t/he Brattle Group Report confirms that the frauds of

Messrs, Al Warrag and Rizvi alone were the cause of the liquidity crisis that

forced Bank Century’s bailout”! yet there is nothing in the Brattle Report to

‘5! The Respondent’s Defence and Counterclaim.

150

demonstrate how this conclusion was arrived at. Indeed, nowhere is it suggested
that Mr Tantular’s misdeeds have been the subject of any meaningful analysis.
Instead, the Respondent has sought out the very perpetrator of these frauds and
invited him to tell his “story” which the Respondent has then advanced as the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The Claimant submits that, im
reality, each and every one of the allegations that form the basis of the Brattle
Group’s Report and the Respondent’s counterclaim is flawed. Mr. Rizvi deals
with the true nature and effect of the securities transactions and the source of

Bank Century’s liquidity problems in his Second Witness Statement.

VI. THE DECISION.-

492, On 21 June 2012, the Tribunal rendered its Partial Award, and decided as

follows:

“1, Article 17 of the OIC Agreement establishes investor-State dispute
resolution provisions between the Contracting Parties and investors of

other Contracting Parties;

2, In accordance with the above paragraph, the Respondent has
consented to arbitrate the dispute with the Claimant arising from the
Claimant’s avowed investment in Bank Century and as described in the

Notice for Arbitration;

3. The Tribunal reserves the determination of its jurisdiction to the
merits phase of the arbitration, where the questions to be determined
include whether the Claimant can establish its status as an ‘investor’

within the meaning of the OIC Agreement;

4. The applications for security for costs by the Respondent is
dismissed;

151

5. The costs of the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration are reserved

Jor the merits phase of the arbitration. ”

493. In the following sections, the Tribunal will discuss the issues that are decisive to

the outcome of the arbitration:

1)

2)

3)

4)

5)

6)

Does the Claimant qualify as an investor within the meaning of Article 1
of the OIC Agreement?

Did the Respondent breach Article 10 of the OIC Agreement?;

Ts there an obligation on the Respondent to provide fair and equitable
treatment, and if so, has that obligation been breached by the Respondent?;

Did the Respondent fail to provide adequate protection and security to the
Claimant’s investment, and therefore breached Article 2 of the OIC

Agreement?;

What is the effect, if any, of Article 9 of the OIC Agreement, on the rights

of the Parties in the arbitration; and

Does the OIC Agreement authorize the Respondent to submit a
counterclaim and, if so, how should the Respondent’s counterclaim be

determimed?

J. PRELIMINARY ISSUES

494. At the Final Hearing, the Claimant presented its objections to the Tribunal’s

495.

decision to have the Claimant testify via video-conference. The Parties had the

opportunity to make extensive submissions on the subject.

The Tribunal notes that there is no requirement that the claimant or the

respondent appear in person under the UNICTRAL Arbitration Rules or in

international arbitration in general, The Claimant was represented by counsel

and had the opportunity to provide his testimony by video-conference, and has

152

496.

put in statements, his witnesses have put in statements. The Claimant also had
the opportunity to present its case through its testimony as well as written

submissions.

The Tribunal therefore upholds its decision to bear the Claimant’s testimony via
video-conference during the Final Hearing, and confirms that the Parties have
had the opportunity to present their case in accordance with the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules.

2. ‘THE CLAIMANT’S STATUS AS INVESTOR WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 1

OF THE OLC AGREEMENT

497, In its Partial Award of 21 June 2012, the Tribunal reserved the determination of

498.

oe

499,

500.

whether the Claimant can establish its status as an ‘investor’ within the meaning
of the OLC Agreement to the merits phase. The Tribunal will discuss and decide
in this section whether the Claimant has standing as investor pursuant to Article
1 of the OIC Agreement,

Article 31 of the VCLT provides that a “freaty shall be interpreted in good faith
in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty

in their context and in the light of its object and purpose”.

The OIC Agreement Article 1(4) defines capital as “/a/il assets... owned by a
contracting party to this Agreement or by iis nationals, whether a natural person
or corporate body and present in the territories of another contracting party
whether these were transferred to or earned in it, and whether these be
moveable, immoveable, in cash, in kind, tangible as well as anything pertaining
to these capitals or investments by way of rights or claims and shall include net
profits accruing from such assets and the undivided shares and intangible

rights”.

Also, Article 1(5) defines investment as the “employment of capital in one of the

permissible fields in the territories of a contracting party with a view to

153

501.

502.

503.

achieving a profitable return, or the transfer of capital to a contracting party for

the same purpose, in accordance with this Agreement”.

Regarding the Claimant’s status as an investor in the present arbitration, the
Tribunal refers to the nationality requirements for an ‘investor’ as set out in

Article 1(6) of the OIC Agreement which defines the investor as:

“[T]he Gavernment of any contracting party or natural corporate person
[sic], who is a national of a contracting party and who owns the capital
and invests it in the territory of another contracting party.

Nationality shall be determined as follows.
(a) Natural Persons:

Any individual enjoying the nationality of a contracting party according

to the provisions of the nationality law in force therein.

(b) Legal Personality:
Any entity established in accordance with the laws in force in any
contracting party and recognized by the law under which its legal

personality is established.”

The Claimant argues that the definition of investor in Article 1(6) of the OIC
Agreement applies to him since he is a Saudi citizen, and Saudi Arabia signed

the OIC Agreement on 23 September 1983 and ratified it on 17 September 1984.

The Tribunal notes that there is no explicit reference to direct or indirect
investments in the OIC Agreement, and in particular in Article 1(4) and 1(5).
Article 1(5) requires the ‘employment’ of capital in the territory of a contracting
party (here Indonesia) without designating that the employment must be in the
investor’s own name. Similarly, Article 1(4), which defines capital, requires the
assets (here the shares in Bank Century) to be ‘owned’ by a national of a
contracting state (here, allegedly the Claimant, a national of Saudi Arabia) but
does not require the shares to be owned personally or directly, leaving open the

possibility of ownership through an investment vehicle such as FGAH.

154

504. The Respondent has called into question whether the Claimant personally held
shares in Bank Century at the time it was placed in administration. The Claimant
has referred to evidence that the Respondent treated the Claimant as a

shareholder at the time.

505. In fact, the Claimant alleges that its investinent was made through FGAH as well
as by the Claimant personally. FGAH is a company registered in the Bahamas.
The Bahamas are not a Contracting Party to the OIC Agreement, and so FGAH
is not an investor for the purposes of the OIC Agreement, However, the Claimant
also claims that he has demonstrated that he “owns the capital” in Bank Century
through his 100 per cent legal ownership of FGAH, as well as his ownership of
shares through his personal shareholding through ABN Amro, Also the Claimant
acquired and held directly 141,538,462 shares in Bank Century'**.

506. Concerning the Claimant’s direct ownership of “capital” in Bank Century,
according to a letter dated 13 June 2013 from the Financial Services Authority

Otoritas Jasa K which admini the Ind ia Stock Exck on

 

which Bank Century's (now Bank Mutiara's) shares are listed, as at 21 November
2008, the date of the bailout, not a single share was registered in the name of the

Claimant.

507, Furthermore, the List of Shareholders of Bank Century as of November 2008
(Exhibit R. 25) listed “Clearstream Banking SA Luxembourg” to hold shares in
the care of Citibank, NA., Jakarta. ABN Amro’s name was not mentioned. The
Claimant claims that his shares were held on his behalf by ABN AMRO. But
ABN AMRO does not appear on the Bank Century share register, except as the
custodian of a far smaller number of shares on behalf of someone else entirely
whose namie is recorded on the register (401 Budhi Somjtino). The Claimant also
claimed that his shares were held by a Luxembourg company, Clearstream.
However, there is no evidence of the Claimant’s interest in any shares held by

Clearstream.

 

‘8 C41, ABN AMRO statement dated 4 January 2009, and the Witness Statement of Hesham al-Warraq,
para, 22.

155

508. Even if for the sake of argument the Tribunal would accept the Claimant’s claim
that his shares were held by Clearstream, Indonesia does not recognize “bearer
shares”. Even “nominee” or “trustee” arrangements are not permissible under
Indonesian law. Shares in any Indonesian company must be issued (and
registered) in the name of their owner. Only the registered holder is recognized
as the owner. Even “nominee” or “trustee” arrangements are not permissible

under Indonesian law.

509, Article 48 of the Indonesian Company Law, Law No. 40 of 2007 (replacing Law
No. 1 of 1995}153 states as follows:

“Article 48

(1) Companies’ shares shall be issued under the name of their owner.

(2) The requirements for ownership of shares may be determined in the articles
of association with due attention to the requirements determined by the authorised

agency in accordance with the provisions of legislative regulations,

(3) In the event that requirements for ownership of shares as contemplated in
paragraph (2) have been determined and are not fulfilled, then the party who
obtained ownership of the shares may not exercise rights as shareholder and the
shares shall not be counted in any quorum which must be achieved in accordance

with the provisions of this Act and/or the articles of association.”

510. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant did not have a direct

investment in Bank Century.

511. However, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant’s ownership of shares in
Bank Century does not have to be direct in order for the Claimant to own the

capital within the meaning of investor in Article 1(6). The Claimant’s indirect

153 Exhibit RHA 23.
156

ownership of shares in Bank Century through FGAH satisfies the ‘investor’

requirement in the OIC Agreement.

512. Article 1(5) defines investment as the “employment of capital”. In the present
case, the employment of capital took the form of the acquisition of shares, As it
has been demonstrated during the proceedings, starting from early 2000, FGAH,
began to acquire shares in the Pre-merger banks (which merged to form Bank
Century), specifically three banks, CIC, Pikko, Danpac. FGAH’s total
shareholding in CIC was approximately 19.8%. FGAH also acquired 65% of
Pikko, and FGAH deposited USD 12,000,000 which was converted into shares
in Pikko in 2001. FGAH also acquired a 55% shareholding in Danpac in or
around the fourth quarter of 2001.

513, The Claimant acquired shares in FGAH in March 2001, being 11,970,000 shares
or 40% of the company. In 2004, the Claimant became the sole legal owner and
registered shareholder of FGAH, having full control of the management of
FGAH. Furthermore, FGAH acquired shares in the three Pre-Merger Banks that
came to constitute Bank Century, ultimately holding 2.707 billion shares in Bank
Century.

514. The Respondent has argued throughout the proceedings that investment treaties
must explicitly include indirect investments in their definitions, or else the
protection of investments is confined to direct investments. However,

contemporary arbitral jurisprudence adopts a broader definition of

I. For i in the case Sie y. Argentina, the JCSID

«

 

Tribunal observed that “‘here is no explicit reference to direct or indirect
investment as such in the [German/Argentine BIT]. The definition of
‘investment’ is very broad, An investment is any kind of asset considered to be
under the law of the Contracting Party where the investment has been made. The

du droit international 276 (1999) (excerpts).

157

 

specific categories of ii included in the definition are included as
examples rather than with the purpose of excluding those not listed. The drafters
were careful to use the words ‘not exclusively’ before listing the categories of
particularly’ included investments. One of the categories consists of ‘shares,
rights of participation in companies and other type of participation in
companies’. The plain meaning of this provision is that shares held by a German
shareholder are protected under the Treaty, The Treaty does not require that
there be no interposed companies between the investment and the ultimate owner
of the company. Therefore a literal reading of the Treaty does not support the

allegation that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments”,

515. Similar decisions were adopted on the same ground by several ICSID tribunals.
This was the case in Joannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia’®6, which interpreted
the BIT between Greece and Georgia, This was also the case in 7za Yap Shum
y. Peru, which interpreted the BIT between Peru and China!*’. This was finally
the case in Afobil v. Venezuela, interpreting the BIT between the Netherlands and

Venezuela'’,

516. Moreover several contemporary commentators have confirmed that the
definitions given to “capital” and “investment” in modern international
investment treaties refer broadly — as is the case with Article 1 of the OIC
Agreement -- to “all assets”. As explained by Andrew Newcombe and Luis
Paradell in their Commentary “Chapter 1 - Historical Development of
Investment Treaty Law”, “[w]ith small variations, similar definitions bringing
into the scope of treaties almost all possible forms of investment are found in
most ITAs. These definitions cover direct, as well as indirect, investments and

modern contractual and other transactions having economic value”.

517.For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant is an investor in Bank
Century within the meaning of the OIC Agreement by reason of his indirect
shareholding in Bank Century through FGAH.

3. THE MEANING OF “BASIC RIGHTS” UNDER ARTICLE 10 OF THE OIC
AGREEMENT / INVESTMENT GUARANTEES

518. Article 10 of the OIC Agreement provides:

“1, The host state shall undertake not to adopt or permit the adoption
of any measure ~ itself or through one of its organs, institutions or local
authorities — if such a measure may directly or indirectly affect the
ownership of the investor’s capital or investment by depriving him {fotally
or partially of his ownership or of all or part of his basic rights or the
exercise of his authority on the ownership, possession or utilization of his
capital, or of his actual control over the investment, its management,
making use out of it, enjoying ils utilities, the realization of its benefits or

guaranteeing its development and growth,

2. It will, however, be permissible to:-

(aq) Expropriate the investment in in the public interest in accordance
with the law, without discrimination and on prompt payment of adequate
and effective compensation te the investor in accordance with the laws of
the host state regulating such compensation, provided that the investor
shall have the right to contest the measure of expropriation in the

competent court of the host state.

(b) Adopt preventive measures issued in accordance with an order from a
competent legal authority and the execution measures of the decision given

by a competent judicial authority.”

519. The Claimant argues that the phrase ‘basic rights’ in Article 10(1) means

‘fundamental rights’ and “includes the Claimant’s human and civil and political

159

520.

521.

522.

rights codified in international law. These include the basic right to a fair trial,
as enumerated in Article 14 of the ICCPR” (Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief,
paragraph 119). The Claimant argues that this interpretation is supported by the
principle of systematic integration of international law norms articulated in
Article 31.3(c) of the VCLT as well as the ordinary meaning of the terms in
Article 101).

The Tribunal approaches the interpretation of ‘basic rights’ in accordance with
the general rule of interpretation in Article 31.1 VCLT. The object and purposes
of the OIC Agreement, as determined in paragraph 73 of the Partial Award, is
invesiment promotion and protection by conferring a broad range of rights on

investors.

Nevertheless, when Article 10(1) is considered as a whole it refers to measures
affecting the ownership or the exercise of ownership rights over an investment.
The Claimant’s interpretation considers the term ‘basic rights’ on a stand-alone
basis, whereas in Article 10(1) ‘basic rights’ appears as part of an extended
phrase relating to the ownership, possession, use, control, management and
realization of benefits of capital: The ‘basic rights’ referred to in Article 10(1)
are “basic rights...on the ownership, possession or utilization of [the investor's]
capiial”’, In short, properly interpreted in its context ‘basic rights’ refers to “basic
property rights’ and is not a general reference to civil and political rights such as
the right to a fair trial pursuant to Article 14 of the ICCPR relied upon by the

Claimant.

For these reasons, the Claimant’s submission that his right to a fair trial is
guaranteed by Article 10(1) of the OIC Agreement is rejected, However, for the
reasons set out later in this Final Award, the Tribunal will deal with the
contention that the Claimant’s rights guaranteed by the ICCPR form an element
of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment by the Respondent under Article
14(2) of the ICCPR to which Convention Indonesia is an acceding party.

CLAIMANT’S EXPROPRIATION CLAIM

$23.

524,

525.

It is undisputed that Bank Century, like other banks in Indonesia, had suffered
the consequences of the 2008 global credit crisis!**, Indonesian banks were
holding on to their liquid assets, which threatened to paralyze particularly small
and medium sized enterprises that needed credit. Depositors were beginning to
withdraw funds from some banks, including Bank Century, after its liquidity
problem had become known when it requested short-terin liquidity support from
Bank Indonesia’. As explained in the Second Audit Report of BPK of
December 2011, to overcome its liquidity issue, Bank Century received on 14,
17 and 18 November 2008 Short-Term Credit Facility loans from Bank

Indonesia in a total sum of Rp 683.39 billion’.

The Tribunal refers back to the circumstances of the bailout and does not
consider the bailout as expropriation, as the Claimant has not been deprived
“totally or partially ar his ownership” of the shares in Bank Century nor of “his
basic rights in the exercise of his ownership” of the shares, nor of his ‘actual
control’ over the shares within the meaning of Article 10(1). As it has been
demonstrated during the proceedings, Indonesian regulators did not take his
shares; they did not seize the bank. The Claimant’s holdings remain exactly as
they were before the bailout: some 2.7 billion shares, valued at least at 50 Rupiah
per share162, The Claimant was not deprived of his shareholding. Funds were
injected into the bank and a new class of shares was issued. The original, now
class B, shares were valued at that time at Rp, 78 per share, whereas the new,

class A, shares were issued at the value of Rp. 0.01 per share.

Further, Bank Century had, since 2005, been enrolled in the Deposit Insurance
scheme and had agreed, as was required of all banks joining the programme that
if they needed to be bailed out, the amount injected would be recognized as
equity in favour of the LPS. The Claimant consented by signing a statement
(Undertakings provided by Shareholders and Management of Century to LPS)

559 ‘This has been admitted by both Parties in their submissions (for example the Claimant’s Statement of

on behalf of FGAH, agreeing ". . . to discharge and submit to LPS any right,
management, and/or any other interest if the bank [Bank Century] becomes a
failed Bank”.!®3 As such, the Claimant cannot now object to the bailout or
otherwise claim that it constituted any kind of taking against his will, including

any expropriation.

The value of Bank Century at the time of the bailout was negative, and thus the
shares likewise were of no value, It is the view of the Tribunal that the bailout
was within the discretion and authority of the government and was completely
justified, particularly since Bank Century at a ratio below 10% at the time of the
bailout, could have caused a systemic risk to the entire Indonesian financial
system. Bank Century represented the 0.73% of the banking deposits and 0.68%

of the commercial banks actives.

Notwithstanding, under the investment guarantee in Article 10(1) and as is
provided by Article 10(2)(b), Indonesia is authorized to take ‘preventive
measures’ by order of a ‘competent legal authority’, Bank of Indonesia had a
responsibility to protect its depositors and took preventive measures in respect
of the banking crisis. On 13 October 2008, the Government, as a preventive
measure to rescue the ailing banks, issued Perpu No. 2 of 2008, authorising Bank
Indonesia to approve short term loans to ailing banks under less rigid
circumstances. As an implementation of the Perpu, Bank Indonesia on 30
October 2008, issued Bank Indonesia Regulation (PBI) No. 10/26/PBI/2008
which introduced the mechanism for granting short-term loans. On 14 November
2008, further amendments were applied to this instrument through PBI No.
10/30/PBY/2008, providing a further reduction in the requirements for obtaining

the short-term loans.

The Claimant claims that the bailout was unlawful because, infer alia, it was
unauthorized pursuant to a government regulation in lieu of law that was
subsequently rejected by the Indonesian Parliament. The Tribunal is of the view
that the bailout has factual and legal foundations, The decision was made

pursuant to Perpu No. 4 of 2008 and Law No. 24 of 2004, by the persons who

162

had the legal authority to make such decisions and take such action, and is valid
under Indonesian law. In this regard, the Tribunal refers to the expert opinion of

Dr. Isbrat Husain:

“To summarize, I have examined the events between 2005 and 2008 and
the letter from Governor Boediono to the Minister of Finance as the
Chairman of the Committee of Financial System Stability dated November
20, 2008 along with ‘Analysis of Failed Bank’ that resulted in the action
by Government of Indonesia against BC. I am of the view that the action
taken was justifiable, appropriate and bonafide and should have been
taken to avert the likely possibility of a systemic breakdown of the
Jndonesian Banking system. It would be worth recalling that the
Indonesian Banking system had a systemic collapse in 1998 when the
closure of 16 banks by President Soeharto had immediately led to the
failure of 52 other banks because of runs by their depositors. Given this
background, the market nervousness and the spillover effects of the Global
Financial crisis the action taken by the Gavernment of Indonesia can in
no sense, be construed as regulatory failings or lack of enforcement or
lack of monitoring of the BC. In my opinion, BI’s actions as a regulator
and supervisor of Bank Century were appropriate and satisfactory under
the given circumstances,”

529. The nature of a Perpu was explained by the Respondent’s legal expert Mr. Fred
Tumpbuan. In very special circumstances, the Government of Indonesia, which is
always represented by the President, bas the power to enact a government
regulation in lieu of legislation which has full powers and will act as a law until
the next session of Parliament. Parliament would then have to decide whether to
ratify or to reject the government regulations. If the Parliament ratifies it, like in
the case with the bankruptcy law, for example of 1998, then it becomes a law.

A Perpu will be effective unless subsequently revoked or repealed.

530. The bailout in the present case was legal because it was based on an existing,

operative legislative product which had the form of a Perpu. The fact that it was

‘Exhibit R 28, Expert Report of Dr. Ishrat Husain, at paragraph 53.
163

531.

a measure issued in accordance with an order from the competent legal authority,
which in this case was the Financial Sector Stability Committee (the KSSK), and
which represents the Indonesian State in its administrative and regulatory
activities, to prevent the possibility of a systemic meltdown of the banking
system, makes it a permissible measure under Article 10(2)(b) of the OIC
Agreement. If the Parliament did not subsequently ratify the Perpu, it would not
invalidate it or the actions taken under it. ‘The bailout was legal and permissible

as a matter of Indonesian law.

In the present case and, as confirmed by the Respondent’s witness Mr Halim
Alamsyah, based on ithe mandate given by Perpu No. 4 of 2008, the Committee
of the KSSK assessed the matter and decided on 21 November 2008 that Bank
Century should be rescued by the LPS.

. Furthermore, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent did not follow the proper

procedure since there is no evidence that the Claimant consented to the bailout
and that he was given an opportunity to inject funds into Bank Century at the
time of the bailout to preserve his percentage ownership in Bank Century.
However, the Tribunal is of the view that the measures taken by Bank Indonesia
were in accordance with Law No. 24 of 2004 on Deposit Insurance Agency.
Under this law, the LPS, has the power and mandate to‘rescue a failed bank
which is deemed to have systematic effect for the purpose of safeguarding the
depositor’s fund and to maintain the stability of the Indonesian banking system.
In accordance with Article 9(4) of the law:

“As a member of the Deposit Insurance as stipulated in Article 8, each
bank is obliged to:
a. Submit the following doctiments:
{J
4) statement from the commissioners, the directors and the bank's
shareholders, that contains:
i. i and willii from the i ‘s, the
directors and the bank’s shareholders to comply with all

conditions as stipulated in the IDIC Regulations;

164

ii. willingness to take personal responsibility for any
negligence and/or unlawful act that results in a loss or
endangering the continuity of the bank's operations; and

iii, willingness to release and surrender to the IDIC all
entitlements, proprietorship, management, and/or
interests should the bank become a Failing Bank and is

decided to be rescued or liquidated;”

533. In the case of Bank Century, five letters of commitment were signed. At least
three of them were signed by the Claimant himself, which is evidence that the
Claimant was aware of his obligations regarding Bank Century. As explained by
Mr. Tumuban, these Letters of Commitment are legally binding, in accordance

with Law No. 24 mentioned above.

534. In addition to the above, the Claimant had signed the Undertakings provided by
Shareholders and Management of Century to LPS. Specifically, Bank Century
had, since 2005, been enrolled in the Deposit Insurance scheme and had agreed,
as was required of all banks joining the programme that, if they needed to be
bailed out, the amount injected would be recognized as equity in favor of the
LPS.

535. Moreover, as explained by Dr Husain in his testimony, the atmosphere of fear
and uncertainty in late 2008 meant that no bank (even one liolding 0.73% of the
total deposits in Indonesia) was too small to fail, There was an urgency for the
LPS to act swiftly to assuage the fears of the general public and prevent bank
runs. Depositors were already uneasy about the prospects of the financial
economy and had withdrawn significant sums of deposits from Bank Century
after the short term funding facility was granted to Bank Century on 14 and 15
November 2008,'%

165 ‘Yyanscript of 13 March 2014, p. 34 line 10 to p. 35 line 6.
165

536. Accordingly, the Tribunal is of the view that the LPS was entitled to proceed to
bail out Bank Century without the involvement of the shareholders and had
complied with the procedures in the IDIC Law in the conduct of the bailout.

537. With respect to the Claimant’s negligence claims!, the Claimant claims that it
was reasonable for him to expect Bank Indonesia to carry out its supervisory
duties effectively. The Claimant claims that these expectations were in part
based on representations that Bank Indonesia itself made as to its regulatory
regime. The Claimant also claims that Bank Indonesia has a wide range of
powers at its disposal in order to achieve its aim as regulator and supervisor of
banks, but that Bank Indonesia negligently or wilfully failed to avail itself of
those powers. The Claimant alleges that the Respondent’s negligent failure to
properly supervise Bank Century and Mr Tantular’s consequent fraud on the
bank amounts to an unlawful expropriation, which had the effect of destroying

the Claimant’s investment.

538. However, the Tribunal considers that Bank Indonesia exercised sufficient
diligence in its supervisory functions and rejects the allegations of negligence by
the Claimant. The Tribunal refers to the testimony of the Respondent’s expert
Dr Husain who stated that: “{t/he threshold for negligence is much higher than
the greater laxity or what I call as a weakness of the supervision. In this case, I
would admit that the central bank was weak in its supervision in the sense that
it should not have allowed this intensive supervision to extend for three and a
half years. But from all the material which I have reviewed and seen, I do not
think that the threshold of negligence has been crossed or has been reached, The
reason is that the internal controls, the operational controls of risk management,
of compliance, of audit, of legal supervision, have not been followed by either
the management or the board of directors or board of commissioners. In many
cases, the appravals have been given by the board of commissioners who
represent the shareholders. So this cannot be attributed to the negligence of the
central bank. It is impossible for the central bank to micromanage every single
bank. It doesn't have the resources to do so, So 1 would say, yes, very humbly I

would submit that there was a weakness as far as supervision was concerned.

539.

But there was no negligence as far as my own threshold level of negligence is

concerned,”'

The Claimant seeks in relation to the expropriation claim damages to compensate
him for the alleged loss of his investment in the sum of USD 9,671,060,
However, the Tribunal concludes that the bailout in the present case was a
permissible preventive measure under Article 10(2)(b) of the OIC Agreement.
Article 10(2)(b) expressly makes it permissible for a state to “adopf preventive
measures issued in accordance with an order from a competent legal authority”.
Consequently, the Claimant’s claim for damages in the sum of USD 9,671,060

is dismissed.

5. ‘THE CLAIMANT’S FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT CLAIM

(i) Article 8 and the Most Favoured Nation Standard

540.

541.

542.

 

There is no fair and equitable treatment guarantee in the OIC Agreement.
However, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent is subject to a fair and
equitable treatment obligation by virtue of the most-favoured-nation clause in
Atticle 8 of the OIC Agreement.

The Tribunal notes that the most-favoured-nation clause has been applied to
matters of dispute-settlement as well as substantive treaty guarantees. This issue
has been dealt with by a number of contemporary arbitral decisions, which also
recognized the application of most-favoured-nation clauses to import fair and

equitable treatment.

In Pope & Talbot Ine, v. Canada (2001, 2002)'*, the tribunal relied on the most-
favoured-nation clause contained in NAFTA Article 1103 in order to underpin
its argument that the fair and equitable treatment standard of NAFTA Article
1105 could not be considered as providing for less protection than other free-

standing fair and equitable treatment clauses.

 

°<7Transcript, 13 March, page 52: line 19 - page 54: line 8.
68 Pope & Talbot Inc, v. Government of Canada (Tribunal Decision ~ 10 April 2001).

167

543. Also in MTD v. Chile!®, the most-favoured-nation clause was combined with
the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment in the same provision of the
applicable BIT between Chile and Malaysia. It was the tribunal’s view that this
clause allowed for the invocation of substantive obligations contained in other
BITs concluded by Chile and Denmark and Croatia, namely the obligation to
award permits subsequent to approval of an investment and to fulfilment of

contractual obligations.

544. There are two views regarding the application of MEN clauses. The first view is
that the MF'N clause would only operate to the extent that a provision in another
treaty is compatible in principle with the scheme negotiated by the parties in the
basic treaty and departs from it only in a detail consistent with the broader
scheme. The other view adopts a literal interpretation that would extend the
operation of the MEN clause to all areas of other treaties, regardless of any
comparison or judgment or compatibility. However, even under this view, the
ejusdem generis rule would still apply. The two treaties would still have to deal
with the same subject matter, as is the case with the protection of investments

treaties.

545. The OIC Agreement does not include a FET provision. However, Article 8 of
the OIC Agreement contains a most favoured nation clause that provides as

follows:

“t}he Investors of any contracting party shall enjoy, within the context of
economic activity in which they have employed their investments in the
territories of another contracting party, a treatment not less favourable
than the treatment accorded to investors belonging to another State not
party to this Agreement, in the context of that activity and in respect of

rights and privileges accorded to those investors”.

546. Specifically, Article 8 provides that the “treatment” must be in the “context of

economic activity in which [the investors] have employed their investments in

‘MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile, \CSYD Case No. ARB/OL/7, Award (25 May 2004).

547,

the territories of another contracting party” and “in the context of that activity

and in respect of rights and privileges accorded to those investors.”

The Claimant secks to rely on Article 8 of the OIC Agreement to incorporate the
obligation in Article 3 of the UK-Indonesia BIT which came into force on 24
March 1977, and which provides:

“Promotion and protection of investment

Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions
Sor nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to invest capital
in its territory and, subject to its right to exercise powers conferred by its
laws, shall admit such capital.

Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall
at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shail enjoy full
protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.
Each Contracting Party shall ensure that the management, maintenance,
use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of nationals or
companies of the other Contracting Party is not in any way impaired by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures. Each Contracting Party shall
observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments
of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.” (emphasis
added)

548. The preamble of the OIC Agreement reads as follows:

“PREAMBLE

The Government of the Member States of the Organisation of the Islamic

Conference signatory to this Agreement,

In keeping with the objectives of the Organisation of the Islamic

Conference as stipulated in its Charter,

169

In implementation of the provisions of the Agreement for Economic,
Technical and Commercial Cooperation among the Member States of the
Organisation of the Islamic Conference and particularly the provisions of

Article 1 of the said Agreement,

Endeavouring to avail of the economic resources and potentialities
available therein and to mobilize and utilize them in the best possible

manner, within the framework of close cooperation among Member States,

Convinced that relations among the Islamic States in the field of
investment are one af the major areas of economic cooperation among
these states through which economic and social development therein can

be fostered on the basis of common interest and mutual benefit,

Anxious to provide and develop a favourable climate for investments, in
which the economic resources of the Islamic countries could circulate
between them so that optimum utilization could be made of these resources
in a way that will serve their development and raise the standard of living

of their peoples,
Have approved this Agreement,

And have agreed to consider the provisions contained therein as the
minimum in dealing with the capitals and investments coming in from the

Member States,

And have declared their complete readiness to put the Agreement into
effect, in letter and in spirit, and of their sincere wish to extend every effort

towards realizing its aims and objectives.”

549. The preamble of the OIC Agreement refers to the anxiety of the signatories to
develop ‘a favourable climate for investment’. The OIC Agreement contains
typical investment protection provisions, including guarantees of adequate

protection and security, incentives, freedom of movement of personnel, most-

170

550.

551,

552.

553.

favoured-nation protection, protection against expropriation, free transfer and
disposition of capital, compensation for the violation of rights, and national
treatment. The object and purpose of the OIC Agreement is investment,

promotion and protection by conferring a broad range of rights on investors.

The preamble of the UK-Indonesia BIT refers to the signatories’ desire to create
favourable conditions for greater econoinic cooperation between them, and in
particular for investinent of nationals and companies of one State in the territory
of the other State. It also recognizes that the encouragement and reciprocal
protection under international agreement of such investments will be conducted
to the stimulation of individual business initiative and will increase property in

both states.

‘The Tribunal is of the view that the MFN clause applies to import other clauses
as long as the ejusdem generis rule applies. In the present arbitration, the
Tribunal notes from the above preamble that the subject matter of the OIC
Agreement as well as the UK-Indonesia BIT relied upon by the Claimant to
import fair and equitable treatment, is the same, which is the protection of the

foreign investment.

The Respondent has argued that there is a limitation in Article 8, and that the
MPN treatment only applies within the context of the same economic activity,
and that in this respect Article 8 is different from a typical MFN clause found in
BITs that do not contain such a limitation. The Tribunal does not view the
reference to “same economic activity” as imposing a limitation on the scope of
application of the MFN clause relevant in this case. The investment of the
Claimant was employed in the banking sector, and this is the area of economic
activity for the purposes of Article 8. There is nothing in the UK-Indonesia BIT
that excludes or restricts the banking sector from the scope of protection granted

to investments of the other State.

The Respondent has also argued during the proceedings that the Claimant may
not import provisions from the UK-Indonesia BIT because his investment was

not “granted admission” in accordance with BKPMP-administered admissions

171

554.

process. However, The Tribunal agrees with the conclusion reached by the
tribunal in Rafat Ali Rizvi v. Republic of Indonesia'® that the BKPM-
administered process is not a requirement for the admission of foreign
investments in the banking sector and that investments under the UK-Indonesia
BIT are not required to have gone through a BKPM administered admission
process in order to gain the protection of the treaty!”". The tribunal in that case
found that: “the BKPM regime and the regulatory regime governing the banking
sector are separate and distinct. Howeyer, neither the BIT nor the FCIL indicate
that all foreign investment in Indonesia is subject to the BKPM regime. On the
contrary, foreign investment in certain sectors is not subject to BKPM
procedures. The Tribunal notes in particular that FCIL Article 5, was part of the
FCIL when the BIT was concluded. That provision makes it clear that Indonesia
had the flexibility to decide what sectors would foreign investment be allowed
and under what conditions. Article 5 does not specify that those conditions of
admission could only be found within the FCIL itself; The reference to the
banking sector in the negative list of the amended FCIL confirms the conclusion
that the FCIL itself is broad enough to address the banking sector without also
requiring investments in that sector to abtain admission through the BKPM.

Were this not so, banking would not be included in parts of the negative list”.

Moreover, the UK-Indonesia BIT is not the only BIT in which the Respondent
has agreed to accord fair and equitable treatment to foreign investments. The
Claimant has referred to similar fair and equitable treatment standards in several
other BITs to which Indonesia is a party. Such examples include, the
Netherlands-Indonesia BIT, which provides that the Respondent shall “ensure
fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of [the Netherlands]
and shall not impair, by unreasonably or discriminatory measures, the
operation, i ce, use, enjoy or dist I thereof by
those nationals.”'” This BIT does not specifically limit the scope of the treaty
to those investments “granted admission in accordance with the Foreign

Investment Law.” Additionally, the Singapore-Indonesia BIT provides that

"Rafat Ali Rizvi v. Republic of Indonesia (CSID Case No. ARB/11/13)

i)

“investors shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment,"\? while
mentioning nothing about a mandatory admissions process. The India-Indonesia
BIT also provides that “investments and returns of investors of each Contracting
Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment in the territory

of the other Contracting Party?"

555. Based on the above, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant is entitled to

fair and equitable treatment protection through the OIC Agreement’s MFN

clause.

The Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard and the ICCPR

556.

557.

558.

 

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent has exceeded its prosecutorial and
investigative powers and therefore denied the Claimant of fair and equitable
treatment. In particular, the Claimant alleges that his treatment by the
Respondent breached the ICCPR. In this section the Tribunal will discuss the

ICCPR and its relevance to the Claimant’s FET claim.

The ICCPR is an integral part of the UN’s “International Bill of Rights”, which
includes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948, the ICCPR 1966 and
its two Optional Protocols, as well as the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights: ICESCR 1966.

The ICCPR is now regarded as “a part of general international law”! it
constitutes an extension of the rule first established by the Permanent Court of
International Justice in 1925 that “rights under international law could be

conferred on individuals.”!7®

The most signally important feature of the ICCPR is that it is a universal
instrument which contains binding legal obligations for the States patties to it.
The rights enshrined within it represent the basic minimum set of civil and
political rights recognized by the world community, Moreover, whatever the
disagreement over the nature of the human rights obligations in the United
Nations Charter and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there is no
doubt that the obligations in Article 2 of the ICCPR to respect and ensure the
rights in the ICCPR are legally binding!”

When a State becomes a party to the ICCPR by ratification of the Covenant it
enters into a set of relationships with the individuals within its jurisdiction, and
with other State parties. Every State party binds itself to a series of obligations
atising from the provisions of the ICCPR (Article II), Underlying all these
obligations is the overriding principle of good faith, a principle first recognised
in the Charter of the UN 1945 Article 2(2): “All members in order to ensure to
all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership shall fulfil in good
faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter”,!78
and reiterated in the Declaration on Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among
States in accordance with the Charter of the UN of 1970: [UN Gen. Ass.
Resolution No. 2625 (XXV)~ “The state shall fulfil in good faith the obligations
assumed by them in accordance with the Charter”]. Good faith is now a principle
of customary international law. Under Article II a State-party assumes the
obligation to respect and to ensure the protection of human rights without any
discrimination within its jurisdiction, As a consequence, the State Party
undertakes to refrain from doing anything injurious to Auman rights and do
everything to ensure respect for human rights of the individual person
concerned. It is the failure to honour this obligation that amounts to a violation
of the principle of good faith. And the role of Civil Society — a role reflected

and replicated in decisions of international arbitral tribunals — is to keep

'77 So stated in “The Human Rights Committee, Its Role in the Development of the International Covenant

on Civil and Political Rights” by Dominie McGoldrick ~ Clarendon Paperbacks (1994).

8 The principle of good faith is now a principle of customary International Law and that the drafters
thought it desirable to state the principle more explicitly. See para 31 page 243, of Vol, X (2012 — Oxford
University Press) of The Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law. Editor Rediger Wolfrun.

reminding the State party to adhere to the principle of good faith, and if and

when the State has failed to do so, to so declare in its arbitral award.

561,

When ratifying a treaty the State undertakes to honour its obligations!” under
that treaty. This means in the present context its obligations to comply infer alia
with the provisions of Article 14(3)(d) in all aspects. When it does not do so, it
is the duty of the competent Court or Tribunal to so declare: even though there
is no recourse to be had to the implementing agency - the Human Rights

Commission - with respect to remedies.

562. The Tribunal notes that, on 23 February 2006, Indonesia acceded to the 1966
ICCPR.

563. Article 14(3) of the ICCPR provides that:

“In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall

be entitled to the following minimum guarantees, in full equality:

(a) To be informed promptly and in detail in a language which he

understands of the nature and cause of the charge against him,

(6) To have adequate tine and facilities for the preparation of his defence

and to communicate with counsel of his own choosing;
(c) To be tried without undue delay;

(@) To be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through
legal assistance of his own choosing; to be informed, if he does not have
legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance assigned to him,
in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment

by hint in any such case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it;

Page 1226 to 1229: page 1234 para 609 Vol.2 Oppenheim’s International Law 9" Edition, Longman
(1992), (Annexed as Annexure-Il),

175

564,

565,

566.

567.

(e) To examine, or have examined, the witnesses against him and to obtain
the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same

conditions as witnesses against him;

f) To have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or

speak the language used in court;

(g) Not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt”.

From the foregoing paragraphs it is clear that under Article 14(3)(d) of the
ICCPR all persons charged with a criminal offence have a primary, unrestricted
right to be present at the trial and to defend themselves. However, this right (and
other requirements of due process enshrined in Article 14) cannot be construed.
as invariably rendcring proceedings in absentia inadmissible irrespective of the
reasons for the accused person’s absence, there must be some exceptional reason

for holding the trial in absentia even where the address of the assumed is known.

Proceedings in absentia are not prohibited under Article 14(3)(d) only when the
accused person, although informed of the proceedings sufficiently in advance,
voluntarily declines to exercise his right to be present. In such circumstances
proceedings in absenfia are permissible in the interest of the proper

administration of justice.

Where a person has been duly summoned, has received summons well in time
to attend the trial but has chosen not to appear (there being no impediment to his
not appearing - such as for instance a Red Corner Notice dated 9 June 2009 as in
the case of the Claimant) then it would be perinissible, even in the light of Article
14(3)(d) to try the accused in absentia, and it would not be a breach of that

Article where the accused chooses not to appear.

A judgment in absentia in order to be valid requires that, notwithstanding the
absence of the accused, all due notification has been made to inform him of the
date and place of his trial and to request his attendance — otherwise the accused.

will not have been given adequate time and facilities for preparation of his

defence (Article 14(3)(b)), will not have been able to defend himself through
legal assistance of his own choosing (Article 14(3)(d)) nor, would he have the
opportunity to examine or to have had examined witnesses against him and to
obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on bis behalf (Article

143).

Where a person has been tried and convicted in absentia, it must be shown that
the accused was summoned in a timely manner and was informed of the
proceedings against him — and this camot be presumed or assumed. It is
incumbent on the Court that tried the case to verify that the accused had been
informed of the pending case and the proceeding to hold the trial in absentia
because failing such evidence the right of the accused to be tried in his presence

is violated,

Where a summons has been stated to be served but no indication is given of any
steps actually taken by the State-party in order to transmit the summons to the
accused person, and whose address is known to the judicial authority, it will be
taken that there is violation of the provisions of Article 14(3)(d): this is because
“when exceptionally, for justified reasons, trials in absentia are held strict

observance of the rights of defence is all the more necessary”.
(a) Presumption of innocence

Regarding the Claimant’s right to be presumed innocent, the Claimant claims
that, by making adverse public comments about the Claimant, the Respondent
failed to respect his right to be presumed innocent, and has therefore acted in

violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.

The presumption of innocence is one of the most established fundamental rights
of individuals recognized by customary international law. Article 14(2) of the
ICCPR provides that “everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the

right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.

177

572. The UN Human Rights Committee, the body that supervises compliance with
the ICCPR, made that clear in its General Comment 13 of 1984!®:

“No guilt can be presumed until the charge has been proved beyond
reasonable doubt. Further, the presumption of innocence implies a right
to be treated in accordance with this principle. It is, therefore, a duty for

all public authorities to refrain from prejudging the outcome of a trial”.

573. The right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty is a principle that
conditions the treatment to which an accused person is subjected throughout the
period of criminal investigations and trial proceedings, up to and including the

end of the final appeal.

574, Various international human rights bodies consider that the presumption of
innocence is violated whenever public authorities or representatives of
government make public statements, which prejudge the outcoine of particular
criminal proceedings. As the Inter-American Court of Human Rights

(“IACHR”) stated!*!;

“The right to presumption of innocence ,.. requires that the State should
not convict an individual informally or emit an opinion in public that
contributes to forming public opinion, while the criminal responsibility of
that individual has not been proved. ”!”

575. The European Court of Human Rights (“ECHR”), applying Article 6(2) of the
European Convention on Human Rights!*, also held that statements made by a
minister of interior holding up a suspect as an instigator of a murder constituted
a violation of the right to the presumption of innocence!’*, The ECHR has also

held it to be a violation for a speaker of parliament to make statements amounting

‘The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, states in its Article 11 that:

“lelveryone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed
7 190

innocent until proved guilty according to law
As stated by the Human Rights Commitice, this duty to refrain from prejudging
a trial applies to all public officials, including and especially public prosecutors
and other law enforcement authorities!" The need for strong, independent and
impartial prosecutorial authorities for the effective maintenance of the rule of
law and human tights standards cannot be sufficiently emphasized. According

The Claimant claims that, in the present case, the Claimant’s right to be
presuined innocent was compromised by the conduct and publicly expressed
views of Indonesian public officials, specifically the declaration of Deputy
Attorney General Marwan Effendy at the Jakarta Globe on 8 January 2010:
“twle have learned that Hesham alone took Rp 3 trillion, We're ready [to go to
court] but we still need official lass estimates from state auditors and the money
laundering charge provided by the police,” ... “Once they finish their job, the

case is ready for trial. We hope it will happen this month. !

The Claimant refers to another public declaration was done through the Jakarta
Globe on 21 January 2010, whereby the Deputy Attorney General Marwan
Effendy, in reference to the Claimant and Mr Rizvi, stated that: “[t]heir case will
be handed to the Central Jakarta Prosecutor’s Office because we have
concluded the investigation,” ... “Hesham and Rafat have inflicted state losses
of Rp 3.115 trillion [8336 million].’"4

In this regard, the Tribunal is of the view that, although the above-mentioned
statements were unwise, they state that the Claimant has inflicted losses, but do
not state that he is guilty of a crime. To the contrary, they presume his right to a
trial.

(b) The Respondent's conduct of the criminal investigation of the Claimant

Regarding the investigation of the Claimant, it appears from the evidence that
the Claimant was never examined by the Police or AGO in Indonesia. The
Respondent did not take reasonable steps to ensure that the Claimant was
informed in a timely manner of the criminal investigation that was being
conducted against him. The Respondent was well aware of the presence of the
Claimant in Saudi Arabia, and yet it failed to seek the assistance of the authorities
in Saudi Arabia to interrogate the Claimant or even allow investigators of the

Respondent to go to Riyadh to hear him and take a statement from him.

180

582. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Article 18(3) of UNTOC and Article 46(3)

of UNCAC provide:

“Mutual legal assistance to be afforded in accordance with this article
may be requested for any of the following purposes:

(a) Taking evidence or statements from persons;

(b) Effeeting service of judicial documents,

(c) Executing searches and seizures, and freezing;

(@) Examining objects and sites;

(e) Providing information, evidentiary items and expert evaluations;

(f) Providing originals or certified copies of relevant documents and
records, including government, bank, financial, corporate or business
records;

(g) Identifying or tracing proceeds of crime, property, instrumentalities
or other things for evidentiary purposes;

(h) Facilitating the voluntary appearance of persons in the requesting
State Party,

(i) Any other type of assistance that is not contrary to the domestic law of

the requested State Party”. (emphasis added).

583, Both the UNTOC Article 18(3)(a) and UNCAC Article 46(3)(a) establish that

584,

mutual assistance be afforded under the convention and may be requested for the
purpose of “/t/aking of evidence or statements from persons”. Despite the fact
that, under both UNTOC and UNCAC the Respondent could have requested the

assistance of the Saudi authorities, it failed to do so.

The Claimant has also the right to be properly examined in accordance with
Articles $0(1) and 52 of KUHAP. As explained by Ms. Desy Meutia herself in her
affidavit “(flor the purposes of its investigations of criminal offfences, the AGO
may issue summonses to suspects and witnesses requiring them to attend the AGO
to be questioned in relation toe particular offences. The examination is a
mandatory part of the criminal procedure process. Upon completion of the
investigation, the case is transferred to the Public Proescutor at the Distrivt

Attorney’s Office (the “Prosecutor”), who may issue an indictment and summons

181

for a defendant to attend trial”. Thus, the Respondent breached the Claimant’s
rights under Articles 50(1) and 52 KUHAP to be examined as a suspect and to
freely give information during the examination, by failing to hear him or take any

statements from him during the investigation phase.
(c) The service of court summonses

585, Moreover, under Articles 145, 146 and 227 KUHAP, the procedure for service

of court summonses on overseas defendants is as follows;

(1) An attempt to personally serve the person summoned at his place of
residence, or most recent place of residence in Indonesia, at least 3 days

before the date of the hearing. (Art 227(3) read with Art 227(1)-(2) KUHAP)

(2) If the person is not present at his place of residence in Indonesia but is
overseas, the summons must be conveyed through a representative of
Indonesia (typically the Indonesian embassy) at his place of residence or
most recent place of residence, (Art 227(3) read with Art 145 KUHAP). This
service need not be personal. (see Transcript of 12 March 2014 p. 24 lines
14-16 and Transcript of 18 March 2014, p. 137 lines 24-25). There is no
presumption that service is valid, whether or not the embassy forwards the

summons onto the defendant, unless proven otherwise.

(3) If the person summonsed is not at his overseas place of residence, the
summons must be put on the office noticeboard of the official who issued
the summons, ie., the public prosecutor, (Art 227(3) read with Art 146
KUHAP)

(4) There is no prohibition against service by newspaper advertisement, but this

must be in addition to the methods mentioned in KUHAP!,

 

 

195 {See Justice Harahap’s repeated comments that service on the notice board is perfected by service via
newspaper at Transcript of 18 March 2014, p. 110 line 19 to p, 112 fine 1 and p. 128 le 24 to p. 130 line
8).

182

(5) The summons must (i) include the date, day and time of the hearing; (ii)
specify the case about which the defendant is summoned, including the
nature and cause of the charge against him, (iii) be in “a language which he
understands”, and (iv) be received no less than 3 days before the hearing
begins. (Arts 51(b) and 146(1) KUHAP; Arts 14(3) and (3)(a) ICCPR)

586. The Claimant was not properly served under these provisions of the KUHAP:-

(1) None of the court summonses was personally served on the Claimant at his
most recent place of residence in Indonesia, which is the first step in the
procedure for valid service’,

(2) Even if the aforesaid first step was satisfied, only one of the court

)'7 was served at the

summonses (7.¢., the summons dated 24 March 2010
Claimant’s most recent overseas place of residence (i.e. Kingdom Tower)
through the Indonesian embassy, and that summons did not properly specify

the case against the Claimant.

587,

~

Specifically, the summons did not state the provisions of the Anti-Corruption
Law for which the Claimant was being indicted, or give any details about the
allegedly improperly placed forex notes (e.g. the relevant dates, parties, notes).

Nor did it mention the money laundering charge.

588. Although in its Orders of 23 May 2010 and 4 June 2010, the Central Court of
Jakarta has by interlocutory judgment declared the summons to have been duly
served on the Claimant, the Tribunal is of the view that the evidence of Ms, Desy
Meutia Firdaus (including her cross-examination) clearly establish that there is
no proof of actual service of the Court’s summons to attend trial on the Claimant
himself. The Respondent failed to prove that the Claimant received the summons
well in time to attend the trial and chose not to appear. On the contrary, the

Claimant had said during his examination at the Final Hearing in answer to a

15 (See Desy Firdaus’ leslimony at Transcript of 18 March 2014, p. 82 lines 15-25).

'? Tab 355,

question as to why he did not attend trial in Indonesia: “because I was put on the
Red Notice and the Saudi Government said I could not leave or go anywhere”!*8,
Moreover, Article 88 (1) of INTERPOL’s Rules for the Processing of Data
provides that “Blue notices are published in order to: (a) obtain information on
a person of interest in a criminal investigation, and/or (b) locate a person of
interest in a criminal investigation, and/or (c) identify a person of interest in a
criminal investigation”, It is the Tribunal’s view that the Respondent also failed
to establish that it made any efforts to verify that the Claimant received any of
the summonses allegedly sent to the Claimant. The Tribunal agrees with the
Claimant that the Respondent should have asked INTERPOL to issue a Blue
Notice in order to locate the Claimant and establish with accuracy his residential
address, so the Claimant be properly and effectively served. The Respondent
did not attempt to serve the court summonses on the Claimant via letters
rogatory. The Respondent also failed to use the mechanisms reasonably
available to it (i.¢., its embassies in Singapore and Saudi Arabia, and a request
to Interpol to issue a Blue Notice) to verify which of the Claimant’s addresses
was his place of residence. The Tribunal finds that these failures amount to a
breach of the Claimant’s basic rights under Article 51(b) of the KUHAP and
Article 14(3)(a) of the ICCPR to be properly informed of the charge against him.

(d@) The Claimant's trial in absentia/right of review
589. Furthermore, Article 14, Section 3(b) of the ICCPR provides that:
“In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall
be entitled to the following minimum guarantees, in full equality .....(b) to
be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal

assistance of his own choosing”.

590. Article 16 (10) of the UNTOC provides:

198 Transcript of 12 March 2014 page 73.
184

“A State Party in whose territory an alleged affender is found, if it does
not extradite such person in respect of an offence to which this article
applies solely on the ground that he or she is one of its nationals, shall, at
the request of the State Party seeking extradition, be obliged to submit the
case without undue delay fo its competent authorities for the purpose of
prosecution. Those authorities shall take their decision and conduct their
proceedings in the same manner as in the case of any other offence of a
grave nature under the domestic law of that State Party, The State Parties
concerned shall cooperate with each other, in particular on procedural

and evidentiary aspects, to ensure the efficiency of such prosecution.”

591. Also Article 44(1) of the UNCAC provides:

“This Article shall apply to the offences established in accordance with
this Convention where the person who is the subject of the request for
extradition is present in the territory of the requested State Party, provided
that the offence for which the extradition is sought is punishable under the
domestic law of both the requesting State Party and the requested State
Party”.

592. According to the above, if the party requested declines to extradite then it has
the obligation to prosecute, The UNTOC and UNCAC does not give the option.
for a trial in absentia. This interpretation was reinforced by the ICJ in Belgium

v Senegal:

“LJ if the State in whose territory the suspect is present has received a
request for extradition in any of the cases envisaged in the provisions of
the Convention, it can relieve itself of its obligation te prosecute by
acceding to that request. It follows that the choice between extradition or
submission for prosecution, pursuant to the Convention, does not mean
that the two alternatives are to be given the same weight. Extradition is an

option offered to the State by the Convention, whereas prosecution is an

185

international obligation under the Convention, the violation of which is a
1199

wrongful act engaging the responsibility of the State

593. Moreover on 29 October 2009, the Respondent made the following request to

the government of Saudi Arabia“[s}hould the Government of Saudi Arabia is

unable to grant the request for extradition, the Government of the Republic of

Indonesia seeks the assistance of the Government of Saudi Arabia to carry out

investigations and prosecute Hesham Talaat Besheer Al Warraq under Article
16(10) UNTOC,”

594, The above request by the Respondent confirms that trial in absentia is not an
option under the UNCAC and UNTOC.

595. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that, for the extreme measure of trial in
absentia to be permissible under international law, the Respondent must provide

evidence that the Claimant:

1) was notified of the trial, i.e. proper service of process;

2) had unequivocally and explicitly waived his right to be present at trial;

3) had the legal right to be represented at trial and that he was actually

represented;

4) is able subsequently to obtain from a court which has heard him a fresh

determination of the merits of the charge.

596, The ICCPR Article 14(3)(d) states that every person shall be entitled “[t]o be
tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance
of his own choosing”. In the same vein, Article 54 of the KUHAP provides that,
for the purpose of his defence, an accused has the right to obtain legal assistance
from one of more legal counsel during the period of and at every stage of

examination, according to the procedures stipulated in the KUHAP.

ICT Reports 2012, 1 95.

186

597, Furthermore, under Indonesian law the Claimant was not allowed to be
represented by counsel in his absence. In this regard, the Tribunal refers to the
testimony tendered at the Final Hearing by the Respondent (in particular the
quoted extract of Dr Harahap”®’, by which it confirmed that under SEMA
6/1988, once a defendant in absentia has been summoned, he will not be allowed

to be represented by counsel appointed after the date of the summons.

Q. Okay. The next question, if a defendant is absent, can he appoint a

lawyer to represent him in the case while he is absent?

A. Initially, it is open to that. However, because of bitter experience of the
court, experience by the community and Indonesian people, when the
law on anti-corruption was promulgated in the year 1970, many people
who committed to corruption fled to outside of Indonesia and did not
want to appear before the court, But then he appointed a lawyer to
represent him. And such conduct constituted contempt of law. If the —
he is freed, then they would come to Indonesia and get applause. But if

he is punished, then he run away. It is very bitter.

At that time, I was a justice of the Supreme Court, it came to my mind
about how to overcome with this contempt of court. Then since then, a
so-called Supreme Court circulation number 6 of the year 1988, so from
since the year 1973 through to the year 1988, the society, Indonesian
people suffered from bitter harassment conducted by the corrupt
people,

Q. Because basically so the -- so are you saying that under Supreme Court
circular 6, 1988, an absent defendant cannot appoint a lawyer, are you

saying?

A, (In English) Yes.

The Respondent’s expert witness on Indonesian criminal law, Dr Harahap, who
testified on this point before the Tribunal explained the ratio legis of SEMA No.

6/1988 in a recent interview:

“Iwas a judge from 1982 to 2000, At the time, corruptors tended to flee.
Then their lawyers started to submit all kinds of appeals. The state courts
opened the possibility for attorneys to submit any legal appeal, whether
cassation or case reviews, but the accused was in absentia, had run away.

This is clearly making fun of the courts’?”!,

Dr. Harahap confirmed this in his Affidavit? as well as during cross-

examination at the Hearing.

The Tribunal concludes from the above that Indonesian law allows for the
extreme measure of trial in absentia in corruption cases but by virtue of SEMA
6/1988 persons accused of corruption that are tried in absentia are not allowed
to be represented by counsel. Indonesian law thus barred the Claimant from

appointing counsel to represent him during his trial in absentia.

. Furthermore, according to the evidence tendered by the Respondent through the

oral testimony of Dr. Harahap”®’, the right to appeal one’s conviction in absentia
is conditioned on the appellant appearing in person before the court in order to
appeal. Appeal through counsel i# absentia is thus not permitted. It must also be
noted that the amended SEMA 1/2012 excludes absent convicts from the right
to file a petition for judicial review. To file for judicial review, an absent convict
must go to Indonesia, which in the case of the Claimant was not possible, since
the Respondent issued a Red Notice against the Claimant, and therefore the latter
could not leave Saudi Arabia, not even to attend his own trial. The Tribunal is of
the view that such a condition is in contravention of Article 14, Section 5 of the

ICCPR.

605.

Further, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the Respondent’s authorities
allowed the appeals period to expire without ascertaining whether the Claimant
had actually received the judgment. This is in breach of Indonesian Law (Articles
67 and 233(1)-(2)), which provide for the Claimant’s right to file an appeal

within 7 days from the date he is made aware for the judgement.

Articles 67 and 233(1)-(2) KUHAP require any appeal to be filed by the
Claimant within 7 days from the time he is ‘made aware’ of the Jakarta Verdict.
The threshold for being made aware of a judgment is set out in Art 36(3) Anti-
Money Laundering Law. (Art 38(3) of the Law on Corruption sets a lower
threshold than the Anti-Money Laundering Law and therefore is not discussed
here.) Under Art 36(3), an in absentia decision must be (i) announced by the
public prosecutor on the notice board of the court that decided the case and (ii)
included in at least 2 newspapers with national circulation for at least 3 days or
in 3 consecutive publications. What the Respondent did was to advertise the
Jakarta Verdict in Media Indonesia twice (on 11-12 April 2011) and once in the
Jakarta Post (on 11 April 2011}. However, the Claimant did not dispute that the
Jakarta Verdict was announced by the public prosecutor on the notice board of
the deciding court. Hence, under the Anti-Money Laundering Law, the Claimant

was ‘made aware’ of the Jakarta Verdict by 12 April 2011,

The Respondent also breached the Claimant’s right under Article 14(5) ICCPR
to have his conviction reviewed by a higher tribunal. Art 14(5) ICCPR requires
the Claimant to be given access to the Jakarta Verdict in a manner that enables
him to effectively exercise his right of review in Art 14(5). Due to the Claimant’s
inability to travel to Indonesia, he could not attend the reading of the verdict or
consult the court noticeboard for notification of the verdict. Moreover, he could
not read Bahasa, which is the language of the newspaper Media Indonesia. In
these circumstances, the Respondent should have, but failed to, give the
Claimant access to a soft/hard copy of the Jakarta Verdict prior to the expiration

of the 7 days appeal period on 19 April 2011,

Also, this failure is attributable to the Respondent because customary
international law contains a long established procedure that would have enabled

the Respondent to establish without any doubt whether and when the Claimant

189

606.

607.

had received the judgment in order to start the period within which appeals were
allowed. That procedure is codified in Article 5(f} of the Vienna Convention on
Consular Relations (1963) (the “WCCR”), which states that one of the functions
of consular missions is to cooperate with the local authorities when the delivery
of judicial documents is necessary. Both Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are parties
to the VCCR. If this procedure had been followed, the authorities of Saudi
Arabia would have informed Indonesia if and when the judgment had actually
been served. The Respondent failed to demonstrate that it followed this
procedure, and it thus allowed the appeals period to expire without ascertaining
whether the Claimant was actually aware of the judgment containing his

conviction,

(e} The Claimant’s other claims in relation to the fair and equitable treatment

standard

The Claimant has also argued that the offences of corruption and money
laundering under Indonesian law cannot be categorised as such under recognised
principles of international law. Moreover, the Claimant asserts that the Jakarta
courts decision was not supported by the evidence before it, and that the Jakarta
court did not explain the basis on which the Claimant was held personally liable
for the acts allegedly carried out by FGAH and Mr. Rizvi, and moreover, at times
conflated the Claimant and FGAH. The Claimant also alleges that the Jakarta
Court discriminated against him in terms of his sentencing. However, the
Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not provided sufficient evidence to confirm

these allegations, which are therefore dismissed.

The Claimant failed to demonstrate how the offences of corruption and money
laundering under Indonesian law do not accord with internationally recognised
principles of criminal law. The Claimant’s reliance on Articles 15 and 21 of the
UNCAC is misplaced because these provisions do not set out the elements of
corruption and/or money laundering, but instead impose a general obligation on
State Parties to adopt legislation which criminalises the bribery of public
officials and bribery in the private sector. The Claimant’s argument that the

money laundering charge merely requires transfer or restructuring of assets is

190

also misconceived. The elements of Art 3(1)(g) Anti Money Laundering Law,

as set out in the Jakarta court’s decision, clearly require mens rea.

608. The Tribunal observes that the Jakarta Verdict does appear to conflate the
Claimant and FGAH in some instances. For example, some of the securities
transactions in issue for the corruption conviction were conducted between Bank
Century and FGAH. Moreover, the money laundering conviction relies on,
among other things, the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi having conducted transactious
involving commercial paper of Bank Century to a value of USD$116.08m
eventually placed with or controlled by FGAH .

609. However, the Jakarta Verdict’s conflation of the Claimant and FGAH is justified
on the basis of Article 20 of the Law on Corruption Eradication and Article 4 of
the Anti-Money Laundering Law:

a, Article 20(1) of the Law on Corruption Eradication states that “Jn the
event that the criminal act of corruption is committed by or on behalf of
a corporation, the lawsuit and the sentence can be instituted against
and imposed on the corporation er its board of directors” (emphasis
added).

b. Article 4(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering Law provides that “Jn the
event that the crime is committed by the managers ,.. on behalf of a
corporation, both the managers and/or the managers’ agents as well
as the corporation shall be subject to prosecution and imposition of
criminal sanctions” (emphasis added). Article 4(2) limits the managers”
criminal liability “to the extent that the managers concerned hold

a

functional positions in the corporation's ors L structure”

(emphasis added).

610. The Claimant is the sole shareholder and director of FGAH.?" Pursuant to
Article 20 of the Law on Corruption Eradication and Article 4(1)-(2) of the Anti-

Money Laundering Law, he can be prosecuted and punished for acts which he

24 Transcript of 12 March 2014, p. 81 lines 1-5.
191

611.

612.

25 C9.

committed on behalf of FGAH in his capacity as a member of the board of
directors of FGAH.

Regarding the corruption claims, the Claimant submits that the Respondent
failed to investigate or even engage with the Claimant’s and Mr Rizvi’s
complaints of bribe solicitations during the criminal mvestigation. The Claimant
and Mr Rizvi through their counsel Kingsley Napley wrote to Central Jakarta
District Court, dated 7 July 2010, 22 July 2010 and 22 October 2010, to inform
them about the irregular conduct and bribe solicitations made by the Attorney
General’s Office’. Regardless of whether the bribe solicitation allegations are
true, there is no evidence that the Respondent took or attempted to take the
necessary steps to investigate these allegations, However, the Tribunal is not
persuaded that such behaviour by the Respondent amounts to a violation of the
fair and equitable treatment standard, since there is no connection between the

corruption allegations and the Claimant’s alleged deprivation of its investment.

Moreover, the Claimant did not demonstrate that he had a right to have his
allegations of corruption investigated by State authorities. The Claimant, infer
alia, relied on Article 30(3) of the UNCAC. This article requires that States
“endeavour to ensure that any discretionary legal powers under its domestic law
relating to the prosecution of persons for offences established in accordance with
this Convention are exercised to maximize the effectiveness of law enforcement
measures in respect of those offences and with due regard to the need to deter
the commission of such offences” (emphasis added). The UN’s Legislative
Guide for the implementation of this Convention classifies Article 30(3) under
the beading of “non-mandatory requirements”, and further states in relation to
Article 30(3) that “these States must make an effort to encourage the application
of the Iaw to the maximum extent possible in order to deter the commission of
offences established in accordance with the Convention” (emphasis added),
Indonesia therefore has no obligation under Art 30(3) to investigate corruption

allegations.

192

615.

616.

The Tribunal further notes that, when the Special Task Force on Judicial
Corruption responded to the Claimant’s allegations of corruption and requested
him to provide further information, the Claimant did not respond with further

information.

The Tribunal is also not satisfied that the Respondent has (i) attempted to solicit
bribes from the Claimant on multiple occasions, (ii) initiated criminal
proceedings against the Claimant, not out of a genuine belief in his guilt, but in
order to access his funds abroad, (iii) breached the Claimant’s right to the status
quo ante and non-aggravation of the dispute by virtue of the initiation of asset
seizure proceedings against the Claimant’s funds abroad, the Red Notice, and its
involvement in getting the Saudi police to interrogate the Claimant. The

Claimant has failed to provide sufficient evidence of these allegations.

The Tribunal recognises that there is a general right to status quo ante and non-
aggravation of disputes in investment arbitration law. Based on past decisions of
tribunals, the threshold to be satisfied for the imposition of sanctions for a breach
of this right is extremely high: the conduct of the State must undermine the
integrity of the arbitral process; see Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to
Amend the Provisional Measures Order, paragraphs 14-42; Quiborax S.A., Non
Metallic Minerals S.A, and Allan Fosk Kaplin v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,
ICSID Case No, ARB/06/2 Decision on Provisional Measures, paragraphs 116-
124 and 134-148,

On the facts, the Tribunal finds that Indonesia’s actions did not undermine the
integrity of this arbitration. Indonesia’s initiation of asset seizure proceedings
against the Claimant, while resulting in the Clamant having to spend GBP
411,896.60 to date to defend himself, were not so disruptive in diverting the
Claimant’s resources away from this arbitration. The Claimant was still able to
raise sufficient funds to make the deposits required for this arbitration,
Moreover, the Red Notice against the Claimant also did not have the effect of
undermining the integrity of this arbitration. While the Claimant was prevented

from travelling overseas by reason of the Red Notice, he had many convenient

193

617.

s

618.

619.

means by which to give instructions to his counsel (e.g. by email, by telephone
call, by contacting the Saudi Arabia office of Vinson & Elkins). The Claimant
was also able, during the merits hearing, to testify via videoconference, hear the
proceedings through skype, and give instructions to his counsel through skype
and other means of communication. Furthermore, being called to the local police
station for questioning on three occasions since the commencement of this
arbitration (i.e. over a span of three years or so) does not qualify as harassment,
aud there is no indication on the evidence that the information gathered by the
Saudi authorities during the interrogations was supplied to Indonesia for use in

this arbitration.

Additionally, the Tribunal considers that, if the Claimant was of the view that
Indonesia’s actions breached the principle of status quo ante and non-
aggravation of the dispute, he should have raised his concerns at an earlier stage
of this arbitration in the form of an application for interim measures, rather than
waiting until after the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing to bring up his

concerns,

The Claimant has also argued that Bank Century’s placement under LPS
administration and the subsequent criminal conviction in absentia of the
Claimant and his business associate, Mr Rizvi, to imprisonment and the payment
of a huge amount of money, seriously impaired the management, maintenance,
use, enjoyment or disposal of the Claimant’s investment in the territory of
Indonesia. As discussed above in paragraphs 525-534, the bailout was a
preventive measure necessary and permitted under Article 10(2) of the OIC
Agreement. Although the Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s trial and criminal
conviction in absentia constitutes a denial of justice and therefore a breach of the
fair and equitable treatment standard, however, the Tribunal is not persuaded
that the Claimant’s criminal conviction in absentia deprived him of his
investment, since (as it was discussed above) Bank Century was at negative

value and in need of a bailout.

Furthermore, the Claimant claims that the Respondent’s alleged expropriation of

his investment, as well as the conduct of its police officers and judicial

194

authorities in investigating any wrongdoing in relation to Bank Century’s
collapse and bailout, are by their nature attributable to the Respondent. Inaction
by the banking regulator, Bank Indonesia, is also an act attributable to the
Respondent that can be at the origin of a breach of international law. Hence, the
frustration of the Claimant’ s legitimate expectations results from both regulation
by the Respondent (in the form of Perpu No. 4 of 2008 etc. etc.) and from the
Respondent’s negligent supervision of Bank Century in breach of its duties as
banking regulator, The Tribunal is of the view that a central bank’s primary duty
of care is to the depositors of a bank, not to portfolio investors who buy shares
of the bank, or of other financial institutions through intermediate corporate
entities on the stock market. Thus, the Claimant could not have legitimately

expected that the central bank owes him a duty in the circumstances,

620. The Tribunal points out that its role is not to correct procedural or substantive
errors that might have been committed by the local courts in Indonesia. As
explained by Jan Paulsson in his book Denial of Justice in Intemational Law’,
the international obligation on states is not to create a perfect system of justice
but a system of justice where serious errors are avoided or corrected. The
Tribunal also stresses that the threshold to establish a claim of denial of justice

is high.

621. Having said that, the Tribunal is of the view that denial of justice constitutes a
clear violation of the FET standard. Failure.to comply with the most basic
elements of justice when conducting a criminal proceeding against an investor
amounts to a breach of the investment treaty. The Tribunal concludes that in the
present case, the Claimant was not properly notified of the criminal charges
against him, he was tried and convicted in absentia and the sentence was not
properly notified to the Claimant. The Claimant was not able to appoint legal
counsel and was not able to appeal his sentence. The Tribunal concludes,
therefore, that the Claimant did not receive fair and equitable treatment as

enshrined in the ICCPR for the above reasons — and not for any other pleaded by

206 Denial of Justice in International Law. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005, By Jan
Paulsson,

the Claimant, Accordingly, the Claimant’s fair and equitable treatment claim is

upheld.

6. THE CLAIMANT’S PROTECTION AND SECURITY CLAIM UNDER ARTICLE 2 OF
THE OIC

622.

623.

624,

625.

626.

 

The Claimant argues that the obligation provided by Article 2 of the OIC
Agreement was also breached by failing to provide adequate protection and
security to his investment, and by the conduct of the prosecutorial authorities
and of the courts of law who applied the criminal legislation in an arbitrary and

discriminatory manner.

Article 2 of the OIC Agreement provides:

“The Contracting parties shall permit the transfer of capitals among them
and its utilization therein in the fields permitted for investment in
accordance with their laws, The invested capital shall enjoy adequate
protection and security and the host state shall give the necessary facilities

and incentives to the investors engaged in activities therein”.

The language of Article 2 is straightforward. It creates an obligation on the host
state to provide adequate protection and security to the invested capital of the

investor, i.e, the investment.

Moreover, the Respondent has an obligation to provide protection and security
that is adequate in the circumstances. The Tribunal is of the view that the host
state has an obligation to provide no more than a reasonable measure of
prevention, which a well administered government could be expected to exercise
in similar circumstances””,

In the present arbitration, Bank Century, along with other banks in Indonesia
was facing serious liquidity issues which prompted the Respondent to intervene.
The Claimant cannot argue that the investment was not provided the adequate

protection since as indicated above in paragraphs 525-534, the bailout in the

27 CLA 150 and RLA 33.

196

627.

628,

629,

present case was a permissible preventive measure under Article 10(2)(b) of the
OIC Agreement, Article 10(2)(b) expressly makes it permissible for a state to
“adopt preventive measures issued in accordance with an order from a

competent legal authority”.

‘The Claimant also argues that the Respondent failed to provide the investment
with adequate protection and security within the meaning of Article 2 of the OIC,
as a consequence of the Respondent’s negligence in supervising Bank Century.
The Tribunal refers to the paragraphs set out above including paragraphs 535
and 536 and holds that the Claimant has failed to provide evidence of the
Respondent’s negligence in its supervisory role. The Claimant also argues that
adequate protection and security is not only limited to protection against physical
violence, but also extends to legal protection. However, as explained above,
since the protection under Article 2 of the OIC Agreement only applies to the
“investment” and not the “investor”, it is generally not infringed by physical

threats (if proved) to the investor.

The Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent’s bailout of Bank Century falls
within the reasonable measures expected from a well administered government
in similar circumstances. The Tribunal concludes therefore that the Respondent
did not breach Article 2 of the OIC Agreement.

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent denied him adequate protection and
security by violating his due process rights. However, since adequate protection
and security is offered only to the investment, measures that affect an investor
personally with no concomitant effect on the investment do not amount to a
breach of that standard of protection. Indonesia’s violation of the Claimant’s due
process rights did not have any adverse impact on the Claimant’s investment as
the bailout had already been concluded by the time the Indonesian authorities
conducted their investigation and prosecuted the Claimant. Accordingly, the
violations of due process did not deny the Claimant’s investment adequate

protection and security.

197

630.

As a final point, the Tribunal notes that the standard of protection and security
required by Article 3 of the UK-Indonesia BIT (applicable by virtue of the MFN
clause in Article 8 of the OIC Agreement) is ‘fudl protection and security’. The
Tribunal considers that full protection and security is not a higher standard than
adequate protection and security. As the Tribunal has found there has been no
violation of the adequate protection and security standard, its follows that nor

has there been any violation of the full protection and security standard.

7, APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 9 OF THE OIC AGREEMENT

631.

632,

633.

634.

Unlike most BITs, the OIC Agreement contains an explicit provision that binds
an investor to observe certain norms of conduct. That restriction is found in

Article 9 which reads:

“The investor shall be bound by the laws and regulations in force in the
host state and shall refrain from all acts that may disturb public order or
morals or that may be prejudicial to the public interest. He is also to
refrain from exercising restrictive practices and from trying to achieve
gains through unlawful means.”
Article 9 prevents the investor from taking any actions that would disrupt the
public interest. Jt appears from the evidence provided by the Parties during the
present proceedings, that the systematic threat of the Claimant’s actions in the
Indonesian financial system have been prejudicial to the public interest. Article
9 also prevents the investor from “trying to achieve gains through unlawful

means”.

The Tribunal has heard the testimonies of highly qualified experts and heard
then critically analyze the actions of the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi in the

investment banking sector.

The Tribunal refers to the Brattle Report?°8, which identified six types of fraud

in which the Claimant was engaged. These are as follows:

208 R26.

198

635,

636.

637.

638.

Uneconomical Swap — with his own entity: According to the Report, in
December 2004, Bank Century handed over substantial cash and valuable assets
to Chinkara (now FGAH), an investinent company owned by the Claimant. In
exchange it received securities worth substantially less, The assets obtained by
Bank Century were worth roughly US$70 million less than the assets delivered.
Bank Indonesia identified these losses during its 2005 audit of Bank Century,

Use of Bank Century Assets to Obtain Private Loai: During 2004, Bank Century
pledged to Chinkara/FGAH existing securities with face value of US$157.48
million, The pledged securities would have commanded a market value of
around US$100 million at the time. The understanding was that Chinkara/FGAH
would then use the pledged assets as collateral to obtain credit facilities on behalf
of Bank Century. Rather than obtaining the full US$100 million facility,
however, the Claimant caused Chinkata/FGAH to obtain a loan of only US$35
million. The Claimant and Mr. Rizvi used at least part of the remainder of the

securities, as collateral for a loan for themselves.

Failure te Obtain Loans and Return Collateral: Bank Century pledged further
securities with US$65 million face value to FGAH during 2005 and 2006, on the
understanding that FGAH would use the assets as collateral to obtain credit
facilities on its behalf. FGAH, controlled by the Claimant, never obtained new
loan facilities. The Claimant did not return to Bank Century many of the
securities pledged to FGAH.

Failure to Honour the AMA; Following Bank Indonesia’s guidance at the end of
2005, Bank Century sought to sell over US $200 million of its “marketable”
securities. Bank Century signed the AMA with Telltop, one of their investment
vehicles. Under the AMA, Bank Century appointed Telltop to manage and sell
various securities and then to deliver back to Bank Century the cash proceeds
from any sale. Although FGAH/Telltop held vatious securities on behalf of Bank
Century under the AMA, and although Telltop warranted to Bank Century that
it would receive cash of at least face value by 2009 for these securities, it appears

that Bank Century received little or none of such proceeds.

Replacing Valuable Assets For Trash: The Report also states that, the Claimant
and Mr. Rizvi replaced on several occasions from 2005 onwards several of Bank
Century’s securities that would pay out cash in US dollars upon maturity, for
others that would pay out in shares of various funds managed by a company
called First Capital Management, also controlled by them. The Claimant and Mr.
Rizvi made the “Assets for Trash” switches on their own initiative and without
Bank Century’s approval. Bank Century has derived no value whatsoever from
shares in the funds managed by First Capital Management.

Failure to Pay Interest on Securities Held for Bank Century. Throughout the
period 2005 to 2008, and resulting from asset pledges and other transactions,
FGAH held various securities on behalf of Bank Century. Many of the securities
were interest-bearing. But according to the Report, the Claimant never passed

through the associated interest payments to Bank Century.

In addition to the above, the Claimant was the Vice President of the Board of
Commissioners in Bank Century. As a member of the Board of Commissioners
the Claimant had the obligation, among others, to supervise management
policies, the running of management in general, with regard to both the company

and the company’s business, and give advice to the Board of Directors.

. Article 108(2) of the Indonesian Company Law provides:

“Boards of Commissioners shall supervise management policies, the
running of management in general, with regard to both the Company and

the Company’s business, and give advice to the Board of Directors."

The Claimant admitted at the Final Hearing during his cross-examination”® that

he was not aware of his obligations as provided by Indonesian Company Law.

The Claimant’s admission that he undertook the duties on the Board of
Commissioners in a major bank without understanding their significance is

clearly prejudicial to the public interest prohibited by Article 9 which refer to

Transcript, 12 March, page 87: line 5 to page 89: line 25.

200

645,

647.

648.

the investor’s being “bound by the laws and regulations in force in the host

state”.

The Tribunal concludes from the above that the Claimant failed to uphold the
Indonesian laws and regulations. The Tribunal further considers that the
Claimant’s action, whether criminal or not, caused a liquidity issue to Bank
Century, and his actions have been prejudicial to the public interest, in this case
the Indonesian financial sector. The Claimant having breached the local laws and
put the public interest at risk, he has deprived himself of the protection afforded.
by the OIC Agreement.

In this regard, the Tribunal is of the view that the doctrine of “clean hands”
renders the Claimant’s claim inadmissible. As Professor James Crawford
observes, the “clean hands” principle has been invoked in the context of the
adinissibility of claims before international courts and tribunals, Also the
Tribunal refers to the decision of Lord Mansfield in Holman v Johnson (1775)

which states:

“No court will lend its aid ta. a man who founds his cause of action upon
an immoral or illegal act. If, from ihe plaintiff's awn stating or otherwise,
the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the transgression of
@ positive law of this country, there the court says he has no right to be

assisted”.

As mentioned above, it is established the Claimant has breached Article 9 of the
OIC Agreement by failing to uphold the Indonesian laws and regulations and in
acting in a manner prejudicial to the public interest. The Claimant’s actions were
also prejudicial to the public interest. The Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s
conduct falls within the scope of application of the “clean hands” doctrine, and

therefore cannot benefit from the protection afforded by the OIC Agreement.

The Tribunal concludes that, although it has been established that the Claimant
did not receive fair and equitable treatment, as set out in paragraphs 555 to 603
above however, by virtue of Article 9 of the OIC Agreement the Claimant is

prevented from pursuing his claim for fair and equitable treatment.

201

8. THE CLAIMANT’S CLAIM FOR DAMAGES

649,

650.

651.

Regarding the Claimant’s claim for damages, the Claimant argues that, pursuant
to Article 13 of the OIC Agreement, he is entitled to damages for the
Respondent’s violation of the Claimant’s rights under the ICCPR. The Claimant
claims for compensation in the sum of USD 5 million under Articles 13.1(a) and
13.1(d) for damages caused to the Claimant by the Respondent’s violation of the
Claimant’s “basic rights” under Article 10.1 and its violation of the laws in force
in Indonesia, including the Claimant’s costs and expenses incurred in connection
with his defence of the asset seizure and other ancillary proceedings relating to

the Respondent’s pursuit of his assets which are assessed at GBP 702,874.00.

The Claimant also claims for moral damages in the sum of USD 5 million to
compensate the Claimant for the physical and psychological harm he has
suffered as a result of the Respondent’s egregious conduct towards him in breach

of Articles 10.1 and 13, including injury to business reputation.

Article 13 of the OJC Agreement reads as follows:

d, The investor shall be entitled to compensation for any damage
resulting from any action of a contracting party or one of its public or
local authorities or its institutions in the following cases:-

a. Violation of any or the rights or guarantees accorded to the
investor under this Agreement:

6. Breach of any of the international obligations or undertakings
imposed on the contracting party and arising under the Agreement for
the benefit of the investor or the non-performance of whatever is
necessary for its execution whether the same iy intentional or due to
negligence:

G Non-execution of a judicial decision requiring enforcement
directly connected with the investment;

a Causing, by other means or by an act or omission, damage to the
investor in violation of laws in force in the state where the investment
exists.

202

652.

2, The compensation shall be equivalent to the damage suffered by
the investor depending on the type of damage and its quantum.

3. The compensation shall be monetary if it is not possible to restore
the investment to its state before the damage was sustained.

 

4. The of monetary ion shall be luded

within 6 (six) months from the date when the damage was sustained and
shall be paid within a year from the date of agreement upon the amount
of compensation or from the date when the assessment of the
compensation has become final.”

The application of Article 13 is subject to Article 9. As explained above,
although the Tribunal has established that the Claimant did not receive fair and
equitable treatment, (as set out in paragraphs 555 to 603 above) the Tribunal also
finds that pursuant to Article 9 of the O1C Agreement the Claimant is prevented
from pursuing his claim for fair and equitable treatment. Thus, the Claimant

cannot request for compensation under Article 13 of the OIC Agreement.

. Furthermore, the Tribunal finds that moral damages are generally awarded only

if illegal action was motivated or maliciously induced (see for instance Jnmaris
y. Ukraine ICSID Case No: ARB/08/8 - Award of 1.3.2012 para 428; see also
in a later award the Rompetrol Group v. Romania \CSID Case No: ARB/06/3 ~-
Award dated 6.5.2013:

“The Claimant asserts in its Post-Hearing submissions that “moral
damages cover non-pecuniary injury for which monetary value cannot be
mathematically assessed and ...must be determined by the tribunal with a
certain amount of discretion.” This would conform to the approach taken
by the only two ICSID tribunals that have hitherto awarded moral
damages. A leading commentary draws as its conclusion from the cases
that tribunals seem to enjoy “an almost absolute discretion in the matter
of determining the amount of moral damages.” The very fact, however,
that this alternative claim for damages is both notional and widely
discretionary prompts a considerable degree of caution on the part of the
present Tribunal in facing the proposition that compensable ‘moral’

damage can be suffered by a corporate investor.

203

The case law in the investment field, as indicated, is very thin: two
tribunals have accepted claims for moral damage and two have declined
to award it. In general international law, while the award of moral
damages is certainly accepted, both practice and the published literature
show that this represents either damage to the honour and dignity of a
State — in which case the remedies are non - economic — or else indirect
conpensation under the rubric of diplomatic protection for injuries of a
personal kind suffered by the citizens of the claimant State. In the opinion
of the Tribunal, neither of these categories fits the present case. The
Tribunal has already indicated that reputational damage to a protected
foreign investor is a perfectly conceivable consequence of unlawful
conduct by the State of the investment, and if so is likely to show itself, for
example, in increased financing costs, and possibly other transactional
costs as well. But the Tribunal regards that as just another example of
actual economic loss or damage, which is subject to the usual rules of
proof. To resort instead to a purely discretionary award of moral solace
would be to subvert the burden of proof and the rules of evidence, and that
the Tribunal is not prepared to do.”

654. The Tribunal is of the view that, in any event, the doctrine of “clean hands” is

invoked in the present case and it precludes the awarding of such damages.

9, THE RESPONDENT’S COUNTERCLAIM

655. The Respondent counterclaims for an order from the Tribunal in the following
terms”!!;

“f To award to Respondent, and order the Claimant to pay to the

Respondent, forthwith, the full amount of the bailout, being Rp. 6.7 trillion;

or, alternatively the amount that he has been shown to have stolen, being

US $ 360,735,638; or such other sum as the Tribunal may determine

appropriate in light of the evidence put forward in this case, plus interest

on such amount from the date of Claimant's conviction until the date paid,
calculated at the Indonesian statutory interest rate of 6% per annum, or

such other rate as the Tribunal may order;”

656, The Respondent submits that, for the Respondent to succeed on the
counterclaim “...this Tribunal need make only three findings: first, that it has
jurisdiction to adjudicate the Respondent’s counterclaiin; second, that the
Claimant took actions to threaten Bank Century’s liquidity (whether such
actions were also criminal is beside the point for this analysis — although they

plainly were); third, that those actions inflicted losses on the Respondent”"!?,

657. The Respondent bases its counterclaim on the ‘various manipulations’ that
enriched ‘the Claimant and Mr. Riz:
relies on six specific types of fraud identified in the Brattle Report. The

 

 

..at the expense of Bank Century’. It

Respondent argues that “inescapable reality is that, if Messrs. Al Warrag and
Rizvi had not siphoned off Bank Century's funds for their own benefit— or even
if they had replaced them as required by the commitment letters — the
Indonesian Government would not have needed to step in to guarantee Bank

Century’s safety”,

658, In its Post-Hearing brief filed on 16 June 2014, the Respondent submits that

“In order to find for Indonesia on the counterclaim, therefore, this
Tribunal need not follow the tangled web of Mr, Al Warraq’s and Mr.
Rizvi’s trades and transactions (though it helps to have been through
them). All it need do is to conclude that Mr. Al Warrag had obligations as
a Commissioner of Bank Century, as a signatory to the Commitment
Letters, and as the partner in interest with the signatory of the AMA, to
give back what he and Mr. Rizvi had taken from Bank Century -- in cash

or in kind.”

659, Counterclaims are problematic in investment arbitration because of the
‘inherently asymmetrical character’ of an investment treaty. However, as a

21 ibid, paragraph 264)
(paragraph 314)

205

660.

matter of principle “tribunals should be able to hear closely connected
investment counterclaims arising under the investment contract. Otherwise the
maxim pacta sunt servanda operates in only one direction”(James Crawford
Treaty and Contract in investment Arbitration, the 22™ Freshfields Lecture on
International Arbitration, London 29, November 2007, page 17). “The

jurisdiction of an Arbitral Tribunal over a State party counterclaim under an

investment treaty depends upon the terms of the dispute resolution provisions of
the treaty, the nature of the counterclaim, and the relationship of the
counterclaims with the claims in the arbitration” (Limited Liability Company
Amto v Ukraine, SCC Case 080/2005, Award, paragraph 118, March 26, 2008).
“It is a cardinal principle relating to the bringing of counterclaims, however,
that the necessary parties to the counterclaim must be the same as the parties to
the primary claim” (Saluka Investments B.V. vy The Czech Republic, Decision on

Jurisdiction over the Czech Republic’s Counterclaim, paragraph 49).

The Tribunal is satisfied that the OIC Agreement, on a proper interpretation,
authorizes counterclaims by the state party. Firstly, Article 17, which establishes
the investor-State arbitration mechanism, envisages claims by the State party
{and arguably goes even further to contemplate that a State Party initiates
arbitration as a Claimant against an investor). Article 17, as far as is relevant

reads (emphasis added):

“Until an organ for the settlement of disputes arising under the agreement
is established, disputes that may arise shall be entitled through
conciliation or arbitration in accordance with the following rules of

procedure:

1, Conciliation: ... ...

2. Arbitration

a) If the two parties to the dispute do not reach an agreement as a result of
their resart to conciliation, or if the concitiator is unable to issue his report
within the prescribed period, or if the two parties do not accept the solutions
proposed therein, then each party has the right to resort to the Arbitration
Tribunal for a final decision on the dispute.

661.

662.

4)

 

(d) The decisions of the Arbitration Tribunal shall be final and cannot be
contested. They are binding on both parties who must respect and implement
them. They shall have the force of judicial decisions. The contracting parties
ave under an obligation to implement them in their territory, no matter
whether it be a party to the dispute or not and irrespective of whether the
investor against whoni the decision was passed is one of its nationals or
residents or not, as if it were a final and enforceable decision of its national

coms.”

As the Tribunal noted in its Partial Award dated 21 June 2012, paragraph 75,
“The opening phrase of Article 17 is ambiguously drafted. The reference to
“disputes” lacks a subject...” but the Tribunal found that it included disputes
between States and investors. Article 17(2)(a) then makes clear that if the dispute
is not resolved amicably then “each party”- that is, both the State and an investor
in an investor-State arbitration- may resort to arbitration, A party may exercise
‘a right to resort to arbitration’ either by commencing the arbitration itself, or
making a counterclaim if the other party commences the arbitration first. Finally,
Article 17(2)(d) imposes an obligation on other contracting States to implement
decisions against investors that are nationals of that state. In its ordinary
meaning, a ‘decision’ against an investor presupposes that the state party has a
right to bring a claim or counterclaim against the investor, which is consistent
with the remainder of Article 17, and preferable to restricting the meaning of
decision to procedural and costs matters in a procedure where only the investor

has a right of action.

There is further support for an interpretation of the OIC Agreement so as to

authorize counterclaims by state parties in Article 9, which provides:

“The investor shall be bound by the laws and regulations in force in the
host state and shall refrain from all acts that may disturb public order or

morals or that may be prejudicial to the public interest. He is also to

207

refrain from exercising restrictive practices and from trying to achieve

gains through unlawful means.”

663. Article 9 imposes a positive obligation on investors to respect the law of the Host
State, as well as public order and morals. An investor of course has a general
obligation to obey the law of the host state, but Article 9 raises this obligation
from the plane of domestic law (and jurisdiction of domestic tribunals) to a treaty
obligation binding on the investor in an investor state arbitration. An analogy
can be drawn with so called ‘umbrella clauses’ that elevate contractual
obligations to the treaty plane. The fact that the Contracting Parties imposed
treaty obligations on investors (which the Claimant assented to by accepting the
open offer of investment arbitration made by the Respondent in the OIC
Agreement) confirms the interpretation of Article 17 that permits counterclaims

by the respondent state.

664. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the OIC Agreement authorizes
counterclaims, and so the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide on the Respondent’s
counterclaim. There is additional support for the right to a counterclaim in the
procedural rules selected by the Parties and the terins of their Letter Agreement
regarding the arbitration of 25 November 2011?'*. The Parties selected the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Article 21.3 of which reads as follows:

“In its statement of defence, or at a later stage in the arbitral proceedings
if the arbitral tribunal decides that the delay was justified under the
circumstances, the respondent may make a counterclaim or rely on a claim
for the purpose of a set-off provided that the arbitral tribunal has

jurisdiction over it”.

665. The Letter of Agreement dated 25 November 2011, includes the following:

“Of the Tribunal rules in favour of your client [i.e, the Claimant] in relation

to the preliminary objections’ application, any further jurisdictional or

2\4See paragraph 13 of the Partial Award dated 21 June 2012.

 

208

admissibility objections, the merits and any counterclaim will be submitted

to the same Tribunal”?!

666. The Tribunal concludes therefore, that the Respondent has the right to file

counterclaims.

667. The right to bring counterclaiins under the OIC Agreement is very broad. Article
17 refers to ‘disputes’ between the investor and the State and does not
specifically limit the type of disputes. The fact that Article 9 establishes a treaty
obligation to respect the law of the host states confirms the absence of
restrictions on the nature of the counterclaim, and specifically the absence of an
express restriction on counterclaims arising from the investment. However, in
this case the counterclaim is closely related both to the investment and to the
Claimant’s claiins. The counterclaim, like the claims, centers on the bailout of
Bank Century in November 2008, with the Respondent alleging that the bailout
was a result of various frauds of the Claimant and Mr. Rizvi that caused

substantial losses to the Indonesian state,

668. The counterclaims are also based on similar facts as the criminal proceedings
against the Claimant in Indonesia. The Claimant invokes the principle of ne bis
in idem, which is an aspect of the res judicata doctrine. Pursuant to the principle
of res judicata “an earlier and final adjudication by a court or arbitration
tribunal is conclusive in subsequent proceedings involving the same subject

216 The extent to

matter or relief, the same legal grounds and the same parties
which the criminal prosecution of the Claimant in this case might preclude the
Respondent’s efforts to obtain compensation for losses from the same factual
circumstances that were the basis of the Claimant’s conviction is a difficult
question, and one that the Tribunal does not need to decide. The counterclaims

here fail on broader grounds.

669. The counterclaim does not distinguish the actions of the Claimant from the

actions of Mr. Rizvi, who is not a party to this arbitration. Further, they involve

asRy

various other entities, including FGAH, Tell Tale Holdings Limited and First
Capital Management Limited, not parties to this arbitration. As made clear in the
Saluka Investments BV. v The Czech Republic decision referred to above, it isa
‘cardinal principle’ that the necessary parties to the counterclaim must be the
same as the parties to the primary claim”, and while this might be formally so in
the present case there are many other entities that are either primarily or jointly
responsible for the alleged frauds. The Respondent has failed to define the

Claimant’s personal liability, and the counterclaim must fail.

Further, the counterclaim is based on frauds committed against Bank Century,
and the losses were initially incurred by bank Century and only passed on to the
State when a bailout of Bank Century was required. While the subrogation of the
State to claims of Bank Century might be juridically possible, the legal basis of
the Respondent’s rights to recover these losses has not been demonstrated to the

Tribunal in this case.

. Finally, some of the transactions that the Respondent alleges were fraudulent are

subject to their own dispute resolution clauses. For example, one of the frauds
relied upon by the Respondent involves losses arising from the failure to honour
the AMA Agreement. Not only is the AMA Agreement between two separate
entities (Bank Century and Telltop Holdings Limited), but it is subject both to
ithe non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and the Arbitration Rules

of the Singapore Internationa! Arbitration Centre.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has failed to
demonstrate an adequate legal basis for its counterclaim, which is accordingly

dismissed in its entirety.

Both Parties have claimed costs in the present arbitration and filed short

submissions quantifying their fees and costs,

Paragraph 24 of the Terms of Engagement provides as follows:

210

“The Parties shall be jointly and severally liable for the fees and expenses
of the Arbitral Tribunal (and as between themselves equally). The Arbitral
Tribunal shall require the Parties to pay deposits on account of its fees
and expenses from time to time. Such deposits will be placed with the
Singapore International Arbitration Centre as an independent stakeholder
upon its usual terms of stakeholding with its fees to be paid from the
deposits. If one party defaults in paying its share or any part thereof of a
deposit request, the other shall pay the full amount, with credit to be given

for such advance in the final award.”

675. In relation to the allocation of costs, Article 42 of the UNICTRAL Rules

provides:

“}. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the
unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may
apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that
apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the

case,

2, The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate,
in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to

another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs”.

676. At the Partial Award rendered on 21 Tune 2012, the Tribunal decided that the

677.

costs of the jurisdictional phase would be considered as part of the overall costs
of the procedure at the conclusion of the merits phase, and reserved all questions
relating to costs including costs involved in the proceedings relating to the
preliminary objection to jurisdiction to the conclusion (merits- phase) of the

arbitration.

The Claimant seeks reimbursement of GBP 1,318,377.59 in costs of legal fees
and GBP 93,317.74 in other costs, GBP 380,265.03 in costs of experts, and GBP
471,000 for the costs of arbitration

The Respondent seeks reimbursement of SGD 1,258,848.65 in costs of
Arbitrator’s fees, USD 5,500,000.00 in costs of counsel’s fees, USD 150,000.00
in costs of counsel’s hearing expenses, USD 625,000.00 in costs of experts’ fees,
USD 50,000.00 in costs of experts’ and witnesses’ expenses, USD 10,589.00 in
costs of translator’s fees and expenses and USD 68,023.00 in costs of fees and

expenses for delegations of the Government.

The Tribunal also notes that the Claimant has paid the amount of SGD
1,251,343.84, and the Respondent has paid SGD 1,251,729.13 towards the

deposit account of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.

In the current case the Claimant was partially successful in the preliminary
jurisdictional phase. The Claimant has also successfully demonstrated that the
most favoured nation clause in the OIC Agreement incorporates a fair and
equitable treatment standard, and that the Respondent has breached this standard
in relation to the trial and conviction of the Claimant. However, the Claimant
has not successfully recovered any damages, The Respondent has failed on the
jurisdictional issues, substantially succeeded on the merits, and has failed in its

counterclaim.

The Tribunal also notes that the Parties have argued their positions and filed their
submissions diligently and in good faith throughout the proceedings.

Based on the above and applying the principles in Article 42.1 of the
UNCITRAL Rules the Tribunal considers reasonable that each party shall bear
its own legal expenses and costs, as well as the expenses and costs of the
arbitration, including the Arbitrator’s fees and expenses and those of the

Singapore International Arbitration Centre.

683. For all the above reasons this Tribunal finds as follows?!”

1) The Claimant is an investor in Indonesia within the meaning of Article

1(6) of the OIC Agreement;

2) The Respondent did not expropriate the Claimant’s investment, and
therefore did not breach Article 10 of the OIC Agreement in its treatment
of the Claimant’s investment in Bank Century;

3) By reason of the operation of the most-favoured nation clause in Article 8
of the OIC Agreement, the Claimant as an investor was entitled to fair and
equitable treatment in the terms of the standard in Article 3 of the
Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of

Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments;

4) The Respondent’s conduct in the prosecution and conviction of the

Claimant breached the fair and equitable treatment standard;

5) The Claimant’s invested capital in Bank Century has enjoyed adequate
protection and security within the meaning of Article 2 of the OIC

Agreement;

217 The minority of the Tribunal believes that, by virtue of the violation of Articles S0(1), 51(b), 52, $4,
66-67, 233-4 and 263 of the KUHAP, Article 38(1) of the Anti-Corruption Law and Article 79(1) of the
Money Laundering Law, there has been a breach of the Claimant’s treaty rights under Article 13(1(d) of
the OIC Agreement, thus entitling him to damages for the lega) expenses he has incurred in relation to his
wrongful conviction by the Central Jakarta District Court, as well as the legal costs of defending himself
against asset seizure proceedings initiated by Indonesia in various jurisdictions to the extent that the
wrongful conviction was the basis for these enforcement actions.

 

 

 

The minority does not agree that the doctrine of ‘clean hands’ applies to render the Claimant’s claims
inadmissible by virtue of his illegality unless that illegality relates to the acquisition of his investment,
which is not the present case.

»)

(By a majority) the Claimant has breached Article 9 of the OIC Agreement
in that he committed acts prejudicial to the public interest, and for this
reason is not entitled to any damages in respect of the Respondent’s

breaches of the fair and equitable treatinent standard;

The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Respondent’s counterclaim under

the OIC Agreement, but the counterclaim is dismissed on the merits;

The Parties shall each bear one half of the fees and expenses of the Arbitral
Tribunal and the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. The Parties
shall each bear their own legal and other costs, including the fees and

expenses of witnesses and experts;
