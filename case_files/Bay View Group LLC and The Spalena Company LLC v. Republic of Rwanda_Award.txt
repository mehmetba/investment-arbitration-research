INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre’’) on the basis of the Treaty Between the
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of
Rwanda Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, which
entered into force on 1 January 2012 (the “BIT” or “Treaty”),' and the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which

entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The claimants are Bay View Group LLC (“Bay View” or “BVG”) and The Spalena
Company LLC (“Spalena”), two limited liability companies organized under the laws of

Delaware, United States of America (together, the “Claimants”).
The respondent is the Republic of Rwanda (“Rwanda” or the “Respondent”).

The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The

Parties’ representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

This dispute relates to the Claimants’ alleged investment in the acquisition and operation

of mining concessions in Rwanda.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 18 May 2018, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration dated 14 May 2018 from Bay
View Group LLC and Natural Resources Development Group against the Republic of
Rwanda, together with Exhibits A through J, which was supplemented by communication
of 31 May 2018. Following questions posed to the Requesting Parties by the ICSID
Secretariat, the 14 May 2018 Request for Arbitration was withdrawn and on 12 June 2018,
the Claimants submitted an Amended Request for Arbitration (the “Request” or “RFA”),

' Treaty Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Rwanda
Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, which entered into force on | January 2012
(“BIT”), RFA Exhibit 05.

together with Exhibits 01 through 11, which was supplemented by communications of 18

and 21 June 2018.

On 22 June 2018, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the
registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Acting Secretary-General invited the Parties
to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d)
of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration

Proceedings.

In the absence of an agreement between the Parties on the method of constituting the
Tribunal, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in

Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

The Tribunal is composed of the Rt. Hon. Lord Phillips KG, PC, a national of the United
Kingdom, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Mr. J. Truman Bidwell, Jr., a
national of the United States of America, appointed by the Claimants; and Ms. Barbara
Dohmann QC, a national of the Germany and the United Kingdom, appointed by the

Respondent.

On 3 October 2018, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), notified the
Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Alex Kaplan, ICSID Legal

Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

Following the constitution of the Tribunal, by letter dated 5 October 2018, the Respondent
requested that Mr. Bidwell provide further clarification to his disclosures made following
his appointment; the Respondent also “reserve[d] its right to propose the disqualification
of Mr. Bidwell.” Mr. Bidwell provided a response by letter of 15 October 2018 transmitted
by the Secretary of the Tribunal.

By email of 4 November 2018 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the President
of the Tribunal requested that the Respondent provide an update, by 7 November 2018, as

to whether it intends to propose the disqualification of Mr. Bidwell.

By email of 7 November 2018, the Respondent confirmed that it “does not intend to

propose the disqualification of Mr. Bidwell at this stage.”

Parties on 3 December 2018 by teleconference. At the first session, the Tribunal decided

that quantum shall be bifurcated from the merits in this proceeding.

would be Paris, France. Annex C of PO1 also sets out an agreed procedural calendar in the

preliminary objections from the merits

Tribunal decided the following with respect to the Respondent’s four preliminary

objections:

(ii) second objection (ratione personae): granted with regard to Bay View and denied

Also in PO2, the Tribunal directed that the Parties jointly determine a procedural calendar

Pursuant to PO2, by joint email of 12 July 2019, the Parties submitted a proposed
procedural calendar for the jurisdictional phase of the proceeding. Following exchanges
between the Tribunal and the Parties, the Parties submitted a revised procedural calendar
on 24 July 2019. By email of 25 July 2019 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal,

C-130; and Legal Authorities CL-051 through CL-060.

Having considered the Claimants’ Counter-Memorial, on 28 August 2019, and in
accordance with its ruling in PO2, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (“PO3”)
concerning the Respondent’s first objection (ratione temporis), wherein the Tribunal
reconsidered, in keeping with PO2, and denied the request to determine the first objection

as a bifurcated preliminary objection.

By letter of 30 August 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was therefore

proposed that the upcoming hearing be rescheduled to early April 2021 in Paris, France,

and invited the Parties to confirm their availability by 1 July 2020.

By letter of 25 June 2020, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was not available
for an in-person hearing in early April 2021 and requested that the hearing take place by
videoconference on the originally scheduled dates in October 2020. By email of 26 June
2020, the Claimants requested leave to respond to the Respondent’s letter by 29 June 2020.
By email of later that date transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal granted

the Claimants’ request.

By letter of 29 June 2020, the Claimants responded to the Respondent’s 25 June 2020 letter,

wherein they maintained that the hearing should be conducted in-person.

By letter of 1 July 2020 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal
confirmed that the hearing dates scheduled for October 2020 were vacated and invited the
Parties to consider holding the hearing in Paris, France, on certain dates in late April or late

June 2021. The Parties’ responses were requested by 6 July 2020.

By letter of later that date on 1 July 2020, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had
limited availability during the proposed hearing dates and reiterated its request that the
hearing be held remotely in October 2020. By letter of 2 July 2020, the Claimants
confirmed their availability to hold the hearing on any of the dates proposed by the

Tribunal.

By letter of 6 July 2020 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal directed
that each Party indicate its availability, by 10 July 2020, for an in-person hearing during
the first half of 2021.

On 7 July 2020 the Respondent filed a reinstated request for bifurcation, and a request that
the Tribunal order a change of venue for the hearing (the “Respondent’s Reinstated
Request”). Therein, the Respondent, inter alia, requested that (i) its ratione personae and
ratione voluntatis objections again be bifurcated from the merits, with those objections to
be heard during a remote hearing in October 2020; and (ii) the venue for a subsequent
hearing on the merits be changed from Paris, France, to London, United Kingdom. By
email of 8 July 2020 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal invited the
Claimants’ comments on the Respondent’s Reinstated Request by 15 July 2020.

Further to the Tribunal’s 6 July 2020 instructions, by letters of 10 July 2020, each Party
informed the Tribunal of its availability for an in-person hearing during the first half of

2021.
On 15 July 2020, the Claimants filed observations on the Respondent’s Reinstated Request.

By letter of 23 July 2020 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal:
(i) informed the Parties that the Respondent’s Reinstated Request was denied; and

(ii) confirmed that an in-person hearing would take place in June 2021 in Paris, France.

By letter of 30 July 2020, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to request certain orders
relating to the Respondent’s production of documents. Upon invitation from the Tribunal,
the Respondent responded by letter of 7 August 2020. By letter of 10 August 2020, the
Tribunal informed the Parties that it would make no further order with regard to the

Claimants’ request.

By letter of 3 August 2020, the Office of International Claims and Investment Disputes of
the Department of State of the United States of America (the “USA”) wrote to the Tribunal
to inform that it is considering making a non-disputing third party written submission in
this proceeding, pursuant to Article 28.2 of the BIT (the “USA Application”), and it

requested that the Tribunal fix the deadline for such submission on 19 February 2021.

By email of 4 August 2020 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal
requested that the Parties confirm that they had no objection to the USA making a written
submission as indicated in its Application; the Parties so confirmed by emails of later that

date.

By letter of 10 August 2020 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal
granted the USA Application and the deadline proposed therein.

On 19 August 2020, the Respondent filed an application for security for costs (the
“Respondent’s Security for Costs Application”), together with Exhibits R-244 and
R-245 and Legal Authorities RL-168 through RL-172.

Upon invitation from the Tribunal, on 9 September 2020, the Claimants filed observations
of the Respondent’s Security for Costs Application (the “Claimants’ Observations on

Security for Costs”), together with Legal Authorities CL-088 through CL-091.

On 11 September 2020, the Respondent filed a response to the Claimants’ Observations on
Security for Costs (the “Respondent’s Response on Security for Costs”). By email of
later that date, the Claimants informed the Secretary of the Tribunal that they rely on their
Observations on Security for Costs and will not file a rejoinder to the Response on Security

for Costs.

On 28 September 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 (“PO6” or the
“Decision on Security for Costs”) denying the Respondent’s Security for Costs

Application.

Further to the Tribunal’s letter of 10 August 2020, on 19 February 2021, the USA filed its
written submission as a non-disputing third party in the proceeding (the “USA

Submission”).

By email of 22 February 2021 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal
informed the Parties that, should either Party wish to do so, it may respond to the USA

Submission by 2 April 2021. No responses were received from the Parties.

By letter of 3 March 2021, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to request that the
upcoming June 2021 hearing be held by videoconference, in light of the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic. Upon invitation from the Tribunal, the Claimants responded by
letter of 8 March 2021; in their letter, the Claimants argued that the Respondent’s request
be denied at this time and the issue be revisited in mid-May 2021. Upon invitation from
the Tribunal, the Respondent provided observations on the Claimants’ 8 March 2020 letter
by letter of 11 March 2021.

By email of 31 March 2021 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal
informed the Parties that the June 2021 hearing will take place by videoconference. The
Tribunal also proposed the following (the “hybrid hearing modality”): (i) the Members
of the Tribunal will use their best efforts to sit together in London, United Kingdom; (ii)
as such, each Party will need to consent to hold the hearing in London in lieu of Paris
pursuant to Article 63 of the ICSID Convention; (iii) core members of each Party’s legal
team are invited to appear in-person before the Tribunal to make oral submissions and
conduct direct- and cross-examinations; and (iv) in the interest of fairness, witnesses should
appear remotely. The Tribunal invited the Parties’ observations on the hybrid hearing

modality by 7 April 2021.

Each Party provided its observations on the hybrid hearing modality by letters of 7 April
2021. The Respondent consented to changing the location of the hearing to London and to
make oral submissions before the Tribunal in-person, but did not believe it to be necessary
for counsel to attend in-person to conduct direct- and cross- examinations. The Claimants
also consented to changing the location of the hearing to London and indicated their

preference for counsel to attend the hearing in-person for its entirety, including while

ll

conducting conduct direct- and cross- examinations. In their letter, the Claimants requested

that their representative, Mr. Roderick Marshall, be allowed to attend the hearing in-person.

By letter of 8 April 2021, the Respondent responded to the Claimants’ 7 April 2020 letter
wherein it, inter alia, objected to the in-person attendance of Mr. Marshall at the hearing.

The Claimants responded by letter of 9 April 2021.

By letter of 18 April 2021 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal wrote
to the Parties concerning the hybrid hearing modality. The Tribunal (i) took note of the
Parties’ agreement, pursuant to Article 63 of the ICSID Convention, to change the location
of the hearing to London, United Kingdom; (ii) indicated its preference that that the
examination of witnesses be done by both Parties from the hearing room in the presence of
the Tribunal; and (iii) determined that, in the interest of equal treatment, Mr. Marshall will
not be permitted to take part in the proceedings in the hearing room, whether as a witness

or as the Claimants’ representative.

By email of 14 May 2021, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties on behalf
of the Tribunal a draft Procedural Order No. 7 (““PO7”) concerning the hearing protocol
and requested their comments by 25 May 2021. The Secretary also inquired as to the

Parties’ availability for a pre-hearing organizational meeting.

By letter of 21 May 2021, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that their counsel would

attend the hearing remotely in light of COVID-19 travel restrictions.

Also by letter of 21 May 2021 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal
proposed the appointment of Dr. Anna Loutfi as Assistant to the Tribunal and requested
the Parties’ agreement by 28 May 2021. The Parties subsequently agreed to Dr. Loutfi’s
appointment by the Claimants’ email of 27 May and the Respondent’s email of 28 May
2021.

By emails of 25 May 2021, the Parties provided to the Tribunal their comments on draft
PO7 and noted their areas of disagreement. By email of 26 May 2021 transmitted by the

Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal encouraged the Parties to continue their

65.

consultations on draft PO7 with a view to reaching agreement where possible, and to

propose a notional hearing schedule before the pre-hearing organizational meeting.

On 4 June 2021, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by
videoconference. Also on 4 June 2021, the Secretary of the Tribunal wrote to
representatives of the United States of America to inquire whether they wished to attend

and to make oral submissions at the hearing.

By email of 8 June 2021, representatives of the United States confirmed that they would

attend the hearing but would not make oral submissions.

On 9 June 2021, the Tribunal issued the final version of PO7 concerning the organization
of the hearing. PO7 clarified, inter alia, that in the interest of equality of arms, counsel are
not invited to appear in person before the Tribunal, given that one counsel team is unable

to travel to London to appear in person at the hearing.
Pursuant to PO7, on 17 June 2021, each Party submitted a Pre-Hearing Brief.

A hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held from 21 to 30 June (weekends excluded)
by videoconference (the “Hearing”). On the first day of the hearing, the Tribunal
confirmed that the hearing would be “open to the public” as required by the BIT. The
President proposed to the Parties that, in light of the virtual modality of the hearing, the
hearing would be made public by posting recordings, with confidential information
redacted, of the hearing on the ICSID website. The Parties agreed on the record with the
Tribunal’s proposal. Video recordings with the Parties’ agreed redactions were

subsequently posted on the ICSID website.

Neither Party so requested.

The proceeding was closed on 7 February 2021.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND

THE FOUNDATION OF THE CLAIM

The Claimants in this arbitration are two Delaware Companies, BVG and Spalena, formed

by an American citizen, Mr. Roderick Marshall, as investment vehicles for himself and

15

76.

77.

78.

other American investors. The Claimants allege that they invested in the mining industry
in Rwanda by acquiring, on 23 December 2010, a controlling interest ina Rwandan mining

company, Natural Resources Development (Rwanda) Ltd. (“NRD”);?

and, thereafter,
directing and funding the activities of NRD. In their Memorial, the Claimants submit that

they

invested in the acquisition of the NRD, and all of NRD’s assets,
including the Rutsiro, Mara, Sebeya, Giciye and Nemba
Concessions.*

The Claimants allege that the Rwanda breached obligations owed to them under the BIT.

The driving force behind the initiation and conduct of this arbitration on behalf of the
Claimants has, unquestionably, been Mr. Marshall. He is the founder, principal shareholder
in, and Managing Director of, each of the Claimants. He also acted as the Managing
Director of NRD and directed its activities once it had been acquired by Spalena. As the
Claimants’ principal witness, Mr. Marshall was cross-examined over a period of some four
days. It appeared to the Tribunal that Mr. Marshall was labouring under a burning sense
that he — in person and the Claimants’ investments, in the form of NRD and its mining

business — had been unfairly treated by Rwanda.

The Tribunal’s appraisal of the witnesses will be dealt with in due course, in the context of
the evidence that they have given. It is right, however, to observe at the outset that Mr.
Marshall’s perception that he was the victim of injustice appears to have led him to give
evidence that was repeatedly at odds with contemporary documents and manifestly
inaccurate. His response to documents that conflicted with his evidence was frequently to
suggest that they were fabricated — suggestions that were not put by counsel to the relevant
witnesses in cross-examination. On other occasions Mr. Marshall made, for the first time,
allegations of fact that one would have expected to feature in the pleadings or in witness
statements and which the Tribunal has not been able to accept. In short, Mr. Marshall was

not a reliable witness.

The story starts in or about 2006. At this time, Rwanda was bent on accelerating a policy
of privatizing mining that had previously been carried on under control of the State. To this
end, standard form contracts (“Four-Year Contracts”) were being issued to companies
under which they were granted four-year authorisations both to explore and to exploit
designated mining concessions, with a view to obtaining long-term licences to mine these

concessions at the end of the four-year period.
It is the Claimants’ case that

it was well understood in the mining community that once a

company obtained a contract for acquiring a concession the long-

term licences were guaranteed.”
It is Mr. Marshall’s evidence that he was asked by Rwandan representatives to procure
American investment in mining in Rwanda and repeatedly assured that if he invested in a
concession he would be granted a right to mine that concession for thirty years, with the
possibility of a renewal. He learned that all concession holders received “the same

guarantee” .°

Under the influence of these assurances, Mr. Marshall formed BVG to invest in the
Rwandan mining industry and, on 23 March 2007, signed on behalf of that Company the
standard form Four-Year Contract in respect of a concession at Bisesero (the “Bisesero

Concession”).’

Meanwhile, on 10 July 2006, two German investors, each called Zarnack, together with a
Rwandan, Mr. Ben Benzinge, formed NRD. The Zarnacks were the majority shareholders,
holding 85% of the shares of NRD through a holding company (the “Holding Company”),
while Mr. Benzinge held the remaining 15% of the shares in NRD.*

On 24 November 2006, Rwanda concluded a Four-Year Contract (the “Contract”) with

NRD in respect of the following five concessions: Rutsiro, Mara, Sebeya, Giciye and

Nemba (the “Five Concessions”).’ Pursuant to the Contract, on 29 January 2007, Rwanda
issued to NRD individual exploration and exploitation “special permits” in respect of each
of the Five Concessions! (the “Five Special Permits”). The Zarnacks pledged that they

would invest US$39 million in the Concessions over a five-year period. !!

85. Towards the end of 2008, the Zarnacks sold their interests in the Holding Company to H.C.
Starck GmbH (“Starck”), '? an established German mineral processing company. The

Holding Company was renamed “HC Starck Resources GMBH”. '>

86. On 29 November 2010, NRD, under the direction of Starck, made a licence application to
Rwanda (the “2010 Application”). ' It is the Claimants’ case that, at this point, NRD had
acquired a contractual right pursuant to the Contract to long-term mining licences for a
period of 35 years in respect of each of the Five Concessions covered by the Contract and
that the 2010 Application was an application for these long-term licences. Rwanda
contends that NRD had failed to qualify under the Contract for the grant of long-term

licences and that the 2010 Application was for short-term licences.

87. On 23 December 2010, Starck sold the Holding Company to Spalena (the “Spalena
Purchase Contract”) for a stated purchase price of i: It is the Claimants’ case
that BVG contributed to this transaction in a manner that gave it an interest in NRD that

founds its Jocus standi as a Claimant in this Arbitration. Rwanda denies this.

THE CLAIMANTS?’ CASE IN A NUTSHELL

As explained at paragraph 86 above, it is the Claimants’ case that, at the time of their
acquisition of NRD, NRD enjoyed a vested right under the Contract to long-term mining
licences for the Five Concessions. It is also the Claimants’ case that they, and NRD, had
and retained a legitimate expectation, which persisted up to 2016, that these long-term
licences would be granted by Rwanda. The Claimants allege that conduct on the part of
Rwanda that infringed obligations owed to the Claimants under the BIT deprived them of

their long-term interests in the Five Concessions and defeated their legitimate expectation.

The Claimants make the following arguments. From the time of the 2010 Application up
to 2016, Rwanda permitted NRD to remain in possession of the Five Concessions, initially
pursuant to a series of short extensions to their special permits, but subsequently pursuant
to an unwritten, informal licence. Throughout this period NRD continued to expect to
receive long-term licences for the Five Concessions. In the course of this period there was
a series of incidents that interfered with NRD’s enjoyment of its licences over the Five
Concessions. Rwanda was responsible for these incidents and each, individually,
constituted a breach of Rwanda’s obligations to the Claimants under the BIT, as set out
under Section IV below. They were motivated by Rwanda’s desire to pressurize NRD into
abandoning the Five Concessions by what is sometimes described as “creeping
expropriation”. Ultimately, in 2016, Rwanda expropriated the Five Concessions. Only at
this point did it become reasonably apparent to the Claimants that the earlier incidents

constituted breaches of the BIT.

The reason alleged by the Claimants for Rwanda’s wish to drive NRD to abandon the Five
Concessions was to facilitate “smuggling”, this being the marketing or minerals originating
in the RDC, sometimes described as the Belgian Congo, as being mined in Rwanda, to the

profit of the latter country.

At the start of the Hearing the Tribunal asked Mr. Cowley, counsel for the Claimants, for
clarification of a matter that was not clear on the pleadings. The Claimants had alleged a
number of individual breaches of the BIT over a period of years, culminating in the alleged

expropriation of NRD’s interests in the Five Concessions. Were the Claimants making

19

92.

93.

94,

95.

96.

individual claims for damages in relation to each of these incidents, or were they relying
on them solely as incidents in a process of expropriation that reached its conclusion in

2016?

Mr. Cowley said that it was the latter, but went on to elaborate on this answer at some
length. '° He said that the expropriation was not a one-off event but very long, slow process
that bled NRD of all its money over time. A claim could have been made based on actions

by Rwanda

that caused some seizure of property, some blocking of being able
to profit and earn revenue from minerals and seizing of other
property which wound up in losses with the conduct of their agent,
the person they worked through, Mr. Benzinge, or the person they
allowed to act in such a malicious way, taking materials{.]""

The Claimants had to decide whether to sue for this, but they did not and they had not:

So as a stand alone event, the seizure of the property and then return
of the property, and now equipment is missing, now things are gone,
the loss of profits over the period of time that there was no tagging,
are not being sued upon independently. They are part of the
sustained losses that went into a prolonged expropriation {...].'®

The Claimants allege that the totality of their losses exceeds US$95,000,000..'°
The factual investigation that followed at the Hearing involved examining the individual

incidents that the Claimants alleged had violated the BIT and constituted stepping stones

in the path of expropriation. The Tribunal has followed that course in this Award.
THE RESPONDENT’S CASE IN A NUTSHELL

Rwanda submits that the claims are misconceived and hopeless. In the first place, they do
not fall within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. Secondly, NRD at no time had any right to

be granted long-term licences, nor did NRD or the Claimants have any legitimate

expectation that NRD would receive these. After 2010, formal short-term licence
extensions were granted to NRD to continue to occupy and exploit the Five Concessions.
These were followed by a period of informal indulgence on the part of Rwanda in NRD
continuing to do so, which Rwanda ultimately terminated. There was no expropriation, nor
anything to expropriate. So far as any interferences with NRD’s enjoyment of the Five
Concessions during the period of short-term licence extensions or informal indulgence,
these were, with one exception, not attributable to Rwanda. That exception — the denial of
tags needed to market minerals — was properly and lawfully imposed. None of the matters

complained of was capable of constituting a breach of Rwanda’s obligations under the BIT.

Rwanda submits that the allegation that it set out to expropriate the Five Concessions in
order to facilitate smuggling is a scurrilous fiction that those representing the Claimants

were ultimately not prepared to pursue on the Claimants’ behalf.
CHRONOLOGY OF FURTHER RELEVANT EVENTS

This chronology will include each of the incidents that the Claimants allege violated the
BIT and, cumulatively, amounted to “creeping expropriation” of the Claimants’ interests
in the Five Concessions. Each of these incidents will be numbered and identified as

follows: “CE No. ”.

On 23 March 2007, BVG was awarded a Four-Year Contract”? in respect of the Bisesero
Concession.7! This did not lead to the grant of any further rights in relation to Bisesero —
the Claimants contend that Rwanda “expropriated” the Concession in November 2011.7
No claim has been advanced in respect of this allegation in this arbitration or at all, but it

has relevance to BVG’s case on jurisdiction.

On 11 August 2008, Rwanda Law No. 37/2008 on Mining and Quarry Exploitation (the
“2008 Law”) came into force. This made provision, inter alia, for the grant of short-term

exploration and exploitation mining rights.

In the 2010 Application, NRD stated that the company had a workforce of 334 permanent
employees and 2000 contracted miners. These so-called artisanal miners extracted ore,
largely from open sites, and sold it to NRD, for onward sale. Rwanda avers that this

remained the nature of NRD’s mining business between 2011 and 2014.7°

Throughout this period there was an exchange of correspondence between NRD and
Rwanda in relation to the grant to NRD of licences for the Five Concessions. In some
instances, the Parties are at odds as to the nature and length of the licences under discussion.
It is the Claimants’ case that representatives of Rwanda continued to reassure NRD that

long-term licences would be granted in respect of the Five Concessions.

On 2 August 2012, the Office of the Registrar General, under the control of the Rwanda
Development Board (“RDB”), altered NRD’s Registration to record that Mr. Benzinge,
rather than Mr. Marshall, was Managing Director.** On 6 August 2012, after complaint
from Mr. Marshall, he was re-instated in the Register as Managing Director.*> The
Claimants allege that, in the interim, Mr. Benzinge occupied NRD’s offices, stole minerals,
fired employees and caused a brief period of chaos, “with the RDB’s backing”?® (CE
No. 1).

In September 2012, mining operations were suspended in the three western concession
areas — Rutsiro, Sebeya and Giciye — purportedly on the ground of environmental concerns
arising from illegal mining?’ (CE No. 2). NRD was permitted to resume operations in these
areas on 10 February 2013.7* The Claimants allege that during the period of suspension
Rwanda permitted illegal mining to take place. This caused environmental damage that

resulted in physical damage to NRD’s property (CE No. 3).

On 17 May 2013, an Arbitrator, Me Nelly Umugwaneza handed down an award (the
“17 May Award”) in an arbitration between Mr. Benzinge as ‘Plaintiff’ and NRD as
‘Defendant’.”? This declared, among other things, that the sale of NRD to Starck was
illegal and that Mr. Marshall and Ms. Mruskovicova, Mr. Marshall’s partner, should be
removed as Directors. The Award ordered NRD to pay Mr. Benzinge a total of 16.3 million
Rwandan Francs, of which 6.3 million was stated to be “the sum he paid for the company

in the present case” and 10 million to be in respect of advocate fees.

No one purporting to act for NRD took part in the arbitration. Mr. Marshall, purporting to
act for NRD, challenged the decision, unsuccessfully, on purely procedural grounds, before

the High Court?° and the Supreme Court.*!

Following this there was a period of some two months during which NVD’s property at
Kigali and Nemba was seized by a Court Bailiff, Mr. Jean Bosco Nsengiyuma (“Bailiff
Bosco”), purportedly as part of a process of enforcing judgments outstanding against NRD
in favour of miners and others, including Mr. Benzinge. The Claimants contend that

Rwanda was privy to these proceedings and that they were not legitimate (CE No. 4).

Meanwhile, on 20 May 2014, Rwanda Law No. 13/2014 on Mining and Quarry
Operations *? (the “2014 Law”) came into force. Subject to exceptions, anyone seeking a
mining licence was required to make a fresh application for this in accordance with the
provisions of the 2014 Law. Provisions in respect of the length of licences that could be

granted were made more flexible.

Rwanda had put in place a system under which ore lawfully mined in Rwanda was bagged
and tagged. Without tags the ore could not lawfully be sold. In the summer of 2014,
Rwanda withdrew the supply of tags from NRD, on the ground that NRD was persisting in

carrying on business without formal licences and because there was doubt as to the

ownership of the Company. The Claimants allege that this was discriminatory and unfair

(CE No. 5).

On 18 August 2014, Rwanda requested NRD to re-apply for licences in relation to the Five
Concessions in accordance with the 2014 Law.** The Claimants allege that this
requirement was unlawful, discriminatory and breached the requirements of due process

(CE No. 6).

NRD nonetheless purported to comply with this request under cover of a letter of
18 September 2014.*+ The re-application was rejected by Rwanda on 24 November
2014,*5 subject to a right of appeal. NRD exercised that right, but its re-application was
finally rejected by Rwanda on 19 May 2015.*° It is the Claimants’ case that this was the
final step in the process of creeping expropriation of their rights in respect of the Five
Concessions (CE. No. 7) but that they did not reasonably appreciate this to be the case until

March 2016 when Rwanda put the Five Concessions out to public tender (CE No. 8).

On 12 June 2015, Mr. Evode Imena, the Minister of Mining, wrote to Mr. Marshall,*”
referring to Rwanda’s letter of 19 May 2015. He stated that his Ministry had appointed a
technical evaluation team to check that NRD had complied with Rwanda’s mining and
environmental laws during its period of occupation of the Concessions. It is Rwanda’s case
that this letter would have dispelled any doubts on the part of NRD that the previous letter
of 19 May was intended to bring NRD’s occupation of the Concessions to an end. The

Claimants deny that this letter was ever received. Rwanda submits that this is not credible.

IV. THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
A. THE BIT

113. The provisions of the BIT that the Claimants allege Rwanda has violated are the

following. **

Article 3: National Treatment

1. Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment
no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its
own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition,
expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other
disposition of investments in its territory.

2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less
favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments
in its territory of its own investors with respect to the establishment,
acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale
or other disposition of investments.

[...]
Article 4: Most-Favored Nation Treatment

1. Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment
no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to
investors of any non-Party with respect to the establishment,
acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale
or other disposition of investments in its territory.

2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less
favorable than it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in
its territory of any non-Party with respect to the establishment,
acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale
or other disposition of investments.

Article 5: Minimum Standard of Treatment
1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in

accordance with customary international law, including fair and
equitable treatment and full protection and security.

38 BIT, RFA Exhibit 05, Arts. 3(1)-3(2), 4, 5(1)-(2), 6(1)(c)

25

2. For greater certainty, paragraph I prescribes the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to
covered investments. The concepts of “fair and equitable treatment”
and “full protection and security” do nor require treatment in
addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and
do not create additional substantive rights. The obligation in
paragraph I to provide:

(a) “fair and equitable treatment” includes the
obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or
administrative adjudicatory proceedings in
accordance with the principle of due process
embodied in the principal legal systems of the world;
and

(b) “full protection and security” requires each Party to
provide the level of police protection required under
customary international law.

 

LJ
Article 6: Expropriation and Compensation
1. Neither party may expropriate or nationalize a covered

investment either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent
to expropriation or nationalization (“expropriation”’), except

[.]

(o) on payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation; [...]

[A footnote provides that Article 6 is to be interpreted in accordance
with Annexes A and B. Annex B provides:]

Expropriation
The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:

1. Article 6(1) is intended to reflect customary international law
concerning the obligation of States with respect to expropriation.

2. An action or series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an
expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible
property right or property interest in an investment.

3. Article 6(1) addresses two situations. [...]

26

4. The second situation addressed by Article 6(1) is indirect
expropriation, where an action or series of actions by a Party has
an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer
of title or outright seizure.

(a) The determination of whether an action or series of
actions by a Party, in a specific fact situation,
constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a
case-by-case, fact-based inquiry [...]

B. THE CLAIMANTS’ ALLEGATIONS OF BREACH OF THE BIT

114. The Claimants place at the forefront of their case the allegation that Rwanda’s conduct
repeatedly infringed the duty imposed under Article 5 of the BIT to afford the Claimants’

investments “fair and equitable treatment”. The following breaches are alleged:

(ji Rwanda “eviscerated” the Claimants’ legitimate expectation that NRD would be
granted long-term licences over the Five Concessions, discriminating in favour of

other applicants; *°

(ii) | Rwanda required NRD to re-apply for licences after the 2014 Law came into force
in circumstances where this was contrary to law, in breach of due process and

discriminatory “° (CE No. 6);

(iii) | Rwanda refused to supply NRD with tags in 2014, thereby discriminating against
NRD#! (CE No. 5);

(iv) | Rwanda barred NRD from the Western Concessions (i.e., Rutsiro, Sebeya and

Giciye) in 20124? (CE No. 2):

(v) Rwanda colluded in the thefts of NRD’s property by Mr. Benzinge in 2012 (CE
No. 1); and

(vi) | Rwanda colluded in Bailiff Bosco’s unlawful seizures of NRD’s property in 2014#
(CE No. 4).

The Claimants allege that some of the incidents violated Rwanda’s obligation to afford

their investments “full protection and security” pursuant to Article 5:

(ji Rwanda failed to protect NRD’s property in the Western Concessions from damage
during the period that mining by NRD was suspended there in 2012-3 *> (CE No. 3);

and

(ii) | Rwanda failed to prevent the thefts of NRD’s property perpetrated by Mr. Benzinge
in 2012*° (CE No. 1).

It is the Claimants’ case that these individual breaches of the BIT, culminating in the events
that constituted CE No. 7 and CE No. 8, amounted to unlawful expropriation of the

Claimants’ investments in violation of Article 6 of the BIT. The confiscation was of the
Claimants’ tangible property and assets as well as intangible
contractual rights to which Claimants were entitled.”

The Claimants allege that, insofar as treatment of NRD that breached Article 5 was not
applied to other investors, Rwanda discriminated against the Claimants in a manner that

infringed its obligations under Articles 3 and 4 of the BIT.
RELIEF SOUGHT BY THE CLAIMANTS

As this phase of the arbitration is restricted to issues of jurisdiction and liability only,
pursuant to the Parties’ agreement and the Tribunal’s Order captured in Section 14.1 of

Procedural Order No. 1, the Claimants simply seek the following relief:

“4 Cl. Mem., paras. 205, 207, 211.

46 Cl. Mem., para. 228.

28

Claimants request that the Tribunal find that Rwanda has breached
its duties under the BIT and find in favor of Claimants on the issue
[of] liability. *®

D. THE RESPONDENT’S CASE

119. Rwanda contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain any of the claims

advanced. As to these claims, Rwanda challenges each and every breach of the BIT alleged

by the Claimants:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

(vii)

The Claimants had no legitimate expectation that long-term licences would be
granted to NRD. Nor would such an expectation, if legitimate, found any obligation

on the part of Rwanda under the BIT;

NRD was properly required to re-apply for licences under the 2014 Law (CE
No. 6);

Rwanda’s refusal to supply NRD with tabs in 2014 was lawful and not
discriminatory (CE No. 5);

The closure of the western concession areas in 2012 was effected by local

government on valid environmental grounds (CE No. 2);

If damage occurred in those areas, or property was stolen by Mr. Benzinge or
others, this was not attributable to any failure on the part of Rwanda to observe the
required standard of “full protection and security” required by Article 5 of the BIT
(CE No. 3 and CE No. 1);

Seizures and sales of NRD’s property by the bailiff Bosco were carried out in lawful
execution in respect of judgment debts owed by NRD and were independent of

government (CE No. 4);

The Claimants owned no interests in the Five Concessions that were capable of

being expropriated contrary to Article 6 or at all (CE No. 7 and CE No. 8).

E. RELIEF SOUGHT BY THE RESPONDENT
120. Rwanda requests the Tribunal to:

[1.] Dismiss the Claimants’ claims for lack of jurisdiction [...];

[2.] Alternatively, dismiss the Claimants’ claims on the merits;

[3.] Order the Claimants’ to pay Rwanda the full costs of this
arbitration, including, without limitation, arbitrators’ fees
and expenses, administrative costs, counsel fees, expenses
and any other costs associated with this arbitration;

[4.] Order the Claimants to pay Rwanda interest on the amounts
awarded under paragraph [3] above until the date of full

payment; and

[5.] Grant any further relief to Rwanda as it may deem
appropriate.”

Vv. JURISDICTION
A. INTRODUCTION

121. Rwanda challenges the jurisdiction of this Tribunal in relation to the claims brought by

each of the Claimants on the following grounds:
(ji Lack of jurisdiction ratione temporis;

(ii) Lack of jurisdiction ratione personae; and
(iii) Lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae.

122. Rwanda further challenges the jurisdiction of this Tribunal in relation to the claims brought

by Spalena on the ground of:
(iv) Lack of jurisdiction ratione voluntatis.

123. The Tribunal proposes to address these challenges one by one.

LACK OF JURISDICTION RATIONE TEMPORIS

qd) The Claimants’ Case

Article 2(3) of the BIT provides:

For greater certainty, this Treaty does not bind either Party in
relation to any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased
to exist before the date of entry into force of this Treaty.>°

The BIT entered into force on 1 January 2012.
Article 26(1) of the BIT provides:

No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more

than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant

first acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of the breach

alleged under Article 24(1) and knowledge that the claimant [...]

has incurred loss or damage.*!
The application of these provisions requires the Tribunal to establish in relation to any
alleged breach of the BIT (i) the date upon which the Claimants submitted their claims and
(ii) the dates on which the Claimants first acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of

the breaches in question.

Section IV of the Claimants’ Memorial sets out the basis upon which the Claimants contend
that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute. No mention is made in this Section of
the temporal restrictions on jurisdiction set out above. The Claimants’ positive case in

relation to the temporal issues is to be found in their Counter-Memorial.

a. The Cut-Off Date

The first question to be resolved is the date on which the Claimants first submitted their
claims. The date upon which the original Request for Arbitration was submitted was
14 May 2018. The date on which the Amended Request for Arbitration was submitted was
12 June 2018.

133.

The Claimants have proceeded on the premise that the relevant date is the earlier of the
two, citing paragraph 39 of PO2.*? Thus it is the Claimants’ case that the earliest date, or
“Cut-off Date”, for knowledge of a violation of the BIT capable of giving rise to a claim

in this arbitration is 14 May 2015.

b. Breach Dates

As demonstrated above, almost all the incidents upon which the Claimants rely as
constituting breaches of the BIT occurred before 14 May 2015 (CE Nos. 1 to 6). The
Claimants devote some 31 pages of their Counter-Memorial to explaining how it is that all

that these incidents fall nonetheless within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

The Claimants’ primary case, developed over pages 8 to 35, is that all the individual
incidents (i.e., CE Nos. 1 to 6), formed part of a single process of unlawful expropriation
of the Claimants’ interests in the Five Concessions, which process was not completed until
the final act of expropriation (this being CE No. 8). The relevant date for any time bar was

that of the last incident:

Claimants suffered a creeping expropriation based on Respondents’
extensive history of mistreatment of their investment. All of these
prior acts should be considered in the aggregate for the purpose of
determining whether there was an expropriation. >

Claimants submit that, where a number of incidents are aggregated in this way, the relevant
date for the purposes of limitation is that on which the “/ast action or omission occurs” .*+
An alternative way that the Claimants’ case is advanced is that Rwanda’s final acts of
expropriation opened the Claimants’ eyes to the true nature of the Respondent’s earlier
conduct. They assert that up to the final expropriation the Claimants had always expected
that NRD would ultimately be granted the long-term licences to which it was contractually
entitled. The individual incidents were not incompatible with this expectation. The

Claimants had no reason to believe that Rwanda was discriminating against NRD in

comparison to other concession holders. Only at the moment of final expropriation contrary
to Article 6 of the BIT did the Claimants see the earlier events in their true light and
appreciate that these were incidents of ill-treatment that violated duties owed by Rwanda

under other Articles of the BIT:

It was not until Respondent expropriated Claimants’ investment, in
violation of Article 6 of the BIT, that Claimants knew or should have
known that Respondent had also violated Articles 3-5 of the BIT and
did not treat Claimants’ investments fairly and transparently, did
not provide full protection and security, and did not treat the
Claimants in accordance with the National Treatment and Most-
Favoured-Nation obligations.

[...] [It was not until Respondent effected an expropriation, on or
after May 19, 2015, that Claimants realized that all of the bad acts
suffered at the hands of Respondent were not merely steps towards
getting the long-term licence but were, in fact, designed to harm and
damage the Claii through damage to their in

 

 

Underpinning all of these submissions is the Claimants’ case that the object of the creeping
expropriation perpetrated by Rwanda was Rwanda’s concern that the presence of NRD in
the Five Concessions was inhibiting the smuggling of minerals from the Democratic

Republic of Congo (“DRC”):

The underlying reason for the expropriation was Respondent's
desire to better control the smuggling of minerals from the DRC.*°
This was not an allegation that had featured large in the Claimants’ Memorial. That simply

alleges:

Rwanda has given no indication that it cares whether the minerals
it tags originate in Rwanda, the DRC, or elsewhere. Instead,
Rwanda turns a blind eye to smuggling and the GMD tag managers
issued tags when requested, without asking questions.”

Now the Claimants allege that smuggling in Rwanda was controlled by a number of

powerful Rwandan oligarchs, with close links to the Government. One of these put pressure

CLC.

C-Mem., Sec. II.B.4.

57 Cl. Mem., para. 118.

33

on Rwanda to force the Claimants to cooperate or abandon the Concessions. The
Government saw fit to make sure that a company with American investors that was not
willing to assist in illegal smuggling would not stand in the way of a very profitable

operation — one that brought tax revenues to Rwanda. **

(2) The Respondent’s Case
a. The Cut-Off Date

137. Rwanda’s submissions were originally made in its Memorial and elaborated in its

Rejoinder.

138. Rwanda challenges the Claimants’ assumption, based on PO2, that the Cut-Off Date is
14 May 2015. It observes that PO2 refers to May 14 2015 as “the first ‘Cut-Off Date”.*°

139. Rwanda argues that the first Cut-Off Date is derived from the original Request for
Arbitration, submitted on 14 May 2018. That Request was rejected by ICSID, according to
Rwanda. Rwanda submits that the claim that is the subject of this arbitration is the one
advanced by the Amended Request for Arbitration on 12 June 2018; therefore, the true
Cut-Off Date is three years prior, i.e., 12 June 2015.°°

b. Breach Dates
140. So far as the individual heads of claim are concerned, Rwanda submits that none of these

arose after the Cut-Off Date.

141. Rwanda challenges the Claimants’ approach of aggregating a series of incidents and
attributing to them the date upon which the last one occurred, citing Rusoro Mining v.

Venezuela for the proposition that

[...] the better approach for applying the time bar consists in
breaking down each alleged composite claim into individual

145.

breaches, each referring to a certain governmental measure, and to
apply the time bar to each of such breaches separately.°!
On the premise that the refusal to grant long-term licences was an expropriation, which

Rwanda denies,

the Respondent's decision not to grant long-term licences to NRD
was clearly known to NRD by 2 August 2011.

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis
a. The Cut-Off Date

The Tribunal holds that the Cut-Off Date for limitation purposes is 12 June 2015. The claim
advanced in this arbitration is that submitted in the Amended Request for Arbitration of 12
June 2018 and not the original Request for Arbitration. The original Request included
claims by NRD, a company that had no /ocus standi. In these circumstances, the Request

was withdrawn. This arbitration is founded on the Amended Request for Arbitration.

b. Breach Dates

The Claimants’ case described above was advanced at a time when the Tribunal had
directed bifurcation so as to enable questions of jurisdiction to be determined in advance
of the merits. In advancing their case, the Claimants emphasized that the Tribunal would
be obliged, for the purpose of dealing with objections to jurisdiction, to proceed on the
basis that the Claimants’ allegations of fact were true. Article 28(4)(c) of the BIT expressly

so provides.

As the bifurcation did not take place, a hearing on jurisdiction and the merits took place
simultaneously. The first 75 pages of Rwanda’s Post Hearing Brief are largely devoted to
an analysis of the factual evidence given at the Hearing. Rwanda then submits that the

Tribunal has no need to assess the merits of the claim but that it should, in the light of the

Sl Resp. Rej., para. 416, citing Rusoro Mining Limited v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case

© BIT, RFA Exhibit 05, Art. 28(4)(c) reads: “/n deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall assume

thereof) [...]”.

evidence given, determine the arbitration in favour of Rwanda on grounds of want of

jurisdiction alone.

The Tribunal does not propose to follow this approach. The object of the Hearing was to
resolve issues both of merits and jurisdiction. The Tribunal proposes to make findings in

relation to both.

The grounds relied upon by the Claimants in support of their assertion that the Tribunal
has jurisdiction ratione temporae raise issues of fact that span the period 2012 to 2016. In
these circumstances, the Tribunal proposes to defer further findings in respect of this head

of the jurisdictional challenge until after it has addressed the merits.
LACK OF JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE

The Tribunal questions whether this heading is appropriate to cover the matters that
Rwanda has raised under it. They would, perhaps, have been more appropriately raised
under the heading of lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae. Under this head of challenge,
Rwanda has submitted that neither of the Claimants has suffered any loss. The Tribunal
proposes to address that submission when considering the challenge ratione materiae. At
this stage, the Tribunal will address the challenge made by Rwanda that is confined to
BVG’s locus standi. This is, in effect, that BVG has not demonstrated that it had any

material investment in Rwanda.
qd) The Claimants’ Case
a. BVG acquired an interest in NRD
The Claimants’ primary case is that BVG invested in Rwanda by acquiring an interest in
NRD.

The original Request for Arbitration alleged:

In December 2010, BVG and NRD’s ultimate parent company
signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of NRD’s parent
to The Spalena Company LLC, a wholly-owned entity of BVG
investors. As part of the purchase of NRD’s parent, BVG acquired
NRD and thereby obtained and held the beneficial interest in each

36

of the Acquisition Contracts for the Rutsiro, Sebeya, Giciye, Mara,
and Nemba Concessions.

151. In the Amended Request for Arbitration, the words that the Tribunal has placed in bold

type were altered so as to read “BVG investors acquired”.

152. The Tribunal refers to the facts set out at paragraphs 83 to 87 above. In their Memorial, the

Claimants allege that on 23 December 2010, Starck sold all of its interest in NRD’s Holding

Company, HC Starck Resources GmbH, to Spalena for Po

i: The following extracts from the Memorial address the basis upon which BVG

is alleged to have acquired an interest in NRD:

7. Roderick Marshall formed BVG to invest in Rwanda’s
mining sector. [...] Mr. Marshall, as the lead investor in
BVG, invested in Rwanda on behalf of BVG and obtained a
mining contract from Rwanda. [...] Unfortunately, [...]
Rwanda [...] took BVG’s concession in 2012. Despite this,
Mr. Marshall desired to continue investing and operating in
Rwanda and transferred BVG’s investments in Rwanda to
Spalena. As a result, BVG became an investor in Spalena.
Through Spalena, Mr Marshall, other investors, and BVG
invested in NRD. BVG and Spalena are commonly owned
affiliates.

[.]
10. Spalena is the primary owner and investor in NRD {...].°°

153. The Claimants’ Reply elaborates on this picture:

16. [...] BVG entered into a Cooperation Agreement with NRD
on November 1, 2010. [...] The Cooperation Agreement
provided that NRD would manage the operations of the
Bisesero Concession for BVG. [...]

17. [...] On December 23, 2010, Starck sold all of its interest in
HC Starck Resources GmbH to Spalena for

154. The Claimants’ Counter-Memorial contains more detailed allegations. BVG claims to have

acquisition of NRD’s shares by Spalena and also that it exercised ownership and control

over NRD indirectly through its ownership interest in Spalena.°* Details of these

In order to assist in the day-to-day operations of the Bisesero
Concession, BVG entered into a Cooperation Agreement
with NRD on November 1, 2010. [...] The Cooperation
Agreement provided that NRD would manage the operations
of the Bisesero Concession for BVG. The Cooperation
Agreement further stated that BVG would loan NRD
$100,000 for the purchase of mining equipment to be used at
BVG’s concession. In return, BVG and NRD agreed to split
the profits generated from the Bisesero Concession evenly.

As a result,
BVG was able to significantly reduce_the pu °
D [...]. BVG’s write off its [sic]
created an equitable interest
investment in NRD.

In November 2011, Respondent expropriated the Bisesero
Concession from BVG. So as not to lose the value of the
assets that BVG invested to develop the Bisesero
Concession, BVG sold all of its assets, totaling USD
$2,252,502.00, to Spalena in exchange for an ownership
stake in Spalena. [...] Prior to this sale, BVG was not an

156.

157.

owner in Spalena. Through this transaction, BVG became a
member of Spalena and an indirect investor in NRD.

102. Mr. Marshall, as the sole director of BVG, worked as NRD’s
Managing Director on the ground in Rwanda, overseeing
day-to-day operations in order to protect BVG’s investment
in NRD held indirectly through Spalena. [...|°
These allegations are based, almost verbatim, on Mr. Marshall’s Second Witness

Statement, dated 16 August 2019.

A number of documents are relied upon by the Claimants in support of these allegations.
The first in time is a copy of the Cooperation Agreement. This bears the date 1 November
2010 and bears Mr. Marshall’s signature on behalf of BVG. It bears an apparent signature
“4.Ehlers”, followed by a slash and then the initials “TG”, on behalf of NRD.”° Typed at
the foot of the document is “Confirmed as of 30 March 2011”, beneath which is the

signature “Thomas Grey”.

The other documents include a matching pair of Resolutions (the “Matching
Resolutions”), each dated 27 March 2012. One is a Resolution signed by Mr. Marshall as
President and sole Director of BVG authorizing him to sell assets on “the attached asset
list’? to Spalena, thereby making BVG a part owner of Spalena in accordance with
Spalena’s Amended Articles.’! The other is a Resolution signed by Mr. Marshall as the
sole Director of Spalena authorizing him to purchase the self-same assets, thereby making
BVG a part owner of Spalena.’”” The same two lists of assets are attached to each
Resolution, the first totaling US$2,252,502 in value and the second, which does not appear
to duplicate any part of the first, totaling US$49,646.52.

b. BVG’s ‘loan’ to NRD

The Cooperation Agreement provided for BVG to pay to NRD US$100,000 to fund the

purchase of mining equipment. It is the Claimants’ case that this was a loan that constituted

an independent investment in Rwanda. The Claimants submit that this ‘loan’ had all the
elements of an investment, as demonstrated by the relevant jurisprudence. It was (1) a
commitment of capital; (2) with an expectation of gain or profit; and (3) a concurrent

assumption of risk. ”*

158. The ‘loan’ was to enable NRD to purchase equipment as part of a larger investment

operation, namely the development of mining concessions in Rwanda. +

(2) The Respondent’s Case

159. Rwanda submits that the case advanced by BVG in an attempt to demonstrate that it has
locus standi in this arbitration is a fiction. Not merely is it not supported by the evidence,

it is contrary to the evidence.

160. Rwanda submits that BVG’s claim to have contributed to the consideration paid to Starck
for the acquisition of NRD by writing off liability of i is not made out on
the evidence and is implausible.” It is contrary to the express terms of the Spalena
Purchase Contract between Spalena and Starck ”° and to the evidence of Mr. Ehlers, the
Managing Director of NRD at the time of the purchase, and of Mr. Sindayigaya, a Senior
Accountant at NRD.

161. As for the allegation that BVG purchased a shareholding in Spalena by selling its assets to
Spalena, Rwanda submits that the Matching Resolutions purporting to authorise this
transaction have been fabricated by the Claimants. ’’ Rwanda relies upon the fact that there
is no independent evidence that supports the transaction, when such evidence would be
available had it taken place. Mr. Sindayigaya, states that he had never seen the assets in

question on Bisesero’s sites.”

As for the alleged loan of US$100,000 by BVG to NRD under the terms of the Cooperation
Agreement, it is Rwanda’s case that this could not found jurisdiction on the part of the

Tribunal for a number of reasons:”
(ji the advance provided for in the Cooperation Agreement was not a loan;
(ii) there is no evidence that the advance was made; and

(iii) the advance has no, or no sufficient, connection with the claims advanced in this

arbitration.

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis
a. The 17 May Award

The Tribunal refers to paragraphs 105-106 above. On the Arbitrator’s findings, Starck
never acquired an interest in NRD. Were this correct it would follow that neither Claimant
acquired any interest in NRD from Starck and, in consequence, that neither Claimant has
locus standi to advance the claims that form the subject of this arbitration. Rwanda has
conceded that, while the Arbitrator’s findings might be binding as between the parties to
that arbitration, namely Mr. Benzinge and NRD, they have no effect more generally in rem.
Accordingly they provide no basis for challenging the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.*® The

Tribunal endorses that concession.

b. Documentary Evidence
The Cooperation Agreement is relevant inasmuch as the Claimants alleged that breach of
this led to a liability on the part of Starck to BVG of a. In its Rejoinder,
Rwanda did not admit the authenticity of the copy of the Cooperation Agreement originally

produced by the Claimants.*! The day before the Hearing, the Claimants produced an

earlier, and slightly different, version of this document, bearing the signature of

Mr. Ehlers. ©?

At the Hearing, Mr. Marshall was cross-examined at some length about the two documents.
He said that his recollection was that the Agreement was signed “in counterparts”. The
initials “7G” against the apparent signature of Mr. Ehlers in Exhibit C-121 were those of
Mr. Thomas Grey, the Operations Manager. He was not able to state why the two
documents differed or which one was binding. He said that he believed that Mr. Ehlers had
written the document to memorialize what had been happening between the two companies

from August/early September until he wanted it documented as of 1 November 2010.*°

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Rwanda accepts the authenticity of the two versions of this
Agreement but submits that neither version represents a genuine agreement as there was

no meeting of minds as to its terms. **

Whether or not these documents evidence a binding agreement their terms have some

significance. The C-122 version provides as follows:

[...] NRD and BVG agree to cooperate in the management of the
Bisesero Concession (the “Concession”) as follows:

I. [...] During the period of this agreement, NRD, as
represented by Mr. Anthony Ehlers, and under the direction
and instruction of BVG, shall manage the operations of the
Concession for BVG;

2. As part of doing due diligence and managing the
Concession, NRD will buy necessary artisan mining-support
equipment for BVG, including such items as shovels,
compressors and jack-hammers, etc. using money provided
by BVG and will also loan its own equipment to the artisans
in the Concession. NRD shall buy (using BVG money) or
loan enough artisan support equipment so that the artisans
in the Concession may generate the maximum possible
minerals. BVG will provide USD 100,000 for this purpose to
NRD, and NRD will keep proper financial accounts of the

transactions made on behalf of BVG and will confirm with
Roderick Marshall prior to making such purchase;

3. NRD shall loan its bulldozer, wheel loader and tipper trucks
to renovate / upgrade / create the Bigugu site, and at other
sites in the Concession and for other purposes. Such NRD
equipment and machinery shall be provided for such period
as shall be determined by BVG. The cost of this operation
such as equipment relocation costs, direct operating costs,
fuels and oils, spares etc. will be treated as per Clause 5
below. NRD will loan enough machinery and equipment for
minerals to be processed on site in Bigugu and at other sites;

4. NRD, under the direction of BVG, shall create the same or
similar program of cooperative artisanal miners,
supervisors and security in the Concession as it has in the
concessions operated by NRD elsewhere in Rwanda;

5. NRD and BVG will together split the cost of agreed expenses
for production for the minerals from the Concession and
also from the net profit from the sale of such purchased
minerals 50-50;

7. This Agreement shall be effective for five months from the
date hereof and may be extended by the parties for one year
and may be made part of a permanent agreement if agreed
by the parties;
[..]
168. The Spalena Purchase Contract in respect of the Holding Company of NRD is a formal
contract in German and English, recording that it is negotiated in Hanover on 23 December
2010. It is signed by Mr. Marshall on behalf of Spalena and Dr. Jens Grunert on behalf of

Starck, as sole shareholder of the Holding Company of NRD. It states at Clause 2(1) that

the purchase price is a.

that

other than tax liabilities to the Rwandan State [...] and loans from
the majority-shareholder of NRD (H.C. Starck Resources GmbH),
the total liabilities of NRD of any kind are less than USD100,000.*°

Clause 3(n) states that to the best knowledge of the seller and the managing director of the

seller, the above-referenced statement is correct.

c. Witness Evidence

Mr. Ehlers’ First Witness Statement is dated 20 May 2019. It states that he has lifelong
experience as a mining engineer; he was appointed, and began working as, Managing
Director of NRD in mid-2010. Soon after this Starck decided to sell its shares in NRD.
Mr. Ehlers understood that this was because of allegations that Starck was involved in trade

in conflict minerals in the DRC, though not in relation to NRD’s concessions in Rwanda. *”

In around August or September 2010, Mr. Ehlers was approached “out [of] the blue” by
Mr. Marshall to enquire about the sale of NRD. Mr. Ehlers was not involved in the
negotiations that led to the subsequent sale, though he spent three weeks with Mr. Marshall

making sure that he acquired full knowledge of NRD, its assets and its operations. **

Mr. Ehlers commented that the purchase price of ii” was a very small sum relative

to the value of the equipment that NRD had but that it was obvious to both parties that the

business was very risky and would require very significant further investment. °°

Mr. Ehlers’ Second Witness Statement is dated 27 May 2020. He does not recollect seeing

the Cooperation Agreement. He states:

[...] When L first met Mr. Marshall in late 2010 and he expressed an
interest in purchasing NRD, we discussed a joint venture between
BVG and NRD in broad terms — Mr. Marshall wanted to use NRD’s
equipment to start mining operations at Bisesero. However, we did
not take any steps in this regard until after the Sale and Purchase
Agreement between NRD and Spalena was signed on 23 December
2010 and NRD did not ever receive 100,000 USD from BVG as set
out in paragraph 2 of the Cooperation Agreement.

NRD did not steal minerals from BVG’s Bisesero concession or use
the concession for smuggling from the DRC- that is an outlandish
and implausible lie. Based on what I saw when I visited Bisesero

around this time, there were no minerals being produced at BVG’s

Bisesero Concession to steal. [...]°°
In paragraphs 260 to 269 of the Claimants’ Reply, a series of serious allegations are made
against Mr. Ehlers in support of the allegation that he is biased against the Claimants. These
are largely based on letters written by Mr. Thomas Grey. Mr. Ehlers refutes these in detail
in paragraphs 24 to 33 of his Second Witness Statement. No direct evidence has been
tendered from Mr. Grey. Some of the allegations were repeated by Mr. Marshall when he

gave evidence. *!

Mr. Ehlers was cross-examined as to credit at some length, though it was not put to him
that the more serious of the allegations made against him were true. Most of the evidence
of fact that he gave was unchallenged. Mr. Ehlers responded to questions in a
straightforward manner. He accepted some instances of inappropriate behaviour on his part
and that on termination of his employment he had retained a laptop and other company
property in order to put pressure on the company to pay what he alleged were arrears of
salary. The Tribunal formed the impression that Mr. Ehlers was seeking to tell the truth
and that his evidence could be relied upon in relation to matters that he recollected. His
recollection was not, however, comprehensive as indicated by the fact that he did not

recollect signing the version of the Cooperation Agreement that bore his signature. °”

Mr. Sindayigaya stated in his First Witness Statement dated 21 May 2019 that he joined
NRD in January 2010 as Field Accountant and was promoted in early 2011 to Senior
Accountant. He left NRD in September 2012.°°

In his Second Witness Statement dated 27 May 2020, Mr. Sindayigaya commented on
aspects of the Claimants’ case on the locus standi of BVG. He stated that the alleged

liability of NRD for violation of the Cooperation Agreement could not have existed. ** No

minerals were being produced at Bisesero in 2010, nor would there have been any minerals
stored there. He had himself visited Bisesero in March or April 2011 and the only activity
that had been happening was the opening of a clinic. °° NRD would have had to have stolen
15 to 30 tonnes to have accumulated a liability to BVG of but not even one

tonne was produced in 2010.°°

Mr. Sindayigaya also commented on the assets to an alleged value of US$2,252,502 alleged
to have been transferred to Spalena in exchange for an ownership stake in that Company.
In several visits to the two mining sites at Bisesero he had not seen any of the assets
allegedly transferred.°” Serious allegations of theft and other misconduct were made
against Mr. Sindayigaya in the Claimants’ Reply,®* but these were not put to him in cross-

examination. The Tribunal formed the view that he was a careful and truthful witness.

Mr. Marshall was strenuously cross-examined in relation to all aspects of the Claimants’
case on the standing of BVG. He said that the Cooperation Agreement took effect in mid-
September, but was not documented until 1 November 2010.*° He insisted that the
US$100,000 had been advanced by BVG to NRD. When asked how it had been advanced
he stated initially that he did not recall, but he was sure that it was advanced. Then he said
that the advance had been delayed by a week and that he had had a “spat” with Mr. Ehlers

about this. Then he said the sum had been paid by instalments as NRD needed it.!”

He stated that minerals had been stored at Bisesero from 2007 and had a value of US$1-2
million. They had been stolen, possibly by Mr. Ehlers or Mr. Sindayigaya. '°! Mr. Ehlers’
statement in relation to NRD’s liabilities, annexed to the Spalena Purchase Contract, was

When asked why the Claimants had been unable to produce any documents evidencing the
sale by BVG to Spalena of the equipment annexed to the two Matching Resolutions,
Mr. Marshall replied that Rwanda had seized all of NRD’s documents other than those that
were kept in a different place — his apartment, to which he would often take documents

home. !°3

Mr. Marshall was insistent that at least some of the equipment listed in the annexes to the
two Matching Resolutions were at Bisesero. Mr. Sindayigaya was not correct to state that

none of the trucks or heavy mining equipment was there. !*

When asked why the Claimants had not produced contemporary documents that evidenced
his oral evidence, Mr. Marshall’s response was that Rwanda had seized all of NRD’s

documents. !°5

d. Conclusions

It is now common ground that the two versions of the Cooperation Agreement are authentic
documents. Neither Mr. Marshall nor Mr. Ehlers was able to give a coherent explanation
about these documents. Why there are two documents in differing terms has not been
explained. Nor has it been explained why C-122 concludes with the statement, signed by

Mr. Thomas Grey, “Confirmed as of 30 March 2011”.

The Tribunal finds that, prior to 1 November 2010, there were negotiations between BVG,
through Mr. Marshall, and NRD, which led to a joint venture agreement between the two
companies under which NRD would take over the running of the Bisesero Concession on
behalf of BVG, the owner of that Concession, essentially on the terms common to the two

versions of the Cooperation Agreement.

Mr. Marshall then decided to attempt to buy out Starck and acquire the ownership of NRD.
In this he succeeded, on terms of the Spalena Purchase Contract, signed on 23 December

2010.

It would have been logical for the acquisition of NRD to have been by BVG. For reasons
that are not clear this was not possible, so Mr. Marshall used Spalena, another investment
vehicle that he had formed, to purchase the Company. According to Mr. Marshall the

shareholders in BVG and Spalena were the same.

At this point the joint venture agreement between BVG and NRD became an agreement
between companies in the same group, with the same ultimate beneficial owners, and under

the control of Mr. Marshall.

The Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ case that BVG contributed part of the consideration
provided to Starck for the purchase by Spalena of H.C. Starck Resources GmbH, NRD’s
Holding Company, by writing off a liability on the part of Stark for iii in respect

of breaches of the joint venture agreement (“the write-off”), for the following reasons:
(ji No mention is made of the write-off in the Spalena Purchase Contract;

(ii) | The write-off is not consistent with the statement of Mr. Ehlers, annexed to the

Spalena Purchase Contract;

(iii) | The write-off is inconsistent with the evidence of Mr. Ehlers and Mr. Sindayigaya,

which the Tribunal accepts; and

(iv) _ The alleged breaches of the joint venture agreement, including the theft of ore to a

value of i. are not credible, for the following reasons:

(a) It is not credible that BVG had, since 2007, been accumulating, rather than

marketing, ore extracted on the Bisesero Concession;

(b) The production (if any) of ore at Bisesero between the date when the joint

venture agreement was implemented, even if this was in September 2010,

48

191.

192.

and the purchase by Spalena of NRD was insufficient to have a value of

(c) It is not credible that, if the alleged theft had taken place, there would be no
contemporary documents evidencing that fact. The Tribunal does not accept
that the Claimants have been unable to produce such documents because

their documents have been seized by Rwanda; and

(d) It is not credible that, if the write-off had constituted part of the
consideration for the purchase from Starck by Spalena of NRD’s Holding
Company, no mention would have made of this in Mr. Marshall’s First

Witness Statement.

The Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ case that BVG made an investment in NRD that is
relevant to this arbitration by advancing a loan to NRD of US$100,000 pursuant to the joint

venture agreement/Cooperation Agreement, for the following reasons:

(ji Clause 2 of the Cooperation Agreement did not provide for the making of a loan to
NRD by BVG. It provided for the provision of finance to NRD to enable mining-
support equipment to be purchased by NRD “for BVG”;

(ii) | The equipment was to be used in the Bisesero Concession, not in the Five

Concessions that are the subject matter of this arbitration;
(iii) | No documents have been produced evidencing that the advance was made;

(iv) | Mr. Marshall’s evidence in relation to the alleged advance was confused and

inconsistent; and

(v) It is Mr. Ehlers evidence, which the Tribunal accepts, that this advance was not

made.

The Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ case that, on the termination of BVG’s interest in the
Bisesero Concession, equipment owned by BVG to the value of US$2,252,502 was used

to purchase for BVG an interest in Spalena, for the following reasons:

49

193.

194.

(ji No document has been produced that evidences the alleged transaction;

(ii) It was Mr. Sindayigaya’s evidence, which the Tribunal accepts, that in several visits

to the two mining sites at Bisesero he did not see the alleged equipment;

(iii) | The Cooperation Agreement evidences the nature and the scale of equipment
required for operation of the Bisesero Concession — essentially support equipment
for the artisans working there. An agreement that such equipment owned by BVG
should be used to buy a share in Spalena would have required recovery of this
equipment from the artisan miners together with a valuation of such equipment as
could be recovered, followed by the appropriate documentary formalities to

complete the transaction. There is no evidence that any of this occurred;

(iv) | The Tribunal does not understand the object of such a transaction, as opposed to
simply permitting NRD to recover as much useful equipment as possible for use on

the Five Concessions; and

(v) The Claimants have not satisfied the Tribunal that the Matching Resolutions are
contemporaneous or that the attachments to these evidence a transfer of equipment
to Spalena. The schedules appear to be historic. The first of the schedules attached
to each Resolution values items at cost, where this exceeds their actual value. The
date of valuation is unspecified and some of the equipment is stated to be “in

transit”. The origin and nature of the second schedule is unclear.

The onus of proving that BVG has /ocus standi as an investor in respect of the investments
that form the subject of the claims in this arbitration lies on BVG. For the reasons given
BVG has failed to discharge that onus. The Tribunal finds that BVG has no standing to

claim in this Arbitration.

Henceforth in this Award, where the context so permits, the term “Claimants” will bear the

meaning “‘Spalena’”, as personified by its President and chief investor, Mr. Marshall.

The Tribunal has deferred for later consideration the question of whether the claims
brought by Spalena fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal ratione temporis. It now

turns to the challenge to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal over Spalena ratione materiae.

LACK OF JURISDICTIO! RESPECT OF SPALENA’S CLAIM RATIONE MATERIAE

 

qd) Introduction

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides, in relevant part:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute
arising directly out of an investment [...].

Article 1 of the BIT includes the following definitions:
“claimant” means an investor of a Party that is party to an
investment dispute with the other Party.

“covered investment” means, with respect to a Party, an investment
in its territory of an investor of the other Party in existence as of the
date of entry into force of this Treaty or established, acquired, or
expanded thereafter.

]

 

‘investment” means every asset that an investor owns or controls,
directly or indirectly, that has the characteristic of an investment,
including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other
resources, the expectation of gain or profit, of the assumption of
risk. Forms that an investment may take include:

[J

(b) shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation
in an enterprise;

(e) turnkey, construction, management, production,
concession, revenue-sharing and other similar
contracts;

Sl

(g) licences, authorizations, permits, and similar
rights [...]
“investor of a Party” means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or
a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make, is
making, or has made an investment in the territory of the other
Party [...].!°°

198. Article 2 of the BIT provides, in relevant part:

1. This Treaty applies to measures adopted or maintained by a
Party relating to:

(a) investors of the other Party;
107

(b) covered investments; [...]

199. Article 24 of the BIT provides, in relevant part:

1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment
dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:

(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to
arbitration under this Section a claim

(i) that the respondent has breached

(A) an_ obligation under Articles 3
through 10, [...]

and
(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that
breach; and
(b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the
respondent that is a juridical person that the
claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may

submit to arbitration under this Section a claim

(i) that the respondent has breached

06 BIT, RFA Exhibit 05, Art. 1.
‘07 BIT, RFA Exhibit 05, Art. 2(1).

52

200. This Tribunal will not have jurisdiction unless Spalena is an “investor” and is claiming in
respect of Rwanda’s treatment of Spalena as an investor or of a “covered investment”

owned or controlled by Spalena. The onus is on Spalena to establish the existence of these

The U.S. investors who own BVG_ funded Spalena’s
acquisition of NVD’s parent company, thereby acquiring
ownership and control of NRD’s assets, including the mining
Concessions.

BVG and Spalena then capitalized and funded NRD’s
liabilities and expenses in order to develop and operate the
mining Concessions.

BVG and Spalena constitute investors of a party to the
BIT(...].

[...] Claimants invested in the acquisition of the NRD, and
all of NRD’s assets, including the Rutsiro, Mara, Sebeya,
Giciye, and Nemba Concession.

[...] NRD is the local operating company in Rwanda through
which Claimants have made their investments of money,
equipment and other assets in order to conduct mining
activity in Rwanda. Accordingly, NRD is a “covered
investment” under the terms of the BIT.

145. Additionally, and as contemplated in Article 1 of the BIT,
Claimants’ efforts to develop the Concessions fall under the
BIT definition of “investment” [...].1°°
On the basis of the Claimants’ averments set out above, it seems clear that it is Spalena’s
case that not only NRD but NRD’s assets, including Concession rights, constituted
“covered investments” directly or indirectly owned or controlled by Spalena. This would

seem to be confirmed by the assertion

Claimants argue that they do have a legal right to the assets of NRD
and the Concessions,

made at paragraph 30 of the Claimants’ Observations on the Request for Bifurcation.

Rwanda advances detailed particulars of its challenge to jurisdiction ratione materiae in
its Memorial, supported by a wealth of jurisprudence. The Claimants have not addressed
these detailed submissions. This appears to have been on the basis that the Tribunal’s
direction that this jurisdictional issue should be dealt with together with the merits |!
confirmed that the Claimants did not need to brief this issue further. '!' No such inference
could properly be drawn from the Tribunal’s direction. It is, however, the Claimants’ case
that, on the facts of this case, there is no room for doubt as to the existence of a covered

investment.

The Claimants have in their Reply claimed that, by purchasing NRD, they “inherited” the
investments made by the previous owners of NRD.!!? On this footing, the Claimants claim

credit for investment of US$17 million by the end of 2011.1!

109 Cl, Mem., paras. 137-139, 142-143, 144. It is also alleged (para. 144) that the Contract between NRD and the
Government of Rwanda constituted an “investment agreement” as defined by the BIT and an “investment
authorization”. No subsequent submission is made based on this averment and, accordingly, the Tribunal will make
no further reference to it.

(3) The Respondent’s Case

In its Memorial, Rwanda submits that neither NRD nor the Concessions were protected

investments under the BIT and the ICSID Treaty.

a. NRD

Rwanda argues that NRD did not have the “characteristics of an investment’. ICSID

tribunals have developed a set of cumulative criteria of an investment under which

[t]here must be: (i) a substantial contribution in money or other

assets, (ii) a certain duration, (iii) an element of risk, and (iv) a

contribution to the economic development of the host State. ''*
Rwanda submits that (i) and (iv) are not satisfied. The Claimants have not demonstrated
on what basis they can take credit for investment by previous owners of NRD. As for the
Claimants themselves, they have not demonstrated that they have made a substantial

contribution. The purchase of the shares in NRD’s parent could not, of itself, suffice. !'>

Nor did the Claimants’ alleged investments result in a substantial contribution to Rwanda’s
development. Contributions to development may be made in a number of ways beyond the
financial, such as paying tax, environmental protection, community engagement, health
and safety measures, investing in developing local expertise and contributing to

employment. The Claimants’ alleged investments fulfilled none of these requirements. |'°

b. The Concessions

As far as the Concessions are concerned, Rwanda submits that they are not investments of
the Claimants that are capable of being protected by the BIT. The Concessions were alleged
to be owned by NRD, not by the Claimants. In theory the Claimants might have been in a
position to advance a claim for the damage done to the value of their shareholding in NRD

as a result of expropriation of the Concessions, but no such claim has been advanced. |!”

(4) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Bilateral investment treaties have generated a significant body of jurisprudence on the
meaning of investment. These have covered a wide variety of instruments, rights or other
matters alleged to have constituted “investments”. In Salini v. Morocco, from which
Rwanda has derived the criteria set out at paragraph 206 above, the alleged investment was

a contract to build a road. Other alleged investments have consisted of

operations such as the purchase of promissory notes or the

provision of inspection services to assist the government in

determining applicable customs tariffs. !*
In this case, Rwanda challenges the status as an investment of a controlling interest, via the
Holding Company, in the Rwandan company NRD. This is an unusual challenge. Article 1
of the BIT includes “shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise”
as forms that an investment may take!!° and a shareholding in a company is a common

form of an investment covered by a bilateral investment treaty.

Rwanda makes the point that the price paid for the interest in NRD was modest and that

NRD did not make a substantial contribution to the economic development of Rwanda.

Similar points were considered by the tribunal in Phoenix v. Czech Republic, a decision
referred to the Tribunal by Rwanda. !”° This Tribunal has found the lucid analysis of the
tribunal in Phoenix of particular assistance as it deals with particular issues raised by

Rwanda in the present case.

In Phoenix, the claimants in that case purchased two Czech companies and, within a little
more than two months, had given notice of an investment dispute, alleging that these were
investments in respect of which there had been a denial of justice by the Czech Republic.
The business of the two companies involved trading in ferroalloys. At the time of their

acquisition both companies were in liquidation. Ultimately, the tribunal ruled that it had no

218.

jurisdiction because the acquisitions had not been made bona fide. The relevance of the
decision arises from the comments made by the tribunal when considering whether the two

companies constituted “investments” for the purposes of the relevant treaties.
The Phoenix tribunal began its analysis with the following comment:

In general, it is very easy to ascertain the existence of an investment:
for example, nobody would contest that the construction and
operation of a power plant is an investment. In this hypothesis, a
reference to the ordinary meaning of what constitutes an investment
is sufficient and no sophisticated analysis based on several criteria
is needed, |?!

That tribunal went on to comment that special circumstances might require investigation
of whether an apparent investment fell within the scope of the relevant treaties. This was,
indeed, the position in Phoenix. The tribunal found that there was no previous “case

holding that the acquisition of a local corporation is not an investment”. ‘>

The Phoenix tribunal considered the four criteria of an investment identified in Salini. It
observed that not all tribunals had accepted the fourth criterion, the contribution to the host

State’s development. It expressed its own view that

the contribution of an international investment to the development
of the host State is impossible to ascertain — the more so as there are
highly diverging views on what constitutes “development”. A less
ambitious approach should therefore be adopted, centered on the
contribution of an international investment to the economy of the
host State, [...].'°>

The Phoenix tribunal went on to propound its own test:

To summarize all the requirements for an investment to benefit from
the international protection of ICSID, the Tribunal considers that
the following six elements have to be taken into account:

1 —a contribution in money or other assets;
2—a certain duration;

21 Phoenix v. Czech Republic, RL-095, para. 79.
'22 Phoenix v. Czech Republic, RL-095, para. 123.
"23 Phoenix v. Czech Republic, RL-095, para. 85 [emphasis in original].

57

3 —an element of risk;

4 —an operation made in order to develop an economic activity in
the host State;

5 — assets invested in accordance with the law of the host State;

6 — assets invested bona fide. '*4

219. The claimants in Phoenix v. Czech Republic had paid US$334,500 for the two companies.

This led that tribunal to remark:

The Tribunal considers that the existence of a nominal price for the
acquisition of an investment raises necessarily some doubt about the
existence of an “investment” and requires an in depth inquiry into
the circumstances of the transaction at stake. If there is indeed a
real intent to develop economic activities on that basis, the existence
of a nominal price is not a bar to a finding that there exists an
investment. 15

220. The Phoenix tribunal added this comment in respect of its own criterion No. 4:

The fact that an investment is not profitable cannot disqualify an
economic operation as an investment from the outset. The
development of economic activities must have been foreseen or
intended, but need not necessarily be successful, especially when the
problems an investor faces in the development of its activities come
from the host State's actions. '°°
221. These several observations, which this Tribunal finds compelling, have particular
relevance having regard to the facts of this case. The Tribunal turns to those facts. Where
they are contentious the Tribunal proposes, for the purposes of argument, to adopt evidence

adduced by Rwanda. |?”

222. NRD was established for the specific purpose of participating in Rwanda’s own plans for
its economic development. These involved attracting outside investment in order to exploit
Rwanda’s mineral reserves. The original founders of NRD had proposed to invest US$39

million. They had failed to invest anything approaching this sum and had sold ownership

and control of NRD to Starck. Starck had invested further sums in NRD, but again these

fell far short of reaching the US$39 million originally proposed.

Nonetheless, by the time that Spalena acquired, indirectly, ownership of NRD, NRD had
contributed significantly to the economy of Rwanda, as reflected by a substantial tax

liability.

On 23 December 2010, Spalena acquired indirect ownership and control of NRD for a price
of only a. The Tribunal accepts the observation of the tribunal in Phoenix v.
Czech Republic that such a modest price raises a question as to whether the transaction was
bona fide. Rwanda has not, however, challenged the propriety of the transaction. The price

plainly reflected a desire by Starck to abandon involvement in mining in Rwanda.

It is not disputed that Spalena, as personified by Mr. Marshall, hoped that NRD would
obtain long-term licences for the Five Concessions, enabling Spalena to raise finance to
exploit those licences on the international money market. In this NRD was unsuccessful.
NRD continued to operate, albeit with poor returns, as a mining company, up to, at least,
19 May 2015 and remained in existence, and in Occupation of the Concessions, after that

date and after the Cut-off Date of 15 June 2015.

There is no evidence of any significant external funding being provided to NRD by or
through Spalena during this period. NRD’s costs were funded from the proceeds of the
mining carried on. The Tribunal does not consider that this detracts from the status of NRD

as an investment.

The Tribunal has concluded that NRD satisfied the six criteria of an investment identified
by the tribunal in Phoenix v. Czech Republic by way of refinement of the Salini criteria.
There was a contribution in money or other assets. Spalena aspired to a duration of NRD’s
activities of thirty years. The venture involved risk. The object of the venture was the
development of an economic activity in Rwanda. The assets were invested in accordance

with the law of Rwanda and they were invested bona fide.

Looking at the matter more broadly, NRD falls fairly and squarely within the natural

meaning of an “investment” in Rwanda.

59

a. The Concessions and Spalena’s Loss

229. Rwanda alleges, under the heading of jurisdiction ratione personae, that Salena had
suffered no loss. The nature of this allegation appears most clearly from the following

allegation in Rwanda’s Rejoinder:

[...] under Article 24 of the USA-Rwanda BIT, a claimant may only
submit a claim to arbitration if the respondent has breached an
obligation under the USA-Rwanda BIT and the claimant “has
incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that
breach”. 18

230. The Tribunal considers that this averment, if read literally, is misconceived. It is
tantamount to saying that under the BIT the Tribunal will only have jurisdiction to entertain

a claim if the claim is valid. Such a contention is nonsensical.
231. The Rejoinder elaborates Rwanda’s submission:

Any loss suffered by NRD would only result in loss for Spalena [...]
if Spalena [...] had and [was] said to have had [...] a diminution in
the value of [its] shares in NRD as a consequence, which has not
been pleaded. The Claimants instead seek damages by way of
compensation for an alleged expropriation of the Five Concession
Areas and lost profit incurred by NRD, and not damages on the basis
of diminution in the share value of NRD. The Claimants have not
alleged, nor provided any evidence of, a diminution of value of
Spalena’s [...] shareholding in NRD. '”°

232. In essence Rwanda’s point appears to be that Salena is advancing a claim under
Article 24.1(a) of the BIT that ought properly to be brought under Article 24.1(b). The

helpful Submission of the United States of America draws the distinction between the two.

The U.S.-Rwanda BIT provides two jurisdictional bases for
investors to bring claims against a Treaty Party: Articles 24.1 (a)
and 24.1(b). Articles 24.1(a) and 24.1(b) serve to address discrete
and non-overlapping types of injury. Where the investor seeks to
recover loss or damage that it incurred directly, it may bring a claim
under Article 24.1(a). However, where the alleged loss or damage
is to “an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that

238.

239,

the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly,” the investor’s
injury is only indirect. Such derivative claims must be brought, if at
all, under Article 24.1(b).'°°

A footnote is cited therein, to the effect that Article 24.1(b) creates a derivative right of
action, allowing an investor to claim for losses or damages suffered not directly by it, but

by a locally organized company that the investor owns or controls.

The original Request for Arbitration included NRD as a claimant. That was not appropriate

or acceptable to ICSID. As a Rwandan company, NRD had no standing ratione personae.

It may well be that the appropriate course that should then have been taken would have
been for Spalena to make a claim on behalf of NRD under Article 24.1(b) of the BIT.

Instead, Spalena has advanced a claim in its own right.

The essence of the claims brought in this arbitration is that NRD was wrongly deprived of
long-term mining licences over the Five Concessions. If made out, the consequent losses

caused directly to NRD will have been reflected in the value of the company’s shares.

This stage of the arbitration is only concerned with breach, not damages. The fact that
Spalena may have pleaded a claim to damages that it will be unable to make good does not,
in the view of the Tribunal, provide a ground for dismissing the claim on the grounds of

lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae.

For these reasons the Tribunal has concluded that Rwanda’s challenge to jurisdiction in

relation to Spalena’s claim ratione materiae is not made out and must be dismissed.
LACK OF JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF SPALENA’S CLAIM RATIONE VOLUNTATIS
The following provisions of the BIT are relevant:

Article 23: Consultation and Negotiations

In the event of an investment dispute, the claimant and the
respondent should initially seek to resolve the dispute through

130 USA Submission, para. 15 [emphasis in original].

61

240.

241.

242.

243.

consultation and negotiation, which may include the use of non-
binding, third-party procedures.

Article 24: Submission of a Claim to Arbitration
[...]

2. Atleast 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under
this Section, a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written
notice of its intention to submit the claim to arbitration (“notice of
intent”). The notice shall specify:

(a) the name and address of the claimant and, where a
claim is submitted on behalf of an enterprise, the
name, address and place of incorporation of the
enterprise;

(b) for each claim, the provision of this Treaty,
investment authorization, or investment agreement
alleged to have been breached and any other
relevant provisions;

() the legal and factual basis for each claim; and

(d) the relief sought and the appropriate amount of
damages claimed. '*'

It is Rwanda’s case that its agreement to arbitrate under the BIT was subject to compliance
with these conditions (the “Conditions”) and that there has been no compliance. It follows

that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the dispute.

Spalena denies that the Conditions had to be satisfied as a pre-condition to jurisdiction but

avers that, in any event, they were satisfied.

At the heart of this dispute is the fact that the notice of intent dated 12 April 2017, upon
which the Claimants have relied as satisfying Article 24.2, identified NRD and BVG as the

intended claimants without mention of Spalena. !*7

Rwanda has not alleged that failure to comply with the above conditions caused it any

prejudice. It would be unfortunate if an arbitration that has progressed over a period of over

244,

three years should be determined on an issue such as this, which is one of form rather than
substance. Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided to defer further consideration of this

ground of objection to jurisdiction until after determination of the other issues before it.
LIABILITY

THE ISSUES

The Tribunal will consider the following issues that arise in relation to liability:

qd) What is the true construction and effect of the Contract?

(2) Did NRD acquire a right to long-term licences under the Contract?

(3) Was the 2010 Application for short-term or long-term licences?

(4) Did Spalena purchase NRD in the legitimate expectation that it would receive long-

term licences?

(5) After the acquisition of NRD by Spalena, did Rwanda give Spalena a legitimate

expectation that NRD would be granted long-term licences?

(6) Did Mr. Benzinge’s activities in August 2012 involve a breach of Rwanda’s

obligations under the BIT?

(7) Did the suspension of mining in the western concession areas in September 2012

constitute a breach of Rwanda’s obligations under the BIT?

(8) Did seizures and sales of NRD’s property by the Court Bailiff in 2013 constitute a

breach of Rwanda’s obligations under the BIT?

(9) Did the denial of the issue of tags to NRD constitute a breach of Rwanda’s
obligations under the BIT?

(10) What rights over the Five Concessions did NRD enjoy and when?

(11) Did Rwanda expropriate any rights of NRD and, if so, when?

63

(12) | Did Rwanda carry on a campaign of creeping expropriation?

(13) Did Rwanda discriminate against the Claimants in favour of other investors in

breach of its obligations under Articles 3.1 and 4.1 of the BIT?

qd) What is the true construction and effect of the Contract?

245. The Contract between the Government of Rwanda and NRD, dated 24 November 2006, is

in both English and French. In its English version it provides, inter alia, as follows:

Article 1: Purpose of the contract

The Government of Rwanda authorizes Natural Resource

249,

After positive evaluation of the submitted feasibility study Natural
Resources Development Rwanda Limited will be granted the mining
concessions.

Article 8 provides that the Contract is governed by Rwandan laws. !**4

Expert evidence on Rwandan law was given on behalf of Rwanda by Mr. Richard Mugisha,
a member of the Rwanda Bar Association and founding senior partner of Trust Law
Chambers. The Tribunal is satisfied that he is well qualified to give evidence on Rwandan

law and that he gave his evidence carefully and with proper objectivity.

Evidence of Rwandan law was also given by Mr. Olivier Rwamasirabo, on behalf of the
Claimants. He is also a member of the Rwandan Bar Association, having been admitted on
24 October 2017 and is the Managing Partner of Legal Wise Chambers Ltd. He was not
tendered as an expert witness although he did not give any admissible evidence of fact. His
precise role is not clear to the Tribunal. It appears from his evidence that he has given
general advice to Mr. Marshall. !?> In the view of the Tribunal he appeared to be acting
more as an advocate than an impartial legal expert. In particular, he produced a Third
Witness Statement dated 13 March 2020 that expressed views favourable to the Claimants
on almost every issue in dispute, most of which depended critically on facts that were not
within his knowledge, but which he asserted were based on his analysis of the documents
and on conversations with Mr. Marshall. !*° The Tribunal has not been assisted by this

evidence.

Having said that, there was agreement between the two witnesses as to some important

aspects of the relevant law.

In his First Witness Statement, Mr. Rwamasirabo gave the following summary of the

effect of the Contract:

Rwandan law is such that once one party to a contract performs,
that party is entitled to the benefits owed to that party under the
contract. With respect to NRD, the Contract obligated it to

“[p]roceed immediately to the industrial exploitation” and to

perform other research and planning activities. Once NRD
complied with these obligations, the Contract prescribed that NRD
“will be granted the mining concessions.” In essence, the Contract
was an executory contract in which performance by NRD obligated
Rwanda to grant to NRD the long-term concessions. '37

Mr. Rwamasirabo added:

Under Rwanda administrative practice, it is commonly held that the

failure of one party to contest the other party’s performance under

the Contract is deemed to be an acknowledgement of performance.

Rwanda did not object to NRD’s performance under the terms of

Article 4 or Article 8 of the Contract. As a result, consistent with

Rwandan administrative practice, NRD’s performance is deemed to

be acknowledged. '°*
Mr. Mugisha in his First Expert Report agreed with the first passage of
Mr. Rwamasirabo’s evidence set out above.'°° He disagreed with the suggested

administrative practice, stating that this was contrary to Rwandan law. '#°

When giving evidence, Mr. Rwamasirabo agreed that NRD had to perform its obligations
under Article 2 of the Contract before it would be entitled to a grant of the mining
concessions. He also accepted that it was for the Government to decide whether the

feasibility study that NRD had to provide under Article 4 was satisfactory. !4!

When giving evidence, Mr. Mugisha confirmed his First Expert Report. He added that,
because the Contract did not have any criteria for the feasibility study, this was within the

absolute discretion of the Minister. !

The Tribunal accepts Mr. Mugisha’s evidence. Mr. Rwamasirabo’s alleged administrative

practice is contrary to Rwandan law. Nor, had he been adequately informed of the relevant

facts, could Mr. Rwamasirabo have suggested that there had been a tacit acceptance by

Rwanda that NRD had provided a satisfactory feasibility study.

When giving oral evidence, Mr. Marshall asserted that it was NRD, not Rwanda, that had
to be satisfied by the feasibility study. '*? The Tribunal notes that a similar assertion was
made by TINCO, another applicant for a long-term concession, in respect of a similar

provision. '##

In their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants urge the Tribunal to interpret Article 4 in

accordance with Mr. Marshall’s oral evidence. '5

The Tribunal appreciates the reasoning underlying this assertion. As the Claimants pointed
out it was supported by the evidence of Mr. Buyskes, the General Manager of Rutongo
Mines, a company in the TINCO group. '#° Whether mining in a particular Concession
would be feasible would seem a matter of greater concern to the contractor entering into a
long-term commitment than to Rwanda. Nonetheless the wording of the Contract is clear
and the Tribunal is satisfied that it provides that Rwanda must be satisfied with the

feasibility study before being obliged to issue a long-term licence.

Another issue between the Parties has been the nature and scope of NRD’s obligation under
Article 2.3 of the Contract to “proceed immediately to the industrial exploitation in all

given sites”.
In giving oral evidence, Mr. Marshall asserted that:

The common parlance in Rwanda for what they mean by industrial
exploitation is giving assistance to artisan miners. It will only be
that, and it will never be more..'47

He said that any additional support beyond a hammer and chisel, anything that moved away
from simple buckets and shovels and hammers, was industrialization. He gave examples

of bringing in jackhammers, generators and compressors to run the jackhammers. '#8

This evidence contrasts with an explanation given by Mr. Marshall in his Third Witness
Statement as to the meaning of “industrial exploitation”, which included bringing in
“additional heavy machinery, and build[ing] processing plants” thereby moving “beyond

artisanal mining”.\°

This explanation accorded with the explanation of industrial mining given by Mr. Ehlers

in his First Witness Statement:

Essentially, industrializing means moving away from heavy reliance

on artisanal miners employing basic tools such as shovels and pans,

and moving towards a more sophisticated form of mining operation.

What is required to industrialise will vary depending on the nature

of the site and the minerals present, but will usually involve using

plant equipment and/or providing the artisanal miners with

advanced mechanized extraction equipment. ‘°°
The Tribunal has concluded that “industrial exploitation” is not a term of art. The phrase
must be given its natural meaning in the context in which it was used. As to this, the
Tribunal accepts the evidence of Mr. Ehlers and finds this corroborated by Mr. Marshall
himself in his Third Witness Statement. The Tribunal does not consider that the phrase
bears a precise meaning. It is satisfied, however, that the phrase falls to be contrasted with
“artisanal mining’. It means extracting and processing ore by machine rather than by hand.

This will normally involve the construction of buildings and the installation of a permanent

plant.

The Tribunal considers that the terms of the Contract, which were in standard form,
evidence a degree of naivety on the part of the Rwandan Government. There was a lack of

the precision and detail that one would expect in contracts that were, or should have been,

48 Tr, Day 2, 33:6-34:12 and 84:22-85:3 (Marshall).

of very considerable commercial significance. Contractors were required to “proceed
immediately to the industrial exploitation in all given sites”. This was an imprecise
obligation that provided no yardstick for the degree of industrialization required or the time

frame in which it was to be provided.

Even more uncertain by way of contractual commitment was Rwanda’s agreement to grant
mining concessions, implicitly for long-terms, albeit that the Contract did not specify the
length of these, “after positive evaluation of the submitted feasibility study”. If this was to
constitute a binding contractual commitment there had to be some positive criteria by
which the feasibility study was to be judged. The Tribunal does not find it easy to identify

these criteria.

It seems likely that the Rwandan Government hoped that established international mining
companies would be attracted to invest large sums “wp front” in revolutionizing the mining
industry in the various concessions. But, as Mr. Marshall pointed out, mining companies
were unlikely to invest large sums in industrialization without a guarantee of long-term

concessions.

It is not clear how the Rwanda authorities were persuaded to grant a Four-Year Contract in
respect of no less than five concessions to the Zarnack brothers, who do not appear to have
had any mining experience. Perhaps their proposal, not in the event implemented, to invest
US$39 million was the reason. Perhaps Mr. Benzinge, whose role in 2006, and indeed

thereafter, is not clear to the Tribunal, was influential in obtaining the Contract.

 

If Rwanda’s expectations were optimistic, the same may be true of the expectations of
some of those who succeeding in obtaining four-year contracts on the same terms as NRD.
Mr. Marshall has stated that he understood that he was guaranteed long-term concessions.
In due course the Tribunal will consider whether this was a legitimate expectation. It
suspects that other entrepreneurs may have procured contracts in the expectation that these
would lead, at the end of the four years, to long-term concessions that would be susceptible

to profitable exploitation.

In the event, it is perhaps not surprising that, at the end of the four-year period, no long-
term concessions appear to have been granted by Rwanda. On 8 August 2011,

Mr. Kamanzi, the Minister of Natural Resources, wrote to the Minister of Justice:

After evaluation based on the progress reports submitted by
different companies, most of the reports did not fulfill the terms of
the contracts signed. '*!

(2) Did NRD acquire a right to long-term licences under the Contract?

It is the Claimants’ case that, before it was acquired by Spalena, NRD had satisfied its
obligations under Article 2 of the Contract and become entitled to the grant of long-term
licences in respect of the Five Concessions pursuant to Article 4 of the Contract. !*? It is
Rwanda’s case that NRD had not satisfied its obligations under Article 2. In particular,
NRD had not proceeded immediately to industrialise the sites of the Five Concessions, !*?
as required by Article 2.3 of the Contract, and there had been no adequate provision of
evaluation reports of reserves and a feasibility study, as required by Article 2.5 of the
Contract. '** Furthermore there had been no positive evaluation of a feasibility study, as
required by Article 4. In these circumstances NRD had no right to the grant of long-term

licences.

a. Article 2.3: Industrialisation

In support of their case on industrialization by NRD, the Claimants rely on the construction
of a processing plant at the Rutsiro Concession. '* They also rely on alleged upgrading of

the infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, at each of the Concessions. '*°

The Claimants are not in a position to adduce direct evidence of the activities of NRD prior
to its acquisition by Spalena. Rwanda has adduced a body of evidence that has not been

challenged.

Prof. Rupiya served as Chief Geologist of NRD from February 2008 to February 2012. In
his First Witness Statement he states that when he arrived at NRD it was obvious that very
little had been done to develop the Five Concession areas under the Zarnacks.!°’ Starck
invested about US$1 million to build a mechanized plant at Rutsiro (the “Rutsiro plant”)
to process wolframite scree. This was not operated, however, as this proved not to be

commercially viable as the scree contained insufficient wolframite. '**

Starck also made some “relatively small investments” at Nemba, repairing tunnels that had
been closed. Two crushers, three compressors and a grinder and some safety equipment
were also supplied. Prof. Rupiya described this as “a pretty low level of investment”.!* In

oral evidence he accepted that this was the “beginnings of industrialization for mining”!

No investment of any significance was made in respect of any of the other three
Concessions. By around mid-2010, Starck stopped providing any investment to NRD at

all, so that Mr. Ehlers was reduced to selling equipment in order to pay the miners. !°!

Mr. Ehlers confirmed this account in his First Witness Statement,!® as did
Mr. Sindayigaya in his First Witness Statement, '® on the basis of the knowledge that he
acquired after joining NRD in January 2010.

On 15 July 2009, Dr. Roethe, the Managing Director of NRD, wrote to Mr. Karega, the
Minister in Charge of Environment and Mines, seeking, unsuccessfully, a two year
extension of the Contract. '“t He commented on NRD’s performance during the first two
years of the Contract, when NRD was in the hands of Mr. Christoph Zarnack and his son

Jens:

Despite firm promises made by these gentlemen they had limited
funds and were lacking in expertise in exploration and in mining.
Therefore very little progress was made during the first two years
until H.C. Starck GmbH [...] took full control over the company in
late 2008 [...].

All in all we lost about two years to investigate the concessions

potential and to evaluate ore grades and reserves.
The 2010 Application contains some passages that throw further light on the question of
the extent of industrial exploitation carried on by NRD during the four-year period of the
Contract. The construction of the Rutsiro processing plant, which had just been
commissioned, was highlighted, '® but apart from this the Application makes it plain that

there had not been any significant industrialization.

Reference is made to the proposed investment of US$39,501,500 under the Zarnacks’
original business plan, together with a proposal to invest US$20 million in a “tungsten

mill”. These targets were stated to be

seriously flawed and inappropriate. [...]

Therefore, when H.C. Starck acquired the majority of NRD in 2008,
the focus of activities and investments changed from large and
unrealistic projects to supporting small scale artisanal mining in
multiple places, with an emphasis on increasing the standards of
safety in the workplace and protecting the environment. An
expenditure of RwF 7.602.990.247 is evidence of the commitment of
NRD to the development of a sustainable mining industry of Rwanda
and its people. \°°

In their Pre-Hearing Brief, reflecting their Reply, the Claimants comment that it remains
entirely unclear what is meant by the term “industrial exploitation”, but that by any
definition of the term the Claimants met that goal through, at a minimum, building a
mineral process plant. NRD also built roads and other facilities that were “necessary

precursors towards full-scale industrial mining”.'°"

Ultimately there seems little dispute as to the relevant facts. Nor, in the view of the
Tribunal, is there any room for doubt as to the conclusion to which these facts lead. Had
NRD, under the control of the Zarnacks, immediately embarked on constructing the
processing plant at Rutsiro, it would have been arguable that this satisfied the requirement,
in relation to that Concession, to proceed immediately to the industrial exploitation of the
site, even though the industrialization in question proved misconceived. But the required

immediacy was lacking. There was no significant industrialization of the other sites.

For these reasons the Tribunal finds that NRD failed to comply with its obligation under

Article 2.3 of the Contract.

b. Article 2.5: Evaluation Reports of Reserves

It is the Claimants’ case that the 2010 Application contained Evaluation Reports of
Reserves in the form of “reserve estimates and further plans to calculate reserves” that

satisfied NRD’s obligations under Article 2. 5 of the Contract. '°*

Page 9 of the 2010 Application is headed “Resource and Reserve Estimations”. Under this
heading are set out estimations of primary wolframite deposits of 18,400 tonnes
(provisional) and wolframite scree deposits of 187,000 tonnes at Rutsiro, and Nyakabingo

laterite deposits of 172,800 tonnes at Nemba. The following page continues:

Reserve Calculations 2011 to 2015: A number of projects and
deposits have been prioritized and earmarked for follow-up
investigations. If preliminary established potentials prove to be of
substance, the following reserve calculations will be carried
out: [...J.1

These were “detailed calculations” of specified deposits or reserves at Rutsiro, Nemba and

Nyatubindi.
Page 36 of the 2010 Application, under the heading “Exploration”, states:

During 2008 and 2009, NRD Rwanda conducted a comprehensive
sampling campaign over the concessions Rutsiro, Giciye and

'68 Cl, Mem., para. 42; Cl. Reply, para. 62.
69 2010 Application, C-035, p. 10.

73

Sebeya. A special focus area was Nyatubindi, located in southern
Giciye and Sebeya. The aim of the programme was to capture all
sites with a ial to host ially ic columb lit
and cassiterite resources, tabulate the results and prioritise the most
promising sites for a more detailed follow-up investigation.

A total of 115 samples were collected.

286. Mr. Evode Imena was, between October 2008 and May 2012, an Exploration Geologist
in the Geology and Mining Research Unit of the Rwanda Geology and Mines Authority.
In May 2012, he took up a position as Mining Geologist with the Geology and Mines
Department (“GMD”). From February 2013 until October 2016, he was Minister of State
in Charge of Mining in the Ministry of Natural Resources. In May 2012, he was asked to
review the 2010 Application. In his First Witness Statement, he stated that a major
weakness in the 2010 Application was that NRD had failed to carry out a sufficient
exploration of reserves. !”° They had not conducted any drilling and the sampling was very
superficial. It indicated what minerals were to be found in the Concession areas, but not

the quantities.

What we were expecting by this stage was a much more
comprehensive report from a recognised expert setting out a
professional and detailed study of the level of mineral reserves at
each site. However, the documents provided by NRD in the
November 2010 Application fell well short of this. '"!

287. In his evaluation of the 2010 Application, Mr. Imena commented:
NRD did only some significant preliminary exploration work, but

failed to realize the objective of delineating the resources and
evaluating the reserves. '”

288. The Claimants adduced no expert evidence to counter Mr. Imena’s evidence, nor did they

challenge it in cross-examination. In their Reply, the Claimants alleged that Mr. Imena’s

evidence was put in question by the fact that he had been arrested in 2017 on fraud

charges. '” These charges were, however, dismissed.

289. The Tribunal found Mr. Imena to be a truthful and impressive witness. His evidence that
NRD failed to carry out the evaluation of reserves required by Article 2.5 of the Contract
is corroborated by the contents of the 2010 Application themselves. It is plain from these
that only preliminary exploration rather than evaluation of reserves was carried out by NRD

during the four years covered by the contract.

ce. Article 2.5 and Article 4: Provision and evaluation of a Feasibility Study

290. The Claimants’ case on the provision of a feasibility study is set out in their Memorial:

..the [2010] Application undoubtedly fulfilled the request that a
feasibility study be conducted. The Application details the geology
of each of the five Concessions held by NRD, details the available
minerals and the production from 2007 through 2010. It then goes
on to describe the planned activity from 2011 to 2015. Without

ion, the Applicati i 1a” feasibility study” and
established that the Concessions were viable and likely to produce
wolfram, coltan and cassiterite. !"4

 

 

291. In his First Witness Statement, Mr. Gatare, currently the Chief Executive Officer of the
Rwanda Mines, Petroleum and Gas Board (“RMB”), gave a description of “detailed

feasibility study”:

[...] there is initial surveying to determine things like geology,
testing surface samples, checking slopes, and contours, and then a
second step which generally involves trenching to understand the

physics of the ssion and to ine the physical properties
of the rocks to verify their mineralisation. Then there is the further
step of picking samples from underground to test in a laboratory
using geochemical analysis. For this, multiple drillings must also
take place as part of this process. At the end, the company will have
an understanding of the mineral deposits, and volumes of reserves.
But that is not the end of it: they must also conduct a mine
development study of the best method of mining, comparing the cost
of given tools, to ascertain the cost and benefits associated with each
method, and what the overall profitability of the most cost-effective

294,

296.

method is. The feasibility study is then signed off by a qualified
expert who can verify that it is a comprehensive and reliable
feasibility study.‘

In his Second Witness Statement, Mr. Imena stated:

A feasibility study for an industrial mining project should be a

comprehensive and detailed document that contains, among other

things, the study of the geology, geophysical and geochemical maps,

the ore reserves as per standard definitions, the mineral reserves

models, geotechnical studies, studies on environment, studies on

infrastructure, studies on markets, the mine design based on the

mineral reserves models, the mine sections and mine plans, the

mining methods and extraction sequences, the ore handling

processes, the results of metallurgical tests, the process plant design

and flow sheet, the mine construction budget and schedule, the

production schedule, the capital and operating costs estimate, cash

flow study, the financial evaluation and risks analysis. ‘7°
As a matter of contractual interpretation, the Tribunal does not consider that the “feasibility
study” required by Article 2.5 of the Contract had to satisfy all the requirements described
respectively by Mr. Gatare and Mr. Imena. It considers, however, that the study clearly had
to demonstrate the “feasibility” from the technical, ecological and economic perspectives

of mining ores in the Concessions in question over a thirty-year period.

The material included in the 2010 Application signally failed to do this. Broadly speaking,
it set out proposals for further exploration that might, if effectively carried out, demonstrate

whether long-term mining in some, at least, of the Five Concessions was feasible.

The matter does not end there, however. Under Article 4, as interpreted by the Tribunal, it
was a condition of any contractual entitlement on the part of NRD to long-term licences

that the feasibility study should receive a positive evaluation from Rwanda.

On 2 August 2011, Mr. Kamanzi of the Ministry of Natural Resources wrote to NRD in
response to the 2010 Application stating that NRD had not fully executed Article 2 of the

Contract

"75 Gatare (1), para. 21.

as regards the presentation of the final report of reserves and

mining feasibility studies at the end of four years.'7”
Should the Tribunal be incorrect in its view that the 2010 Application does not contain
anything that can properly be called a “feasibility study”, it is satisfied that there was no

possibility of the content of the Application receiving a “positive evaluation” by Rwanda.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal finds that NRD failed to acquire a right to long-term
licences under the Contract. Whether those then in control of NRD believed that it had such

a right will be considered in the context of the next issue.

(3) Was the 2010 Application for short-term or long-term licences?

It is the Claimants’ case that, having become entitled under the Contract to long-term
licences in respect of the Five Concessions, the 2010 Application was made by NRD in
respect of such licences. It is Rwanda’s case that (i) NRD had not qualified for the grant of
long-term licences pursuant to the Contract; (ii) those managing NRD were aware of this;
and (iii) the 2010 Application was for five-year licences under the 2008 Mining Act to
replace the four-year licences or “special permits” that had been issued to NRD pursuant

to the Contract on 29 January 2007.

The Tribunal has already determined that NRD did not qualify for the grant of long-term

licences under the terms of the Contract at the time that its four-year term came to an end.

Prof. Rupiya, who was Chief Geologist at NRD at the time, describes in his First Witness
Statement how NRD, appreciating this to be the case, applied for new exploration and
small-scale mining licences within the Five Concession areas. NRD proposed to carry out
further exploratory work over the next five years and hoped that the Government would
grant five-year licences and that, at the end of these, NRD might be successful in obtaining
long-term thirty-year licences. He states that Mr. Marshall is wrong to assert that the 2010

Application was for thirty-year licences. '’8

301. Mr. Ehlers describes in his First Witness Statement the information that he gave to
Mr. Marshall at the time of the purchase of NRD’s Holding Company by Spalena. He
explained to Mr. Marshall that the exploration licences for the Five Concessions were due
to expire in January 2011 and that NRD had applied to renew these but expected that, if
renewals were granted, they would be for short rather than long terms because NRD had

not satisfied the requirements of the Contract. !”

302. Mr. Ehlers’ evidence is corroborated by the terms of the Spalena Purchase Contract itself.

Clause 4.4 records:

[...] In particular, the Buyer acknowledges that [...] there are issues
associated with the renewal of NRD Rwanda Ltd.’s_ mining
licences..'8°
303. Dr. Michael Biryabarema, the then Deputy Director General of the Rwanda Natural
Resources Authority (“RNRA”), carried out an assessment of the 2010 Application in

2011. This stated that NRD was applying for:

1 A continuation of mining and exploration works in the five
concessions;
2 Mara to be converted into a mining licence; no resource

evaluation report was provided for Mara;

3 For a number of small mining licences within the
concessions of Giciye, Rutsiro, Sebeya and Nemba. '*!

304. The most cogent evidence of the nature of the 2010 Application is to be found in the terms

of the Application itself. The Application is titled:

Application for the Renewal of Exploration Licences
Nemba, Rutsiro, Sebeya, Giciye, and Mara
and
Application for the Allocation of Mining Licences to NRD.

The 2010 Application seeks to

retain the concessions of Rutsiro, Giciye, and Sebeya as Exploration
Licences, albeit with a reduced areal extent [...,] to retain Nemba
as an Exploration Licence in its original size [... and] to convert the
current Licence of Mara from [an exploration and exploitation
licence] to a Mining Licence for cassiterite and coltan in its original
extent. |
The 2010 Application states that it is proposed to apply for a total of 10 Mining Licences

in parts of the Sebeya, Giciye and Rutsiro Concessions. !*

In respect of each of the Five Concessions, it is stated that the exploration and exploitation
permit is due to expire on 28 January 2011 and that applications for renewal have to be

submitted three months before the expiry date. '**

The 2010 Application includes a proposed Activity Plan for Research for the period
29 January 2011 to 28 January 2015 with a total budget of the equivalent of €382,000. '*°

These terms of the 2010 Application accord with the evidence of Prof. Rupiya and
Mr. Ehlers.

Article 14 of the 2008 Law provides for mining licences to be conferred by Ministerial
Order. Article 44 provides for the granting of a small mine exploitation licence to persons
in possession of a valid research licence. Article 45 provides that a small mine exploitation
licence should be valid for five years and that an application for the renewal of such a

licence should be submitted at least three months before its expiration date.

It is impossible to read the 2010 Application as being for long-term, thirty-year mining
licences. All of the information as to what NRD proposed to do under the licences that

were being sought related to the next five years. The clear inference was that NRD was

applying for short-term, five-year licences under the provisions of the 2008 Law, and the

Tribunal so finds.

Minister Kamanzi so understood the Application. In his letter of 2 August 2011, he noted

that:

[Y]ou applied for five year (5) licences for small mines within each

of the five concessions. The new status of the concessions will have

to be decided based on the work executed in the light of the contract

signed (exploration work and other commitments) and on the

provisions of the new mining law. We extend the operation of your

license for six (6) months from the day of receipt of this later [sic],

to allow us time to determine the future of these concessions. '*°
The documentary evidence suggests that it is possible that, some three years later, Rwandan
officials, and perhaps Mr. Imena himself, lost sight of the fact that the 2010 Application
had only been for five-year licences and accepted assertions made by Mr. Marshall that the

application had been for long-term licences. !8”

The Tribunal notes that Minister Kamanzi did not grant the short-term licences requested.
Instead, he extended the Five Special Permits that had been granted to NRD in 2007, before

the 2008 Law came into force.

Thus, the Contract reached the end of its four-year term without NRD having satisfied the
conditions that would have given rise to a right to long-term licences. Thereafter, it was of
no further effect. Mr. Rwamasirabo expressed the view in his Third Witness Statement that
every time that Rwanda extended, expressly or implicitly, the mining licences, it also
implicitly extended the Contract. '** The Tribunal accepts the evidence of Mr. Mugisha,

for the reasons that he gives, that this view is unsound. '*°

(4) Did Spalena purchase NRD in the legitimate expectation that it would receive
long-term licences?

The claim that Rwanda “eviscerated” the Claimants’ legitimate expectation that NRD

would be granted long-term licences '* vividly depicts what the Tribunal has identified as

Mr. Marshall’s belief that he has been unfairly treated. The Tribunal is able to accept that

Mr. Marshall became involved in mining in Rwanda in the hope of obtaining valuable long-

term mining concessions. The Tribunal turns to consider whether any expectations that

Mr. Marshall had that NRD would receive such concessions were “/egitimate”.

The doctrine of “/egitimate expectation” has been developed by English Courts and
adopted by some other common law jurisdictions as part of the growth of administrative
law over the last fifty years. Where an authorized agent of government has made a lawful
representation or undertaking, that an individual will receive a benefit the State may be

held bound to that representation in public law proceedings.
In its Submission, the USA submits:

The concept of “legitimate expectations” is not a component
element of “fair and equitable treatment” under customary
international law that gives rise to an independent host State
obligation. The United States is aware of no general and consistent
State practice and opinio juris establishing an obligation under the
minimum standard of treatment not to frustrate investors’
expectations; instead, something more is required. An investor may
develop its own expectations about the legal regime governing its
investment, but those expectations impose no obligations on the
State under the minimum standard of treatment. |?!

Prof. Zachary Douglas, in his work The International Law of Investment Claims remarks,

however:

Where there is no specific rule of decision to apply, which is
invariably the case in investment treaty arbitrations, the tribunal
should search for principles of law. For instance, a tribunal would
be on safer ground by making reference to the principle of estoppel
or legitimate expectations to give content to the fair and equitable

324.

standard of treatment rather than appealing to the policy of

achieving ‘greater economic cooperation’..'°*
In its Rejoinder, Rwanda accepts that Article 5 of the BIT can be infringed by a failure by
a State to satisfy the legitimate expectations of an investor provided that (i) failure to
comply with the expectations infringed the minimum standard of treatment required by
Article 5; (ii) the expectations were founded on a representation that was made or subsisted
at the time of the investment; (iii) the representation was reasonably relied upon by the

investor in making his investment. '*

The Tribunal endorses these propositions and adds that an expectation will not be
reasonable unless based on a representation that was lawful and was made by an official

who was authorized to make it.

The Tribunal turns to consider the various representations that the Claimants allege were

made before the purchase of NRD’s Holding Company by Spalena on 23 December 2010.

a. The understanding of the mining community in Rwanda

The Claimants’ Memorial alleges that:

It was well understood [...] that once an investor obtained a
contract for acquiring mining licences and a permit for mining, it
would obtain a long term licence from the Government.'°*
In the Claimants’ Reply, this understanding was said to be that a long-term licence was

“guaranteed”. !°°

As Rwanda submits, the understanding of the mining community in Rwanda could not, of
itself, found a “/egitimate expectation”.'°° Mr. Buyskes, a mining engineer who had
extensive experience of mining in Rwanda, to which country he returned in 2012, stated in

his Second Witness Statement that the general understanding of the mining community in

Rwanda was based upon “the policies and practices of the Government of Rwanda”. '°" He
said that the understanding was that the granting of long-germ licences to holders of Four-

Year Contracts would be “a formality”.

In December 2010, the Four-Year Contracts that had been granted under Rwanda’s policy
of privatization were reaching the end of their terms. None had resulted in the grant of
long-term licences. The alleged understanding of the mining community was contrary to
its experience. In any event, that understanding could not, of itself, found a legitimate
expectation on the part of the Claimants that NRD would be awarded long-term mining

rights.

b. Government representatives

In their Memorial, the Claimants allege that

Rwandan officials, on multiple occasions stated that the long term
licences were guaranteed. \°*

The only pleaded reference in support of this allegation in the period before December
2010 is toa letter from Dr. Biryabarema, Director of OGMR, to the Director of the National
Land Centre dated 20 July 2009. This stated that Four-Year Contracts were expected to be
converted into long-term concessions of 30 years “where there is success in defining
economic deposits”. !°° This falls short of suggesting that long-term concessions were

guaranteed and was, in any event, an internal communication.

In his Second Supplemental Witness Statement, Mr. Marshall states that Mr. Lambert
Mucyo, an employee of RIEPA, led him to believe that so long as a company obtained a
short-term licence and began investing, that company would be guaranteed to receive a

long-term licence. 7”

Mr. Marshall refers to an email from Mr. Mucyo dated 12 December 2006.7"! This
provided advice as to how to obtain a Four-Year Contract for the Bisesero Concession but
does not suggest that obtaining this would guarantee a long-term concession. Nor would

Mr. Mucyo have had authority to give such an assurance on behalf of Rwanda.

In summary, the Claimants have failed to prove that, prior to their acquisition of NRD, any
authorized Government official represented that long-term licences would be guaranteed
to any company that succeeded in obtaining a Four-Year Contract. Nor would such a
guarantee have been lawful, for it would have purported to abrogate the preconditions to

entitlement to long-term licences contained in the Four-Year Contracts themselves.

Paradoxically, the Claimants have sought to rely in support of their alleged legitimate
expectation on the wording of the Contract itself, inasmuch as Article 4 states that NRD
“will be granted the mining concessions” following the expiration of the Contract. But as
the Memorial goes on to recognize, it was only after compliance with its obligations under

the Contract that NRD would be entitled to the long-term licences. 7

For all these reasons the Tribunal finds that when Spalena acquired indirect ownership and
control of NRD in December 2010 the Claimants had no legitimate expectation that NRD

would be granted long-term licences.

(5) After the acquisition of NRD by Spalena did Rwanda give Spalena a
legitimate expectation that NRD would be granted long-term licences?

It is the Claimants’ case that, after Spalena had acquired indirect ownership and control of
NRD, Rwanda continued to give them a legitimate expectation that NRD would be granted
long-term licences over the Concessions, which expectation Rwanda ultimately dashed.
That case, if made good, might support the plea that Rwanda had failed to accord the
Claimants the minimum standard of treatment required under Article 5 of the BIT. Rwanda
denies that the Claimants were ever given a legitimate expectation that NRD would be

granted long-term licences.

a. Mr. Bidega

The Claimants’ alleged expectation that NRD would receive long-term licences was
attributed, in large measure, to the intervention of Mr. Dominique Bidega, whose Witness
Statement stated that he was from 2008 until 2012 Director of the Regulatory and
Supervision Unit of the Rwanda Geology and Mining Authority (“‘“OGMR”). In his
Witness Statement, as relied upon in the Claimants’ Reply, Mr. Bidega states that he
reviewed the 2010 Application “for long-term licences” submitted by NRD.?°? Both he
and his superiors considered that the work performed by NRD satisfied their obligations
under the Contract. As a result of the high quality of NRD’s work, Mr. Bidega provided
NRD with a copy of the agreement that Rwanda was using for concessions. He and his
team negotiated the terms of the agreement for several months with NRD. Once finalized,
it was submitted to Dr. Biryabarema, who approved the draft. It was then sent to the
Minister of Natural Resources, who reviewed and approved it and submitted it to

Cabinet. 24
In his Second Witness Statement, Mr. Marshall states:

Iwas confident that the Cabinet would approve the long term license
when Dominique Bidega and his bosses, Dr. Biryabarema and
Minister Kamanzi, submitted the long term license to the Cabinet of
the Government of Rwanda for approval. ?°°

The Claimants’ Reply alleges that NRD

continu[ed] to perform under the Contract as it understood it was
required to do in order to receive the long-term licences

but that the Cabinet neither accepted nor rejected the draft agreement. ?°°

On 20 May 2020, pursuant to a request from the Tribunal, the Claimants produced Exhibit

C-207, which consisted of correspondence, to which Mr. Marshall was party, between

NRD and Mr. Bidega. This is comprehensively analysed in Rwanda’s Rejoinder.”°” In the
circumstances that the Tribunal will shortly discuss it is not necessary to analyse the
documents making up C-207 in detail. When considered, together with C-114, they lead

to the following conclusions:

(ji C-114 is not a draft of a long-term licence agreement, but of a five-year small-scale

mining licence agreement;

(ii) C-114 was one of a series of draft five-year licence agreements originating from

NRD and submitted to Mr. Bidega for his review;

(iii) There is no indication that any draft agreement was submitted to Dr. Biryabarema,

or to anyone else, for approval.

Dr. Biryabarema’s Second Witness Statement at paragraphs 9 and 10 contains a root and
branch refutation of Mr. Bidega’s evidence. He states that every aspect of the account given

by Mr. Bidega is untrue.

Mr. Francis Gatare was, at the material time, PPS to the President of Rwanda and
subsequently became Chief Executive Officer of RMB and a member of the Cabinet. In
his Second Witness Statement, he states that he reviewed the Cabinet Records and confirms
that no application from NRD was submitted to Cabinet. He adds that any such submission
would first have had to have received ministerial approval. No application for long-term

licences by NRD was approved by MINIRENA. °°

Prof. Rupiya, in his Second Witness Statement, states that he first met Mr. Bidega in
January 2011 at a time when Prof. Rupiya was the main contact person between NRD and
OGMR. He retired early the following year. Before he retired neither Mr. Bidega nor
anyone else at OGMR discussed long-term licences with him. NRD had only applied for a
five-year renewal. Neither Mr. Bidega, nor anyone else at OGMR, told him that they had

agreed to grant NRD a five-year renewal. No one ever sent him a draft long-term licence

agreement. He would have been told had OGMR been willing to grant any kind of licence
to NRD.*”

Mr. Marshall was cross-examined at length about the role of Mr. Bidega.*!° Despite the
evidence to the contrary, which was put to him, he was adamant that Mr. Bidega’s Witness

Statement was correct:

I absolutely believed it. [...] I had been told he [Dr. Biryabarema]

had approved it and Minister Kamanzi had forwarded it with his

approval to the Cabinet. ?"!
Having regard to the stark conflict of evidence outlined above the Tribunal awaited
Mr. Bidega’s oral evidence with some interest. In the event, it did not last long.
Mr. Cowley, examining him in chief, asked him when he was employed by OGMR. He
replied until 2011 because he was tired and wanted to take a break. He was referred to an
email in Exhibit C-207 dated 13 December 2011; this was part of correspondence with
Mr. Marshall about drafting of part of an agreement. Mr. Cowley asked him whether he
was still employed with OGMR on that date. He replied that he was not. He had resigned
because he was tired. Mr. Cowley asked him whether he had had conversations with
Mr. Marshall about a draft contract attached to the email. He replied that he had.
Mr. Cowley asked whether conversations with Mr. Marshall about a draft contract for a

licence began when he was still employed by OGMR. He replied “No”. ?!?

Mr. Cowley asked no further questions and Mr. Hill, for Rwanda, did not cross-examine.

Mr. Bidega’s answers to Mr. Cowley’s questions undermined the evidence in his Witness

Statement. That statement, in the English language, ended with the customary statement:

Ihave prepared this witness statement with the assistance of counsel
for the Claimants but the information contained herein is true and
accurate to the best of my knowledge. ?"3

It was signed at Kigali on 16 August 2019.

After Mr. Bidega’s evidence, the Tribunal invited Mr. Cowley to explain the process by
which statements of foreign language witnesses, such as Mr. Bidega, were produced in
English. He answered this question in relation to the Witness Statement of Mr. Bidega. He
said that drafts were sent to Mr. Rwamasirabo in Kigali, who engaged a translator. When
asked to confirm that the drafts were prepared on the basis of discussions that counsel had

with the witness, he answered:

I wasn't involved in the discussion but I believe the discussions were

aided by Mr. Olivier Rwamasirabo connecting us so that we could

talk, and being present to answer questions about what words

meant. But the idea was that we would send what we understood he

said to him in a draft, it would be translated, and we waited to get

[it] back. 2!4
The Tribunal accepts that Mr. Cowley was not himself involved in the discussions that led
to the drafting of Mr. Bidega’s Witness Statement. The account given by Mr. Bidega in
that Statement was in conflict, not only with his brief oral evidence, but with both the
relevant documentary evidence and the evidence of Dr. Biryabarema, Mr. Gatare and
Prof. Rupiya, which evidence the Tribunal accepts. The Tribunal finds it hard to accept
that the inaccuracies in Mr. Bidega’s Statement were attributable to bona fide errors in
translation. Precisely how and why Mr. Bidega gave the evidence in his Witness Statement

remains a mystery.

In its Post-Hearing, Brief Rwanda deals briefly with Mr. Bidega’s role, submitting that any
assistance that he gave related to the drafting of an application for a five-year licence was
given in a personal capacity, but that his Witness Statement was entirely undermined by

his oral testimony. 7!

In contrast, the Claimants devote seven pages of their Post-Hearing Brief to supporting
Mr. Bidega’s Witness Statement. ?!° The Tribunal is invited to disregard Mr. Bidega’s oral

evidence as “incorrect” and accept that the reality was that:

Mr. Bidega was authorized to negotiate a long term license with

Claimants for all five Concessions, those negotiations were both

known and authorized within the RNRA and the Ministry when they

occurred, and Claimants reasonably relied on those negotiations

with Mr. Bidega to justify their legitimate expectations of a long

term license."
For the reasons given, the Tribunal rejects these submissions. Nothing said or conveyed by
Mr. Bidega was capable of giving rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the
Claimants that NRD would be granted long-term licences in relation to the Five

Concessions, or any of them.

b. Statements by other agents of Rwanda

It is the Claimants’ case that their legitimate expectation that NRD would receive long-
term mining licences persisted until 2016. In relation to that assertion it is relevant to

consider statements made on behalf of Rwanda up to that year.

The response of Minister Kamanzi, dated 2 August 2011, to the 2010 Application is set out
at paragraph 312 above. That is explicitly a response to an application for five-year licences
for small mines. It extends the existing licences, granted in 2007, for six months to enable
consideration of the future of the concessions. The Claimants’ Memorial asserts that this
response acknowledged NRD’s compliance with the terms of the Contract.?!* On the
contrary, both the 2010 Application and Minister Kamanzi’s response were inconsistent
with an expectation on the part of the Claimants that NRD was entitled to and would be

granted long-term licences in respects of the Five Concessions. *!?

Minister Kamanzi sent this letter to the Minister of Justice, together with responses that he
had made to other applicants who had held Four-Year Contracts but not satisfied the
conditions in those Contracts for the grant of long-term licences. 2° Rwanda’s initial plan
for privatization of mining had not been a success and its Government had to reconsider

the basis on which long-term privatization would be effected.

On 12 December 2011, representatives of NRD, including Mr. Marshall, and of RNRA,
including Dr. Biryabarema, met to discuss a new contract with NRD, as evidenced by a
letter from Minister Kamanzi to Mr. Marshall dated 26 January 2012.7?! That letter
repeated the assertion that the resources evaluation accomplished under the Contract fell
far short of the level expected. In view of this, NRD was invited to negotiate an agreement
in respect of two of the Five Concessions. If this was not acceptable NRD should vacate
all Five Concessions. This was plainly in conflict with any expectation that NRD would

receive long-term licences in relation to all Five Concessions.

Mr. Marshall wrote back on 31 January 2012, challenging the accuracy of the Minister’s

account of the meeting. ???

Notwithstanding this letter, Minister Kamanzi wrote to NRD on 28 February 2012
extending NRD’s “special license” for three months, with effect from 2 February 2012.
The letter stated that the object of the exercise was to negotiate the terms of “the new

contract”. It continued:

I understand the absolute necessity to conclude this agreement as
soon as possible for strong investor confidence. [...] I am certain
that this is enough time for us to conclude a good contract for this
partnership.?>

The Claimants rely on this statement as reinforcing their expectation that NRD would

receive long-term licences. Had the negotiations been in relation to long-term licences there

would have been force in this assertion. In the event the terms of the letter do not seem

appropriate to what has gone before.

In the view of the Tribunal, this letter is indicative of a degree of disorganization on the
part of Rwanda. NRD had been left in possession of the Five Concessions without any
licence after the previous six-month extension had expired on 2 February 2012. The letter
purported to regularize this retroactively. It would not surprise the Tribunal if Rwanda was

taking similar retroactive action in respect of other concession holders.

This impression is reinforced by the terms of the next letter from Minister Kamanzi to
NRD, dated 13 September 2012, over four months after the extended licences had expired.

This states:

In view of the ongoing work on reorganizing the mining sector

which will have a bearing on the new contracts that will be

negotiated as has been communicated to all the existing concession

holders, I have the pleasure to extend your license up to October

2012, to allow for the ongoing work to be completed. ?*+
It is impossible to read into this an assurance that NRD was about to be issued long-term
licences pursuant to the Contract, or at all. No further extensions were granted after the

expiry of the extended licence in October 2012.
On 30 January 2013, Mr. Marshall sent to Minister Kamanzi what he described as

an update of the amended application of [NRD] for a long-term

mining concession license. 225
He enclosed: (i) a copy of the 2010 Application, which he described as the original request
for a long-term mining licence; (ii) an update of NRD’s proposed Investment Plan, 9 pages
in length, and (iii) a draft long-term Concession Agreement. This was said to be on a
template provided by the Ministry, and the Claimants’ Reply alleges that these documents

were sent pursuant to a request from the GMD. 7°

Had this been the case, the request would plainly have been capable of giving rise to the
expectation of the possible grant of a long-term licence. However Rwanda denies that these
documents were requested by the GMD or that the draft contract was on a Ministry
template. The draft contract was in identical form to Exhibit C-114, with the significant
difference that, under Article 2, the “Rights” afforded by the draft were stated to be licences

for 30 years, rather than (in C-114) a small mine licence.

Mr. Imena stated in his Second Witness Statement that the drafts differed significantly from

the form that the Government used. 727

The Tribunal does not accept that these documents were requested by GMD. Had they

been, Mr. Marshall would have said so in his covering letter. Instead, this letter began:

This letter is to provide you with an update of the amended

application of [NRD] for a long-term mining concession license. 7
The evidence as a whole leaves the Tribunal in no doubt that Rwanda had no intention at
this stage, or indeed at any stage after the termination of the Four-Year Contract, of
granting NRD long-term mining licences. The documents sent on 30 January 2013 were

sent on the initiative of Mr. Marshall.

On 10 February 2013, in a letter primarily concerned with mining in the Western
Concessions, Dr. Biryabarema referred to being able to “proceed with negotiations on your

request for new contracts for the concessions” .?”°

On the assumption that this was a reference to Mr. Marshall’s letter of 30 January 2013,
this could have been read as accepting that the request related to long-term contracts. It
could not reasonably be read as conveying an assurance that such contracts would be

awarded.

On 2 April 2013, the RDB sent a letter addressed to Mr. Joachim Zarnack as Chairman of
NRD. This letter referred to the Contract, stating that it had expired in 2011 and NRD had

been operating on short-term extensions while both parties worked towards concluding a

comprehensive agreement. The letter continued:

As the Government of Rwanda has taken the decision to negotiate

license agreements separately for each mining site, we wish to

initiate negotiations with the Company for the issuance of a small

scale mine exploitation license for the Nemba site. Attached is an

initial draft of the small scale mining and exploitation licence

agreement for your review, as well as a due diligence questionnaire

to be completed by the Company.?*°
The draft agreement has not been put in evidence. At that time, under the provisions of the
2008 Law the duration of a small-scale mining licence was five years. Assuming that this
was reflected in the draft agreement the letter could not give rise to or support an

expectation of the receipt of a long-term licence.

Nonetheless, Mr. Marshall replied on 9 April 2013, noting that the term of the Contract
had indeed expired

without NRD receiving the agreed upon “Long Term License” and
we would like to express our appreciation that we can now discuss
that.?3!

With one exception, 7”

the Claimants have not alleged that, from this point on, Rwanda
made any representation that was capable of confirming or supporting an expectation on
the part of the Claimants that NRD would be granted long-term mining licences. Rather it
is the Claimants’ case that their legitimate expectation continued, notwithstanding
statements from Rwanda which, on their face, were inconsistent with such an expectation.

The more significant items of subsequent correspondence now follow.

On 30 October 2013, Mr. Marshall and other representatives of NRD attended a meeting
chaired by Mr. Imena, who had been in post as Minister in charge of Mining for some six

months. It is the Claimants’ case that Mr. Imena assured NRD that negotiation on the

language of the long-term licences would be resumed shortly. 7° Mr. Imena does not agree.
In his First Witness Statement he states that, based on what his Department had learned
from visiting the sites and reviewing the materials, NRD did not have the capacity to
develop all five Concessions and should focus on two areas. 7*4 Since that Statement was
made, the minutes of the 30 October meeting were found. **> These confirm the accuracy

of Mr. Imena’s recollection and the Tribunal accepts his evidence.

A further meeting between representatives of the Ministry and Mr. Marshall and other
representatives of NRD took place on 8 November 2013. The minutes of the meeting record
an impasse.”*° The Ministry was prepared to negotiate on concessions at Nemba and
Rutsiro. NRD wanted thirty-year licences for those two concessions coupled with ten-year
licences at the others or an indemnity in respect of investment losses in relation to them.

There were no further such meetings.

On 30 June 2014, the 2014 Law came into force. This introduced a more flexible regime
so far as the type and duration of licences was concerned. Under Article 11, a small-scale
mining licence would be valid for an initial period not exceeding 15 years and a large-scale

mining licence would be valid for a period not exceeding 25 years. 7°”

There was a degree of confusion as to whether the transitional provisions of that Law
conferred any rights on NRD. At all events, on 18 August 2014, Mr. Imena wrote to NRD
requesting NRD

to re-apply for the licences of some or all of the former mining areas.
The list of what is required in this application is attached to this
letter. Each concession is a separate entity and should be applied
for individually i.e. for Nemba, Giciye, Rutsiro, Mara and
Sebeya.>*

The list of requirements was attached as an annex to the letter.
375. In his First Witness Statement, Mr. Imena states:

Although we were under no obligation to do so, we decided to give
NRD a further opportunity to submit an application for long-term
licences which complied with the new legal framework. I was
determined that NRD should either make proper applications for
licences under the new 2014 Law, or cease operating as we could
not allow the situation to continue whereby it was operating
unlawfully.?°?

376. Six days before he sent the 18 August letter, Mr. Imena’s department had published an
assessment of NRD’s performance. This started by considering the performance by NRD
of its obligations under the Contract. It was highly critical of this. It identified significant
failures to satisfy the Contract and commented on the paucity of the money invested, a

substantial undeclared and unpaid liability to Rwandan tax and a “challenged environment

management record”, **°

377. Under the heading “APPLICATION FOR LONG-TERM LICENSE” the assessment appears
to have treated the 2010 Application as having been the initial application for long-term

licences. It made the following recommendation:

Since the Company has; (i) clearly failed to fulfill its main
contractual obligations (exploration and industrial production) and
hasn't demonstrated satisfactory managerial, financial and
technical competence; (ii) had poor Environment management and
failed in effective management of the concessions as shown by
rampant illegal activities; (iii) had poor labour relations
characterised by numerous disputes; (iv) displayed lack of
cooperation in reasonable negotiations, the concessions should
revert back to Government. Should the company be willing, it can
re-apply for any of the concessions. 7*!

On 16 September 2014, representatives of NRD met with Mr. Vincent Biruta, who had
recently been appointed Minister of Natural Resources. According to Mr. Marshall, he

promised:

[A]s long as I am Minister, you will not lose your Concessions. ***

This led Mr. Marshall to believe that the application for new licences was “a mere
243

formality”.

Mr. Imena stated that he did not believe that Minister Biruta could have said this. He had

a close working relationship with Minister Biruta, who shared his concerns about NRD.?#

Mr. Gatare stated that he discussed this allegation with Minister Biruta, who confirmed

that he gave no such assurance or promise. 7°

The Tribunal does not accept that Minister Biruta gave the alleged assurance. Having
regard to the adverse departmental appraisal of NRD’s performance it is inconceivable that
such an assurance would have been given. Mr. Marshall’s evidence was frequently

imaginative, and this is one such example.

On 18 September 2014, NRD made an application (the “2014 Application”) for long-term
licences under the 2014 Law. This was under cover of a letter that alleged that the Contract
was still in force, that NRD had complied with its obligations under it and invested funds
in excess of US$20 million and that the Government was bound to grant a “/ong term

license” of 35 years duration. 7°

Details of the 2014 Application are set out in a memorandum from the Licence Evaluation
Team dated 29 September 2014. This records that NRD had disregarded the list of what
was required that had been attached to Mr. Imena’s letter of 18 August. In effect, NRD was

relying on material in the 2010 Application to support an application for a thirty-five-year

licence covering all Five Concessions. The Team recommended that licences should not
be granted in respect of the Five Concessions but suggested options under which NRD

might be given seven days to appeal, or 30 days to provide the missing information. 74”

Mr. Imena adopted the former suggestion. On 28 October 2014, he wrote to NRD observing
that NRD had failed to provide all the requested documents and that those that had been
provided were unsatisfactory, with the consequence that the Ministry had decided not to
grant licences in respect of any of the Concessions. 7 days were given in which to appeal,

failing which NRD was instructed to hand over all mining concessions within 60 days. 7

This letter was manifestly inconsistent with any continued expectation that NRD would
receive long-term licences. It is the Claimants’ case that they nonetheless continued to hold

that expectation.

Mr. Marshall wrote on 1 November 2014, exercising NRD’s right of appeal. His letter
complained that NRD had received unequal and unfair treatment and suffered
victimization. It then asserted that NRD had a subsisting right to a long-term licence under
the Contract and asked for a start of negotiations as soon as possible in order to implement

this right. 74

Mr. Imena replied on 12 November 2014, stating that NRD had no subsisting right under
the Contract and that the 2014 Application had been refused in accordance with the 2014
Law; annexed to his letter was a schedule of the information requested in the annex to his
of 18 August. NRD was given 15 days to make good the deficiencies, so that its application

could be reconsidered. >?

NRD supplied some further information on 16 January 2016.?°

389. Thereafter NRD’s application was the subject of two assessment reports. The first, dated
26 January 2015, was prepared by two lawyers and Mr. Ntenge, the Director of Mineral
Research. 7+ The second assessment report was signed off by Dr. Michael Biryabarema
and dated February 2015. Dr. Biryabarema’s recommendations as set down in the latter

document were as follows:

— There is no basis for MINIRENA to grant a mining license to
NRD (Rwanda) Itd for the five ‘concessions’. Technically NRD
Ltd did not apply for any ‘concession’. It was clearly stated in
[Minister Imena]’s letter that each ‘concession’ should be
applied for as an entity. Secondly the documents submitted were
insufficient and not specific to any ‘concession’;

— The company has not shown any financial or technical viability
and is therefore not qualified to such a large and potential area.
If it had been cooperative, negotiations for one concession, say
Nemba, would be viable and reasonable;

— The company has publicly and on several occasions stated that
it has so far invested 20M US$ in the concessions. A look at the
list of expenditures includes huge payables without
documentation like a reported foreign consultant fees [sic] of
about 5 billion Frw. There might be need to request the Auditor
General’s Office to audit the finances of the company to stop it
from making any unsubstantiated claims{.]?>>

or to any other witness in cross-examination. 7°’ The Tribunal considers that this is a point

well made.

On 19 May 2015, Mr. Imena wrote to Mr. Marshall observing that for the third time NRD
had failed to submit complete application files. In these circumstances, the Ministry was
not able to grant mining licences for any of the Five Concessions. NRD was accordingly
requested to proceed with the closure of its operations and hand over the mining perimeters

of each of the Concessions within 60 days. ?**

This summary demonstrates that nothing said by other agents of Rwanda was capable of

giving rise to a legitimate expectation that long term licences would be issued to NRD.

c. The Military

In their Pre-Hearing Brief, the Claimants make, for the first time, detailed allegations in
relation to pro bono assistance provided over the years by Mr. Marshall and
Ms. Mruskovicova to the Rwandan military in a variety of different ways, none of which
had anything to do with mining. It is alleged that because of this Mr. Marshall was promised

that if he invested in a short-term mining licence a long-term licence was guaranteed. 7°

Rwanda challenges this allegation on the ground that it was not merely novel but in conflict
with the case previously advanced by the Claimants. Furthermore, for the military to have
sought to reward Mr. Marshall by obtaining for him preferential mining rights would have
been improper. 2° The Tribunal endorses this submission. No legitimate expectation could

be founded on improper promises from the military.

d. Summary

There are both subjective and objective elements in a legitimate expectation. Subjectively,

Party A, asserting a legitimate expectation, must establish that he had that expectation.

Objectively, Party B must be shown to have made a promise or representation that has

reasonably given rise to that expectation.

Anyone who signed a Four-Year Contract with Rwanda could assert that he had a
reasonable expectation that, if he complied with the obligations under the Contract and
produced a satisfactory feasibility study, he would be rewarded with a long-term licence.
Such an expectation flowed reasonably from the terms of the Contract agreed by Rwanda.
That is not, however, the expectation that the Claimants seek to establish. They submit that
they had a reasonable expectation that anyone who secured a Four-Year Contract would be
guaranteed a long-term licence. More particularly they submit that they had a reasonable

expectation that NRD would be granted long-term licences for the Five Concessions.

The Tribunal has held that NRD did not satisfy its obligations under its Four-Year Contract,
nor did it produce a feasibility study that Rwanda should have accepted as satisfactory. The
Tribunal has considered in some detail the history of relations between NRD, led by
Mr. Marshall and Rwanda. It has concluded that nothing said or done by anyone authorized
to act for Rwanda could, at any time, have given rise to a reasonable expectation that NRD

would be granted long-term mining licences for the Five Concessions, or for any of them.

(6) Did Mr. Benzinge’s activities in and after August 2012 involve a breach of
Rwanda’s obligations under the BIT?

a. August 2012

Mr. Ben Benzinge, a Rwandan national, had taken part in the founding of NRD in July
2006. He was allocated 15% of the shareholding in the Company, though Mr. Marshall
contended that he forfeited his right to these shares because he failed to pay for them. He
objected to the transfer of NRD from the Zarnacks to Sparck. From 2012 to 2014, he was

an intermittent thorn in the flesh of Mr. Marshall.

Mr. Benzinge did not feature prominently in the Claimants’ Memorial. This alleges that
Mr. Benzinge “convinced the RDB that he was the managing director” of NRD and that
RDB altered the Company Register to record this fact. After a week, RDB was persuaded
that Mr. Benzinge was not Managing Director, and the Register was rectified. During the

week that he was in office, Mr. Benzinge is alleged to have wreaked mayhem, taking

100

399.

401.

control of NRD’s offices, changing the locks on NRD’s buildings and offices and stealing
from the Concessions. ”°! It is not alleged that Rwanda was complicit in Mr. Benzinge’s
wrongdoing, merely that it facilitated this. However, in their Counter-Memorial, the

Claimants allege that Rwanda

by and through the RDB, used Benzinge as a pawn to make clear to
Claimants that they could be stripped of their entire investment on
a whim.?°

In their Pre-Hearing Brief, the Claimants allege:

Claimants could not have known it at the time, but this was one of
the first bad acts in a long line of bad acts perpetrated by
Respondent in an effort to force Claimants to abandon their
investment?
When Mr. Marshall gave oral evidence, he alleged that Mr. Benzinge had acted in collusion

with RDB.?

The Tribunal rejects this evidence. It is not merely unsupported by contemporary evidence
but in conflict with it and with the description of what occurred in the Claimants’ Memorial.
The speed with which the RDB rectified the Register is in obvious conflict with the

suggestion that they were acting in cahoots with Mr. Benzinge.

b. June to August 2014

In October 2012, Mr. Benzinge brought the arbitration proceedings against NRD in which,
inter alia, he challenged Mr. Marshall’s position as Managing Director of NRD and which
resulted in the award of 17 May 2013 (see paragraph 105 above). A challenge by NRD to

265

that 17 May Award was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 2 May 2014.

The Claimants’ Memorial alleges that Mr. Benzinge resumed his hostile activities over a
period of about two months starting in June 2014, falsely claiming to own 100% of the
shares in NRD and to be Managing Director and, with the assistance of the local police and
Bailiff Bosco, seizing NRD’s offices, buildings and assets. Complaint is made that
Mr. Benzinge, a Rwandan citizen, was receiving assistance from Ministers and others, to

the detriment of the Claimants, as foreign investors. 7°

In the Claimants’ Reply, it is alleged that from June through to August 2014 Mr. Imena
declared that Mr. Benzinge owned 100% of the shares in NRD and allowed Mr. Benzinge
to take control of NRD’s offices and concessions. 7°’ This allegation was repeated in the
Claimants’ Pre-Hearing Brief** and in Mr. Cowley’s opening submissions at the

Hearing. >

Mr. Hill, for Rwanda, described this episode involving Mr. Benzinge as a “sideshow or
smokescreen issue[ }’.?”° The Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief brought Mr. Benzinge onto

centre stage. It alleges:

the destructive role played by Mr. Benzinge was both furthered and
exploited by Respondent, who, in the end, has been unable to give a
coherent position concerning its actions in reaction to
Mr. Benzinge’s arbitration award.?’

No less than ten pages are then devoted to a speculative thesis, presaged nowhere in
evidence or submissions. Under this thesis, Mr. Imena is alleged initially to have relied on
the 17 May Award to recognise Mr. Benzinge as owner of NRD “in an effort to get
Claimants to give up and forfeit their Concessions”.*” Further, Mr. Imena intended to
continue to refuse to recognise Mr. Marshall as representing the owners and being in charge

of NRD until “Claimants collapsed and abandoned their investment”. ?” He reversed this

policy as a result of the intervention of the military, who were relying on the good offices
of Mr. Marshall to broker a deal between Rwanda, Slovakia and the Czech Republic in

relation to the sale and servicing of military equipment and training in the use of this.?”

As the Tribunal understands it, this conduct is alleged to have breached Rwanda’s duty
under Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the BIT, and constituted incidents in the “creeping

expropriation” that violated Article 6.

Had provision been made for responses to Post-Hearing Briefs, the Tribunal believes that
Rwanda would have protested against the submission by the Claimants of the novel case
described above. Such a protest would have been justified. Not only was the case novel, it

was not founded on evidence but on conjecture.

The nature and effect of the 17 May Award has been and remains an enigma as far as the
Tribunal is concerned. In the view of the Tribunal, the same is true of the Parties’ treatment
of the 17 May Award. Rwanda has chosen not to rely upon the 17 May Award, which
might have provided a very short answer to the Claimants’ assertions on jurisdiction. The
Claimants have alleged that the 17 May Award was wrong but have advanced no
submissions as to how this contention can be reconciled with the Judgment of the Supreme
Court upholding it. The enigma may be attributable to the fact that neither Mr. Marshall
nor anyone else representing NRD took part in the hearing. In these circumstances, the

Tribunal understands that no appeal could be made on the merits.

The 17 May Award provided Mr. Benzinge with the opportunity to make a plausible further
challenge in relation to the ownership of NRD and Mr. Marshall’s position as Managing

Director in particular.

Mr. Marshall’s allegation that Mr. Imena declared that Mr. Benzinge owned 100% of the
shares in NRD is undocumented and uncorroborated. In his First Witness Statement,
Mr. Imena said that he told Mr. Benzinge that they would only deal with the person who,

according to the RDB records, was the Managing Director and owner of NRD.?”> In his

Second Witness Statement, he stated that he was not willing to get involved in the dispute
as to NRD’s ownership and was not in a position to decide who was right and who was

wrong. He could not side with one party or the other. ?”°

In his Second Witness Statement, Mr. Imena categorically denies that he unilaterally
declared that Mr. Benzinge owned 100% of NRD.?”’ The Tribunal accepts Mr. Imena’s

evidence on this point.

In the event, on 19 August 2014, the Concessions were returned to Mr. Marshall’s control
and Mr. Benzinge was said to have fled the country.?’* A week later, on 26 August 2014,
Mr. Marshall wrote to Minister Busingye “to again express our appreciation for the return

of our business”.?”

This return renders the Claimants’ allegation that Rwanda was supporting Mr. Benzinge’s
take-over bid inherently implausible. In contrast, the Tribunal finds it entirely plausible
that Mr. Benzinge, armed with the 17 May Award and the decision of the Supreme Court
upholding it, was able to create over a period of two months real uncertainty as to who
owned and was entitled to manage NRD. Ultimately, in circumstances that are not entirely

clear on the evidence, that uncertainty was resolved in favour of Mr. Marshall.

The short answer to the allegations made in relation to Mr. Benzinge’s activities is given

in the Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief:

The actions of Mr. Benzinge were as a private individual (and not
of or attributable in any way to the RDB or any other State body).?*°

28! it was the Claimants’ case that

Before the more extreme submissions referred to above,
Mr. Benzinge’s activities were permitted as a result of a failure by Rwanda to accord to the

Claimants “full protection and security” as required by Article 5(1) of the BIT. Rwanda

addresses this submission in detail in paragraphs 402 to 408 of its Counter-Memorial. The
Tribunal accepts these submissions. On the facts no case is made out of a failure on the
part of Rwanda to satisfy the requisite international standard of provision of protection and

security in respect of Mr. Benzinge’s activities.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Benzinge’s activities on and after August

2012 did not involve a breach of Rwanda’s obligations under the BIT.

(7) Did the suspension of mining in the western concession area in September
2012 constitute a breach of Rwanda’s obligations under the BIT?

In their Memorial, the Claimants allege that they were treated unfairly and inequitably

when they were barred on two separate occasions in 2012 from accessing their Western

Concessions by local authorities who permitted local miners to continue mining in NRD’s

absence. 78?

In their Reply, they allege that tactics designed to “force Claimants to walk away” included

“indiscriminately ceasing Claimants’ mining operations” .?*°

In his First Witness Statement, Mr. Marshall states that Dr. Biryabarema ordered the
closure of NRD’s Western Concessions alleging that NRD’s mining activities were
resulting in environmental pollution. This allegation was untrue; NRD was not working
where the pollution was occurring. The pollution was attributable to poor agricultural
practices, run-off from historic mine workings, and illegal mining. Out of good will NRD
took a number of remedial measures. In July 2013, without addressing any environmental

issues, Dr. Biryabarema permitted the NRD Western Concessions to resume mining. 7**

Because the allegations were patently untrue and Dr. Biryabarema refused properly to look

into the matter, NRD concluded that he was merely following orders.

Dr. Biryabarema addresses these allegations in his Second Witness Statement by reference

to the letter that he wrote to Mr. Marshall on 10 February 2013. He explains that local

government had stopped NRD from mining at its Western Concessions due to concerns
about environmental damage and smuggling. This was pursuant to a local government
power to stop mining activities in the short-term if these were giving rise to concern.

Thereafter, it was for central Government to decide how to proceed. 7°

Mr. Marshall met with Dr. Biryabarema on 6 February 2013. He proposed that NRD should
curb the illegal mining that was causing pollution by employing demobilized soldiers.
Dr. Biryabarema accepted this proposal and, by his letter of 10 February, gave permission
to NRD to resume its activities in the short-term, pending resolution of the application that

NRD had made on 30 January 2013 for a long-term mining licence.

Dr. Biryabarema was not cross-examined in respect of this evidence when he gave oral

evidence.

The Tribunal accepts Dr. Biryabarema’s unchallenged explanation of this part of the story.
The suggestion that NRD was excluded from its Western Concessions while local miners
were permitted to continue mining is unsubstantiated. The concern of the local authorities
was with damage being caused by illegal miners. When NRD made proposals for

preventing this, they were permitted back to the Concessions.

The Tribunal finds that there was no unfair or discriminatory treatment of the Claimants or

of NRD.

This is another area of the case where the Claimants have alleged a failure on the part of
Rwanda to accord to the Claimants the level of protection and security required under
international law, contrary to Article 5(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal accepts Rwanda’s
submission that no breach of Article 5(1) is made out.?*° The Tribunal finds that NRD
could reasonably have been expected, itself, to take steps to prevent illegal mining in its

concessions, as it ultimately did.

(8) Did the seizures and sales of NRD’s property by the Court Bailiff in and after
2013 involve a breach of Rwanda’s obligations under the BIT?

427. Inher First Witness Statement, Ms. Mruskovicova alleges:

Bailiff [Bosco] many times stole assets from Claimants by claiming
to seize them pursuant to a court order. He never provided proof
that he had a right to seize the assets. For the seizure he always
came with the police and sometimes with the military. In total he
stole around USD $800,000. He never followed any Rwandan
procedure or rules. He never said or gave us a document explaining
what he is going to do with the asset. What he did was simple theft.
I always reported him to the US Embassy and Rwanda security
services hoping that one day the local police would take action
against his criminality.?°"

428. These allegations were not advanced in the Claimants’ Memorial. The Claimants’ case in
relation to the activities of Bailiff Bosco has developed over time. Initially, the allegation
was that he gave improper assistance to Mr. Benzinge. The Claimants’ Memorial alleges
that, in the two month period from June to August, when Mr. Benzinge was claiming to be
the owner of NRD, Bailiff Bosco attempted to “auction much of Claimants’ property and
assets”. NRD complained to Mr. Busingye, the Minister of Justice, who suspended Bailiff
Bosco from office, only to reinstate him a month later. Bailiff Bosco, and other bailiffs,
continued to seize NRD’s assets, purportedly to enforce court judgments. *** NRD sought

assistance from the police but this was not forthcoming:

[T]he policy [sic] and Rwandan government appeared to be helping
bailiffs carry out illegal seizures of Claimants[’] property.?°°

The Claimants’ Reply summarises their case as:

So it came to be that, with Respondents’ [sic] blessing,
Mr. Benzinge, a Rwandan national, continued to receive assistance
to the detriment of Claimants. ?°°

At the end of the Reply, there is a heading alleging that Rwanda’s witnesses were biased
against NRD, followed by particulars of the alleged bias in relation to each witness. In

relation to Bailiff Bosco it is alleged:

As has been presented above in this Reply, it is Claimants[’] belief

that Mr. [Bosco] acted in concert with Ben Benzinge to steal from

NRD pursuant to fraudulent court orders.”
In the Claimants’ Pre-Hearing Brief, it is alleged that Bailiff Bosco, together with
Mr. Imena, were at the centre of unfair treatment of the Claimants’ investments in their
assistance of Mr. Benzinge. Seizures of NRD’s property by Bailiff Bosco could not “be

credibly passed off as neutral enforcement of a creditor’s judgment”.??

Bailiff Bosco denied Ms. Mruskovicova’s allegations in a detailed First Witness Statement.
He gave an account of the seizure and ultimate sale of ore owned by NRD in execution of

a judgment debt owed by NRD to a Mr. Pascal Rwakirenga. 7°

He gave a further account of attempts to enforce the 17 May Award of RwF16,300,000

made in favour of Mr. Benzinge?**

and judgment debts owed to 25 other litigants, mostly
NRD employees. These attempts stalled when the Minister of Justice, as a result of protest
by Mr. Marshall, suspended Bailiff Bosco. After he had produced documents
demonstrating that he had been acting in the proper performance of his duties as a Bailiff
he was reinstated, but was unsuccessful in enforcing the debts, save for US$9,000 realised

by the sale of Mr. Marshall’s car. 7°

Bailiff Bosco gave oral evidence. °° His cross-examination consisted to a large extent of
questions as to why documents that would have supported his Witness Statement had not

been attached to it. Bailiff Bosco found these questions a little confusing. He stated that he

had produced a very large document, about 100 pages long, that would have included such
documents. 7°” The Tribunal intervened to suggest that if counsel was going to suggest that
Bailiff Bosco’s evidence was untruthful it would be fair to make this plain to him.?°*
Counsel sought to do this by stating, in relation to an inventory that Bailiff Bosco had

referred to in evidence:

I want to be very clear: I don’t believe it exists, I don’t believe it is
referenced.?°
It was not clear to the Tribunal, nor can it have been clear to Bailiff Bosco, precisely what

the Claimants’ positive case was in relation to Mr. Bosco’s activities.

The Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief has not clarified the position. The Claimants do not
advance the express allegation made by Ms. Mruskovicova that Bailiff Bosco was stealing
from NRD. Bailiff Bosco’s evidence is attacked on the grounds of inconsistencies and lack

of supporting documentary evidence. It is alleged that:

[I]t should be inferred that Mr. [Bosco], with the authority of the

Ministry of Justice, was acting to specifically harm NRD for the

benefit of Mr. Benzinge and others.>°
Having heard Bailiff Bosco give evidence, the Tribunal is left in no doubt that he was an
honest man attempting, in difficult circumstances, to carry out his professional duties as a
bailiff. There is quite enough documentary evidence on the record to corroborate his
evidence. The fact that the Minister suspended him, in response to protests from
Mr. Marshall that proved unfounded, cannot be reconciled with the allegation that he and
the Ministry were working in partnership improperly to prejudice NRD. The Tribunal finds
that neither Bailiff Bosco nor the Ministry of Justice was guilty of any impropriety and that

Bailiff Bosco’s activities involved no breach of Rwanda’s obligations under the BIT.

(9) Did the denial of the issue of tags constitute a breach of Rwanda’s obligations
under the BIT?

The primary facts in relation to this issue are not in dispute.

On 21 July 2010, the United States brought into force the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act.*°! Section 1502 of this, headed “CONFLICT MINERALS”,
drew attention to the belief that the exploitation and trade of conflict materials originating
in the DRC was helping to finance conflict in that country involving extreme levels of

violence, particularly sexual and gender based violence.

Rwanda is party to the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative (“iTSCi’”) designed to
ensure that only minerals mined responsibly enter the international supply chain. *° To this
end, Rwanda takes part in a tagging scheme under which minerals mined in Rwanda are
bagged and tagged. This is designed to prevent the smuggling into and sale in Rwanda of

minerals originating in the DRC.

Up until 2014, tags were supplied to NRD to enable the tagging of minerals mined by NRD.
In 2014, however, Mr. Imena procured the suspension of the issue of tabs to NRD. This
meant that NRD was unable to market the minerals that it mined. No similar suspension
was imposed on any other mining company. The Claimants allege in their Memorial that
this constituted a breach of the obligation owed by Rwanda under the BIT to treat the

Claimants fairly and equitably. *°?
In its Counter Memorial, Rwanda relies on the following explanation given by Mr. Imena:

In around the summer of 2014, I barred PACT, who coordinated the
[iTSCi] programme in Rwanda, from issuing tags for NRD’s
minerals. I did so primarily because I wanted to put pressure on
NRD to regularise its operations by applying for and obtaining
licences for its concessions. By June 2014 NRD had not had a
mining licence for any of its concessions since October 2012.
However, with our indulgence it was continuing to operate its mines,
through the artisanal miners, and was able to buy minerals from the

artisanal miners on its sites and have them tagged following which
it was able to sell them to traders in Kigali. It was able to do all of
this without a licence and without making any investment into any
of its mines.

Although I had made clear to Mr. Marshall since I met him in
October 2013 that NRD needed to re-apply for its licences, by mid-
2014 NRD had not taken any steps to do so and I did not believe that
they had any intention of doing so — it seemed quite clear to me that
NRD were quite happy to continue operating their mines without a
licence so long as they were able to receive tags and that they had
no real interest in pursuing their licence applications which would
require a commitment to investment and development of the mines.
I therefore instructed PACT not to issue any further tags to NRD in
order to put pressure on NRD to regulate their position by applying
for and obtaining licences. It was not long afier I instructed PACT
not to issue any further tags to NRD that NRD submitted its
September 2014 application for licences.>**

442. Ina passage not quoted in the Counter Memorial, Mr. Imena continues:

NRD should not have been operating without a licence and allowing
them to continue to have tags while they were operating without a
licence was simply compounding the problem and allowing them to
operate without regard to any law or regulation.>°°
443. Mr. Imena adds that he had a secondary reason for barring NRD from receiving tabs. This
was the dispute between Mr. Marshal and Mr. Benzinge as to who owned NRD.
Mr. Benzinge threatened to commence proceedings against the Mining Department if they

issued tags to NRD while Mr. Marshall was there. *°°

444, In his Second Witness Statement, Mr. Imena states that, as a result of protests by
Mr. Marshall, the OGMR prepared an opinion that was communicated to him orally by
Dr. Biryabarema, which confirmed his decision.*°’ That opinion, provided by a “Legal
Counterpart” commented that NRD had no mining licences for the mining concessions

where it operated and, thus, had had to re-apply under the 2014 Law. °° The re-application

was under assessment. NRD had no legal authority to carry on mining operations until its

reapplication received a favourable response. Thus it could not be granted tags.

445. At the Hearing, Counsel for the Claimants cross-examined Mr. Imena as to the basis on
which tags had been issued to NRD after the last extension to its licence had expired in

October 2012. The following exchange took place:

A, Yes, they were still recognised as the people operating the
mines.

Q. Well, how is that? Under Rwandan law, how could they be
recognised by the Ministry of Mines as both not a licensee at
all, but operating the mines and lawfully selling minerals
mined there?

A, I explained earlier that as long as — for a formal licensee
who applied for a new licence, as long as no final decision
has been taken, we considered that former licensee as the
operator of the mine.

Q. So the permission from the initial licence to NRD, your
testimony is, you recognised as continuing all the way to the
time when you told NRD it had to leave the mining
concessions?

A, You are right.
Q. And that is in 2015; correct?
That was the final decision, 2015.3
In their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants submit that this evidence renders untenable
Rwanda’s case that Mr. Imena barred NRD from receiving tags because NRD did not have
licences. Other mining companies in the same position as NRD received tags.*!° The
motive for refusing tags to NRD was to render NRD inactive, so that the miners would sell

illegally, and the tags that should have been supplied to NRD could be applied to smuggled

minerals. *!!

The Claimants advance no independent claim in relation to financial loss sustained by NRD
as a result of being denied tags. The relevance of this issue is the alleged motive behind
this denial. Up to the oral hearing the Claimants’ case had been that this was unfair
discrimination that constituted an incident in the ‘creeping expropriation’ of NRD’s interest
in the Five Concessions. The motive alleged in the Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief is a

novelty.

Rwanda in its Post-Hearing Brief submits that Mr. Imena’s conduct was reasonable and

that he acted in good faith in a fair, careful and appropriate manner. *!”

The Tribunal accepts that the motivation for initially denying tags to NRD was that stated
by Mr. Imena. He wanted to put pressure on NRD to apply for a licence and he was
apprehensive about providing tags while the ownership of, and the right to manage, NRD
was in dispute. Subsequently Mr. Imena received legal advice that it would be illegal to

supply tags to NRD, which reassured him that he had acted properly.

The Tribunal finds that Mr. Imena acted in good faith for the reasons that he gave and not
for the ulterior motives alleged by the Claimants. Nonetheless the Tribunal finds that the
propriety of Mr. Imena’s action is open to question. Permitting NRD to mine in the Five
Concessions but denying NRD the possibility of marketing the minerals mined was self-
contradictory and irrational. Neither accorded with the legislative scheme in place in
Rwanda for licensing mining — see further below. Each was the result of administrative
action outside the confines of the licensing regime. Under that regime NRD should either
have been licensed to carry on mining and provided with tags, or denied the right to mine.
Administrative shortcomings in the treatment of NRD did not however, of themselves,

constitute a breach of Rwanda’s obligations under the BIT.

(10) What rights over the Five Concessions did NRD enjoy and when?

In their Memorial, the Claimants submit:

32 Resp, PHB, para. 147.

113

The fair market value of the Concessions on the date of the Award

is the appropriate compensation for Rwanda’s unlawful

expropriation [...].3°
In their Reply, the Claimants cite several authorities for the proposition that concession
rights can be subject to expropriation and that denial of permits can constitute expropriation
in violation of an investment treaty. They allege that Rwanda confiscated their tangible
property and assets as well as intangible contractual rights to which they were entitled. *!4
These submissions accord with the Claimants’ practice of equating their rights with the
rights of NRD.*!> In the light of the findings made to date, the Tribunal turns to consider

what rights over the Concessions NRD enjoyed.

451. At the heart of the Claimants’ case is that NRD enjoyed a right to be granted long-term
mining licences in respect of the Five Concessions. There were two overlapping bases for
this alleged right. The first was that NRD had a vested contractual right to long-term
licences under the terms of the Contract. The second was that both NRD and Mr. Marshall,
representing Spalena, NRD’s ultimate owner, had been given a legitimate expectation that

NRD would be granted long-term licences.
452. The Tribunal has considered both those submissions in depth and rejected each.

453. The Five Special Permits 3!° were granted in 2007 by Ministerial Decree. >!’ The successive
extensions of these Special Permits that extended them to October 2012 were made by the
Minister of Natural Resources, Mr. Kamanzi. They were granted at a time when the 2008

Law was in force, but there is nothing in that Law that conflicts with the power of the

Minister to grant these extensions of the Special Permits. Although of short duration, the

extensions were valuable rights in that they permitted the mining and sale of minerals.

Those rights came to an end in October 2012 when the last extension granted of Special
Permits reached its term. Thereafter, up to 19 May 2015, NRD was permitted to remain in
occupation of the Five Concessions and to exercise the same rights as it had enjoyed under

the Special Permits. There is an issue as to the nature of NRD’s rights during this period.

In their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants submit that after October 2012 NRD was in

exactly the same legal position as if he had been given a formal licence:

Critically, express notice of license extensions, like the ones that
NRD received in 2011 and 2012, were not required. Instead,
licences were automatically extended until Respondent told a
license-holder otherwise. As Mr. Imena [...] clearly testified, “[a]s
long as the Ministry has not made a final decision on your
application, you are allowed to continue operating.”

With respect to NRD, specifically, [...] the Ministry did not need

explicitly [to] extend the licenses beyond October 2012 because the

extensions were implicit and formal notice of an extension was not

required [...]. Therefore, NRD’s licenses remained in effect,

meaning that they had the right to operate and mine, until at least

May 19, 2015, the day that Mr. Imena sent a letter “finally”

rejecting NRD’s application. 3!*
These submissions are founded on the answers given by Mr. Imena under cross-
examination set out at paragraph 445 above. They do not fairly reflect Mr. Imena’s
evidence. He did not say that NRD’s licences were implicitly extended to 19 May 2015 but
that, after the licences had terminated, NRD was permitted to continue its operations until

that date. That forbearance is not to be equated with the grant of a formal licence.

The Tribunal considers that the propriety of the ministerial practice of allowing former
licence holders to continue mining after expiry of their licences is open to question.
Mr. Mugisha commented on Dr. Biryabarema’s letter of 10 February 2013,*!? which

permitted NRD to resume mining activities while awaiting the result of requests for new

459,

licences. He said that this did not amount to a licence within the meaning of the 2008 Law.

He continued:

In my experience this short-term authorisation without any formal
licence issued under mining law was not exceptional, and I am
aware of other cases where operators were given similar sorts of
authorisation to continue to operate even where licences had
expired in order to give them an opportunity to prove that they
should be granted new licences; in practical terms it would have
been wrong to require them to cease operations entirely when a new
application was made, because that would prove disruptive of
operations [...].??°

The Tribunal appreciates the practical implications of which Mr. Mugisha speaks but

321

considers that, at least once the 2014 Law had come into force, **! it is hard to identify any

lawful justification for allowing an operator who had no licence to extract minerals in

322

Rwanda. The legal advice received by Mr. Imena*~* that NRD had no legal authority to

continue to mine after its extended licences had expired appears correct.

It follows that after their extended Special Licenses had expired in October 2012 NRD had
no extant legal rights over the Five Concessions. They were there on sufferance and could

be directed to leave by the Ministry at any moment.
(11) Did Rwanda expropriate any rights of NRD and, if so, when?
a. Mining rights

The Claimants’ primary claim is for expropriation of alleged rights to long-term mining
licences in respect of the Five Concessions. The Tribunal has found that the Claimants

enjoyed no such rights. It follows that the claim in respect of their expropriation fails.

320 Mugisha (1), paras. 29-30.

*2! See Articles 4.7 and 8 of the 2014 Law, CL-002, which appear, at least implicitly, to put in question the propriety
of the practice spoken to by Mr. Mugisha.

b. Tangible property

The Claimants’ Memorial makes no reference to alleged expropriation of tangible property.

The Claimants’ Reply, however, alleges that

Rwanda expropriated Claimants’ tangible property and assets as

well as intangible contractual rights to which Claimants were

entitled.>>
No particulars have been given of what tangible property is alleged to have been
appropriated or in what circumstances the expropriation is alleged to have occurred. The
Claimants have not suggested that when NRD ultimately relinquished occupation of the
Concessions in 2016 it was prevented from removing any tangible property. As Mr. Imena

remarked:

Rwanda did not take the Claimants’ investments, including NRD
itself. In this regard, I understand that NRD is still owned by the
Claimants.>*4

The Tribunal rejects the allegation, in so far as it was pursued, that Rwanda expropriated

tangible property owned by the Claimants.

(12) Did Rwanda carry on a campaign of creeping expropriation?

It would not be satisfactory to leave the topic of expropriation without addressing the
allegation made by the Claimants that Rwanda was pursuing a campaign of creeping
expropriation designed to force NRD to abandon the Concessions with the object of
removing the inhibition that NRD’ s presence posed to smuggling into Rwanda minerals

from the DRC. This is an allegation that has developed over time.

In their Memorial, the Claimants alleged that Rwanda turned a blind eye to smuggling and

that GMD tag managers issued tags when requested without asking questions. *?°

The Memorial goes on to allege that the refusal of tags, support for the activities of
Mr. Benzinge and requiring NRD to re-apply for the Concessions were three acts that
evidenced a pattern of mistreatment and a clear plan to drive the Claimants out of
Rwanda. *”° The Claimants rely upon this allegation in their Observations on the Request
for Bifurcation as an answer to Rwanda’s Jurisdictional Challenge ratione temporis. >>’ In
neither pleading was it alleged that Rwanda was trying to drive the Claimants away in order

to facilitate the smuggling into Rwanda of minerals from the DRC.

Some two months after the latter pleading, the Claimants delivered their Counter-
Memorial. This advanced the allegation of “creeping expropriation”. It went on to make

some remarkable, and novel, allegations under the heading:

The underlying reason for the expropriation was Respondent’s

desire to better control the smuggling of minerals from the

DRC 8
Under this heading it was alleged that a Rwandan oligarch, who had unsuccessfully
attempted to persuade NRD to arrange for the tagging of minerals smuggled in from the
DRC, had put pressure on Rwanda to force the Claimants to cooperate in the smuggling or
abandon their Concessions. The source of this allegation was Mr. Marshall’s Second

Witness Statement. >”?

These allegations were primarily targeted on Mr. Imena, who was alleged to have
withdrawn tags from the Claimants and forced them to re-apply for long-term licences in
order to “persuade” them to voluntarily abandon their investments or fall into line with the

“false tagging programme”. *>°

The underlying basis for Rwanda’s mistreatment of NRD was

Rwanda’s participation in illegal smuggling from the Democratic

Republic of Congo.**'
There followed extracts from a spread sheet showing exports of tantalum (coltan), tungsten
and tin exported from Rwanda in 2012 and 2013. It was alleged that upwards of 50% of
these exports originated in the DRC and that, in the case of coltan, the figure was 90%. It
was alleged that the only way that this discrepancy could be explained was by Rwanda
smuggling minerals from the DRC, tagging them in Rwanda, and exporting them to the

world as Rwandan.

The primary source of these allegations was Mr. Marshall’s Third Witness Statement.>*7

A concrete example of alleged inflated export figures was provided. This related to the
mineral production of a mining company called Rwanda Rudniki Company (“Rudniki”).
It was based on evidence provided by another of the Claimant’s witnesses, Mr. Jerry Fiala,
who was stated to be the owner and operator of Rudniki.**° In his First Witness Statement,
he expresses, in a single sentence, the belief that approximately 50% of all minerals and
90% of coltan exported from Rwanda originated in the DRC. **4 He does not state the basis

of this belief.

In his Second Witness Statement, Mr. Fiala states that the production of tantalum and tin
attributed to Rudniki on a spreadsheet produced by ITRI was greatly in excess of the
amounts actually produced. He concludes that the excess must be smuggled from the DRC;
the Government of Rwanda must be tagging smuggled minerals as originating from

Rudniki. 3°

This evidence was addressed by Mr. Niyonsaba, the Manager of iTSCi in Kigali since
2015. In his Second Witness Statement, he states that the spreadsheet of figures on which

Mr. Fiala’s evidence was based did not originate from iTSCi.**° He attributes the increase

in exports from Rwanda that Mr. Marshall alleged originated in the DRC to the continued
development of the mining sector and the fluctuating market, giving a detailed explanation
of these factors. *” He accepts that there was illegal mining in Rwanda and a black market
in tags, but stated that this accounted for only a very small percentage of the minerals

tagged in Rwanda. **8
Claimants’ Pre-Hearing Brief states:

Claimants’ witnesses will testify to the widespread smuggling that

was (and is) taking place in Rwanda. Claimants’ witnesses will

further testify that officials at the highest level of government are

complicit, whether through active participation or by turning a blind

eye to the obvious smuggling that is taking place.**?
When giving evidence at the Hearing, Mr. Marshall referred to the Claimants’ allegations
about smuggling on a number of occasions. *“° It was put to him that these allegations were

untrue; were Mr. Marshall’s invention. He would not accept this.

Mr. Fiala was tendered for cross-examination at the Hearing. He said that his role in
Rudniki was not a major one. From 2010, he had a 15% share bolding in the Company. He
was subject to a judgment of the Rwandan Commercial Court which held that he was not
a Director of Rudniki. He was dismissed from the Company in 2014. The spreadsheet upon

which he based his evidence about smuggling had been found by him on the internet. *#!

Counsel for the Claimants made no mention of smuggling in his opening address at the
Hearing. In cross-examination he did not put to Mr. Imena, or to any other of Rwanda’s
witnesses, the suggestion that Rwanda had been motivated by a desire to facilitate the
smuggling of minerals from the DRC. The Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief makes no

mention of smuggling.

478.

In his opening address at the Hearing, Counsel for Rwanda submitted that it was difficult
to understand the smuggling conspiracy theory and there was a total absence of evidence

to support it. *4? The case was evidentially nonsensical for three reasons:

qd) It was possible to see on the evidence what in fact happened to NRD’s application
for long-term licences. There was a contemporaneously documented transparent
process. This involved teams analysing NRD’s applications and explaining why

they were deficient;

(2) There was no conceivable basis for suggesting that Rwanda was promoting or even
condoning smuggling. On the contrary, Rwanda had put in place well observed and

thorough processes to prevent smuggling; and

(3) The Claimants sought, inferentially, to support their theory by misinterpreting or

drawing incorrect conclusions from bits of data and statistics.

The Tribunal endorses these submissions, but considers that there are additional reasons
for rejecting the “creeping expropriation” allegation. Had NRD been occupying the Five
Concessions under long-term licences and had Rwanda wished to remove NRD from the
Concessions, it is possible to envisage Rwanda repeatedly treating NRD unfairly in an
attempt to get them to relinquish their licences. But NRD had no right to remain in
occupation of the Concessions after 2012 other than that voluntarily conferred by Rwanda.
On the facts of this case it would have been open to Rwanda simply to have rejected the
2012 Application. Instead, over a period of about three years, Rwanda first granted NRD
repeated extensions of the Special Licences granted in 2007, then invited NRD to make a
new application under the 2014 Law and, when a deficient application was made, gave
NRD a series of opportunities to remedy the deficiencies. This behaviour was wholly at

odds with a wish on the part of Rwanda to get NRD out of the Concessions.

The true position was illustrated by a passage in the cross-examination of Mr. Imena by

Counsel for the Claimants. The subject was the repeated opportunities that were given to

32 Ty, Day 1, 120:24-123:10 (Hill).

121

482.

Mr. Marshall to submit a satisfactory application for long-term licences under the 2014

Law:

A, And, by the way, we had no legal obligation to give him an
extension. But because we wanted to help him and have him
as an investor, we extended to him that opportunity.

Q. And that’s the reason that you extended it: because you

wanted to have Mr. Marshall as an investor in one or more
of these concessions?

A, You are right.*

NRD was permitted to remain in possession of the Five Concessions from 2012 until 2015
and granted repeated opportunities to make a realistic application in respect of one or more
of them. This is more indicative of the good will that Mr. Marshall alleges he had earned
from pro bono assistance given to Rwanda in relation to matters unconnected with mining,

than of a desire to oust NRD from the Concessions.

In a passage in his cross-examination that dealt with the entire period that NRD was in
possession of the Concessions, after the take-over of the Company by the Claimants,

Mr. Marshall said:

It was a very unpleasant time. And we still, to this day, don’t know

exactly who had what motivations. Was it all to cover up the

smuggling? That’s speculation. **
The Tribunal has concluded that the development over the course of this arbitration of the
allegation that Rwanda was bent on a campaign of creeping expropriation in order to
further smuggling of minerals from the DRC was the product of Mr. Marshall’s

imagination.

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Rwanda observes that at the Hearing key parts of the Claimants’
case, including the false allegations regarding smuggling, were quietly abandoned by the

Claimants’ counsel, who evidently considered (rightly) that there was no proper basis upon

which they could be put to the Respondent’s witnesses. *4° The Tribunal agrees. The

allegations were scurrilous and unfounded. They should never have been made.

(13) Did Rwanda discriminate against the Claimants in favour of other investors
in breach of its obligations under Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the BIT?

The Claimants’ primary case has been that NRD had a vested right to long-term licences

to mine the Five Concessions, which Rwanda wrongfully expropriated. The Claimants

have, however, pursued, as a parallel theme, the allegation that Rwanda discriminated

against the Claimants and NRD, by comparison with other investors, in relation to the

manner in which NRD was treated during the period when NRD was seeking to obtain

long-term licences for its Five Concessions.

There was debate between the Parties as to the precise nature of the obligations imposed
by Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the BIT and the interrelation between them, as to which there
exists a body of jurisprudence. The Tribunal does not find it necessary to explore this. The

Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ broad proposition that:

State conduct is discriminatory and violates the [requirement for fair

and equitable treatment] if “(i) similar cases are (ii) treated

differently (iii) and without reasonable justification.” *“°
Some aspects of the alleged discrimination are not related to the grant of licences. Thus it
is the Claimants’ case that, in denying NRD access to the Western Concessions for a period
and in refusing to supply tags to NRD, Rwanda was subjecting NRD to adverse treatment
not imposed on any other contractors. The Tribunal has already addressed these matters.
They are indeed examples of treatment that was specifically directed to NRD and not to
other contractors. But the treatment was directed in circumstances peculiar to NRD and
was, contrary to the Claimants’ submissions, imposed in good faith. It did not involve

breach of the obligations imposed by either Article 3.1 or Article 3.2 of the BIT.

More pertinent are allegations related to the grant of licences. As to these, the Claimants
make three complaints: (1) other investors who had been granted short-term, four-year
licences made applications for long-term licences that were successful; (ii) NRD was
required to re-apply for long-term licences after the 2014 Law came into force, whereas
other investors in the same position were not; and (iii) long-term licences in respect of the

Five Concessions were ultimately granted to investors in which Rwanda had an interest.

a. The grant of long-term licences to other investors

In his First Witness Statement, Mr. Marshall states that the Claimants were encouraged by
the fact that Eurotrade International and Rutongo Mines Ltd were both granted long-term

licences after three years of negotiation. **”

Only limited evidence was adduced by Rwanda in relation to the applications for licences
made by other investors. The Claimants submit that adverse inferences should be drawn
from this. *4* Mr. Imena was asked in cross-examination about applications for long-term
licences made by other investors that, like NRD, had been granted four-year, short-term
licences. *4? From memory he identified ‘Rwanda Minerals and Mining’, ‘Roka Rwanda’
and ‘Trans Africa’ as investors whose applications for long-term licences had been
rejected. In his First Witness Statement, he had been able to be a little more specific,
naming: Roka Rwanda Limited (a company owned by Congolese and Rwandan nationals),

whose licence applications were rejected. 7°

Of the successful applicants Mr. Imena was able to remember ‘Musha Mine’, ‘Rutongo

a joint venture company of TINCO and Rwanda, in which Rwanda had, at the time, a

majority interest.*>! Eurotrade was owned 100% by TINCO. TINCO was a foreign

investor. *°?

Mr. Marshall himself, under cross-examination, distinguished between NRD’s activities
and those of Rutongo. Rutongo was a fully operational mine whereas NRD had a greenfield
site in the west and only a couple of brick warehouses at Nemba in the east. Rutongo’s

turnover was nearly 20 times that of NRD. >?

Mr. Imena deals in his First Witness Statement with the difference between Rutongo and
Eurotrade on the one hand and NRD on the other. **4 The former were large companies that
were well run and well-funded. Their production levels were much higher than those of
NRD. Their applications were credible and acceptable. Rutongo’s application, for example,
was much more detailed than anything submitted by NRD. In the four-year period of the
short-term licence Rutongo had invested over US$20 million on exploration, infrastructure

and equipment. Its workforce had grown more than tenfold.

It was Mr. Imena’s evidence that Rwanda had recognised at an early stage that Rutongo
and Eurotrade were proper candidates for long-term licences and that the delay in granting
these licences was attributable to discussions about the involvement of Rwanda in the

venture as a joint owner of Rutongo.

Paragraphs 36 to 41 of the Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief are devoted to allegations of non-
disclosure on the part of Rwanda. The Claimants allege that the material referred to by
Mr. Imena was the product of cherry-picking. Because the Claimants’ case “arises out of
the fact that Respondent treated Claimants different than other similarly situated
investors”, Rwanda was under an obligation to produce documents evidencing the details

of the applications made by those who succeeded in obtaining long-term licences. **>

Failing such disclosure the Tribunal should draw the inference that there was no

justification for preferring their applications to that of NRD.

The Tribunal rejects these submissions. They are founded on the premise that, at the end
of the four-year, short-term licence period NRD had applied for the grant of long-term
licences pursuant to the terms of the Contract. The Tribunal has found that this is a false
premise. The terms of the 2010 Application demonstrate that those then in charge of NRD,
under Sparck control, recognised that NRD had not satisfied its obligations under the
Contract, and hence was not in a position to apply for long-term licences. Instead NRD
applied for short-term licences. Rutongo and Eurotrade made applications for long-term
licences. The Tribunal finds, on the basis of Mr. Imena’s evidence, that they were justified

in so doing.

In summary, the Tribunal finds that, while NRD was treated differently from those
investors that were granted long-term licences, the two were not in the same position and

there was reasonable justification for the differential treatment.

b. The requirement to re-apply after the 2014 Law came into force

Some passages in the Claimants’ pleadings suggest that the 2014 Law was specifically
targeted at the Claimants.**° Wisely that suggestion has not been pursued. The Claimants
allege, however, that Rwanda unfairly discriminated against NRD by requiring it to make

a fresh application after the 2014 Law came into force.

Article 52 of the 2014 Law made Transitional Provisions that applied to licences granted
under the 2008 Law. **’ They did not apply to NRD because NRD had never been granted
a licence under that Law. The grant of the four-year, short-term licences predated it. When
the 2014 Law came into force NRD did not hold any licence, nor was it entitled under any
pre-existing licence to apply for a renewal or extension of the licence. It was in possession

of the Five Concessions under the informal authorisation described above. Mr. Mugisha

See, e.g., Cl. Reply, para. 95.

501.

502.

described this as a “courtesy’.*°* In these circumstances, if NRD wanted a long-term

licence it had to make a fresh application for this.

Rutongo and Eurotrade were granted their long-term licences in September 2014, shortly
after the 2014 Law came into effect. The Claimants allege that Rwanda discriminated in
their favour by not requiring them to make fresh applications. Mr. Imena replies to this by
stating that Rutongo and Eurotrade were in a completely different position to that of
NRD..*°? They had applied for long-term licences of 30 years while their existing licences
were still in place and therefore their applications were treated as a renewal and not as a
new application. Both applications were considered together because they were made at
the same time by companies with a common shareholder, namely TINCO. Their
applications had been found acceptable at an early stage but their processing had been

delayed by discussions about the share structure of Rutongo. >

The Tribunal finds that there were significant differences between the case of NRD and the
cases of Rutongo and Eurotrade. There was reasonable justification for treating them
differently. Indeed it would have been harsh to make the two companies submit fresh
applications for long-term licences when the delay in formally granting these was
attributable to Government discussions about matters that were unconnected with the

merits of their applications.

While, for these reasons, the Tribunal finds that there was no breach of Articles 3 and 4 of
the BIT in relation to the treatment afforded to Rutongo and Eurotrade, the Tribunal has
difficulty in understanding the basis upon which Mr. Imena suggested that their treatment
accorded with the provisions of the 2014 Law. This was not a matter on which he, or

Mr. Mugisha, was cross-examined.

Mr. Marshall alleges that no concession holder other than NRD was required to “re-apply”

under the 2014 Law.**! No evidence was adduced to support this assertion. Mr. Imena

t. °° He says that all companies that did not have a valid mining

states that it was not correc
licence when the 2014 Law came into effect and who had not previously submitted an

application for renewal were required to re-apply under the 2014 Law.

The Tribunal accepts Mr. Imena’s evidence on this point. More fundamentally, the
Tribunal does not see that inviting NRD to make a fresh application after the 2014 Law
came into force occasioned any prejudice to NRD. NRD’s prior applications had not been
successful. Absent a new, and improved, application there was no realistic possibility that
NRD would be granted any mining rights in relation to any of the Five Concessions, let

alone all of them.

c. The ultimate grant of licences in respect of the Five Concessions

In their Memorial, the Claimants allege that Rwanda expropriated the Claimants’

investments in order to provide them to Nigali Mining, a Rwandan company organized

under Rwanda’s own Ministry of Defence. *°

Mr. Imena refutes this allegation in his First Witness Statement:

[...] all of the former NRD concessions were put out for tender by
the Government in early 2016 and the successful bidders were
approved by the Cabinet in September 2016. None of the new licence
holders are Government owned and none are connected with the
Ministry of Defence — they are all independent companies. With the
exception of Nemba, for which a 15 year licence has been granted,
all of the licences are for five years. In addition, each of the licence
holders has been required to make a substantial investment
commitment. >%*

d. Conclusion

The Tribunal accepts this evidence, which was not challenged in cross-examination. It
concludes that there was no unfair discrimination against NRD in respect of the ultimate

grant of licences for the Five Concessions.

OVERVIEW OF MERITS FINDINGS

For the reasons given above, the Tribunal finds that Rwanda did not discriminate against
NRD in favour of other investors in breach of its obligations under Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of

the BIT.

The prolix allegations made by the Claimants of breach by Rwanda of the BIT have
resulted in a lengthy analysis in this Award. At the end of the day, however, the picture is

a simple one.

When Rwanda set about privatizing its mining industry, it offered short-term, four-year
contracts to investors to enable them to demonstrate not only their aspirations but their
abilities to revolutionize Rwanda’s mining industry by introducing industrial methods of
extracting and processing minerals in place of the artisanal methods under which extraction
was done by the wielding of picks and shovels by individual miners, to the detriment of

the environment.

Rwanda hoped, no doubt, to attract experienced mining companies. The evidence suggests
that it did not succeed. Instead, it attracted entrepreneurs without mining experience
attracted by the possibilities of profiting from the acquisition of long-term mining licences
in Rwanda. Of these Mr. Marshall was one. Mr. Marshall himself remarked that there were
no mining companies among the investors. This was certainly the case so far as those
behind NRD were concerned. Mr. Marshall described the Zarnacks as a plumbing company
from Germany and H.C. Starck as minerals processors who had never carried out mining
anywhere in the world. *® In the event, no less than five concessions were granted to the
Zarnacks and Mr. Benzinge. NRD was founded to exploit these concessions. The Zarnacks

pledged to invest some US$40 million, but did not do so. Instead they sold NRD to Starck.

Starck invested in the construction of a plant at Rutsiro but this was money wasted as the
concentration of ore at Rutsiro proved inadequate to make operation of the plant

commercially viable. *°°

Starck accepted that NRD had not satisfied the obligations under the Contract that were
preconditions to the grant of long-term licences and consequently caused NRD to apply for
short-term, five-year licences under the 2008 Law. Even this application was optimistic, as
was reflected by the statement in Clause 4.4(b) of the Spalena Purchase Contract that there

were issues associated with the renewal of NRD’s mining licences.

The letter from Minister Kamanzi to Mr. Marshall following the meeting on 12 December
2011 made it plain that there was no prospect of NRD being granted licences in respect of
all Five Concessions.**? That stance on the part of Rwanda never changed. Had
Mr. Marshall been content to seek short-term licences in respect of one or two concessions,

as suggested by Rwanda, there might have been some prospect of success.

Mr. Marshall had, however, the idée fixe of obtaining long-term licences for all Five
Concessions, and persisted in attempting to obtain these. It may be that he believed that the
pro bono assistance that he had provided to Rwanda, and was perhaps still providing, in
areas that had nothing to do with mining, would result in NRD’s applications being
afforded preferential treatment. Such treatment would have been improper. In the event,
NRD’s applications were fairly and thoroughly assessed by Rwanda, with the inevitable

result that they were rejected.

Since NRD was acquired by Spalena it did nothing to advance its claims to the grant of
licences. The 2010 Application included a proposed Activity Plan for Research that had a
budget of the equivalent of €382,000 to cover four years of exploration. This was a proposal
made when NRD was under the control of Starck. Under Spalena, there is no evidence that
any part of this relatively modest sum was spent on research. There is no evidence that any

exploration was done between 2010 and 2015.

Mr. Marshall’s aspiration was first to obtain long-term licences and then to raise funding

on the international markets to enable him to exploit these. He states:

NRD needed the long term licence. Without it, potential investors
saw NRD as too risky of an investment and were not interested in
investing. As a result of Rwanda [sic] delays and ultimate refusal to
grant a long term licence, I was never able to trade NRD on the
London Stock Exchange. Had I been able to, I expected to raise
substantial sums of money that I could have invested into the
Concession [...].°%
In their Reply, the Claimants make it plain that NRD’s only source of investment in mining

in Rwanda was income produced by the mining that it was carrying on.>”

In these circumstances, there was no prospect of NRD demonstrating that it was a

satisfactory candidate for the grant of mining licences.

Meanwhile, NRD continued to oversee the small-scale mining activities carried on by
artisanal miners in limited areas of the Five Concessions. In so doing NRD encountered a

number of material events, some of them untoward.

After 2010, NRD was initially permitted to remain in occupation of the Five Concessions
under licences granted in 2007. The licencing regime had, however been materially altered
by the 2008 Law. It was further, and more significantly, altered by the 2014 Law. These
Laws reflected a growing expertise and proficiency in Rwanda in the regulation of mining
activities. NRD does not appear to have recognised the implications of the reforms

introduced by the latter Law.

Apart from these changes in the law, NRD encountered a number of vicissitudes between
2010 and 2015. These included the malign activities of Mr. Benzinge, the puzzling 17 May
Award obtained by him in proceedings in which Mr. Marshall chose not to take part, claims
against NRD by unpaid miners and others, leading to enforcement by Bailiff Bosco,

environmental damage caused by illegal miners (which led to closure of mining in the

Western Concessions) and the denial of tags needed for the sale of minerals extracted from

any of the concessions.

In this arbitration, Mr. Marshall has sought to weave these events into a conspiracy by the
Rwandan Government, in breach of the BIT, to rob his company of what he has claimed to

be its rights. Both the rights and the alleged conspiracy have been shown to be illusory.
For these reasons, the Claimants’ case on liability is rejected.
FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE CHALLENGE TO JURISDICTION RATIONE TEMPORIS

The Tribunal has held that the “Cut-Off Date” for the purpose of Article 26(1) of the BIT
is 12 June 2015. No acts of omissions on the part of Rwanda can found a claim for breach
of the BIT unless the Claimants neither knew nor should have known before June 2015 of
the breach alleged. This inquiry has become academic in the light of the Tribunal’s finding

that none of the matters relied upon by the Claimants constituted a breach of the BIT.

FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE CHALLENGE TO JURISDICTION IN RELATION TO THE

CLAIM BY SPALENA RATIONE VOLUNTATIS

Arbitration clauses that make provision for a period of negotiations before the arbitration
is commenced have become commonplace and have recently spawned a substantial body
of both court and arbitral jurisprudence, to some of which the Parties have referred. It is
not uncommon, as in the case of this arbitration, for a respondent to challenge jurisdiction
on the ground of non-compliance with such a clause, but to accept that the tribunal should

defer resolution of the challenge until after the hearing on the merits.

Such a course is usually adopted where the respondent has no desire for negotiations but
wants another arrow in its quiver when the substantive dispute comes to be heard. This is
manifestly unsatisfactory. If a respondent wants a chance to negotiate, the appropriate

course is to ask for a stay of proceedings at the outset, to enable negotiations to take place.

Tribunals are understandably reluctant to rule that they lack jurisdiction after a hearing on
the merits has taken place. One way of so doing, if the circumstances permit, is to find that

the relevant clause is, on true construction, not enforceable. The Claimants urge that this

132

527.

528.

529.

VIL.

530.

531.

Tribunal should follow this course, at least so far as Articles 23 and 24 of the BIT are

concerned. >”

Another approach is to find that the clause goes not to jurisdiction but to admissibility,
leaving it to the discretion of a properly constituted arbitral tribunal, what action, if any,
should be taken in respect of the clause. The Claimants come close to this in urging the

Tribunal to treat both clauses as being procedural rather than as going to jurisdiction. >”!

The Claimants further make the forceful point that both Article 23 and 24 were satisfied in
relation to the claims brought in the name of Bay View, and the claims in the name of
Spalena are identical. Rwanda can have suffered no relevant prejudice in these

circumstances.

The Tribunal has decided not to entertain further the challenge that Rwanda has made to
its jurisdiction on what are technical and unattractive grounds. The appropriate course is to

determine this arbitration on the merits, which the Tribunal will now proceed to do.

For the reasons given, the Tribunal orders that the Claimants’ claim is dismissed in its

entirety.

COSTS

THE CLAIMANTS’ COSTS SUBMISSION

The Claimants delivered their Submission on Costs (“CCS”) on 10 September 2021.

The CCS submits that the Respondent should be ordered to pay all the arbitration costs
incurred by the Claimants including legal fees and expenses together with the expended
portion of the payments made by the Claimants to ICSID in respect of its costs in relation

to this arbitration.

532. The Claimants have submitted a schedule of legal costs and expenses totalling

US$1,510,414, broken down as follows:

e Lodging Fee and Advance Payments made to ICSID: US$450,000;

e Fees and expenses of Counsel:

°

From 4 January 2018 to 30 June 2018: US$47,153;

From | July 2018 to 31 December 2018: US$41,434;
From 1| January 2019 to 31 March 2019: US$133,111;
From | May 2019 to 31 August 2019: US$99,985;

From 1 September 2019 to 21 January 2020: US$120,210;
From 28 January 2020 to 30 June 2020: US$218,445;
From 1 June 2020 to 2 October 2020: US$49,256; and

From | April 2021 to 13 August 2021: US$350,820.

The Claimants’ primary case is that they should recover all these costs. This is on the

premise that the Claimants’ substantive claim has succeeded and that costs should follow

the event. >”? The CCS advances, however, a number of criticisms of the manner in which

the Respondent conducted these proceedings.

533. The Claimants advance two alternative claims (the “First and Second Alternative

Claims”). It is reasonable to imply that these are advanced on the premise that the

Claimants’ substantive claim has been dismissed.

534. The First Alternative Claim is in respect of the costs and fees arising out of the

Respondent’s preliminary objections in relation to jurisdiction and the associated Request

for Bifurcation. The sum claimed in respect of these costs is US$99,985. This claim is

32 CCS, para. 6.

134

535.

536.

537.

538.

advanced on two bases. The first is on the premise that the Respondent’s challenges to
jurisdiction have been unsuccessful, so that in relation to this issue costs should follow the
event. The alternative basis is that the applications for bifurcation were refused by the
Tribunal or withdrawn, so that the Claimants should be treated as the successful Party in

respect of these applications.

The Second Alternative Claim is in respect of the costs relating to the Respondent’s
Application for Security for Costs. The sum claimed in respect of these costs is US$49,256.
The ground for this claim is that the Application was rejected, so that the Claimants were

the successful Party in respect of this Application.
THE RESPONDENT’S COSTS SUBMISSION
The Respondent delivered its Submission on Costs (“RCS”) on 10 September 2021.

Like the Claimants, the Respondent invokes the principle that costs should follow the
event. The Respondent submits, however, that aspects of the Claimants’ behaviour should

result in “a substantial costs award in the Respondent's favour, irrespective of the outcome

of the case” >”

The Respondent puts forward a schedule of costs and expenses totalling £1,689,046,

broken down as follows:

e Advance Payments made to ICSID: US$424,950 (i.e, £314,060 as claimed by the
Respondent);

e Fees of Joseph Hage Aaronson LLP: £962,766.90;

e Expenses: £399,497.55; and

e Expert fees and expenses: £12,735.55.

544,

545.

The Respondent claims, on the premise that it is the prevailing Party, all the costs. Insofar
as there remains a balance in the hands of ICSID, the Respondent seeks an Order that this
be paid in full to the Respondent, thereby reducing the Respondent’s claim to
costs pro tanto. Such an Order would not fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Any
balance of funds in the hands of ICSID will be returned by ICSID to the Parties who

provided this. The Respondent also claims an award of interest on the costs awarded.
THE CLAIMANTS’ REPLY TO THE RESPONDENT’S SUBMISSION ON COSTS

The Claimants’ Reply to the Respondent’s Submission on Costs (“CRRS”) was delivered
on 24 September 2021.

The Claimants submit that the Respondent has not provided sufficient details of its claim
to costs to enable the Tribunal to determine whether these are reasonable and that, in these

circumstances, no costs should be awarded to the Respondent.

Apart from this, the CRRS is largely directed to meeting the alleged criticisms of the
Claimants’ conduct advanced by the Respondent in support of the Respondent’s contention
that a substantial award of costs should be made against the Claimants in any event. As the
Tribunal has found in favour of the Respondent on the merits, there is no need to set out

these submissions.
THE RESPONDENT’S REPLY TO THE CLAIMANTS’ SUBMISSION ON COSTS

The Respondent’s Reply to the Claimants’ Submission on Costs (“RRCS”) was delivered
on 24 September 2021.

The RRCS rebuts criticisms made by the CCS of the Respondent’s conduct of the
proceedings. More pertinently it addresses the two Alternative Claims advanced by the

Claimants.

In relation to the First Alternative Claim, the Respondent submits that its Request for
Bifurcation was justified and approved by the Tribunal. The Claimants then shifted their

case, resulting in the Tribunal’s direction that the challenge ratione temporis should be

136

546.

547.

548.

549,

determined after the merits hearing. In these circumstances, the Respondent reasonably

withdrew its Request for Bifurcation in relation to the other jurisdictional issues.

In relation to the Second Alternative Claim, the Respondent contends that its Application
for Security for Costs was reasonable. Before the application was made, the Respondent
sought information about the source of the Claimants’ funding of this arbitration. The
Claimants did not provide this. Only after the Respondent’s Application for Security for
Costs did the Claimants state that there was no third-party funding agreement in place and
that the Claimants were responsible for the fees associated with the arbitration. >” In these
circumstances, the Respondent maintains that it should recover the costs of the Application

for Security for Costs.
THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON COSTS
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings and shall decide how and
by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of
the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre
shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

 

The Tribunal considers that this is pre-eminently a case where the successful party should
recover its costs. The Claimants’ claims against Rwanda have been demonstrated to be
without foundation. Serious and groundless allegations have been made against the probity
of Rwanda and its officers. These have ranged over a wide canvas and have been

thoroughly addressed by the lawyers acting for Rwanda.

Rwanda has not put forward a detailed bill of legal costs. The Tribunal is satisfied,
however, that the amount claimed reasonably reflects the legal services provided by
Rwanda’s lawyers. In so concluding the Tribunal has had regard to the legal costs of the
Claimants. Rwanda’s costs exceed these, but the major burden has not been that of putting

forward the Claimants’ case, but of rebutting this. Nonetheless, the Tribunal considers that

34 RRCS, para. 15.

137

550.

551.

552.

553.

a moderate discount should be made when deciding how much of the amount claimed

should be recovered from the Respondents — see paragraph 552 below.

The Tribunal is satisfied that it is right to include in the costs to be recovered by Rwanda
those devoted to the Request for Bifurcation. Bifurcation did not take place because the
Claimants advanced, after the Request was made, allegations of fact that had to be

investigated as part of the Hearing but which proved unfounded.

The Tribunal does not, however, consider that Rwanda should recover any costs in relation
to the Application for Security for Costs. While it was not unreasonable to make the initial
Application, security for costs is only ordered in international arbitrations in exceptional
circumstances. Had the Claimants provided information about their funding of the
arbitration when the Respondent originally requested this the Application might have been
avoided. In the event, the Application was rejected. In these circumstances the Tribunal
has concluded that neither Party should recover from the other any costs incurred in relation

to the Application for Security for Costs.

Such costs form part of the global claim of £962,766.90 in respect of the fees of Joseph
Hage Aaronson. The Tribunal considers that justice will be done if the amount that Rwanda
is awarded in respect of this item of its claim for costs is reduced to £900,000 to reflect the
costs relating to the Application for Security for Costs, and the discount referred to in

paragraph 549 above.

The costs of the Arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the
Tribunal’s Assistant, ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount

to US$723,667.44:

Fees and Expenses of the Members of the
Tribunal and Tribunal Assistant:

Lord Phillips KG, PC, President US$182,937.49

After repayment by ICSID of part of the unused advances claimed in the Respondent’s
Submission on Costs at paragraph 538 above, Rwanda has contributed to these costs the

amount of US$361,783.72.

Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimants to pay to Rwanda:

Fees of Joseph Hage Aaronson LLP £900,000
Expenses £399,497.55

Costs of the Arbitration US$361,783.72

Rwanda has claimed interest on costs awarded and the Tribunal considers it just that the
Claimants should pay interest, commencing from the date of the Award, and directs that

this shall be paid at the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) for GBP.
