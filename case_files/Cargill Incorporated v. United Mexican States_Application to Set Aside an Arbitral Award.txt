THE APPLICATION

0 The applicant United Mexican States (Mexico) secks to set aside an arbitration award
(the Award) made on September 18, 2009 under Chapter Eleven of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The award granted damages to the respondent Cargill, Incorporated
in the amount of USD$77,329,240.

[2] The arbitration tribunal consisted of Professor David D. Caron, Cargill’s nominee,
Professor Donald M. McRae, Mexico’s nominee, and Dr. Michael C. Pryles, chairman of the
panel, all distinguished experts. The Award issued out of the International Centre for the
Settlement of Investment Disputes (Additional Facility) at Washington D.C.

[3] The parties designated Toronto, Ontario as the “place of arbitration”. Accordingly, this
court has jurisdiction to review the Award under the /nternational Commercial Arbitration Act,

Page: 2

RS.O. 1990, c. 1.9 enacting the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration adopted by
the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on June 21, 1985 (the Model Law).

[4] The limits of this court’s jurisdiction to review is set out in Article 34 of the Model Law.
Tt provides, in relevant part:

(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the court specified in article 6 only if:

(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that:

 

(iii) the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling
within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains decisions
on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided
that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be
separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the award
which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may
be set aside ....

[5] Tt is Mexico’s position that the arbitration tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction, that the
award should therefore be set aside and that an award of USD$36, 166,885 be substituted for it,

THE PARTIES
[6] Mexico is one of the three signatories to the NAFTA.

[7] The respondent Cargill, Incorporated (“Cargill”) was originally established in 1865 in
Towa and is headquartered in Minnesota but has operations across the world. It is, among other
things, a global supplier of agricultural products, Cargill de Mexico S.A. de C.V. (“CdM”),
organized in 1967 under the laws of Mexico is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cargill and is
headquartered in Mexico City. Cargill, through its subsidiary CdM, was engaged in the business
of importation and distribution of high fructose com syrup (HFCS) into Mexico following the
advent of the NAFTA which came into force on January 1, 1994,

ARTICLES IN THE NAFTA GIVING RISE TO ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS

 

[8] Chapter Eleven of NAFTA deals with investments. The scope and coverage of Chapter
Eleven is set out in Article 1101 which provides:

This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:
(a) investors of another Party;

(b) investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party; and

(c) with respect to Articles 1106 and 1114, all investments in the territory of the
Party.

P.004/022

A “measure” is defined in Article 201 of NAFTA AS “any law, regulation, procedure,
requirement or practice”.

The jurisdiction of the arbitration tribunal arises under Articles 1116 and 1117 of Chapter
Eleven pursuant to which non-party entities who are investors as defined in NAFTA, have a right
to initiate a claim against any of the three sovereign states which are parties to NAFTA in respect
of a limited number of obligations owed by the party states as set out in Chapter Eleven and
Chapter Fifteen.

Articles 1116 and 1117 provide:
Article 1116; Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf

1. An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim
that another Party has breached an obligation under:

(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or

(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the
monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party’s obligations
under Section A,

and that the investor has incurred a loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of,
that breach,

Article 1117; Claim by an Investor ofa Party on Behalf of'an Enterprise

1. An investor ofa Party, on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that is a
juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, may
submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that the other Party has breached
an obligation under :

(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) State Enterprises), or
(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the
monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party’s obligations

under Section A,

and that the enterprise has incurred a loss or damage by reason of, or arising out
of, that breach.

THE ARBITRATION

[15] In 2004, Cargill, on behalf of itself and CdM, served on Mexico a notice of intent to
submit a claim to arbitration. It alleged that Mexico had violated articles 1102, 1103, 1105 1106
and 1110 of Chapter Eleven. In its Statement of Issues, Cargill posed the following questions:

A. Has the Government of Mexico taken measures that are inconsistent with its
obligations under Articles 1102, 1105, 1106(3) or 1110 of NAFTA?

B. If, so, which measures are inconsistent and at what time?

C. If so, what are the damages that are properly compensable to Cargill and
Cargill Mexico as a result of the Government of Mexico’s breaches of its
obligations under NAFTA?

[16] Cargill and Mexico executed a document consenting to arbitration under Chapter Eleven
of NAFTA and waiving their rights to court or administrative tribunal proceedings with respect
to Mexico’s measures alleged to be a breach of NAFTA except for injunctive and declaratory
relief not involving the payment of damages.

[17] In August 2005, the Secretary-General of the ICSID registered the claim in the
Arbitration Register under the /CS/D Additional Facility Rules. The tribunal was constituted in
June 2006 and the hearing took place in Washington, D.C. from October 1 to October 5, 2007.
The tribunal received oral and voluminous documentary evidence, expert reports, and oral and
written arguments. On September 18, 2009, the tribunal delivered its Award.

NAFTA PROVISIONS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN VIOLATED

[18] Of the five Chapter Eleven articles alleged by Cargill to have been breached, the
arbitration tribunal found three to have been violated: Articles 1102, 1105 and 1106.

[19] Article 1102 deals with “National Treatment”. The relevant paragraphs provide:

1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less

favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with
respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct,
operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.

2. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party
treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to
investments of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition,
expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of
investments,

Article 1105, dealing with “Minimum Standard of Treatment”, provides:

1. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party
treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable
treatment and full protection and security,

2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 and notwithstanding Article 1108(7)(b),
each Party shall accord to investors of another Party, and to investments of
investors of another Party, non-discriminatory treatment with respect to measures
it adopts or maintains relating to losses suffered by investments in its territory
owing to armed conflict or civil strife.

3. Paragraph 2 does not apply to existing measures relating to subsidies or
grants that would be inconsistent with Article 1102 but for Article 1108(7)(b).

Article 1106, deals with “Performance Requirements”. The relevant paragraphs provide:
3, No Party may condition the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage,

in connection with an investment in its territory of an investor of a Party or of a
non-Party, on compliance with any of the following requirements:

(b) to purchase, use or accord a preference to goods produced in its territory,
or to purchase goods from producers in its territory[.]

HISTORY OF THE DISPUTE

[22]

The factual background of the trade dispute between Mexico and the U.S. leading to

Cargill’s claim is complex, but as it is no longer in dispute that Mexico violated certain articles
of NAFTA, the history may be summarized briefly.

[23]

The dispute between Cargill and Mexico is but one battle in a larger conflict between the

United States and Mexico concerning their sugar industries.

AUG-26-2010 16:05 JUGDES ADMIN RM 170 416 327 5417 P.008/022

Page: 7

[24] Cargill is a producer of high fructose com syrup (HFCS). It is a low-cost substitute for
refined sugar for sweetening soft drinks and other food products and is therefore in direct
competition with sugar. The technology for mass-producing HFCS was developed in the U.S. in
the 1970s and, by the 1980s, U.S. soft drink producers used it almost exclusively as a sweetener
rather than sugar.

[25] Cargill had started to produce HFCS in the U.S. in 1977, By 1993, Cargill was producing
HECS in its plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Towa, near the sources of raw material, yellow corn.

(26] Sugar is onc of the most highly protected agricultural commodities. In Mexico, the sugar
industry is very important as it generates a significant portion of its GDP. Mexico is also the
second highest per capita consumer of soft drinks in the world. Prior to the mid-1990s, soft
drinks produced in Mexico were sweetened exclusively with cane sugar.

[27] When NAFTA came into force on January 1, 1994, the U.S. was a producer of both
HFCS and refined sugar and Mexico was a producer of refined sugar. Mexico began to import
small amounts of HFCS from the U.S..

[28] The tariff elimination provisions of NAFTA allowed a transition period for the
climination of barriers to the sweetener trade between Mexico and the U.S. The tariffs were set at
15% in 1994, declining to zero by 2004, Removal of tariffs was very controversial for the U.S.
sugar market. The U.S. sought a bilateral agreement with Mexico to replicate certain trade
barriers to protect the U.S. sugar market. The bilateral agreement found its way into an annex to
NAFTA. Before ratification of NAFTA, however, issues arose in the U.S. as to how HFCS
would be treated in the calculation of Mexico’s reciprocal access to the United States’ sugar
market during the transition period. The U.S. and Mexico tried to resolve the issue with an
exchange of side letters but disputes arose concerning the interpretation of the side letters and no
agreement was reached.

[29] Cargill was one of the companies prejudiced by the lack of a clear agreement between the
U.S. and Mexico.

[30] Prior to the coming into force of NAFTA, Cargill had established, in 1993, a division
within its subsidiary CdM to start selling HFCS in Mexico. Before this, CdM had been
distributing other food products in Mexico. With the advent of NAFTA, Cargill built an HFCS
distribution centre in Tula, in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico. It built a new plant in Nebraska and
expanded its HFCS plants in lowa and Tennessee, It also built an HFCS distribution centre in
McAllen, Texas. Cargill’s U.S. plants manufactured the HFCS which it shipped to CdM at its
centre in Tula for distribution in Mexico. CdM did not manufacture HFCS in Mexico but
imported the product from its parent company at the U.S./Mexico border.

[31] As part of the NAFTA bargain, Mexico had replicated the U.S, import barriers for refined
sugar from third countries, Thus the price of sugar rose in Mexico after NAFTA came into force
and the price of HFCS came to have the same price advantage in Mexico that it had hitherto
enjoyed in the U.S. and, after 1995, consumption in Mexico of HFCS grew significantly. CdM’s
market share of sales of HFCS grew from 3.56% in 1995 to 24.84% in 1997.

AUG-26-2010 15:06 JUGDES ADMIN RM 170 416 327 5417 P.009/022

Page: 8

[32] Cargill also sold HFCS directly to customers in Mexico without CdM’s involvement.
Such direct sales lost as a result of Mexico’s measures and not having any connection with CdM
do not form part of Cargill’s claim in the arbitration proceeding.

(33] Between 1995 and 2000 the Mexican sugar industry experienced significant disruption
and financial pressure, Sugar surpluses arose due to a combination of displacement of sugar by
HECS imported from the U.S. or produced in Mexico by U.S. companies who had established
production facilities there, increased sugar production in Mexico and decreased domestic
demand.

[34] In June 1997, in response to pressure from its sugar industry, Mexico imposed anti-
dumping duties with respect to HFCS imported from the U.S. These anti-dumping duties were
the subject of proceedings before the World Trade Organization pursuant to the GATT and a
dispute resolution panel under chapter Nineteen of NAFTA. Ultimately the anti-dumping duties
were revoked in May 2002 and Cargill was reimbursed for the duties it had paid.

[35] Mexico took two additional steps, however, to address the disruption in its sugar industry,
It imposed a 20% tax on the sale or importation of soft drinks and other beverages that contained
sweeteners other than cane sugar (the IEPS Tax). It also required that all HFCS imports from the
U.S. have a permit issued by Mexico’s Secretary of Economy (the Import Permit Requirement).

{36] As a result of the TEPS Tax, it became prohibitively expensive for Mexican soft drink
producers to use HFCS and most reverted to using sugar. In 2002, HFCS exports from the U.S.
to Mexico fell 90% from the previous year and then virtually ceased. The U.S. initiated WTO
dispute settlement proceedings against Mexico and in 2005, a WTO panel held that the
imposition of the LEPS Tax violated the GATT, a ruling upheld on appeal. Thereafter, Mexico
brought itself into compliance with the GATT.

[37] The Import Permit Requirement was part of a decree establishing 2002 tariff rates for the
importation of goods into Mexico. To obtain the benefit of the NAFTA preferential tariff rate for
HECS, an importer into Mexico was required to obtain an Import Permit from the Secretary of
Economy. Without a permit, the imported HFC$ would be subject to the high non-NAFTA
“Most Favoured Nation” (MFN) rate applicable to HFCS imported from non-NAFTA countries,
The MEN tariffs ranged from 156% to 210% while the NAFTA tariff was 3% for 2002 and 1.5%
for 2003.

[38] Cargill presented evidence at the arbitration that every application for an Import Permit
made by CdM was denied. Mexico denied CdM’s permit applications on the grounds that it had
not satisfied the criteria to obtain a permit but Mexico refused to announce what the criteria
were.

[39] | Mexico’s measures had a swift negative impact on Cargill. The TEPS tax made the use of
HFCS uneconomic and caused Mexican bottlers to cancel their HFCS orders and revert to the
use of sugar, decimating the Mexican HFCS market and forcing U.S. suppliers, including
Cargill, to cut production. The anti-dumping duties prevented Cargill from shipping HFCS to its
subsidiary CdM while the duties were in force and the Import Permit Requirement prevented

AUG-26-2010 16:06 JUGDES ADMIN RM 170 416 327 5417 P.010/022

Page: 9

taking advantage of opportunities to sell HFCS to those Mexican bottlers who were able to
obtain relief from the LEPS tax. As a result, Cargill was forced to shut down several HFCS
production plants as well as its distribution centres in Tula and McAllen.

THE TRIBUNAL’S RULING ON MEXICO’S OBJECTION

 

[40] In the arbitration proceeding, Mexico raised an objection to the effect that the tribunal
had no jurisdiction to award damages in relation to loss incurred by Cargill arising out of its
activities in the U.S. as a producer and exporter of HFCS to CdM, referred to as the “upstream
losses”. Mexico’s argument there, which is reiterated on this application for review, was that
Cargill sought damages sustained by its operations in the United States and not for operations
relating to its investment, CdM, in Mexico. It is said that the arbitration tribunal had jurisdiction
only to assess and award to Cargill its damages in its capacity as an investor, and no jurisdiction
to assess and award damages that it may have suffered in its capacity as a producer and exporter
of HFCS.

[41] The tribunal held that Mexico’s objection did not go to jurisdiction but was instead an
issue related to the interpretation and application of NAFTA’s damages provisions, At
paragraph 154 of the Award, the tribunal stated:

It is not in dispute that there is an investment in Mexico in the form of Cargill de
Mexico. As the Tribunal holds there to be a violation of NAFTA Chapter 11
provisions by a measure relating to that investment and Claimant as an investor,
Claimant is entitled to claim for the loss or damage incurred ‘by reason of, or
arising out of, that breach,” Whether such damages encompass losses to Cargill
within its business operations in the United States is a question of interpretation of
these damages provisions and is not essentially a jurisdictional question.

[42] In the result, the tribunal held, at paragraph 519 et seq.:

519. To evaluate the damages claimed, the Tribunal has found it helpful to look at
the lost profits claimed as divided at the United State-Mexican border, with
those lost profits attributed to Cargill’s inability to sell HFCS to CdM as
“up-stream losses” and the direct losses of CdM as “down-stream losses.”

520, According to Article 1139 and the Tribunal's previous conclusions, the
down-stream losses are clearly compensable due to the violations of Articles
1102, 1105 and 1106 of the NAFTA, The issue, therefore, is whether those
up-stream damages claimed by Claimant, and objected to by Respondent,
are also compensable,

521. With respect to this disagreement, the Tribunal is aware that Chapter 11
applies only to measures relating to investments that are in the territory of
the State Party enacting the measures. It was for this reason that the ADM
tribunal determined that it lacked jurisdiction to award compensation for
“lost profits on HFCS [the claimants] would have produced in the United

AUG-26-2010 16:06 JUGDES ADMIN RM 170 416 327 5417

Page: 10

States and exported to Mexico ‘but for’ the Tax, as these losses were not
suffered in their capacity as investors in Mexico,”

$22. This Tribunal notes, however, that as it stated at paragraphs 147 and 352
above, Article 1139’s definition of investment is “broad and inclusive.” This
Tribunal therefore has little difficulty in determining that business income,
particularly business income so closely associated with a physical asset in
the host country and not mere trade in goods, is both an element of a larger
investment and an investment in and of itself...

523. With respect to the particular facts of this case, the Tribunal finds that the
profits generated by Cargill’s sales of HFCS to its subsidiary, Cargill de
Mexico, for CdM’s marketing, distribution and re-sale of that HFCS, were
so associated with the claimed investment, CdM, as to be compensable
under the NAFTA. Cargill’s investment in Mexico involved importing
HFCS and then selling it to domestic users, principally the soft drink
industry. Thus, supplying HFCS to Cargill de Mexico was an inextricable
part of Cargill’s investment._As a result, in the view of the Tribunal, losses
resulting from the inability of Cargill to supply its investment Cargill de
Mexico with HFCS are just as much losses to Cargill in respect of its
investment in Mexico as losses resulting from the inability of Cargill de
Mexico to sell HFCS in Mexico.

524, In this way, the situation of this dispute diverges from that which the ADM
tribunal faced. ADM and Tate & Lyle created a joint venture, ALMEX,
which began selling HFCS in Mexico in 1994 and commenced its own
production of HFCS in December 1995, which grew to be ALMEX’s “most
important product.” Cargill de Mexico, on the other hands, was not a
producer of HFCS and its HFCS business therefore depended on the HFCS
sold to it by its parent.

525. Claimant’s intent was to enter the Mexican HFCS market and attain a
significant share of that market; thus its investment included everything that
it took to achieve such a result. Viewed holistically, Claimant was prevented
from operating an investment that involved the sale into and distribution of
HFCS within the Mexican Market. The inability of the parent to export
product to its investment is just the other side of the coin of the inability of
the investment, Cargill de Mexico, to operate as it was intended to import
HECS into Mexico.

526. The Tribunal therefore determines that Claimant is to be compensated for its
net lost profits as determined for both Cargill de Mexico’s lost sales to the
Mexican market and Cargill, Inc.’s lost sales to Cargill de Mexico.

[43] Earlier, at paragraphs 349 to 358 of the Award the tribunal had dealt with the scope of
Cargill’s investment under Article 1139. It wrote:

AUG-26~2010

16:

o7 JUGDES ADMIN RM 170 416 327 5417

Page: 11

349, Respondent argues that Claimant’s Article 110 claim is not based on an

“investment” as that term is defined by Article 1139, The Tribunal
disagrees,

350. Under Article 1139, it is clear that Cargill de Mexico (“CdM”) qualified as

an “investment” both because it satisfies the definition of an “enterprise,”
and because it qualified as “real estate or other property, tangible or
intangible, acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic
benefit or other business purposes” (including the Tula distribution facility).
This is argued by Claimant and not disputed by Respondent. Claimant’s
claim, however, is based on its “Mexican HFCS business unit and in the
HEFCS terminal at the Tula distribution centre” (emphasis added), Claimant
thus does not claim for the diminished value of the physical assets held by
Cargill de Mexico, but rather for the damages that resulted from the alleged
loss of their intended use.

351. Respondent argues that the issue before the Tribunal is whether this “HFCS

business” is an investment in and of itself under Article 1139 that is subject
to expropriation within the meaning of Article 1110. The Tribunal agrees
broadly with the Respondent’s identification of the issue presented, but
views the issue as involving two distinct questions: first, whether the “HFCS
business” is an investment in and of itself under Article 1139; and second,
whether the ‘HFCS business,” as an investment under Article 1139, can be
the subject ofa claim for expropriation within the meaning of Article 1110.

352 As to the first question, the Tribunal recalls its conclusion in paragraph 153,

supra, that there is no express or implied presumption that measures dealing
with goods cannot ipso facio be alleged to be measures “relating to”
investors or investments per Article 1101. It likewise concluded in
paragraph 147, supra, that although there are exclusions, the Article 1139
definition of “investment is broad and inclusive.

353. The Tribunal thus has little difficulty in concluding that business income,

particularly one associated with a physical asset in the host country and not
merely trade in goods, is potentially an investment both as an element of a
larger investment involving the physical asset and as an investment in and of
itself.

356, In Pope & Talbot, the tribunal was presented with a similar situation in that

the claimant’s ability in that case to sell lumber in the U.S. market was
impeded by a set of Canadian measures, Canada in that instance claimed, as
in this case, that the claimant retained title to the investment and that loss of
business was not the proper subject of an Article 1110 claim. The tribunal

AUG-26-2010 16:07 JUGDES ADMIN RM 170 416 327 5417 P.013/022

Page: 12

found that interference with the business had an impact on the property in
the host country:

While Canada suggests that the ability to sell softwood
lumber from British Columbia to the U.S. is an abstraction, it is,
in fact, a very important part of the ‘business’ of the Investment.
Interference with that business would necessarily have an
adverse effect on the property that the Investor has acquired in
Canada, which, of course, constitutes the Investment, While
Canada’s focus on the ‘access to the U.S. Market’ may reflect
only the Investor’s own terminology, that terminology should not
mask the fact that the true interests at stake are the Investment’s
asset base, the value of which is largely dependent on its export
business.

The Tribunal agrees with the Pope & Talbot tribunal that the business
income of an investment is an integral part of the value of the underlying
property. But in both Pope & Talbot and the present case, the Claimant has
not claimed for the value of the entire investment but rather only for the loss
of business income. Usually, in the case of a permanent expropriation of the
entire investment, the loss of business income would be reflected in the
value given to the entire investment, In this sense, the Pope & Talbot
tribunal did not address what this Tribunal considers to be the key question:
whether an Article 1110 expropriation claim may be based on a temporary
taking and thus only seck the loss of business income.

358. The Tribunal concludes that business income, particularly when it is
associated with a physical asset in the host country, is an investment within
the meaning of Article 1139 both as an element of a larger investment
involving the physical asset and as an investment in and of itself...

THE ISSUE TO BE DECIDED

 

[44] The central issue on this application is not whether the tribunal erred in law in finding
that both the upstream and downstream losses to Cargill were “by reason of or arose out of”
Mexico’s measures in breach of Chapter Eleven and thus compensable, Rather, the issue is
whether the tribunal was empowered to inquire whether the upstream losses were a compensable
area of loss,

[45] Mexico does not challenge the damages awarded insofar as they constitute CdM’s loss of
revenue that would have been achievable on sale of product in Mexico although it takes the
position that those losses are the losses of the investment only. It is Mexico’s position that the
tribunal had no jurisdiction to award damages to Cargill arising out of its activities as the
producer in the U.S. of the product that it supplied to CdM and which CdM imported into and

sold in Mexico. It therefore seeks an order substituting the tribynal’s award of damages of
USD$77,329.240 with an award of USD$36,166,885, payable to Cargill’s Mexican subsidiary,

CdM.

In Desputeaux vy. Editions Chouette (1987) Inc., [2003] 1 $.C.R. 178 at 22, the Supreme
Court stated,

The parties to an arbitration agreement have virtually unfettered autonomy in
identifying the disputes that may be the subject of the arbitration proceeding. As
we shall later see, that agreement comprises the arbitrator’s terms of reference and
delineates the task he or she is to perform, subject to the applicable statutory
provisions. The primary source of an arbitrator’s competence is the content of the
arbitration agreement (art. 2643 C.C.Q.). If the arbitrator steps outside that
agreement, a court may refuse to homologate, or may annul, the arbitration award
(arts. 946.4, para. 4 and 947.2 C.C\P.). In this case, the arbitrator’s terms of
reference were not defined by a single document. His task was delineated, and its
content determined, by a judgment of the Superior Court, and by a lengthy
exchange of correspondence and pleadings between the parties and
Mr, Rémillard.

Here, as in Desputeaux, the submission to arbitration consists not of a single arbitration
agreement but rather of a set of documents starting with Cargill’s Notice of Intention to Submit a
Claim to Arbitration. Following the empanelling of the tribunal, pleadings were exchanged
consisting of a memorial of the Claim, counter-memorial of the Respondent, reply memorial by
Claim and rejoinder memorial by Respondent,

The claim was launched under Chapter Eleven. It alleged that measures taken by Mexico
violated various provisions of chapter Eleven causing damages to Cargill and CdM, There are
four threshold questions that must be answered in the positive for the tribunal to have jurisdiction
over the claim launched under Articles 1116 and 1117 and they arise out of the scope and
coverage Article, 1101:

qd) Is Cargill an investor?
(2) Does it have an investment in another Party, Mexico?
(3) | Has Mexico adopted or maintained a measure, as defined by NAFTA?
(4) Do(cs) the measure(s) relate
(a) to the investor, Cargill, OR

(b) to the investment, CdM?

If the answer to all of the threshold questions is positive, are there express or necessarily implied
limitations on the scope and nature of damages open to the tribunal to award?

STANDARD OF REVIEW.

[49] Mexico argues that the standard of review where jurisdiction is concerned is correctness.
Cargill argues that the standard is one of deference.

[50] In Quintette Coal Ld. v. Nippon Steel Corp. (1991), 50 B.C.L.R. (2d) 207; [1991] 1
W.W.R. 219, leave to appeal refused (1990) 50 B.C.L.R, (2d) xxviii, the British Columbia Court
of Appeal approved the world wide trend toward restricting judicial control over international
commercial arbitration awards, citing the majority decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. y. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth Inc., 473 US, 614, 87 L. Ed, 2d 444, 105
S.Ct. 3346 (1985) wherein Blackmun J. wrote, at 638-9,

As international trade has expanded in recent decades, so too has the use of
international arbitration to resolve disputes arising in the course of that trade. The
controversics that international arbitral institutions are called upon to resolve have
increased in diversity as well as in complexity, Yet the potential of these tribunals
for efficient disposition of legal disagreements arising from commercial relations
has not yet been tested, If they are to take a central place in the international legal
order, national courts will need to “shake off the old judicial hostility to
arbitration.” Kulukundis Shipping Co. v. Amtorg Trading Corp. 126 F2d 178, 985
(CA2 1942), and also their customary and understandable unwillingness to cede
jurisdiction of a claim arising under domestic law to a foreign or transnational
tribunal. To this extent at least, it will be necessary for national courts to
subordinate domestic notions of arbitrability to the international policy favoring
commercial arbitration...

{51] Recognizing the importance of guidance to parties to future arbitrations concerning the
standard of review, Gibbs J.A, wrote, at p. 229,

The “concerns of international comity, respect for the capacities of foreign and
transnational tribunals and sensitivity to the need of the international commercial
system for predictability in the resolution of disputes” spoken of by Blackmun J.
are as compelling in this jurisdiction as they are in the United States or elsewhere.
It is meet therefore, as a matter of policy, to adopt a standard which seeks to
preserve the autonomy of the forum selected by the parties and to minimize
judicial intervention when reviewing international commercial arbitral awards in
British Columbia, That is the standard to be followed in this case.

[52] Hutcheon J.A., concurring in the result, put it more forcefully: (at p. 223)
“I ... would paraphrase a passage in Parsons & Whittemore Overseas Co., 508 F.2d 969 (1974)
at 976 that Quintette must overcome a powerful presumption that the arbitral board acted within
its powers.”

[53] The standard of “powerful presumption” that the tribunal acted within its powers was
adopted in Corporacion Transnacional de Inversiones, S.A. de CV. v. STET International,
S.p.A. (1999), 45 O.R. (3d) 183 (Sup. Ct.) at 190, appeal dismissed (2000) 49 O.R. (3d) 414.

[54] More recently, in this province, Armstrong J.A_ stated in United Mexican States v, Karpa
(2005), 74 OR. (3d) 180 at 34 et seq.:

[34] Notions of international comity and the reality of the global marketplace
suggest that courts should use their authority to interfere with international
commercial arbitration awards sparingly.

[35] In another context, Austin J.A. made reference to “the strong commitment
made by the legislature of this province to the policy of international commercial
arbitration through the adoption of the TCAA and the Madel Law...”: see
Automatic Systems Inc. v. Bracknell Corp. (1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 257, [1994] OJ.
No. 828 (C.A), at p. 216 OR.

[37] Quite apart from principles of international comity, our domestic law in
Canada dictates a high degree of deference for decisions of specialized tribunal
generally and for awards of consensual arbitration tribunals in particular.

[41] NAFTA tribunals settle international commercial disputes by an adversarial
procedure under which they determine legal rights in a manner not dissimilar to
the courts. This may suggest that such tribunal ought not to attract a high degree
of deference upon judicial review, However, T accept that there is merit in the
submission of counsel for Mr. Feldman that “the dispute settlement mechanism
and the need for expertise, all combine to indicate that the statutory purpose is to
take the resolution of these disputes out of the hands of domestic courts”. If this is
80, it would again suggest a high degree of deference on review by the courts.

[42] The matters to be decided by the tribunal in this case were heavily fact laden,
| will have more to say about the nature of the particular issues to be determined
by the tribunal later in these reasons. However, it is trite to say that a tribunal,
which is engaged primarily in a fact-finding task, is entitled to a high degree of
judicial deference.

[43] Taking the above factors into account, I conclude that the applicable standard
of review in this case is at the high end of the spectrum of judicial deference.

[55] | The weight of authority supports the respondent’s submission that the court’s approach
should be one of restraint and deference and that standard of review in considering whether the
tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction is one of reasonableness.

DID THE TRIBUNAL EXCEED ITS JURISDICTION?

 

[56] The Janguage defining the jurisdiction of the tribunal is Article 1101 combined with
Articles 1116 and 1117.

AUG-26-2010 16:09 JUGDES ADMIN RM 170 416 327 5417 P.O17/022

Page: 16

[87] | With reference to the threshold issues in Article 1101, Mexico acknowledges that Cargill
‘was an investor, and that CdM was an investment. Clearly the measures adopted by Mexico
related to the investor and the investment. The term “related” requires only some connection and
does not require that the measure be adopted with the express purpose of causing loss.

[58] As set out above, the tribunal’s factual finding was that the investment comprised more
than the bricks and mortar assets in Mexico together with the subsidiary corporate entity and its
income; it included Cargill’s business income derivable therefrom notwithstanding that a
segment of activity necessary to earn the income took place in the United States.

[59] Mexico’s argument rests upon the distinction between production and investment or
producers and investors which it characterizes as two different “capacities”. It argues that since
Chapter Eleven of NAFTA sets out obligations only to investors and not to producers, damages
for breach of Chapter Eleven obligations may only be awarded to the investor qua investor, and
not qua producer. It argues that damages suffered by Cargill that emanate from its loss by reason
of its production activities must therefore be outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal as those
activities did not take place in territorial Mexico.

[60] Mexico relies on a decision of an arbitral tribunal in Archer Daniels Midland Company
and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc v, the United Mexican States, (CSTD CASE No. ARB
(AF)/04/05, dispatched November 21, 2007, Supplementary Decision and Interpretation
dispatched July 10, 2008 (the ALMEX case). The ALMEX case also involved HFCS, The
claimants were separate U.S. producers of HFCS. They established a joint venture company in
Mexico, ALMEX, and established a production plant in Mexico where ALMEX produced
HFCS. The claimants also sold HFCS that they produced in the U.S. to the joint venture
company for resale in Mexico.

[61] The tribunal in ALMEX held, at 270 et seq.:

270, The Tribunal has jurisdiction to award damages which include loss of profit
suffered by ALMEX [the investment], but it does not accept the claims of ADM
and TLIA [the investors] for the profits they claim to have lost on the sale of
HFCS produced outside the territory of the Respondent State,

273. Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA applies to measures adopted or maintained by
a Party relating to, ier alia “investments of investors of another Party in the
territory of the Party’, and pursuant to Article 1101(1)(b) only measures relating
to investments that are within the scope of Chapter Eleven should be covered.
This means that the protection applies only to measures relating to investments of
investors of one Party that are in the territory of the party that has adopted or
maintained such measures. In a case such as the one at bar, this would exclude
investments of ADM and TLIA located outside of Mexico, even if such
investments are destined to promote fructose sales in Mexico.

274. The Tribunal has jurisdiction only to award compensation for the injury
cause to Claimants in their investment made in Mexico (through ALMEX).
Therefore, the Claimants are not entitled to recover the lost profits on sales of
HFCS they would have produced in the United States and exported to Mexico
“but for” the Tax, as these losses were not suffered in their capacity as investors
in Mexico,

[62] It appears that in ALMEX, the investment was found to consist of the joint venture
company and its business of production and sale of HFCS in Mexico.

(63] Here, the tribunal distinguished the ALMEX case on the facts, (see para. 524-5 of the
Award reproduced supra at para. 42). The tribunal viewed the investment in the instant case as
comprising importation of HFCS into Mexico and selling it to domestic users. One segment of
the business, the making of product, was accomplished in the U.S. in Cargill’s plants and the
other another segment of the business, distribution of the product, was accomplished in Mexico
by the subsidiary out of the facility at Tula. The tribunal found, as a fact, that the investment
included everything that it took to achieve the result of obtaining a significant share of the
Mexican market in HFCS, That there was integration, with the investment CdM being a wholly
owned subsidiary and a part of Cargill’s international operation was likely a significant factor in
that finding. It is not within the jurisdiction of this court to review the tribunal’s factual findings.

[64] Mexico’s treatment of CdM had the effect of annihilating it. The annihilation of CUM.
destroyed Cargill’s business of distributing HFCS into the Mexican market through its
subsidiary. To find liability under Article 1116 it appears that causation must be shown to the
extent that the loss or damage to the investor must be “by reason of, or arising out of” the breach
of the chapter Eleven obligation by the Party. The language of those articles does not require that
loss and damage be suffered in the territory of the violating party. The tribunal did not consider
the fact that loss was suffered in the U.S. to be a circumstance that either rendered the loss either
too remote or beyond scope of the tribunal’s jurisdiction, I am of the view that the tribunal was
not unreasonable in arriving at that conclusion.

(65] 1am not able to accept that the argument that the activities of producing and investing
delineate different “capacities” of a person, whether natural or artificial. The claimant has only
one legal capacity ~ that of a corporate person in its own right carrying on commercial activity
for economic benefit. Cargill has numerous businesses organized into five segments: agricultural
services, industrial, origination & processing, risk management & financial, and food ingredients
& applications. All are part of the constellation of activities done with the ultimate objective of
generating economic benefit.

[66] Neither Article 1101 defining scope and coverage, nor Articles 1102, 1105 or 1106
setting out Parties’ obligations, nor Articles 1116 and 1117 conferring claim rights set out limits,
other than causation, as to the nature and scope of damages recoverable, No provision stipulates
areas of activity or lines of business in respect of which compensation is recoverable if Chapter
Eleven obligations are breached by a Party.

Page: 18

[67] The tribunal’s assessment of damages hinges on its factual findings, set out above, as to
the nature of the investment and what is comprised in the investment. Factual findings are clearly
accorded deference and this court has no jurisdiction under Article 34 of the Model Law to
interfere.

[68] In my view, there has been no excess of jurisdiction, and the tribunal held correctly that
Mexico’s objection to jurisdiction is, in substance, an argument going to the merits — questions
of what the investment comprises in this case and what damages are sufficiently proximate for
recovery.

[69] An alternative argument was advanced by Mexico that the result is an unreasonable one
and reliance is placed on Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, [2008] 1 S.C. R. 190, 2008 SCC 9, It is
said that the result does not fall within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are
defensible in respect of the facts and law, It is argued that the tribunal’s reasoning was not
consistent with the aims of Chapter Eleven which is to protect investments only, It is argued that
Cargill, having chosen to establish a distribution facility in Mexico but not a production facility,
should not be put in better position in damages than investors such as those in the ALMEX case
which established a joint venture production facility in Mexico.

[70] The ALMEX decision is not binding on the tribunal in this case and was distinguished by
the tribunal in its reasons. As well, a consideration of the rationality of the result must take into
account the purposes, not only of Chapter Eleven, but of the NAFTA as a whole. Both the
preamble and Article 102, which sets out the objects of the NAFTA arc helpful in that respect.

[71] The preamble states:

The Government of Canada, the Government of the United Mexican States and
the Government of the United States of America, resolved to:

STRENGTHEN the special bonds of friendship and cooperation
among their nations;

CONTRIBUTE to the harmonious development and expansion of
world trade and provide a catalyst to broader international
cooperation;

CREATE an expanded and secure market for the goods and
services produced in their territories;

REDUCE distortions to trade;

ESTABLISH clear and mutually advantageous rules governing
their trade;

ENSURE a predictable commercial framework for business
planning and investment,

Page: 19

ENHANCE the competitiveness of their firms in global markets;

CREATE new employment opportunities and improve working
conditions and living standards in their respective territories;

[72] Article 102 provides:

The objectives of this Agreement, as elaborated more specifically through its
principles and rules, including national treatment, most-favored-nation treatment
and transparency, are to;

a) eliminate barviers to trade in, and facilitate the cross-border movement
of, goods and services between the territories of the Parties;

b)

ay

promote conditions of fair competition in the free trade area;

C,

2

increase substantially investment opportunities in the territories of the
Parties;

d

&

provide adequate and effective protection and enforcement of
intellectual property rights in each Party's territory;

¢,

2

create effective procedures for the implementation and application of
this Agreement, for its joint administration and for the resolution of
disputes; and

f) establish a framework for further trilateral, regional and multilateral
cooperation to expand and enhance the benefits of this Agreement.

[73] Viewed in the context of the NAFTA as a whole and bearing in mind that one of the six
enumerated objectives of the agreement is to eliminate trade barriers and to facilitate the cross-
border movement of goods and services, the result is not, in my view, irrational.

DID THE TRIBUNAL EXCEED ITS JURISDICTION UNDER ARTICLE 1105?

 

[74] T turn now to Mexico’s argument that the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in awarding
damages to Cargill for a violation of Article 1105.

[75] Article 1105 requires that each Party to NAFTA accord to investments of investors of
another Party fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. Mexico argues that
the benefit of Article 1105 accrues only to investments of investors of another Party and that

AUG~26-2010 16:10 JUGDES ADMIN RM 170 416 327 5417 P.021/022

Page: 20

investors have no right to claim damages for breach of Article 1105 ~ only investments have that
right. Accordingly, it is argued, under Article 1105, the tribunal has jurisdiction only to inquire
into the loss suffered by the investment. In this case, CdM’s loss is the lost revenue from sales
that it would have had in Mexico but for the measures.

[76] I am not persuaded that the tribunal erred in awarding damages to Cargill in respect of a
breach of Article 1105 by Mexico. The remedial provisions in Articles 1116 and 1117 are
cumulative and not mutually exclusive. In particular, Article 1116 is engaged if there is a breach
of a Section A provision (which Article 1105 is), and the investor, Cargill, is able to show that it
has incurred loss or damage by reason of or arising out of that breach.

[77] | There is no requirement that the damages awarded arising from the finding that Article
1105 has been violated be restricted to damages suffered by the investment, notwithstanding that
Article 1105 obli, fair and equitable treatment to inv rather than to investors, In my
view, Article 1116 contemplates a claim by an investor for loss that it has suffered by reason of a
measure that offends the obligation to give fair and equitable treatment to an investment of the
investor. In short, the language of 1116 is sufficiently broad to confer on the investor a viable
claim for damages that it has suffered arising out of a breach of the obligation owed to its
investment.

 

[78] In any event, Cargill and CdM are integrated and the tribunal found, as a factual matter,
that the subsidiary was part of Cargill’s business operation of selling HFCS into Mexico. It is
therefore not unreasonable in that context to find that the damages to the subsidiary are damages
to the parent even though they are two corporate entities.

[79] In the totality of the circumstances, however, it matters not whether some or all of the
damages was awarded under Article 1105 since the totality of the damages was, on the tribunal’s
finding as to the nature and scope of the investment, compensable to the investor under both
Articles 1102 and 1106, Accordingly, if there was an error in awarding damages to Cargill under
Article 1105, it does not affect the result as there is no suggestion that Cargill is entitled to
recover more than once,

[80] For the foregoing reasons, the application is dismissed. If the parties are unable to agree
concerning costs, I may be spoken to upon arrangement with my assistant.
