THE PARTIES

It provides mining services, including general survey services, exploration and exploitation
of mining sites.

The Claimant is represented in this arbitration by Messrs. Stephen Jagusch, Anthony
Sinclair, Alex Gerbi, Epaminontas Triantafilou, Ms. Bridie Balderstone, and Mr. Benjamin
Burnham of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan UK LLP, and by Messrs. Fred Bennett,
David Orta, and Tai-Heng Cheng of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP.

THE RESPONDENT

The Respondent is the Republic of Indonesia (“Indonesia” or the “Respondent”; and
together with Churchill, the “Parties”.

The Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Dr. Amir Syamsudin, Minister of Law
and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia, Coordinator of Legal Representative
Team of the President of the Republic of Indonesia; Mr. Didi Dermawan, Legal
Representative of the Regent of East Kutai and the Minister of Law and Human Rights of
the Republic of Indonesia; Mr. Cahyo R. Muzhar, Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the
Republic of Indonesia, Supporting Legal Team Member of Legal Representative Team of
the President of the Republic of Indonesia; Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson of Curtis, Mallet-
Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP, Supporting Legal Team Member of Legal Representative Team

THE FACTS

This section summarizes the facts of this dispute insofar as they bear relevance to
Indonesia's objections to jurisdiction. Unless otherwise indicated the facts are undisputed.

ok on eo

Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 4 of 18 March 2013, the present arbitration was
consolidated with ICSID arbitration ARB/12/40 initiated by Planet Mining Pty Ltd, an
Australian mining company wholly owned by Churchill. It was left open whether the
Tribunal would render one or two decisions on jurisdiction or awards. The Tribunal has
decided to issue two separate decisions (see below { 83). The facts and the procedural
history are largely identical in both cases.

THE EAST KUTAI COAL PROJECT

The East Kutai Coal Project (the “EKCP”) is a mining project developed by the Claimant
jointly with various Indonesian companies in the Regency of East Kutai on the island of
Kalimantan in Indonesia. According to various sources, the area encompassing the EKCP
hosts the seventh largest coal deposit on the planet and the second largest coal deposit in
Indonesia.’ The Claimant asserts that through surveys conducted over several years, it
has confirmed the existence of approximately 2.7 billion metric tons of coal in the EKCP
area.

The coal found there is classified as high-quality sub-bituminous coal with very low sulphur
and ash content.’ According to the Claimant, this high-quality coal is ideally suited for the
new generation power stations which have been developed lately in countries like India
and China and are also in high demand in Europe because of their reduced environmental
impact.?

Relying on a Feasibility Study modeling an evaluation of the EKCP for an initial 25-year
period,* the Claimant indicates that the project has a pre-tax net present value of
approximately USD 1.8 billion and pre-tax cash flows in excess of USD 500 million per
year over the first 20 years of capacity production.

On 10 March 2005, the Regent of East Kutai issued three so-called KP Exploration
Licenses to PT Nusantara Wahau Coal (“PT NWC”),° PT Kaltim Nusantara Coal

(“PT KNC”),® and PT Batubara Nusantara Kaltim (“PT BNK”)’ (together the “Nusantara
companies”) over areas that coincide with the future EKCP.

THE 2005 BKPM APPROVAL OF PT INDONESIA COAL DEVELOPMENT

On 23 November 2005, the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board (“BKPM”) delivered
an authorization to PT Indonesian Coal Development (“PT ICD”) to be incorporated as an
Indonesian foreign direct-investment company (a so-called “PMA”) and to conduct
business in the mining sector in Indonesia (the “2005 BKPM Approval”).® PT ICD was
initially created by Profit Point Group Ltd, a company incorporated in the British Virgin
Islands, and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi, an Indonesian citizen and co-founder of the Ridlatama
group.° The authorized capital of PT ICD is Rupiah (“Rp.”) 2,512,500,000, divided into
250'000 shares, with a nominal value of Rp. 10,050 per share."° Profit Point Group Ltd
acquired 237,500 shares and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi 12,500 shares."

According to the 2005 BKPM Approval, PT ICD could engage in general mining supporting

services, i.e., “consultancy in relation to business planning for construction of building and

other facilities in the domain of general mining projects”. '*

Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval contains a dispute settlement clause making
reference to ICSID arbitration in the following terms:

“In the event of dispute between the company and the Government of
the Republic of Indonesia which cannot be settled by
consultation/deliberation, the Government of Indonesia is
prepared/ready to follow settlement according to provisions of the
convention on the settlement of disputes between States and Foreign
Citizen regarding investment in accordance with Law Number 5 Year
1968”.

CHURCHILL AND PLANET’S ACQUISITION OF SHARES IN PT ICD AND THE 2006 BKPM
APPROVAL

In 2006, an Indonesian group of companies, the Ridlatama group, introduced the EKCP to
Churchill and Planet, who decided to invest in the project because they considered it
promising. As a first step, Churchill and Planet entered into discussions with Ridlatama
about acquiring PT ICD.

On 24 April 2006, Churchill and Planet acquired the shares in PT ICD from the initial
shareholders, Profit Point Group Ltd and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi.'® Churchill acquired a 95%
stake in PT ICD, while Planet acquired the remaining 5%. On 8 May 2006, the BKPM
approved the change in PT ICD’s shareholding (the “2006 BKPM Approval”).'®

The 2006 BKPM Approval incorporated by reference the terms of the 2005 BKPM
Approval, stating that “[t]his Letter of Approval is an integral part of Foreign Capital
Investment Approval Letter No. 1304/I/PMA/2005 dated 23 November 2005”.'”

On 31 August 2007, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and the Investment
Coordinating Board decided to grant PT ICD a Permanent Business License to undertake
general mining supporting services. "®

According to Indonesia, PT ICD was to report on the change in its shareholding to the
Minister of Law and Human Rights. This was done, again according to Indonesia, on
8 April 2008.

THE RIDLATAMA GROUP AND THE 2007 KP GENERAL SURVEY BUSINESS LICENSES

The Ridlatama group consists of seven companies incorporated in Indonesia and owned or
controlled by four Indonesian individuals: Messrs. Andreas Rinaldi and Anang Mudjiantoro,
and their wives, Mmes. Ani Setiawan Rinaldi (“Setiawan”) and Florita.'? The seven
companies are (1) PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral (“PT RTM”), (2) PT Ridlatama Trade
Powerindo (PT RTP”), (3) PT Ridlatama Steel (PT RS’),
(4) PT Ridlatama Power (“PT RP”), (5) PT Investama Resources (“PT IR’),
(6) PT Investama Nusa Persada (“PR INP”), and (7) PT Techno Coal Utama Prima
(“PT TCUP”) (together the “Ridlatama companies’).

Of the seven Ridlatama companies, the first six successively obtained mining licenses for
the area covering the EKCP. PT TCUP was initially established on 21 November 2006,
being authorized to engage in geological and mining services.

On 12 February 2007, PT RS and PT RP were granted by the Regent of East Kutai (the
“Regent”), and in accordance with 1967 Mining Law,” two General Survey Business
Licenses in two blocks of the EKCP area," covering an area of approximately 400 square
kilometers situated approximately 110 kilometers northwest of Sangatta.** According to
Churchill, the licenses lapsed in 2008 and the two companies became dormant because
no sufficient coal deposits were found.** In any event, these two concessions did not
overlap with any of the Nusantara concession areas (which according to Churchill had
expired in March 2006), so no dispute arose between the Parties over these two
concessions.”*

On 24 May 2007, PT RTM and PT RTP obtained from the Regent two General Survey
Business Licenses in the EKCP area,” and on 29 November 2007, PT IR and PT INP also

obtained General Survey Business Licenses,” increasing the EKCP area to approximately
775 square kilometers.””

On 25 May 2007, following the issuance of the General Survey Business Licenses to
PT RTM and PT RTP, Churchill and Planet, through PT ICD, entered into a Cooperation
Agreement with PT RTM, PT RTP, PT RS, PT RP, and PT TCUP;” and an Investors
Agreement with PT RTM, PT RTP, PT RS, PT RP, PT TCUP, Mmes. Setiawan and
Florita.”° At that point in time, Mmes. Setiawan and Florita held all shares in PT RTM,
PT RTP, PT RS and PT RP. On the same date, Mmes. Setiawan and Florita also
concluded Pledge of Shares Agreements with PT ICD, and PT RTM, PT RTP, PT RS, and
PT RP.*

The Cooperation Agreement concerned, inter alia, PT ICD’s obligation to “fully plan, set up
and perform all mining operations” in the EKCP area covered by the mining licenses of
PT RTM, PT RTP, PT RS and PT RP, in exchange for 75% of the generated revenue.”
The Investors Agreement concerned primarily PT ICD’s control over future transfers of
shares in PT TCUP, PT RTM, PT RTP, PT RS, and PT RP.*? The Pledge of Shares
Agreements served as security for the contractual rights enshrined in the Cooperation and
Investors Agreements.*®

of 2007, PT RTM, PT RTP, PT IR and PT INP filed applications on 10 March 2008 to
upgrade their existing KP General Survey Business Licenses to KP Exploration Licenses. **
On 8 April 2008, the Regent of East Kutai approved co-operation between each of the

license-holding companies of the Ridlatama group and PT ICD “to conduct exploration,

exploitation, processing and refinery, sales and transportation of coal minerals”.

On 9 April 2008, the Regent of East Kutai delivered KP Exploration Licenses to PT RTM,
PT RTP, PT IR and PT INP.*° The term of the KP Exploration Licenses was three years
with the possibility of two one-year extensions, for a total of five years. The KP Exploration

Licenses “allowed detailed surveys, including drilling and the definition of the mining

resources’”.*°

1 February 2009, this law adopted a new system of licensing through Mining Undertaking
Licenses (“IUP”), abolishing the previous regime of KP Licenses.

On 23 March 2009, PT RTM, PT RTP, PT IR and PT INP sent application letters to the
Regent to have their exploration licenses upgraded to exploitation licenses and to conform
to the new legislative framework. On 27 March 2009, the Regent granted these four
companies an upgrade of their licenses and issued IUP Exploitation Licenses.*®

The IUP Exploitation Licenses are granted for performing construction, mining, processing,
refining, hauling, and selling the resource for an initial term of 20 years with the possibility
of two 10-year extensions.

THE 2010 REVOCATION DECREES

As previously stated, the Regent had apparently already granted on 10 March 2005 KP
Exploration Licenses over an area substantially overlapping with the EKCP area to the
three Nusantara companies, PT Batubara Nusantara Coal, PT Kaltim Nusantara Coal, and
PT Nusantara Wahau Coal.*® These licenses were extended for the first time by the
Regent on 17 July 2008, and again on 18 February 2010."

On 21 April 2010, the Ministry of Forestry dispatched a letter to the Regent of East Kutai
recommending the revocation/cancellation of the Ridlatama companies’ licenses in the
EKCP area because (1) the Ridlatama companies were operating without permission from
the Ministry of Forestry; (2) the Ridlatama licenses were allegedly forged; and (3) the
Ridlatama licenses overlapped with other permit areas.”

It is in this context that, on 4 May 2010, the Regent of East Kutai issued four Revocation
Decrees of the IUP exploitation licenses held by PT RTM, PT RTP, PT IR and PT INP,
relying on the letter that he had received from the Ministry of Forestry on 21 April 2010 and
on a 30 April 2010 report from the East Kutai Department of Mines.*°

On 17 February 2012, the Ridlatama group wrote to the Ministry of Forestry requesting a
clarification of the 21 April 2010 letter.* The Ministry of Forestry responded on
5 March 2012 that the April letter was only an “initial information” and that “the decision to
revoke mining license (IUP) by the East Kutai Bupati [i.e., the Regent], which was based

solely on the Ministry Letter was not correct”.®°

shareholders of PT TCUP voted unanimously in favor of PT ICD’s entry as majority
shareholder. On 30 March 2010, PT TCUP obtained the BKPM Approval to operate as a
PMA company, i.e., to have foreign shareholders.®° On 16 April 2010, PT TCUP amended
its Articles of Association to increase its authorized capital and issue new shares.*' On
15 June 2010, PT TCUP obtained the approval for this amendment by the Minister of Law
and Human Rights.™ Following this approval, PT TCUP increased its shares, and PT ICD
acquired direct ownership of 99.01% of the shares, while Churchill acquired on
25 November 2010 the remaining 0.99% of PT TCUP’s shares, making Churchill the 100%
ultimate owner of PT TCUP.®°

THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE INDONESIAN COURTS

Following the 4 May 2010 Revocation Decrees, the Ridlatama companies engaged in
several legal proceedings against the Indonesian State to seek the annulment of the
revocations.™ Members of the Ridlatama Group also started legal actions against Churchill
and Planet, while the latter two initiated still other proceedings against members of the
Ridlatama Group.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

INITIAL PHASE

The present arbitration is between Churchill and Indonesia. Their dispute is brought before
the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”), under the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
Other States (the “ICSID Convention”) and the Agreement between the Government of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic
of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 27 April 1976 (the “UK-
Indonesia BIT”, the “Treaty”, or the “BIT”).® A parallel ICSID arbitration was initiated by
Planet Mining Pty Ltd, an Australian mining company, against Indonesia essentially
regarding the same set of facts. That dispute is brought under the Agreement concerning
the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 17 November 1992 (the “Australia-
Indonesia BIT”). Eventually, the parties to these two proceedings agreed to consolidate the
two arbitrations (see below § 58).

For purposes of clarity, the present section will first address the initiation of ICSID Case
No. ARB/12/14 by Churchill, followed by an outline of the initiation of ICSID Case
No. ARB/12/40 by Planet, and then conclude with the procedural steps involved in the
decision to consolidate both cases.

RMOJ, § 135. Letter of M&A Law Corporation to Churchill, concerning Claim of Breach of
Confidentiality No. IK/PM/AC/ms/0624.04/ct dated 7 December 2011 (Exh. R-093).

Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments
(“UK-Indonesia BIT”) (Exh. CLA-18; Exh. R-001). The BIT entered into force on 24 March 1977.

1. _ Initiation of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14

50. On 22 May 2012, Churchill Mining Plc filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID pursuant to

51.

Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and the UK-Indonesia BIT. In its Request for Arbitration,
Churchill requested that the Tribunal render an award:

“(i) declaring that Respondent has violated its international legal obligations
under the Treaty;

(ii) ordering Respondent to pay to Claimant full compensation in accordance
with the Treaty and customary international law, in an amount to be
established in the arbitration;

(iii) ordering Respondent to pay all costs of this arbitration, including, without
limitation, the fees and expenses of the tribunal and the cost of legal
representation;

(iv) ordering Respondent to pay pre- and post- award compound interest up
until full payment of the award at a rate deemed appropriate by the arbitral
tribunal; and

(v) ordering such other relief as the arbitral tribunal may deem appropriate in

the circumstances”.

On 22 June 2012, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered Churchill’s Request for
Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On 14 September 2012, the
Respondent requested that the Arbitral Tribunal in this case be constituted pursuant to the
formula provided by Articles 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. On 19 September 2012,
Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, a Dutch national, accepted his appointment as the
Claimant-appointed arbitrator. On 21 September 2012, Mr. Michael Hwang S.C., a
Singaporean national, accepted his appointment as the Respondent-appointed arbitrator.
On 3 October 2012, Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, accepted her
appointment as President of the Tribunal. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal in ICSID Case
No. ARB/12/14 was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) and the proceedings
commenced on 3 October 2012. On the same date, the Centre designated
Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu as Secretary of the Tribunal. After having obtained the agreement
of the Parties, the Tribunal informed the Parties by letter of 5 February 2013 that the

appointment of Mr. Magnus Jesko Langer as Assistant to the Tribunal had become
effective.

On 27 November 2012, the Tribunal and the Parties held the first session by video link.
During that session, the Parties agreed on several procedural issues and addressed
several outstanding issues which are outlined in more detail below. On 6 December 2012,
the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 containing the schedule of submissions for the
jurisdictional phase. It was decided that a hearing on jurisdiction would take place in
Singapore on 13 May 2013, May 14 being kept as a reserve day.

On 20 November 2012, the Government of the Regency of East Kutai submitted, with the
support of the Republic of Indonesia, a Petition to participate as a party in these
proceedings. Churchill objected to this request, asking the Tribunal to dismiss the petition.
On 5 February 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 rejecting the Petition on
the grounds of lack of consent of Churchill to join the Government of the Regency of East
Kutai to the proceedings.

On 22 November 2012, Indonesia filed a Request for Provisional Measures and a
Document Production Request in connection with jurisdiction. With regard to the Request
for Provisional Measures, Indonesia asked that Churchill refrain (i) from making false,
unfounded and misleading statements in the media regarding the case at hand, and
(ii) from approaching and/or persuading and/or inducing any officials of the Government of
the Republic of Indonesia to enter into amicable settlement outside the arbitral
proceedings. On 17 December 2012, Churchill filed its observations, which were followed
by Indonesia’s reply on 7 January 2013. On 21 January 2013, Churchill filed its rejoinder to
Indonesia's reply. In its decision of 4 March 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. 3 finding that the conditions for the recommendation of provisional measures were not
met, thus rejecting the provisional measures sought by Indonesia.

With respect to the Document Production Request, Churchill filed its Response to
Indonesia’s document request, whereby Churchill undertook to produce the requested
documents with its first memorial. After having heard the respective views of the Parties,
the Tribunal decided that Churchill should produce the requested documents together with
an explanatory note by 17 December 2012. On that date, Churchill submitted to Indonesia
all of the requested documents.

On 27 February 2013, Churchill submitted to the Tribunal an amended Request for
Arbitration purportedly adding PT Indonesia Coal Development (PT ICD) as a claimant in
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14. After having heard both Parties’ position at the 1 March 2013
common session (see below § 58), the Tribunal informed the Parties by letter of
4 March 2013 that the request was denied on the grounds of lack of consent of Indonesia
to join PT ICD to the proceedings.

2. Initiation of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40

On 4 October 2012, Planet Mining Pty Ltd sent a Notification of Dispute to the Republic of
Indonesia. On 26 November 2012, Planet then filed a Request for Arbitration with the
ICSID pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and the Australia-Indonesia BIT. On
26 December 2012, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered Planet's Request for
Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.

3. Consolidation

The Tribunal and the Parties in ICSID Cases No. ARB/12/14 and No. ARB/12/40 held a
common session by video link on 1 March 2013, which was sound and video recorded.
Besides serving as the first session in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40 pursuant to Rule 13 of
the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the common session addressed consolidation. Having
secured the agreement in principle of the Parties that the two disputes be heard in a
consolidated case,®° the Tribunal heard the Parties on the modalities of consolidation. The
Tribunal noted that the Parties agreed to join the two proceedings in all respects, but
disagreed on whether the Tribunal should render one joint decision/award in respect of
both Churchill and Planet or two separate decisions/awards, one in respect of each
claimant.

In Procedural Order No. 4 of 18 March 2013, the Tribunal confirmed the content of the
common session. With regard to the modalities of the consolidated proceedings, it decided
that the procedural calendar under Annex 3 to Procedural Order No. 1, amended by letter
of 21 February 2013 and supplemented by letter of 1 March 2013, would govern; that the
Tribunal’s orders issued as of the date of the common session would apply to all three

See, inter alia, Planet's letter of 4 October 2012; Churchill’s letter of 12 October 2012; and
Indonesia’s letter of 4 January 2013.

Parties, with the exception of Procedural Order No. 3 dealing with Indonesia’s request for
provisional measures in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14; that the Centre would maintain only
one case account; and that Mr. Magnus Jesko Langer would serve as assistant to the
Tribunal in the consolidated proceedings.

Further, the Tribunal noted that it would decide whether to render one or two awards at a
later stage, after consultation with the Parties.

WRITTEN PHASE ON JURISDICTION

In paragraph 14.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, as amended by the Tribunal’s letter of
21 February 2013, and recorded in Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal set the following
schedule for the jurisdictional phase:
(i) Churchill and Planet would file their Memorial by 13 March 2013;
(ii) | the Respondent would file its Objections to Jurisdiction by 8 April 2013;
(iii) Churchill and Planet would file their Response to the Objections to
Jurisdiction by 30 April 2013; and
(iv) the Respondent would file a Reply to the Response to the Objections to
Jurisdiction by 6 May 2013.

During the common session of 1 March 2013, the Respondent stated that it intended to
make additional document requests in connection with jurisdiction. After having heard the
views of Churchill and Planet, the Tribunal established the following schedule for document
production in a letter of 1 March 2013, confirmed in Procedural Order No. 4:

(i) the Respondent would file its Request by 6 March 2013;

(ii) | Churchill and Planet would state their Response to the Request and any
objections thereto by 11 March 2013;

(iii) the Respondent would respond to the aforementioned objections, if any, by
14 March 2013;

(iv) the Tribunal would rule on the objections, if any, by 19 March 2013; and

(v) Churchill and Planet would produce those documents for which no
objection has been sustained by the Tribunal by 22 March 2013.

63.

64.

65.

On 19 March 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 ruling on the objections to
the document production request submitted by Churchill and Planet. By letter of
22 March 2013, Churchill and Planet informed the Tribunal that they had sent hard copies
of all responsive documents in their possession at that time, and that they would adhere to
the continuing obligation under Procedural Order No. 5 to produce any outstanding final
awards or decisions, as specified in that Order, as soon as they become available.

On 13 March 2013, Churchill and Planet filed their Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits,
enclosing 348 exhibits and 69 legal exhibits. In the Request for Relief, Churchill requested
the following relief:

(i) a declaration that Indonesia had violated Article 5 of the UK-Indonesia BIT;
(ii) a declaration that Indonesia had violated Article 3 of the UK-Indonesia BIT;

(iii) an order directing Indonesia to pay monetary compensation or damages or
alternatively, full compensation for Churchill’s expenses — in each case in
amounts to be specified in the Claimant's forthcoming quantum
presentation — plus interest thereon, compounded quarterly, accruing at a
reasonable commercial rate per annum to be determined by the Tribunal,
from 4 May 2010 through to the date of payment;

(iv) an order directing Indonesia to pay all fees and costs incurred in connection
with the respective arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the
arbitrators and of ICSID as well as legal and other expenses incurred by
Churchill on a full indemnity basis, plus interest accrued thereupon at a rate
to be determined by the Tribunal from the date on which such costs are
incurred to the date of payment; and

(v) any other relief the Tribunal may deem just and appropriate.

On 8 April 2013, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, enclosing

101 exhibits and 77 legal exhibits. In the Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent

contends (i) that the “Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain [Churchill's] claims due to the

absence of any written consent by the Respondent to submit the dispute encompassed by
» 87

the Request[...] for Arbitration”,“’ and (ii) that “all of the claims asserted by [Churchill]
should be dismissed as [Churchill is] seeking the protection of the U.K.-Indonesia [...] [BIT]

RMOy, 255.

66.

67.

for investments which have not been admitted by the Republic of Indonesia and which,
consequently, fall outside the scope of protected investments under [this BIT]’.®° For these
reasons, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal:

(i) decline jurisdiction in the present case; and

(ii) order [Churchill] to pay the totality of costs relating to this Arbitration,
including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal,

Respondent's legal fees and all other amounts incurred by Respondent.®°

On 30 April 2013, the Churchill and Planet filed their Reply to Indonesia’s Objections to
Jurisdiction, enclosing 12 exhibits and 70 legal exhibits. The Reply was also accompanied
by the Second Expert Report of the Claimants’ expert on Indonesian law,
Dr. Nono A. Makarim. In their Response, Churchill and Planet requested that the Tribunal:

(i) Reject all jurisdictional objections raised by Indonesia; and

(ii) | Declare that it had jurisdiction under the UK-Indonesia BIT and the ICSID
Convention.

(iii) Order that Indonesia pay all fees and costs incurred in connection with the
arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and of ICSID
as well as legal and other expenses incurred by the Claimant on a full
indemnity basis, plus interest accrued thereon at a rate to be determined by
the Tribunal from the date on which such costs were incurred to the date of
payment; and

(iv) Award any other relief the Tribunal may deem just and appropriate.”
On 6 May 2013, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Objections to Jurisdiction, enclosing

9 exhibits and 28 legal exhibits. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent contended that the
Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to entertain the case because:

(i) The Respondent has not provided its consent in writing to submit the
disputes encompassed in the Requests for Arbitration to ICSID;

RMOJ, 256.
RMOJ, 4 257.
Reply, § 200.

20

Churchill’s alleged investments do not fall within the scope of investments
protected under the U.K.-Indonesia BIT, because (a) Churchill violated the
terms of the investment approvals by engaging in activities not
contemplated in the approvals, including using PT ICD as an investment
vehicle; (b) Churchill, in complete disregard of Indonesian laws prohibiting
PMA companies such as PT ICD to own shares or any interest in KP
Holders such as the Ridlatama Companies, entered into beneficial
ownership arrangements in order to circumvent that limitation, thereby
violating Article 1320 of the Civil Code and Article 33 of the 2007
Investment Law.*"

68. For these reasons, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to:

(i)

decline jurisdiction in the present case; and

order Churchill to pay the totality of costs relating to this Arbitration,
including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal, the
Respondent's legal fees and all other amounts incurred by the

Respondent.°?

On 8 May 2013, the Tribunal and the Parties held a pre-hearing telephone conference in
order to discuss outstanding matters related to the organization of the hearing on
jurisdiction. The telephone conference was audio-recorded. On the same day, the Tribunal
issued Procedural Order No. 6 containing the schedule of the hearing.

presented oral arguments on behalf of the Respondent.

During the morning session of the hearing on 13 May 2013, the Parties made short
opening statements, followed by the examination of Churchill's expert witness on
Indonesian law, Dr. Nono Makarim. In the afternoon, the Respondent then presented its
first round of oral arguments. During the morning session of the hearing on 14 May 2013,
Churchill presented its first round of oral arguments. In the afternoon, each Party, starting
with the Respondent, presented its second round of oral arguments.

The hearing was sound recorded. A verbatim transcript was produced and subsequently
distributed to the Parties.

PostT-HEARING PHASE

On 28 May 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 confirming that there would
be no post-hearing briefs, that corrections to the hearing transcript were due by
29 May 2013, that the Tribunal would decide on any disagreement between the Parties in
this respect, and that each Party was to submit its statement of costs by 5 June 2013,
allowing the other Party to comment by 12 June 2013. The Parties submitted their agreed
revisions to the hearing transcript on 29 May 2013.

In the course of its deliberations, the Tribunal identified several matters requiring further
submissions. On 22 July 2013, the Tribunal sent to the Parties a series of questions,
inviting them to respond simultaneously by 12 August 2013, and to comment, again
simultaneously, by 16 August 2013. On the Claimant’s request, the Tribunal postponed
these dates and the Parties filed their submissions on 23 and 30 August 2013.

Having deliberated, the Tribunal renders the present decision on jurisdiction. The
Tribunal will first summarize the positions of the Parties (Section IV), then analyze these
positions (Section V), and finally set out its decision on jurisdiction (Section VI).

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

In its written and oral submissions, Indonesia raised the following objections to the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal with regard to Churchill:

(i) Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT does not provide consent to ICSID
arbitration;

(ii) the BKPM approvals provided to PT ICD do not contain consent to ICSID
arbitration of the claims asserted by Churchill; and

(iii) the investment is not covered by Article 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT, as it
has not been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign
Capital Investment Law or any law amending or replacing it.

On the basis of these arguments, Indonesia invites the Tribunal to:

(i) decline jurisdiction in the present case; and

(ii) order Churchill to pay the totality of costs relating to this Arbitration,
including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal,
Respondent's legal fees and all other amounts incurred by Respondent.

THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION
In its written and oral submissions, the Claimant put forward the following main arguments:

(i) Indonesia consented to ICSID arbitration under the UK-Indonesia BIT;

(ii) in any event, the requirement of consent under the UK-Indonesia BIT is
fulfilled by way of the BKPM Approvals granted to PT ICD;

The Tribunal uses the term “jurisdiction” as referring to “the jurisdiction of the Centre” and “the
competence of the Tribunal” (see Art. 41(2) of the ICSID Convention).

25

80.

81.

82.

(iii) the investment has been admitted in accordance with the 1967 Foreign
Capital Investment Law or any law amending or replacing it.

On the basis of these contentions, Churchill Mining Plc requests the Tribunal to:

1) Reject all jurisdictional objections raised by Indonesia; and

2) Declare that it has jurisdiction under the UK-Indonesia BIT and the ICSID
Convention.

3) | Order that Indonesia pay all fees and costs incurred in connection with the
arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and of ICSID
as well as legal and other expenses incurred by the Claimant on a full
indemnity basis, plus interest accrued thereupon at a rate to be determined
by the Tribunal from the date on which such costs are incurred to the date
of payment; and

4) — Award any other relief the Tribunal deems just and appropriate.

ANALYSIS

The Tribunal will first address a number of preliminary matters (A) before it enters into the
analysis of the jurisdictional objections (B and C).

PRELIMINARY MATTERS

1. One or two decisions/awards?

At the common session during which consolidation of the proceedings before the Tribunal
was agreed, the Respondent indicated a preference for a single decision/award, while
Churchill and Planet asked for two separate decisions/awards. The issue was left open
and Procedural Order No. 4, issued after the common session, states that the Tribunal
would resolve it after further consultation with the Parties.“ At the hearing, the Tribunal
again requested the Parties’ views.°° The Respondent reiterated its preference for a single
decision/award, and stated that “Planet is controlled by Churchill Mining and the claims are
the same, so the fact that there are two different bilateral investment treaties is really

Procedural Order No. 4, § 1.3.4.

26

83.

84.

85.

irrelevant for us. So we would like the tribunal just to render one award or one decision on
jurisdiction”.°° Churchill and Planet, for their part, maintained their prior position and stated
that “the earlier position we articulated was that we encouraged the efficiencies to be
gained by having single hearings in respect of the two cases and that we sought separate
awards, and that remains our position”.°”

The Tribunal is of the view that it must respect the modalities of consolidation agreed by
the Parties. The Parties have agreed to consolidate the two arbitrations for all purposes
including the conduct of the proceedings and the case account, with the exception of the
decisions/awards. Absent consent in this latter respect, the Tribunal considers that it lacks
the power to issue a joint decision or award. Hence, the Tribunal will render two separate
decisions, the first and present one concerning Churchill (original ICSID Case
No. ARB/12/14) and the second one concerning Planet (original ICSID Case
No. ARB/12/40).

2. The relevance of previous ICSID decisions or awards

In support of their positions, the Parties relied on previous ICSID decisions or awards,
either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case or in an
effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.

The Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions.* At the same time, it is
of the opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international
tribunals. Specifically, it deems that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty
to adopt solutions established in a series of consistent cases. It further deems that, subject
to the specific provisions of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case, it
has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law, with a view to
meeting the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards
certainty of the rule of law.

Tr. 14052013, 155:7-12.

Tr. 14052013, 166:6-10.

In its Reply, § 173, the Claimant indicates that “investor-state jurisprudence, which constitutes non-
binding but persuasive authority [constitutes] therefore appropriate ‘supplementary means of
interpretation’ under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention”. In its Rejoinder, § 18, the Respondent
states that “scholarly commentary constitutes a ‘subsidiary means for the determination of rules of
law’ in international law (Art. 38(1)(d) of the ICJ Statute)”. In a footnote, Rejoinder, J 18, n. 45, the
Respondent adds that “[t]his is true as well for the reasoning of the tribunal in Millicom”, infra note
115. See also: Tr. 13052013, 139:22-140:16.

3. Legal framework

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is contingent upon the provisions of the ICSID Convention on
the one hand, and of the UK-Indonesia BIT,°° on the other hand. In addition, where an
international law instrument refers to jurisdictional requirements governed by the municipal
law of a Contracting State, that municipal law shall also govern the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal to the extent provided by the BIT.

3.1. Jurisdictional requirements under the ICSID Convention
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention reads in relevant part as follows:

“The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising

directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State [...] anda

national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute

consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have

given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally”.
Accordingly, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides for four requirements for
jurisdiction. There must be (i) a dispute between a Contracting State and a national of
another Contracting State,’ (ii) of a legal nature, (iii) arising directly from an

investment,'®' and (iv) the Parties must have consented in writing to arbitration.

There is no dispute on the first three requirements and rightly so. Indeed, the Tribunal is
satisfied that these requirements are met. By contrast, there is a dispute about the fourth
requirement, Indonesia arguing in its first jurisdictional objection that it has not consented
to submit the present dispute to ICSID arbitration.

3.2 Jurisdictional requirements under the BIT
Article 7(1) of the BIT provides the following:

The Contracting Party in the territory of which a national or company
of the other Contracting Party makes or intends to make an
investment shall assent to any request on the part of such national or
company to submit, for conciliation or arbitration, to the Centre

Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments,

established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment

Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States opened for

signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 any dispute that may

arise in connection with the investment.
It is undisputed that Indonesia is a Contracting Party of the BIT, and that Churchill qualifies
as a “national or company of the other Contracting Party”, i.e. of the United Kingdom. It is
equally undisputed that Churchill has made an investment in the territory of Indonesia, and
that the dispute arises in connection with the investment.

It is further common ground that Article 2(1) of the BIT spells out an additional requirement
for jurisdiction, namely that the investment must “have been granted admission in
accordance with the Foreign Capital Investment Law No. 1 of 1967 or any law amending or
replacing it”. It does so in the following terms:

This Agreement shall only apply to investments of nationals or
companies of the United Kingdom in the territory of the Republic of
Indonesia which have been granted admission in accordance with the
Foreign Capital Investment Law No. 1 of 1967 or any law amending
or replacing it.
In this latter respect, the Tribunal notes that the Foreign Capital Investment Law No. 1 of
1967 (“1967 Foreign Investment Law”) was amended by Law No. 11 of 1970, and
replaced on 26 April 2007 by Law No. 25 of 2007 concerning Investment (“2007
Investment Law”).'°°
The Parties diverge on the fulfillment of the requirement spelled out under Article 2(1),
which is the object of Indonesia’s second jurisdictional objection.

3.3 Rules for treaty interpretation

The ICSID Convention and the BIT must be interpreted pursuant to the rules of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) which codifies customary international law. The
Tribunal expands on such rules in its analysis below.

Law No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (Exh. CLA-2).
Law No. 25 on Investment (2007) (Exh. CLA-4).

3.4 Test for jurisdiction

At the jurisdictional stage, the Claimant must establish (i) that the jurisdictional
requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and of the Treaty are met, which
includes proving the facts necessary to meet these requirements, and (ii) that it has a
prima facie cause of action under the Treaty, that is, that the facts it alleges are susceptible
of constituting a breach of the Treaty if they are ultimately proven. The Tribunal finds that
this test strikes a proper balance between a more exacting standard which would call for
examination of the merits at the jurisdictional stage, and a less exacting standard which
would confer excessive weight to the Claimant’s own characterization of its claims.

FIRST OBJECTION: CONSENT

1. The Respondent's Position

Indonesia challenges jurisdiction on the ground that it has not consented to ICSID
jurisdiction under the UK-Indonesia BIT. Bearing in mind the fundamental requirement of
State consent under international law (1.1. below) and the general rules of treaty
interpretation (1.2. below), Indonesia argues in essence that Article 7(1) of the Uk-
Indonesia BIT does not provide consent to ICSID arbitration with respect to Churchill's
claims (1.3. below). More specifically, Indonesia contends that the “shall assent” clause
contained in Article 7(1) does not constitute consent for purposes of the ICSID Convention
and the BIT, and that a subsequent act is required to achieve consent. In this case,
Indonesia has not performed such subsequent act thereby exercising a Treaty-based right
(1.4. below). In this respect, it also contends that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to assess
whether Indonesia legitimately withheld its consent. Finally, Indonesia submits that the
BKPM approvals granted to PT ICD do not encompass Indonesia's consent to ICSID
arbitration of the claims asserted by Churchill (1.5. below), and that, in any event, they do
not extend to Churchill (1.6. below).

1.1. State consent is a fundamental requirement under international law

Indonesia recalls that the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals is based on the
consent of States, and that various ICSID tribunals have described consent as the

30

99.

S

cornerstone of the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals.'°* State consent cannot be presumed; it
must be established by definitive evidence. '° In the framework of ICSID, “consent must be

supplied by a written manifestation of consent”. '°°

1.2 The rules on treaty interpretation as reflected in the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties

Indonesia argues that Article 7(1) must be interpreted in accordance with Articles 31-33 of
the VCLT. In this respect, Indonesia puts emphasis on the ordinary meaning of the
provision; a holistic approach, considering the object and purpose of the BIT, would not
justify disregarding the words themselves.'”” Indonesia also claims that “interpretation of a
treaty cannot amount to its revision”.'® Finally, for Indonesia, the Tribunal should apply the
principle of contemporaneity and determine the original will of the Contracting States,
instead of adopting an evolutionary interpretation of the dispute settlement clause
contained in the BIT.

1.3 Article 7(1) of the BIT does not provide consent

Indonesia submits that the “shall assent” clause in Article 7(1) does not provide “automatic”
consent to ICSID arbitration. For consent to be established, the State must perform a
further act following the submission of a request by a claimant. In support of this position,
the Respondent advances essentially six arguments: first, the ordinary meaning of “shall
assent” is clear - it requires an additional act of consent; second, the structure of the UK-
Indonesia BIT, in particular the link between Articles 7(1) and 2(1), confirms the ordinary
meaning of “shall assent”; third, the object and purpose of a treaty cannot defeat its plain
language; fourth, particular attention must be paid to the principle of contemporaneity; fifth,

doctrinal writings support Indonesia’s understanding of Article 7(1); and sixth, no relevance
should be attributed to the Millicom decision.

. First and foremost, Indonesia argues that the ordinary meaning of the “shall assent” clause

in Article 7(1) of the BIT cannot be understood as conferring automatic jurisdiction to the
Tribunal, it is a pactum de contrahendo whereby the Contracting State must and can only
give its consent after the filing of a request by a qualifying investor.'®

According to Indonesia, the “shall assent” clause requires a further declaration on the part
of Indonesia."’® The clause merely requires a Contracting Party to the BIT to give its
assent to ICSID arbitration after having been requested to do so by a qualifying investor.
Indonesia contrasts the “shall assent” clause with the “hereby consents” clause found in
the UK Model BIT. The latter provides for ex ante consent, while the former envisages ex
post consent.'"*

. According to Indonesia, the “shall assent” clause presumes a sequence “in which the

investor first makes a request to which the host state is expected to assent”.'* Therefore,
in the absence of a subsequent declaration, the Tribunal cannot but deny its jurisdiction.

Second, the structure of the BIT with respect to the “shall assent” clause and the link to
other jurisdictional requirements confirms Indonesia's position.

. For the Respondent, Article 7(1) institutes a two-step procedure allowing Indonesia to

refuse to consent if other jurisdictional requirements are not fulfilled,'’® in particular, if the
investment has not been granted admission in accordance with Indonesia's Foreign
Investment Capital Law as required by Article 2(1) of the BIT.'"*

In this context, Indonesia distinguishes Millicom v. Senegal to which we will revert
below.'"® It also relies on Desert Line v. Yemen, where the tribunal held that some States
“require that investors wishing to be protected must identify themselves, on the footing that
only specifically approved investments will give rise to benefits under the relevant

treaty”.''® The tribunal, which expressly referred to the UK-Indonesia BIT,"'” went on to
state that “[t]his is a different approach, but it too has a legitimate policy rationale, in the
sense that the Governments of such States evidently wish to exercise a qualitative control
on the types of investments which are indeed to be promoted and protected”. '"®

Third, Indonesia contends that “an interpretation based upon the object and purpose
cannot go against the plain language of the treaty”.''? It submits that the encouragement
and protection of foreign investments is not the sole object and purpose of the BIT and that
a “State may balance the policy of encouraging investment by investors of the other State
party to the BIT with other policies or considerations, one of which may be to preserve the
ability to avoid ICSID arbitration of disputes relating to investments outside the protection
of the BIT in question”.'?° The screening of foreign investments is a legitimate policy which
is reflected in the drafting of Article 7(1) of the Treaty.

. The Respondent further argues that, even if the object and purpose of the BIT were limited

to the encouragement and protection of foreign investments, it cannot defeat the clear
language of the “shall assent” clause. '*' In support, Indonesia in particular quotes the Iran-
US Claims Tribunal, which held that “[t]he object and purpose is not to be considered in
isolation from the terms of the treaty; it is intrinsic to its text. It follows that, under Article 31
of the Vienna Convention, a treaty’s object and purpose is to be used only to clarify the
text, not to provide independent sources of meaning that contradict the clear text”.'®* In
connection with the relationship between the object and purpose of an investment treaty
and the dispute settlement clause more specifically, Indonesia refers to the tribunal in
Telenor Mobile v. Hungary, which stressed that its task was “to interpret the BIT [...], not to
displace, by reference to general policy considerations concerning investor protection, the

dispute resolution mechanism specifically negotiated by the parties”. '*°

Fourth, although unqualified direct consent to ICSID jurisdiction may not be exceptional
anymore in today’s times, Indonesia submits that such consent was rather uncommon in
the 1970s. Therefore, the principle of contemporaneity must apply in order to assess the
real intent of the Contracting States at the time of the conclusion of the BIT in 1976." In
support of this proposition, Indonesia invokes the comments of the UK Foreign and
Commonwealth Office on the UK Draft Model BIT which contains a “hereby consents”
clause, but recognize that prospective signatories “may wish to reserve themselves the

right to decide in the case of each individual dispute whether they are prepared to have

referred to the Centre for arbitration”. '°

Fifth, Indonesia claims that there is virtual unanimity among commentators for its view of
the “shall assent” clause. It finds support from the authors who directly refer to the UK-

Indonesia BIT,'° from those commenting on similar provisions in other treaties,'®” and

from those making general comments on instruments providing for future consent. '®

the investor with an immediate right to resort to international arbitration.

Sixth and last, the Respondent seeks to distinguish Millicom v. Senegal.’ There, the
Tribunal found that nothing in the wording of the “shall assent” clause in the Netherlands-
Senegal BIT “leads to the conclusion that such decision could be left up to the discretion of
the State”, and held that “it is more reasonable to view this as a unilateral offer and a
commitment by Senegal to submit itself to ICSID jurisdiction”."°° Indonesia contends that
“the Millicom decision can hardly be taken as a persuasive authority, let alone one having
conclusively settled the issue”.'*"

Specifically, Indonesia argues that Millicom does not apply to the present case for the
following reasons: (i) the Millicom tribunal reached its conclusion without discussing any of
the doctrinal writings referred to above; (ii) commentators have criticized the Millicom
decision as being “debatable”, “inconsistent with the clear and unambiguous treaty

arbitration by stating that the host state ‘shall consent’ to arbitration in the event of a dispute”);

University Press, 2010), p. 434 (Exh. RLA-040) (“Some BITs provide that, in the event of an

language”, and “contrary to the letter of the treaty”; (iii) the Millicom tribunal's interpretation
amounts to treaty revision; (iv) its methodology is fundamentally flawed as it allows the
alleged purpose of the treaty to override the plain text; (v) unlike Senegal, Indonesia does
not argue that it has discretion to consent or not to a request submitted by an investor.
Rather, it claims that it exercised its right to withhold its consent; and (vi) the structure of
the BIT, reflecting the “approved investment” approach, is markedly different from the
Netherlands-Senegal BIT, which requires that the investment be “in accordance with local

law’.

1.4 Indonesia legitimately exercised its treaty-based right to withhold consent

Article 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT limits protection to investments that have been
granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law or any law
amending or replacing it.'** Indonesia considers that Churchill's investment does not meet
this requirement, thus justifying its refusal to arbitrate the present dispute.

In any event, the Tribunal could not accept jurisdiction on the ground that Indonesia’s
refusal to give consent is illegal, as this would “put the cart before the horse”. '®* Indeed,
the Tribunal must have jurisdiction to be able to rule on the legality of Indonesia’s
omission. Indonesia further asserts that any challenge of its refusal is subject to the State-
to-State dispute resolution mechanism provided in the BIT. In other words, this Tribunal is
the wrong tribunal and the Claimant is the wrong party for that hypothetical dispute. '**

1.5 The BKPM approvals granted to PT ICD do not contain consent to ICSID
arbitration of Churchill's claims

Indonesia notes further that Churchill did not rely on the BKPM approvals in its Request for
Arbitration; it relied exclusively on the BIT as the source of Indonesia's consent.‘

PT ICD as another claimant demonstrates that Churchill knows well that consent is lacking
under the BIT and that the BKPM approvals only cover PT ICD, not Churchill.'*°

More specifically, Indonesia submits that Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM approval does
not constitute consent to ICSID arbitration, because (i) the BKPM does not have authority
to grant consent to ICSID arbitration, (ii) the wording of Section IX(4) does not include
consent on the part of Indonesia, because the word bersedia means “is prepared/ready”'*”
and not “is willing” as proposed by the Claimant;'* (iii) in any case, Section IX(4) of the
2005 BKPM approval only extends to PT ICD and not to the Claimant, '* and (iv) the UK-
Indonesia BIT only contemplates consent given by Indonesia after the request has been
submitted to ICSID, as opposed to consent given through an instrument drafted in 2005. '*°

At the hearing, the Respondent argued that only the President of the Republic can validly
grant consent to arbitrate under ICSID and that the authority delegated to the BKPM does
not encompass the power to agree to ICSID arbitration.’ Had the BKPM given
Indonesia's consent to ICSID arbitration:

“That would be a transgression of authority if you treated what BKPM
said in paragraph 9(4) as a consent. If you treated it as you mention
it, willingness or preparedness to follow, then it will not. Because once
the dispute arises, then BKPM will help the investors to go back to the

one who has the authority to give us consent”.

Thus, according to Indonesia, the BKPM’s “preparedness” can only be interpreted as
meaning that, if an investor raises a dispute with the BKPM or any other agency of the
Government, such as the Ministry of Mining, then the BKPM would act as an intermediary
to “assist the investors to go back to the one who holds the authority”, i.e. the President of
the Republic. '*°

At the hearing, a member of the Tribunal asked the Respondent whether it could point to
any Indonesian law or regulation prohibiting the BKPM to give consent to ICSID arbitration.

The Respondent answered that the question should be put differently. As Article 2 of Law
No. 5 of 1968, '“* read in combination with the Indonesian constitution, ® provides that only
the Government, i.e. the President, has the authority to grant ICSID consent, it should be
explored whether there is a law or regulation delegating such authority to the BKPM:

“[Tribunal:] The real question is, if you want to say that BKPM has no
authority to give this consent to ICSID dispute resolution, then can
you ask — I’ve asked Dr. Makarim whether he is aware of any law that
prevents them from giving that assent or that consent and he says he
is not. So if you are aware of some law that does constrain BKPM’s
powers in regard to saying what they said in 9(4), then why don’t you
put it to Dr. Makarim?

[Respondent:] Okay. Because the way | want to ask is different than
the way what you just mentioned. You are coming from whether there
is any law restricting constraining but this is not the way it works. It
should be whether there is any law giving authority to BKPM in
granting the consent required under the ICSID Conventions where
our law number 5 1968, on the ratification of the ICSID Convention,
article 2 clearly stipulate that that authority to give consent is with the
government, and based on our constitutions that government is solely
represented by the president and then of course it is the president
then whether or not he wants to delegate”. '“°

121. With regard to the wording of Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval, the Respondent

argues that the word bersedia, even if it means “willingness” or “preparedness”, “fails to
express anything more than a predisposition or openness to pursue settlement in
accordance with the provisions of the ICSID Convention”."*’ In this context, Indonesia
criticizes Churchill for relying merely on Dr. Makarim who adopts a literal translation of the
word bersedia.'“° Dr. Makarim makes no effort to argue that Section IX(4) contains
Indonesia’s consent, as opposed to a mere disposition to pursue a settlement. '*° Nor does
Dr. Makarim provide an opinion on the delegation of authority to the BKPM or on the
extension of Section IX(4) to PT ICD’s shareholders. '®°

Responding to the Claimant's reliance on Amco, Indonesia asserts that such decision is
inapposite as the dispute settlement provisions are different. The provision in Amco
contained definitive language of approval, while Section IX(4) contains “no explicit

commitment to pursue a settlement through arbitration”. '*"

1.6 Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM approval, in connection with the 2006 BKPM
approval, does not extend to Churchill

Indonesia contends that both Churchill and Planet knew that the dispute settlement clause
in Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM does not encompass disputes with
PT ICD’s shareholders. Indeed, none of the Requests for Arbitration referred to the 2005
BKPM Approval as source of Indonesia’s consent; they only relied on the BITs. In any
event, the wording of Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval shows that it only covers
disputes with PT ICD."®* The word “perusahaan” is correctly translated as “company’”, i.e.
PT ICD, and not as “business” as contended by the Claimant. **

2. The Claimant’s Position

In addition to stressing that it is an investor and that all other jurisdictional requirements are
met,'®* the Claimant submits that Indonesia has consented to ICSID arbitration under the
BIT (2.1. through 2.5. below). However, in the event that the Tribunal were to hold that the
BIT requires additional consent, Churchill submits that Indonesia has provided such
consent by issuing the BKPM Approvals (2.6. below).

In its written submissions and at the hearing, the Claimant identified Indonesia’s
submissions and evidence which, in its view, have no bearing on jurisdiction. "> These
include (i) whether the Claimant's initial interest was in East Kutai or Sendawar; (ii) its
allegedly misleading public announcements; (iii) Indonesia’s allegation that the Claimant
misled its investors; and (iv) Indonesia’s “aspersion” on the character of the Claimant's
witness, Mr. Quinlivan.

arbitration. It essentially expands on its position in four steps. First, it outlines the relevant
rules on treaty interpretation (2.2. below); second, it discusses its main contention
according to which the words “shall assent” provide automatic consent to ICSID arbitration
upon filing of the Request for Arbitration (2.3. below); third, it disputes Indonesia’s reliance
on the principle of contemporaneity (2.4. below); and fourth, it challenges the impact of
various authorities cited by the Respondent (2.5. below).

2.2 Treaty interpretation rules

In connection with treaty interpretation, the Claimant summarized at the hearing its position
with regard to the relevant dispute settlement clause as follows:

“Did the drafters intend that the words “shall assent”, far from creating
certainty, would actually introduce some sort of an option for a state
to breach the treaty and prevent resolution of a dispute in a neutral
forum? Plainly, they did not. That would be contrary to the object and
purpose of the treaty, contrary to the stated desire to achieve
certainty and security for investors, contrary to good faith
interpretation of treaties [...], and also contrary to the obligation to
perform treaties in good faith”. '®

According to Churchill, there is a hierarchy between the general rule of interpretation under
Article 31 VCLT and recourse to supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32
VCLT.'®’ Supplementary means can only come into play if the meaning of the terms is not
clear.’ The interpretation must therefore begin with the language and ensure that the
meaning of the Treaty’s terms is consistent with the rest of the Treaty, including the
preamble and annexes and the specific materials listed under Article 31(2)(a)-(b) and
31(3)(a)-(c) of the VCLT.'

2.3 “Shall assent” provides automatic consent

Churchill disputes Indonesia's interpretation of the terms “shall assent”, arguing that
Indonesia’s proposed solution of diplomatic protection runs counter to the modern investor-
state system and that it would leave the Claimant de facto without recourse.’ The
ordinary meaning of “shall” denotes a binding obligation; it does not provide Indonesia with
an “option to veto”."®' The ‘shall assent” wording suggests the opposite of an option. The
drafters inserted the word “shall” to implement certainty, not to grant the Respondent
discretion.‘

Responding to a question from the Tribunal, the Claimant stated at the hearing that the
meaning of “assent” was different from the one of “consent”. ® It does not seem, however,
that Churchill drew any conclusion from this difference. It argued that “[clonsent exists
without any further act required of Indonesia beyond the language of the treaties. Any
other finding would fly in the face of common sense, ignore the undoubted intention of the

drafters of both treaties and lead to palpably absurd results”. '®

. Churchill claims that its interpretation of “shall assent” is also supported by the object and

purpose of the BIT, which is to create favorable conditions for investments by nationals
and companies of one State in the territory of the other State.'®°

“To answer your question, is there a distinction between “consent” and “assent”? Yes, there is.
There is a difference. “Assent” means something different” (Tr. 14052013, 61:2-6). And the
Claimant went on:

“[Claimant:] Let's look at what assent means, as you have asked. Black’s Law Dictionary, which
we've already seen, it’s on the record, “assent”, agreement approval or permission, especially
verbal or nonverbal conduct reasonably interpreted as willingness. The Oxford Dictionary of English,
the expression of approval. There is, we say, a distinction, perhaps a fine one, but there is a
distinction between “assent” and “consent”. Verbal or nonverbal conduct reasonably interpreted as
willingness will suffice.

[Tribunal:]. Are you saying that all assents are consents and not the other way around?

[Claimant:] At first blush, sir, that seems right, but I'd like to think about that question and come back
to you, if | have anything further to add”.

It does not appear, however, that the Claimant drew conclusions from this difference (Tr. 14052013,
63:19-64:9).

Similarly, relying on Millicom, the Claimant explains that Indonesia’s interpretation is
contrary to the “clear intent” of the drafters of the treaty.'® It is also irreconcilable with the
obligation to interpret treaty provisions in good faith, which cannot permit “a State to violate
its treaty obligations at will”.'®’ Churchill further argues that, if a text has two possible
meanings, then good faith interpretation “requires the interpreter to prefer the ‘better faith’
interpretation consistent with the object and purpose of the treaty and the presumption that
States mean what they say” when ratifying a treaty. '®°

The Claimant seeks to substantiate its interpretation of the terms “shall assent” by relying
on the Millicom decision." In that case, the arbitral tribunal was faced with a provision in
the Netherlands-Senegal BIT similar to the one at issue here and held that nothing in the
wording of the term “shall assent” would lead to the conclusion that such decision could be
left to the discretion of the host State.'”° It decided that the dispute settlement clause
contained Senegal’s unilateral offer of consent, which was accepted by the filing of the
investor's request.

Relying on explanatory notes of the Dutch Foreign Ministry on similar “shall assent”
wording in various agreements entered into by the Netherlands,'’' the Claimant argues
that the UK-Indonesia BIT seeks to offer investors certainty in terms of recourse to
arbitration.’

2.4 Indonesia’s reliance on the principle of contemporaneity is misleading

As a threshold matter, the Claimant stresses that the principle of contemporaneity must be
applied with restraint, as it is not part of the rules on interpretation of the VCLT.'

In any event, the interpretation of the terms “shall assent” proposed by the Claimant with
regard to the UK-Indonesia BIT is consistent with the original will of the drafters in 1976.

They intended to express in mandatory terms the certainty that investors would have
access to ICSID proceedings.’

Furthermore, Indonesia’s understanding of the principle of contemporaneity is misleading.
The VCLT leaves the door open for evolutive interpretation so as to render the terms of a
treaty effective in the light of changing circumstances. '”®

In the present instance, the terms “shall assent” must be read bearing in mind subsequent
practice; it must be interpreted “within the framework of the entire legal system prevailing
at the time of interpretation”, ie. in essence the system of arbitration without privity. '”°
Proceeding in this manner could result in a departure from the original intent of the parties

to the BIT.

2.5 Indonesia’s reliance on various commentators is erroneous

Indonesia's reliance on doctrinal writings which observe that there is a “virtual unanimity”
among commentators about the interpretation of “shall assent” is “misleading in its breadth

and mistaken in its content”.'’”

The Claimant starts by calling attention to the fact that Indonesia's interpretation of “shall
assent” is not substantiated by any travaux préparatoires relating to Indonesia’s own
treaties.'® Nor do the commentators cited by Indonesia rely on preparatory materials
relating to the negotiation or conclusion of the UK-Indonesia BIT.'””

. Churchill further points out that most commentators referred to by Indonesia uncritically

rely on Aron Broches’ analysis, who himself cites nothing in support of his view.

“citation chain” dating back to Broches,"®° that interpretation has become “conventional
wisdom”. That wisdom is no evidence of the intent of the drafters. '°"

2.6 Indonesia has provided its consent under the BKPM Approvals

Should the Tribunal find that the UK-Indonesia BIT requires an additional act of consent,
Churchill argues that the Respondent has given such consent in the 2005 BKPM Approval.
This consent was transferred to the Claimant upon its acquisition of PT ICD and through
the 2006 BKPM Approval, which validated the acquisition of PT ICD and incorporated the
2005 BKPM Approval.

The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's contention that the BKPM Approvals only
extend to PT ICD and not to its shareholders. Relying on Noble Energy v. Ecuador, the
Claimant disputes that the Respondent granted its consent only to PT ICD “when the only
manner in which that company could benefit from such consent would be under investment
treaties [...] to which it would resort by virtue of its foreign ownership”. "©?

The Claimant further relies on Amco v. Indonesia and Holiday Inns v. Morocco for the
proposition that a host State’s consent contained in domestic instruments, such as
contracts concluded with or licenses granted to local subsidiaries, extends to the foreign
investors insofar as they carry out their obligations under the contract.'® The Claimant
argues that it is the driving force behind PT ICD’s activities and that it funded these
activities allocating resources, contacts and expertise in developing the EKCP project.
Therefore, it is “reasonable to interpret the ICSID consent granted by the Respondent as
intended to protect its rights as investor as well, especially since they overlap almost
entirely with those of PT ICD”. ®*

The Claimant also seeks support in the expert report of Dr. Makarim, who opines that the
inclusion of ICSID dispute settlement clauses in the BKPM approvals is “not standard”'®®

and “not at all consistent practice of BKPM”.'® In spite of a divergent practice, reference to
ICSID dispute settlement was expressly included here and granted to a local company that
was in foreign hands at 95% from its inception and at 100% since the Claimants’
acquisition. For these reasons, Dr. Makarim is of the view that the “deliberate insertion of
the clause must be interpreted as the Government's intention to follow the [ICSID]
Convention’s dictates in settling disputes”.'°”

With regard to the wording of Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval, the Claimant
translates the Indonesian word bersedia as “is willing”.'®® On that basis, the Claimant
submits that the “shall assent” requirement under the UK-Indonesia BIT is fulfilled. '®° It
also refutes the Respondent's allegation that the BKPM lacked authority to agree to ICSID
arbitration, pointing to the fact that the BKPM Approval was copied to the President's office
and various other Ministries.'°° Had the BKPM overstepped its authority, the President
would presumably have taken appropriate action.

Finally, with regard to Indonesia’s argument that the BIT only considers consent given by
the host State after the request for arbitration has been filed by a qualifying investor, thus
giving the host State the right to refuse to grant its consent on a case by case basis, the
Claimant argues that no provision in the BIT prevents either State party to provide its
consent in advance such as through the BKPM Approvals. '*'

3. Analysis

3.1 Consent to ICSID arbitration in general

Article 25 of the ICSID Convention requires consent for the Parties to be bound to arbitrate

under the ICSID regime. Several arbitral tribunals have taken the position that the

expression of consent to ICSID arbitration must be “clear and unambiguous”,'® or that

consent must be proven through “affirmative evidence”.'** Except for calling for a writing,
the ICSID Convention contains no particular requirement of clarity or otherwise. Hence, the
Tribunal will assess consent pursuant to the general rules on treaty interpretation.

3.2 The Tribunal’s interpretative approach

The interpretation of the UK-Indonesia BIT is governed by Articles 31-32 of the Vienna

Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT),'®* which codify customary international law. '°°

When interpreting the BIT and seeking to assess the common intention of the Contracting
States, account must be taken of the special nature of investor-State arbitration, namely
that the home State of the investor is not a party to the arbitration. It does not have the
opportunity to present its views on the interpretation of “its” treaty nor to produce evidence
in support, unlike the host State. This asymmetry inherent in investment treaty arbitration
may justify recourse to the Tribunal’s procedural powers under Rules 34 and 37 of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules.

. According to Article 31 VCLT, a treaty must be interpreted “in good faith in accordance with

the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light
of its object and purpose”. No special rule applies to the interpretation of a dispute
settlement provision. Hence, such treaty provisions must be construed like any other,
neither restrictively nor broadly. Or in the words of Amco:

construed restrictively, nor, as a matter of fact, broadly or liberally. It

is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the

application of the fundamental principle pacta sunt servanda, a

principle common, indeed, to all systems of internal law and to

international law”'®.

purpose implies that recourse to extrinsic evidence is only allowed in limited
circumstances. Pursuant to Article 32, one may resort to supplementary means of
interpretation (i) to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31, or (ii) to
determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31 “leaves the meaning
ambiguous or obscure”, or (iii) “leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or
unreasonable”. In H/CEE, the tribunal noted that supplementary means are not a closed
category.'°

155. Indonesia submits that it has not consented to ICSID arbitration, and that Article 7(1) of the

15

@

N

UK-Indonesia BIT cannot be construed as a standing offer to arbitrate. It merely constitutes
a promise to consent. Indonesia also submits that the BKPM Approvals do not express
consent to ICSID arbitration.

The Tribunal will first determine whether the UK-Indonesia BIT contains a standing offer of
ICSID arbitration and will only analyze whether the BKPM Approvals contain consent to
ICSID arbitration if it reaches a negative conclusion in respect of the
Uk-Indonesia BIT.

3.4 The ordinary meaning of the words “shall assent”

It is Indonesia’s main contention that it did not “assent” to Churchill’s Request for
Arbitration, and that therefore this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. According to Indonesia,
Article 7(1) contemplates a two-step process in which the foreign investor submits a
request for arbitration and Indonesia then gives its consent.* The natural and ordinary
meaning of “shall assent” implies a future action.

Indonesia has not developed specific arguments on the meaning of “assent” and on the
distinction between “assent” and “consent”. Instead, Indonesia sought to ascertain the
ordinary meaning of the words “shall assent” taken together. According to Indonesia, “shall
assent” signifies that a separate, subsequent act of consent by the host State is called for
each time a qualifying investor seeks to engage in ICSID arbitration. Article 7(1) only
encompasses a promise to consent, a so-called pactum de contrahendo.

158. Indonesia acknowledges that in principle it is required to grant its consent.*"' It submits,

15:

S

however, that it is entitled to review on a case-by-case basis whether the jurisdictional
requirements set in the treaty are fulfilled as a prerequisite for its decision to give consent.
In particular, Indonesia argues that there is a link between Articles 7(1) and 2(1) of the
treaty.”°? Accordingly, it is required to give its consent only if it is established (after the filing
of the request for arbitration) that the investment at issue was granted admission as
required under Article 2(1) of the BIT. Since Churchill failed to conform to the requirements
of Article 2(1), Indonesia is entitled to withhold its consent. In any event, even if the
Tribunal were to find that the Article 2(1) objection is ill-founded, the Tribunal would
nevertheless lack jurisdiction, because Indonesia has not given its consent. In this
context, Indonesia submits that the inter-State dispute settlement mechanism enshrined in
Article 8 of the Treaty was specifically designed to address whether a host State is bound
to grant its consent or whether it is justified to withhold it.°*

For its part, Churchill argues that the formula “shall assent” in and of itself fulfills the
requirement of consent by the host State under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. There
is no further action required from the host State after the filing of the request for arbitration.
The ordinary meaning of the word “shall” denotes a legally binding obligation. In other
words, “[flar from signifying an option, it is an expression of a mandatory obligation”.”°° It
was thus the clear intent of the treaty drafters to provide investors with the certainty of
access to ICSID arbitration.

Until the hearing, the Claimant seemed to assume that “assent” and “consent” were
synonyms. Relying on various dictionary definitions, Churchill put forward that “assent”
signifies “verbal or nonverbal conduct reasonably interpreted as willingness” or “expression
of approval’.? Even at the hearing, the Claimant did not appear to draw clear-cut
conclusions from the use of different words. Its arguments about this distinction rather
concerned the question whether the BKPM Approvals contained an expression of
consent.” For the Claimant, were the Tribunal to find that an additional act is required

under Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT, such “assent” could readily be found in the
BKPM approvals.

. A closer look at the Claimant’s submissions reveals that, in reality, the Claimant has put

forward two different lines of reasoning. The first one works on the assumption that Article
7(1) already encompasses the necessary advance consent, conceptualized as an offer to
arbitrate, which is accepted by the investor when filing of the request for arbitration. In
sum, the Claimant seems to argue that “shall assent” is the functional equivalent of “hereby
consents” or of “shall be bound to submit”.*°° The Claimant's second line of reasoning
assumes that the investor's request for arbitration contains the offer to arbitrate, which
offer is automatically met by the consent of the host State without any need of further
action by that State.?°°

The core disagreement between the Parties hinges on the meaning of the words “shall
assent”. It is common ground, and rightly so, that the word “shall” implies an obligation.
This would suggest that the submission to ICSID on the part of the Respondent is
mandatory. The Tribunal tends to agree with the Claimant that, taken on its own, the word
“shall” implies that there is no discretion on the part of the host State confronted with a
request for arbitration. On the other hand, “shall” can also be understood as implying a
future action. In this sense, the use of the word “shall” does not necessarily imply
automaticity in the achievement of the contemplated result.

It comes as no surprise that the Parties have not articulated any clear difference between
“assent” and “consent”. A review of relevant dictionaries does not allow one to identify the
substance of the distinction, if any. Black’s Law Dictionary defines “assent” as
“[algreement, approval, or permission, esp. verbal or nonverbal conduct reasonably
interpreted as willingness”.?"° The definition refers back to consent. “Consent” is defined as
“[algreement, approval or permission as to some act or purpose, esp. given voluntarily by a
competent person; legally effective assent”.2"'

Garner's Dictionary of Legal Usage indicates that the verbs assent, consent, accede,
agree, acquiesce, subscribe share the sense “to express a willingness to go along with

212
213

someone else’s wishes or views”. With regard to assent, the dictionary states that assent
“involves the intellect and applies to propositions or opinions”, whereas consent “involves
feelings or the will and connotes complying with a request”. The dictionary adds, “[o]f
course, one can assent or consent against one’s better judgment’.*"* Merriam-Webster’s
Dictionary of Law defines “assent” as follows: “1. v. to agree to something esp. freely and
with understanding: give one’s assent; 2. n. agreement to a matter under consideration
esp. based on freedom of choice and a reasonable knowledge of the matter”.°"° It defines
“consent” as follows: “1. compliance in or approval of what is done or proposed by another;

2. agreement as to action or opinion”.?"

. These definitions do not allow one to draw a clear distinction between the two terms. Both

“consent” and “assent” are manifestations indicating a willingness to engage in certain
conduct or an agreement with a proposed opinion. It is true that “consent” is a term of
foundational importance in the area of international dispute settlement. In the ICSID
framework, disputing parties are required to “consent in writing” to ICSID arbitration.
Accordingly, one might venture to say that, prima facie at least, assent may not suffice to
create the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal.

In the same vein, the Tribunal tends to agree with the Respondent that the natural
meaning of “shall assent to any request” seems to imply a certain time sequence. Indeed,
this expression lends support to the view that the investor must first file a request and only
thereafter will the host State “assent”.

A closer look to the consequences of the Parties’ theses may be helpful. If one adopts one
or the other of the Claimant’s approach, it is clear that the Respondent's consent existed at
the latest at the time of filing the request for arbitration.

. By contrast, the consequences of Indonesia’s interpretation give rise to a number of

questions. Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT is unequivocal in that Indonesia committed
itself to grant its assent. It indicates that the host State “shall assent to any request”. The
Tribunal understands this formulation as implying that, in one manner or another, a
qualifying investor will have access to ICSID arbitration. However, under Indonesia’s
interpretation, even if this Tribunal were to hold that Indonesia has an obligation to

172.

consent, it could not enforce it as only the inter-State arbitral tribunal could determine
whether Indonesia legitimately withheld its consent.

There are at least three main difficulties with this theory. First, there is no specific link
between the investor-State and the inter-State arbitration clauses, none of which makes a
cross-reference to the other. Second, even if an inter-State arbitral tribunal under Article 8
of the Treaty were to hold that Indonesia breached its obligation under Article 7(1), it is not
clear to what extent Churchill could eventually have recourse to ICSID arbitration. If the
inter-State tribunal considers that Indonesia was bound to give its assent upon the filing of
Churchill's request for arbitration, that tribunal would not be in a position to procure
Indonesia’s missing consent. It could order specific performance. It would be left to
Indonesia to abide by such order with the result that Churchill might remain without
recourse to ICSID arbitration.

Third, it is generally accepted that, in the ICSID framework, consent must exist on the day
when the request for arbitration is filed.*'> Indonesia’s thesis that consent under Article 7(1)
would by definition be provided after the filing of the request is at odds with this
requirement. In sum, Indonesia’s thesis raises difficulties which square badly with the
categorical connotation of “shall assent”.

. To conclude, the interpretation on the basis of the meaning of the words of the treaty is

inconclusive, as two readings of the words “shall assent” are possible. The Tribunal will
now review whether the context lends support to one reading rather than the other.

3.5 The context surrounding the words “shall assent”

Several observations can be made on the context of the words “shall assent”. First, Article
7 only provides for access to ICSID to the exclusion of other fora. Thus, on the
international plane, the only possibility for Churchill to obtain redress is by gaining access
to ICSID arbitration. Although not conclusive, this observation rather lends support to the
investor's argumentation.

the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other
States, § 24 [available at _https://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partB-
section05.htm#02].

52

173. Second, Article 7(1) lacks any indication as to how Indonesia is to give its assent. If one

17:

&

N

assumes Indonesia’s interpretation to be correct, i.e. that Indonesia must give its assent
after the filing of a request, one would expect Article 7 to specify the modalities of such
assent. This observation also seems to favor the Claimant's position.

Third, Article 7(1) mandates the host State to assent to “any request”. Indonesia argues
that it has the discretion, albeit limited, to withhold its consent if the jurisdictional
requirement contained in Article 2(1) is not met. While it will review the merits of
Indonesia's objection based on Article 2(1) in the framework of Indonesia's second
preliminary objection, it must determine now whether Indonesia can legitimately withhold
its consent in light of the alleged link between Article 7(1) and Article 2(1). The plain words
of Article 7(1) state that Indonesia “shall assent” to “any request”. Article 7(1) contains no
link to Article 2(1), nor does Article 2(1) refer to Article 7(1). In these circumstances, the
Tribunal cannot accept that Article 7(1) grants Indonesia discretion to assent or not
depending on the assessment of the requirements set in Article 2(1). While Indonesia’s
objection under Article 2(1) may eventually be well-founded, it is not for Indonesia to make
that determination at the level of its assent under Article 7, but for this Tribunal ruling on its
jurisdiction.

In sum, the context surrounding the words “shall assent”, while not decisive, rather favors
Churchill’s interpretation that it has a right to initiate ICSID arbitration.

3.6 The object and purpose of the BIT

The Claimant argues that Indonesia’s interpretation frustrates the object and purpose of
the Treaty, which, in accordance with the preamble, is to “create favourable conditions for
[...] investments by nationals and companies of one State in the territory of the other
State”.?"°

For its part, Indonesia argues that the mere adherence to a bilateral investment treaty does
not automatically commit the Contracting States to provide optimal and maximum security
to foreign investors.*"” In this regard, Indonesia puts forward that a “State may balance the
policy of encouraging investment by investors of the other State party to the BIT with other
policies or considerations, one of which may be to preserve the ability to avoid ICSID

18

arbitration of disputes relating to investments outside the protection of the BIT in
question”.*"® In any event, Indonesia contends that an interpretation based on the object
and purpose of a treaty cannot go against the plain language of a treaty.?"°

The Tribunal considers that the object and purpose of the treaty is neutral for present
purposes. The preamble of the UK-Indonesia BIT states that the United Kingdom and
Indonesia strive “to create favourable conditions for greater economic co-operation
between them and in particular for investments by nationals and companies of one State in
the territory of the other State”.° The preamble further provides that both States
recognize “that the encouragement and reciprocal protection under international
agreement of such investments will be conducive to the stimulation of individual business
initiative and will increase prosperity in both States”."' In other words, the preamble refers
to both the private interests of the investor as well as the public interests of the State. It is
thus of little assistance in the present context.

At this juncture, the result of the Tribunal’s analysis can be summarized as follows. First,
for the reasons stated above, the ordinary meaning of “shall assent” is unclear. Second,
the context rather supports Churchill's interpretation, without however delivering a fatal
blow to Indonesia’s interpretation. Third, the object and purpose of the BIT is of no avail in
the present dispute.

As a result, the Tribunal cannot but find that the meaning of “shall assent” is unclear or
ambiguous. Consequently, it will now review any relevant supplementary means of
interpretation pursuant to Article 32 VCLT. In doing so, it will conduct a review of cases
and scholarly writings which it had not covered in the first step of the analysis to better
focus on the treaty’s intrinsic elements.

circumstances surrounding the treaty’s conclusion. It does not give an exhaustive list of

admissible materials and the Tribunal thus has latitude to include any element capable of
shedding light on the interpretation of “shall assent”.

Since the Respondent has put most emphasis on doctrinal writings and the Claimant on
case law, the Tribunal will address these materials first. Accordingly, the analysis will focus
on (i) doctrinal writings, (ii) case law, (iii) the treaty practice of Indonesia and the United
Kingdom with third States, and (iv) the preparatory materials regarding the negotiation of
the UK-Indonesia BIT.

3.7.1 Doctrinal writings on “shall assent”

Indonesia filed a number of doctrinal writings”? showing virtual unanimity in support of
Indonesia’s interpretation of the “shall assent” clause.” It stresses that the first author to
comment upon a “shall assent” clause was Aron Broches, the father of the ICSID
Convention. In 1982, he wrote that the “shall assent” clause of the 1968 Netherlands-
Indonesia Economic Cooperation Treaty “would not [...] by itself, enable the investor to
institute proceedings before the Centre” and that “[a] request to that effect would
presumably be rejected by the Secretary-General of the Centre”.’** He also stated that if
the host State refused to give its consent once asked, the home State could resort to
remedies available under the treaty or other rules of international law.”*°

The same opinion was expressed by others,”® including Parra®”’ and Schreuer””® who
also took the view that “shall assent” does not amount to a standing consent and that a
failure of a host State to grant such assent when requested by the qualifying investor can
only be resolved through inter-State arbitration.

For its part, Churchill asserts that none of these authors engages in an in-depth analysis of
“shall assent” clauses, mostly relying on previous publications. According to Churchill,
these authors can all be placed in a single “citation chain” that one can trace back to
Broches citing nothing in support of his opinion. Churchill also notes that the recent
decision in Millicom v. Senegal, to which we will revert, has led certain observers to be less
assertive about the meaning of “shall assent”. For instance, Dolzer and Schreuer, while
sticking to the conventional wisdom, have in fact uncritically taken notice of the Millicom
decision. Commenting on Article 11 of the Netherlands-Indonesia treaty of 1968,
Newcombe and Paradell are of the view that the meaning of “shall assent” is not as clear-
cut as most doctrinal writings make it to be and that “[t]he effect of the article is unclear”.””°
Doctrinal writings may indeed provide guidance on the state of the law (Article 38(1)(d) of
the ICJ Statute) and it is self-evident that an opinion grounded on thorough research and
rigorous reasoning is more likely to influence the interpretative process than one that is
not. Bearing this in mind, it is striking that the doctrinal opinions invoked by Indonesia
essentially rely on previous writings and refer to Broches and Schreuer (who himself cites
Broches) and quote similar provisions in various BITs.

To mention only the most authoritative here, Broches, who appears to have been the first
to address the “shall assent” clause, only seeks support in similar provisions in other Dutch
and English BITs; he does not refer to any documents emanating from the Contracting

States eliciting the intention of the drafters.?°° Schreuer too merely reviews Article 10 of the
1988 Netherlands-Pakistan BIT, refers to similar provisions in other BITs, and cites to
Broches and Dolzer & Stevens.**' Chester Brown and Audley Sheppard*? contrast the
“shall assent” clause of the UK-Indonesia BIT with the 1972 UK Model dispute settlement
clause by referring to the official commentary on the UK Model BIT.**? They do not engage
in a more detailed discussion of the UK-Indonesia BIT and do not refer to materials or
arguments to establish the intent of the Contracting States.

The Tribunal tends to agree with the Claimant’s argument about the “citation chain” and
cannot but conclude that the doctrinal writings are inconclusive.

3.7.2 The Millicom decision

Indonesia has not referred to any cases corroborating its interpretation, while Churchill
heavily relied on Millicom, which held that a similar provision in the Netherlands-Senegal
BIT contained the host State’s standing offer to engage in ICSID arbitration.?**

In Millicom, the tribunal was confronted with the interpretation of Article 10 of the
Netherlands-Senegal BIT, which in its official version reads as follows:

“La Partie Contractante sur le territoire de laquelle un ressortissant de
Pautre Partie Contractante effectue ou envisage d’effectuer un
investissement, devra consentir a toute demande de la part de ce
ressortissant en vue de soumettre, pour arbitrage ou conciliation, tout
différend pouvant surgir au sujet de cet investissement au Centre
institué en vertu de la Convention de Washington du 18 mars 1965
pour le réglement des différends relatifs aux investissements entre
Etats et ressortissants d’autres Etats” (emphasis added).

With regard to the Netherlands BITs, and in addition to the 1968 Netherlands-Indonesia BIT,
Broches refers to the 1971 Netherlands-Morocco BIT, the 1971 Netherlands-Ivory Coast BIT, the
1972 Netherlands-Singapore BIT, the 1974 Netherlands-Korea BIT, and the 1976 Netherlands-
Egypt BIT. With regard to the United Kingdom BITs, Broches refers to the 1976 UK-Indonesia BIT
and the 1980 UK-Philippines BIT. Finally, Broches mentions the 1977 Japan-Egypt BIT. See
Aron Broches, ‘Bilateral Investment Protection Treaties and Arbitration of Investment Disputes’, in:

Arbitration (Kluwer Law, 1982), p. 66 (Exh. RLA-036).

In the English translation used by the tribunal, Article 10 is worded as follows:

“The Contracting Party in the territory of which a national of the other
Contracting Party makes or intends to make an investment shall
assent to any request on the part of such national to submit, for
arbitration or conciliation, any dispute that may arise in connection
with that investment, to the centre established by the Washington
Convention of 18 March 1965 on the settlement of investment
disputes between States and nationals of other States” (emphasis
added).

In the Tribunal’s view, the correct English translation of the French authentic text “devra
consentir” would be “shall consent” rather than “shall assent”. In spite of this difference, the
reasoning of the Millicom tribunal is interesting. While it accepts that the wording is “not
unequivocal”, the Tribunal focuses on its mandatory nature (“devra” and not “pourra”) and
considers that “in spite of the wording of the rule, Senegal’s ratification of the Accord

entails consent to the ICSID arbitration system”.”* It

“does not see why it would be
necessary [...], to adopt a two-step procedure pursuant to which, before submitting a
request, the party intending to act would have to request authorization from the Contracting

State which it would have no right to refuse, unless otherwise specifically stated”.?%

. The Millicom tribunal then confirms its understanding by reference to the origin®’ and the

“spirit” of the rule. Under this latter heading, it notes that “the purpose of a treaty such as
that in question is indeed to guarantee efficient and full protection. This purpose is made
clear, in particular, by Articles 3 and 4 of the Accord, whose objective is ‘sécurité intégrale
(‘full security”) (Article 4, paragraph 1). Such objective, however, cannot be truly attained

unless investors, the primary beneficiaries of the protection, dispose of legal means
enabling them to obtain compliance therewith”.

While this Tribunal is certainly prepared to pay due regard to earlier decisions, it does not
believe that Millicom is of much assistance here. Indeed, it does not reveal how it followed
the process of interpretation outlined in the Vienna Convention.

[...], but there is no reason why the establishment by the new rule of its mandatory nature could not

3.7.3 Treaties with third States

Treaties on the same subject matter concluded respectively by the United Kingdom and
Indonesia with third States can legitimately be considered as part of the supplementary
means of interpretation. For instance, in Oil Platforms, the ICJ had recourse to treaties
concluded by one disputing party with third States dealing with the same subject-matter.**°
This approach also found resonance in investment treaty arbitration, for example in
AAPL?** or in Plama.?*'

Prior to the hearing, the Parties had filed a selection of BITs of either the United Kingdom
or Indonesia and third parties. To gain a complete view of potential treaty patterns for its
decision, the Tribunal drew up a tentative table containing the dispute settlement clauses
entered into by the United Kingdom and Indonesia with third parties. It circulated that table
for the Parties’ comments in two rounds of post-hearing submissions.

On this basis, the Tribunal will now pursue its interpretation of the words “shall assent” in
Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT. In doing so, it does not mean to make any finding on
the existence of consent to arbitration in the third party treaties. It limits itself to a prima
facie analysis of such treaties and expresses an opinion on the UK-Indonesia BIT only.

According to publicly available information, the United Kingdom signed 102 BITs, of which
94 have entered into force. Broadly speaking, one discerns four categories:

e Inthe first category, 53 BITs give the investor access to ICSID arbitration. Out of
these, 49 BITs give only access to ICSID,* while three others provide that, if

one of the States is not a member of the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Additional
Facility mechanism or UNCITRAL arbitration is available.“* The last BIT provides
that, unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, ICSID is the default
procedure.?**

The vast majority of these 53 BITs follows the first UK model clause of 1972,
whereby each Contracting State “hereby consents” to submit any dispute to
ICSID.“° The others use similar wording. In the UK-Mexico BIT, each
Contracting State gives its “unconditional consent” to ICSID arbitration. In the
UK-Romania BIT, the investor “shall be entitled to submit” the dispute to ICSID.
In the UK-Chile BIT, the investor “may submit” the dispute to ICSID. In the UK-
Costa Rica BIT, the Contracting States also consented to ICSID arbitration
(“consciente en someter’). In the UK-Venezuela BIT, the investor “may choose to
refer” the dispute to ICSID, if available. In the UK-India BIT, any dispute “may be
referred” to ICSID, if available.

e The second category includes 46 BITs that provide for UNCITRAL arbitration as
the default procedure. Most of these BITs follow the second UK model clause,
whereby the disputing parties “may agree” to submit their dispute to ICSID.™°
However, in the absence of an agreement, the investor has the right to initiate
UNCITRAL proceedings.**” Others allow an investor to choose several arbitral

consent for UNCITRAL only.2°

e The third category is composed of the UK-Indonesia BIT and the UK-Philippines
BIT. Both BITs indicate that the host State “shall assent” to ICSID arbitration.

e The fourth category comprises only the 1978 UK-Thailand BIT, which contains no
investor-State dispute settlement provision.

199. The foregoing description shows that the United Kingdom seems to follow a consistent

20

S

policy of securing access to international arbitration for their investors. In 99 cases out of
102 the relevant dispute settlement clauses enshrine an expression of consent.

As regards the United Kingdom’s treaty practice at the time of the conclusion of the UK-
Indonesia BIT in 1976, the description above shows that the first optional model clause
containing the “hereby consents” language is replicated in several BITs concluded during
the 1970s, while the second optional model clause is employed for the first time in 1982.

. From the information on record, the United Kingdom signed its first BIT, the UK-Egypt BIT,

on 24 February 1975, followed on 22 July 1975 by the signature of the UK-Singapore BIT,
and on 4 March 1976 with the signature of the UK-Korea BIT. All these BITs employ the
unequivocal “hereby consents” language. These three BITs precede the signature of the
UK-Indonesia BIT, which took place on 27 April 1976. Finally, the United Kingdom signed a
BIT with Thailand in 1978 with no dispute settlement provision for investor-State
arbitration; and on 10 October 1979 the United Kingdom signed a BIT with Jordan again
employing the “hereby consents” language.

202. Turning now to the analysis of Indonesia’s treaty practice, the information on record shows

that Indonesia signed 64 BITs,”*' 49 of which are in force. In addition, Indonesia concluded
an economic cooperation agreement with the Netherlands in 1968, which is the only other
agreement entered into by Indonesia containing the “shall assent” language. Indonesia
also concluded a BIT with Australia which contains the wording “shall consent in writing
[...] within 45 days”, a provision directly relevant to ICSID arbitration ARB/12/40.

203. The tables provided by the Parties in response to the Tribunal’s listings show 25 different

formulations indicating Indonesia’s advance consent to international arbitration:

a. “hereby consents to submit”;?°?

b. “hereby consents to the submission”;”°*

c. “hereby gives its unconditional consent”;?*

In its first post-hearing submission, Churchill provided the Tribunal with a list of 58 BITs concluded
by Indonesia, out of which 50 are publicly available. In addition, Churchill referred to the Agreement
Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area. Cf. C-PHB1, Annex 1. Indonesia

does not include the Indonesia-France BIT either as it mandates the inclusion of consent in
the investment approval documentation.’ Finally, the only BIT entered into by Indonesia
and still in force, which unequivocally lacks a standing offer to arbitrate, is the Indonesia-
Switzerland BIT containing no investor-State dispute settlement provision at all.

More specifically in relation to BITs concluded in or around the 1970s, i.e. the decade of
the BIT under review, the first investor-State dispute settlement clause entered into by
Indonesia is contained in the 1968 economic cooperation agreement with the Netherlands.
It employs the “shall assent” language and refers to ICSID arbitration. In the same year,
Indonesia concluded BITs with Germany and Denmark, none of which provided for
investor-State arbitration.2”°

During the 1970s, Indonesia concluded only four BITs. The first one, the Indonesia-
Belgium BIT, provides that each Contracting State “hereby irrevocably and anticipatory

thus implying that the BIT itself does not encompass advance consent.*' The third BIT,
with Switzerland contains no dispute settlement provision at all; and the fourth BIT was the
Uk-Indonesia BIT.

To sum up, the United Kingdom’s practice is to secure advance consent to international
arbitration, including during the 1970s. Indonesia follows a similar practice but clauses
adopted in the 1970s show considerable variations. As a result, third party treaty practice
does not allow one to reach a conclusion on the meaning of “shall assent” thus leading the
Tribunal to review the preparatory materials that are on the record.

3.7.4 Preparatory materials

. Neither Party has put any travaux préparatoires into evidence prior to the hearing.

Churchill mostly relied on explanatory notes eliciting the Dutch government's
understanding of “shall assent” clauses which that government concluded with third
parties.®* Upon a question from the Tribunal the Parties indicated that they had tried to
locate travaux of the UK-Indonesia BIT, but had been unsuccessful.”*

In the course of the deliberation, the Tribunal became aware through a press article of the
award on jurisdiction rendered in Rizvi, the first case directly dealing with the UK-Indonesia
BIT.” Since the award had not been published, the Tribunal invited Indonesia to circulate
that decision with the understanding that the content would be kept confidential. It
appeared that in Rizvi Indonesia filed the travaux préparatoires of the British Government.

The Tribunal therefore informed the Parties that it envisaged to requesting preparatory
materials from the United Kingdom pursuant to Rule 34 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.
While Indonesia objected to this course of action, Churchill advised the Tribunal that it had

engaged in new research and located the relevant materials. It filed these materials with its
first post-hearing submission, and both Parties then commented on them.

. According to the Claimant, the preparatory materials reveal that “neither the British nor the

Indonesian side intended for the term ‘shall assent’ to have any effect different from that of
the United Kingdom Model BIT of that time”, and that the travaux “confirm that the treaty
negotiators intended and believed the ‘shall assent’ language to comprise a binding and
effective offer to arbitrate disputes before ICSID”.°° For its part, Indonesia avers that
Churchill is unable to point to a single document proving that the phrase “shall assent”
reflects a standing consent to ICSID arbitration,”°° and that Churchill's reading of the
materials is “deeply flawed because it imputes to the negotiators a state of mind based
upon the benefit of hindsight”.”°”

The British materials contain four folders from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
archives.” They are mainly composed of internal notes and drafts of British officials and
counter-drafts submitted by Indonesia. With respect to Article 7 of the BIT, the materials
contain no exchanges of notes or similar documents clearly depicting a common
understanding. The Tribunal nevertheless believes that it may draw some useful
indications from these materials, both of the intentions of the British negotiators and of
Indonesia. With these considerations in mind, the Tribunal now embarks upon a closer
analysis of these travaux.

Negotiations between the United Kingdom and Indonesia took place in 1974 and 1975.
The principal negotiators on the British side were Messrs. Desmond Kerr of the Financial
Relations Department and Anthony Aust from the Office of Legal Adviser of the British
Foreign and Commonwealth Office; and on the Indonesian side Messrs. Ferdy Salim,
Director for International Trade Relations, and Sanadji, Head of Administration Division,
Directorate of Investment and Finance.

It appears that the British Government initiated contacts with Indonesia and proposed a
draft agreement. In that proposal, the investor-State dispute settlement provision replicated

the optional model clause of the 1972 UK Model BIT, that is the standard “hereby
consents” language.”

215. On 11 March 1974, Indonesia provided a counter-draft to Article 7, which read as follows:

“The Contracting Party in the territory of which a national of the other
Contracting Party makes or intends to make an investment, shall
assent to any demand on the part of such national and any such
national shall comply with any request of the former Contracting
Party, to submit, for conciliation or arbitration, to the Centre
established by the Convention of Washington of March 18, 1965, any
dispute that may arise in connection with the investment”.*°°

216. In June 1974, the two main British negotiators, Messrs. Kerr and Aust, exchanged

comments on the Indonesian counter-draft. Their observations essentially focus on
Indonesia's attempt to introduce some sort of reciprocity in the disputing parties’ possibility
to initiate ICSID arbitration. Mr. Kerr thus wrote:

“The Indonesians have redrafted the Article. Their text is shorter but
more importantly it now contains a new provision; i.e. an investor
must assent to a demand by the host Government to submit a dispute
to ICSID. The new provision is unacceptable because HMG cannot
force a UK investor to accept arbitration or conciliation by ICSID.
Additionally we should point out to the Indonesians that the text of the
UK Article 7 has been approved by the Centre and indeed is based
on ICSID’s own model arbitration clauses”.*'

217. A few months later, in November 1974, Indonesia submitted a second counter-proposal, in

which Article 7 read as follows:

“Each Contracting Party hereby irrevocably and anticipatory [sic]
gives its consent to submit to conciliation and arbitration any dispute
relating to a measure contrary to this Agreement, pursuant to the
Convention of Washington of 18 March 1965, to the International
Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes at the initiative of a
national or legal person of the other Contracting Party, who considers
himself to have been affected by such a measure.

This consent implies renunciation of the requirement that the internal
administrative or judicial resorts should be exhausted”.®

218. This second counter proposal was accompanied by (i) a copy of the UK Model BIT dispute
settlement clause with the “hereby consents” language,””° and (ii) a copy of the Indonesia-
Belgium BIT containing a nearly identical dispute settlement provision to the one submitted
by Indonesia in its second proposal.”**

219. Mr. Kerr, who had “a strong preference for our longer draft which has been cleared with
ICSID”,”*° reiterated the British Government's preference for the draft based on the UK
Model BIT in a communication to the British Embassy in Jakarta:

“The FCO prefer the longer version of this Article which was proposed
in their original draft. They would be prepared to amend that Article to
provide for references of disputes to ICSID for settlement by
conciliation and by arbitration, but they would be reluctant to
relinquish their original wording which was agreed by ICSID (and
recently accepted by the Singapore Government). They would
appreciate an explanation of the intention behind the Indonesian
proposal and its reconsideration in the light of these comments”.?°

220. Still negotiating on the basis of Indonesia’s second proposal, in February 1975, Mr. Kerr
sought the advice of the Office’s Legal Adviser, Ms. Densa:

tal

2. As regards Article 8 of the revised model Agreement, the position
is that we have agreed to provide for conciliation by ICSID when the
other Government with which we are negotiating wants this. But we
have not so far done the necessary drafting and | should be grateful
for your advice on how we should tackle this.

3. | have made some draft manuscript amendments to the existing
version of Article 8 to provide for conciliation as well as arbitration. |
should be grateful for your comments on these suggested
amendments. | would also value your views whether it would not both
be better and simpler to totally change this Article and replace it by a
much shorter Article on the lines of that which appears in the 1968
Netherlands Agreement with Indonesia. This reads:

“The Contracting Party in the territory of which a national or the
other Contracting Party makes or intends to make an
investment, shall assent to any demand on the part of such

national and any such national shall comply with any request of
the former Contracting Party, to submit, for conciliation or
arbitration, to the Centre established by the Convention of
Washington of March 18, 1965, any dispute that may arise in
connection with the investment”.

4. | incline myself to prefer this shorter version. Certainly the
Indonesians are mystified by our present version which seems to
them to suffer from reproducing too much of the content of the
Washington Convention. We are at the moment arguing for the
retention of our present version, but | am not at all sure that we are
wise to do so. Would we lose anything were we to substitute the
precise language of the Netherlands Agreement with Indonesia?”**”

Several other internal notes discuss various points of contention raised by Indonesia with
respect to the draft dispute settlement provision. For instance, Mr. Kerr wrote to
Mr. Crowson in Jakarta on 13 June 1975 that the British Government was actively
considering agreeing to Indonesia’s request to include a reference to conciliation:

“This revision makes provision for conciliation as well as arbitration,
which is something on which the Indonesians were keen. If you were
to pass this on it might serve the purpose of showing the Indonesians
that we are doing our best to meet their points. The revised Article
has been agreed with ICSID”.*°

On the eve of the in-person negotiations on 29 September 1975, Indonesia, through

Mr. Salim, submitted a third counter proposal, mirroring its first one, which in pertinent part
read as follows:

“The Department would like to propose a version which it has with
other countries such as the Netherlands instead of using the longer
version of the UK’s draft. It reads as follows:

“The Contracting Party in the territory of which a national of the
other Contracting Party makes or intends to make an
investment, shall assent to any demand on the part of such

second draft proposal to Ms. Densa, commenting that “[t]he English is a little odd but the sense is
clear” and adding that “there might be some advantage in attempting to add to it the second and last
sentences of our wording of Article 8(1)” dealing with standing of locally incorporated but foreign-
controlled companies. See Telegram from Mr. Kerr to Ms. Densa (Legal Advisers Office),

national and any such national shall comply with any request of
the former Contracting Party, to submit, for conciliation or
arbitration, to the Centre established by the Convention of
Washington of March 18, 1965 any dispute that may arise in

connection with the investment”.

223. Mr. Kerr's response to Mr. Salim regarding the latest proposal reads as follows:

“This Article should deal both with the cases of nationals and
companies. We would insert the words ‘or company’ after ‘national’ in
the first two cases where the word occurs. We are, however, doubtful
whether we can agree that nationals or companies should be obliged
to refer disputes to ICSID upon the volition of the Contracting Parties.
We wish to discuss this point. We do not think this requirement
appears in other Agreements, nor, as far as we are aware, do we
have authority to commit British nationals or companies in this sense.

We also propose the reinstatement of the second sentence of the
United Kingdom draft which would cover the cases of locally-
incorporated companies in Indonesia or the United Kingdom where
the majority of the shares were owned by the nationals of the other
State, as envisaged in the ICSID Convention. Without this provision,
in view of the requirements of the Foreign Capital Investment Law No.
1 of 1967, the Article could not be invoked in respect of an approved
investment in Indonesia”.*°°

224. Negotiations then took place in Jakarta between 29 September and 3 October 1975.°"'
Following the initialing of the authentic text, an internal British note reported that on
balance the result of the negotiations was satisfactory.°°* More specifically, it stated:

“2. The Agreement with Indonesia differs a little in its Articles 2, 4, 7
and 8 from the Agreements with Singapore and Egypt. [...]

21. The Indonesians insisted on the short version of this Article which
appears in the first paragraph. This is similar to that adopted in their
Agreements with other Western European countries. We argued the
toss on this for a little time but spent most effort on securing the
second paragraph of the Article which will enable British majority
shareholders in locally-incorporated companies in Indonesia (almost
all our investment being in this category) to refer disputes with
Indonesia to ICSID. Because companies are defined in Article 1 in
terms of their place of incorporation, it was essential to obtain this if

the Article were to be capable of application. A very long time was
spent on this point and we were obliged at one stage, when the
Indonesians objected that none of our European colleagues had
either requested or obtained such a provision, to describe the ICSID
Articles in their Agreements as meaningless since they did not give
ICSID jurisdiction in the case of foreign-controlled locally-incorporated
companies. The point went home, and this was the final major matter
to be covered in the negotiation”.

“The balance of the Agreement as a whole is satisfactory to us. It

gives our investors assurance of the future admission of their

investment to Indonesia, its equitable treatment there and fair

compensation in the event of expropriation. It provides a sound

framework within which further investment can take place and affords

adequate protection for approved existing and future investment”.°°°
This review shows several crucial elements at odds with Indonesia’s argument. First,
Indonesia submitted three drafts of the investor-State dispute settlement provision. The
first and third replicated the dispute settlement provision which Indonesia had concluded
with the Netherlands in 1968, while the second reproduced the clause agreed with Belgium
in 1970. Interestingly, Indonesia's second draft contained a proposal of unconditional
advance consent to ICSID arbitration, i.e. “hereby irrevocably and anticipatory [sic] gives
its consent”. While it is true that the final text does not contain the unequivocal formula of
the second draft, the fact that Indonesia made a proposal of such content demonstrates
that it had no difficulty giving English investors unconditional access to ICSID arbitration.

Second, Indonesia’s first and third drafts contain an element of reciprocity which was
contentious. The draft provides that each Contracting State “shall assent” to any request
coming from the foreign investor and that the latter “shall comply” with any request coming
from the host State to submit to ICSID arbitration. The British negotiators could not accept
that formulation because they felt that the State cannot force its citizens to accept
arbitration. That divergence hinged on the investor's not the State’s consent.

Third, Indonesia objected to the 1972 UK model clause because it did not provide for
conciliation. It insisted on the inclusion of conciliation in the dispute settlement clause. The
United Kingdom apparently modified its model clause in 1975 and added conciliation. Here
again, the divergence had nothing to do with the host State’s consent.

229.

Fourth, the real stumbling block in the negotiations did not turn on standing consent, but on
the right for locally incorporated investment vehicles under foreign control to initiate ICSID
arbitration in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. It is difficult to
envisage that the negotiators would have fought for and against this right had they thought
that its very existence was conditional on the will of the respondent State.

As the Claimant puts it “[i]f Article 7 in the First Counter-Draft had required an additional
act of consent, the British negotiators should have considered the proposed Article 7 in the
Second Counter-Draft as a positive step towards the binding consent established under
the United Kingdom Model BIT, and one would have expected a favourable or
congratulatory remark of the negotiators”.°™ Yet, the British negotiators do not appear to
have considered the “shall assent” in the first counter-draft to be a step backwards
compared to the British model clause. Nor did they regard the “hereby irrevocably and
anticipatory [sic] gives its consent” language of the second counter-draft as a step forward
or the return to “shall assent” in the third counter-proposals as a new step back. The
materials show that these changes were regarded as indifferent. While the preparatory
materials on record may not be complete, the same indifference appears to have existed
among Indonesia's negotiators. They were mainly concerned because (i) the British
proposal was too long and reproduced too many elements mentioned in Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention, and (ii) no conciliation was provided. There is no trace of an intent to
grant consent on a case-by-case basis, let alone to institute a so-called two-step procedure
as presently alleged by the Respondent. They apparently had no difficulty proposing
wording expressly providing unconditional consent. Nor did they seem to oppose shifting
back and forth from explicitly unconditional language to the “shall assent” clause. In the
exchange with Mr. Kerr on the eve of the meeting in Jakarta, Mr. Salim says nothing about
“shall assent” being different from Indonesia's second counter-draft or from the British
draft.

. For all these reasons, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the treaty drafters

considered the “shall assent” language as functionally equivalent to “hereby consents” or
similar wording. Accordingly, the Tribunal holds that Indonesia has given its advance
consent to arbitrate the dispute presently before it.

C-PHB1, 4 98.

72

4. Conclusion

23

. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that Article 7(1) contains a standing offer to
arbitrate any dispute that may arise in connection with an investment before ICSID.
Churchill was therefore entitled to submit its Request for Arbitration directly to the Centre
and no further act was required from Indonesia for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction.

232. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal mentions that it would also have found consent
to ICSID arbitration in the BKPM Approvals, had it held, quod non, that an additional
expression of consent was required under the BIT.

233. Section IX(4) the 2005 BKPM approval, as translated by the Claimant, reads as follows:

“In the event of a dispute between the company and the Government
of the Republic of Indonesia that cannot be resolved by consensus,
the Government of Indonesia [is] willing to follow the settlement
according to the provisions of the Convention on the settlement of
disputes between States and Foreign Citizen sfegarding investments
in accordance with Law Number 5 Year 1968”.%°

234. Indonesia's version reads:

“In the event of dispute between the company and the Government of
the Republic of Indonesia which cannot be settled by
consultation/deliberation, the Government of Indonesia is
prepared/ready to follow settlement according to the provisions of the
convention on the settlement of disputes between States and Foreign
Citizen regarding investments in accordance with Law Number 5 Year
1968”.

235. In its original wording, Section IX(4) reads as follows:

“Dalam hal terjadi perselisihan antara perusahaan dengan
Pemerintah Republik Indonesia yang tidak dapat diselesaikan secara
musyawarah, Pemerintah Indonesia bersedia mengikuti penyelesaian
menurut ketentuan konvensi tentang penyelesaian perselisihan
antara Negara dan Warga Negara Asing mengenai penanaman
modal sesuai dengan Undang-undang Nomor 5 Tahun 1968”.

The 2006 BKPM Approval, sanctioning the acquisition of PT ICD by Churchill and Planet
incorporates by reference the content of the 2005 Approval.°°”

Indonesia has essentially objected that (i) the BIT only contemplates the possibility to grant
consent after the filing of a request of arbitration, (ii) that the BKPM lacks authority to grant
consent to ICSID arbitration, (iii) that the word bersedia in Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM
approval merely denotes a willingness to consider ICSID procedures, not consent, and (iv)
that Section IX(4) only extends to PT ICD and not its shareholders.

The Tribunal finds these objections ill-founded. First, as regards the timing of consent,
Article 7(1) of the BIT contains no language precluding a host State from granting its
consent to ICSID arbitration prior to the filing of a dispute by an investor. Second, the
Tribunal finds that the words bersedia mengikuti, correctly translated as
“readiness/preparedness/willingness to follow’ the settlement provisions of the ICSID
Convention are an expression of consent satisfying the ICSID requirement of consent in
writing. Third, the Tribunal holds that Section IX(4) extends to PT ICD’s shareholders
because (i) PT ICD is a mere instrumentality of the Claimant, who had no choice but to

structure its investment through a local vehicle,*°°

(ii) the dictionary on record does not
translate the word perusahaan as company or corporation, but gives it the broader

meaning of business or enterprise,

BKPM Approval when specifically targeting PT ICD as a corporation,“"" while the word

perusahaan is used in various contexts suggesting that it has a broader meaning, in
particular in the 2006 BKPM Approval in the context of the obligation to sell shares of PT
ICD to Indonesian nationals.*"' Finally, the Tribunal is of the view that the BKPM has the
power to grant consent to ICSID arbitration, since it is a government body reporting directly
to the President and vested with authority to handle foreign investments.*"* Had the

President, who was copied on the 2005 BKPM Approval, deemed that the BKPM had
overstepped its authority, then he would or should have intervened to rectify such mistake.
Having failed to do so, Indonesia cannot now argue that the BKPM lacked authority to give
consent to ICSID proceedings.

Having held that Article 7(1) contains Indonesia’s consent to arbitration, the Tribunal will
now assess whether that consent extends to Churchill’s investment in light of Indonesia's
second preliminary objection relating to Article 2(1) of the BIT.

SECOND OBJECTION: THE CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENTS ARE NOT PROTECTED UNDER THE BIT

1. The Respondent's position

Indonesia submits two related arguments with regard to the admission requirement. First,
Indonesia contends that it legitimately withheld its consent because the BIT expressly
limits its scope to investments having been granted admission in accordance with the 1967
Foreign Capital Investment Law. Second, Indonesia submits that, even if arguendo the
Tribunal were to find that Indonesia consented to ICSID arbitration as a general matter, the
Tribunal would still lack jurisdiction because the Claimant’s investments fall outside the
scope of protected investments under the BIT.

1.1. The investments fall outside the scope of Article 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT

. Article 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT provides that the treaty shall only apply to those

investments that have been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign
Capital Investment Law.*"* According to Indonesia, this “admitted investments” clause
limits the scope of protected investments under the BIT, even if the Tribunal were to find
that Indonesia gave its consent to ICSID arbitration.°"* In this case, Indonesia contends
that Churchill must be denied protection because it has not been granted admission
pursuant to the 1967 law or any law amending or replacing it.

1.2 The stringent threshold requirement of the “admitted investments” clause

For the Respondent, the admission clause is very important for developing countries such
as Indonesia, as it allows them to screen foreign investments and thereby safeguard their
strategic natural resources.*"® Its primary effect is to condition “the extension of treaty
protections on prior approval of specified investments”.*"°

Relying on Mytilineos v. Serbia and Montenegro, Indonesia argues that Article 2(1) sets a
higher standard than more conventional legality clauses.°"” Indonesia therefore invites the
Tribunal to follow other arbitral tribunals and to dismiss Churchill's case ab initio.°"*

1.3 The investments have not been granted admission in accordance with the 1967
Foreign Capital Investment Law

At the hearing, the Respondent highlighted the fact that the BKPM did not have the
opportunity to review PT ICD’s articles of association before granting its approval on
23 November 2005, although the Respondent acknowledged that PT ICD was granted
admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Investment Law and that the BKPM
approved the Churchill’s and Planet’s acquisition of PT ICD in 2006."

Indonesia interprets the admission requirement not as a threshold whereby once
admission has been granted the requirement is fulfilled, but as a continuous process
whereby a foreign investor violates the admission requirement when engaging in activities

that are not covered by the terms of the BKPM approval.*”° In particular, the Respondent

Investment Law; and (ii) by engaging in mining activities and not confining itself to
providing mining services, the Claimant violated the terms of its admission.°*

In connection with the first argument, the Respondent seeks to rebut the Claimant's
submission that the Bupati of East Kutai authorized it to enter into legal relationships with
the Ridlatama companies.** According to the Respondent, the Bupati’s authorization was
given on condition of abiding with prevailing laws, which the Claimant did not do because it
engaged in mining activities.

Furthermore, the Respondent expanded during the hearing on what it called “indications of
forgery” in its previous submissions.** It argued that there were many irregularities in
certain important documents submitted by the Claimant, including the KP Exploration
Licenses and the maps annexed thereto.*“° Asked to elucidate the link between the forgery
accusations and its jurisdictional objection, the Respondent answered as follows:

“[Tribunal:] Before that, what is the link between this issue and your
jurisdictional objection?

[Respondent:] This is basically to show that there is no interest
whatsoever that the claimant has with respect to the substance
matter, that is, the revocations of KP”.

With respect to the Respondent's second argument related to mining activities, the
Respondent states that Churchill announced on 5 April 2007 and 23 May 2007 that they
made a promising coal discovery, 95% of which being situated in the PT RTM block.**
Stressing that PT RTM allegedly received a mining undertaking license for general survey
on 24 May 2007 only, that is after the announcements, the Respondent contends that

“Churchill and/or PT RTM and/or PT RTP illegally undertook such mining survey activities

1.4 PT ICD’s business field only covers mining support services

Indonesia acknowledges that the Claimant’s investments took the form of ownership of
PT ICD, a local subsidiary, which received approval to operate as a foreign direct
investment company under Indonesian law.°%° However, PT ICD’s business field was
described in the 2005 BKPM Approval as “General Mining Support Services”.**' Similarly,
PT ICD’s Articles of Association define the company’s “objective and purpose” as

“business of geological and mining services”.°*

. In support of this argument, the Respondent confronted Dr. Makarim in cross-examination

with one of his articles published in the Jakarta Post.** In this article, referring to PMA
companies in general and not to PT ICD in particular, Dr. Makarim had expressed the
following opinion:

“Also, the company’s articles of association must have contained
Objectives and Purposes clauses which would most likely limit its
activities to mining services, not mining activities. Conducting
activities that may be constructed as mining would be beyond its
corporate authorization and therefore susceptible to nullification
actions”.°%*

. On that basis, the Respondent argues that “in order to achieve that purpose and objective,

and of course if the activity [...] is interpreted that it is a mining activities [sic], it will be

illogical that you can do mining activities to achieve the purpose and objective of

undertaking mining supporting services”.*>

1.5 The Claimant could only engage in mining activities by concluding a contract of
work or a coal cooperation agreement (PKP2B) with the Indonesian

Government

Under the 1967 Mining Law and the 1980 Regulation No. 27 on Categorization of
Extractive Materials, coal is classified as a strategic natural resource regulated through a
multi-step application process for obtaining mining authorizations.

. According to the Respondent, the Claimant could only engage in mining activities such as

exploitation of a mining site by obtaining a PKP2B — a so-called coal cooperation
agreement — which the Claimant should have concluded with the Government.**° However,
neither PT ICD, nor the Claimant, nor PT TCUP in which the Claimant acquired a majority
in 2010, ever applied for a PKP2B.°°”

Specifically, under the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, foreign investors can only engage in
the field of mining on the basis of direct cooperation with the Government. Article 8(1) of
this act provides that “[floreign capital investment in the field of mining shall be based on a
cooperation with the Government on the basis of a contract of work (‘kontrak karya’) or

other form in accordance with applicable laws and regulations”.°*

. Under Article 1(1) of the 2004 Decree of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources

No. 1614,°%° the contract of work just referred to is defined as “an agreement between the
Government of the Republic of Indonesia with Indonesian legal entity company in the
framework of Foreign Investment to conduct extractive materials mining undertaking,
excluding petroleum, natural gas, geothermal, radio active and coal”.

. According to Article 1(2) of Decree No. 1614, a coal cooperation agreement is an

“agreement between the Indonesian Government with Indonesian legal entity company in

the framework of Foreign Investment to conduct extractive material coal mining

undertaking”.*“°

mining activities (as opposed to mining services) by entering into a PKP2B with the central
Government. Under Decree No. 1614 just referred to, the role of the BKPM is merely to
forward the foreigner’s investment application to the relevant ministries and the President,
who must approve the coal cooperation agreement. Article 24 of such decree states that a
draft PKP2B “that has obtained recommendation from BKPM and has been consulted with
the House of People’s Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia is therefore submitted
by the Minister for approval to the President”.°“' Once approval has been obtained from
the President, Article 25 of Decree No. 1614 directs that the PKP2B must be signed by the
Minister “on behalf of the Government”.

In sum, the BKPM Approvals did not allow PT ICD or Churchill to engage in mining
activities per se. By doing so Churchill failed to observe the limits set forth in the BKPM

Approvals.°“

1.6 The Claimant circumvented the law by securing beneficial ownership in the
Ridlatama licenses

. Indonesia advances that only Indonesian nationals or companies can obtain KP licenses to

engage in mining activities. PMAs such as PT ICD and foreign investors cannot obtain KP
licenses.°*

Indonesia further submits that Article 33 of the 2007 Investment Law, promulgated on
26 April 2007%° and replacing the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law*® prohibits
beneficial ownership by declaring that ownership and benefits associated with it are
indivisible.” Article 33(1) stipulates that “domestic investor and foreign investor which
undertake capital investment in the form of a limited liability company are prohibited from
making any agreement and/or statement which confirms that ownership of share(s) in a
limited liability company is for and on behalf of other party”. Article 33(2) then declares any

such agreement null and void by operation of law.*“® For the Respondent, various
arrangements entered into by PT ICD on behalf of the Claimant violate Article 33 and are
therefore null and void. Therefore, the Claimant should be denied protection under the
BITs.

. In this context, Indonesia emphasizes that Dr. Makarim fails to address Article 33 of the

2007 Investment Law in his first expert report, but has acknowledged in a recent press
article that Indonesian law prohibits arrangements of beneficial ownership.*“°

Indonesia claims that Churchill, through PT ICD, has entered into a series of arrangements
with the Ridlatama companies and their owners which breach the 2007 Investment law by
providing beneficial ownership to PT ICD, and thus ultimately to Churchill itself.
Specifically, it makes the following assertions:°°

- The 22 May 2007 Deed of Beneficial Control and Ownership between PT ICD and
PT RS, PT RP, PT RTM, PT RTP and PT TCUP violates Article 33 as it provides for
PT ICD’s 75% beneficial ownership and control of these companies. **

- The 25 May 2007 agreements (the cooperation agreement, the investors
agreement, the pledge of shares agreements, and the powers of attorney) were
concluded to allow the Claimant to engage in mining activities going beyond mere
mining services and to obtain 75% of the mining revenue. Therefore they violated
the 2007 Investment Law.°*

secure PT ICD’s benefits accruing from the KP licenses, thus violating the 2007
Investment Law.*®*

- The 31 March 2008 agreements between PT ICD and PT IR and PT INP as well as
with Mmes. Florita and Setiawan also breached the 2007 Investment Law.**

Indonesia believes that Churchill knew that it was prohibited to own shares in Indonesian
companies holding KP licenses, as Article 5.7 of the 25 May 2007 Cooperation Agreement
states that “if there is any change in the law of the Republic of Indonesia which allows ICD
to hold TCUP’s shares in each of the KP Holders, TCUP and the KP Holders shall provide
all necessary assistance ... to ensure that such shares are transferred to ICD”.*°

Finally, Indonesia explains that it was not aware of these agreements because the
Claimant operated under confidentiality agreements. However, when the Regent of East
Kutai became aware in 2009 of the beneficial control exerted by the Claimant, most
notably through Churchill's press releases in which it claimed to have become the owner of
the EKCP coal reserves, he immediately requested clarification from Churchill and the
London Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”).°° The Regent also informed the Claimant
that it could not own any interests in Indonesian companies holding KP licenses, and that
he had never issued a PKP2B or a KP license to them or to PT ICD or PT TCUP.°*”

In any event, the Claimant's interest in PT TCUP cannot find protection under the BIT, so
the Respondent submits, because it was obtained after the revocation decrees of
4 May 2010. According to the Respondent, PT TCUP amended its articles of association
on 16 April 2010 to authorize a capital increase and issue new shares. That amendment
was approved by the Minister of Law and Human Rights on 15 June 2010, and only
thereafter did PT ICD obtain a 99.01% direct interest in PT TCUP and Churchill the
remaining 0.99%.

Thus, the Claimant is barred from invoking any rights in respect to its interest in PT TCUP.
as it acquired the shares in PT TCUP when the mining licenses were already revoked.

2. The Claimant’s position

2.1 The Claimant’s investments have been admitted in accordance with the BIT

For the Claimant, Indonesia fails to explain the content of the admission requirement under
the BIT and conflates that requirement with the larger legality requirement.**

2.2 The meaning of the “admission” requirement

The Claimant submits that, in ordinary usage and in light of the context in the
Uk-Indonesia BIT, the term “admitted” means “allowed” or “approved for entry”.°?
Therefore, the admission requirement is applicable at the time when making the

investment and, once approved, the investment is covered by the BIT.*°

. To support its interpretation of the term “admitted”, the Claimant relies on similarly worded

provisions in the Australia-New Zealand-ASEAN FTA*" and the ASEAN Comprehensive
Investment Agreement.* The Claimant also relies on Desert Line Projects v. Yemen,
where the tribunal found that, in the absence of a specifically defined manner of certifying
acceptance, a general endorsement of the investment at the highest level of the State
satisfies the admission requirement.*® Finally, the Claimant disputes Indonesia’s reliance
on Gruslin v. Malaysia and Yaung Chi Oo Trading Pte Ltd v. Myanmar, because the facts
underlying the present dispute are different.**

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s expansive reading of the admission requirement,
which it seemingly convolutes with the “in accordance with the law” requirement: “[I]t is our
submission that once this admission is granted, the investment activity can commence
within Indonesia without the need for further admissions. Indeed the whole point of
admission is a singular act. If separate admissions were required for all investments
subsequently, this would amount to a compliance with law requirement, which has been

explicitly distinguished by authorities and also, of course, by a plain meaning of the

term”.26

. Therefore, relying on Hamester v. Ghana, the Claimant insisted on the distinction between

“legality at the time of the initiation of the investment” and “legality during the performance
of the investment”,*® the first aspect relating to jurisdiction and the second one to the
merits.

2.3 All investments were granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign
Capital Investment Law and the 2007 Investment Law

According to the Claimant, all of its investments have been established in accordance with
the relevant foreign investment laws and granted admission by the competent authorities.
PT ICD was granted a BKPM Approval in 2005 and received a Permanent Business
License in 2007. After PT ICD’s acquisition by Churchill and Planet in 2006, BKPM again
granted its approval. All further investment activities also received authorization by the
relevant authorities.

In support, the Claimant recalls that under both the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment
Law*®” and the 2007 Investment Law which replaced it,° the BKPM is the agency with
authority to grant admission to foreign investors in Indonesia.*?

Relying on the 2005 BKPM Approval, the Claimant further submits that PT ICD received
the authorization to engage in mining activities for a period of 30 years. In that regard,
Dr. Makarim points out that “once the BKPM issued its 2006 Approval and the MEMR
issued a Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Mining Business License, PT ICD was admitted
into Indonesia under the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law”.°” Dr. Makarim further
states that none of PT ICD’s subsequent investment activity required additional approvals
to fulfill the admission requirement under the BIT.*”'

- The 2006 Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Mining Business License from the Ministry
of Energy and Mineral Resources;

- The 2007 BKPM Permanent Business License; and

- The 2011 Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Mining Business License from the Ministry
of Energy and Mineral Resources.°”*

276. In each of these approvals or licenses, PT ICD’s foreign shareholding is explicitly

mentioned, a clear recognition by Indonesia that these approvals concerned an investment
by foreigners.°”°

277. In addition to disputing that it engaged in mining activities per se in violation of the relevant

mining licenses, the Claimant argues that Indonesia’s allegation that it circumvented the
law by restructuring the investment — besides being wrong — has no bearing on the
fulfillment of the admission requirement.

278. Furthermore, the Claimant disputes that PT ICD could only engage in mining activities in

372

the coal sector by concluding a PKP2B with the Government;*“ that PT ICD’s mining
license only covered mining services in a limited sense;°”° that Churchill engaged in mining
activity without permission;*”° and that the contractual arrangements with the Ridlatama

companies violated Article 33 of the 2007 Investment Law.*””

2.4 The Claimant’s investments have otherwise been made in accordance with

2.4.1 The UK-Indonesia BIT contains no legality requirement

279. The Claimant stresses that Indonesia does not contest that the UK-Indonesia BIT contains

280.

28

no express legality requirement.*” In the absence of such requirement, the Claimant puts
forward that Indonesia “cannot claim plausibly that any illegality in the Claimant[’s]
investment, other than lack of proper admission, would deprive this Tribunal of
jurisdiction’.°”? The Claimant also notes that Indonesia has failed to substantiate its
position with a single authority, except for references where the definition of investment

included a legality requirement.

2.4.2 Churchill never performed mining per se

The Claimant challenges Indonesia’s allegations that it engaged in mining operations
without the necessary authorizations. There is no evidence showing what activities qualify
as mining services as opposed to actual mining: “Where in the process from prospecting
for coal [...] to the extraction and sale of coal, can it be said that mining services starts or
stops; or which activities within the process from start to finish are services as opposed to

actual mining?”**"

. In any event, the Claimant denies having performed mining per se, save for drilling in

conformity with the KP Exploration Licenses granted to the Ridlatama companies.* At the
hearing, it recalled that the licenses were revoked when only 20 percent of the territory
[covered by them] had been fully explored. No mine was ever opened. No mine was ever

operational. No coal was ever mined from the East Kutai Coal Project”.*

2.4.3 The Respondent's accusations of document forgery are not supported by
evidence

282. The Claimant strongly rejects the Respondent's accusations raised during the hearing

28:

oe

&

a

regarding allegedly forged documents in the record. It explains that some document
irregularities may be due to clerical errors made by officials in the Regency of East Kutai.
Notwithstanding, the fact that the Respondent has not acted on these accusations much
earlier is sufficient to rebut them. °*

2.4.4 The Respondent's objection could only have a bearing on the merits, not

on jurisdiction

Finally, the Claimant contends that Indonesia’s reliance on World Duty Free v. Kenya and
Plama v. Bulgaria is misleading to the extent that its introduction of the legality requirement
at the jurisdictional stage conflates jurisdiction with admissibility, which is a merits issue.°%
The Tribunal should not refuse to afford Churchill a forum to adjudicate its claims. In any
event, Indonesia has not reserved admissibility as a preliminary question, which could
therefore only affect the merits if at all.

3. Analysis

Having determined that Indonesia has given its advance consent to ICSID arbitration under
Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT, the Tribunal must now determine the scope of
Indonesia's consent in light of Indonesia’s second jurisdictional objection. It must in
particular determine whether Churchill’s investment is covered by the Treaty.

In light of the Parties’ arguments, the Tribunal will first analyze Article 2(1) of the Treaty so
as to determine the meaning of the words “granted admission” (3.1.). Thereafter, it will turn
to the Indonesian Foreign Capital Investment Law referred to in Article 2(1) of the BIT
(3.2.) and to the BKPM Approvals (3.3.).

3.1 The admission requirement under Article 2(1) of the BIT

286. Article 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT reads as follows:

384
385

Tr. 14052013, 77:20-25.

“This Agreement shall only apply to investments by nationals or
companies of the United Kingdom in the territory of the Republic of
Indonesia which have been granted admission in accordance with the

Foreign Capital Investment Law No. 1 of 1967 or any law amending
or replacing it”.%°

It is common ground that Article 2(1) limits the application of the BIT to investments that
have been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law
(or any successive statute). By contrast, the Parties are in disagreement on the temporal
scope of application of Article 2(1), i.e. whether the requirement implies admission once
upon entry into the country, as argued by the Claimant, or whether it extends through the
entire duration of the investment operation, as advocated by the Respondent.

In accordance with the rules of treaty interpretation, the Tribunal will start by ascertaining
the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 2(1). This provision requires an investment to
“have been granted admission” by Indonesia under the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment
Law. According to the Oxford Dictionary of English, the verb “to admit” means “to allow’ or
“to accept”.**” That same dictionary defines the noun “admission” as “the process or fact of

entering or being allowed to enter a place or organization”.°*

. The content of this definition and the observation that the admission must “have been

granted” by the host State, leads the Tribunal to understand that the admission
requirement set forth in Article 2(1) is a one-time occurrence, a gateway through all British
investors must pass once.

The context confirms this understanding. Article 2 is entitled “Scope of the Agreement’,
implying that investments that do not meet the requirements under Article 2 will not find
protection under the UK-Indonesia Treaty, even if the underlying operation qualifies as an
investment under Article 1(1). The admission requirement is consequently of jurisdictional
nature. As such, it necessarily applies at the time of entry into the country and not during
the entire operation of the project. This conclusion is further confirmed by previous arbitral
decisions.°*°

Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal addresses certain additional arguments and
cases which the Parties invoked. In this context, it agrees with the Claimant that the
admission requirement embodied in Article 2(1) is narrower than a traditional legality
requirement in the sense that it only demands admission in accordance with the relevant
domestic laws and not general compliance with the host State’s legislation.

Contrary to the Respondent's position, the Tribunal does not find that Mytilineos, Gruslin,
and Yaung Chi Oo support the Respondent’s argument. In Mytilineos, the tribunal was
called upon to interpret a general “in accordance with the legislation” provision contained in
the Greece-Yugoslavia BIT and the tribunal expressly mentioned that the treaty did not
require any registration of investments.°°°

The Gruslin decision is also inapposite here. It is true that the Belgium-Malaysia
Intergovernmental Agreement under scrutiny there required that the assets be invested in
Malaysia in an “approved project” classified as such by the relevant Ministry.*°*' The sole
arbitrator found that this requirement was not satisfied through a general approval of the
business activity, but that the specific “project” needed approval.*°? In the view of the
Tribunal, Gruslin must be distinguished, since the thrust of Indonesia’s argument is that
Churchill violated Indonesian laws after the approval of its investment, not in the making of
the investment.

Finally, in Yaung Chi Oo, the tribunal refused jurisdiction on the ground that the investment
had not obtained an additional approval in line with the requirements of the 1987 ASEAN
Agreement.** It held that all investors, including those who were already admitted in
Myanmar prior to the entry into force of the ASEAN Agreement, had to apply for approval
in conformity with Article 1I(3) of that treaty to benefit from treaty protection.°* The investor

failed to do so and, hence, jurisdiction was denied.*°°

In sum, none of these cases support Indonesia’s argument that the admission requirement
extends throughout the duration of the investor's activity. In other words, the admission
requirement under Article 2(1) of the treaty is restricted to the time of the initiation of the
investment. The Tribunal must thus analyze the content of the admission requirement
under the relevant legislation.

3.2 The Indonesian Foreign Investment Law

. Foreign investment in Indonesia is governed by the 1967 Foreign Investment Law.° This

law was amended in 1970 in respect of matters of no relevance here,*°” and then replaced
on 26 April 2007 by the Investment Law No. 25 (“2007 Investment Law’).* As to the 2007
Investment Law, the Respondent acknowledges that it does not diverge significantly from
its predecessor, save for the addition of Article 33.°°°

It is common ground that Churchill acquired its interests in PT ICD on 24 April 2006 and
that it obtained the BKPM Approval for this acquisition on 8 May 2006,‘ i.e. before the
entry into force of the 2007 Investment Law. The Tribunal will thus assess the present
objection by application of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law.

. Article 1 of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law provides that it applies to “direct foreign

capital investment” made in Indonesia.*” Article 2 defines foreign capital investment as
including (a) foreign exchange, (b) equipment, and (c) transferable profits used to finance
an enterprise in Indonesia.*” Article 3 defines an enterprise as understood in Article 2 as a
legal entity organized under Indonesian law and domiciled in Indonesia. Under Articles 4
and 5 of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, the Indonesian Government is empowered to
determine the operating area for foreign capital and the fields of activity which are open to
foreign investment.

Law No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (Exh. CLA-2; Exh. RLA-006). See RMOJ, § 41. The
Parties submitted different English versions of the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law. However,
neither Party indicated that there is any material difference between the two translations.

Regarding the field of mining activities, Article 8(1) of the law requires cooperation with the
Government by way of a work contract or otherwise:

“Foreign investment in the field of mining shall be carried out in
cooperation with the Government on the basis of a work contract
(“kontrak karya’) or other form in accordance with revailing [sic]
regulations”.“°°

Finally, about the implementation of the law, Article 28(1) provides for coordination in the
following terms:

“Provisions of this Law shall be implemented by coordination among
the Government agencies concerned in order to ensure
harmonization of Government policies regarding foreign capital”.

. Article 28(2) specifies that further provisions will be adopted in respect of procedures for

the coordination contemplated in paragraph 1. The elucidation to Article 28, which is
appended to the law, contemplates the creation of a coordination body. It states that the
“execution of the Law involves the domains of several Department [sic]. For that reason it
is necessary to have a simple coordination body which may take the form of a council
consisting of the Ministers concerned”.*°

This being so, the 1967 Foreign Investment Law does not specify the procedures for a
foreign investor to obtain the governmental approval contemplated in Article 2(1) of the
Uk-Indonesia BIT, nor does it designate an authority in charge of implementing the law.
The Parties agree that the BKPM, the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board, is the
responsible authority to grant the investment approvals contemplated in Article 2(1) of the
UK-Indonesia BIT.“°

In this respect, the Tribunal notes that, according to the Respondent, the BKPM was only
created in 1973.“ It further notes that, under the 1981 Presidential Decree No. 33
regarding the Capital Investment Coordinating Board, the BKPM has the duty to assist

Indonesia’s President in formulating investment policies, completing investment approvals
and evaluating their implementation, and issuing business licenses.*®

In 2004, a so-called “One-Roof Service System” was established by Presidential Decree
No. 29.“°° According to that decree, the BKPM had delegated authority from the relevant
Ministries to issue capital investment approvals under the 1967 Foreign Investment Law.
Article 3 of the decree provides that:

“Services of capital investment approvals, permits and facilities as
referred to in Article 2 letter c within the framework of Foreign Capital
Investment and Domestic Capital Investment are carried out by
BKPM, based on delegation of authority by the Minister/Head of Non
Departmental Government Institution which fosters the relevant lines
of business of capital investment through the one-roof service
system”.“"°

Article 4 Decree No. 29 further provides that decentralized governmental bodies may also
delegate the authority to grant investment approvals to the BKPM:

“Governor/Regent/Mayor in line with his/her authority may delegate
authority in investment approval, licenses and facilities services as
meant in Article 2 letter c to BKPM (Investment Coordinating Board)
through the one-stop service system”.*"'

In the field of mining, the Ministry of Mining had delegated its authority to the BKPM in
1978 already.*"? As a result of this delegation and of the powers vested in the BKPM under
the Decrees of 1981 and 2004, when Churchill applied for its investment approval, the
BKPM was the authority competent to grant that approval.

and 3(!) (Exh. RLA-099: Exh. CLA-366).

Framework of Foreign Capital Investment and Domestic Capital Investment through the One-Roof
Service System (Exh. C-361; Exh. RLA-106). Article 1(5) of the Decree defines the One-Roof
Service System as “a system of the services of granting capital investment approvals and
implementation permits carried out by one Government institution charged with responsibilities in
the field of capital investment”.

. Consequently, the Tribunal must now determine whether Churchill obtained the investment

approval from the BKPM in conformity with Article 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT, thus
enabling it to benefit from protection under the treaty.

3.3. The BKPM Approvals

It is undisputed that, pursuant to Article 3 of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, Churchill
could only invest in Indonesia through a local vehicle incorporated and domiciled in
Indonesia.“"* It is equally undisputed that foreign investors seeking to invest in the mining
sector can only do so through a foreign direct investment company, a so-called
Penanaman Modal Asing (“PMA’).

Churchill invested in Indonesia by acquiring a 95% share in an Indonesian PMA called PT
Indonesian Coal Development or PT ICD. PT ICD was initially created by Profit Point
Group Ltd, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi,
an Indonesian national.“"* Profit Point Group Ltd owned 95% of the shares and
Mr. Andreas Rinaldi the remaining 5%.

The Respondent acknowledges that PT ICD “received an approval from BKPM to be a
Penanaman Modal Asing (PMA — foreign direct investment) company, operating as a
Perseroan Terbatas (PT — limited liability company)”.“® The BKPM approved the
incorporation of PT ICD on 23 November 2005 (the “2005 BKPM Approval”).*"° The
preamble of the 2005 BKPM Approval refers to (1) the 1967 Foreign Investment Law,
(2) the 1967 Mining Law, (3) the 1981 Presidential Decree No. 33 on the BKPM, (4) the
2004 Presidential Decree No. 29 on the One-Roof Service System, and (5) the 1978
Decree on the delegation of powers from the Ministry of Mining to the BKPM.*"”

. The text of the 2005 BKPM Approval mentions the identity of the two applicants, the terms

of the project, the name of the new company PT ICD, its business field, the initial capital

contribution of USD 250,000%"° and contains the investment approval in the following

terms:
“The Government of the Republic of Indonesia grants investment
approval, which is also applicable as Temporary License until the
company obtains Permanent Business License”.**

On 24 April 2006, the owners of PT ICD sold their shares to Churchill (95%) and to Planet

(5%).*”° The change in shareholders was approved by the BKPM on 8 May 2006 (the
“2006 BKPM Approval”),“*" a fact that the Respondent concedes. Besides requiring that,
within fifteen years from the start of commercial operations, PT ICD must sell part of its
shares to Indonesian citizens, and that any subsequent change in the share capital must
be approved by the BKPM, the 2006 BKPM Approval incorporates by reference the
content of the 2005 BKPM Approval.

On this basis, and in particular in view of the fact that PT ICD received the necessary
approval by the BKPM in 2005 and that the change in PT ICD’s shareholding was
subsequently approved by the BKPM in 2006, the Tribunal concludes that Churchill
obtained the necessary approval when making its investment in May 2006, thus fulfilling
the requirement set in Article 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT.

Therefore, the Tribunal denies Indonesia’s second preliminary objection and concludes
that it has jurisdiction over the present dispute.

The present decision is limited to jurisdiction and does not prejudge any alleged
wrongdoing by the Claimant during the operation of the investment, which is a matter for
the merits.

COSTS

With regard to costs, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal:

“order [Churchill] to pay the totality of costs relating to this Arbitration,
including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal,

317. For its part, the Claimant makes the following requests:

and of ICSID as well as legal and other expenses incurred by the
[Churchill] on a full indemnity basis, plus interest accrued thereupon

reserve the decision on costs for a later decision.
