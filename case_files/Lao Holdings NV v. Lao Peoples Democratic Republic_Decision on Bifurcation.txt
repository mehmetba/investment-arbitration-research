Re: Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People’s Democratic Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/16/2)

Dear Sirs and Madam,

The Tribunal has received the parties completed exchanges on the Respondent’s Notice of
Objections to Jurisdiction and Request for Bifurcation of February 21, 2017. As agreed by the
parties during the first session on March 7, 2017, the Tribunal hereby issues its decision on the
Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation dispensing with its reasons.

Having reviewed the parties’ submissions on the matter, the Tribunal denies the
Respondent’s request for Bifurcation. The Tribunal requests the parties to keep it informed of any
ruling rendered in the other proceedings, without prejudice to the parties making arguments in the
future regarding the weight to be given to any such decision or the implication of any such decision
for the breath of inquiry in this case.

In the meantime, the Tribunal confirms that the plenary (jurisdiction and merits) hearing
in this case will be held between May 21-27, 2018 in Singapore, pursuant to Annex 1| of Procedural
Order No. 1 and the parties’ respective correspondence of April 13 and April 21, 2017, confirming
their availability on such dates. With respect to the possible adjustments in pre-hearing dates
referenced in Respondent's correspondence of April 21, 2017, the Tribunal requests the
Respondent to confer promptly with the Claimant regarding any such reasonable request for
adjustments, with an eye towards providing the Tribunal if possible with agreed adjustments no
later than May 3, 2017. The Tribunal will finalize Annex A thereafter.

Yours sincerely,
[Signed]

Anneliese Fleckenstein
Secretary of the Tribunal
