INTRODUCTION

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Energy Charter
Treaty, which entered into force on 16 April 1998 with respect to the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Spain (the “ECT”), and the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of

Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The claimants are Hydro Energy 1 S.a rl. (“Hydro Energy”), a private limited
company (société a responsabilité limitée) incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg,
and Hydroxana Sweden AB (“Hydroxana”), a private limited liability company

(Aktiebolag) incorporated under the laws of Sweden (together, the “Claimants”).
The respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain” or the “Respondent’”).

The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties”.

The Parties’ representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

This dispute relates to measures implemented by the Respondent that modified the
regulatory and economic regime applicable to producers of hydropower generation
energy, which allegedly negatively impacted the Claimants’ investment (equity and
debt interests) in various Spanish companies that own and operate thirty-three
hydropower generation plants in Spain with a total installed production capacity of

106.788 megawatts.

The Claimants allege that Spain has breached its obligations under Article 13 of the
ECT by means of the indirect expropriation of their investment. They also submit that
the Respondent has failed to comply with the following obligations under Article 10(1)
of the ECT: (a) to accord fair and equitable treatment, () not to impair by unreasonable
or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal
of the Claimants’ investment, and (c) to accord the most constant protection and
security. The Claimants seek compensation for damage caused as a result of the

Respondent’s violations of the ECT.

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 10 of 298

In its Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum dispatched to the
Parties on 9 March 2020 (the “Decision”) the Tribunal, having declared it has
jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims in the present arbitration and dismissing the

Claimants’ claim under ECT Article 13(1), went on to declare and direct as follows:

(3) the Tribunal declares that the Respondent might (or would)
be in breach of ECT, Article 10(1), if and to the extent that the
remuneration of each of the plants in the Ondina and Xana
portfolios failed to accord with a reasonable post-tax rate of
return in the small-hydro market in Spain on the basis of WACC
plus 1%, with the risk-free rate being the Spanish 10 year bond
rate of 4.398%;

(4) the Tribunal accordingly directs the Parties to endeavour to
agree on the bases in Section VIII B hereof (i) an agreed post-
tax reasonable rate of return calculated using the WACC as
at June 2013; and (ii) agreed post-tax holding IRRs for each of
the plants; !

The Tribunal gave directions for the Parties to report to the Tribunal within 60 days
as to whether agreement had been reached and, if not, on the principal areas of
disagreement. The Tribunal also stated it would give such further directions as may

be necessary.

The Decision constitutes an integral part of this Award and it is hereby incorporated as
Annex A. The Decision sets out the full procedural history of this arbitration, the factual
background to the dispute, the submissions made by the Parties and the Parties’

respective requests for relief. In consequence, none of that is repeated here.

In this Award, unless the context otherwise requires, the Tribunal adopts the

abbreviations used in the Decision.

POST-DECISION PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 26 March 2020, the Parties notified the Tribunal that, in order to facilitate
discussions between the Parties and their respective experts, with a view to reaching
agreement within the timeframe set by the Tribunal (i.e., by 8 May 2020), the Parties

had agreed the following protocol:

' Decision, 1770.

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 11 of 298

1. By Monday 30 March 2020, the Parties’ respective quantum
experts shall seek to agree a schedule for discussions on the
issues identified by the Tribunal.

2. By Monday 4 May 2020, the Parties’ experts shall endeavour
to reach agreement on the identified issues and prepare a joint
memorandum that identifies areas of agreement and any areas of
disagreement that remain, along with reasons for the
disagreement.

3. By Friday 8 May 2020, the Parties shall submit a joint
communication to the Tribunal, providing a copy of the experts’
joint memorandum and, if necessary, proposing a procedural
timetable for submissions on any areas of disagreement.

4. All discussions and drafts exchanged between the experts, and
with and between the Parties, in accordance with this protocol
shall be on a “without prejudice” basis, such that only the final
agreed joint memorandum may be presented to the Tribunal.

On 24 April 2020, the Parties sought an extension of time of 14 days to the deadlines
contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the agreed protocol which was granted by the

Tribunal on the same day.

On 22 May 2020, the Parties submitted to the Tribunal the experts’ final Joint
Memorandum dated 22 May 2020 (the “Joint Memorandum”), together with the Joint
Excel Model referred to therein (the “Joint Model”). The Parties also stated that they
did not consider further submissions were necessary in light of the positions taken in the
Joint Memorandum, but that should the Tribunal deem further submissions helpful,
the Parties would be happy to liaise in order to agree a procedural timetable for

such submissions.

The Claimants stated that if the Tribunal wished to hear orally from the experts and
counsel in relation to the remaining areas of disagreement, a virtual hearing of up to a
maximum of one day would be appropriate. The Respondent stated it did not consider

a hearing to be necessary.

On 10 June 2020, the Tribunal notified the Parties that it did not require a

further hearing.

On 17 June 2020, the Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on the

admissibility of a new document, namely the Decision on Annulment issued on

11 June 2020 in Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energia Solar Luxembourg S.a r.l. v
Kingdom of Spain, CSID Case No. ARB/13/36. On 22 June 2020, the Claimants filed
observations on the Respondent’s request of 17 June 2020. On 23 June 2020, the

Tribunal decided on the admissibility of the new document.
On 24 June 2020, each Party filed an updated statement of costs.

On 22 July 2020, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed.

THE JOINT MEMORANDUM

dd) Areas of Agreement and Disagreement

The Joint Memorandum contains a few areas of agreement between the experts, but
significant areas of disagreement such that detailed analysis of the arguments of the
Parties’ experts set out in the Joint Memorandum is necessary for the Tribunal to

determine the compensation due to the Claimants.
The experts do agree:

(1) That the internal rate of return (“IRR”) is to be computed for each individual plant,
post-tax, and that the IRR is to be computed based on the value of the plants as of
June 2013 and the projected free cash flows to the firm that each individual plant is
expected to generate from June 2013 through the end of their concession in what is

described as the “actual” scenario; and

(2) To use the cash flows previously modelled in these proceedings under the “actual”

scenario to project cash flows.”

The experts also agree that wherever possible, they use cash flow components for
individual plants. Where financial statements and cash flow forecasts are aggregated at
the portfolio level, they allocate cash flow forecasts to individual plants based on their

installed capacity and projected cash flows.*

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 13 of 298

The experts disagree, however, on how to compute the post-tax reasonable rate of return
(“PTRRR’) of the individual plants and on the post-tax holding IRRs achieved by the
individual plants in the “actual” scenario. This is, principally, because they cannot agree
how to calculate the value of the individual plants as of June 2013 and, much less
significantly, whether to compute the IRRs for all plants separately or to combine cash

flows for (i) the Porma and Ferreras plants and (ii) the Baga and Pendis plants.*

Once the PTRRR and the IRRs are calculated, the experts do agree on the overall
methodology to calculate the economic impact of the disputed measures on the
individual plants as of June 2013 according to the Decision, namely that, following the
Tribunal’s instructions, the actual IRRs of the individual plants are compared to the
PTRRR. However, differences between the experts remain as to three parameters in the

calculation of the economic impact of the disputed measures on the individual plants:
(1) Whether to include or exclude compensation for the Alange plant;
(2) Whether the discount rate used should be equal to or different than the PTRRR; and

(3) Whether to cap the PTRRR for individual plants at the IRR that would have been
achieved under RD 661/2007.5

Finally, the experts disagree on whether compensation due to the Claimants must be
computed as arising from their equity and debt investments, or whether compensation
due to the Claimants is equal to the economic impact of the disputed measures on

the plants.°

In addition to the Joint Memorandum, the experts have also provided the Tribunal with
a Joint Model which they say has
built-in options that can be used to select different permutations

of the foregoing areas of disagreement, and to visualize the
resulting compensation calculation.”

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 14 of 298

Prior to considering each of the areas of disagreement between the experts, the Tribunal
notes that, notwithstanding their differences, both experts conclude that, in respect of
some of the small-hydro plants at least, in both portfolios, the remuneration of those
plants would fail to accord with a reasonable post-tax rate of return going forward from

the New Regime and, in consequence, compensation is due to the Claimants.

In consequence, and in accordance with the conclusions reached by the Tribunal in the

Decision, the Respondent is in breach of ECT Article 10(1).

The manner in which each expert has calculated the compensation due to the Claimants,
and the results of those calculations, is set out very briefly in the following paragraphs.
Having done that, the Tribunal considers in detail the areas of difference between the
experts and, by applying its findings in respect of each of those areas of differences to

the Model, concludes what compensation is due to the Claimants from the Respondent.

Professor Spiller of Compass Lexecon is the Claimants’ expert and Dr Flores,

previously of Econ One and now of Quadrant Economics, is the Respondent’s expert.

(2) Summary of Compensation Calculation

Each expert provides a figure for a PTRRR, but calculated in different ways. Each
expert provides figures for the value of the individual small-hydro plants in the Xana
and Ondina portfolios, but calculated in different ways. Each expert arrives at a figure

for compensation due to the Claimants, but calculated on different bases.

Professor Spiller calculates the PTRRR at 7.97% and, having done so, concludes
that the impact of the disputed measures on the individual plants amounts to
EUR 160,597,000 as of 1 June 2013. Professor Spiller, however, provides an
alternative calculation which caps the plants’ returns such that the “but-for”
remuneration of each plant does not exceed the return based on the original
RD 661/2007 regulation (i.e., if a plant’s IRR under the RD 661/2007 remuneration is
less than 7.97%, Professor Spiller adopts the IRR under RD 661/2007 as the target rate

of return).?

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 15 of 298

His rationale for this approach is that since the IRR expected to be obtained by some of
the Claimants’ plants under RD 661/2007 might be lower than the PTRRR, a
mechanical application of the PTRRR for such plants could produce returns higher than
those which they would have received under RD 661/2007, a result which Professor

Spiller considers may be contrary to the intentions of the Tribunal.!?

Applying this cap, in effect, means that no plants would be granted returns higher than
those which they were receiving under RD 661/2007 (with the overall impact of
reducing damages). It prevents the scenario in which the “but-for” returns for certain
plants, according to the Tribunal’s methodology, would have been higher than the
returns being obtained under the regulation before the disputed measures were

implemented. '!

Using this cap, Professor Spiller calculates that the impact of the disputed measures on

the individual plants amounts to EUR 88,556,000. !

Having made that calculation, Professor Spiller goes on to note that the Claimants hold
equity and debt investments in the portfolio companies that hold the plants and, in order
to compute the compensation due to the Claimants, one must take into account the

impact of the disputed measures on the Claimants’ financial debt. '*

Professor Spiller explains that the operating companies which own the Xana and
Ondina portfolios restructured their debts, meaning that the debt holders absorbed part
of the impact of the disputed measures on the plants’ cash flows. He states that if one
were to assess compensation to the Claimants exclusively by focusing on the economic
impact on the plants (i.e., without focusing on damages to the Claimants), one would
not be accounting for mitigation to those plant-level damages that was achieved through
the debt restructuring in the “actual” scenario. To account for such mitigation,
Professor Spiller computes the compensation due to the Claimants as the sum of the

impact of the disputed measures on their equity and debt investments. '*

Professor Spiller total d to the Clai ” equity in at
EUR 37,057,000 as of 1 June 2013 based on the capped calculation. He argues,
therefore, that the equity holders were able to mitigate the impact of the disputed
measures by approximately EUR 51.5 million!» by getting lenders to absorb this portion
of damages through the restructuring of the portfolio companies’ financial debt. As the
Claimants also hold a debt investment, Professor Spiller states that they absorbed a part
of the burden that was shifted to lenders and suffered damages to debt holdings of
EUR 4,362,000.!°

Professor Spiller concludes by saying:

In spite of suffering damages to its debt holdings of
EUR 4.4 million, Claimants’ net mitigation remains significant,
at EUR 47.1 million. In other words, this net mitigation has to be
deducted from the overall damages to the plants to accurately
reflect the actual losses suffered by the Claimants as a result of
the Measures. !”

Based on the capped calculation, Professor Spiller assesses total damages to the
Claimants’ equity investments at EUR 37,057,000 as of 1 June 2013, and damages to

the Claimants’ debt investment at EUR 4, 362,000 as of 1 June 2013, making a total of
EUR 41,419,000.!8

If the same calculation were to be carried out without applying the cap, the
equivalent figure for damages to the Claimants’ equity and debt investments would be

EUR 98,199,000."

Accordingly, depending on the approach taken, Professor Spiller provides a selection

of quantum amounts ranging from EUR 160,597,000 to EUR 41,419,000.

Notwithstanding the Tribunal’s directions to do so,”° Dr Flores has not calculated a
PTRRR based on WACC plus 1% with the risk free rate being the Spanish 10 year bond

rate of 4.398%. The extent of Dr Flores analysis and calculation is as follows:

As I have explained in these proceedings, the reasonable

profitability rates in the renewable energy sector since the early

2000s have been around 7% post-tax. Hence the PTRRR is 7%.7!
Dr Flores calculates the IRRs of the individual plants in the Xana and Ondina portfolios
and, using those IRRs, calculates the compensation that would be required as of
June 2013 to achieve his 7% PTRRR. For the Xana portfolio, the compensation figure
he calculates is EUR 8,791,000 and for the Ondina portfolio EUR 369,000, making a
total of EUR 9,160,000.2

Having done so, however, Dr Flores argues that one of the plants in the Xana portfolio,
the Alange plant, should be excluded from the calculation because of poor performance
unrelated to the disputed measures.*> The compensation Dr Flores calculates for the
Alange plant is EUR 5,041,000.74 Thus, removing Alange results in compensation for
the Xana portfolio of EUR 3,750,000 and the Ondina portfolio of EUR 369,000, making
a total of EUR 4,119,000.25

Accordingly, depending on the approach taken, Dr Flores provides alternative quantum

amounts of either EUR 9,160,000 or EUR 4,119,000.

The Tribunal now turns to the calculation of the compensation due to the Claimants as
a result of this breach. In doing so, the Tribunal considers the approaches taken by each

of the experts in the Joint Memorandum with respect to the following issues:

(2) The value of the plants as of June 2013;

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

(1) The PTRRR

As already noted, Dr Flores has not calculated a PTRRR in the manner directed by
the Tribunal. Professor Spiller has done so, but his calculations are the subject of a
number of criticisms by Dr Flores. Accordingly, the Tribunal’s starting point is
Professor Spiller’s calculation of a PTRRR of 7.97% against which the criticisms of

Dr Flores will be evaluated.

Dr Flores notes that the RREEF v Spain”® tribunal calculated a PTRRR of 6.86% and
argues that Professor Spiller’s PTRRR of 7.97% is not consistent with the decision of
that tribunal because the levered WACC that Professor Spiller calculates assumes
financial risk from leverage, which was excluded from the WACC in RREEF v Spain.
Dr Flores says that Professor Spiller’s unlevered WACC, consistent with the
RREEF v Spain approach, would be 6.03% and adding a 1% premium would result in
a 7.03% PTRRR.?”

Dr Spiller’s response to this is that his WACC calculation does not assume financial
risk from leverage because his WACC is computed with a capital structure of 49% debt,
51% equity, which he says is comparable to the debt 60%/equity 40% used in
RREEF v Spain.** He says that his post-tax WACC of 6.97% is in line with the post-
tax WACC applied by the RREEF v Spain tribunal once the different methodological

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 19 of 298

approaches are accounted for. He states that the quantum experts in the RREEF v Spain
arbitration compute an unlevered WACC, which uses an unlevered beta (this is
because those experts apply a different methodological approach, while in the present
case the cash flows are discounted to account for leverage, and so a levered beta
is appropriate).

Professor Spiller confirms that his unlevered WACC as of June 2013, using the Spanish
risk-free rate of 4.398%, is 6.03%, which, he states, is in line with the 5.86% unlevered
WACC calculated by the RREEF v Spain tribunal.*° Using this figure would result in a
PTRRR of 7.03%.

In the Decision, the Tribunal indicated very clearly that it expected the approach
adopted in RREEF v Spain to be adopted in calculating the PTRRR®*! and that it
expected the PTRRR was likely to be somewhere in the region of 5.5% to 7%.*? One of
the factors which gave rise to that expectation was, as Dr Flores points out, when
evaluating the reasonable rate of return in his second report, Professor Spiller used a
PTRRR 6.24% as of 2013. Dr Flores then calculates that, based on the Spanish 10 year
bond rate of 4.398% specified in the Decision, the post-tax WACC would be 6.10% as
of 2013.7

The Tribunal considers that, taking all the arguments of the respective experts into
account, had the correct approach been taken by Professor Spiller in calculating the
WACC as at June 2013, the PTRRR would be much closer to 7% than to 8% which is

the result of Professor Spiller’s calculation of 7.97%.

As is explained in more detail later in this Award, the Parties have provided the Tribunal
with the Joint Model, which has been jointly agreed by the experts, in order to calculate
the compensation due to the Claimants. So far as the PTRRR is concerned, the Joint

Model only permits two options for the Tribunal to input: either 7.97% or 7%. Given

the arguments included in the Joint Memorandum by Professor Spiller, the Claimants

could have included input options of 7.03% or 7.10% as well, but have failed to do so.

In consequence, in choosing between the PTRRRs put forward by each expert, 7% by
Dr Flores and 7.97% by Professor Spiller, the Tribunal has concluded that the PTRRR
of 7% is the most likely to be correct. This is not as a result of the manner in which
Dr Flores has calculated that figure, but represents as close an approximation as
possible to the figure the Tribunal concludes would have been established had it been

correctly calculated by Professor Spiller.

(2) The Value of the Plants as of June 2013

To determine the value of the plants as of June 2013 Professor Spiller relies on the book
value of the plants as presented in the companies’ respective financial statements as of
a date as close to June 2013 as possible. Professor Spiller notes that the book value of
the assets, as reported in the financial statements, is an audited figure prepared by a
third party in the normal course of business. He also states that the book value is
independent of historical remuneration received by the plants, and so is consistent with

the instructions of the Tribunal** in this regard.°*

Professor Spiller justifies his use of book values as, under accounting rules, an asset’s
book value must be periodically assessed, and while it can be presented in financial
statements at a value lower than its fair market value, it cannot be presented at a value

higher than its fair market value. The book value has also been ratified by the auditors.*°

To establish the book value as of June 2013 Professor Spiller relies on the Xana
portfolio’s book value of EUR 35,000,000 as stated in its 31 May 2013 financial
statements and the Ondina portfolio’s book value of EUR 211,200,000 as stated in its

31 December 2012 financial statements.*”

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 21 of 298

There is no available book value data for the individual plants, and so Professor Spiller
allocates the book value among the plants pro rata based on the product of each of the

plant’s installed capacity and the number of years remaining on the concession.**

Dr Flores adopts an entirely different approach. He states that his calculation of the

value of the plants as of June 2013 is carried out as follows:

(i) Take the aggregate historical capital expenditures shown in
the financial statements of the entities holding each portfolio of
plants, calculated previously in these proceedings.

(ii) Allocate those aggregate historical capital expenditures to
individual plants based on the year the expenditure was incurred
and the year the plants were constructed.

(iii) Calculate the ratio of the remaining years of life as of June
2013 to the total years the individual plant was expected to
operate based on the end date of the relevant concession.

(iv) Multiply the historical capital expenditures by the ratio of
years remaining to total years.°°

The value of the plants as calculated by Dr Flores are EUR 34,800,000 for the Xana
portfolio and EUR 57,500,000 for the Ondina portfolio.

Dr Flores has two principal objections to the approach to valuation adopted by
Professor Spiller. The first is that, under Professor Spiller’s approach, non-cash
accounting adjustments are taken into account. Dr Flores asserts that non-cash
accounting adjustments that do not involve new capital expenditures should not be
considered in reasonable return calculations. His calculations, therefore, exclude any

non-cash accounting adjustments.

By way of example, Dr Flores refers to an adjustment that was made to the accounting

value of the Ondina portfolio in 2010.*°

Professor Spiller’s response is that accounting adjustments are a standard accounting

practice, subject to auditing, to reflect the persistent value of the plants, internalising

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 22 of 298

the long life of the plants and the investors’ expectations of their productivity and

profitability.*!

64. In support of his position, Professor Spiller quotes*? from Dr Flores’ First Report

which states:

Typically, an asset is recorded at actual historical cost. If the
value of that asset is perceived to be higher than the book value
at actual historical cost, then a company may revalue those
assets.*3

65. Professor Spiller further notes that the accounting adjustment of the Ondina portfolio
did not stem entirely from the 2010 revaluation as other revaluations also took place
previously, such as in 1999. He also points out that the revaluations were performed

prior to the Claimants’ acquisition.

66. Dr Flores also argues that PTRRR is meant to give a reasonable return on the cost of
constructing renewable energy facilities. He seeks to demonstrate this using an

example“ which is dealt with by Professor Spiller as follows:

Dr. Flores hypothesizes in paragraph 68 below that “if a hydro
plant were built in 2013 at a construction cost of EUR | million,
we would be interested in the reasonable return on that
EUR | million value, regardless of whether the plant’s
accountants and auditors later adjusted the book value of the
plant to EUR 2 million based on their own perceptions of market
value,” and that “calculating reasonable returns on a revalued
market value exceeding the construction cost would lead to
untenable results, as it would create the incentive for investors to
keep selling their plants to each other at higher and higher values
in order to obtain higher remuneration from the government.”
First, this example is illogical —if the value of such plants was
EUR 2 million, while they cost only EUR 1 million to build, then
the market would become flooded with investors who will invest
in new plants rather than bid up the price of already built plants.
Second, this example does not fit the case at hand, since if the
investment cost of the new plant was in fact EUR 1 million, and
the reasonable return was computed on that EUR 1 million
amount, then the value of the plants would not be EUR 2 million.
Third, and more importantly, as we have explained above, an

asset’s audited book value cannot be presented at a value higher
than its fair market value, and this value would have to be in line
with legitimate expectations. As such, Dr. Flores’s ever-
escalating-incentive argument is unrealistic and does not apply
to the case at hand.“
The Tribunal accepts Professor Spiller’s reasoning in respect of this example. As stated

in the Decision, the Tribunal considers that

the essence of the regime was that it was intended to promote,

and ensure the continuance of, renewables having a reasonable

rate of return for their future lifetime balanced against the cost to

the consumer.*°
The essence of the regime was not simply to encourage construction of new renewable
facilities, but also to ensure that investment was made in valuable and previously

constructed facilities in order to ensure they continued to produce renewable energy.

Dr Flores makes reference to the decisions of tribunals in a number of other arbitrations
brought against the Respondent arising out of the disputed measures,*” but these
decisions do not support Dr Flores’ proposition that the IRR is calculated on the cost of
constructing renewable energy facilities; they all refer to investment in renewable

energy facilities and rates of return on investments made.

The second objection raised by Dr Flores to the approach to valuation adopted by
Professor Spiller is that Professor Spiller ignores the information available on the actual
investment cost of the individual plants. Dr Flores argues that Professor Spiller ignores
available information regarding the historical investment cost of the individual plants
and ignores the fact, as Dr Flores contends, that older plants should comprise a smaller
share of the value as of June 2013 than newer plants. Dr Flores notes that this problem
affects mainly the Xana portfolio, the plants of which were constructed in the 1990s

and early 2000s and have a shorter useful life than those in the Ondina portfolio.*®

Professor Spiller disagrees and notes, in relation to the contention that older plants

should have a smaller share of the value, that an older hydro plant that has a very long

and productive useful life remaining would be much more valuable than a newer hydro
plant with a shorter useful life, given the same capacity and productivity.” There is

clear and obvious sense in this argument.

The Tribunal takes the view that, if the criticisms made by Dr Flores had serious merit,
a significant difference in the valuation of the Xana portfolio between Dr Flores and
Professor Spiller would be apparent, not least because the Xana portfolio is much more
modem than the Ondina portfolio. It appears that the Xana plants were put into
operation between 1990 and 2004, whereas the Ondina plants were put into operation
between 1906 and 1986.°° Accordingly, the historical data upon which Dr Flores
relies for the Xana portfolio are likely to be fairly accurate and, certainly, as stated
in paragraph 76 below, much more so than that for the Ondina portfolio. However,
as already noted, Dr Flores values the Xana portfolio at EUR 34,800,000 and
Professor Spiller values it at EUR 35,000,000.

As for Dr Flores’ overall approach of using historical capital expenditures on the plants,
Professor Spiller finds this approach to be unreliable and inappropriate for a number of
reasons. There is no consistent investment cost information for the plants from the time
of their construction, there is no adjustment for inflation, the focus on capital
expenditure disregards maintenance operational expenditure and capital expenditure is
depreciated which fails to recognise that, with proper maintenance, the productivity of

the plants does not deteriorate over time.*!

Dr Flores does not seek to defend these criticisms in detail but simply states that
although Professor Spiller claims that he excludes several components, the valuations

arrived at by both of them for the Xana portfolio are similar.

It is obvious that the respective values calculated by both experts for the Xana portfolio
will not assist the Tribunal in concluding which of the methods adopted to value the
plants as at June 2013 is correct. The different valuations of the Ondina portfolio,

however, do demonstrate that fundamentally different results will be obtained in certain

circumstances depending upon which method is adopted. Professor Spiller values it at

EUR 211,200,000 and Dr Flores at EUR 57,500,000.

As Professor Spiller points out, there is no information available for the Ondina
portfolio prior to 1989 despite 87% of the portfolio’s capacity being on line by 1930
and, in any event, the available capital expenditure figures for 1989 onwards are not
based on contemporary data but on financial statements from 1999 onwards.*? Dr Flores
does not dispute this and it is clear to the Tribunal, therefore, that the figures used by

Dr Flores for capital expenditure on the Ondina portfolio are inherently unreliable.

Also of significance is the question of operational maintenance expenditures on the
plants over the years which maintain productivity, extend useful life and must,
therefore, contribute to value. Professor Spiller asserts that Dr Flores disregards
maintenance expenditure by his focus solely on capital expenditure. Professor Spiller
states that relying solely on historical capital expenditures will thus severely
underestimate the value of the plants as of June 2013 as the undepreciated value
would not account for the fact that the maintenance expenditures have allowed the plant
to continue operating efficiently without serious degradation in capacity and

productivity.*?

Professor Spiller refers to Dr Flores’ First Report in which he notes that, including only
the actual historical capital investments, the book value of the Ondina plants will
decline to zero by 2017.* In contrast, Professor Spiller points out that the Ondina plants
are generating electricity productively, and have signed concession agreements

extending their useful lives up to 2061.°°

Professor Spiller also states that the Respondent itself has acknowledged in its cash
flow computations that the productivity of small-hydro plants does not degrade over

time. He points out that while Order 1045/2014 implements a 0.5% degradation rate for

technologies such as photovoltaic and wind turbines, it does not introduce such

degradation for hydroelectric plants.*°
Professor Spiller concludes by saying:

One way to include the value from maintenance expenditures in

the plants and any associated concession extensions is to include

the revaluations as reported in the audited financial statements.

Such book value revaluations are evident as far back as 1989,

and so even by that stage the plants were deemed to be worth

more than their depreciated historical cost. Revaluations account

for the value added by the maintenance of the plants between the

date of the historical investment and June 2013, and so must

be included.*”
It is clear to the Tribunal that the value of the plants stems from more than just the
historical capital expenditures alone. That is amply demonstrated by the conclusion that
the book value of the plants in the Ondina portfolio would be zero by 2017 if that

approach was taken.

Certainly, in relation to small-hydro plants, maintenance expenditure must be taken into
account in establishing the value of the plants. Dr Flores asserts that failing to take
account of maintenance expenditures is beside the point in a reasonable return
calculation,*® but his explanation which refers to a hydro plant costing EUR | million
to construct but which has a book value of EUR 2 million® is not convincing, as already

noted in paragraph 67 above.

Further, in one of the decisions to which Dr Flores refers, The PV Investors v The

Kingdom of Spain® the tribunal specifically states:

More specifically, Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law
provides for the achievement of “reasonable rates of return with
respect to the cost of money on the capital market”. Accordingly,
an investor is entitled to a return, i.e. it is entitled to make a profit
after having paid its capital and operating expenses.

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 27 of 298

The Ondina portfolio clearly had a value in 2011 when the Claimants acquired it, and
has a value today. Dr Flores’ approach to valuation seeks to calculate that value on the
basis of historic capital expenditure with the result that, by 2017 the Ondina portfolio
would have no value. There is no doubt that the historic capital expenditure figures used
by Dr Flores for the Ondina plants are unreliable, and his approach does not adequately
reflect the maintenance expenditure on the plants over the years which has preserved

their productivity and maintained their value.

It may be that the approach taken by Professor Spiller, which reflects accounting
adjustments in valuing the plants, is not entirely appropriate, and that his apportionment
of value between the individual plants, having used a portfolio book value, is not
entirely accurate. However, there is no doubt in the minds of the Tribunal that the
method adopted by Professor Spiller to calculate the value of the plants is more reliable

than that used by Dr Flores.

It is notable that, in the case of the Xana portfolio, comprising more modern plants than
those in the Ondina portfolio, and in respect of which Dr Flores had access to much
more accurate historical information, the valuations reached by the experts were almost
identical. In the minds of the Tribunal that indicates that whilst there may be some
unreliability in the approach taken by Professor Spiller, it is not significant and that the
Tribunal can, in consequence, rely upon Professor Spiller’s approach in determining

the value of the plants as at June 2013.

The Tribunal notes that, as an alternative to book value, a further input option for the
value of the plants has been provided for the Joint Model, namely the value implied by
the Claimants’ investment. No serious argument is provided in the Joint Memorandum
as to why the Tribunal should adopt this approach and the Tribunal notes that, to do so,
would increase the compensation to the Claimants. In the absence of any argument as

to why the implied value should be adopted, the Tribunal declines to do so.

(3) The Definition of Individual Plants

As Dr Flores notes, the experts largely agree upon the definition of individual plants

with two exceptions.°!

In the Xana Portfolio, two plants, Porma and Ferreras, share the same water flow and
Dr Flores considers they should be viewed as a single economic unit. He notes that
these two facilities were built at the same time, in 2004, and share the same water flow
from the Juan Benet reservoir and, in the technical due diligence, the production of
these two facilities is modelled jointly. Further, given that the two facilities were built
at the same time by the same corporate entity, there are insufficient data meaningfully

to separate out their respective actual investment costs.‘

In the Ondina Portfolio, two facilities, Baga and Pendis, share the same water flow and
Dr Flores considers they should be viewed as a single economic unit as Baga only
generates if Pendis is running at 100% load. Dr Flores states that Baga would never
achieve a reasonable rate of return if analysed separately from its sister facility, even
under RD 661/2007 and, therefore, from an economic point of view, it would be
incorrect to compensate Baga for a shortfall in return, given that that shortfall in return

would also have existed but for the disputed measures.*

Professor Spiller notes that the Tribunal requested post-tax holding IRRs for the
individual plants in the Ondina and Xana portfolios and, therefore, disagrees with
Dr Flores combining plants. He states that to combine Porma with Ferraras and Baga
with Pendis involves combining into single entities individual plants which have

different IT codes, and so are considered separate by the Spanish regulator.“

The Tribunal did request IRRs for the individual plants and, if individual plants are
considered separate by the Spanish regulator, the Tribunal sees no reason to combine

them for this purpose. Accordingly, the Tribunal adopts Professor Spiller’s approach.

(4) The Inclusion, or Otherwise, of the Alange Plant

Dr Flores states that the Alange plant has performed poorly for reasons unrelated to the
disputed measures and that, although it represents close to one fifth of the installed
capacity of the Xana portfolio, it is only operational for two to three months per year.
Dr Flores says that the failure of Alange to achieve a reasonable return stems from
insufficient water flow at its location and from its owner’s decision to give priority to
the nearby photovoltaic facility, and not from the failure of the regulatory regime to
provide a reasonable return. In fact, he says, had Alange continued to receive
remuneration according to RD 661/2007, as calculated by Professor Spiller, its IRR
would have been negative. Given this, Dr Flores’ view is that Alange needs to be
excluded from the compensation calculations, otherwise it would receive compensation

for cash flows that it would not have received in the absence of the disputed measures.°>

Professor Spiller disagrees with Dr Flores’ exclusion of Alange. In relation to
Dr Flores’ first point, Professor Spiller argues that the rationale for the present
assessment is that certain plants are receiving remuneration below a reasonable rate of
return in the “actual” scenario. Thus, the fact that Alange was making negative cash
flows in the “actual” scenario is not a reason to exclude the plant from the claim.
In relation to Dr Flores’ second point, Professor Spiller states that while Alange was
expected to achieve a -2.60% IRR under the RD 661/2007 remuneration, it was
expected to generate positive cash flows totalling EUR 2.3 million until the end of its
concession. He states that this means that it was generating positive value and,
therefore, from an economic perspective, contrary to Dr Flores’ contention, it would

have continued to operate.

The Claimants’ case in these proceedings has been that RD 661/2007 encouraged them
to make their investment in small-hydro plants in Spain. If, notwithstanding
RD 661/2007 a plant would not make a positive IRR and, indeed, as Dr Flores notes,
was only operational for 2 or 3 months each year, the Tribunal does not consider that it

should be in a better position post the disputed measures than it was under

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 30 of 298

RD 661/2007. Accordingly, the Tribunal agrees with Dr Flores that Alange should be

excluded from the compensation calculations.

(5) Discount Rates

Professor Spiller says that Dr Flores, rather than following the Tribunal’s instruction
and adopting a WACC lower than the PTRRR by 1% to discount future cash flows,
uses instead the same rate as the PTRRR (7%). Professor Spiller asserts that this negates
the RREEF v Spain tribunal’s dictum that investors “had legitimate expectations that
the return on their investment would be above the mere level of the WACC.”°
Furthermore, Professor Spiller argues, Dr Flores’ assumption goes directly against the
Tribunal’s instruction that the PTRRR and the discount rate or WACC have to differ

by 1%, and not have the same value.

Dr Flores does not engage in the debate over discount rates having acknowledged that

his approach is different to that of Professor Spiller.

Accordingly, for the reasons stated by Professor Spiller, the Tribunal adopts his
approach, namely that the discount rate should be 1% below the PTRRR. However, the
Tribunal has found that the PTRRR is 7% and, therefore, a discount rate lower than 7%
ought, therefore, to be applied. Again, however, the Tribunal is provided with only two
input options for the Joint Model. Having said that, given the Tribunal’s findings on all
the other matters in dispute between the experts, the Tribunal notes that the
compensation calculated by the Joint Model does not vary regardless of which input

is adopted.

(6) ‘Whether PTRRR Should be Capped at the RD 661/2007 Level

As noted above,” Professor Spiller points out that the IRR expected to be obtained by
some of plants under RD 661/2007 might be lower than the PTRRR, and, in
consequence, a mechanical application of the PTRRR for such plants could produce

returns higher than those they would have received under RD 661/2007. For this reason,

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 31 of 298

Professor Spiller includes an alternative computation that caps for each plant the
reasonable post-tax return at either the PTRRR or the IRR that such plant would have

received from the continuation of the RD 661/2007 regulations, whichever is lower.”!
Dr Flores states that:

I note that my conclusions are in line with the Tribunal’s
observation that “it seems more than likely that some
compensation is due to the Claimants in respect of some of the
plants in the Xana portfolio, even if none is due in respect of
Ondina. It is, of course, possible that a few Ondina plants may
be below the properly calculated reasonable rate of return and
compensation may be payable in respect of those individual
plants also...” My calculations show that several of the plants in
the Xana portfolio and two of the plants in the Ondina portfolio
do not reach the PTRRR.”

However, Dr Flores omits the commencement of, and conclusion of, that sentence from

the Decision. What the Tribunal actually said was:

If the disaggregation performed by Compass Lexecon is correct,
it seems more than likely that some compensation is due to the
Claimants in respect of some of the plants in the Xana portfolio,
even if none is due in respect of Ondina. It is, of course, possible
that a few Ondina plants may be below the properly calculated
reasonable rate of return and compensation may be payable in
respect of those individual plants also, depending on the validity
of the criticisms made of Econ One’s approach to calculating the
operational IRRs of the individual plants.”

As can be seen, therefore, that statement made by the Tribunal referred to a
disaggregation made by the Claimants’ expert of post-tax exit IRRs calculated by the
Respondent’s expert. No equivalent calculation had been conducted by the Claimants’
expert at the time and, in consequence, the IRRs calculated by the Respondent’s expert
were dependant on the values of the plants, as calculated by the Respondent’s expert.

As stated above, the Tribunal has found these values to be unreliable.

103. The main source of difference between Professor Spiller’s calculation of IRRs and the
IRRs calculated by Dr Flores is the value of the individual plants as of 2013. Dr Flores

accepts this is correct.”

104. The reason Dr Flores seeks to make the point as to the Tribunal’s original expectations
is that he considers the cap to be what he describes as an artificial partial correction to

Professor Spiller’s fundamentally flawed approach.”>

105. However, the Tribunal has already found that, of the two approaches to establishing the
value of the plants as at June 2013, the approach adopted by Professor Spiller is more
reliable than that adopted by Dr Flores. In consequence, whilst the approach to
valuation by Professor Spiller may lead to over-valuation of some plants, the cap
proposed by him ensures that no plants would be granted returns higher than those
which they were receiving under RD 661/2007. Dr Flores accepts that this is the effect
of the cap.”°

106. Accordingly, the Tribunal is comforted by the fact that, even if Professor Spiller’s
approach to valuation is not entirely correct, application of the cap ensures that the
Claimants are no better off than they were under RD 661/2007. The Tribunal, thus,

considers the cap should be applied.

(7) Whether a Further Calculation is Needed to Account for the Impact on
the Claimants’ Equity and Debt Investments in the portfolios

107. Dr Flores considers that calculating compensation at the plant level is consistent with
the Decision, and so no further calculations are required. He notes that Professor Spiller
proposes that further calculations are needed to take into account the equity and debt
held by the Claimants but states that the problem with his proposal is that his calculation
of debt is entirely independent of the parameters in dispute in the Joint Memorandum.
For example, he says, while the compensation to equity depends on the PTRRR the
Tribunal will ultimately decide to be appropriate (7% or 7.97%), the value of debt is
independent of that decision. Thus, had the Claimants characterised more of their

investment as debt instead of as equity at some point in the past (perhaps for tax-related

considerations), those cash flows would be insulated from loss and the Claimants would
now receive more compensation. That would not make sense from an economic

perspective, since the economic investment would be the same.””

Professor Spiller says that the Claimants hold equity and debt investments in the
portfolio companies that hold the plants and, in order to compute the compensation due
to the Claimants, one must take into account the impact of the disputed measures on the

company’s financial debt.”*

Professor Spiller explains that, as a result of the disputed measures, the Claimants’
operating companies restructured their debts, which meant that the debt holders
absorbed part of the impact of the disputed measures on the plants’ cash flows.
Professor Spiller argues that if one were to assess compensation to the Claimants
exclusively by focusing on the economic impact on the plants (i.e., without focusing on
damages to the Claimants), one would not be accounting for mitigation to those plant-
level damages that was achieved through the debt restructuring in the “actual” scenario.
In order to account for such mitigation, Professor Spiller computes the compensation
due to the Claimants as the sum of the impact of the disputed measures on their equity

and debt investments.”

Professor Spiller has calculated the economic impact of the disputed measures on the
plants at EUR 88,556,000 as of 1 June 2013 when including a cap on “but-for” IRRs
based on remuneration under RD 661/2007; and EUR 160,597,000 without this cap.
Professor Spiller maintains, however, that compensation should be computed in relation
to the Claimants’ equity and debt investments as, to do otherwise, the calculation of the
impact of the disputed measures on the plants would not account for damages mitigation
achieved through the reduction in the value of debt (through restructuring) in the

“actual” scenario, and hence would overstate damages to the Claimants.*”

Adopting Professor Spiller’s approach results in total damages to the Claimants’ equity

investments at EUR 37,057,000 as of 1 June 2013, and damages to the Claimants’ debt

investment at EUR 4,362,000 as of 1 June 2013. Thus, adopting this approach reduces
the compensation due to the Claimants from EUR 88,556,000 to EUR 41,419,000
assuming Professor Spiller’s approach to all the matters at issue in the Joint

Memorandum are accepted.*! Professor Spiller concludes:

The equity holders were thus able to mitigate the impact of the

measures by EUR 51.5 million, essentially by getting lenders to

absorb this portion of damages through the restructuring of the

portfolio companies’ financial debt. As Claimants also hold a

debt investment, they absorbed a part of the burden that was

shifted to lenders. In spite of suffering damages to its debt

holdings of EUR 4.4 million, Claimants’ net mitigation remains

significant, at EUR 47.1 million. In other words, this net

mitigation has to be deducted from the overall damages to the

plants to accurately reflect the actual losses suffered by the

Claimants as a result of the Measures. *?
The Tribunal agrees with Dr Flores that Professor Spiller’s calculation of debt is
entirely independent of the parameters in dispute in the Joint Memorandum and that,
whilst the compensation to equity depends on the PTRRR, the value of debt is
independent of that decision. Nevertheless, in order to mitigate the losses the Claimants
considered were caused as a result of the disputed measures, the Claimants did

restructure their debts, and significant mitigation was clearly achieved.

The concept of mitigation requires a claimant to take steps to minimise its loss and to
avoid taking unreasonable steps that increase its loss. An injured party cannot recover
damages for any loss (whether caused by a breach of treaty, contract or duty) which
could have been avoided by taking reasonable steps. The duty to mitigate damages is
recognised as a general principle of law and as the tribunal in Middle-East Cement

Shipping and Handling Co v Egypt stated:

. this duty can be considered to be part of the General
Principles of Law which, in turn, are part of the rules of
international law which are applicable in this dispute according
to Art. 42 of the ICSID Convention.*?

8! Which, of course, they are not. However, taking into account those areas where the Tribunal has accepted the
arguments of Dr Flores, it still results in a significant reduction in the compensation due to the Claimants.

It is clear from Professor Spiller’s calculations, which are not questioned by Dr Flores,
that the debt restructuring has mitigated the losses to the Claimants. Whether further
mitigation steps could have been taken is not clear to the Tribunal and, certainly, the
Respondent has not argued that other steps could have been taken. Equally, Dr Flores
has not sought to provide any calculations to show that greater mitigation could have

been achieved by restructuring the Claimants’ debt and equity in some other way.

In consequence, the Tribunal accepts that mitigation has been achieved by the
Claimants and, in the absence of any argument to the contrary, that mitigation is the

best that could reasonably have been achieved.

Dr Flores argues that the debt damages of EUR 4,362,000 ought not to be included in
the compensation to the Claimants because the debt is unrelated to any investment to
build or refurbish plants, ** because if the Claimants’ predecessors had characterised the
entire equity investment as debt in 2010 before they sold the Ondina portfolio to the
Claimants, then those cash flows would be insulated from any change in regulation,
regardless of whether such a change was determined to be a breach by the Tribunal,*>

and, finally, because:

Prof. Spiller calculates that Claimants would lend funds to their

own plants in some years (as debt, not as equity contributions).

Those amounts would be repaid later (to themselves), with

interest. This would have occurred whether or not the Measures

were implemented, as demonstrated by the fact that

Prof. Spiller’s but for cash flows are insufficient to “repay” this

debt. This shows that Prof. Spiller’s distinction between debt and

equity is artificial.*°
The Tribunal would consider all of these arguments as valid if the debt damages were
not related to the mitigation measures. Effectively, however, these debt damages of
EUR 4,362,000 represent the “costs” incurred by the Claimants in mitigating their loss
and reducing the overall losses from EUR 88,556,000 to EUR 41,419,000. It is well
established that, as part of the duty to mitigate, costs incurred in mitigating are
recoverable so long as they are reasonably incurred and do not exceed the result of the

mitigation itself. The debt damages appear to the Tribunal to have been reasonably

incurred, given the huge reduction achieved in the losses to the Claimants overall and,

clearly, do not come close to exceeding the result of that mitigation.

In consequence, the Tribunal does not consider the debt damages should be excluded
from the compensation due to the Claimants.

APPLICATION OF THE JOINT MODEL

The Joint Model is designed to calculate the compensation due to the Claimants once

the Tribunal has decided what the inputs to the Joint Model should be.

There are seven input boxes or “General Switches” as they are called in the Joint Model,

namely:

- The PTRRR;

- The value of the plants as of June 2013;

- The definition of individual plants;

- Whether PTRRR should be capped at the RD 661/2007 level;
- The discount rates;

- The inclusion, or otherwise, of the Alange plant; and

- Whether a further calculation is needed to account for the impact on the Claimants’

equity and debt investments in the portfolios.

Each of the General Switches gives binary choice, “CLEX” or “QE”, CLEX
representing Compass Lexecon (i.e., Professor Spiller’s arguments) and QE
representing Quadrant Economics (i.e., Dr Flores’ arguments). For the switch for the
value of the plants, if the CLEX option is chosen, there is the ability to choose whether

it should be book value or value implied by the Claimants’ investment in the plants.

As is apparent from the analysis of the Tribunal above the Tribunal has accepted
Professor Spiller’s arguments in respect of the value of the plants as of June 2013, the

definition of individual plants, whether PTRRR should be capped at the RD 661/2007

level, the discount rates and whether a further calculation is needed to account for the
impact on the Claimants’ equity and debt investments in the portfolios. The Tribunal
has accepted Dr Flores’ arguments as to the exclusion of the Alange plant and, although
it accepts Professor Spiller’s approach to the calculation of the PTRRR it adopts
Dr Flores’ figure of 7% as being the most likely to be correct, whilst disagreeing with

the method of calculation adopted by Dr Flores.

Accordingly, once those findings are inputted, the calculation of the compensation due

to the Claimants made by the Joint Model is EUR 30,875,000.

DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL ON QUANTUM

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal orders the Respondent to pay to the
Claimants the sum of EUR 30,875,000 in compensation for the losses incurred by the
Claimants by reason of the Respondent’s breach of ECT Article 10(1).

INTEREST

qd) The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants request an award of interest as “an integral component of full
compensation under international law.” They assert that it is not an addition to

reparation but a part of it by which damages are repaired in full.’

They rely on Article 38 of the ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for

Internationally Wrongful Acts, which provides:

1. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be
payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The
interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve
that result.

2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have
been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.

According to the Claimants, in order to allow for full compensation of the damages

caused by Spain’s wrongful measures, the cost of equity in Spain at the date of the

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 38 of 298

alleged expropriation, i.e. 8 July 2015, is the appropriate rate for pre-award interest.**
It comprises the market risk and the country risk premia and the systematic risk of the
company’s equity (the Beta), and represents — in the analysis of the Claimants’
quantum experts — “the minimum rate that a rational investor would have demanded to
willingly postpone collection of their dividends, which is what Claimants have been
forced to do since the introduction of the Measures”.*® The application of a risk-free
and short-term interest rate would under-compensate the Claimants since it fails to
reflect the fact that the measures reduced the operating companies’ profits and thus the

dividends that the Claimants would have been able to collect.”

128. The Claimants rely — among others — on Vivendi v Argentina, where the tribunal found
an interest rate based on the claimant’s cost of capital “a reasonable proxy for the return
the Claimants could otherwise have earned on the amounts invested and lost in the ...

concession”.°!

129. The Claimants base their calculation on the quantum experts’ finding as to the cost of
equity on 8 July 2015 of 6.46%. They argue that this rate should be applied to the
calculation of pre-award interest, running from the first wrongful measures on

1 January 2013 to the date of the final award.

130. With respect to post-award interest, the Claimants submit that its “function is to
eliminate a State’s incentive to delay full payment of the award”.°? They rely
on Gold Reserve v Venezuela, where the tribunal found that tribunals “may also
determine a different interest rate to apply to post-Award interest than that applied to
pre-Award interest. This is because the purpose of post-Award interest is arguably

different — damages become due as at the date of the Award, and from this time,

88 As an alternative, the Claimants present a rate of cost of equity established at a different valuation date, i.e. the
proxy date of an award. However, for the calculation of the interest rate, they rely on the rate at the date of
8 July 2015.

Respondent is essentially in default of payment.” They point to other awards that have

applied a higher rate for post-award than for pre-award interest.°*

131. On that basis, the Claimants seek interest from the day of the award until its full

payment at the cost of equity (6.46%) plus an additional 2%.°°

132. Further, the Claimants request that the combined pre-award and post-award

interest be compounded annually.*° They present “compounding as an element of full

997

reparation”’’ and rely on extended literature and awards in that sense, of which

“better reflects current business and economic realities and therefore the actual damage

suffered by a party”.°®

(2) The Respondent’s Position

133. The Respondent submits that, on the hypothesis that damages are awarded (a) the rate
for pre-award and post-award interest should be identical,’ and (b) “‘a ‘short-term risk-

free rate’ should be applied, such as the 6-month or 1-year EURIBOR, consistent with

economic doctrine and practice”.!

134. The Respondent does not engage in a discussion on the issue of compounding

the interest.

135. The Respondent argues, relying on the opinion expressed in the quantum expert

101

reports," that the Claimants’ approach based on the cost of equity prevailing at any

time after the measures is mistaken, because it builds on the erroneous assumption that

they were exposed to a country risk, a market risk and a risk of securities as from 2013,

which in reality would not exist for the funds potentially granted as compensation by

an award at a much later date.

136. It relies on Vestey v Venezuela, where the tribunal had awarded interest using the yield
of the 6-months U.S. Treasury Bills with a view to avoid “to reward it [the victim]
for risks which it does not bear.”!°? Similarly, in Gold Reserve v Venezuela the tribunal
had awarded pre-award interest in reference to the U.S. Treasury Bills rate and post-
award interest in reference to LIBOR.' The Respondent quotes Mark Kantor
who summarizes the arbitral practice by stating that “[a]s a practical matter, the interest
rate used for the historical amount is often a ‘risk-free’ rate (such as the rate for

US Treasuries) or a statutory rate for pre-judgment interest.” !°*

137. With respect to post-award interest, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ argument

that its rate should be higher in order to discourage delaying payment tactics.
138. Firstly, it agrees with Micula v Romania, where the tribunal did not

see why the cost of the deprivation of money (which interest
compensates) should be different before and after the Award, and
neither Party has convinced it otherwise. Both are awarded to
compensate a party for the deprivation of the use of its funds.
The Tribunal will thus award pre- and post-award interest at the
same rate, !°°

139. Secondly, it considers the increase of the rate by 2% as punitive, which is contrary to
Article 36 ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful
Acts. In this regard, the commentary of 2001 states that “[c]ompensation ... is not

concerned to punish the responsible State, nor does compensation have an expressive

or exemplary character.” !°°

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal considers the payment of interest as an integral component of full
reparation, running from the date of the occurrence of damage to the date of full
payment of the debtor’s obligations, as provided for in Article 38 ILC Draft Articles on

Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.

The Claimants assert that the valuation date for the accrual of damages is
1 January 2013. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum
the Tribunal has found that the relevant date for the calculation of an adequate PTRRR
is June 2013.'

In their Joint Memorandum of 22 May 2020, quantum experts Professor Spiller and
Dr Flores have based their calculations on that date, Professor Spiller explicitly
referring to 1 June 2013, and Dr Flores implicitly agreeing thereto. Since 1 June 2013
is the decisive date for the measurement of the PTRRR, the relevant date for the
potential damages, compensation of damages and interest to be paid must be identical.
Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the date at which the interest starts to run is

1 June 2013.

Although being part of reparation of damages, interest is not simply an additional
element in the overall calculation of compensation, which would increase the principal
sum and would duplicate calculation of damages. Therefore, it cannot be considered as
compensation for potential “additional profits”, determined by the cost of equity, as
suggested by Professor Spiller’s quantum expert opinion.'®* Rather, the payment of
interest compensates the injured person for the fact that for a certain period of time the
principal sum is not at its disposal, and that it is temporarily deprived of liquidity.
Interest does not compensate for the loss of money but for the loss of the use of money,

a “secondary element, subordinated to the principal amount of the claim”. !°?

This rationale does not allow to distinguish between a period of deprivation of liquidity
before the award and after the award. The duty to pay interest does not pursue a punitive

objective. It compensates for the temporary loss of the use of the principal sum due.

33

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 42 of 298

Therefore, the Tribunal agrees with the Micula v Romania and the RREEF v Spain
tribunals when they rejected the idea that “the cost of the deprivation of money (which
interest compensates) should be different before and after the Award”!!° and awarded

pre- and post-award interest at an identical rate.

145. As to the appropriate rate, the Tribunal believes it should reflect a commercial
borrowing rate which the Claimants would incur to compensate the deprivation
of liquidity by borrowing money. The Respondent and its quantum expert propose a “6-
month or 1-year EURIBOR, consistent with economic doctrine and practice”,!!!
corresponding to a short-term and risk-free rate. The Claimants object to the method

but do not question the figure. |!

146. EURIBOR is a commercial rate at which banks lend each other money. A margin must
be added to take into account that the Claimants do not have access to the inter-bank
rate. Given the circumstances of the case and the solidity of the Claimants’ investment,
the Tribunal considers a margin of 1% to be added to a one-year EURIBOR to be

appropriate.

147. The Claimants claim that the interest should be compounded annually. They argue that
the compounding of interest reflects economic practice and makes good missed
business opportunities. The Respondent does not argue to the contrary. The Tribunal

sees no reason to deny the Claimants’ request.

148. For these reasons, the Tribunal orders that the Respondent shall pay interest on the
principal sum outstanding under this Award (being EUR 30,875,000 at the date hereof)
from 1 June 2013 until the date of payment at the rate of one-year EURIBOR plus 1%,

established and compounded annually.

Under the fee arrangements ... Claimants are also liable to pay
to Three Crowns, and accordingly seek recovery of, success fees,
which consists of two components:

a A success fee that is payable by Claimants upon receipt
by them of a favourable final award for damages and
which is calculated by reference to the total amount of
damages awarded (contractually subject to a maximum of
EUR 1.5 million). Claimants request that the Tribunal first
render a further Decision on quantum to dispose of all
remaining claims other than costs, so as to allow Claimants
to present to the Tribunal a calculation of this success fee
component, which can then be addressed in the Tribunal’s
final award.

b_ A success fee balance that is payable by Claimants upon
actual collection of compensation in connection with their
claims and which is calculated by reference to the actually
collected amount (subject to a maximum of EUR 3,156,800).
As for this component, Claimants request the Tribunal
to grant a declaration that Spain shall be liable to pay any
such success fees to Claimants up to a maximum of
EUR 3,156,800 in the event of collection of the full amount
of damages being sought (i.e., EUR 98,199,000), and upon

In addition, the Claimants seek pre-award and post-award interest on the costs incurred
by them in connection with the arbitration. The Claimants submit that such interest
shall be “at the same rate as applied to the other components of the compensation which
they claim”, should run from the date such costs were incurred and be compounded

In its submissions on costs, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal exercise its
discretion to render an award of costs in the Respondent’s favour. It argues that “the
case involved a number of challenging procedural and legal issues, which the
Respondent addressed with professional and effective advocacy”, as it can be perceived

In addition, the Respondent submits that the Claimants’ request that success fees be
included in the Tribunal’s decision on costs is unfounded, and that the Claimants’
update in Compass Lexecon’s fees and expenses is excessive and abusive.!!*

Accordingly, the Respondent requests that:

(a) The Tribunal decides that the Kingdom of Spain should under
no circumstances be ordered to bear the Claimants’ costs

(b) And subsidiarily,

- the Tribunal excludes from Claimants’ Statement of Costs the
concepts alluded to as success fees.

- And, if an update of fees and expenses of Compass Lexecon is
granted, to reduce them to a more reasonable amount.!!?

(3) The Tribunal’s Decision on Costs

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except
as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by
the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide
how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the
members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the
facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form
part of the award.
This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration,

including attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

The Tribunal notes that, in the present case, both Parties have presented their case
efficiently, even though neither party has prevailed with respect to the entirety of their
claims. First, the Claimants had requested compensation in an amount of at least
EUR 132.1 million, while the Tribunal has set the amount of compensation awarded at
EUR 30,875,000. Second, as to jurisdiction, the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent’s

first jurisdictional objection (concerning EU law issues) and upheld the Respondent’s

48 Resp, Comm. Costs., 7.
49 Resp, Comm. Costs., § 21.

38

Case 1:21-cv-02463 Document 1-1 Filed 09/20/21 Page 47 of 298

second jurisdictional objection (regarding the taxation carve-out in Article 21 and the
MEN clause of Article 10(7) of the ECT). As to the merits, the Claimants have prevailed
partly on legitimate expectations as a breach of the fair and equitable treatment
obligation contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT. However, the Tribunal dismissed the
Claimants’ claims on expropriation under Article 13(1) of the ECT, as well as
the alleged violations of the duty to provide most constant protection and security, and
non-impairment by unreasonable or discriminatory measures under Article 10(1) of
the ECT.

159. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that it is fair to order that each Party should bear
its own legal costs and other expenses and that the Parties should share equally the costs

of the arbitration.

160. The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Lord Collins of Mapesbury USD 310,272.13

Professor Rolf Knieper USD 126,445.56
Mr Peter Rees QC USD 114,045.45
ICSID’s administrative fees USD 190,000.00

. USD 152,922.60
Direct expenses

Total USD 893,685.74

161. The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal
