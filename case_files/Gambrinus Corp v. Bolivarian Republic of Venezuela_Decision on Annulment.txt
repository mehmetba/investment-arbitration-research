INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATION

This case concerns an application for annulment (the “Application”) of the award rendered
on June 15, 2015 in ICSID Case No. ARB/11/31 (the “Award”) in the arbitration
proceeding between Gambrinus Corporation (“Gambrinus” or the “Applicant”) and the

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the “Respondent” or “Venezuela’).

The Applicant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

The Award decided on a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement between
the Government of Barbados and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the
Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated July 15, 1994, which entered
into force on October 31, 1995 (the “BIT” or “Treaty”), and the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated

March 18, 1965, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The dispute relates to the alleged expropriation by the Respondent of Gambrinus’ ten
percent (10%) equity interest in a group of four Venezuelan companies, jointly referred to
as “Fertinitro,” which produces nitrogen fertilizers (ammonia and urea) for export and
internal use in Venezuela, through the operation and maintenance of four petrochemical

plants.

In the Award, the Tribunal reached the conclusion that Gambrinus did not own an
investment in Venezuela at the time of the alleged BIT breaches and, therefore, declined

jurisdiction.

Gambrinus applied for the annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1)
subparagraphs (b), (d), and (e) of the ICSID Convention, identifying three grounds for
annulment: (i) manifest excess of powers; (ii) serious departure from a fundamental rule of

procedure; and (iii) failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On October 9, 2015, Gambrinus filed with the Secretary-General of ICSID the Application.

The Application was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule
50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (“Arbitration Rules”),
within 120 days after the date of the Award.

On October 16, 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties that the
Application had been registered on that date and that the Chairman of the Administrative
Council of ICSID would proceed to appoint an ad hoc committee pursuant to Article 52(3)
of the ICSID Convention.

By letter of January 15, 2016, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(2), the
Secretary-General notified the Parties that the ad hoc committee (the “Committee”) had
been constituted and that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that

date.

The Committee was composed of Tan Sri Dato’ Cecil W.M. Abraham, a national of
Malaysia, President; Ambassador Hussein A. Hassouna, a national of Egypt; and Doctor
Michael C. Pryles, a national of Australia. Ms. Sara Marzal Yetano, ICSID Legal Counsel,

was designated to serve as Secretary of the Committee.

The first session of the Committee was held by teleconference on March 10, 2016. In

addition to the Committee and its Secretary, participating in the conference were:

Committee on disputed issues.

On April 15, 2016, Gambrinus filed its Memorial in Support of its Application for

Annulment (“Memorial on Annulment”).

On September 2, 2016, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial to the Application for

Annulment (“Counter-Memorial on Annulment”).

On October 28, 2016, Gambrinus filed its Reply in Support of the Application for

Annulment (“Reply on Annulment”).

On December 23, 2016, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder to the Application for

Annulment (“Rejoinder on Annulment”).

On January 26, 2017, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 in which it ruled on

certain pending procedural matters related to the organization of the hearing on annulment.

A hearing on annulment was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. on February

THE AWARD

Below is a brief summary of the relevant sections of the Award, including a summary of

the facts that are relevant for the purpose of the present annulment proceedings.”

SUMMARY OF RELEVANT FACTS

During the 90’s Venezuela decided to increase its production of fertilizers.> During that
time, Venezuela through its State-owned entity, Petroquimica de Venezuela S.A.‘
(“Pequiven”), sought private partners to participate in the development of a fertilizer

production facility.°

As a result, on April 8, 1998, Pequiven, Polar Uno C.A., later named Inversiones Polar
S.A.° (hereinafter, “Polar”), a company incorporated in Venezuela, Koch Oil S.A. (later
denominated Koch Minerals S.a.r.1.) (“Koch”), a company incorporated in Switzerland,
and Snamprogetti B.V. (“Snamprogetti”), a company incorporated in the Netherlands,
concluded a Joint Investors’ Agreement (the “JIA”), setting forth the contractual
framework for the construction, operation and investment terms of two ammonia plants

(the “Project”).’

Pursuant to the JIA, the four joint investors (also referred as “Owners” under the JIA),
agreed to the creation of four Venezuelan companies, jointly referred to as “Fertinitro”:
Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente, S.A. (the “Company”); Fertilizantes Nitrogenados
de Oriente C.E.C. (the “Comandita’’); Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela S.R.L.; and
Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela, Fertinitro C.E.C. (the “Operating Company”).®

? This factual summary is based on the facts described in the Award and is not intended to be an exhaustive and
detailed narrative of all such facts. Rather, its purpose is simply to provide the general context of this Decision.

According to Section 2.1 of the JIA, the ownership structure of Fertinitro was as follows:
35% owned by Pequiven; 35% owned by Koch; 20% owned by Snamprogetti and 10%

owned by Polar.

Koch and Polar owned their respective interests in the Project through wholly owned
“Special Purpose Subsidiaries” (as defined in the JIA), namely Koch José Cayman Islands
Limited (“Koch José”), and Polar José Investments Limited, (“Polar José”) respectively,
both companies organized under the laws of Cayman Islands. In accordance with Section
2.4 of the JIA and its Recitals, Koch and Polar as Owners, remained responsible together
with the Special Purpose Subsidiaries for compliance with all the obligations under the
JIA. Moreover, the only assets of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries were the shares or debt
in the Fertinitro Companies. By February 18, 1998, Koch transferred 28.571% of its
interest in Koch José to Latin American Investment Fund (“LAIF”). LAIF then became a
10% shareholder of Fertinitro.°

Article VI of the JIA regulated the transfer of Fertinitro’s shares. Sections 6.1. and 6.2

provided as follows:

6.1. Restriction _on Transfer, No Owner shall give, sell, assign,
transfer, pledge, hypothecate, mortgage, grant a security interest in,
or otherwise dispose of and/or encumber any of its interests or any
interest therein (“Disposition”) other than a Disposition permitted
under Section 6.2 unless such Owner complies with the provisions
of this Article VI. Any Disposition attempted or made without full
compliance with this Article VI in its entirety shall be null, void
and of no force or effect.

6.2 Permitted Dispositions. The following Dispositions shall be
permitted without compliance with any other provision of this
Article VI other than Section 6.7:

6.2.1 by Pequiven to VIE as contemplated in Section 2.1.1;

6.2.2 by an Owner to an Affiliate of such Owner (including any
Special Purpose Subsidiary) if: (a) such Owner has provided at least
thirty (30) days written notice of such Disposition to the Company,

°Id., 440.

Comandita and each of the other Owners; [...] (d) the transferring
Owner agrees, pursuant to instruments in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the non-transferring Owners, to remain
responsible with the transferee Affiliate for compliance with all the
obligations of the transferring Owner under this Agreement,
including execution of a Parent Performance Agreement by any
Parent Company of the transferee, if applicable; and (e) the
transferee Affiliate becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant to
the instruments in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
non-transferring Owners. [...]

30. In accordance with Section 6.2 of the JIA, all “Permitted Dispositions” are subject to the

requirements set forth in Section 6.7, which provides as follows:

6.7. Additional Interest Transfer Requirements. Any Disposition of

On August 6, 2001, Polar decided to remove Polar José (the Special Purpose Subsidiary of
the Cayman Island) from the Fertinitro investment structure, and, instead, to own its shares
through Inversiones Polar S.A., the parent company. Polar José completed the transaction

without objection from the other shareholders. '!

On January 21, 2008, pursuant to Section 6.2.2 of the JIA and Section 12(b) of the articles
of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and the Comandita (the “Fertinitro By-
Laws”), Polar notified Pequiven, Koch, Snamprogetti, the Comandita and the Company,
of its intention to “transfer all the Polar Interests to Gambrinus Corporation.” In that same
letter, Polar specified that it “desired to consummate the transfer as soon as practicable,
and no later than 24 January 2008.” Polar then requested from the addressee’s shareholders
a “waiver” of the 30-day prior notice requirements contemplated in the JIA for transfers to

affiliates. '2

The January 21, 2008 notice was accompanied by an “Assumption Instrument” dated
January 22, 2008, to be signed by Polar and Gambrinus “before the consumption of the
Transfer, all in compliance with Sections 6.2.2 and 6.7 of the [JIA] and Section 12(b) of

[Fertinitro By-Laws].” Under the terms of the executed Assumption Instrument:

¢ Polar agreed to remain jointly and severally “responsible” with Gambrinus for

compliance with all the obligation of Polar under the JIA;

¢ Polar agreed to repurchase its interest in Fertinitro should Gambrinus cease to be an
affiliate of Polar; and

¢ Gambrinus agreed to become a part to the JIA, adopted the JIA and assumed all of the

obligations as if it were an original “named party thereto.” !?

On January 22 and 23, 2008, Pequiven, Koch, Snamprogetti, the Company and the

Comandita granted the requested waivers. ‘4

On January 24, 2008, Gambrinus and Polar executed a share purchase agreement (the
“Share Purchase Agreement” or the “2008 Transfer”). Pursuant to clause THREE of the
Share Purchase Agreement, Gambrinus would pay USD eighty million and one hundred
dollars (USD 80,000,100.00) for Polar’s 10% equity interest in Fertinitro “at a future date
following the granting of this document.” On that same date, Simon Guevara, the Secretary
of Fertinitro’s Board, sent an email to Tony Parra, Koch-appointed Director, stating that
the 2008 Transfer complied with the requirements under the purchase and financing

documents, including Section 6.2 of the JIA.!5

On February 15, 2008, Gambrinus and Polar subscribed a common share subscription
agreement (the “Common Share Subscription Agreement”). In accordance with the
terms of this agreement, Gambrinus issued 800,001 (eight hundred thousand and one)
common shares in itself to Polar for an amount of USD 80,000, 100.00. The Common Share
Subscription Agreement further stipulated that “as a result of the capitalization of the
Subscription Amount by [Polar] in [Gambrinus], the account receivable that [Polar] has
against [Gambrinus] is hereby extinguished.” No cash was exchanged between Gambrinus

and Polar for this transaction.

On October 11, 2010, Venezuela enacted Decree No. 7,713, which provided the forced

acquisition of Fertinitro (the “Expropriation Decree”).!”

On November 8, 2011, Gambrinus filed before ICSID its Request for Arbitration against

Venezuela. !®

THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS

In Section V of the Award, the Tribunal addressed the jurisdictional objections raised by
Respondent. Venezuela objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal ratione personae,
ratione temporis and ratione materiae, under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the
BIT alleging, inter alia, that (A) Gambrinus is not a protected foreign investor and Polar’s
use of Gambrinus’ legal personality is an abuse of corporate personality; (B) the dispute
pre-dates the “interposition” of Gambrinus in the corporate structure and/or was reasonably
foreseeable at that time; and (C) Gambrinus made no investment, as it has not proved title
to the Fertinitro shares and its purported interest is not an “investment” for purposes of the
ICSID Convention and the BIT.

In Section V.B. and V.C of the Award, the Tribunal analyzed and rejected the objections
ratione personae and ratione temporis (A and B above), and in Section 5.D of the Award,
the Tribunal addressed Respondent’s ratione materiae objection, which is the sole object
of the present annulment proceedings. A brief summary of the Parties’ relevant arguments

on the ratione materiae objection follows.

According to the Respondent, the detailed restrictions of the JIA regarding share transfers
were the result of careful drafting and analysis given the importance of the Owners and
their identity, each of whom had been carefully selected to participate in the Project. Any
attempted transfer in violation of the restrictions of Section 6 would be null, void and
legally ineffective. These restrictions equally applied to a transfer of shares to an affiliate.
Although a “Permitted Disposition” under Section 6.2, a transfer to an affiliate would also
be subject in any case to satisfaction of each of the conditions of Section 6.7, including the
requirement that “any Disposition shall be made exclusively for cash or cash equivalents
to the exclusion of any other considerations.” According to the Respondent, this condition
would have assisted in ensuring, among other things, the solvency and economic standing
of the transferee, the transparency as to the value of the disposition and the genuine

character of the operation.'?

” Id.,4250.

46,

In addition, the Respondent pointed out that Articles 11 and 15 of the Fertinitro By-Laws
contain a mirror validity requirement that all transfers be made “in cash or cash equivalent
to the exclusion of any other forms of consideration,” and that any non-compliant

disposition of interests would be null and void.”°

The Respondent further argued that Gambrinus did not make a payment in “cash or cash
equivalent.” Instead, Polar and Gambrinus devised a “share for share transaction.”*! Under
the Common Share Subscription Agreement, the amount owed by Polar for the subscription
of the newly issued Gambrinus shares was set-off against the identical sum that Gambrinus
owed to Polar under the Share Purchase Agreement. The Respondent argued that, under
this arrangement, no funds were transferred from Gambrinus to Polar and that the issuance
of the new shares could not be considered as payment in cash or having been made through

a “cash equivalent.”2

On this basis, the Respondent argued that the 2008 Transfer was, in accordance with
Section 6(1) of the JIA, null and void ab initio, which pursuant to Venezuelan law, has the
same effect as non-existence. Accordingly, the 2008 Transfer never materialized,
Gambrinus never acquired ownership of the shares in Fertinitro and it never became an

owner under the terms of the JIA.”?

Finally, the Respondent claimed that the 2008 Transfer was made in breach of the general
principle under Venezuelan law of good faith, so that even if Gambrinus had actually
acquired the ownership of Fertinitro shares, Gambrinus would nevertheless not be entitled

to claim the BIT protection.”4 75

24 1d, 4270.

25 As part of its jurisdictional objection ratione materiae, Respondent also argued that, even if the Tribunal found that
the 2008 Transfer was valid, Gambrinus would still not own a protected investment under the terms of the ICSID
Convention and the BIT. Yet, having reached the conclusion that Gambrinus did not own the Fertinitro shares at the
time of the alleged breach of the BIT, the Tribunal decided that it would not address Respondent’s second argument.

Si.

In response, Gambrinus contended that there is no basis, either in the JIA or the Fertinitro
By-Laws for challenging the 2008 Transfer. The 2008 Transfer was made in good faith,
fully disclosed to all shareholders and accompanied by cash/cash equivalent consideration
—namely, the obligation assumed by Gambrinus at the time of the transfer to pay Polar the
sum of USD 80,000,100. 76

Applicant argued that the “set-off” of two matching cash equivalent obligations satisfies
the cash equivalency requirement under Section 6(7) of the JIA and that, in any case, the
cash equivalency transfer requirement of the JIA and the Fertinitro By-Laws did not apply

to inter-affiliate transfers.?”

Relying on the legal opinion of Mr. James Otis Rodner (the “Rodner Opinion”),
Gambrinus argued that the requirement that the transfer be for cash or cash equivalent was
to facilitate the “right of first refusal.” However, since no right of first refusal arises with
respect to inter-affiliate transfers, there is no reason why the cash equivalency requirement

should be applicable in such cases.”

According to the Rodner Opinion, to apply the cash equivalency requirement to any
transfers between affiliates would lead to the absurd result of disallowing various
“Permitted Dispositions” under Section 6.2, specifically inter-affiliate transfers pursuant to
liquidation or merger under Section 6.2.2 or a share-for-share transfer under Section 6.2.1
since these Dispositions cannot be made “exclusively” for “cash equivalent consideration”

as expressed by Section 6.7(i).””

Gambrinus further contended that the Fertinitro By-Laws, far from being identical to the
JIA as asserted by Respondent, actually state that inter-affiliate transfers may be made
without complying with the “cash equivalent” requirement.*° According to the Rodner

Opinion, under the Fertinitro By-Laws, the cash equivalent requirement under Article 14

for a shareholder’s sale of its shares, applies with the express exclusion of the transactions

mentioned in Article 12 regarding inter-affiliate transfers, such as the 2008 Transfer.*!

Also on the basis of the Rodner Opinion, Gambrinus argued that contracts in Venezuela,
as in many civil law countries, are interpreted taking into account the real intentions of the
parties, avoiding absurd results and looking at the contract as a whole, meaning that one
must not read individual provisions without relating them to the parties’ intention when

entering into the contract and to the remaining clauses in the contract.”

The Rodner Opinion added that in civil law, including Venezuelan law, when the same
parties enter into several contracts that deal with the same subject, if there is contradiction
in the terms used in these contracts, the language of the later contract prevails over the
language of the earlier contract. In accordance with this principle, Gambrinus argued that

the terms of the Fertinitro By-Laws prevail over the terms of the JIA.

Furthermore, Gambrinus contended that the Respondent cannot dispute Gambrinus’ titles
to the shares since, regardless of whether cash equivalence was satisfied, failure to satisfy
this requirement: (i) does not, under Venezuelan law, lead to absolute nullity, and (ii)
cannot divest the Tribunal of jurisdiction under the Treaty since “no fundamental principle

of morality,” “public policy” or “illegality” is implicated here.*4

In reply to Gambrinus’ argument that the real intention of the parties was not to apply the
cash equivalency requirement to inter-affiliate transfers, the Respondent pointed out, inter
alia, that Section 6.7 of the JIA does not deal with pre-emption rights and therefore
situations of pre-emption cannot have been the reason for including the cash or cash
equivalent requirement.*> The Respondent further argued that, had the parties wished to

exclude inter-affiliate transfers from the cash or cash equivalent requirement, they could

3! Zd., § 254. Gambrinus also pointed out that neither the JIA nor the Fertinitro By-Laws require that the price set out
for an inter-affiliate transfer be disclosed, nor is there a requirement to disclose the kind or extent of the payment, in
contrast to third-party transfers under Section 6.4 of the JIA. See Id., 4] 236.

easily have done so, as tribunals are not supposed to rewrite the parties’ agreement by
resorting to rules of interpretation that are applicable in case of obscurity, ambiguities or

deficiencies in the parties’ intention, which is not the present case.*°

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS ON THE RATIONE MATERIAE OBJECTION

As mentioned above, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent’s objections ratione personae
and ratione temporis, but upheld the Respondent’s ratione materiae objection, which is the
sole object of the present annulment proceedings. Thus, the following summary of the

Tribunal’s analysis will exclusively deal with the ratione materiae objection.

The Tribunal analyzed Article VI of the JIA and noted that the terms of Section 6.2 of the
JIA make any disposition of shares, including transfers to affiliates, subject to the condition

of “cash or cash equivalents” consideration under Section 6.7(i).

The Tribunal also found that, pursuant to Section 2.1 of the JIA, to the extent that the terms

of the Fertinitro By-Laws conflict with the terms of the JIA, the terms of the latter prevail.>”

Moreover, the Tribunal analyzed the Fertinitro By-Laws and noted that, in accordance with
the last part of Article 14 of the Fertinitro By-Laws, any disposal or transfer of shares must
comply with the provisions contained in the JIA. Thus, the Tribunal concluded that also
under the Fertinitro By-Laws, transfers of shares to affiliates are subject for their validity
to the condition of payment being made in cash or cash equivalent, as provided by Section
6(7)(i) of the JIA.

The Tribunal further noted that both Parties and their legal experts had made reference to

Article 12 of the Venezuelan Code of Civil Procedure, according to which:**

En la interpretacion de contratos o actos que presenten oscuridad,
ambigiiedad o deficiencia, los jueces se atendran al proposito y ala
intencidn de las partes o de los otorgantes, teniendo en mira las
exigencias de la Ley, de la verdad y de la buena fe.

7 1d.,9§ 261.
38 1d., 4265.

61.

62.

63.

64.

65.

The Tribunal found that this provision means that under Venezuelan law the intention of
the parties will only take precedence over the contract language when there is “obscurity,
ambiguity or deficiency.”*? In this regard, the Tribunal also held that there is no “obscurity,
ambiguity or deficiency” in the provisions of the JIA regulating the transfer of shares,
including with regard to the condition under Section 6.7(i) that any transfer, including

transfers to affiliates, such as the 2008 Transfer, “be made for cash or cash equivalents.”"°

On this basis, the Tribunal concluded that it was not supposed to “modify” or “rewrite” the
JIA “merely because one might believe that requiring the application of this condition also

in case of inter-affiliate transfers would serve no useful purpose,”*!

or “only because it is
reasonable to think that the real purpose of that condition is to permit the exercise of the

right of first refusal of the other shareholders.”4?

The Tribunal was comforted in its conclusion by the statement of Polar in its letter of
January 21, 2008 to the other Owners stating that the 2008 Transfer would take place “in
compliance with Sections 6.2.2 and 6.7 of the [JIA] and Section 12(b) of the [Fertinitro
By-Laws].”4?

Further, the Tribunal agreed with Respondent that the Common Share Subscription
Agreement established a share-for-share payment and that such payment for the Fertinitro
shares did not comply with the cash equivalency requirement under Section 6.7 of the JIA,
since the Gambrinus shares are not “an immediately realizable liquid asset,’ Gambrinus

not being traded publicly.“

The Tribunal determined that the cash equivalency requirement under Section 6.7(i) of the

JIA was considered by the parties to the JIA to be an essential element of the contract,

* 1d., 266.

1 1d., 4266.

® Jd. 267. In this same paragraph, the Tribunal adds that, “[bly the same token, {it] should not rewrite the parties’
agreement because otherwise the condition of a ‘cash or cash equivalent’ consideration under Section 6.7(i) would
not permit implementing some of the Permitted Dispositions under Section 6.2 of the JIA.”

given the seriousness of the sanction that had been agreed in case of breach of such

condition — the “nullity” and the “no force of effect” of the purported transfer.*°

66. On this basis, the Tribunal determined that the 2008 Transfer may not be given effect in
the present case.*° Accordingly, the Tribunal concluded that Gambrinus owned no
investment at the time of the alleged expropriation of Fertinitro, due to the Share Purchase
Agreement being of no force and effect. “Having made no investment which may fall

within the BIT protection, [Gambrinus’] claim is not subject to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

which, accordingly, must be declined.’”47

4 Id. 272.

46 Jd. 273. According to paragraph 274 of the Award, this conclusion dispenses the Tribunal from dealing with
Respondent’s subordinate claim whereby, since the investment was not made in good faith, it should in any case be
denied protection. Yet, the Tribunal adds that, “[f]or what may be of relevance in the present case, the Tribunal is of
the view that [Gambrinus] did not act in breach of the [sic] good faith, its conduct being rather motivated by an
erroneous interpretation of the relevant provisions of the JIA and the By-Laws.”

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

THE APPLICANT’S POSITION

As mentioned above, Gambrinus seeks annulment of the Award on three of the five
grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention: (i) that the Tribunal manifestly
exceeded its powers; (ii) that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of

procedure; and (iii) that the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based.
Below is a summary of Gambrinus’ arguments:

(1) The Relevant Standards of Review

Citing the annulment decision in Sempra v. Argentina,* the Applicant argues that, when
interpreting the grounds for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, the
Committee should not apply neither a narrow nor a broad approach, nor a presumption in

favour of the Award’s validity.*°

With regards to the annulment ground based on a tribunal’s “manifest excess of powers”
(Article 52(1)(b)), the Applicant states that an excess of jurisdiction, or a failure to exercise

jurisdiction where it actually exists, is a “paradigm form of excess of powers.”°°

The Applicant contends that in order for the excess to be “manifest,” an error need not be
obvious on its face. Instead, in some cases, extensive argumentation and analysis may be

required.*!

The Applicant points out that a manifest excess of powers may also occur when a tribunal
fails to apply the relevant law, and argues that although a mere misinterpretation or

misapplication of the proper law will not suffice, a “gross or egregious error of law,

acknowledged as such by any reasonable person, could be construed to amount to a failure

to apply the proper law, and could give rise to the possibility of annulment.”*?

73. Moreover, the Applicant argues that when the ground for annulment is based on a
jurisdictional excess of power, the committee must apply a more rigorous approach and
undertake a “searching inquiry.” If a committee finds that the tribunal did not conduct a
“properly analysis” of a jurisdictional issue, such failure constitutes an annullable error.*
The Applicant supports this argument on the recent annulment decision in Venezuela
Holdings, in which the committee accepted that “there is some force in the argument
advanced by Venezuela [which in that annulment proceeding was the applicant] that
matters of jurisdiction may call for a more rigorous approach than other grounds for

annulment, simply because a tribunal ought not to be allowed to exercise a judicial power

it does not have (or vice versa).”*

74. As to the annulment ground based on the Tribunal’s “failure to state the reasons” (Article
52(1)(e)), the Applicant argues that an award will be annullable “as long as there is no
express rationale for the conclusions with respect to a pivotal or outcome-determinative
point.”5° In addition, the Applicant contends that, as established by the annulment

committee in MINE v. Guinea,*” an award will also be annullable when the Tribunal offers

“inconsistent reasons or frivolous reasons.”*®

jurisdiction, in the sense that it covers the case where a tribunal exercises a judicial power which on a proper analysis
had not been conferred on it (or vice versa declines to exercise a jurisdiction which it did possess).”

75. Citing the annulment decision in TECO v. Guatemala,” the Applicant argues that the
award must be annulled where “the Tribunal’s reasoning is not clear at all,” i.e., where “the
Committee, despite having the benefit of the Parties’ submissions and of the entire record
before it, has struggled to understand the Tribunal’s line of reasoning,” or where there is a
““complete absence of any discussion of the Parties’ [submissions] within the Tribunal’s
analysis of the’ overarching claim or defense.”

76. In particular, on the basis of the annulment decision in Venezuela Holdings, the Applicant
argues that a tribunal’s failure to address relevant principles of the applicable law
concerning existence and scope of property rights constitutes a failure to state the reason

under Article 52(1)(e) as well as a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b).°!

77. With regards to the annulment ground based on a serious departure from a fundamental
rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)), the Applicant highlights that the object and purpose
of this ground is to protect the integrity of the arbitral procedure, and that an award will
only be annullable on this basis when the relevant rule of procedure is “fundamental,” that

is, “when it ‘concerns a rule of natural justice’ i.e., is ‘concerned with the essential fairness

of the proceeding.

argument or claim. In addition, and on the basis of the annulment decisions in
Caratube,® and TECO,” the Applicant also contends that, the failure to properly apportion
the burden of proof between the parties may, in certain circumstances constitute a breach

of a fundamental rule of procedure.”!

Additionally, the Applicant contends that a departure from the fundamental rule of
procedure will be “serious” when it is “substantial” and “deprives a party of the benefit or
protection which the rule was intended to provide.””* In this regard, the Applicant further
argues that “[w]hen a procedural breach relates to a serious issue of contention between
the parties that is vital to the determination of the case, and concerns a break of a party’s

fundamental right, it is almost unqualifiedly ‘serious’”.”

Finally, the Applicant argues that in contrast with the other grounds for annulment, Article
§2(1)(d) encompasses “not only procedural breaches committed by the Tribunal, but also

those committed by other actors, such as the parties [...] or their counsel.”

(2) The Tribunal’s Manifest Excess of Powers and the Award’s Failure to State
the Reasons upon which it is based

Gambrinus argues that the Tribunal committed “annullable errors” that constitute a
manifest excess of power under Article 52(1)(b) and/or a failure to state the reasons under
Article 52(1)(e) in six (6) different ways: (i) in its treatment of the 2008 Transfer as being
void ab initio; (ii) in its application of the cash equivalency clause to inter-affiliate
transfers; (iii) in its conclusion on whether the 2008 Transfer involved cash/cash-
consideration; (iv) in its conclusion regarding the Common Share Subscription Agreement;
(v) in its failure to address and apply the 5-year prescription period and (vi) in its failure to

apply and address relevant international law.

a. The Tribunal’s treatment of the 2008 Transfer as being void ab initio

Gambrinus argues that, under Venezuelan law, a contractual transaction can only be
viewed as absolutely null and void if it fails to satisfy very basic conditions (e.g., if a
contract was signed by someone lacking basic capacity to consent) and a lawful end, and
if it violates an absolute norm of public policy.” According to the Applicant, this is
supported by the Rodner Opinion, which is in turn supported by fourteen exhibits and

references to Venezuelan law and legal authorities.”

In this sense, Gambrinus further argues that under Venezuelan law, the non-adherence to a
technical legal condition of transfer — a condition that was fully capable of being waived,
such as the cash equivalency requirement under Section 6.7 of the JIA — cannot make that
transfer null and void ab initio.” At the most, that transfer would only be potentially
capable of being invalidated at the suit of a contract counterparty having standing to seek
such relief (relative nullity), and until such a time that a competent court has declared that

transfer null, the transfer would remain valid and have full effect.”

Based on the above, the Applicant argues that the 2008 Transfer must be regarded as real
and extant from the moment of the Share Purchase Agreement and that the Tribunal
manifestly exceeded its powers by refusing to recognize Gambrinus’ investment on the
basis of Article VI of the JIA.”

The Applicant supports its position on the annulment decision in Occidental v. Ecuador,*®

which, according to Gambrinus, “bears striking parallels to the present case.”*! For the

5 Id., 4165.

7 Id.,4 165.

by Mr. Rodner, that a transaction cannot be regarded as ‘inexistent’ based upon the contractual condition that was
capable of being waived, particularly where that [sic] the shareholders had confirmed the shareholding.” Reply on

from a competent tribunal, the Applicant cites the expert opinion of Prof. Iribarren in another ICSID arbitration,
Crystallex Int’l Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, April 4, 2016
[“Crystallex”] (AL-018). In such case Prof. Iribarren acted as legal expert for Venezuela.

Applicant, the Occidental v. Ecuador annulment decision shows that in a civil law system
like Venezuela or Ecuador, the violation of a transfer restriction — such as the cash
equivalency requirement in this case — does not result in nullity ab initio, even if the
restriction declares non-conforming transfers to be null. Instead, in such circumstances, a
tribunal must treat the transfer as valid and to do otherwise would constitute a manifest

excess of jurisdiction.*

Additionally, the Applicant argues that a corollary error committed by the Tribunal in this
case (and as further illustrated by Occidental y, Ecuador) was that it assumed, without
proper foundation, that it actually possessed jurisdiction to declare the investment non-
existent, while in fact only a properly constituted tribunal, having jurisdiction under the

JIA and Fertinitro By-Laws, had such power.®

Finally, the Applicant claims that the Tribunal’s excess of powers was “manifest” since
applicable Venezuelan law had been articulated in the record and it was undisputed that
the JIA was subject to Venezuelan law, including the distinction between relative and
absolute nullity.*4 In response to Respondent’s contention that the issue of absolute versus

relative nullity was never raised before the Tribunal, the Applicant notes that the argument

82 7d., 4175. See also Reply on Annulment, {{ 36 to 44. The Applicant maintains that on this point Ecuadorian law
and Venezuelan law are in full harmony (Reply on Annulment, 42):

(a) Both Ecuadorian and Venezuelan law have different classes of “nullity,” namely,
inexistence, absolute nullity and relative nullity; these are separately delineated.

(b) Thus, under both Ecuadorian and Venezuelan law, a failure to meet certain
fundamental conditions for the existence of a contract leads to inexistence, and a failure to
satisfy certain conditions as demanded by fundamental public policy leads to absolute
nullity.

(c) Under both Ecuadorian and Venezuelan law, when an alleged pre-condition to a
contract or legal act is capable of being waived by the party in whose interest it is made,
and/or ratified, then the contract or legal act is only subject to “relative nullity” — i.e., it is
operative, and it is not null and void until and unless a party with standing obtains a
declaration of nullity from a competent tribunal.

83 Memorial on Annulment, § 176. The Applicant argues that the Occidental (AL-022) annulment decision
“underscores that an excess of powers occurs, and that excess is manifest, when an ICSID tribunal declares as
inexistent or null an event that was not inexistent or null (and which could only have been declared so by a different
tribunal) especially when such a declaration is contrary to the position taken by the parties who would have had
standing. It bears emphasis that a lawsuit seeking such a declaration would be a matter for Fertinitro’s shareholders
and creditors - who consented to and benefited from Gambrinus’ role as a shareholder — to litigate.” Reply on

was squarely raised in (i) its July 21, 2014 submission (the “July 2014 Submission”);**

(ii) Rodner’s Opinion of the same date,*® “

‘which formed an integral part of Gambrinus’
submissions;”*’ and Gambrinus’ September 26, 2014 post-hearing reply (the “2014 Post-
Hearing Reply”).**
b. The Tribunal’s application of the cash equivalency clause to inter-affiliate
transfers
The Applicant argues that the Tribunal acknowledged that the text of Article VI of the JIA
contained obscurities, ambiguities, or deficiencies that would lead to illogical results never

contemplated by the parties to the JIA.*

For instance, according to the Applicant, the Tribunal agreed with Gambrinus that the
application of the cash equivalency requirement in Section 6.7(i) to the “Permitted
Disposition” in Section 6.2 would render most of those dispositions literally impossible.”
The Tribunal also “explicitly” found that the cash equivalency requirement served no
purpose for inter-affiliate or other “Permitted Dispositions” under the JIA.°! Additionally,
the Tribunal acknowledged that “the cash equivalency provisions in the [Fertinitro] By-

Laws did not so clearly apply to inter-affiliate transfers.”

The Applicant argues that, faced with such obscurities, ambiguities or deficiencies,
Venezuelan law mandated that the Tribunal give effect to the actual intent of the parties in
the JIA — which would have led to the conclusion that the cash equivalency requirement

did not apply to inter-affiliate transfers — and that the Tribunal failed to do so.

For the Applicant, this omission is particularly telling given: (i) “the evidence that
Fertinitro’s Corporate Secretary and the Company’s lawyers, David Polk & Wardwell
(who drafted the JIA), knew about the inter-affiliate transfer [...] and yet made no inquiry
whatsoever concerning the ‘consideration’ being paid for the transfer;” and (ii) the
shareholders’ post-acquisition conduct, which “not only accepted Gambrinus as a

shareholder but relied on Gambrinus’ contractual obligations.”

In view of this omission, the Applicant concludes that the Tribunal committed two
annullable errors: first, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, and second, the Award

failed to state the reasons upon which it is based.°>

ce. The Tribunal’s conclusion on whether the 2008 Transfer involved
cash/cash-consideration
The Applicant argues that, even assuming that the Tribunal was correct in applying the
cash equivalency requirement to inter-affiliate transfers, its analysis of whether the 2008

Transfer actually met such requirement incurred an “annullable error.”

In particular, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal’s conclusion that the cash
equivalency requirement was not met because Gambrinus’ shares were not “an
immediately realizable liquid asset” was based only on the International Accounting
Standard 7 (“IAS 7”) which was introduced into the record by the Respondent without

seeking prior permission in breach of the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 2.°°

Instead, the Tribunal should have based its analysis on Venezuelan law under which —
according to the Rodner’s Opinion — a set-off of monetary obligations would comply with

the cash equivalency requirement provided under Section 6.7(i) of the JIA.

°* Memorial on Annulment, {| 187. In this sense, the Applicant also claims that the Award failed to consider, for
example, that the post-acquisition conduct of the shareholders, by application of the doctrine of good faith, also
provided a separate basis for finding that the cash equivalency requirement did not apply to the 2008 Transfer.

According to the Applicant, by relying only on the IAS 7 and failing to apply Venezuelan

law of set-off to the transaction, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.””

Furthermore, citing the annulment decision in TECO v. Guatemala,®* the Applicant argues
that by failing to explain why the law of set-off could not apply or why Mr. Rodner’s
analysis could not be accepted, the Award failed to state the reasons upon which it is

based.?

d. The Tribunal’s conclusion regarding the Common Share Subscription
Agreement
The Applicant argues that the Tribunal’s holding that the Common Share Subscription
Agreement had the effect of “converting” the transaction “into a share-for-share payment”

represents a further annullable error.!°°

The Applicant contends that, while the Tribunal applied a strict literalist approach to the
JIA, it applied a non-textual approach when it construed the Common Share Subscription
Agreement “as ‘converting’ the terms of the January 2008 Share Purchase Agreement into

an agreement to engage in a share-for-share transaction.”!°!

According to the Applicant, if a strict textual reading of the Share Transfer Agreement and
the Common Share Subscription Agreement had also been taken, this same approach would
inevitably have led to the conclusion that the cash equivalency requirement was satisfied,
since the Share Purchase Agreement created a money obligation payable in cash which was
discharged when Polar assumed a matching and offsetting cash payment obligation to

Gambrinus by virtue of the share subscription.

The Award’s failure to reconcile these different approaches leads to an unexplained

inconsistency in its treatment of the cash equivalency requirement which represents a

failure to state the reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, as well as a

manifest excess of powers of the Tribunal under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

e. The Tribunal’s failure to address and apply the 5-year prescription period

102. The Applicant argues that the Award never addressed the effect of the 5-year prescription
period for declaring nullity in Venezuelan law, which the Respondent’s own legal expert
acknowledged would have been applicable to any action for annulment of the 2008
Transfer.'©> For the Applicant, the Tribunal’s failure “to address the prescription period
and to apply its finding of good faith to the prescription period under Venezuelan law,”
represents a failure to give reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention as well

as a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, !“

103. In response to the Respondent’s contention that the 5-year prescription period was never
raised by Gambrinus before the Tribunal, the Applicant notes that the issue was raised (i)

in footnote no. 57 of its July 2014 Submission in response to the Respondent’s legal expert,

105 106107

Dr. Garcia Montoya,'”° and (ii) in the Rodner Opinion.

104. Moreover, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal also failed to consider the impact of the
5-year prescription period established in the Fertinitro By-Laws themselves and that this
failure also constitutes both a failure to give reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID
Convention, as well as a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID

Convention. !°8

Applicant contends that both Mr. Rodner and Dr. Garcia Montoya agreed that Venezuelan law establishes a distinction
between relative versus absolute nullity. Furthermore, the Applicant argues that the legal authorities submitted by both
legal experts on this issue are all in accord. See Reply on Annulment, §{] 75 and 76.

Sf The Tribunal’s failure to apply and address relevant international law

105. According to the Applicant, the Tribunal failed to address the argument made by
Gambrinus during the arbitration proceedings that international legal principles clearly
hold that jurisdiction should not be denied on the basis of a minor, non-prejudicial
noncompliance with contractual or regulatory provisions, such as the cash equivalency
requirement set forth in Section 6.7(i) of the JIA.'° In support of this argument, the
Applicant cited Rumeli Telekom A.S. v. Kazakhstan,''° Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine,'"!
Desert Line Projects LLC y. Yemen,''? and Metalpar S.A. v. Argentina."

106. The Applicant contends that this /acuna of the Award is “particularly troubling, given the
finding by the Tribunal that Gambrinus had acted in good faith in acquiring Fertinitro

shares in January 2008 and had not engaged in misrepresentation or bad faith conduct at

any time.”!4

107. The Applicant further argues that the Tribunal’s failure to apply the said international legal
principles constitutes a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID
Convention and that the absence of any discussion of this issue in the Award constitutes a

failure to give reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. !!*

legal consequences that under Venezuelan and international law emerged from the fact that all of the other
shareholders consented to and benefited from the 2008 Transfer. For the Applicant, these facts “compelled the
conclusion that, by application of good faith (actos propios), Venezuela was precluded from denying Gambrinus’
status as shareholder.” Reply on Annulment, § 83.

(3) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure

108. The Applicant also requests that the Award be annulled on the ground that there was a
serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID

Convention).

109. The Applicant argues that the Respondent was allowed to raise an allegedly entirely new
defense (the issue of whether or not the 2008 Transfer complied with the JIA’s cash
equivalency requirement, hereinafter the “JIA Defense”) during the first day of the hearing
on jurisdiction and the merits (the “Arbitration Hearing”), that is, after the closure of the

written phase of the proceedings, and in violation of the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No.
1 116

110. The Applicant argues that the timing of the Respondent’s JIA Defense “was not

accidental,” but a “deliberate ambush” “timed to obtain maximum surprise” and “strategic

LIT

advantage, that ultimately resulted in “a fundamentally imbalanced oral procedure, in

which [Gambrinus] was not able to prepare to argue the one point that was to prove

dispositive.”''® Furthermore, according to the Applicant, although the Tribunal’s

Procedural Order No. 2 attempted to give Gambrinus an opportunity to argue the issue, “it

is all too clear that these procedures were fundamentally inadequate.” !!?

111. For the Applicant, the untimely introduction of this new jurisdictional objection deprived

Gambrinus of its right to participate effectively in the oral phase of the Arbitration Hearing.

416 Memorial on Annulment, §j 112. In particular, the Applicant refers to Sections 13.9 and 13.10 of the Tribunal’s
Procedural Order No. 1 of 23 July 2012, according to which: “13.9. The Parties have agreed to include with their
written submissions (i.e., memorials, counter-memorials, replies and rejoinders) not only their legal arguments, but
also all the evidence on which they rely for the legal and factual positions advanced therein, including written witness
testimony, any expert testimony, documents and all other evidence in whatever form [...]13.10. Replies and rejoinders
shall respond strictly to the prior submission filed by the other Party and shall not raise new issues. The Parties shall
not be permitted to supplement their written submissions without authorization of the Tribunal.” The Applicant notes
that the Tribunal itself held, in its Procedural Order No. 2, that Respondent’s JIA Defense was a new argument not
allowed under Section 13.9 of Procedural Order No. 1. Reply on Annulment, § 20.

"8 7d., 4212. In response to the Respondent’s claim that it only became aware of the facts about the transfer when it
reviewed Gambrinus’ Rejoinder on Jurisdiction in January 2014, the Applicant contends that Gambrinus had disclosed
full copies of the January 2008 Share Purchase Agreement and the February 2008 Share Subscription Agreement by
the time it filed its Reply on August 30, 2013, that is, 7 months prior to the hearing. Reply on Annulment, {| 25.

In particular, the Applicant contends that the Respondent’s “ambush tactics” created the

following fundamental imbalances during the oral procedure:

An imbalance in the opening: Gambrinus’ counsel presented opening submissions
based solely upon the case as pleaded in written submissions while Respondent’s

counsel unveiled its new defense. 7°

An imbalance in testimony on Day 2: Gambrinus’ witness, Mr. Gabaldon, was cross-
examined on the JIA Defense on Day 2 of the Arbitration Hearing, while Gambrinus’

counsel was not in a position to adduce testimony from him on the issue.!7!

Further testimonial imbalances: Gambrinus’ decision not to call Mr. Haberman and Dr.
Garcia Montoya “was predicated, inter alia, on the jurisdictional and merits arguments
as then pled by Respondent” and therefore Gambrinus did not cross-examine them on

the opinions they had and would render with respect to the JIA Defense. '2?

An imbalance in the closing arguments: “Gambrinus’ counsel had not had the
opportunity to research and marshal their arguments on the JIA/cash equivalency

point 99123

112. The Applicant contends that all of these imbalances led to an impairment of the decision

making process that was not redressed or cured by the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 2,

which attempted to give Gambrinus an opportunity to address the JIA Defense, “albeit with

constraints of a page-limited brief and single expert opinion.”!4 In this regard, the

Applicant argues that the “damage” to the decision making-process is manifested in the

fact that Gambrinus’ post-hearing submissions on the JIA Defense did not receive “the

same level of attention as Respondent’s oral submissions and slide presentations”!?° and

in the fact that numerous arguments contained in its post-hearing submissions “were not

99126

subject of substantive deliberations”! or were simply ignored.'27

On this basis, the Applicant concludes that the imbalances led to a manifest and serious
violation of Gambrinus’ fundamental right to procedural equality and right to be heard, 78
and that the Tribunal’s failure to address numerous potentially dispositive points of law
and fact (particularly those identified in the Rodner Opinion), constituted a failure to
properly apportion the burden of proof which also constitutes a serious departure from a

fundamental rule of procedure. !29

Finally, in response to the Respondent’s argument that Gambrinus agreed to the procedures
set forth by the Tribunal to address the JIA Defense and therefore waived its right to
challenge the Award on this basis, the Applicant contends that Gambrinus “consistently
opposed the admission of the new defense.” !*° For the Applicant, the fact that Gambrinus
agreed to the timetable for the post-hearing briefs, after its objections to the admissibility
of the JIA Defense had been overruled, cannot be considered a waiver of the original

objection. '3!

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent contends that Gambrinus is attempting to use the annulment mechanism
as an appeal procedure against the Award'*? and requests that the Committee dismiss

Gambrinus’ Application in its entirety.

(1) Relevant Standards of Review

117. The Respondent highlights that the annulment remedy under the ICSID Convention is not
an appeal. It is an “exceptional” or extraordinary remedy for “unusual and important”
cases, which does not allow to review an award on the merits, but only under the five
limited grounds listed in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.'*? In support of this, the
Respondent cites Prof. Sct 134 and the 1 decisions in MINE v. Guinea,'*>

TECO v. Guatemala'*° and RSM vy. Grenada,'*"

 

118. For the Respondent, the exceptional or restricted nature of the annulment remedy explains
why, since the establishment of ICSID, only a very limited number of cases have resulted

ina full or partial annulment of an award.!*8

139

119. Citing the annulment decisions in El Paso v. Argentina!’ and Sempra y. Argentina,'* the

Respondent notes that the annulment ground based on a “manifest excess of power”
(Article 52(1)(b)) requires that the excess be “obvious, evident, clear, self-evident and
extremely serious,” as well as “quite evident without the need to engage in an elaborate
analysis of the text of the Award.”'4! Furthermore, contrary to what is suggested by the
Applicant, the Respondent argues that this requirement is applicable irrespective of
whether the tribunal’s decision is on the merits or on jurisdiction and cites, among others,

the annulment decision in Total v. Argentina.'”

120. In addition, in relation to the failure to apply the relevant law, the Respondent contends
that misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law, even if serious, does not justify
annulment.'? Furthermore, according to the Respondent, the distinction between failure to
apply the proper law and a misapplication or misinterpretation of the law is well-
established and has been recognized by a clear line of ad hoc committee decisions.'*
Relying on Continental Casualty v. Argentina,'* the Respondent adds that it is for the
Tribunal, not the ad hoc Committee, to determine the relevant provisions of the applicable
law, their content, their relevance and their legal effect and a tribunal’s decision on such

issues cannot amount to a manifest excess of power.'*°

121. As for the annulment ground based on the Tribunal’s failure to state the reasons upon which
the award is based (Article 52(1)(e)), the Respondent cites the annulment decision in MINE
y. Guinea!’ according to which, this ground does not apply “as long as the award enables
one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its

conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or law.”!® Citing Wena v. Egypt,'”° the

application of that law is beside the point.” In this regard, the Respondent highlights E7 Paso {| 144, in which the
Committee held: “[I]t is necessary to distinguish between the failure to apply the proper law and an error in the
application of that law. The first is a ground for annulment under Article 52, the second is not. Reviewing the
substantive reasoning by which an arbitral tribunal reached its conclusions would require reexamining how the
tribunal applied or interpreted the law, which would transform annulment committees into appellate tribunals. Under
this scenario, committees would necessarily have to evaluate the facts and the evidence as well as the legal principles
put forward by the parties all of which were already analyzed by the respective arbitration tribunal. This would change
the very nature of the ICSID arbitration system.”

Respondent further argues that this ground does not allow an ad hoc committee to
“reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal’s decisions were appropriate or

not, convincing or not.”!5°

‘5! and Wena v. Egypt,'* the Respondent also contends

Relying on TECO v. Guatemala
that insufficient reasoning, as opposed to a complete failure to state reasons, does not
warrant annulment, and that the obligation to state the reasons does not require that each
reason be stated expressly, but may be implicit in the Tribunal’s reasoning. '*? Moreover,
citing Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates,'*4 the Respondent argues that some ad hoc
committees have also suggested that they have discretion to further explain or clarify the

tribunal’s reasoning rather than annulling the award.'%5

The Respondent further stresses that, under Article 48 of the ICSID Convention, a tribunal
need not address and respond to each and every argument raised by the parties and that, in
fact, even a failure to deal with every question under ICSID Convention Article 48 is not a

ground for annulment under ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(e). 156

With regards to the annulment ground based on a serious departure from a fundamental
tule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)), the Respondent argues that the award should only be
annulled on this basis when the tribunal has departed from a fundamental rule of procedure,
since it is for the tribunal to ensure that such fundamental principles are respected

throughout the arbitration. !°7

The Respondent notes that ad hoc committees have only admitted this ground in “extreme”

cases given that, as explained by the Wena v. Egypt'** ad hoc committee, the “serious

departure” requirement means that the departure from the fundamental rule of procedure
“must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would

have awarded had such a rule been observed.”!°

Finally, the Respondent argues that when this annulment ground is based on an alleged
violation of a party’s right to be heard the “bar is set high.” In this regard, the Respondent
cites the recent annulment decision in Venezuela Holdings according to which “[i]n the
limited number of cases in which ad hoc committees have given serious consideration to
the contention that a party has been denied the right to be heard, it has been on the basis
that a tribunal reached its ultimate award on a ground that one or both parties had had no

opportunity to address at all in its argument.”!®!

(2) The Tribunal’s Manifest Excess of Powers and the Award’s Failure to State
the Reasons upon which it is based

The Respondent contends that Gambrinus’ allegations regarding the Award’s alleged

failure to state the reasons and the Tribunal’s manifest excess of powers constitute an

attempt to completely re-litigate its case on jurisdiction and to introduce new jurisdictional

arguments that had never been raised before the Tribunal, such as the lack of jurisdiction

over the question of the existence of the 2008 Transfer. '%

According to the Respondent, the Award unambiguously sets out the reasons which led the
Tribunal to conclude that it lacked jurisdiction. !© Furthermore, the Tribunal decided well
within the scope of its powers when it declined jurisdiction over Gambrinus’ claims,

applying the proper law to the issue of the ownership over the alleged investment. '

Holdings (AL-066), that a tribunal’s failure to address relevant principles of the applicable law concerning existence
and scope of property rights constitutes an annullable error (see | 76 above), the Respondent contends that, unlike in

Venezuela Holdings (AL-066), in the present case the Tribunal carefully applied the relevant sources of law. In

particular, the Respondent points out that the Tribunal examined the 2008 Transfer under Venezuelan law and

Below is a more detailed summary of the Respondent’s position on each of the annullable

errors identified by Gambrinus.

a. The Tribunal’s treatment of the 2008 Transfer as being void ab initio

The Respondent contends that the Applicant’s argument that the Tribunal manifestly
exceeded its powers by finding that the 2008 Transfer as being void ab initio must fail

because it is based on a defence that Gambrinus never raised before the Tribunal.

According to the Respondent, the Applicant’s argument regarding relative versus absolute
nullity suggests (i) that Venezuela had no standing to raise the inexistence of the 2008
Transfer in the arbitration proceeding and (ii) that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to
declare the investment non-existent.'® Yet, at no point did Gambrinus make these
submissions to the Tribunal.'® In fact, the Respondent notes that the Applicant requested
the Tribunal to decide on the validity of the 2008 Transfer when it included this question
in the joint list of questions submitted by the Parties to the Tribunal after the submission

of the post-hearing reply briefs (the “Joint List of Questions”).!©”

For the Respondent, the very fact that these defenses were not explicitly submitted by the
Applicant in any of its submissions is the best evidence that the Tribunal did not

“manifestly” exceed its powers by not subscribing them. !

In response to the Applicant’s argument that “the evidence showed” that under Venezuelan
law, even if Gambrinus had failed to comply with Section 6.7(i) of the JIA, the 2008

Transfer had to be given effect, the Respondent contends that the legal evidence submitted

concluded that it was ineffective because of the essential nature given to the “cash or cash equivalent” requirement.
See Respondent's letter of April 24, 2017.

165 Counter-Memorial on Annulment, § 264.

166 Rejoinder on Annulment, § 98. In response to the Applicant’s allegations that it had properly raised this issue before
the Tribunal, the Respondent contends that the “vague” references identified by Gambrinus (the footnote in the July
2014 Submission and the sentence in the 2014 Post-Hearing Reply) cannot, “under any possible definition, qualify as
an objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.” Additionally, the Respondent contends that the statements made in the
Rodner Opinion on this issue cannot be considered as an integral part of Grambrinus’ submissions, since it was not
the role of the legal expert to present objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction that Gambrinus had failed to submit. See
Rejoinder on Annulment, {J 100 to 104.

by the Parties in this regard differed. The Respondent points out that, in contrast with the
views of Mr. Rodner (which were not even endorsed in Gambrinus’ submission), the
evidence submitted by Venezuela, including the opinion of Dr. Garcia Montoya, “showed
that the parties had agreed on the consequences of such a failure in the JIA and the By-
Laws and that, pursuant to these specific provisions, the [2008 Transfer] had no effect ipso

iure.””'®

The Respondent contends that, contrary to what is argued by the Applicant, the findings of
the ad hoc committee in Occidental v. Ecuador in no way support Gambrinus’ application
for annulment. According to the Respondent, the issue at stake in such a case was whether
the majority of the tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers when granting to
Occidental a compensation based on 100% of the value of a participation contract in an oil
field while 40% of this amount corresponded to the rights assigned to Andes (a Chinese

company not protected by the investment treaty between Ecuador and the United States).'”°

For the Respondent, Gambrinus’ attempts to apply the findings of the ad hoc committee in

Occidental y. Ecuador to this case must fail for several reasons.

First, the Respondent notes that while Occidental was seeking to benefit from its own
breach of Ecuadorian law by inflating the amount of compensation it was claiming against
Ecuador, in the present case Venezuela showed that Gamrbinus had failed to make an
investment under the BIT because of Gambrinus’ failure to comply with an essential

contractual requirement. !7!

The Respondent also points out that an essential finding of the Occidental ad hoc
committee was the contradictory reasoning of the tribunal, which had based its decision on

the inexistence of the assignment of rights to Andes while at the same time recognizing

Andes’ rights in order to justify its conclusion. Instead, in the present case Gambrinus has

failed to show any such contradiction. !7”

Additionally, the Respondent argues that the governing law in this case is Venezuelan law
and therefore Gambrinus cannot simply extrapolate some of the findings of the Occidental
committee regarding Ecuadorian laws and Ecuadorian Supreme Court decisions and claim

that the same principles apply to this case.'”

Furthermore, the Respondent notes that the Occidental v, Ecuador case concerned the
consequences of a failure to obtain a relevant authorization under the Ecuadorian
Hydrocarbon Law, and that under the Ecuadorian Civil Code such a failure would entail
absolute nullity, which would need to be declared by a judge. The Respondent highlights
that, in contrast with the present case, these provisions of Ecuadorian law were discussed
at length before the Occidental tribunal. Furthermore, they are of no relevance for the case
at hand “where an essential contractual requirement was at stake, in relation to which the
JIA and Fertinitro’s By-Laws expressly provided that non-compliant transfers would
automatically be null, void and without effect [...], manifestly excluding any need for a

prior declaration by the judge.”!”*

b. The Tribunal’s application of the cash equivalency clause to inter-affiliate
transfers

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal applied the proper law to the interpretation of
Section 6.7(i) of the JIA and arrived to the conclusion that this provision applied to inter-

affiliate transfers.

The Tribunal assessed the weight to be given to the intention of the parties to the JIA,

applying the relevant rule of contract interpretation set forth in Article 12 of the Venezuelan

'% Td. See also Rejoinder on Annulment, § 108. Similarly, the Respondent also contends that Gambrinus’ arguments
regarding Prof. Iribarren expert opinion in Crysta/lex (AL-018) must fail, because such case concerned the validity
of the decision of a public organ in Venezuela “which is inapposite to issues of Venezuelan private contract law,
pursuant to which the parties are free to agree that a failure to comply with certain essential requirements would
automatically result in share transfers being ‘null, void and of no force or effect.”” See Counter-Memorial on
Annulment, {| 278. See also Rejoinder on Annulment, 4 109.

37

Code of Civil Procedure, which had been relied upon by both Parties’ legal experts. On
this basis, the Tribunal reached the conclusion that: (i) the intention of the parties would
only take precedence over the contract language in case the contractual provisions were
obscure, ambiguous or deficient; and (ii) “because Article 6.7(i) of the JIA clearly applied
on its face to all transfers — and as such contained no ‘obscurity, ambiguity or deficiency’
- the Tribunal was not entitled under Venezuelan law to simply disregard it in the light of

any alleged ‘purpose’ or ‘real intention’ of the parties.”!75
y ged “purps Pi

142. Thus, for the Respondent, the Tribunal relied on the relevant Venezuelan law on the record
and applied it to the facts of the case.'7° As explained by the ad hoc committee in CDC v.
Seychelles,'7’ the fact that the Tribunal did not rely on the arguments put forward by

Gambrinus’ legal expert, does not mean that it failed to apply the proper law. 178

143. Furthermore, the Respondent contends that the Award clearly states the reasons which led
the Tribunal to this conclusion and such “reasons are consistent, they are not frivolous and
they enable the reader to understand how the Tribunal reached its conclusion in this

respect.”!7

144. Contrary to Gambrinus’ reading of the Award, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal did
not agree with Gambrinus that the application of Section 6.7(i) of the JIA to all permitted
dispositions would render these dispositions literally impossible, nor did it “explicitly
find,” as alleged by the Applicant, that cash equivalency served no purpose for inter-
affiliate or other permitted dispositions under the JIA.'*° If anything, the Tribunal simply

took note of the arguments put forward by Gambrinus and found that, pursuant to the

‘8 The Respondent notes that its legal expert, Dr. Garcia Montoya, demonstrated that, in the absence of obscurity,
ambiguity or deficiency, the text of the contract prevailed as an expression of the intention of the parties under
Venezuelan law and, according to the Respondent, the Tribunal upheld the argument of Dr. Garcia Montoya on this
point. Rejoinder on Annulment, {fj 51 and 52.

"79 Counter-Memorial on Annulment, 214.

180 The Respondent also argues that Gambrinus’ allegation that the Tribunal identified a contractual ambiguity both
within the Fertinitro By-Laws and between the Fertinitro By-Laws and the JIA is wrong. On the contrary, after
carefully analyzing the text of the different relevant provisions in the By-Laws, the Tribunal expressly found that there
was no ambiguity. Rejoinder on Annulment, {| 47 to 50.

relevant principles of interpretation under Venezuelan law, a determination on these points

was immaterial and, therefore, unnecessary. !*!

c. The Tribunal’s conclusion on whether the 2008 Transfer involved
cash/cash-consideration
145. The Respondent contends that the Tribunal applied the proper law when assessing whether
the 2008 Transfer had been made in accordance with the cash equivalency requirement set
forth in Section 6.7(i) of the JIA. In doing this assessment, the Tribunal agreed with the
Respondent’s submission and legal expert’s opinion that, under Venezuelan law, the
Gambrinus’ shares are not “cash equivalent” since they are not readily convertible into
cash on a short-term basis.'*? Contrary to Gambrinus’ suggestion, when reaching this
conclusion, the Tribunal did not even refer to (let alone exclusively rely on) the standard

provided by IAS 7.!8

146. In this regard, the Respondent argues that there can be no doubt that the Tribunal sought to
apply Venezuelan law and that Gambrinus should not use this annulment proceeding to
challenge whether the Tribunal was right in its conclusion, since this would go to the
substance of the Tribunal’s decision and as such, as explained in Continental Casualty v.

Argentina,'** cannot amount to a manifest excess of power. '*5

d. The Tribunal’s conclusion regarding the Common Share Subscription
Agreement

147. In response to Gambrinus’ argument regarding the alleged inconsistency in the Tribunal

“non-textual” approach when qualifying the Common Share Subscription Agreement as a

182 Counter-Memorial on Annulment, §{] 247 and 248.

183 Jd. 4/250. In response to the Applicant’s argument regarding the Tribunal’s alleged failure to address Mr. Rodner’s

opinion as to whether a set-off of monetary obligations had to be regarded as satisfying the cash equivalency

requirement, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal was under no duty to address this, given that the issue was

irrelevant in light of the Tribunal’s finding that the Common Share Subscription Agreement was a share-for-share
i joi on i 457 to 62. h the dent argues that the Applicant’s arguments

in this regard are misleading since the mere fact that an obligation is denominated in money is completely irrelevant

when assessing whether such obligation has been paid in cash or cash equivalency, as required by the JIA. Rejoinder

“share-for-share” transaction, the Respondent argues that the Applicant has failed to show

how this allegation could be relevant for the purpose of the annulment.

For the Respondent, the fact that the Applicant is not convinced by the reasons put forward

by the Tribunal is irrelevant since, as explained in E/ Paso v. Argentina,'*6

unconvincing
reasons do not amount to lack of reasons and thus it is not within the power of an ad hoc
committee to decide whether it agrees or disagrees with the reasons expressed by the

tribunal.'*7

e. The Tribunal’s failure to address and apply the 5-year prescription period

Citing Wena v. Egypt,'’® the Respondent argues that a tribunal cannot reasonably be
expected to respond in its reasoning to a defense which was never articulated by any of the
parties. '*° In this regard, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal did not fail to address
and apply the 5-year prescription simply because the Applicant never submitted that

Venezuela’s jurisdictional objection based on the 2008 Transfer was time-barred. 190

For the Respondent, the only reference to the prescription period in Gambrinus’
submissions appears in a footnote of its July 2014 Submission, in which it both misread
and criticized Venezuela’s legal expert argument in this regard. The Respondent notes that
the Applicant did not put forward in that submission — or in any of its subsequent briefs —
any defense that the Respondent’s objection should be declared time-barred and dismissed.
Similarly, the Respondent adds that nowhere did Gambrinus’ legal expert, Mr. Rodner,

opine on the issue.'9!

Furthermore, the Respondent points out that the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit a list
of the questions that they deemed should be addressed in the Award and that Gambrinus

did not include the prescription period issue in this list.'°?

fi The Tribunal’s failure to apply and address relevant international law

With regards to the Applicant’s argument that the Tribunal failed to address relevant
principles of international law, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal had no reason to
address the awards cited by Gambrinus, since such awards dealt with the scope of the
provision contained or implied in some investment treaties that investment must be made
in accordance with the host State law and were thus irrelevant and immaterial to the

Tribunal’s decision. !%

(3) The Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure

Contrary to the Applicant’s arguments on the Respondent’s “ambush tactics,” the
Respondent contends that its JIA Defense was a legitimate complement to its jurisdictional
objection based on the lack of Gambrinus’ investment, which was prompted by Gambrinus’

late submission of the details of the 2008 Transfer. !%*

The Respondent further argues that, contrary to the Applicant’s suggestion, under the
Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 1 the Tribunal had the discretion to authorize (or not) a
supplement to the Parties’ written submissions and it was in the light of this power that the

Tribunal admitted the Respondent’s JIA Defense. '°°

The Respondent points out that the procedures put in place by the Tribunal in Procedural
Order No. 2 were in no way imposed upon the Applicant. On the contrary, the Respondent
argues that the Applicant “specifically suggested, negotiated and agreed on the very

procedural arrangements that it now claims ‘failed to erase the imbalance that arose at the

hearing.’”!° In this regard, according to the Respondent, the fact that Gambrinus objected
to the introduction of the JIA Defense is irrelevant. What matters is that Gambrinus never
raised any objection in relation to the subsequent post-hearing procedure agreed to ensure

Gambrinus’ right to be heard.'°7

156. Furthermore, the Respondent notes that the post-hearing phase agreed by the Parties lasted
more than six months and that throughout this time Gambrinus never took issue with the
agreed procedure, nor did it request that this procedure be amended or that further

arrangements be put in place.'%

157. On this basis, the Respondent contends that, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 27, the Applicant
is precluded form alleging that the established procedure constituted a serious departure

from a fundamental rule of procedure.'””

158. In any event, the Respondent argues that the procedure was fair to both Parties,
guaranteeing the right to be heard and the equality between both Parties.” In this regard,
the Respondent notes that the Parties were given the opportunity to submit specific written
submissions and a legal opinion dealing exclusively with the JIA Defense and that

Gambrinus had yet another opportunity to supplement this submission or to rebut the points

made by Venezuela in two rounds of post-hearing briefs and reply briefs.?°!

19 Counter-Memorial on Annulment, 4 185. Among other things, the Respondent highlights that, contrary to the
Applicant’s suggestion that it was precluded from submitting evidence after the Arbitration Hearing, Gambrinus
expressly agreed that no further factual evidence would be submitted in the post-hearing brief. Counter-Memorial on
Annulment, § 189.

197 Rejoinder on Annulment, $23. In this sense, the Respondent highlights that it was Gambrinus’ counsel who, when
they objected to the introduction of the JIA Defense by the Respondent at the Arbitration Hearing, requested that they
be able to address this issue in written submissions. The Respondent notes that “[t]he bulk of these procedural
arrangements — and not only their ‘timetable’ — were then negotiated between the Parties’ respective counsel, who
reached an agreement on all aspects of the procedure to be implemented — including the number, content, order,
calendar and length of submissions and the extent of any evidence to be enclosed.” According to the Respondent, in
fact, the principle that this issue would be addressed in specific submissions before post-hearing briefs was agreed
before the exact “timetable” for such submissions was set. Rejoinder on Annulment, {ff 24 to 26.

Defense during the Arbitration Hearing constitutes a violation of its fundamental right to
present its case, the Respondent contends that Arbitration Rule 29 expressly contemplates
the possibility for the Parties to agree that all or some issues be addressed on a document-

only basis, with no hearing.”°

Gambrinus was clearly given the opportunity to present its position on the JIA Defense, the “principe du
contradictoire” was fully complied with in the present case. Rejoinder on Annulment, § 30.

ANALYSIS
Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:

(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an
application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or
more of the following grounds:

a. that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;

b. that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;

c. that there was corruption on the part of a member of the
Tribunal;

d._ that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule
of procedure; or

e. that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is
based.

ARTICLE 52(1)(B) — MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS
(i) Relevant Standard of Review

The Applicant seeks annulment pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The
underlying arguments on which the Applicant relies upon to seek annulment on this ground
are to some extent common to the ones used to seek annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of
the ICSID Convention. It should be noted that the standard to set aside an award under the
two provisions is neither similar nor identical. The Committee will, despite the reliance by
the Applicant on similar underlying arguments, deal with the application for annulment

under the two provisions separately.
The ad hoc committee in the K/éckner J annulment decision stated as follows:

[A]ln arbitral tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction, whether said to be
partial or total, necessarily comes within the scope of an “excess of
powers” under Article 52(1)(b).?

The ground of manifest excess of power is not merely limited to lack of jurisdiction. This

ground of annulment is also applicable when the tribunal disregards the applicable law or

grounds its decision in the award on a law other than the law applicable under Article 42
of the ICSID Convention.”

164. The ad hoc committee in the CMS annulment decision stated as follows:

A complete failure to apply the law which a tribunal is directed by
Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention can also constitute a manifest
excess of powers.”

165. There is a distinction between non-application of the applicable law and an incorrect
application of the applicable law. The former is a ground for annulment while the latter is

not.206
166. Inthe annulment decision in MINE, the committee stated as follows:

Disregard of the applicable rules of law must be distinguished from
erroneous application of those rules which, even if manifestly
unwarranted, furnishes no ground for annulment.?°"

167. The Committee is of the view that in order for the Award to be annulled under this ground,
there are two requirements. First, the Tribunal must have exceeded its powers by “deciding
questions” not submitted to it or refusing to decide questions properly before it, or by

failing to apply the proper law.?°8 Second, the excess must be manifest. The excess of

power must be “obvious, evident, clear, self-evident and extremely serious.”?”

(2) The Annullable Errors Identified by the Applicant under the Ground of
Manifest Excess of Powers

As explained above, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal committed annullable errors
that constitute a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention
in six (6) different ways: (i) in its treatment of the 2008 Transfer as being void ab initio;
(ii) in its application of the cash equivalency clause to inter-affiliate transfers; (iii) in its
conclusion on whether the 2008 Transfer involved cash/cash-consideration; (iv) in its
conclusion regarding the Common Share Subscription Agreement; (v) in its failure to
address and apply the 5-year prescription period; and (vi) in its failure to apply and address

relevant international law. The Committee will now analyze each one of them.

a. The Tribunal’s treatment of the 2008 Transfer as being void ab initio

The contention of the Applicant is that the Tribunal’s conclusion that the 2008 Transfer
was void due to Gambrinus’ failure to abide by the cash equivalency requirement of
Section 6.7(1) of the JIA represents a manifest excess of jurisdiction. The contention of
Gambrinus is that, even if the transfer was a technical non-compliance of Article VI of the
JIA and Chapter III of the Fertinitro By-Laws, quod non, it would merely be a technical
breach and therefore the 2008 Transfer should not have been treated by the Tribunal as

being null and void.

The Applicant relies heavily on the annulment decision in Occidental v Ecuador?" to

further argue that the 2008 Transfer was valid and effective until declared otherwise by the
competent court under the JIA (i.e. arbitral tribunal under the rules of the International
Chamber of Commerce) and not by the Tribunal. Gambrinus also relies on the expert
opinion provided by the Respondent’s legal expert, Prof. Iribarren, in Crystallex

201

International Corp v Venezuela" and on the opinion of its own expert, Mr. Rodner.

The Respondent, on the other hand, contends that Gambrinus is in effect putting forward

an entirely new defence.

The Committee notes that the question of whether failure to comply by the cash
equivalency requirement would render the contract voidable as opposed to it being void ab
initio was not in the Joint List of Questions submitted to the Tribunal. Hence, the Tribunal

cannot be reproached for not having addressed the issue that it was not asked to consider.?!2

The Tribunal in the Award considered Article VI of the JIA and in particular Section 6.7(i)
and held that the transfer of the Fertinitro shares was null and void and of no effect. The
Tribunal was not asked to consider whether the transfer was voidable and hence the

Tribunal cannot be faulted for its decision.

The Committee is also of the view that the Tribunal did not have to decide whether the
2008 Transfer can be said to be a nullity before a competent court made such a
determination in view of the fact that the issue was not raised nor argued comprehensively

before the Tribunal.

When arguments were addressed during the Hearing on Annulment with regard to the
Occidental annulment decision, the Committee asked the Applicant whether Venezuelan
law and Ecuadorian law on this issue are sufficiently similar for the decision in Occidental
to be applicable to the present proceedings.”!3_ The Committee was not able to obtain a
satisfactory answer from the Applicant. The Respondent submitted that the Venezuelan
Civil Code does not include an equivalent provision to Article 1698 of the Ecuadorian Civil
Code.

It should be noted that in the Occidental case, the issue of whether a competent court should
declare whether the transfer of shares was null or void ab initio was raised before the
tribunal, whereas in the present case this issue is being raised for the very first time before
the Committee. In this regard, it should also be noted that this was an issue that was not

included among the Joint List of Questions?" that the parties submitted to the Tribunal.

181.

182.

In light of the above, the decision in Occidental whilst being persuasive, is distinguishable

on the facts and in law and is not applicable to the present dispute.

The Committee is therefore of the view that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its

powers.

b. The Tribunal’s application of the cash equivalency clause to inter-affiliate
transfers
The Applicant’s principal argument is that, when determining whether the cash
equivalency requirement applied to inter-affiliate transfers, the Tribunal manifestly failed
to ascertain and apply the real intent of the parties under the JIA and the Fertinitro By-

Laws, as required under Venezuelan law and thus, failed to apply the proper law.

The Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal applied Venezuelan law. In particular, the
Tribunal considered Article 12 of the Venezuelan Code of Civil Procedure in order to

interpret the JIA and the Fertinitro By-Laws. Article 12 reads as follows:

En la interpretacién de contratos o actos que presenten oscuridad,
ambigiiedad o deficiencia, los jueces se atendran al propdsito y a la
intencion de las partes o de los otorgantes, teniendo en mira las
exigencias de la Ley, de la verdad y de la buena fe.

The English translation reads as follows:

When interpreting contracts that are obscure, ambiguous or,

defective the judge shall look to the purpose and intention of the

parties or the issuer, taking into account the requirements of the

law, truth and good faith. [emphasis added]
In applying this Article, the Tribunal analysed the provisions of the JIA regulating the
transfer of shares, including the cash equivalency requirement under Section 6(7)(i), and
came to the conclusion that there was no obscurity ambiguity or deficiency in such
provisions and that, therefore, it was not allowed to look beyond the plain contract language

which required all transfers to be made for cash or cash equivalent.?!°

215 Award, ff 265 and 266.

48

183. The Tribunal also carefully analysed the Applicant’s argument that Article 12 of the
Fertinitro By-Laws does not subject inter-affiliate transfers to a cash equivalency
requirement. It was further argued that Article 14 of the Fertinitro By-Laws is subordinate
to Article 12 and that, in light of the conflict with Section 6 of the JIA, the Tribunal should

have analysed or ascertained the real intention of the parties.

184. The Tribunal expressly dealt with these issues in its Award.”!° It first stated that there is no

prevalence of the Fertinitro By-Laws over the text of the JIA.

185. It then considered Articles 12 and 14 of the Fertinitro By-Laws and came to the conclusion
that there was no conflict between the Fertinitro By-Laws and the JIA by holding as

follows:

The Tribunal notes that differently from Section 6.2 of the JIA which
makes any Disposition of shares, not excluding transfers to
Affiliates, subject to the condition of a “cash or cash equivalents”
consideration under Section 6.7(i), no similar condition is
apparently prescribed by the Fertinitro By-Laws regarding
transfers to Affiliates. Under Article 12 of the By-Laws (entitled
“Exception to the Restriction on Disposal and Encumbrance of
Company Shares”), the shareholders may transfer or confer rights
on their shares without being obligated to comply with the
provisions of Chapter III (inclusive of Articles 11 to 15), “except
where provided for under paragraph three of clause thirteen,” in
case (under B) of disposal of shares to Affiliates. Paragraph three
of Article 13, dealing with “Transfers to Third Parties,” is no
exception to the unconditioned disposal of shares to Affiliates under
Article 12, considering that transfers to Affiliates are not transfers
to Third Parties.?!”

However, the conflict is removed by the starting language of Article
14, making its provisions applicable “[n]otwithstanding any other
provision contained in these Articles of Incorporation/ By-Laws,”
the reference to any other provision including Article 12.7!

The prevalence of Article 14 over the exemption of transfer to
Affiliates under Article 12 is confirmed by the last part of same
Article 14, providing (under B) that “[a]ny disposal or transfer of

Company shares must be carried out pursuant to the provisions

contained in the Agreement,” where “Agreement” cannot but refer

to the JIA. Also under the By-Laws, therefore, transfers of shares to

Affiliates are subject for their validity to the condition of payment

being made in cash or cash equivalents, as provided by Section

6.7(i) of the JIA?”
The Committee considers that the proper law that had to be applied is Venezuelan law and
that the Tribunal was mandated to interpret the provisions of the JIA and the Fertinitro By-
Laws to ensure that the transfer of the Fertinitro shares to the Applicant complied with

Venezuelan law.

The Tribunal did just that. It interpreted the provisions of the JIA and the Fertinitro By-
Laws in accordance with Venezuelan law and expressly dealt with the relationship between

the JIA and the Fertinitro By-Laws, as explained above.

Accordingly, in the Committee view, the Tribunal cannot be faulted in its application of
Venezuelan law and its interpretation of the latter does not give rise to a manifest excess

of power.

c. The Tribunal’s conclusion on whether or not the 2008 Transfer involved
cash/cash consideration
The Applicant contends that the Tribunal’s reliance on IAS 7 for defining cash or cash
equivalency is flawed?° and constitutes a manifest excess of power, as it represented the
failure to apply proper principles of Venezuelan law. The Applicant further contends that
IAS 7 has no status under Venezuelan law. It also contends that IAS 7 was introduced in

breach of the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 2.

According to the Applicant, Venezuelan law recognizes set-off as a proper manner of
discharging money obligations. The Applicant further contends that the Tribunal failed to
discuss and apply the principles of set-off, while these principles are part of Venezuelan

law, in particular Article 1333 of the Venezuelan Civil Code.

In the Award, the Tribunal did allude to the issue of set-off.”?! It also referred to Mr.
Rodner’s opinion as to whether the set-off of money obligations would satisfy the
requirements of Section 6.7 of the JIA and came to the conclusion that the transfer of shares
did not comply with such requirement. Accordingly, there is no merit in the Applicant’s
argument that the Tribunal did not address the issue of the set-off and thereby committed

an annullable error.

Furthermore, contrary to what is argued by the Applicant, the Tribunal did not rely upon

IAS 7 for its conclusion.

Therefore, the Committee is of the view that the Tribunal considered in the Award whether
the 2008 Transfer complied with the cash equivalency requirement under Venezuelan law

and its interpretation does not give rise to a manifest excess of powers.

d. The Tribunal’s conclusion regarding the Common Share Subscription
Agreement

As explained above, Gambrinus argues that, while the Tribunal applied a strict literalist
approach to the JIA, it applied a non-textual approach when it construed the Common Share
Subscription Agreement “as ‘converting’ the terms of the January 2008 Share Purchase
Agreement into an agreement to engage in a share-for-share transaction.”?2? According to
the Applicant, the Award’s failure to reconcile this different approaches leads to an
unexplained inconsistency in its treatment of the cash equivalency requirement which
represents a manifest excess of powers of the Tribunal under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID

Convention (as well as a failure to state the reasons under Article 52(1)(e)).

The Respondent takes the view that there is no error in the manner in which the Tribunal
construed the Common Share Subscription Agreement. It further takes the view that it is
not within the purview of an ad hoc committee to decide whether it agrees or disagrees

with the reasons expressed by the Tribunal.

197.

199,

200.

Having considered both the arguments of Gambrinus and Venezuela on this issue, the
Committee is of the view that there is no merit in Gambrinus’ argument. The Tribunal has
given reasons as to the manner in which it construes the JIA, the Fertinitro By-Laws and

the Common Share Subscription Agreement.

In the Committee’s view, these reasons are not frivolous. It is not within the powers of the
Committee to decide whether it agrees or disagrees with the conclusion of the Tribunal.
The Committee may only assess whether, in reaching its conclusion, the Tribunal

manifestly exceeded its powers.

e. The Tribunal’s alleged failure to address and apply the 5-year prescription
period
The argument of the Applicant is that, pursuant to the Venezuelan Civil Code Article 1346
and the Fertinitro By-Laws, a 5-year prescription period was applicable for nullity actions.
The Applicant contends that the Tribunal did not address the issue of the prescription

period.

This was another issue that was not raised by the Applicant in the Joint List of Questions
that the Tribunal was requested to consider. The only reference to the issue of limitation
or prescription period is in footnote 57 of the July 2014 Submission. The Committee is
therefore of the view that the Tribunal cannot be faulted in not addressing the issue of
prescription period or limitation when it was not raised specifically as an issue or argued
in extensor by the Applicant before the Tribunal.
fi The Tribunal’s alleged failure to apply and address relevant international
law

The argument of the Applicant is that the Tribunal did not address or take into account the
principle of public international law that purported minor technical non-compliance with
contractual or regulatory provisions - such as the cash equivalency requirement set out in

Section 6.7 of the JIA -, cannot deprive an investor of its treaty rights under international

52

201.

202.

203.

204,

law, “particularly where the alleged technical error arose from a good faith

misunderstanding.”2”? The Applicant relied on 4 authorities in its submissions.”

The Committee is of the view that the contractual provisions of an underlying agreement

may not be minor technical defects which can be disregarded.

Further, the Committee has also considered very carefully the 4 authorities cited by the
Applicant and they relate to whether the claimants had a protected investment under the
different applicable bilateral investment treaties given the alleged failure of the investors
to comply with the laws of the host State when making their investments. However, the
issue in this annulment proceeding is not whether Gambrinus failed to comply with local
legislation thereby losing the procedural protections granted by the BIT. Thus, the
Committee agrees with the Respondent that the authorities are neither relevant nor
applicable. In the present case, there was no investment within the meaning of the JIA,

read with the BIT and the laws of Venezuela.

The Committee is therefore of the view that the Tribunal did not make a manifest error in
not dealing with the international law argument specified in paragraph 200 above, as it was

not applicable.

ARTICLE 52(1)(E) — FAILURE TO STATE THE REASONS
(ld) Relevant Standard of Review

Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:

(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an
application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or
more of the following grounds:

(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.

This Article is connected to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention according to which:

(3) The award shall deal with every question submitted to the

Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.
The annulment committee in MINE v. Guinea”®> held that to annul an award under Article
52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the committee has to ascertain how the tribunal
proceeded from Point A to Point B in arriving at its decision and stated the test in the

following words:

In the Committee’s view, the requirement to state the reasons is

satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal

proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion,

even if it made an error of fact or law.
In Wena Hotels v. Egypt the annulment committee was of the view that when construing
Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the committee is not empowered to reconsider
“whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal’s decisions were appropriate or not,

convincing or not.”2?6

Furthermore, as stated by the TECO v. Guatemala and other annulment committees,??’ the
Tribunal’s failure to address “every argument, piece of evidence or authority in the record”

is not a ground for annulment.??

The Committee has considered the pronouncements of the ad hoc committees that are
referred to in the preceding paragraphs and will apply the principles enunciated in those

cases in its analysis.

(2) The Annullable Errors Identified by the Applicant under the Ground of
Failure to State the Reasons

The Committee sought to determine how the Tribunal arrived at its decision that

jurisdiction did not exist under the ICSID Convention in respect of Gambrinus’ claim. The

213.

Tribunal had to determine whether the Applicant is a protected foreign investor within the
meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention read with Article 1(a) of the BIT. In the
Committee’s view, after having considered all the arguments of the Applicant and the
Respondent, the Tribunal correctly expressed the reasons on which its conclusion is based,

in the following terms:

Claimant owned no investment at the time of the alleged

expropriation of Fertinitro shares on 10 October 2010, due to the

Share Purchase Agreement with Inv. Polar being of no force and

effect. Having made no investment which may fall within the BIT

protection, Claimant’s claim is not subject to the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction which, accordingly, must be declined.”
As explained above, the Applicant has identified five (5) annullable errors under Article
52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. In particular, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal
failed to state the reasons upon which the Award is based: (i) in its application of the cash
equivalency clause to inter-affiliate transfers; (ii) in its conclusion on whether the 2008
Transfer involved cash/cash-consideration; (iii) in its conclusion regarding the Common
Share Subscription Agreement; (iv) in its failure to address and apply the 5-year
prescription period and (v) in its failure to apply and address relevant international law.

The Committee will now consider these five (5) arguments.

The Committee has dealt with the arguments (iii) to (v) when considering the Applicant’s
arguments under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. It will adopt the reasons and
conclusions set out therein. As to the arguments under (i) and (ii) above, the Committee is
of the view that these two arguments raised by the Applicant are inter-related and can be

dealt with together.

This necessitates a determination of whether it is possible to follow the Tribunal’s
construction of the sections of the JIA and the By-Laws which regulate the transfer of the

Fertinitro shares and the reasons for the Tribunal’s conclusion.

In the Award,2*° the Tribunal construed the provisions of Article VI of the JIA, in particular
Sections 6.1 and 6.2 which deal with restrictions on transfer and permitted dispositions.
The Tribunal also considered Section 6.7(i) in particular, which provides “that any
disposition shall be made exclusively for cash or cash equivalent to the exclusion of any

other consideration.”

The Tribunal considered the Fertinitro By-Laws and also the argument of the Applicant
that the Fertinitro By-Laws are inconsistent with the JIA and concluded that there was no

conflict between the provisions of the two instruments regarding the transfer of shares.

The Tribunal considered Article 12 of the Venezuelan Code of Civil Procedure, which was
relied on by both experts, and noted that the Parties and their legal experts had discussed
the rules of interpretation of Venezuelan law and that they reached different conclusions.
The Tribunal came to the conclusion that the intention of the parties to the JIA had to be

considered only if there was any ambiguity, as a supplementary means of interpretation.

The Tribunal further concluded that there was no obscurity, ambiguity or deficiency in the
interpretation of Section 6.7(i) and that, therefore, the alleged intention of the parties should

not take precedence over the contract language.

In considering these provisions of the JIA, the Tribunal did not accept the Applicant’s
argument that despite the clear wording of Section 6.7(i), such Section was not applicable
to transfers to affiliates. The Tribunal also did not accept Gambrinus’ additional argument
that the Fertinitro By-Laws were inconsistent with the JIA. In fact, the Tribunal took the
view that when the Sections of the JIA and the Fertinitro By-Laws were considered, they

had the same effect.

The Tribunal then went on to deal with the Respondent’s argument that the share-for-share
transaction which Gambrinus relied upon as being in compliance with the JIA, was
untenable because the shares in Gambrinus are not of cash equivalent. The Tribunal agreed

with the Respondent that the shares in the Applicant are not a cash equivalent due to the

280 Jd., 4247.

56

220.

221.

222.

223.

224.

reason that they are not immediately realisable liquid assets since they are not traded

publicly.

The Tribunal subsequently considered the consequences of a breach of the JIA in particular
Section 6.1 which provided that no owner of the shares shall sell its shares save in
compliance with the provisions of Article VI and non-compliance with Article VI shall
cause the transfer to be null, void and of no force or effect. The Tribunal therefore
concluded that the 2008 Transfer could not be given effect to because the essential
provisions of the JIA had not been complied with as there was no cash or cash equivalent

provided for in respect of the sale of shares in the Common Share Subscription Agreement.
231

Gambrinus did not explicitly plead that the evidence showed that, even if Gambrinus had
failed to comply with Section 6.7 of the JIA, the transfer had to be given effect. Before the
Tribunal there was the expert opinions of Mr. Rodner and Dr. Garcia Montoya and it was
up to the Tribunal to decide which of the two experts it found more persuasive and the fact

that it preferred the evidence of one expert is not an annullable error.

In the Committee’s view, the Tribunal stated the reasons on which the conclusion is based

and therefore cannot be faulted. In the circumstances, there is no annullable error as such.

Gambrinus further argued that, in order to declare the 2008 Transfer null and void, there
has to be a declaration by a competent tribunal under the JIA, namely an arbitral tribunal
established pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce.
However, the Committee agrees with Venezuela that such argument was not in the Joint
List of Questions that was submitted to the Tribunal nor was it explicitly pleaded before

the Tribunal. Hence, the Tribunal was not in error in not dealing with this issue.

In conclusion, the Committee is of the view that in reading the Award one is able to proceed
from Point A to Point B and does not find that the reasons given by the Tribunal for holding
that it has no jurisdiction are frivolous or contradictory. In the Committee’s view, the

Tribunal has painstakingly construed the provisions of the JIA, the Fertinitro By-Laws and

231 Jd., 99272, 273, 265, 267.

57

225.

226.

227.

228.

Venezuelan law, in coming to the conclusion that the provisions of the JIA and the By-

Laws were not complied with by Gambrinus in respect of the transfer of shares.

The Committee therefore finds no merit in respect of the request by Gambrinus to annul

the Award pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.

ARTICLE 52(1)(D) — SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF
PROCEDURE

(l) Relevant Standard of Review

Article 52(1)(d) reads as follows:

Either party may request annulment of the award by an application
in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the
following grounds:

(@) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule

of procedure...
The critical words in Article 52(1)(d) are “serious” and “fundamental.” There has been
an adoption of a dual analysis by ad hoc committees that the departure from a rule of

procedure must be “serious” and the rule of procedure must be “fundamental.”?*?

The Committee is of the view that the right to be heard and to be able to present one’s case
is a fundamental principle encompassed within Article 52(1)(d). The Committee therefore
has to determine whether the Tribunal has violated the Applicant’s right to be heard in
delivering its Award. The Committee should be concerned with the essential fairness of
the proceedings.”*? Another important consideration is whether the breach is serious and

“could potentially have affected the award.”?34

The Committee also refers to the annulment decision in Vivendi»? where the committee

held as follows:

[u]nder Article 52(1)(d), the emphasis is clearly on the term “rule
of procedure,” that is, on the manner in which the Tribunal
proceeded, not on the content of its decision.

In the MINE annulment decision,?*°

it was held that for this ground of annulment to be
operative, the departure from the rule of procedure must be a “serious one” and the rule of

procedure which is breached must be “fundamental.”
In the Wena Hotels annulment decision?’ it was held that:

In order to be a “serious” departure from a fundamental rule of
procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the
Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would
have awarded had such a rule been observed.

The Committee agrees with the standard set out in the decisions that the Committee has
referred to in the preceding paragraphs. The Committee will now apply those principles to
determine whether the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure

as alleged by Gambrinus.

(2) The alleged annullable error

The Applicant contends that the introduction of the JIA Defense during the first day of the
Arbitration Hearing on March 10, 2014 breached a fundamental procedural principle of
equality of treatment and equal right to be heard and that this created a fundamental
imbalance at the Arbitration Hearing, namely that the Respondent was able to present
arguments and evidence on the JIA Defense whilst the Claimant was deprived of that
opportunity. The Applicant further contends that the post-hearing procedure did not rectify

the prejudice caused by that imbalance.

The Committee is of the view that in order to determine whether the submissions of the
Applicant can constitute a breach of Article 52(1)(d), it is necessary to consider what

transpired before, during and after the Arbitration Hearing.

a. Pre-Hearing Developments

Gambrinus filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction Merits and Quantum on November 30, 2012
accompanied by a witness statement of Mr. Reinaldo Gabaldon and an expert report which
evidenced that Polar had agreed to transfer its shares in Fertinitro to Gambrinus for USD

80 million pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement.

The Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction Merits and Quantum on May
17, 2013 which was accompanied by witness statements, legal opinions and a valuation

report.

Gambrinus filed its Reply on Merits and its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on August
30, 2013 accompanied by a witness statement, legal opinion and an expert report and a

valuation report.

The Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Merits and Quantum on November 29,

2013 accompanied by witness statements as well as legal opinions and a valuation report.

Gambrinus filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on January 17, 2014 accompanied by a

witness statement and a valuation report.

The contention of the Respondent is that the Applicant produced no evidence of its title in
its Request for Arbitration, as the only exhibit relating to share transfer was the Notice of

Waiver dated January 22, 2008.

The Respondent contends that when the Memorial of the Applicant dated November 30,
2012 was filed, the Applicant produced the Share Purchase Agreement which provided a
transfer of the shares to Gambrinus for a price of USD 80 million to be paid at a future
date. The Respondent contends that Gambrinus in its Counter-Memorial of May 17, 2013

produced the Common Share Subscription Agreement.

The Respondent contends that Gambrinus in its Rejoinder of January 17, 2014 admitted
that a share-for-share transaction had taken place and that no cash had been paid and that

this was confirmed by the Applicant’s counsel.

The Committee is of the view that the issue of whether Gambrinus had paid for the shares
in cash within the meaning of Section 6.7(i) of the JIA was an important issue pertaining
to jurisdiction. It should have been one of the principal issues that the Respondent should
have considered when the arbitration commenced. The issue that the Committee has to
consider is whether the fact that the Tribunal considered the JIA Defense despite being
raised for the first time on March 10, 2014 during the Arbitration Hearing constitutes a
ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d). This necessitates a consideration of what

transpired at the Arbitration Hearing which commenced on March 10, 2014.

b. March 10, 2014 - Day 1

On February 17, 2014, Gambrinus indicated that it was not necessary to call Mr. Haberman
and Dr. Garcia Montoya for examination. The Hearing commenced on March 10, 2014
with the Claimant’s opening presentation. Gambrinus’ counsel addressed the Common
Share Subscription Agreement and argued that it did not matter whether cash or economic
detriment was sustained by Gamrbinus on January 24, 2008 or in February 2008 when

shares-for-shares were issued.

Gambrinus’ counsel was specifically asked by the Chairman of the Tribunal whether the
sum of USD 80 million was actually paid by Gambrinus. Gambrinus’ counsel’s response
was that cash was not paid but what was done was that the assets were acquired by

Gambrinus in exchange for shares.?°*

The Respondent in addressing the 2008 Transfer submitted that this raised a jurisdictional
issue, namely, that there was no investment and the Tribunal had no jurisdiction.

Venezuela relied on the provisions of Section 6.7 of the JIA which required that “any

disposition shall be made exclusively for cash or cash equivalent to the exclusion of any

other consideration.”

Gambrinus’ counsel intervened at that point to state that the issue of non-compliance with
Section 6.7 of the JIA had not been specifically pleaded and that this was a new argument.
Gambrinus took the view that this new argument could be addressed through proper

briefing during closing arguments and written memorials.”

ec. March 11, 2014 — Day 2

Gambrinus took the view that the Respondent had to make a formal application to raise

this new argument in view of the provisions of the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 1.

The Arbitration Hearing before the Tribunal proceeded with the examination of Mr.
Gabaldon and objections were raised by the Gambrinus’ counsel with regard to questions

posed by Venezuela which Gambrinus submitted were in respect of the “new” argument.

d. March 12, 2014 — Day 3

There appears to have been a dialogue between the Parties and discussions had taken place
as to how the post-hearing arrangements could address the JIA Defense. Gambrinus’
counsel then informed the Tribunal that there had been a “constructive dialogue” and that

discussions were taking place about the timing and structure of the post-hearing briefing.””°

The Respondent’s counsel formally applied to raise the JIA Defense. The Tribunal having
heard arguments, adjourned and deliberated and handed down its decision in the following

manner:

The Tribunal considers that Respondent, in particular in its
rejoinder in paragraph 63, has addressed the issue of the lack of
payment by Gambrinus of the agreed sum to Polar as required by
the share transfer agreement.

However, the Tribunal considers the reference made by Respondent
in its opening submission to the failure by Claimant to comply with
the terms of Article 6.7 of the joint investors’ agreement, resulting,

according to Respondent, in Claimant's failure to achieve valid title
to the Fertinitro shares, is a new argument which, as such, was not
allowed under paragraph 13.9 of Procedural Order No. 1.

Under paragraph 13.10 of the same order, any supplement by the
parties of their written submission must be authorised by the
Tribunal.

Having considered Respondent’s request to be authorised to deal
with the described new argument, as well as Claimant’s objection
under its letter of March 14" 2014, the Tribunal has decided to
grant the Respondent the requested authorisation.

That is our decision. All this is on record. Both Claimant and
Respondent will be able, if they so wish, to deal with this new
argument tomorrow in their closing, and certainly in the further
steps of the proceeding, including post-hearing briefs.>"'

e. March 13, 2014 — Day 4

Having presented their closing arguments, the Parties mutually agreed on the procedure by
which the JIA Defense would be dealt with.2”

The Chairman of the Tribunal addressed the Parties on the procedural steps with regard to
closing statements and post-hearing submissions. He also invited the Parties to confer and
agree on issues. The Chairman also requested the Parties to agree to a Joint List of

Questions which the Parties wished to be addressed in the Award.

On March 18, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 which formally restated
the agreement reached by the Parties at the end of the hearing. The relevant parts of the

Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 2 read as follows:

WRITTEN SUBMSSIONS ON THE “NEW ARGUMENT”

By Friday, 16 May 2014, Respondent shall file a written submission
of maximum twenty (20) pages, accompanied by nothing more than
a legal opinion, on the question of the validity under Venezuelan law
of the purported share transfer of 24 January 2008. The legal

opinion shall be brief, but need not be restricted to the twenty-page
limitation.

By Friday, 18 July 2014, Claimant shall file a written submission of
the same length (i.e. 20 pages), addressing Respondent’s submission
of 16 May 2014, as identified above. Claimant’s submission may
also be accompanied by a brief legal opinion and nothing more.

POST-HEARING BRIEFS

On Friday, 29 August 2014, the Parties shall file simultaneous
post-hearing briefs, of no more than fifty (50) pages.

By no later than Friday, 26 September 2014, the Parties shall file
simultaneous post-hearing reply briefs of no more than thirty (30)
pages.

With the post-hearing reply briefs, the Parties will submit an agreed

upon list of questions that they consider shall be addressed by the

Tribunal for purposes of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention.
On October 1, 2014, and pursuant to the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 2, the Parties
submitted the Joint List of Questions that should be addressed by the Tribunal for purposes
of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention. There were 16 questions to be addressed.”*

The issue that arises for the Committee to consider is whether Gambrinus through its
counsel having agreed on the procedure for the new point to be raised, can now contend
that they were “ambushed” and that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule

of procedure.

The chronology of events clearly indicates that the Applicant agreed consensually to the
procedure by which the JIA Defense was to be addressed by the Tribunal. It is therefore
the Committee’s view that there is no basis for the Applicant to characterise the procedure

they agreed as one in which they were “ambushed.”

The Committee is also of the view that Gambrinus was accorded ample opportunity to

address the JIA Defense. There were legal opinions submitted by Dr. Garcia Montoya on

28 Joint List of Questions (A-59).

behalf of Venezuela. Gambrinus submitted the legal opinion of Mr. Rodner which was 45

pages together with 56 exhibits.

Given the Committee’s prior findings that Gambrinus consented without any qualification
to the procedure to present its arguments to address the JIA Defense and that such
procedure provided ample opportunity to address it, in the Committee’s view, there is in

the circumstances no serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.

Another one of the arguments raised by Gambrinus is that the JIA Defense was raised very
late in the day and hence the Tribunal could have already commenced its deliberations.
This is mere speculation on the part of Gambrinus as there is no evidence to support that
the Tribunal had, prior to issuing its Procedural Order No. 2, in any way, deliberated on
the JIA Defense. The Committee is of the view that if Gambrinus was of the view that it
needed more time, then it should not have agreed to the timetable and the procedure that
was proposed and should have objected. The proceedings indicate that Gambrinus did not
register any such objection but had actually reached a consensus with Venezuela as to how
to deal with the JIA Defense. The Tribunal was cognisant of the fact that the Respondent
had raised a new argument and gave Gambrinus an opportunity to present its arguments to

the contrary.

The Committee is also of the view that the procedure that was agreed to by the Parties, as
enshrined in the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 2, does not in any way violate
fundamental rules of procedure. The Applicant was given every opportunity to present its
case as to why it had complied with the provisions of Section 6.7 of the JIA. The conduct
of the Tribunal in permitting a new argument to be raised with the consent of both Parties

is not a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.

The Applicant has also argued that the Tribunal wrongly permitted the introduction of IAS
7 and therefore committed a breach of the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 2 and this
constituted an annullable error within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d). The Tribunal did
not rely on IAS 7 in order to reach its conclusion on whether the cash equivalency
requirement was complied with. There is therefore, in the Committee’s view, no breach of

Article 52(1)(d) by the Tribunal in respect of this allegation.

65

263. The Committee relies on the words of the annulment committee in MINE v Guinea which

reads as follows:

A first comment on this provision concerns the term “serious”. In
order to constitute a ground for annulment the departure from a
“fundamental rule of procedure” must be serious. The Committee

iders that this blishes both q itative and qualitative
criteria; the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive
a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to
provide.

A second comment concerns the term “fundamental”: even a
serious departure from a rule of procedure will not give rise to
annulment, unless that rule is “fundamental”. The Committee
considers that a clear example of such a fundamental rule is to be
found in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International
Commercial Arbitration which provides: “The parties shall be
treated with equality and each party shall be given full opportunity
of presenting his case.”" The term “fundamental rule of procedure”
is not to be understood as necessarily including all of the Arbitration
Rules adopted by the Centre.*

264. The statement of the annulment committee in Wena Hotels is also relevant.

In order to be a “serious” departure from a fundamental rule of
procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the
Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would
have awarded had such a rule been observed."
265. The Committee is of the view that there is no merit in the Applicant’s contention that there
was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d) of the

ICSID Convention.

COMMITTEE’S DECISION

Pursuant to Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, Chapter VI of the ICSID Convention,
including Article 61(2), shall apply mutatis mutandis to the proceedings before this
Committee. According to Rule 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, “(t]he provisions of
these Rules shall apply mutatis mutandis to any procedure relating to the interpretation,

revision or annulment of an award and to the decision of the Tribunal or Committee.”
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how
and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members

67

271.

274.

275.

of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre shall be paid. ...

In exercise of its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee

has the authority to decide on an appropriate allocation of costs in the present proceedings.

Rule 47(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that the tribunal’s award “shall contain

[..-] @ any decision [...] regarding the cost of the proceeding.”

Regulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations further

provides that in annulment proceedings:

[...] the applicant shall be solely responsible for making the

advance payments requested by the Secretary-General to cover

expenses following the constitution of the Committee, and without

prejudice to the right of the Committee in accordance with Article

52(4) of the Convention to decide how and by whom expenses

incurred in connection with the annulment proceeding shall be paid.
The Applicant in seeking annulment of the Award, has been responsible for making all the
advance payments to cover the costs of the Committee and the Centre. The Committee has
discretion to decide on the final allocation of these costs of the proceeding, as well as of
the costs incurred by the Parties in respect of their legal representation in this annulment

proceeding.

The Respondent requests that the Committee order the Applicant to bear the costs of the
proceedings as well as the Respondent’s legal costs and expenses in full based on the

following arguments:

e the annulment proceedings were unnecessary and there were no merits in the
Applicant’s claims; and

¢ there was a misuse of the annulment proceedings.

The Committee cannot agree with the Respondent that Gambrinus’ Application for
Annulment was unnecessary. The ICSID Convention explicitly provides for the right to
seek annulment. The Committee is not convinced that there is any illegitimacy in the

Applicant’s motives to seek annulment in the present case.

68

276. The Committee in the exercise of its discretion sees no justification for ordering the
Applicant to bear the legal costs and expenses that the Respondent has incurred in

connection with this annulment proceedings.”

277. The Committee agrees with the recent trend in ICSID cases that it is generally reasonable
for a party whose application has been rejected in its entirety to bear the costs of the
proceeding in full. There are no special circumstances that would warrant a different
conclusion in the present case. The Committee is of the view that the Applicant shall bear
all costs of the proceeding, consisting of the fees and expenses of the members of the

Committee and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre.

278. The costs of the annulment proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee,

ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):

Committee Members’ fees and expenses

Tan Sri Dato’ Cecil W.M. Abraham 93,006.17

ICSID’s administrative fees 64,000.00
Direct expenses (estimated)?”” 46,348.67
Total 347,620,967

279. The Applicant has advanced the entire amount of the costs of the proceeding pursuant to
Regulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations and hence no

reimbursement order is required.

invoices are received and the account is final.
