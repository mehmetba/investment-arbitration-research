FACTUAL BACKGROUND

In May 2000, the Claimant (then known as Vannessa Ventures Ltd.) acquired Industrias
Infinito S.A. (“Industrias Infinito’). ‘4 Industrias Infinito held an exploration permit for
the Crucitas area which had been granted in 1993,'5 the term of which had been
extended to 18 September 1999. '® One of Industrias Infinito’s predecessor companies
had submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”), which had been approved
on 1 October 1993 by the Interdisciplinary Evaluation and Control Commission for
Environmental Impact Studies (“CONEIA”) — competent body before National
Technical Environmental Secretariat (“SETENA”) was created. 1”

CWS-Rauguth 1, 1] 12, 63.

As discussed in the Decision on Jurisdiction, this exploration permit had been obtained by the
company Vientos de Abangares, S.A., and then transferred to Placer Dome de Costa Rica, S.A.,
which was Industrias Infinito’s previous name under other owners. See Decision on Jurisdiction,

In 1997, President Figueres and the Minister of the Environment issued a decree that
declared mining to be an industry of national convenience. '®

Between 1993 and 2000, Industrias Infinito performed drilling and studies to prove the
existence and extent of the gold deposit. This included a pre-feasibility study in 1996,'9
which was accompanied by several reports and reviews on the viability of the Project;2°
other studies and reports addressing the environmental and socio-economic impact of
the Project;?" and a feasibility study in 1999 that proved the existence of a substantial
gold deposit in the Las Crucitas area.??

In December 1999, Industrias Infinito submitted the feasibility study to the Directorate
of Geology and Mines (“DGM”’) and requested an exploitation concession to developa
surface gold mine at Las Crucitas.25

Between 2000 and 2001, Industrias Infinito continued the exploration work and
obtained an updated resource estimate. 24

On 7 June 2001, the DGM approved the feasibility study, including the socio-economic
and environmental impacts of the Project.25

On 17 December 2001, Industrias Infinito obtained its exploitation concession, with a
ten-year term subject to extensions and one renewal, allowing it to extract, process and
sell the minerals fromthe Las Crucitas gold deposit. 2° The concession became effective

challenge before the Ministry of Environment and Energy (“MINAE”), requesting the
revocation of the 2002 Concession, alleging that it was against the national interest and
endangered the constitutional right to a healthy and ecologically balanced
environment.°° Due to similar challenges pending before the Supreme Court, the
MINAE deferred its decision on this challenge.

On 1 April 2002, environmental activists Carlos and Diana Murillo filed an amparo
petition (a constitutional challenge) against the resolution that granted the 2002
Concession on environmental grounds (the “Murillo Amparo’”).*"

On 8 May 2002, Mr. Abel Pacheco took office as President of Costa Rica. On 5 June
2002, President Pacheco declared an indefinite moratorium on open-pit mining (the
“2002 Moratorium’).*? It is undisputed that the 2002 Moratorium operated
prospectively and did not affect acquired rights.°5

On 12 August 2002, another mining concession holder, Rio Minerales S.A., filed an
amparo petition against the 2002 Moratorium, arguing that it violated the principles of
legality, judicial certainty and non-retroactivity, as well as its vested rights and those of
Industrias Infinito. On 20 August 2002, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme
Court declared that the 2002 Moratorium did not violate the petitioner’s rights and was
not retroactive in light of its grandfathering provision (“2002 Constitutional Chamber

Decision’).* In its findings, the Constitutional Court expressly stated that the same
applied to Industrias Infinito, as follows:°5

[NJo fundamental right has been violated - at least not in a direct manne-
by the enactment of the Executive Decree No. 30477-MINAE of June 5th
of this year. While it is true that through this decree the Executive declares

a national moratorium on open-pit gold mining in the national territory for
an undefined term (article 1), it is also true that in Transitional provision 1

it expressly establishes that all ‘[...] rights acquired before the publication
of this decree will be respected’, therefore the objections made by the
appellant lack[] substance. That means this decree [does not] violate
rights acquired or [ ] juridical situations [established] in favor of [the]
companies that [currently] carry out the activity subject to the
indefinite moratorium, as the decree expressively provides for their
protection. Eventually, a violation may result from its application, but
that [has not] happened either. The threats to the fundamental rights that
the appellant claims are no more than mere subjective fears. The fact that
both the President of the Republic and the Minister of the Environment and
Energy have made certain statements to the media, according to which, in
the opinion of the appellant, [they] will indemnify the companies Rio
Minerales S.A. and Industrias Infinito S.A., holders of the exploitation
concessions in the National Mining Registry of the Directorate of Geology
and Mines, presents no threat to the companies’ fundamental rights since
they merely are informal declarations without any action on behalf of the
Executive Power to stop these companies from the exploitation of the
granted concessions. The threat must be real and imminent, meaning that
there must be concrete acts by the administration that threaten a
fundamental right, which is not the case here. On the contrary, the text of
the disputed decree itself shows respect for the acquired rights of
these companies, and as a result there has been no violation of its
fundamental rights. In consequence, the present appeal is rejected, as is
declared in effect.

On 10 March 2003, Industrias Infinito filed an amparo petition requesting the
Constitutional Chamber to compel the SETENA to issue its decision on its EIA, which
it had requested in March 2002. 3°

The next day, on 11 March 2003, the SETENA denied approval of the EIA, on the
grounds that it required a declaration by the Executive that the Project was in the
national interest, which was lacking, and that the request showed certain technical
deficiencies.2” However, it did not disclose the reports which had served as the basis
for its conclusions. As a result, on that same day, Industrias Infinito appealed this
decision before the MINAE.%8 The MINAE agreed with Industrias Infinito, and, on

20 October 2003, ordered the SETENA to conduct a new evaluation of Industrias
Infinito’s application.*°

On 21 April 2003, Industrias Infinito filed a second amparo petition with the
Constitutional Chamber against the SETENA for violation of due process, requesting
disclosure of the reports.4° The Constitutional Chamber agreed with Industrias Infinito
and, on 25 August 2004, it compelled the SETENA to provide copies of any interna
and external assessments of the EIA.41

On 26 November 2004, the Constitutional Chamber ruled on the Murillo Amparo (the
“2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision’). It held that the 2002 Concession violated
Article 50 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to a healthy and ecologically
balanced environment, because that concession was granted prior to the approval of
the EIA. Specifically, the Constitutional Chamber held that, given the definition of the
EIA in the Mining Code, and in line with the preventive/precautionary principle, 4 “it is
clear that the Environmental Impact Assessment is necessary to obtain the exploitation
concession.” 43 The Constitutional Chamber noted that the preventive (precautionary)
principle in environmental matters had been incorporated into the constitutional regime
through a judgment of 21 December 2001, and was reinforced by Article 34 of the
Mining Code and Article 9 of the Regulation of the Mining Code. It also found that the
Government had not previously consulted the communities that might be affected by
the concession.*° The Constitutional Chamber thus held that the grant of the 2002
Concession had violated the preventive/precautionary principle and the constitutional
right to a healthy and balanced environment.“ It thus annulled the 2002 Concession,
“todo sin perjuicio de lo que determine el estudio de impacto ambiental,”4’ which the
Respondent translates as “without prejudice to what the environmental impact
assessment may determine,”“° while the Claimant's translation is “without prejudice to

the findings of the Environmental Impact Assessment.”49 The Tribunal finds that the
Respondent's translation is more accurate.

On 12 December 2005, the SETENA approved Industrias Infinito’s EIA. 5°
In May 2006, President Oscar Arias took office.

On 4 December 2006, Industrias Infinito requested the Constitutional Chamber to
clarify whether the annulment of the 2002 Concession had been “absolute” or “relative”,
in which case it would be subject to cure (saneamiento).5' On 7 June 2007, the
Constitutional Chamber concluded that this request was a matter of administrative law
and that it had no jurisdiction to opine on it.52 Specifically, the Constitutional Chamber
stated:

L.- If the respondent [...] considers that the violation indicated by the
Chamber in [the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision] has been
corrected, which nullifies [the 2002 Concession] because the requirements
of conducting the public hearing and the Environmental Impact Study (EIS)
approved, according to him, onDecember 12, 2005 by the [SETENA] have
been fulfilled, that is a matter that should be brought by using the
corresponding administrative and jurisdictional processes since the
subsequent fulfillment of the requirements whose omission led to the
declaration of admissibility of the appeal of legal protection (recurso de
amparo) filed on April 1, 2002 has no incapacitating effect on the decision
but it is rather the effect or consequence of its fulfillment. As a
consequence, the motion filed is unfounded and should be declared as
such.

IL- As for determining the nature of the annulment —whether absolute or
relative—of [the 2002 Concession] [...] these are aspects related to the
validity of the administrative decree elements whose content and
transcendence may not and must not be discussed or determined by this
appeal as it constitutes a matter of administrative nature that exceeds the
competence of this Court. However, the petitioner should keep in mind that
the annulment [of the 2002 Concession] set in [the 2004 Constitutional
Chamber Decision], is not because defects were detected in the
administrative decree itself which, as it was stated, may only be declared
by the competent administrative authorities or before a common judge, but
because the Chamber determined that the decree was infringing the
precautionary principle and constitutional right for the enjoyment of a
healthy and balanced environment, as contemplated in the Political
Constitution. The possibility of restoring the concession or the
impossibility of doing so by virtue of being an absolute or relative
nullity, is not part of the object of the writ of amparo, but rather is an
issue that must be determined in the administrative area or in
ordinary jurisdiction. The decision on the amparo whose clarification is
requested has one singular and specific effect and objective, without being

PDF, English) provided by the Claimant translates it as: “without prejudice to that concluded by
the Environmental Impact Assessment.”

able to rule upon what decisions or actions based upon the resolution the
Administration must adopt after the decision. The decision resolving the
amparo, in accordance with its factual records and applicable legal rules,
[does not] contemplate the determination of the absolute or relative nature
of the errors or omissions contained in the concession; that determination
is not within the jurisdiction of this court, since the possibility of correcting
or rectifying a defect of legal transgression, or the impossibility of doing so,
is an issue that must be resolved in compliance with the definitions and
limits contained in ordinary legislation. The nature of these procedural
defects, when applying the traditional terminology in relation to relative or
absolute errors, is that they are conceptual categories whose application
corresponds to the processes developed before the ordinary. jurisdiction.
For this reason, this motion is to be rejected in every respect.

On 31 October 2007, the MINAE granted Mr. Pacheco’s 2002 challenge against
Industrias Infinito’s 2002 Concession, on the basis of the Constitutional Chamber’s
2004 finding that the 2002 Concession violated Article 50 of the Constitution.5+

On 1 January 2008, the new Code of Contentious Administrative Procedure, entered
into force.55 This Code allowed individuals with diffuse intereststo challenge the legality
of administrative acts before the Contentious Administrative Tribunal (“TCA”).

On 4 February 2008, the SETENA approved arevised EIA. 5°

On 18 March 2008, President Arias issued a decree repealing the 2002 Moratorium,
which entered into force on 4 June 2008.5”

On 21 April 2008, President Arias and the MINAE granted Industrias Infinito an
exploitation concession (the “2008 Concession’ or the “Concession”), using the
administrative law concept of “conversion” (i.e., the previous annulled concession is
converted into a valid one). 58 Industrias Infinitohad requested that its 2002 Concession
be cured through the concept of saneamiento, but the Government deemed that it was
more appropriate to convert it.5° It is undisputed that a conversion does not reinstate
the original concession (as would be the case with a saneamiento), but creates anew
concession. ®

On 13 October 2008, President Arias designated the Crucitas Project as one of national
interest.*

On 17 October 2008, the National System of Areas Conservation (the “SINAC”)&
authorized the logging of trees on the land of the Crucitas Project.® Industrias Infinito
commenced logging that same day. ®

On 19 October 2008, the NGO UNOVIDA filed an amparo petition against Industrias
Infinito’s 2008 Concession based on the violation of Article 50 of the Constitution.®
The NGO FECON filed a similar amparo petition on 23 October 2008.

On 20 October 2008, the Constitutional Chamber issued a temporary injunction
suspending the forest-clearing operations, the execution of the Crucitas Project, and
the implementation of the decree declaring the Projectin the national interest. 6”

In November 2008, Mr. Jorge Lobo and APREFLOFAS filed challenges before the TCA
requesting the annulment of various administrative acts, including (i) the SETENA
resolution declaring the environmental viability of the Project; (ii) the SETENA
resolution approving the modification of the Crucitas Project; (iii) the MINAE resolution
granting the 2008 Concession; and (iv) the Executive Decree declaring the Project in
the national interest.®° The petitioners also requested the TCA to order Industrias
Infinito and Costa Rica to restore the site and provide compensation for environmenta
damage. ®

decision that was 279 pages long and after reviewing extensive evidence, the
Constitutional Chamber held that the Crucitas Project (and thereby the 2008
Concession and the other administrative acts cited in the preceding paragraph) did not
violate the petitioners’ constitutional right to a healthy environment.”' The Parties
dispute whether the Constitutional Chamber made findings of the underlying legality of
these administrative acts.’* The decision only refersto the 2002 Moratoriumas a matter
of fact and does not address the Moratorium’s impact on the Crucitas Project.7?

Also on 16 April 2010, the TCA issued its own temporary injunction preventing the
Crucitas Project from moving forward.”

On 29 April 2010, President Arias issued a decree declaring a new moratorium on
open-pit gold mining (understoodas the exploration, exploitation and processing of gold
using cyanide or mercury in the work to recover the mineral), which entered into force
on 11 May 2010 (the “Arias Moratorium Decree’). ’5

On 8 May 2010, President Chinchilla took office and issued a decree which essentially
restated the Arias Moratorium Decree (the “Chinchilla Moratorium Decree,” together
with the Arias Moratorium Decree, referred to as the “2010 Moratoria” or “2010
Executive Moratoria’). It also declared an indefinite moratorium on open-pit gold
mining, understood as mining activities using cyanide and mercury in the processing of
ore.’® The Chinchilla Moratorium Decree entered into force on 11 May 2010. However,
on 27 July 2010, President Chinchilla issued a letter acknowledging the 2010
Constitutional Chamber Decision and the possibility of Government liability if the 2008
Concession was cancelled.””

Meanwhile, on 11 June 2010, environmental activists Carlos and Douglas Murillo filed
an amparo petition with the Constitutional Chamber on the basis that Industrias
Infinito’s Concession was in breach of the 2002 Moratorium.’® The Constitutiond
Chamber denied this petition on 24 August 2010, on the grounds that it lacked
jurisdiction to review the legality of the exploitation concession (including its conversion)

and that of the related administrative acts.’° Specifically, the Constitutional Chamber
stated:®°

Although this Court finds that, indeed, on 20 May 2008 (the date when the
resolution R-217-2008-MINAE [approving the 2008 Concession] was
issued) Executive Decree number 30477-MINAE (issued on 12 June 2002,
repealed on 4 June 2008) [i.e. the 2002 Moratorium] was still in force, and
that the Decree stated that acquired rights would be respected, [] [the
assessment and analysis of] whether a mining concession violates
an executive decree [is not a matter of constitutionality but of
legality]. [...]

[A]lthough this Court verifies that the aforementioned Constitutional Court
resolution revoked Resolution R-578-2001-MINAE which granted the
mining concession to the company in question [the 2002 Concession], and
that the respondents interpreted such annulment as a relative annulment
[and that therefore] the ‘conversion of an administrative act’ figure under
Article 164 of the General Law of Public Administration was admissible,
[the assessment of] whether the respondents proceeded
appropriately when they ‘converted’ the [grant of the] mining
concession [ ] that had previously been annulled by [this]
Constitutional Court [is not a matter of constitutionality but of
legality].

On 24 November 2010, the TCA issued an oral summary of its decision on the
annulment request filed by Mr. Lobos and APREFLOFAS, declaring that all requests
for annulment had been upheld (the “2010 TCA Decision’).*' The TCA issued its full
written decision on 14 December 2010, ® where, inter alia, it dismissed the res judicata
defense raised by Industrias Infinito and the Government, ® and annulled Industrias

basis for this annulment was that, when the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision
annulled the 2002 Concession, that annulment qualified as an absolute nullity and thus
invalidated Industrias Infinito’s rights ab initio. As a result, there was no concession in
existence that could be “converted” into anew one. Accordingly, when the Government
granted Industrias Infinito the 2008 Concession, this was necessarily a new
concession, which thus violated the 2002 Moratorium, then in force.®° The TCA also
found that the Concession’s conversion had violated the principle of non-derogability
of rules (“principio de inderogabilidad singular de la norma”), pursuant to which the
Government may not override a general rule through a specific act.8° Further, as
discussed infra in Section V.C (discussing the Respondent's objection of illegality), the
TCA also declared that the 2008 Concession had other legal and technical flaws, and
held that Industrias Infinito had engaged in “fraude de ley.”°”

The TCA ordered inter alia: (i) the MINAE to cancel the 2008 Concession; ® (ii)
Industrias Infinito and the Government to facilitate the restoration of the site, with the
quantum of damages to be determined in a different TCA proceeding; ®9 and (iii) the file
to be transmitted to the prosecutor to determine whether criminal proceedings should
be initiated against Government officials (including President Arias).°°

In December 2010, the Costa Rican legislature enacted an amendment to the Mining
Code prohibiting open pit mining, which came into force on 10 February 2011 (the “2011

reserves to “cooperatives of workers for the development of mining in asmall scale for
the subsistence of families, artisanal mining and prospector use (coligallero) from
communities surrounding the exploitation sites, based on the amount of affiliates of
such cooperatives.” 9 It explicitly added a new provision to the Mining Code stating that
“[p]ermits or concessions shall not be granted for the exploration and exploitation
activities of open-pit mining of metallic minerals on national territory,” and “established
as an exception that only exploration permits for scientific and investigatory purposes
shall be granted.” 94

On 18 January 2011, Industrias Infinito filed a request for cassation of the 2010 TCA
Decision before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court, which had the
effect of staying the challenged decision.®

On 10 February 2011, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban entered into force. °

Constitutional Chamber's earlier decisions, in particular the 2010 Constitutiond
Chamber Decision.°”

On 30 November 2011, the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court denied
Industrias Infinito’s cassation request, and upheld the main conclusions of the 2010
TCA Decision (the “2011 Administrative Chamber Decision”).% In particular, it
upheld the TCA’s decisions on res judicata, non-derogability of rules, nullity of the 2002

states that itwas 11 February 2011 (C-CM Jur., J] 128, citing CWS-Hernandez 1, {| 201). In the
Tribunal’s view, the record suggests that the correct date is 10 February 2011: the Amendment
to the Mining Code (Exh. C-0238) states that it becomes effective on the date of its publication,
and the date of publication appears to have been 10 February 2011. In any event, this
discrepancy has no impact on the Parties’ arguments.

On Q January 2012, the Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Telecommunications
(‘MINAET”) canceled Industrias Infinito’s 2008 Concession (the “2012 MINAET
Resolution’).'°' The resolution stated in its operative part: 1°2

By virtue of the foregoing, in due compliance with the decision in
accordance with Articles 156 section 1 and 158 of the Contentious
Administrative Procedural Code, we hereby declare the cancellation of the
mining exploitation concession granted to the company Industrias Infinito
S.A., granted by Executive Branch resolution No. R-217-2008-MINAE at

On 12 April 2012, APREFLOFAS and Mr. Jorge Lobo Segura requested the TCA to
enforce the 2010 TCA Decision’ and, specifically, to order Industrias Infinito, SINAC,
and the State to repair the environmental damage caused to the site. 1

On 30 April 2012, a panel of four experts was appointed to assess the quantum of the
environmental damages and any reparation measures. ' This panel issued its expert
opinion on 8 June 2012, which estimated the environmental damages at
USD 6.4 million and recommended certain reparation measures to be implemented. 1°°

Industrias Infinito left the Crucitas site on 10 September 2015. 18

On 24 November 2015, on the basis of the expert report mentioned above, the TCA
ordered Industrias Infinito, the SINAC and the State to pay USD 6.4 million for
environmental damages within six months (the “2015 TCA Damages Decision’). °°

Upon appeals from the SINAC and the State, on 6 December 2017, the Administrative
Chamber of the Supreme Court overturned the 2015 TCA Damages Decision for lack
of motivation and remanded the file to the TCA (“2017 Administrative Chamber
Decision’). "'° More specifically, the Administrative Chamber held that the TCA did not
assess the experts’ report on environmental damages, did not make any reference to
the parties’ positions and did not justify the rate which it applied to determine the
amount of the damages. 11

On 14 January 2019, the TCAinvited the parties to the proceedings forthe enforcement
of the 2010 TCA Decision to comment on the 2017 Administrative Chamber Decision

resolve their dispute through a conciliation process. "3

On 22 January 2019, Industrias Infinito filed a brief with the TCA alleging that the
Crucitas area had suffered additional environmental damage since the 2015 TCA
Damages Decision due to a hurricane and third parties’ illegal mining activities. 14

proceeding, the TCA remitted the file to the conciliation office of the TCA. 15 According

SCOPE OF THIS DECISION

As agreed by the Parties and reflectedin Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1, these
proceedings have been bifurcated between jurisdiction and merits.

In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal dismissed all of the Respondents
preliminary objections (whether they went to jurisdiction or admissibility), with the
exception of the following, which were deferred to the present phase:

a. Whether the Claimant's investment complies with Article I(g) of the BIT (more
specifically, whether itis an investment made in accordance with Costa Rican law).
This objection was first raised by APREFLOFAS, but was subsequently endorsed
by the Respondent in its Counter-Memorial. 1"”

b. Whether the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis because the claims are
time-barred under the three-year statute of limitations contained in Article XII(3)(c)
of the BIT. In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal also deferred to the merits
phase the discussion whether this objection goes to jurisdiction or admissibility,
should it become relevant. 1'8

c. Whether the Claimant can invoke the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause
provided in Article IV of the BIT to “circumvent” the jurisdictional flaws in its case.
In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal noted that this objection only remained
relevant with respect to the time bar objection. As the Claimant invokes the MFN
clause on an alternative basis, the Tribunal will address the MFN argument only if
it upholds this latter objection. 119

Further, in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal held that the application of Section
IlI(1) of Annex | of the BIT was a matter of merits, not jurisdiction.'2° As the Tribuna
explained in that Decision, this provision “does not relate to the State’s consent to
arbitrate, nor to whether a claim can be heard or not; it relates to whether a particular
measure has or has not breached the BIT.” 21 The Tribunal will deal with this provision
at the end of the merits review, if it finds that any of the claims on the merits are founded.

JURISDICTION / ADMISSIBILITY

Law APPLICABLE TO JURISDICTION

As was noted in the Decision on Jurisdiction, it is undisputed that (i) jurisdiction is
governed by Article 25 of the |CSID Convention and by the BIT;’? (ii) the interpretation
of the ICSID Convention and the BIT is governed by the customary international law
principles on treaty interpretation as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties of 23 May 1969 (“VCLT”); ‘2° and (iii) the Tribunal has the power to rule on its
own jurisdiction. 124

OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

The Respondent’s Position
The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the following grounds:

a. The Tribunallacks jurisdiction ratione materiae and ratione voluntatis, because the
Claimant’s investment was not owned or controlled in accordance with Costa
Rica’s laws as required by Article I(g) of the BIT. While the Respondent does not
dispute that the Claimant has made an investment in Costa Rica, it argues that the
2008 Concession was obtained by fraud and misrepresentation, was grossly
defective under Costa Rican law and may have been procured by corruption. 125

b. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis, because the claims are time-
barred pursuant to the three-year limitation period imposed by Article XII(3)(c) of
the BIT. This is because the Claimant acquired knowledge of the alleged breach
and of the damage it caused when the 2010 TCA Decision was issued on
24 November 2010, i.e., prior to the cut-off date of 6 February 2011.126

c. Should the Tribunal find that the claims are barred under Article XII(3)(c), the
Claimant cannot invoke the MFN clause to attempt to circumvent this finding by
relying on a more favorable temporal limitation provision in another treaty. The
Claimant has failed to show how it has suffered from less favorable treatment, and
Article XII of the BIT contains jurisdictional requirements that cannot be bypassed
by operation of the MFN clause. The BIT’s MFN clause does not explicitly

encompass dispute resolution, but the majority view is that MFN clauses do not
apply to dispute settlement. '2”

The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Respondent's jurisdictional objections are meritless:

a.

With respect to the objections ratione materiae and voluntatis, the Claimant
submits that its investment falls within the scope of Article I(g) of the BIT, because
(i) it was valid at the time it was acquired, which is the relevant time to determine
legality; (ii) any breaches of Costa Rican law were not sufficiently serious to deprive
the Tribunal of jurisdiction, and are in any event primarily attributable to the State
itself; (iii) the Respondent is estopped from arguing illegality of measures issued
by its own officials; and (iv) there is no evidence whatsoever of corruption.128

In connection with the Respondent's objection ratione temporis, the evidence
shows that the Claimant knew, and could only have known, that the Respondent
breached the BIT and that Infinito had suffered damages on 30 November 2011,
ie., the date on which the Administrative Chamber annulled the resolutions
restoring the Claimant’s exploitation concession and other key permits, and on
which the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban for the first time made it impossible for the
Claimant to apply for another updated exploitation concession. '79

Finally, even if the Tribunal were to find that the claims are time-barred under
Article XII(3)(c), the Claimant submits that Article |V(a) of the BIT (which includes
an MFN clause) permits it to benefit from more favorable dispute resolution
mechanisms under the Respondent's bilateral investment treaties with Taiwan and
the Republic of Korea that contain no temporal limitations. 19°

DOES THE CLAIMANT OWN OR CONTROL AN INVESTMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH COSTA
RICAN Law?

The Respondent’s Position

During the jurisdictional phase, the Respondent's position was that the evidence was
insufficient to argue that “the entirety of Infinito’s investment was procured through
fraud, corruption or other malfeasance.”'3' However, in its Counter-Memorial, it alleged
that “fresh evidence suggesting that the Concession was indeed procured by corruption
has come to light since the Hearing on Jurisdiction. Having previously reserved its rights

138

in respect of this issue, Costa Rica now exercises those rights and objects to the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal on this basis.” 192

The Respondent's position during this phase has been that the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction over the Claimant’s entire case because the Claimant's 2008 Concession
was not owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rican law, as required under
Article I(g) of the BIT. The Respondent thus argues that the Claimant’s investment falls
outside the scope of the BIT’s protection and Costa Rica’s consent to arbitration.
Consequently, the Tribunal would lack jurisdiction ratione materiae and _ratione
voluntatis. 133

The Respondent's argumentis essentially the following: Article I(g) of the BIT expressly
requires that the investment be owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rican
law (a). The Claimant did not own or control an investment in accordance with Costa
Rican law (b).

a. Article I(g) of the BIT Requires that the Investment Be Owned or
Controlled in Accordance with Costa Rican Law

As noted in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the BIT expressly requires that investments
must be “owned or controlled” in accordance with Costa Rican law. '*4 The Respondent
submits that “[i]t is uncontroversial and well established in investment law that where a
treaty contains a provision requiring investments to be in accordance with a host-
State’s laws, investments which are illegal under that law are not protected by the BIT
and fall outside the scope of the State’s consentto arbitration.” 195 Relying on Anderson,
the Respondent further submits that, if an investment is not owned or controlled in
accordance with Costa Rican law, it will not qualify as an investment under the BIT.13¢

The consequences are three-fold. First, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione matenae,
because the substantive protections of the BIT apply only to investments as defined
under the BIT.'37 Second, it also lacks jurisdiction ratione voluntatis, because Costa
Rica’s consentto arbitration under the BIT applies only to “investors” who own or control

in “investment” as defined under the BIT. 18 Third, the investment falls outside the

Respondent’s consent to ICSID arbitration, since the latter only applies to a legal
dispute arising out of an investment. 199

Again relying on Anderson, the Respondent submits that the test for compliance with
this requirement is an objective one, i.e., “[e]Jach Claimant must meet this requirement,
regardless of his or her knowledge of the law or his or her intention to follow the law.”14°

The Respondent points out that, unlike similar requirements under other treaties, the
temporal scope of the legality requirement under Article I(g) of the BIT is not limited to
the establishment phase of the investment. The terms “owned” or “controlled” do not
relate to a particular point in time (as opposed to the terms “made”, “established” or
“admitted”). 41 Consequently, the legality requirement applies throughout the life of an
investment. ‘42 The Respondent relies on the wording of Article I(g) of the BIT and
denies that Vannessa Ventures and Copper Mesa support the Claimant's position. 43

Costa Rica further submits that the illegality arose in any event at the time of the
establishment of the investment in April 2008, marked by the granting of the 2008
Concession and related approvals. #4 Hence, even if the legality were to be assessed
at the establishment phase, the assessment would have to be made when the 2008
Concession and related approvals were granted. ‘45

The Respondent further contends that the illegality of the 2008 Concession invalidates
the protection of the Claimant’s investment, because each stage of an investment's
establishment must be legal and bone fide to qualify for protection underaBIT. '° Citing
to Chevron, the Respondent notes that the commercial reality of many large-scale
natural resource exploitation projects is that they are usually made in stages. '4” The
multi-phase nature of a mining investment has been acknowledged by various
investment tribunals, such as Bear Creek Mining.'4® With reference to Yukos, the
Respondent concludes that if an illegality of a sufficiently serious nature is identified at

any stage of the investment, this will render the investmentillegal. ‘4° Thus, in order for
the Claimant's investment to qualify for protection, the 2008 Concession and its later
operation must be legal.

In the Respondent's submission, under Article I(g) of the BIT, the Tribunal will lack
jurisdiction if the following two elements are met. First, the alleged illegality must be
sufficiently serious for the investment to lose the protections under the BIT and/or
access to dispute settlement under the BIT. 15° As was held in Quiborax, the subject-
matter scope of the legality requirementis limited to non-trivial violations of the State’s
legal order, violations of the State’s foreign investment regime, and fraud aimed at
securing the investment. >! Second, the respondent State must not have knowingly
overlooked or accepted the illegality, such that it is estopped from arguing that the
investment is illegal. '5* The factors that are relevant in this assessment include the
length of the time the State tolerated the illegal action without any intervention, and
whether the investor concealed its actions fromthe State, in which case the latter would
not be estopped. 1%?

b. The Claimant Did Not Own or Control an Investmentin Accordance with
Costa Rican Law

The Respondent argues that the Claimant did not own or control an investment in
accordance with Costa Rican law because (i) the Claimant obtained its investment
through deceitful conduct (“fraude de ley’); (ii) the Claimant’s 2008 Concession suffered
from other irredeemable legal defects; and (iii) there are indicia that the Claimant's
investment was procured through corruption.

(i) The Clai Obtained Its In Through Deceitful Conduct
(“Fraude de Ley”)

 

According to the Respondent, as declared by the 2010 TCA Decision and confirmed by
the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2008 Concession was illegally obtained
through misrepresentation to Costa Rican officials, which amounted to a legal fraud
(fraude de ley) under Costa Rican law. 54 Relying on its legal expert, Dr. Leon, the
Respondent submits that a “fraude de ley’ occurs “when acts are carried out under the
guise of lawful conduct, but are aimed at obtaining unlawful effects.” 155

The Respondent points out that the 2010 TCA Decision identified the following
instances of legal fraud: (i) the fact that Industrias Infinito interpreted the exploration
permit as automatically granting it an exploitation concession; (ii) the application of the
conversion of the administrative act to an act that had been annulled ab initio by a
Costa Rican court six years before; and (iii) the fact that Industrias Infinito requested a
modification of the environmental viability instead of filing anew EIA. '¢ In addition, the
Claimant attempted to circumvent certain environmental protections when submitting
its application for the 2002 and 2008 Concessions, by failing to inform the
environmental authorities that it planned to create a tailings pond over a public road. 15”
The Claimant also illegally attempted to amend its mining Project to allow itself to
extract minerals froma depth beyond the limit set by the DGM. "5°

Relying on Hamester, Inceysa, and Plama, the Respondent submits that, where an
investment is obtained through misrepresentation or fraud, it cannot benefit from the
protection afforded by the BIT and falls outside the scope of the respondent State’s
consent to arbitration. 159

The Respondent denies that it is estopped from asserting illegality, because, if at all, a
State is only estopped from raising an illegality objection where its acceptance of the
illegality gives rise to a legitimate expectation that the investment was legal. '®° While
the Respondent acknowledges that SETENA approved the relevant changes to the
Claimant’s Concession in February 2008, it notes that the approval was challenged
only seven months later and was eventually annulled through the 2010 TCA
Decision.

(ii) The 2008 Concession Suffered from Other Irredeemable Legal
Defects

The Respondent contends that the 2008 Concession suffered from other irreparable
deficiencies which rendered it null and void under Costa Rican law. The Respondent
explains that the 2008 Concession suffered from at least the following fundamenta
legal defects: 162

a. The grant of the 2008 Concession was illegal due to the application of the 2002
Moratorium. The attempt to apply the principle of conversion to the concession

previously held by Industrias Infinito was invalid because such concession had
been annulled and declared void ab initio more than six years before."

b. The grant of the 2008 Concession breached the principle of non-derogability of
general administrative regulations by individual, specific administrative acts. 1°

c. The 2008 Concession and related approvals breached numerous environmental
protection laws, in particular:

i. |The changes introduced by Industrias Infinito to the Project in December 2007,
after obtaining approval of its EIA in December 2005, were significant, and
would have required an additional EIA to have been carried out. 1

ii. The mandatory technical analysis of Industrias Infinito’s proposed changes to
the mining Project in December 2007 were not carried out. 166

SETENA’s approval of Industrias Infinito’s modified EIA in February 2008 was
invalid because it was based on the original EIA approval of December 2005,
which had a validity of two years and thus expired in December 2007.'”

iv. SETENA failed to hold a public hearing for the Project in accordance with the
requirements of the Organic Law of the Environment, which imposes on the
State an obligation to encourage public participation when actions could affect
the environment. 1

v. _ Industrias Infinito’s land-use permit was invalid, because it failed to consider
that the area in question included protected species of tree; it incorrectly
identified the species of tree in the area and it depended on the declaration of
national interest in relation to the Project, which the TCA declared void. 1°

vi. The permit for change in land use was invalid, since it was based on the 2008
Concession that was declared void. '7°

vii. When providing its approval for the modified EIA requested by Industrias
Infinito in December 2007, SETENA did not carry out the required cost-benefit
analysis under Costa Rican law. 17

viii. When applying for the EIA approval in 2002, Industrias Infinito failed to
disclose the existence of a public road in the area where the tailings pond for
the mine was planned to be built. It did so again when applying for
modifications to the Project in December 2007. ‘72

ix. SETENA relied upon certain reports provided by Industrias Infinito that were
not duly signed and stamped by the chemical engineer from the Professiona
Association of Chemical Engineers. ‘73

d. The decree that the Project was in the national interest was invalid, both in terms
of procedure and motivation. 74

For the Respondent, these defects, which were identified by the TCA and confirmed by
the Costa Rican Supreme Court, do not constitute minor, technical flaws but rather
demonstrate that the Claimant's investment was fundamentally invalid. Hence, they are
sufficiently serious to make the Claimant’s alleged investment ineligible for the
protection of the BIT.

Nor is the Respondent estopped from arguing that the Claimant's investment was illegal
as a result of these deficiencies. Although the TCA held that Costa Rican authorities
shared responsibility for the legal defects, Costa Rica’s judiciary found that the 2008
Concession had been illegally granted and invalidated it. Relying on the actions taken
by Costa Rica’s judiciary as well as the commencement of criminal and disciplinary
proceedings against certain Costa Rican officials involved in illegally granting the 2008
Concession, the Respondent asserts that it did not accept the defects in the Claimant’s
investment. 175

With respectto the responsibility forthe defects and the Claimant's arguments that they
were attributable to the Costa Rican authorities, the Respondent submits that the
reference to SPP is inapposite. While that tribunal held that the complicity of the
Egyptian authorities in the alleged illegality defeated the respondent's objection, the
extract cited by the Claimant makes no mention of the seriousness of the illegality, and
is thus irrelevant. 17

As to the Claimant’s assertion that there is no evidence of deceitful conduct, the
Respondent argues that the Claimant rehashes the arguments that it had
unsuccessfully raised before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court,
ignoring the Costa Rican Court's findings, in the “hope that this Tribunal will act as a

court of appeal in respect of domestic law decisions.”'”” The Claimant's attempt to
persuade the Tribunal to question the findings of the Costa Rican courts ignores a
consistent line of authorities that recognize that tribunals should give due deference to
the decisions of domestic courts regarding the application of their own law. The
Respondent relies in particular on Chevron, and on Cortec, according to which a
tribunal should “accept the findings of local courts” as long as there are no gross
deficiencies.178

The TCA made its findings, continues the Respondent, following a comprehensive
review of the evidence and a lengthy hearing, including testimony from numerous
witnesses and experts proffered by Industrias Infinito, which the Administrative
Chamber found in compliance with due process.

Regarding the Claimant’s allegation that Costa Rica relies on ex post facto declarations
of invalidity that are based on laws that changed after the Claimant made its investment,
the Respondent alleges that the two declarations cited by the Claimant were in force
when the 2008 Concession was granted. ‘7

The Respondent further denies that the support for the Claimant’s mining project
expressed by its officials now estops it from pleading illegality. That support did not
amount to a representation that the 2008 Concession was exempt fromjudicial scrutiny.
In any event, the estoppel doctrine does not mean that statements or acts of the
executive can supersede court decisions, the judiciary being the ultimate arbiter of
Costa Rican law pursuant to Costa Rica’s Constitution.

In addition, Costa Rica stresses that the cases on which the Claimant relies in support
of its estoppel argument, such as Kardassopoulos and ADC, were solely concerned
with endorsements by the executive branch of a State and did not involve any contrary
ruling fromthe judiciary. They are thus distinguishable. Moreover, Costa Rica considers
that it cannot be estopped fromasserting illegality where the Claimant itself fraudulently
concealed the illegality, arule that was confirmed in Fraport! and in Arif. Finally, for the
Respondent, the issue of estoppel does not arise in respect of investments that,
because of their nature and associated risks, may be made subject to special
regulations, such as investments in open-pit mining. 18°

(iii) | There Are Indicia that the Claimant’s Investment Was Procured
Through Corruption

In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent asserted that there were indicia that the
Claimant’s investment was procured through corruption. In particular, itnoted that there
were ongoing criminal investigations in respect of the Claimant’s investment, and thus
it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction over the dispute. 18"

However, in its Rejoinder, the Respondent expressly withdrew this objection:

[Thhe investigation of possible bribery resulting from the donation by the
Claimant's shareholder Ronald Mannix to former President Mr Arias’
foundation has been discontinued following the decision of the Costa Rican
Criminal Court that specific charges against Mr Arias (but not others) were
time-barred. Accordingly, Costa Rica is no longer pursuing its jurisdictional
objection on the basis of the indicia of corruption in respect of the
Claimant's investment.

The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant maintains that its investments fall within the scope of Article I(g) of the
BIT for the reasons set out below.

a. The Assessment of Legality of an Investment Focuses on the Time When
the Investment Was Acquired

The Claimant submits that the Respondent bears the burden of proving that the
Claimant breached the legality requirement under Article I(g) of the BIT. The applicable
standard of proof for assertions of illegality, fraud and corruption requires clear and
convincing evidence. 18

Referring to Fraport!, the Claimant submits that the legality must be assessed at the
time when the investment was acquired, as “the effective operation of the BIT regime
would appear to require that jurisdictional compliance be limited to the initiation of the
investment.” 84 The Claimant also cites Vannessa Ventures, where the tribunal found
that “the jurisdictional significance of the ‘legality requirement’ in the definition of a
investment [...] is exhausted once the investment has been made.”'® The Claimant
further points out that, in Copper Mesa, the tribunal held that “the wording of the Treaty
is confined, at most, to a jurisdictional bar applying to the time when the Claimant first
made its investment,” and “does not extend to the subsequent operation, management

or conduct of an investment.” '8 According to that tribunal, requiring the legality
standard to be met throughout the life of an investment would have serious and
undesirable consequences. 187

b. There Was No Illegality at the Time Infinito Initially Acquired Its
Investment

It is the Claimant's contention that its investment was legal when it was initially made
in 2000. Since there was no illegality associated with the Claimant’s acquisition of
Industrias Infinito in 2000, the Claimant submits that the Respondent is trying to argue
that Industrias Infinito’s exploitation concession was actually acquired in 2008.18
However, the Claimant argues, Industrias Infinito’s 2008 Concession is the same
investment as its 2002 Concession, which meets the legality requirement under Article
I(g) because there were no legal defects when it was first acquired in 2001, which Costa
Rica admitted at the hearing on jurisdiction. For that reason alone, this jurisdiction
challenge should be dismissed. "8°

As explained by Ms. Araya, Industrias Infinito’s right to an exploitation concession
crystallized once it had proven the existence of an exploitable deposit while an
exploration permit holder. The resolutions issued in 2001 and 2008 with respect to the
concession are part of the same investment. 19°

Moreover, the Claimant observes that the Respondent relies on the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision to argue that the 2002 and 2008 exploitation
concession resolutions are different instruments and that Industrias Infinito never
owned a valid mining concession under Costa Rican law. The Claimant submits that
this argument should be rejected fortwo reasons. First, its investments in Costa Rica
are not limited to the resolutions granting the exploitation concession; as at the time the
Claimant acquired Industrias Infinito, Industrias Infinito held an exploration permit
granting a right under the Mining Code to obtain an exploitation concession and that
right was not unlawful. Second, the argumentis based on ex post facto declarations of
invalidity by the Constitutional Chamber in 2004 and by the Administrative Chamber in
2011, based on laws that changed after the investment was made.'9! The Claimant
refers to Arif, in which the tribunal held that the State’s use of a declaration by its own
judiciary of the illegality of the claimant’s investment under its law was formalistic in that
it relied on a judicially declared invalidity that applied retrospectively to the date of the
investment. 192

c. Any Subsequent Illegality Cannot Deprive the Tribunal of Jurisdiction

The Claimant submits that, even if the Tribunal were to consider events that post-date
the investment to assess its jurisdiction, any breaches of Costa Rican law that occurred
during the life of the Crucitas Project were not sufficiently serious to warrant the Tribunal
declining jurisdiction. In any event, the vast majority of the illegalities identified by the
TCA, on which Costa Rica relies, were attributable to the State itself and not to Infinito
or Industrias Infinito. As a result, they cannot deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction (i).195
The Claimant adds that, in any event, the Respondent is estopped from arguing that
the resolution granting the exploitation concession and related approvals were illegal
(ii). Finally, the Claimant maintains that there is no evidence of corruption (iii).

(i) The Breaches of Costa Rican Law Alleged by the Respondent Do
Not Meet the Illegality Standard

The Claimant submits that, to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction, any breaches of Costa
Rican law must be serious and attributable to the Claimant. This principle is well-
established in international law and was acknowledged by the Tribunal in its Decision
on Jurisdiction. Cases of illegality have resulted in an investor being deprived of treaty
protections only in the event of corruption or forgery, fraudulent misrepresentation, and
serious breaches of the host State’s law. 1%4

According to the Claimant, this standard is not met here. There was no deceitful
conduct by Industrias Infinito, and the remaining issues identified by the TCA would not
have prevented the Project from proceeding.

The basis for the Respondent's argument of deceitful conduct are the TCA’s findings
that Industrias Infinito committed fraude de ley. Fraude de ley is a civil and
administrative law concept in Costa Rica, not a criminal law one.'% According to the
Claimant, none of the TCA’s findings of fraude de ley amount to deceitful conduct by
Industrias Infinito:

a. The TCA first found that Industrias Infinito’s interpretation of its rights under the
Mining Code as automatically granting it the right to an exploitation concession
“insult[ed] the intelligence of this Court, violates the law, and results in a process
of fraudulent abuse of law.” 19° For the Claimant, “a legal interpretation, shared by
all relevant Costa Rican authorities over a number of years, cannot possibly be

as fraude de ley, but the Respondent and its expert, Sra. Leén, have done so. C-Reply Merits,

construed as fraud or an intent to deceive at all, let alone one which is sufficiently
serious to warrant depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction.”19”

b. The second finding characterized as fraude de ley was based on the fact that the
Administration used the mechanism of conversion to restore the exploitation
concession in an attempt to avoid the 2002 Moratorium. That mechanism was
chosen by President Arias and Minister Dobles on the advice of the MINAE, even
though Industrias Infinito had requested a different mechanism, i.e. convalidation.
According to the Claimant, “[t]his cannot possibly be construedas deceitful conduct
on the part of [Industrias Infinito], or even deceitful conduct at all.” 19°

c. The third finding of fraude de ley was linked to the fact that, in its modified EIA,
Industrias Infinito stated that the extraction depth of the mine was meters below
the surface, rather than meters above sea level. For the Claimant, there is no
evidence that Industrias Infinito had any intentto deceive or mislead SETENA. Had
SETENA required the information stated in a different form to properly assess it, it
could have requested that information. SETENA found no adverse impacts and
approved the modifications, following which Industrias Infinito presented the
revision to its feasibility study to the DGM, with the increased extraction depth. In
2010, the Constitutional Chamber held that SETENA’s approval of the EIA
modification had been compliant with Costa Rica’s constitutional guarantee of a
clean and healthy environment. °°

The TCA also found that Industrias Infinito did not inform authorities of its intent to
create a tailings pond in the location of a public road. According to the Claimant, there
was no basis for this finding, as the road was clearly identified in all Project drawings,
as were mitigation measures. °°

In any event, so says the Claimant, the Administrative Chamber did not uphold the
TCA’s findings of “fraude de ley’ or other allegedly deceitful conduct, and instead ruled
on the narrower grounds that the 2002 Moratorium applied to the Crucitas Project. 20"

As to the remaining “irredeemable legal defects” allegedly identified by the TCA, the
Claimant contends that none would have prevented Industrias Infinito from proceeding
with the Crucitas Project and obtaining a new resolution granting it an exploitation
concession, had it not been barred by the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. Moreover, these

205

legal defects were (with limited exceptions) attributable to the State itself.2°2 They
included actions by President Arias and Minister Dobles, i.e. the issuance of the 2008
resolution granting Industrias Infinito’s exploitation concession and the alleged failure
to hold a public hearing, to conduct a sufficient cost-benefit analysis, and to allow the
clearance of a larger area of forest than had been permitted by SETENA;*°3 severd
actions of SETENA, namely the decision not to require a full EIA to be completed in
respect of the project modifications, the supposed failure to conduct sufficient analysis
of the EIA modification proposal, the decision not to require a public hearing in respect
of the EIA modifications, and the alleged failure to carry out a sufficient cost-benefit
analysis, and SINAC’s supposed failure to take into account that the area contained
protected species of tree.204

Infinito further contends that these legal defects were not sufficiently serious to justify
depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction. Mere technical defects do not meet the illegality
standard, particularly where they are the result of the ex post facto application by the
courts of laws that changed after the investment was made. The same applies to
Industrias Infinito’s alleged failure to disclose the existence of apublic road, and reports
relied on by SETENA that were not signed and stamped by a chemical engineer from
the Professional Association of Chemical Engineers.2°

(ii) Costa Rica is Estopped from Arguing that the Resolution
ing the Exploitation C jonand Approvals Was

 

9
Illegal

In any event, the Claimant submits that, given its conduct during the relevant time, the
Respondent is estopped from arguing that the resolution granting the exploitation
concession and related approvals was illegal. From 2001 onwards, the Claimant,
Industrias Infinito and the Government all proceeded on the understanding that the
exploitation concession and related approvals were valid. This remained true following
the enactment of the 2002 Moratorium and the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision.
Costa Rican officials and courts repeatedly concluded over a decade that the 2002
Moratorium did not apply to the Project. The doctrine of estoppel bars the Respondent
from now claiming that purported technical and legal errors by Costa Rican officias
should deprive the Claimant of the BIT’s protection. In support, the Claimant relies on
Desert Line, ADC, and Arif.29°

(iii) | There ls No Evidence of Corruption

Finally, it is the Claimant's case that there is no evidence whatsoever of corruption.
Specifically, there is no evidence that a donation was made by a principal investor in
Infinito to the Fundacion Arias Para La Paz.

The Claimant notes that the Tribunal had previously indicated that there was insufficient
evidence to make out this claim. As new evidence, Costa Rica has invoked the
reopening of the investigation against President Arias regarding this alleged donation,
which is no proof of corruption. The Respondent and APREFLOFAS also point to
criminal charges against Costa Rican officials in connection with the Crucitas Project.
However, so says the Claimant, there have been no final convictions, except for the
one against Minister Dobles, for prevaricato, which was overturned on appeal.2°”

Analysis

The Respondent objects that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae and ratione
voluntatis over the entire dispute because the Concession was not owned or controlled
in accordance with Costa Rican law, as required under Article I(g) of the BIT.2°°

Article XII of the BIT, which contains Costa Rica’s offer of arbitration, refers to “[a]lny
dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party,
relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the former
Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss
or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach [...].”209

Accordingly, jurisdiction depends, inter alia, on the existence of a dispute between a

in Article I(h) as a natural person or an enterprise “who owns or controls an investment
made in the territory of the other Contracting Party.”2'° An investment, in turn, is defined
in Article I(g) of the BIT in the following words:2""

an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other

The Respondent submits that it is well established that, where a treaty contains a
legality requirement, as is the case here, investments which are illegal are not protected
and fall outside the scope of the State’s consent to arbitration.2'2 The Respondent thus
argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae, because the BIT applies
only to investments as defined under the BIT, i.e. investments that meet the legality
requirement. Similarly, it asserts that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione voluntatis,
because the Respondent’s consent to arbitration only covers “investors” and
“investments” as defined under the BIT, which again implies legality.2"5

Depending on the content of the treaty, illegality can affect jurisdiction, admissibility or
the merits of the claims. Here, the legality requirement forms part of the definition of
investment. Consequently, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that, to qualify as
a protected investment under the BIT, the Claimant's investment must be an asset
owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rica’s laws. If it is not, then the Tribuna
will lack jurisdiction. Indeed, the conditions for jurisdiction as defined under the BIT wil
not be fulfilled and, by the same token, the requirementfor consent under Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention will not be met.

As recorded in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Claimant asserts that it owns or controls
the following assets in the territory of Costa Rica: “(i) its shares in Industrias Infinito; (ii)
the money it invested in Industrias Infinito through intercompany loans; (iii) the
exploitation concession; (iv) the pre-existing mining rights underlying the exploitation
concession; (v) the other approvals for the Crucitas [P]roject; (vi) the physical assets
associated with the [P]roject, including the half-built mining infrastructure; and (vii) the
intangible assets associated with the [P]roject.”2"4 At the time, the Respondent did not
contest this.2‘* However, as APREFLOFAS had alleged that the investment had been
procured by corruption, the Tribunal deferred the matter to the merits.2'6

In the course of the merits phase, the Respondent objected that the investment had not
been made in accordance with Costa Rican law. This objection centers exclusively on
whether the Claimant owned or controlled the 2008 Concession (and related approvals)
in accordance with Costa Rican law. As noted above, the Respondent argues that
Industrias Infinito obtained the 2008 Concession and related approvals through
deceitful conduct, and that the 2008 Concession suffered from other irredeemable lega
defects.?1” Yet, under the terms of the Treaty, it is not on the 2008 Concession that the
Tribunal must focus for purposes of establishing its jurisdiction. The 2008 Concession
does not qualify as an investment of the Claimant under Article I(g) of the Treaty.
Indeed, it is not an “asset owned or controlled [...] directly” by the Claimant, as it is
owned or controlled by Industrias Infinito. In other words, itis an asset owned indirectly.
Yet, it does not fall within the scope of the Treaty’s definition, which requires an “asset
owned or controlled [...] indirectly through an enterprise or natural person of a third
State [...].”2'8 Industrias Infinito is an enterprise incorporated in the host State and thus
does not qualify as an enterprise of athird State. The same applies to the pre-existing
mining rights, other approvals for the Crucitas Project, and any physical or intangible
assets owned by Industrias Infinito and alleged to constitute Infinito’s investments.

In light of the Treaty’s text, the asset that qualifies as an investment for purposes of
establishing jurisdiction are the Claimant's shares in Industrias Infinito, which the
Claimant owns indirectly, through Crucitas (Barbados) Limited, a corporation
incorporated under the laws of Barbados, i.e., an enterprise of a third State.2'9 As a
result, the shares are the investment to which, according to the Treaty, the legality
requirement attaches. Seen in this light, the Claimant’s shares in Industrias Infinito are
far from being an “ancillary investment,” as the Respondent contends. To the contray,
it is the Claimant’s main investment, without which it would have no access to
jurisdiction under the Treaty.

The Respondent has not disputed that the Claimant owns or controls its shares in
Industrias Infinito in accordance with Costa Rican law. Nor has it argued that the
Claimant acquired these shares illegally, or that its ownership or control of these shares
has been vitiated in any way. As to the allegations of corruption, the record is clear that
they concerned “matters that happened after the initial investment was made.”22° On

passed into the ownership of its subsidiary at the relevant time, the Tribunal notes that, as
observed in /nmaris, for purposes of jurisdiction it need not examine whether each and every
element of an investment meets the requirements of the BIT and the ICSID Convention; it “need
only determine the existence of a covered investment in the transaction as a whole.” /nmaris

this basis, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent's allegations that the 2008
Concession and related approvals were acquired illegally or were affected by legal
flaws are irrelevant for purposes of jurisdiction.

There being no dispute that the Claimant has made an indirect investment in Costa
Rica (i.e., its shares in Industrias Infinito) in accordance with its laws, the Tribuna
rejects the Respondent's illegality objection. For reasons of procedural economy, it
finds it unnecessary to address the Parties’ conceptual disagreements as to the
temporal and subject matter scopes of the legality requirement found at Article I(g), or
their arguments on estoppel. This being said, as the corruption allegations made by
APREFLOFAS raise an issue of international public policy, which the Tribunal must
address ex officio, the Tribunal will review whether the acquisition of this investment
was tainted by corruption.

As noted above, both the Respondent and APREFLOFAS have alleged that there are
indicia that the Claimant's investment was procured through corruption,2*" and that
consequently, the Claimant's investment “falls outside both the scope of the BIT’s
protections and Costa Rica’s consent to arbitration.”2? The Respondent has since
withdrawn this objection, with the justification that “the investigation of possible bribery
resulting from the donation by the Claimant’s shareholder Ronald Mannix to former
President Arias’ foundation has been discontinued following the decision of the Costa
Rican Criminal Court that specific charges against Mr Arias (but not others) were time-
barred.” 223

In spite of this withdrawal, the Tribunal will address this corruption allegation for the
reasons mentioned above. First of all, the Tribunal notes that the allegations of
corruption by the Respondent and APREFLOFAS relate to the acquisition of the 2008
Concession, which was granted during President Arias’s administration.224 As the
Respondent admitted during the Hearing on Jurisdiction, the allegations of corruption
concern “matters that happened after the initial investment was made,”225 which the
Tribunal understands to mean that they do not relate to the Claimant’s acquisition of
shares in Industrias Infinito. Hence, even if the corruption allegations were well-
founded, quod non, this would not imply that the acquisition of the shares, which is the
relevant investment for present purposes, was unlawful. It would mean that later
conduct of the investor was tainted, which could be a defense on the merits, but not an
obstacle to jurisdiction.

In any event, there are insufficient signals in the record that the 2008 Concession was
obtained through corruption. In particular, APREFLOFAS and the Respondent were
relying on an investigation against former President Oscar Arias and other officials

involved in the granting of the Concession 26 that has been discontinued.22” While it
appears that the discontinuation decision was annulled and remanded to the first court
for a de novo assessment, ””8 there is no indication that the charges against President
Arias can proceed. Moreover, there is no element on record accrediting
APREFLOFAS'’s suggestion that the Arias foundation received a USD 200,000
donation fromone of the Claimant’s investors. When assessing the record and reaching
the findings just set out, the Tribunal has taken into consideration that it is notoriously
difficult to prove corruption and that, as a result, tribunals tend to focus on circumstantial
evidence, relying on indicia or red flags. Even adopting such less demanding standard
of proof, it cannot conclude that the 2008 Concession was procured by corruption. As
a consequence, it will not revert to this issue in the context of the merits, considering
that the inquiry would not be different on the merits and that it has discharged its ex
officio duty in matters of international public policy for purposes of jurisdiction and merits
here.

Therefore, the Tribunal denies the Respondent's illegality objection. It will consider the
Respondent’s arguments that the 2008 Concession suffered from legal defects or that
Industrias Infinito otherwise breached Costa Rican administrative or environmental law
when assessing the merits.

ARE THE CLAIMS TIME-BARRED UNDER ARTICLE XII(3)(c) OF THE BIT

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis as the
Claimant’s claims are time-barred, because the Claimant had actual or constructive
knowledge of (a) the alleged breaches and (b) the fact that it had incurred loss or
damage, before 6 February 2011.

a. The Claimant Had Actual or Constructive Knowledge of the Alleged
Breaches Prior to 6 February 2011

According to the Respondent, the evidence shows that the alleged breaches
crystallized before the cut-off date and that the Claimant acquired knowledge of such

breaches when the 2010 TCA Decision was issued on 24 November 2010, before the
cut-off date. 229

To identify when a breach crystallizes, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal should
apply the approach taken by other tribunals when analyzing whether a claim falls within
the temporal scope of a BIT.2°° More specifically, the Tribunal should assess whether
the distinct measures that are alleged to be in breach of the BIT were legally significant
and distinct events from measures that occurred prior to the cut-off date, or whether
the measures were deeply rooted in measures or events taking place before the cut-
off date and did not have any separate effect, or bring about any fundamental change
in relation to those earlier measures.?3' The Respondent relies on Spence, which found
that the investors had “failed to show [...] that the breaches that they allege are
independently actionable breaches, separable from the pre-entry into force conduct in
which they are deeply rooted.”2°? It further refersto case law that demonstrates that,
where a State’s overall conduct has affected an investor's rights and such conduct has
consisted of actions, some of which have occurred before the cut-off date and some
thereafter, the tribunal will not have jurisdiction over the acts post-dating the cut-off if
the relevant legal and factual situation had already crystallized before that date. 255 In
other words, aclaimant cannot invoke the last act in a chain or series of events, on the
ground that the breach crystallized then, if in reality that act was not a distinct and
legally significant event and brought about no separate effect or fundamental change
to the status quo ante.254

Here, the Respondent contends that the alleged breaches had already crystallized prior
to the cut-off date, because (i) the legal and factual situation underlying the Claimant's
complaints had already been shaped by events prior to 6 February 2011; and (ii) the
measures complained of had no separate effect on such legal and factual situation.
Instead, these simply maintained or confirmed the status quo ante.2°° Specifically, the
legal and factual situation regarding the Claimant's alleged investment had already
taken definite shape — and therefore crystallized — prior to 6 February 2011, as a
consequence of the following two events: (i) the 2010 TCA Decision (issued on 24

November 2010, which annulled the 2008 Concession and related project approvals);
and (ii) the 2010 Executive Moratoria (which became effective as of 11 May 2010, and
banned open-pit mining in Costa Rica).2°° Indeed, it was the 2010 TCA Decision, as
opposed to the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which ordered the annulment
of the 2008 Concession. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision did nothing other
than confirm the legality of the 2010 TCA Decision — no effects or specific orders were
altered.297 Likewise, it was the 2010 Executive Moratoria that banned open-pit mining
in Costa Rica. The legal and factual situation underlying the Claimant's complaint in
relation to the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban had thus already crystallized prior to the
cut-off date. 7°

By contrast, the measures on which the Claimant predicates its BIT claims had no
separate effect on the status quo ante that had already been shaped by the previous
two measures (the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2010 Executive Moratoria). Essentially,
the first three of the measures invoked by the Claimant (the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision; the 2012 MINAET Resolution, and the 2013 Constitutiond
Chamber Decision) did nothing more than confirm or maintain the annulment of the
Concession, which had already occurred with the 2010 TCA Decision in November
2010, over two months before the cut-off date of 6 February 2011. The fourth measure
(the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban) replicated the prior 2010 Executive Moratoria. Hence,
the legal and factual situation on which the Claimant’s BIT claims are based had already
crystallized with the prior 2010 Executive Moratoria and the 2010 TCA Decision.239 As
a result, such measures do not constitute distinct and legally significant events, and
cannot form an independent or free-standing basis for Claimant's BIT claims.24°

More specifically, the Respondent contends that the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision was not a distinct and legally significant event that was independently
actionable under the BIT“ for the following reasons:

a. First, it did nothing more than confirm the findings of the 2010 TCA Decision,
namely that the 2008 Concession should be annulled because it breached the
2002 Moratorium. 742

b. Second, evenif the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision had never been issued,
the Concession would have remained annulled (as a result of the 2010 TCA
Decision). The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision therefore had no separate
effect on the Claimant's investment from the 2010 TCA Decision. The Claimant
relies on the award in Rumelito argue that, where judicial measures are alleged to

breach a treaty, it is only the final appeal court judgment that crystallizes the
breach. However, the passage cited from that case has no bearing on the issue of
when a particular breach crystallizes. Furthermore, “as the tribunal’s decision in
ST-AD demonstrates, in instances in which a judicial appeal is decided after the
cut-off date, but the appeal and the resulting appellate judgment are deeply rooted
in a judgment rejecting the same arguments prior to the cut-off date, the resulting
appellate judgment will not constitute a distinct and legally significant event
capable of giving rise to a separately actionable breach.”*43 In the same vein, the
Respondent argues that “[t]he status of the 2008 Concession remained the same
both before and after the 2011 Administrative Chamber [Decision].”244

Third, the operative part of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision does not
refer to any annulment of the 2008 Concession. By contrast, the operative part of
the 2010 TCADecision expressly contains the decision to annul Industrias Infinito's
rights. 245

Fourth, many of the Claimant's arguments to show that the 2008 Concession is
valid were assessed solely by the TCA and not by the Administrative Chamber,
since the latter “exercised procedural economy.”246

Fifth, assuming that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision had upheld the
Claimant's appeal, this would not have automatically reinstated the 2008
Concession. Indeed, the issue would have been remanded to the TCA.24”

Sixth, the Claimant does not dispute that the 2010 TCA Decision annulled the 2008
Concession. Rather, the Claimant is arguing that the decision only “became firm’
with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.*4°

Seventh, the Claimant did not carry out any mining activities following the 2010
TCA Decision. The Respondent argues that this shows that the “2008 Concession
and related approvals had been annulled [...].”749

Similarly, the Respondent contends that the 2012 MINAET Resolution was not a

distin

ct and legally significant event that was independently actionable under the BIT

because its only purpose was to implement the express instruction contained in the

2010

TCA Decision to the Executive, such instruction being the legal and logical

consequence of the TCA having declared the 2008 Concession null and void. This

resolution therefore cannot form the basis of a separate breach of the BIT.25° As Dr.
Leén explains, “the annulment of aconcession and its cancellation [...] have the same
effect: the termination of the concession.”25' Further, the Respondentargues that the
Claimant and its witness have recognized that Industrias Infinito no longer had any
exploration permit or pre-existing mining rights since its exploration permit had expired
on 18 September 1999.52

Likewise, the Respondent argues that the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision was
nota distinct and legally significant event that was independently actionable under the
BIT. The Respondent recalls that, in that judgment, the Constitutional Chamber
determined that it could not rule on the constitutionality of the 2010 TCA Decision
because the Administrative Chamber had already rendered its decision. In any event,
the Respondent submits that “[a]ny ruling by the Constitutional Chamber on the
constitutionality of the 2010 TCA Judgment in any event would have had no effect at
all on the 2010 TCA Judgment’s findings in relation to the legality of the concession,
since such findings (which examined the legality, and not the constitutionality, of the
2008 Concession and related measures) would fall outside the competence of the
Constitutional Chamber.”253 In the alternative, the Respondent argues that the 2010
TCA Decision annulled the 2008 Concession on other grounds that were not part of the
Claimant’s res judicata defense. 254

Finally, the Respondent contends that the fourth measure (the 2011 Legislative Mining
Ban, which the Respondent refers to as the Legislative Moratorium) was also not a
distinct and legally significant event and cannot forman independent basis for a BIT
claim. The 2011 Legislative Mining Ban replicated the substance of the 2010 Executive
Moratoria that had been issued by the executive branch prior to the cut-off date, and
that had remained in full force and effect from the time of their enactment, and past the
cut-off date. The Claimant was therefore subject to precisely the same constraints both
before and after the cut-off date, which means a fortiorithat the 2011 Legislative Mining
Ban had no separate effects or impact than those generated earlier by the 2010
Executive Moratoria. In other words, the 2010 Executive Moratoria already prevented
the Claimant from applying for anew concession, which is the very grievance that the
Claimant now complains of in relation to the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. Thus, the
2011 Legislative Mining Ban did not fundamentally change or shape the legal and
factual situation that existed prior to 6 February 2011; it simply recast in legislative
terms a legal limitation that already existed by virtue of the 2010 Executive Moratoria25>

The Respondent further contends that the Claimant's position is contrary to its
contemporaneous understanding of the 2010 Executive Moratoria. The Respondent

submits that in its Quarterly Report of 30 September 2010, the Claimant stated that it
had registered impairment charges of USD 309,000 and USD 450,000 with respect to
its “properties impacted by the mining moratorium announced by the Costa Rican
Government on May 8 2010 [i.e., the date of the Chinchilla Moratorium Decree].”25°
Hence, the legal and factual situation on which the Claimant's BIT claims are based
had already crystallized with the prior 2010 Executive Moratoria and the 2010 TCA
Decision.25”

b. The Claimant Had Actual or Constructive Knowledge ofthe Loss or
Damage Caused Prior to the Cut-Off Date

The Respondent contends that the Claimant had actual or constructive knowledge of
the loss or damage it had suffered with the 2010 TCA Decision, i.e., before the cut-off
date.258 It denies that the relevant moment for the purposes of Article XII(3)(c) is the
momentat which the investor “[knows] its investment became ‘substantially worthless’,”
as suggested by the Claimant.259 Relying on various investment arbitration decisions,
the Respondent argues that “it is not necessary to show that the Claimant knew, or
ought to have known, the exact magnitude of the loss it suffered in order to determine
when it had knowledge of loss or damage for the purposes of a temporal limitation
provision.” 260

First, the Respondent argues that the loss objectively occurred before the cut-off date.
It notes that the Claimant’s share price dropped by more than 50% immediately
following the issuance of the 2010 TCA Decision,”©' and stresses that its quantum
expert found that “[f]rom a financial perspective, 24 November 2010 is the correct
valuation date as that is the date that activity stopped and the investment should have
been impaired on Infinito’s books.”262 The Respondent further argues that this loss
results directly from the annulment of the 2008 Concession by the 2010 TCA Decision,
and that the subsequent measures — the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the

2012 MINAET Resolution and the 2013 Constitutional Court Decision — did not cause
any additional loss or damage because they did not alter the 2010 TCA Decision.?®

The same conclusion applies with regard to the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. The
Respondent argues that this Ban had no “additional or different impact on the Claimant
beyond that which had already been caused by the 2010 Executive Moratoria’, which
had imposed a ban on open-pit mining before the cut-off date.764

Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimant acquired knowledge of the loss
before the cut-off date. In particular, the Claimant knew that the loss had been caused
by the 2010 TCA Decision.?65 According to the Respondent, the Claimant expressly
recognized that the 2010 TCA Decision had deprived it of the entire value of its
investment in its press release of 18 January 2011, whereby it stated that “[t]he
Company [i.e., the Claimant] is seeking to re-establish the security and value of its
considerable and long-term investments in Costa Rica and to reverse the negative
impact that the Ruling has had with respect to the Company’s share price and the
inherent negative impact on its investors and employees.”26° The Respondent also
points to Infinito’s reports, press releases and financial statements in which it
recognized the loss caused by the 2010 TCA Decision; to Mr. Rojas’s confirmation that
the Project was halted, and to Infinito’s decision to allow the BNP’s facility to lapse.26”
Indeed, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s investment was worthless even
before the 2010 TCA Decision, noting that various financial statements issued between
2008 and 2010 showed that Infinito’s finances were already deteriorating .768

The Respondent further contends that the Claimant did not contest that it had become
aware of the 2010 Executive Moratoria at the time that the relevant decrees were
promulgated (and in any event, prior to 6 February 2011). The Respondent infers from
this fact that the Claimant was aware of the loss or damage before the cut-off date
caused by the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, since the loss is the same. °°

The Respondent further contends that the Claimant's arguments based on merely
subjective beliefs and expectations, for instance that the Administrative Chamber would
overturn the 2010 TCA Decision, are irrelevant for the purposes of the objective test
required by Article XII(3)(c).2”°

c. Article lV of the BIT Does Not Permit Infinito to Bypass the Requirements
of Article XII(3)(c)

Finally, the Respondent denies that the MFN clause, contained in Article IV of the BIT,
permits the Claimant to bypass the requirements of Article XII(3)(c). More specifically,
it argues that Article IV does not permit the Claimant to import the more favorable
dispute resolution provisions in the Costa Rica-Taiwan and Costa Rica-Korea BITs,
which do not contain a provision such as Article XII(3)(c).27"

First, the Respondent argues that the BIT’s MFN clause is a substantive provision and
cannot be used to import provisions from other investment treaties entered into by the
Respondent.?’2 To be able to invoke that clause, the Claimant would need to show
affirmatively that the MFN obligation has not been met due to some action or omission
by the Respondent, which the Claimant has not done. 273

Second, the Respondent contends that Article |V(a) of the BIT does not encompass
dispute resolution. 274

Third, the Respondent submits that Article XIl of the BIT contains jurisdictiona
requirements (rather than admissibility requirements), and such requirements cannot
be bypassed by operation of the MFN clause.?75

The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that it filed its claim in accordance with the statute of limitations
provisions contained in the BIT. It argues that it first acquired knowledge of the
Respondent's breaches of the BIT and knowledge thatits investment in Costa Rica had
been rendered substantially worthless on 30 November 2011 (i.e. within the limitations
period). This was the date on which the Administrative Chamber released its decision
annulling the resolutions granting Industrias Infinito’s exploitation concession and other
key permits, and the date that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban for the first time made
it impossible for the Claimant to continue with the Crucitas Project.276

a. The Claimant First Knew that the Respondent Breached the BIT, and that
It Had Suffered Damages, on 30 November 2011

The Claimant maintains that it first knew that the Respondent breached the BIT and
that it suffered damages on 30 November 2011. The Claimant asserts that it did not
consider the 2010 TCA Decision to be final; instead it expected that it would be able to

continue to develop the Crucitas Project following the release of a favorable judgment
by the Administrative Chamber.2’”

First, according to the Claimant, the record shows that, after the TCA released its
Decision, the Claimant was “surprised and frustrated, but it had every expectation that
the Administrative Chamber would overturn the [2010 TCA Decision],” allowing the
Claimant to “finish building, and start operating, the Crucitas [P]roject.”2”° The Claimant
points to the following facts to support this allegation:

a. The Claimant and its independent auditor Ernst & Young did not record an
impairment charge in the Claimant’s audited financial statements regarding the
Claimant's mineral properties in Costa Rica after the release of the 2010 TCA
Decision. The Claimant's external auditors noted in a presentation that Claimant
would only have to consider impairment in the event of an adverse decision from
the Administrative Chamber. The Claimant further refers to (i) internal accounting
memoranda, explaining its reasoning for not recording an impairment charge; (ii)
internal emails, explaining its reasoning for not recording an impairment charge;
and (iii) public statements made by the Claimant's management under Canadian
securities laws, confirming their view that an impairment was not warranted. 279

b. The Claimant asserts that it anticipated resuming construction after the
Administrative Chamber overturned the 2010 TCA Decision, as demonstrated by
numerous internal communications. This same expectation is also reflected in the
securities filings. 28°

Second, the Claimant understood that it was the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision which had finally and irreversibly annulled the resolutions granting Industrias
Infinito’s key permits and rendered the Claimant's investment in Industrias Infinito
substantially worthless, 28" as shown by the following evidence:

a. Infinito recorded an impairment charge on the assets related to the Crucitas Project
following the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. As explained in an
accounting memorandum, Infinito did not consider that the Crucitas Project was
cancelled until the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. 782

b. The Claimant relies on Mr. Peschke’s witness statement in which he explains that
(i) he agreed with the impairment, as well as with the accounting memorandum,
and (ii) Infinito began to wind-down the Crucitas Project only after the 2011

Administrative Chamber Decision.28 For instance, Industrias Infinito undertook
massive employee layoffs at that time. 2°

c. Internal emails exchanged between 7 December 2011 and 10 January 2012 with
regard to the closure of the Project confirm the Claimant’s understanding that the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was the judicial measure that caused a
breach. 285

d. The Claimant's securities filings show that the Claimant was not considering its
investments in the Crucitas Project to be substantially worthless and, by contrast,
was expecting to carry on the Project, until the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision.?&

b. The Challenged Measures Are All Distinct Legal Measures with Distinct
Legal and Practical Effects

The Claimant denies that the challenged measures are deeply rooted in the 2010 TCA
Decision, as suggested by the Respondent.?8” By contrast, the Claimant contends that
the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, the 2012
MINAET Resolution and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision are distinct from
measures pre-dating the cut-off date and had separate legal and practical effects on
the Claimant’s investment in Costa Rica. 8°

First, the Claimant does not share the Respondent's view that the breaches crystallized
with the 2010 TCA Decision because the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision
merely upheld the annulment of the 2008 Concession and thus did not alter the
Claimant’s rights.28° Relying on the decisions in Rumeli, Apotex and Eli Lilly, the
Claimant submits that “a lower court decision does not trigger a limitation period if
appealed.”29° The Claimant argues that in the present case, the 2010 TCA Decision
was suspended during the appeal and was not implemented until the Administrative

Chamber had rendered its Decision in 2011, namely when the decision to cancel the
2008 Concession became firm and final.2°"

Second, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban is a separate measure from the 2010
Executive Moratoria, because (i) it supplanted the effects of the two prior moratorium
decrees, which were inferior legal instruments; (ii) it had broader and stronger effects
than those moratoria; and, (iii) the Claimant was only affected by the 2011 Legislative
Mining Ban when the Costa Rican courts annulled its mining rights so that it needed to
apply again to obtain new rights. 2°

Third, the Claimant argues that 2012 MINAET Resolution did not merely implement the
2010 TCA Decision, as alleged by the Respondent. According to the Claimant, (i) the
2012 MINAET Resolution did not implement the 2010 TCA Decision but the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision and (ii) it went further than merely implementing the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. The Claimant argues in this respect that the
2012 MINAET Resolution cancelled the 2008 Concession, the related approvals and
all of Industrias Infinito’s remaining procedural rights in the Crucitas area, including its
exploration permit and its pre-existing mining rights.2%°

Fourth, the Claimant contends that the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision is
independent from the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. Indeed, the Claimant
argues that it brought before the Constitutional Chamber an entirely new issue, namely
the existence within the Costa Rican judicial systems of various conflicting decisions.2%

Finally, the Claimant argues that the cases cited by the Respondent, Spence, Corona
and ST-AD provide no guidance for the present case.?°° According to the Claimant, the
tribunals in these cases found that they lacked jurisdiction either because (i) the breach
clearly occurred before the cut-off date; (ii) subsequent facts, such as the sending of a
letter or the filing of a motion for reconsideration, are not sufficient to constitute a
different breach than a measure that had occurred before the cut-off date; or (iii) the
breaches occurred before the entry in force of the applicable BIT.2°° The present case
is different because Industrias Infinito filed an appeal before the Supreme Court for
legitimate reasons and because that proceeding suspended the prior 2010 TCA
Decision.797

c. In Any Event, Article IV of the BIT Permits Infinito to Bypass the
Requirements of Article XII(3)(c)

The Claimant argues that, should the Tribunal find that the temporal condition in Article
XII(3)(c) of the BIT is not met, it should then conclude that Article XII(3) is not applicable
by operation of Article IV of the BIT (the MFN clause).2° The Claimant's position is that
Article IV of the BIT allows it to benefit from the more favorable dispute resolution
provisions in the Costa Rica-Taiwan and Costa Rica-Korea BITs, which do not contain
a provision such as Article XII(3)(c).299

The Claimant submits that the purpose of Article IVis to extend “treatment” with respect
to the “enjoyment, use, management, conduct, operation, expansion, and sale or other
disposition of an investment”, which includes more favorable provisions of other BITs,
including more favorable dispute resolution mechanisms. °°

In response to the Respondent's argument that temporal limitations cannot be
circumvented by the application of an MFN clause on the basis that they constitute
jurisdictional rather than admissibility requirements, the Claimant argues that Article
XII(3)(c) of the BIT sets out an admissibility requirement to submit a claim to arbitration.
The Respondent gave its unconditional consent to arbitrate under Article XII(5) of the
BIT. Therefore, the limitation period requirement in Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT is part of
the procedure which an investor must follow before it can invoke the consentto arbitrate
by a State party on the basis of the Treaty. 301

Analysis

Pursuant to Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT, an investor may submit a dispute to arbitration
only if “(c) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor
first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and
knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.” °°? In other words, aclaim is
barred if the Claimant had (actual or constructive) knowledge (i) of the alleged breach
and (ii) of the loss it caused, more than three years before the Request for Arbitration
was filed.

As stated in the Decision on Jurisdiction, to decide this objection “the Tribunal must
answer three questions: (i) first, it must identify the cut-off date for the three-year
limitation period; (ii) second, it must determine whether the Claimant knew or should
have known of the alleged breach or breaches before that cut-off date; and (iii) third, it

must determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known that it had incurred
loss or damage before that date.”°°9

The analysis deals first with the cut-off date (Section (a) infra), then with knowledge of
breach and loss (Section (b) infra).

a. Cut-Off Date

As discussed in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Request for Arbitration was filed on 6
February 2014. Hence, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over claims regarding which the
Claimant first acquired knowledge of the breach and loss more than three years earlier,
i.e. before 6 February 2011. The Parties agree with this cut-off date. 54

b. Knowledge of Breach and Loss

For the claims to be time-barred, Article XII(3)(c) requires the Claimant to have first
acquired both knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that it has incurred loss
or damage, prior to the cut-off date. The Tribunal notes that the BIT refers to knowledge
of the alleged breach, and not to knowledge of the facts that make up the alleged
breach. In other words, the limitations period only starts to run once the breach (as a
legal notion) has occurred. While a breach will necessarily have been caused by facts,
as discussed below, the moment at which a breach “occurs” will depend on whena fact
or group of facts is capable of triggering a violation of international law.

Although the Treaty does not expressly say so, the loss or damage must flow from the
alleged breach. This does not necessarily mean that the loss always postdates the
breach. Depending on the standard breached, breach and loss can coincide. This may
be the case for expropriation, where the breach will usually crystallize when the direct
taking or substantial deprivation occurs. This might also be the case for claims
grounded upon a breach of fair and equitable treatment, if the violation of legitimate
expectations or arbitrariness is perpetrated by way of an act that causes damage.
Hence, the Tribunal finds it more appropriate to address knowledge of breach and loss
jointly for each alleged breach.

When undertaking its analysis, the Tribunal must also bear in mind that the Treaty (i)
uses the conjunction “and”, so knowledge of breach and loss are cumulative
requirements; (ii) refers to “first” knowledge and not only knowledge; (iii) covers both
actual and constructive knowledge.

To establish when the Claimant first acquired actual or constructive knowledge of 2
alleged breach, the Tribunal must start by identifying when the alleged breach occurred.

The Claimant argues that the breaches of the Treaty occurred through five measures,
which post-date the cut-off date, and which it alleges had the following effects:

a. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision dated 30 November 2011 ,3° which
confirmed the 2010 TCA Decision and rendered final and irreversible the
annulment of the exploitation concession, environmental approvals, the declaration
of public interest and national convenience, and the land use change permit.

b. The 2011 Legislative Mining Ban on open-pit mining,3°° which entered into force
on 10 February 2011, and which prohibited Industrias Infinito from applying for new
permits.

c. The 2012 MINAET Resolution dated 9 January 2012,°°” which cancelled the 2008
Concession and expunged all of Industrias Infinito’s mining rights from the mining
registry, going further than what was ordered by the Administrative Chamber.

d. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision dated 19 June 2013,2°8 which declined
to resolve the conflict between its earlier decision upholding the constitutionality of
the Crucitas Project approvals and the 2010 TCA Decision.

e. The reinitiation of the TCA proceedings for environmental damage in January
2019.309

This being so, the Claimant does not allege that each of these measures was a
separate treaty breach. As recorded in the Decision on Jurisdiction and confirmed in
the Reply,°7° the Claimant argues that “[i]t is the combined operation of these four
measures [...] that meant that Industrias Infinito definitively could no longer pursue the
development of the Crucitas project.”3"'

Specifically, the Claimant submits that the combined result of the first four measures
breached the BIT in four ways:

a. It expropriated its investments by definitively precluding Infinito from building and
operating the Crucitas gold mine.*'2

b. It breached Costa Rica’s obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment (“FET”)
by violating Infinito’s legitimate expectations, treating Infinito arbitrarily and
inconsistently, and denying both procedural and substantive justice to Infinito.313

c. It failed to grant Infinito’s investments full protection and security (“FPS”).5"4

d. It breached two substantive obligations imported into the BIT through the BIT’s
MEN clause from other investment treaties entered into by Costa Rica: (i) the
obligation to do “what is necessary” to protect Infinito’s investments, imported from
the Costa Rica-France BIT, and (ii) the umbrella clause requiring the host State to
“comply with [or observe] any obligation assumed regarding investments of
investors of the other Contracting Party,” found in Costa Rica’s BITs with Taiwan
and Korea.315

As to the fifth measure, the Claimant argues that it is a continuation of Costa Rica’s
previous FET breach.3'® However, as is discussed in Section (vi) infra, it appears to
have a separate effect.

The formulation of the claims suggests that the Claimant relies on acomposite breach,
i.e., a breach by “a series of actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful.”3"”
While it only expressly refers to composite acts in a footnote,3"* the argument is that
the alleged breaches are the result of the combined effect of the various measures
cited above (with the possible exception referred to in Section (vi) infra). A composite
breach “occurs when the action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions
or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act.”3'9 Accordingly, were the
Tribunal to accept the Claimant’s composite breach argument, it would need to
determine the date on which the Claimant first acquired knowledge of the action in the
series which was sufficient to constitute the breach, and of the resulting loss.

However, the Respondent denies that the Claimant has properly pleaded a composite
breach. It states that “[t]he Claimant's few passing reference[s] in its Reply to
‘combined’ or ‘composite’ effect of those measures cannot be taken as a serious
attempt at raising — let alone proving — a creeping violation of the fair and equitable

treatment obligation under Article II(2)(a).”32° The Respondent also insists on the lack
of reference to the fact that a “breach of an international obligation by a State through
a series of actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful require that such
actions or omissions be ‘sufficiently numerous and inter-connected to amount not
merely to isolated incidents or exceptions but to a pattern or system.” 321

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the Claimant has not properly
substantiated its composite breach argument. The Claimant merely makes some
references to combined or composite effect. It makes no submissions on the effect of
a composite breach on the time bar requirement. Be this as it may, even if the Claimant
had properly pleaded a composite breach, the Tribunal can see no composite breach
in the measures impugned. The Commentary to ILC Article 15 makes it clear that, to
amount to a composite breach, the various acts must not separately amount to the
same breach as the composite act (although they could separately amount to different
breaches).%? It also clarifies that the breach cannot “occur” with the first of the acts in
the series.523 Here, each of the measures could arguably amount separately to the
same breach (an expropriation or a violation of FET), and the Claimant expressly
alleges that the breach occurred with what it considers to be the first act in the series,
namely, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.**4 The Tribunal will thus assess
the measures as simple breaches.

A simple breach is a breach by an “act of a State not having a continuing character.”
325 As the Commentary to ILC Article 14 explains, it “occurs at the moment when the
act is performed, even if its effects continue.”276 The Tribunal must thus determine the
pointin time in which an act is capable of constituting an international wrong. The cases
cited by the Respondent suggest that, where the State has taken a series of separate
measures that predate and post-date the cut-off date, tribunals have focused on the

ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Commentary to Article 15, 4 7, Exh. CL-0007 (“A
consequence of the character of a composite act is that the time when the act is accomplished
cannot be the time when the first action or omission of the series takes place. It is only
subsequently that the first action or omission will appear as having, as it were, inaugurated the
series. Only aftera series of actions or omissions takes place will the composite act berevealed,
not merely as a succession of isolated acts, but as a composite act, i.e. an act defined in
aggregate as wrongful.”)

The Tribunal notes that, chronologically, the first act in the series is the 2011 Legislative Mining
Ban, which entered into force on 10 February 2011; however, the Claimant has repeatedly
asserted that this measure only applied to it after the notification of the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision on 30 November 2011. See, e.g., C-Reply Merits, | 334.

event which gave rise to the breach and have refused to look at subsequent events that
are not legally significant or distinct. 52”

The Commentary to Article 14 provides further useful guidance. It states that “the
existence and duration of a breach of an international obligation depends for the most
part on the existence and content of the obligation and on the facts of the particular
breach [...].”528 It also notes that “[iJnternationally wrongful acts usually take some time
to happen,” the “critical distinction” being between a breach that is continuing and one
which has already been completed. As to “the moment when the act is performed”
(point in time in which a completed act “occurs”), the Commentary notes that the words
“at the moment’ were “intended to provide a more precise description of the time frane
when a completed wrongful act is performed, without requiring that the act necessarily
be completed in a single instant.” 929

The Commentary goes on to explain that “[w]hether a wrongful act is completed or has
a continuing character will depend both on the primary obligation and the
circumstances of the given case.” 33° For instance “[w]here an expropriation is carried
out by legal process, with the consequence that title to the property concerned is
transferred, the expropriation itself will then be acompleted act. The position with a de
facto, ‘creeping’ or disguised occupation, however, may well be different.”°9"

Significantly for present purposes, the Commentary to Article 14 addresses the
question of “when a breach of international law occurs, as distinct from being merely
apprehended or imminent.”352 It notes that this question “can only be answered by
reference to the particular primary rule,” noting that “where the internationally wrongful
act is the occurrence of some event — e.g. the diversion of an international river — mere
preparatory conduct is not necessarily wrongful”:3%°

Preparatory conduct does not itself amount to a breach if it does not

‘predetermine the final decision to be taken’. Whether that is so in any

given case will depend on the facts and on the content of the primary

obligation. There will be questions of judgement and degree, which it is not

possible to determine in advance by the use of any particular formula. The

various possibilities are intended to be covered by the use of the tem

‘occurs’ in paragraphs 1 and 3 of article 14.°*

On this basis, the Tribunal concludes that a simple act “occurs” when it has been
“performed” or “completed”; that the concept of “completion” relates to the point in time

at which the act is capable of constituting a breach, which depends on the content of
the primary obligation; and that a breach need not be completed in a single act.

Hence, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the first step in the analysis is to
identify when agiven act or omission was performed or completed. The second step is
to assess when the Claimant first knew of the completion of the action or omission and
of the loss caused thereby. This analysis must be conducted for each of the standards
allegedly breached (Sections (i) to (vi) infra). The analysis that follows is adopted by a
majority of the Tribunal even when this is not expressly so stated. Arbitrator Stern will
set out her views in her Separate Opinion on Jurisdiction and Merits.

(i) Expropriation

The Claimant contends that “the substantial deprivation of Infinito’s investments did not
occur until after and as a result of the combined application of both the [2011]
Administrative Chamber's [Decision and the 2011 [L]egislative [MJining [BJan.”3°5 The
Claimant argues in this respect that it learned about the breach when the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision was announced on 30 November 2011, because (i)
this is the first time that it knew that the annulment of the Concession was final and
irreversible; (ii) it was also the first time that it knew that the 2011 Legislative Mining
Ban would apply to it; and (iii) it was only after the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision that the MINAET could implement that annulment (which it did through the
2012 MINAET Resolution). The Claimant points out that the 2010 TCA Decision was
suspended while the recurso de casacién was in process.

By contrast, the Respondent argues that “it was the 2010 TCA Judgment and the legal
defects in the 2008 Concession described therein which rendered the 2008 Concession
invalid and development of the Crucitas Mining Project impossible.” According to the
Respondent, the Claimant first knew or should have known of the breach with the 2010
TCA Decision, because (i) this is the measure that declared the annulment of the
Concession and other rights; (ii) all of the challenged measures are deeply rooted in
the 2010 TCA Decision, and none of them were distinct and legally significant events;
and (iii) had the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision not been issued, Industrias
Infinito’s Concession would have remained annulled.

The majority of the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that an expropriation could only
have occurred with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. For an expropriation to
occur, the taking or substantial deprivation must be permanent, or at least not
ephemeral in nature. More specifically, a judicial expropriation cannot occur through a

C-Reply Merits, ] 692 (emphasis in original). See also C-Reply Merits, | 472 (‘There is [...]
overwhelming fact evidence that Infinito first knew, and only could have known, that the
resolutions granting IISA’s key approvals had been finally and irreversibly annulled, and that
Infinito’s investment in the Crucitas project had been rendered substantially worthless, on
November 30, 2011.”)

R-Rej. Merits, 672. As aresult, onthe merits of the expropriation claim, the Respondent argues
that the Claimant has failed to prove a causal link between the challenged measures and the
loss of its investment. R-Rej. Merits, Section IV.B.5.

decision by a first instance court, the execution of which is stayed pending an appeal,
because it lacks finality and enforceability. A judicial expropriation can only occur when
a final judgment is rendered or when the time limit to appeal has expired. Here, the
procedural framework of the relevant court action shows that the deprivation of the
Claimant's investment only became a permanent loss with the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision. Indeed, it is only with this judgment that the 2010 TCA Decision
became final (firme),3°” the casacién proceedings having suspensive effect over the
2010 TCA Decision. From a legal perspective, the expropriation occurred at the time
the suspension was lifted, that is, upon issuance of the cassation decision. To
paraphrase the Commentary to the ILC Articles, the legal process initiated by the 2010
TCA Decision was completed with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which
is when the expropriation became acompleted act.

That is notto say that an investor is required to exhaust local remedies before resorting
to arbitration as a requirement for the admissibility of the claim. The question hereis a
different one: itis whether the 2010 TCA Decision was sufficiently final and enforceable
to inflict harm on the Claimant and qualify as a breach as a matter of substance. Court
decisions are not final and enforceable if an appellate remedy with suspensive effect is
still available. The situation is generally different for administrative decisions, with the
result that, “an expropriation occurs at the moment of the decision of an administrative
authority and is not only completed with the final refusal to remedy the administrative
act.”338

The record further confirms that, while the 2010 TCA Decision may have initiated the
legal process whereby the 2008 Concession was annulled, that annulment did not
become definitive and the consequent loss of value to the Claimant’s investment did
not become permanent until the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision on 30
November 2011. First, the evidence shows that, although the 2010 TCA Decision did
cause the cessation of the works on the mine, 3°° the site was keptina state that allowed
the works to resume following a favorable outcome of the cassation remedy. In
particular:

a. The quarterly report dated 30 June 2011 stated that “the Company remains in a
position to restart construction activities within three to six months of a favorable
SALA | [i.e. Administrative Chamber] ruling, recalling its employees and
consultants and successfully obtaining project financing. No changes to the

b. On 26 November 2010, Industrias Infinito’s VP of Operations sent an email stating
that Industrias Infinito “will continue with an appeal with confidence we will win” and
“we will carry on with the project.” 541

c. It was only after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision that Industrias Infinito
laid off 223 of its 243 employees. *42

Second, the facts on record about the financial effects of the 2010 TCA Decision show
that the Claimant did not suffer a substantial deprivation of its investment (a
requirement for an indirect expropriation to occur) until the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision. One indicator is Infinito’s market capitalization: as the Claimant's
financial expert, FTI, explains, while the behavior of Infinito’s share price “is not a
reliable indication of the fair market value of the Project for the purposes of determining
damages,” it “is illustrative of the market's perception of the magnitude of the impact of
the alleged wrongful acts of the Respondent, and also provides an objective measure
on the timing of when Infinito’s investments in the Project became substantially
worthless.”*43 Here, it is true that the Claimant's market capitalization dropped about
50% after the issuance of the 2010 TCA Decision, from CAD 36 million to CAD 18
million on the day following the announcement of the 2010 TCA Decision (24 November
2010),544 and the Respondent's damages expert shows a drop to USD 15.4 million by
14 December 2010 (date on which the full decision was issued).545 In the Tribunal’s
view, a drop of 50% in value does not amount to a substantial deprivation. The fact that
Infinito’s market capitalization remained at approximately CAD 15.8 million in the period
between the two decisions, reaching a high of CAD 27 million on 11 November 201 1,346

also shows that the drop could have been reverted had the outcome of the cassation
remedy been favorable to Infinito.

By contrast, the reduction in market capitalization and share price was substantial and
permanent after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. Market capitalization fell
from CAD 17.4 million on 29 November 2011 to CAD 6.8 million on 1 December 2011
(the day after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision), i.e. a further decline of
approximately 61%.*47 The share price fell from CAD 0.14 on 29 November 2011 to
CAD 0.05 on 1 December 2011.348 From December 2011 to the end of February 2012,
the share price remained at a value of approximately 0.05.59 It then continued to
decline, reaching CAD 0.01 per share in January 2013, and has remained at or close
to zero ever since. 25°

Other elements in the record confirm that the Claimant did not suffer a substantial and
permanent deprivation until the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision:

a. BNP Paribas allowed its engagement letter to expire in November 2010.°5'
However, following the 2010 TCA Decision, Infinito continued to receive loans from
its investor Exploram to finance its ongoing operations.*5? The record further
suggests that BNP Paribas sought to renew its engagement, but Infinito decided
not to sign the letter because of the uncertainty about the timing of the cassation
decision.353

b. _ Infinito’s audited financial statements suggest that the Claimant suffered no loss of
asset value until after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. 354

c. The Claimant recorded impairment charges of USD 44.6 million in respect of the
Crucitas Project following the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.°°>
Conversely, the Claimant did not record an impairment after the TCA rendered its
Decision in 2010. Both the Claimant’s external auditor and FTI Consulting
confirmed that the 2010 TCA Decision did not warrant recording an impairment
charge for Infinito’s assets. °°

d. Mr. Peschke emphasized on numerous occasions that the loss stemmed from the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, and that any loss flowing fromthe TCA
Decision was reversible. °5”

The Claimant makes no distinction between the time when the alleged breach (in this
context, an expropriation) occurred and the time when it learned aboutit. In any event,
the Claimant could not have acquired knowledge of the loss before 30 November 2011.

The majority of the Tribunal thus finds that the Claimant acquired knowledge of the
alleged breach and of the loss after the cut-off date. On this basis, it concludes that the
Claimant’s expropriation claim is not time-barred under Article XII(3)(c).

This conclusion is consistent with the raison d’étre of a statute of limitations, which is
to promote legal certainty by avoiding that claimants delay bringing their claims. This
being so, for the statute of limitations to start running, the claimant must be legally in a
position to bring a claim. If a claim cannot be brought for legal reasons (for instance,
because the claim is not ripe), it would be fundamentally unfair to find that the statute
of limitations has started to run. Such a finding may entail that, in some instances, a
claimant/investor would have less time to initiate its claim than the statute of limitations.
In exceptional situations, that finding might even mean that the claimant/investor has
no time left at all to start proceedings, which would effectively resultin adenial of justice
— an outcome that cannot reflect the meaning of the Treaty. The fact that this situation
does notarise in the circumstances of this dispute is no answer to the issue of principle.

The Claimant submits that “Costa Rica has breached the FET standard based on the
composite effect of all of the challenged measures, and in particular the actions (and

Chamber Decision].”°5° For the Claimant, the challenged measures violated the

Claimant’s legitimate expectations; failed to treat Infinito’s investment in a consistent,
predictable manner; were arbitrary and served no rational purpose; and amount to a
denial of justice.59

The Tribunal addresses first whether the Claimant's FET claim (other than denial of
justice) is time-barred (a) and then whether the denial of justice claim is time-barred
(b). For purposes of the present jurisdictional inquiry, the Tribunal has assumed that a
judicial measure can breach the FET standard beyond a denial of justice, a matter
which is disputed °° and is addressed in Section VI.C.1.d(iii) infra. The present analysis
in no way purports to prejudge this matter, which is properly for the merits.

a. FET (Other than Denial of Justice)

The Claimant contends that its “legitimate expectation was that it would be allowed to
proceed through the legal framework established by the Mining Code in order to build
and operate the Crucitas project.”3°' This expectation was frustrated by the annulment
of the 2008 Concession by the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, *©* and the
prohibition set forth in the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and the 2012 MINAET
Resolution to apply for new permits. °° The Claimant also argues that these measures
breached its legitimate expectation to be treated in a consistent and predictable
manner.

Similarly, the Claimant submits that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the
2012 MINAET Resolution were arbitrary because they relied on the 2002 Moratorium
to annul the 2008 Concession, even though that moratorium had been repealed in
2008. °° The Respondent thus arbitrarily changed the legal framework applicable to the
Concession.%® Second, as an exploration permit holder, Industrias Infinito was entitled
to obtain new mining rights following the 2008 Concession’s annulment. The annulment
of its pre-existing mining rights served no rational purpose and was thus an arbitrary
measure. 96°

concession and other permits; the 2012 MINAE resolution that invalidated IISA’s remaining
rights in the administrative process; and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber decision that failed to
address the Contentious TCA’s violation of constitutional cosa juzgada and erga omnes
decisions. The combined result of these four measures was that, despite the years of
Government encouragement of investment in mining, the rights contained in the Mining Code
and the many steps different organs of the Government took to advance the Crucitas project,
IISA was left without any rights, or any opportunity to fix the defects identified by the
Administrative Chamber and obtain new rights.”)

The FET claim thus has two elements, one related to the possibility to operate the
Crucitas Project, which was frustrated by the 2008 Concession’s annulment, and
another premised on the impossibility to reinitiate the process after the 2011 Legislative
Mining Ban.

In respect of the first element, the alleged FET breach appears to have been completed
at the time when Industrias Infinito lost the 2008 Concession, which the Tribunal has
determined above occurred with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.*°’ As a
result, the claim that legitimate expectations were deceived by the annulment of the
2008 Concession is not time-barred.

As to the opportunity to apply for new permits, the FET breach appears to have been
completed with the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and the 2012 MINAET Resolution,
both of which prevented Industrias Infinito from fixing the defects in its current rights
and obtaining new mining rights.

The 2011 Legislative Mining Ban was enacted before the cut-off date, but it entered
into force thereafter (on 10 February 2011), and the Claimant could not have known
that it applied to the Crucitas Project until 30 November 2011. However, Industrias
Infinito was already precluded from obtaining new permits as a result of the 2010
Executive Moratoria, which had been in place since May 2010 and which were not
abrogated by the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. That said, the Claimant submits that the
effects of the Ban, which was permanent, were more preclusive than those of the
Moratoria, which were temporary. More specifically, it alleges that the 2011 Legislative
Mining Ban cancelled all pending proceedings and prohibited the renewal or extension
of all exploitation concessions in perpetuity, whereas the prior Moratoria only
suspended the proceedings.°%

The terms used by the 2010 Executive Moratoria and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban
are indeed different. Both the Arias and Chinchilla Moratoria declared a national
moratorium for an indefinite time on open-pit mining, which applied to all exploration
and exploitation activities that used cyanide and mercury.*°° By contrast, the 2011
Legislative Mining Ban “prohibited” mining exploitation in areas declared national parks,
biological reserves, forest reserves and state refuges of wildlife, and declared certain
mining reserve zones.°”° It also limited mining in any mining reserves to “cooperatives

See supra, Jf] 239-241.
Tr. Merits Day 1 (ENG), 45:20-46:4 (Mr. Terry).

Article 1 of the Arias Moratorium provided that “[a] national moratorium for an indefinite term is
declared for the activity of open pit metallic gold mining in the national territory. This is
understood as exploration, exploitation and processing using cyanide or mercury in the work to
recover the mineral.” Decree No. 35982-MINAET (29 April 2010), Article 1, Exh. R-0032
(English). In turn, Article 1 of the Chinchilla Moratorium amended Article 1 of the Arias

of workers for the development of mining in a small scale for the subsistence of families,
artisanal mining and prospector use (coligallero) from communities surrounding the
exploitation sites, based on the amount of affiliates of such cooperatives.” 371 It explicitly
added a new provision to the Mining Code stating that “[p]ermits or concessions shall
not be granted for the exploration and exploitation activities of open-pit mining of
metallic minerals on national territory,” and “established as an exception that only
exploration permits for scientific and investigatory purposes shall be granted.” 372 As a
result, the Tribunal finds that the effects of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban are not
identical to those of the 2010 Executive Moratoria, and are in principle capable of
triggering a separate FET breach. Accordingly, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion
that, to the extent that the Claimant’s legitimate expectations claim is related to the
opportunity to apply for new permits, it is not time-barred.

The 2012 MINAET Resolution which post-dates the cut-off implemented the annulment
of the 2008 Concession and declared the Crucitas area free of mining rights. It is a
mere administrative implementation of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. As
such, it must follow the fate of the claim pertaining to that decision which, as discussed
above, is not time-barred.$73

For the foregoing reasons, the majority of the Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s FET
claim is not time-barred.

b. Denial of Justice

At the Hearing on the Merits, the Claimant clarified that its case on denial of justice was
“structural”: it is premised on the Costa Rican judicial system’s failure to provide a
mechanism to solve contradictions between the various chambers of the Supreme
Court on questions of constitutional cosa juzgada.3” The claim is “not about the failure
to afford adue process,” nor “about the decisions themselves being arbitrary.”375 The
Claimant's submission is that the TCA first refused to uphold the constitutional cosa
juzgada deriving from the 2010 Constitutional Chamber Decision (the decision which
had declared the Crucitas Project constitutional from an environmental perspective),
and the Administrative Chamber did the same by denying the cassation request. 376 In
other words, the Costa Rican judicial system offers no mechanism to ensure
consistency, as was confirmed by the Constitutional Chamber itself when it dismissed
the Claimant's action to declare the 2010 TCA Decision unconstitutional on
admissibility grounds (through the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision).

The majority of the Tribunal considers that this claim is not barred by the statute of
limitations. Even if the initial failure to uphold constitutional cosa juzgada arises from
the 2010 TCA Decision, a denial of justice cannot occur until a decision has been
rendered by the highest court. The exhaustion of local remedies rule is a substantive
component of the denial of justice breach.°’””7 Because a denial of justice points to a
systemic flaw in the State’s administration of justice, there can be no denial of justice
until the system had a full opportunity to correctitself.°”8 Accordingly, the alleged denia
of justice could have occurred at the earliest with the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision, i.e. after the cut-off date.

(iii) | Full Protectionand Security

The Claimant’s full protection and security claim is premised on Costa Rica’s alleged
failure to provide /egal security to its investments. The Claimant's latest formulation of
its arguments appears to have two main components. First, “CostaRica failed to create
a legal system that protected IISA’s mining rights and provided a process for Infinito to
uphold its rights,” in particular because “[t]he Administrative Chamber [Decision] failed
to follow constitutional cosa juzgada, creating irreconcilable decisions between the
Administrative and Constitutional Chambers.”°’9 This component is thus virtually
identical to the Claimant’s denial of justice argument.

The second element of the submission is that the Costa Rican executive branch “failed
to rectify the situation” after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. *®° Rather than
protecting the Claimant’s investment, the MINAET chose to implement the decision,
and even went beyond what was legally required. With the 2012 MINAET Resolution,
the Government not only cancelled Industrias Infinito’s exploitation concession but also
its pre-existing mining rights. According to the Claimant, “CostaRica’s executive branch
had a duty not only to refrain from acting negligently, as it did, but to take actions to
correct unacceptable behavior.”%*' It adds that “[b]eyond the executive branch’s own
errors in granting IISA’s permits and approvals, it failed to adopt a mechanism to

See, e.g., Z. Douglas, The International Law of Investment Claims (Cambridge University Press,
2009), 7] 59, Exh. CL-0200 (noting that, in cases of denial of justice, “the local remedies rule is
a substantive requirement for liability rather than a procedural precondition for the
presentation of claims to an international court or tribunal.”) (Emphasis in original).

See, e.g., J. Paulsson, Denial of Justice in International Law (Cambridge University Press,
2005), p. 108, Exh. CL-0205 (“In the particular case of denial of justice, however, claims will not
succeed unless the victim has indeed exhausted municipal remedies, or unless there is an
explicit waiver of a type yet to be invented. (An ad hoc compromis might do.) This is neither a
paradox nor an aberration, for it is in the very nature of the delict that a state is judged by the
final product — or at least a sufficiently final product— of its administration of justice. A denial
of justice is not consummated by the decision of a court of first instance. Having sought to rely
on national justice, the foreigner cannot complain that its operations have been delictual until
he has given it scope to operate, including by the agency of its ordinary corrective functions.”)

address the inconsistencies in its legal system and thereby correct the untenable legal
situation in which Infinito found itself.”982

The Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the FPS claim is not time-barred. First, to
the extent that itis premised on Costa Rica’s failure to provide asystem that prevents
judicial inconsistency among the various decisions of the judiciary, the alleged FPS
breach could only have occurred on the date of the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision, or alternatively with the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, both of which
post-date the cut-off date. While it is true that the original inconsistency can be traced
to the 2010 TCA Decision (which is the one which originally purportedly failed to uphold
cosa juzgada constitucional), the claim is directed to the functioning of the judicial
system, which must be viewed as a whole, including the decision of the highest court.

Second, insofar as it relates to the 2012 MINAET Resolution, or to the Executive's
failure to redress the situation or otherwise protect Infinito’s investment after the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision, any such omission would have occurred after the
cut-off date.

Accordingly, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the FPS claim is not time-
barred.

(iv) Obligation to Do “What is Necessary” to Protect Infinito’s
Investments

Through the MFN clause of the BIT, the Claimant has invoked the more favorable FET
standard found at Article 3 of the Costa Rica-France BIT, which includes the obligation
to “do what is necessary so that the exercise of the right so recognized [/.e. FET]is not
impaired either in law or in fact.” 383

According to the Claimant, to comply with this standard, after the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision “Costa Rica should have taken positive steps to protect Infinito’s
investments, and in particular to protect the exploitation concession and the other
project approvals.” 964 Such steps could have included (i) granting Industrias Infinito a
new exploitation concession and new Project approvals not tainted by the supposed
defect identified by the Administrative Chamber; (ii) repealing the new moratorium on
open-pit mining, or ensuring that the new moratorium did not apply to Industrias Infinito;
or (iii) ensuring that there was a mechanism in place to address the inconsistencies
between the decisions of the different chambers of the Supreme Court. 385

In short, the claim relates to acts that the Respondent should have performed following
the cancellation of the 2008 Concession by the 201 1 Administrative Chamber Decision,
which post-dates the cut-off. Hence, according to the majority of the Tribunal, this claim
is not time-barred.

(v) Umbrella Clause

Again through the Treaty’s MFN clause, the Claimant further invokes the umbrella
clause requiring the host State to “comply with [or observe] any obligation assumed
regarding investments of investors of the other Contracting Party,” found in Costa
Rica's BITs with Taiwan and Korea. 8

The Claimant's position is that, by annulling the 2008 Concession, Costa Rica failed to
comply with its obligations under the Concession, specifically to grant Industrias Infinito
the exclusive right to exploit, extract and sell gold, silver, copper and associated
minerals from the Crucitas Project. 3°”

This claim is thus linked to the loss of the 2008 Concession. As such, it can be deemed
to follow the fate of the expropriation or FET claims insofar as the latter deal with the
annulment of the concession. As aresult, this claim is not time-barred.

(vi) Fifth Measure

In its Reply, the Claimant challenged a fifth measure: the reinitiation by the TCA of the
proceedings to quantify the costs due by Industrias Infinito and others to remedy the
environmental damage and return the Crucitas site to its pre-Project state. 388

The Claimant explains that the 2015 TCA Damages Decision ordered Industrias
Infinito, the Government and SINAC to bear the costs of restoring the Crucitas site to
its pre-Project condition.**° This decision was overturned by the Administrative
Chamber and remanded to the TCA in December 2017, where it sat inactive until
January 2019, when the TCA reinitiated these proceedings. The Claimant argues
that “[t]he continuation of this proceeding continues Costa Rica’s breach of the fair and

equitable standard, and any damages and costs (including defence costs) associated
with this proceeding are further damages to Infinito resulting from that breach.” 3%"

The facts invoked differ from the measures challenged under the other heads of claim.
The previous four measures are linked to Industrias Infinito’s loss of the 2008
Concession and relate to its inability to pursue it. This measure, however, relates to
damages that Industrias Infinito might be required to pay as a result of its use of the
site, which damages Infinito deems arbitrary given alleged environmental damage
suffered by the site after Industrias Infinito left it. Consequently, the Tribunal considers
that this claim pertains to a distinct FET violation, occurring if at all in 2019, that is after
the cut-off date. As a consequence, this claim is not time-barred.

For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent objects to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over this claim. First, it submits that the claim is premature and
falls outside of Costa Rica’s consent to arbitrate. It argues in this respect that the
Claimant has failed to fulfil the jurisdictional requirements under Article XII(1) in respect
of loss or damage, and has likewise failed to establish a prima facie case of breach.3%
This is essentially because there is no decision ordering the Claimant to pay damages,
as a result of which the Respondent also contends that the claim “is premature,
manifestly without legal merit and should be rejected.”°% In the Tribunal’s view, the
Respondent's jurisdictional objection relates to the fact that the claim is premature and
is thus properly a defense on the merits, which is addressed in Section VI.C.2.c(ii)c
infra. Indeed, the question is not whether the Tribunal has the authority to hear the
claim; the question is whether the claim is ripe enough to be heard. Second, the
Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to comply with the amicable
settlement, notice and waiver requirements under Article XII of the BIT. 3% The Tribuna
cannot agree: the provisions on amicable settlement and waiver set out at Article XII of
the BIT relate to the dispute as a whole; not to its individual claims. While the fifth
measure arises from subsequent facts, it forms part of the overall dispute related to the
failure of the Crucitas Project and the economic consequences of this failure on the
Claimant. The Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant was required to provide
notice of this claim, attempt to settle it or waive its rights to litigate it separately from the
other claims that form part of this dispute.

c. Conclusion

In light of the foregoing considerations, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the
claims are not time-barred.

indemnify Infinito for any amounts Infinito or IISA are required to pay as a result of, or in

It derives from this conclusion that the Tribunal can dispense with examining whether
the MFN clause may disable the statute of limitations under Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT.
Indeed, the Claimant submitted its MFN arguments in the event that the preconditions
of Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT were not met.°°5 The Tribunal has found in the foregoing
sections and in the Decision on Jurisdiction that all of the pre-conditions of Article XII(3)
are met, including its time bar provisions, with the result that the Claimant's MFN
arguments have become moot.3%6 For the same reason the Tribunal can dispense with
determining whether the Respondent's time bar objection goes to jurisdiction or
admissibility, as this question arose only if the Respondent prevailed on this objection
and in the context of the applicability of the BIT’s MFN clause. 99”

LIABILITY

Law APPLICABLE TO THE MERITS

Pursuant to Article XII(7) of the BIT, “[a] tribunal established under [Article XII] shall
decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement, the applicable rules of
international law, and with the domestic law of the host State to the extent that the
domestic law is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement or the principles
of international law.” 59°

Accordingly, the primary source of law for this Tribunal is the BIT itself, which must be
interpreted in accordance with the VCLT. Other sources of law may also be applicable,
as may be the case with Costa Rican domestic law, provided it is not inconsistent with
the BIT or principles of international law. As Article XII(7) of the BIT does not allocate
matters to specific sources of law, it is for the Tribunal to determine when an issue is
subject to the BIT, other rules of international law or domestic law.

When applying the law (whether national or international), the Tribunal is of the view
that it is not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. The maxim
jura novit curia — or better, jura novit arbiter— allows the Tribunal to apply the law of its
own motion, provided always that it seeks the Parties’ views if it intends to base its
decision on a legal theory that was not addressed and that the Parties could not
reasonably anticipate .399

OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

Overview of the Claimant's Position

The Claimant submits that the Respondent has breached four of its obligations under
the BIT.

First, the Claimants argues that Costa Rica failed to grant Infinito and its investments
FET in accordance with Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. According to the Claimant, this
provision provides for an autonomous standard that goes beyond the minimum
standard of treatment under customary international law (“MST”). More specifically, the
Claimant advances that the Respondent (i) breached the Claimant’s legitimate
expectations that “it would be allowed to follow the procedure set out under the Mining
Code [...] to obtain permits for, and ultimately build and operate, the Crucitas project”
and was arbitrary and inconsistent in the treatment of its investment; 4° (ii) committed
a procedural denial of justice by refusing to provide Infinito with a mechanism to
address the inconsistencies between the Costa Rican court decisions on the validity of
the Concession; and (iii) committed a substantive denial of justice by retroactively
applying to the Crucitas Project the 2002 Moratorium on open-pit mining activities.

Second, the Claimant argues that the Respondent did not grant to its investments FPS
within the meaning of Article II(2)(b) of the BIT. Indeed, for the Claimant, the
Respondent failed to take the necessary steps to ensure the legal security and
protection of its investments and thereby prevent the repudiation of its mining rights.

Third, the Claimant submits that the Respondent unlawfully expropriated the Claimant’s
investments. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision (which upheld the annulment
of the exploitation concession and other project approvals), the 2012 MINAET
Resolution and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban directly expropriated the Claimant's
Concession and other key approvals, as well as its mining rights. Through the
combination of these measures, the Respondent indirectly expropriated all of the
Claimant's investments.

Fourth, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent breached its substantive obligations
imported through the BIT’s MFN clause (i) to “do what is necessary” to protect Infinito’s
investments, and (ii) to comply with its legal obligations.

Overview of the Respondent’s Position

The Respondent denies that it has breached any of its obligations under the BIT.

First, the Respondent submits that the FET standard provided in Article II(2)(a) of the
BIT is limited to the MST. The consequences of this limitation are twofold: (i) legitimate
expectations are not protected under the BIT, and (ii) the fair and equitable treatment
that a State must grant with regard to judicial measures is limited to denial of justice.
According to the Respondent, the Claimant had in any event no legitimate expectations,
and Costa Rica did not commit a denial of justice.

Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimant mischaracterizes the FPS standard
provided in Article II(2)(b), which does not extend to legal security. In the alternative,
Costa Rica contends that the Claimant cannot reasonably expect the Government to
disregard the judicial decisions rendered by its domestic courts. By contrast, the
Respondent argues that its executive branch did what it could to protect Infinito’s
investments by defending the legality of the Concession in the proceedings before
Costa Rican courts.

Third, the Respondent argues that no expropriation could have taken place. Indeed,
Industrias Infinito’s mining rights (in particular, the exploitation concession) had been
cancelled ab initio in accordance with Costa Rican law. As a result, the Claimant held
no rights capable of being expropriated. In the alternative, the Respondentis of the
view that judicial measures cannot constitute an expropriation unless the investor
establishes that it suffered a denial of justice. The Respondent further contends that
the alleged expropriatory measures were adopted in accordance with the police powers
doctrine to enforce underlying measures aimed at protecting the environment against
open-pit mining activities.

Fourth, the Respondent argues that the MFN standard does not grant the Claimant the
right to import substantive protections from other investment treaties signed by Costa
Rica. In the alternative, the Respondent asserts that (i) it complied with the alleged
obligation to “do what is necessary” and (ii) that it has neither assumed nor breached
any specific obligation.

Finally, the Respondent submits that Section III(1) of Annex | to the BIT relieves it of
liability even if the Tribunal were to find that the challenged measures infringed the BIT.

Fair AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT

The Tribunal will first address the applicable FET standard under the BIT (1), before
reviewing whether the standard has been breached (2).

The FET Standard

The Tribunal will first summarize the Parties’ positions (a-b) as well as the Non-

a. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT requires the Respondentto grant to
its investments fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the principles of
international law.4°" Relying on El Paso, it submits that Article II(2)(a) “ensures basically
that the foreign investor is not unjustly treated, with due regard to all surrounding
circumstances,” and that “FET is a means to guarantee justice to foreign investors.”402
More specifically, the standard is intended to protect the Claimant’s investment against
various categories of harmful treatment, including measures which (i) breach its
legitimate expectations; (ii) lack legal basis or transparency; (iii) are adopted without
any legitimate purpose and are thus arbitrary; (iv) amount to a denial of justice; and (v)
are inconsistent with the good faith principle.4°>

Contrary to the Respondent's contentions, the Claimant submits that the FET standard
articulated in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is not limited to the MST (i). In any event, it
argues that the MST offers the same level of protection as the autonomous FET
standard (ii).

(i) The FET Standard in Article II(2)(a) ls Not Limited to the MST

Infinito submits that the FET standard enshrined in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is not
limited to the MST under customary international law. 4% It first argues that the ordinary
meaning of Article II(2)(a) does not limit the FET standard to the MST, as it does not
refer to the MST or to customary international law.4°5 As several investment tribunals
have held,4°° the reference to “principles of international law” does not restrict Article
1I(2)(a) to the MST under customary law.4°” Relying on Vivendi II, the Claimant notes
that there is “no basis for equating principles of international law with the minimum
standard of treatment.”4°8 By contrast, the decisions cited by the Respondent are

irrelevant because they do not explain why the expression “principles of internationd
law” should be understood to be an implicit reference to MST.4°9

Second, the fact that the Treaty may have been based on the North American Free
Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) does not mean that it must be interpreted in the same
manner.‘’° The wording of these treaties and their supplementary means of
interpretation are different. Article 1105 of the NAFTA refers explicitly to the MST, and
the NAFTA Free Trade Commission’s binding Notes of Interpretation, removed any
doubt by confirming that Article 1105 only covers the MST.*"" By contrast, the Treaty
does notrefer to the MST and there are no binding guidelines on its interpretation which
would support the Respondent's reading of Article II(2)(a).412

Third, so the Claimant says, none of the documents on which Costa Rica relies are part
of the context of the Treaty within the meaning Article 31(2) of the VCLT, as they are
not the BIT’s text, preamble or annexes, nor do they constitute agreements or
instruments related to the BIT.4‘? Costa Rica did not identify any subsequent
agreements between the BIT’s Contracting States or practice in the application of the
BIT.4"4 Canada’s submissions in unrelated disputes which the Respondent invokes do
not bind the Contracting States and do not reflect their intention at the time of signing
of the BIT.4"5

Fourth, Infinito contends that it is not necessary to use supplementary means of
interpretation within the meaning of Article 32 of the VCLT because the Treaty’s
language is clear. Relying on the Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction, the Claimant
submits that supplementary means of interpretation can only be used when “the
interpretation [...] leaves the meaning ‘ambiguous or obscure’ or leads to a result which
is ‘manifestly absurd or unreasonable’ or to confirm the interpretation that emerged.”416

In any event, the Claimant submits that Costa Rica has provided no evidence that could
qualify as a supplementary means of interpretation within the meaning of Article 32 of
the VCLT. For the Claimant, Article 32 “limits ‘supplementary means of interpretation’
to evidence that provides insight into the negotiations and events leading up to the
signing of the BIT [...].”4'7 However, the Respondent has not pointed to anything in the
travaux préparatoires that supports its restrictive interpretation of Article II(2)(a).
Rather, the evidence submitted by the Respondent (which includes academic writings,

statements by Infinito and unilateral statements by Costa Rican officials) does not
qualify as supplementary means of interpretation because it is subsequent to the
signing of the BIT and does not establish the Contracting States’ intent. 418

(ii) The Content of the FET Standard Is the Same Under the
Autonomous Standard or the MST

Infinito submits that the content of the MST and of the autonomous FET standard is
virtually the same.*19 Relying on Rusoro, it alleges that “the [MST] has developed and
today is indistinguishable from the FET standard and grants investors an equivalent
level of protection as the latter.”42° In the same vein, the tribunal in Waste Management
II held that the MST offers the same level of protection as the autonomous standard.42"

The Claimant further contends that the standard calls for a pragmatic and fact-based
approach: 42 “[t]he precise scope of the standard is therefore left to the determination
of the Tribunal to decide whether, in all of the circumstances, the conduct in issue is
fair and equitable or unfair and unequitable.” 425 Be this as it may, both standards protect
investors against “arbitrariness, gross unfairness, discrimination, a complete lack of
transparency,”424 including measures which frustrate their legitimate expectations.425
Relying on Mobil and Bilcon, the Claimant submits that an investor's legitimate
expectations are “relevant considerations” in finding a breach of the MST.4?6 In the
same vein, the tribunal in Glamis Gold held that “a State may be tied to the objective
expectations that it creates in order to induce investment.”42” The Claimant further
puts forward that Costa Rican law contains “a principle that a citizen can rely on
legitimate expectations created by the actions of Government.”428

The Claimant also disagrees with the Respondent's position that legitimate
expectations can only arise froma host State’s specific promises or guarantees that a
State would not change its legal framework.‘ It submits that legitimate expectations

may equally arise fromexplicit or implicit “undertakings and representations by the host
state, or the circumstances surrounding investment.”4°° Relying on Frontier Petroleum,
Infinito argues that “[t]he investor may rely on [the host state’s] legal framework as well
as on representations and undertakings made by the host state including those in
legislation, treaties, decrees, licenses, and contracts. Consequently, an arbitrary
reversal of such undertakings will constitute a violation of fair and equitable
treatment.” 431

Finally, the Claimant observes that denial of justice is not the only manner in which
judicial measures can breach the FET standard.**2 It points out that the BIT does not
distinguish between judicial, legislative or executive measures,*%> and finds the
Respondent's position inconsistent with “the principle that a state is internationally
responsible for the conduct of all its organs equally” as defined by the ILC’s Draft
Articles on State Responsibility and recognized in the Azinian decision.**4 The Claimant
further notes that its position has been endorsed by several arbitral decisions, including
Vivendi II, Arif and ATA.45 In any event, the Claimant is not only challenging the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision; its case is that “Costa Rica has breached the FET
standard based on the composite effect of all of the challenged measures, and in
particular the actions (and omissions) of the legislature and executive before and after
the Administrative Chamber's decision,” as “[i]t is as a result of those actions that the
Crucitas project was unable to proceed and Infinito’s investment became worthless.”43°

b. The Respondent’s Position

(i) The FET Standard Is Limited to the MST

For the Respondent, the legal standard under Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is the MST
under customary international law. The reference in Article II(2)(a) to the “principles of
international law” means that the standard is tied to the MST.43”

According to Costa Rica, its position is consistent with the rules of interpretation
provided in Article 31 of the VCLT. Indeed, reading Article II(2)(a) in light of the ordinary
meaning of the terms and of its context shows that it excludes the application of an

autonomous standard.428 The Contracting States would not have defined the FET
standard by reference to the “principles of intemational law’ if they intended to provide
for an autonomous standard. 439 The Claimant’s contrary view cannot be reconciled with
the fundamental treaty interpretation principle of effet utile or effectiveness.44°

The Respondent disputes that the majority of investment awards have held that the
reference to “principles of international law” does not limit the FET standard to the MST.
For instance, in UPS, Chemtura and ADF, the tribunals rejected the investors’ attempt
to import allegedly broader FET standards provided in other treaties, including the
Canada-Costa Rica BIT, through the MFN clause provided in the NAFTA. More
specifically, these tribunals held that the FET clauses invoked by the investors offered
the same substantive protection as the FET clause in the NAFTA, namely the MST.441
In addition, Koch, Rusoro and O/ concluded that the reference to “principles of
international law” or “international law’ in a FET clause meant a limitation to the MST
under customary international law. 442

The Respondent underlines that it has submitted abundant evidence supporting its
interpretation, such as express statements by Canada, “4? contemporaneous writings of
Canadian commentators, 444 and the Claimant's own regulatory filings with the United

States authorities,445 as well as Costa Rica’s contemporaneous understanding of
Article II(2)(a).44° It follows from this evidence, the Respondent argues, that the FET
standard in the BIT, such as the one in NAFTA “is tied to the minimum standard of
treatment.” 44” According to the Respondent, this evidence shows that the Contracting
States “understood the reference to ‘principles of international law’ as tied to the
minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.” 448

Even if the ordinary meaning of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT were not clear, supplementary
means of interpretation, so says CostaRica, show that the BIT’s FET standardis limited
to the MST under customary international law.*49 First, there is no evidence that the
Contracting States were willing to grant the investors an FET standard that would go
beyond the MST. To the contrary, when the BIT was signed, no arbitral decision had
been rendered on an autonomous FET standard offering more extensive protection
than what is required under the MST.4®° In other words, the Contracting States could
not have intended to grant an autonomous FET standard while the debate from which
this standard arose had not even started.45' Second, Canada’s treaty practice confirms
that Article I(2)(a) of the BIT is limited to the standard of treatment under customary
international law. 452

Finally, Costa Rica and Canada, so argues the former, confirmed in these proceedings
that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT was restricted to the minimum standard.*%? Indeed,
Canada has stated that “[t]he wording in Article II(2)(a) guarantees FET in accordance
with the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.”454 For the
Respondent, this constitutes a “subsequent agreement between the parties” (i.e., the
parties to the BIT) within the meaning of Article 31(3) of the VCLT, which demonstrates
the intent of the Contracting States. The Respondent further argues that Article 31(3)
of the VCLT requires no formal agreement for it to be effective.45°

(ii) The Content of the Autonomous FET Standard Is Different From
the Content of the MST

The Respondent doesnot share the Claimant's view that the content of the autonomous
FET standard and of the MST is the same.45° Even if the MST is a flexible concept, “it
has not evolved to the point of being identical or indistinguishable from the so-called
autonomous treaty standard,”457 nor has the Claimant met its burden of proving such
an evolution.4°8 More precisely, the MST standard does not protect the investor's
legitimate expectations and is more limited with regard to judicial measures.

First, the Respondent contends that the investor’s legitimate expectations are not
protected under the MST standard.459 No legal authority has held that a host State is
bound to protect an investor's legitimate expectations under customary internationd
law. 460

Relying on submissions by Canadain Mesa Power, the Respondent submits that there
is “no general and consistent State practice and opinio juris establishing an obligation
under the minimum standard of treatment not to frustrate investors’ ‘expectations.”4°"
The position in investment arbitration is consistent with the ICJ’s jurisprudence
according to which “[i]t does not follow from such references [to investment arbitration
decisions] that there exists in general international law a principle that would give rise

to an obligation on the basis of what could be considered a legitimate expectation.”462
Relying on Glamis Gold, the Respondent argues that “[aJt most, the investor's
expectations can be taken into account when analysing whether other components of
Article 1I(2)(a) have been breached.”463

Even in the autonomous FET standard, the Respondent submits that only expectations
that are objectively legitimate and reasonable qualify for protection. *© Specifically, such
expectations must meet the following requirements: “(i) they must derive from
representation[s] or assurances that induced the investor to invest; (ii) they should be
legitimate and reasonable in light of all the circumstances of the case; (iii) their exact
origin must be clearly identifiable; and (iv) they cannottrump the State’s right to regulate
within its territory (unless specific commitments of regulatory stability were given by the
State in favour of the investor).”4°5 By contrast, “in the absence of a stabilization clause,
legitimate expectations neither ensure that the legal environment in which the Claimant
invested will remain unchanged nor waive a State’s right to regulate in the public
interest.”466

Furthermore, an investor cannot expect a host State to refrain from revoking pre-
existing decisions under any circumstances.4®” The Respondent emphasizes that
“[o]ne of the pillars of a democratic State is the principle of separation of powers,” and
“[a]n investor cannot legitimately expect that the executive branch’s decisions cannot
be reviewed and annulled by independent municipal courts” when such decisions “are
not in accordance with the law.”468

Second, the Respondent submits that “judicial measures are only capable of violating
the customary international law minimum standard of treatment if such measures
amount to a denial of justice.”4°° Relying on Swisslion, Parkerings, Bosh and Jan de
Nul, the Respondent argues that this rule applies both under the MST and the
autonomous FET standard.47°

The Respondent explains that judicial measures cannot be assessed under a lower
standard than denial of justice, which requires the investor to show that the host State’s
judicial system failed as a whole to accord justice.4”' The contrary solution would allow
investors to circumvent the “high standard of denial of justice simply by claiming that
the challenged judicial measure is ‘unfair and inequitable’, even if it falls short of
constituting denial of justice.”472

The Respondent denies that its interpretation conflicts with the principle that a State is
internationally responsible for the conduct of all of its organs equally. Article 4 of the
ILC Articles (on which the Claimant relies for this argument) refers to the principle of
attribution, under which the conduct of any organ of the State must be regarded as an
act of that State. While the Respondent acknowledges that it is internationally
responsible for the conduct of all of its organs, including its courts, attribution is only
one component of State responsibility. While a decision froma judicial court is an act
of the State for purposes of Article 4, it may not necessarily constitute a breach of
international law.473

Accordingly, the Respondent argues that three of the five measures that the Claimant
challenges — the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2013 Constitutiond
Chamber Decision and the TCA Damages Proceedings — must be assessed under the
denial of justice standard.474

In sum, Costa Rica maintains that the FET and MST standards are not identical.
However, even if they were, the claim would still fail because “both standards set a high
threshold that the Claimant must meetif it is to persuade this Tribunal that Costa Rica
has breached that standard under the BIT.”475

c. Canada’s Position

Canada’s Non-Disputing Party Submission comments inter alia on the content of Article
11(2)(a) of the BIT.

Essentially, Canada submits that Article II(2)(a) guarantees FET in accordance with the
MST under customary international law. Canada contends that the phrase “in
accordance with principles of international law” is a reference to the MST. Pursuant to
the principle of effet utile, this phrase must be given meaning. This interpretation is
confirmed by the Notes of Interpretation issued under some of Canada’s treaties, such
as the one under the NAFTA.476

According to Canada, “[t]here is no difference between the FET standard in NAFTA
Article 1105(1) and Article II(2)(a) of the Canada-Costa Rica FIPA.”4’7 Canada has
consistently expressed the position that its post-NAFTA FIPAs, including the Canada-
Costa Rica FIPA, are based on the NAFTA. Canadaalso argues that, “in clarifying and
reaffirming the meaning of the provisions, the Notes of Interpretation under Canada’s
other treaties do not amend or alter the substantive obligation.”47° As a result, “tribunas
have rejected attempts to distinguish NAFTA Article 1105(1) from the FET obligations
in Canada’s post-NAFTA FIPAs, including Article II(2)(a) of the Canada-Costa Rica
FIPA.” 479

Canada further opines that “the disputing party alleging the existence of a rule of
customary international law has the burden of provingit,” and that “[t]his high threshold
for proving a breach of FET in accordance with customary international law is what
distinguishes the obligation in Article II(2)(a) from the autonomous FET standard.”48° In
order to establish the content of the FET standard under customary international law,
the investor must provide proof of State practice and opinio juris, i.e., “evidence of
consistent and general practice amongst States that is supported by a conviction by
States that such practice is legally required by themunder international law.” 481 For this
purpose, the investor must point to the actions of States, not to decisions of arbitral
tribunals. Citing Glamis Gold and Cargill, Canada submits that “[p]ast arbitral decisions
are only relevant to the extent that they include an examination of State practice and
opinio juris;”4®2 “arbitral decisions that apply an autonomous standard provide no
guidance inasmuch as the entire method of reasoning does not bear on an inquiry into
custom.”483

As to the content of the FET standard under customary international law (and hence
Article 1I(2)(a) of the BIT), Canada makes the following submission:

a. It does not allow tribunals to second-guess Government policy and decision-
making, because “international law generally grants a high level of deference to
States with respect to their domestic policy choices and balancing of public interest
and individual rights.” 484

b. It does not protect an investor’s legitimate expectations. According to Canada,
“[t]he mere failure to fulfil a commitment does not, without more, fall below the
customary international law standard of treatment.” 485

c. Denial of justice is the only basis upon which judgments of a domestic court may
violate the FET standard under customary international law. Canada’s
“consistently held position” is that (i) absent a denial of justice, judicial measures
cannot breach the MST, and (ii) “claims of arbitrariness or unfairness in the context
of judicial decisions must be viewed through the lens of denial of justice.”4°° For a
denial of justice to occur, there must be avery serious failure in the administration
of justice. The erroneous application of the law is not sufficient; there must be
manifest injustice or gross unfairness. According to Canada, “[t]his rule stems from
the recognition of the independence of the judiciary and the great deference
afforded to domestic courts acting in their bona fide role of adjudication and
interpretation of a State’s domestic law.” 48”

d. Analysis

The Tribunal will first determine whether the FET standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT
is limited to the MST under customary international law (i). It will then set out the content
of the FET standard under Article 1I(2)(a) (ii). The Tribunal will then address the
question whether judicial decisions may breach the FET standard only through a denial
of justice (iii). This Section sets out the analysis and conclusions of the majority of the
Tribunal, even when it is not expressly so stated. Arbitrator Stern will develop her views
in her Separate Opinion on Jurisdiction and Merits.

(i) Is the Protection Afforded by Article Il(2)(a) Limited to the MST?

Article 1I(2)(a) of the BIT provides that “[e]Jach Contracting Party shall accord
investments of the other Contracting Party: (a) fair and equitable treatment in
accordance with principles of international law; [...].”488

The Claimant argues that this provision provides for an autonomous FET standard,
while the Respondent considers that it is limited to the MST under international law.

The Respondent has pointed to several awards in which the tribunals have held that
the reference to “principles of international law” or to “international law” is equivalent to
“customary international law.”4°9 In turn, the Claimant has referred to other awards that

have reached the contrary conclusion.4%° While these decisions may provide guidance,
the Tribunal must conduct its own interpretation of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT in
accordance with the rules of treaty interpretation set out in the VCLT.

The Respondent further argues that the text of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is very similar
to that of NAFTA Article 1105(1), which provides that “[e]ach Party shall accord to
investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international
law, including fair and equitable treatment [...].”491 Yet, Article 1105 is expressly entitled
“Minimum Standard of Treatment,” a reference that is absent from Article II(2)(a) of the
BIT. Moreover, in their Notes of Interpretation issued in 2001. the NAFTA Contracting
States clarified that Article 1105(1) prescribes the “customary international law
minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be
afforded to investments of investors of another Party” and that “[t]he concepts of ‘fair
and equitable treatment’ and ‘full protection and security’ do not require treatment in
addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum

an independent or autonomous meaning”); Rusoro, J 520, Exh. RL-0181 (“[As] the BIT qualifies
Venezuela’s commitment to accord FET (and FPS) treatment ‘in accordance with the principles
of international law’, the rule is referring to the CIM [or customary international minimum]
Standard”); O/, 482, Exh. CAN-0006 (‘I]t is not true that the Treaty with the United Kingdom
offers superior treatment to the minimum customary standard, since in reality it only offers
protected investors FET ‘in accordance with international law.’ The Treaty therefore does not
guarantee FET in abstract, but rather only as recognized by international law. And the level of
protection that international law offers and ensures to foreign nationals is precisely what is
known as the minimum customary standard.”)

Vivendi II, {17.4.5-7.4.7, Exh. CL-0029 (Dealing first with Respondent's argument that the fair
and equitable treatment is limited to and to be weighed against the so-called minimum standard
of treatment under international law, the Tribunal concludes that there is no basis for sucha

Article 3. Article 3 refers to fair and equitable treatment in conformity with the principles of
international law, and not to the minimum standard of treatment. [...] The Tribunal sees no basis
for equating principles of international law with the minimum standard of treatment. First, the
reference to principles of international law supports a broader reading that invites consideration
of a wider range of international law principles than the minimum standard alone. Second, the
wording of Article 3 requires that the fair and equitable treatment conform to the principles of
international law, but the requirement for conformity can just as readily seta floor as a ceiling
on the Treaty’s fair and equitable treatment standard. Third, the language of the provision
suggests that one should also look to contemporary principles of international law, not only to
principles from almost a century ago.”); Total, 125, Exh. CL-0088 ([...] the phrase ‘fair and

standard. Unlike treaties such as NAFTA, which expressly incorporate the minimum standard
of treatment, the Canada-Venezuela BIT nowhere refers to such minimum standard.”); EDF, |

standard of treatment of aliens.”492 No such note of interpretation has been issued by
the Contracting Parties to the BIT.

Applying the general rule of interpretation set out in Article 31 of the VCLT, 4° the
majority of the Tribunal cannot conclude that the content of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is
limited to the MST under customary international law.

Starting first with the ordinary meaning of the terms, there is nothing in the text of the
BIT that limits the FET standard to customary intemational law. Article II(2)(a) provides
that the Contracting Parties are required to accord to investments fair and equitable
treatment “in accordance with principles of international law.” The words “principles of
international law” could be understood as a reference to the general principles of law
cited in Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute (“GPL”). It is now widely accepted that GPL
include both general principles that emanate from domestic laws (foro domestico) and
are then transposed to international law after an appropriate distillation process, as well
as general principles of international law that have emerged directly on the internation
plane.4% Alternatively, the reference to “principles of intemational law’ could designate

“Article 31. GENERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be
given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to
the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in
connection with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the
conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to
the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the
treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the
agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.
4. Aspecial meaning shall be given to a term if itis established that the parties so intended.”

The Tribunal finds confirmation of its understanding forinstance in Special Rapporteur Vazquez-
Bermudez, First Report on General Principles of Law by Special Rapporteur, International Law
Commission Seventy-+irst Session (Geneva, 29 April— 7 June and 8 July — 9 August 2019)

the various sources of international law set out in Article 38(1) of the ICJ Statute.495 By
contrast, the expression “principles of international law” cannot be regarded as a
reference to customary international law, which is but one source of international law
and is distinct from general principles. That understanding would imply adding limiting
language to Article II(2)(a) of the BIT that the provision does not contain. As noted by
the Vivendi II tribunal, “the reference to principles of international law supports a
broader reading that invites consideration of a wider range of international law
principles than the minimum standard alone.”4%°

More specifically, GPL (including both principles arising from domestic laws and
general principles of international law) are a source of international law distinct from
custom. ‘97 For a rule of customary international law to emerge, it requires uniform and
consistent State practice and the acceptance of this practice as law (opinio juris).4°° By
contrast, GPL are a more flexible concept; they may emerge in a number of ways
(including from treaties, case law of international courts and tribunals, and custom‘)
and require “recognition” from States, 5°° rather than acceptance as law.5°"

The Tribunal thus concludes that, in accordance with their ordinary meaning, the terms
used by Article II(2)(a) cannot be interpreted as a reference to customary internationa
law in general or to the MST in particular.

There is likewise nothing in the context of the provision that would lead to restricting
the FET standard to the MST. Neither the text of other provisions of the BIT, nor its
preamble or annexes, limit the FET standard to customary international law. To the
contrary, when chosing the applicable law, the Contracting Parties to the BIT made a

distinction between “rules of international law’ and “principles of international law’,
which distinction is unhelpful to decide whether Article II(2)(a) refers to customary
international law only or to international law in its entirety.

Nor is there “any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the
parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty,” or “any instrument which was
made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and
accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty” 5°? establishing that
Article II(2)(a) of the BIT must be interpreted as limiting the FET standard to the MST
under customary international law.

Article 31(3) of the VCLT further provides that the interpreter must take into account,
together with the context, “(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties
regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions; (b) any
subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of
the parties regarding its interpretation; [and] (c) any relevant rules of international law
applicable in the relations between the parties.”5° The Respondent argues in this
respect that both Costa Rica and Canada have confirmed in this arbitration that Article
Il(2)(a) of the BIT is limited to the MST, and that this constitutes a “subsequent
agreement between the parties” pursuant to Article 31(3) of the VCLT that
demonstrates the intent of the Treaty’s Contracting States. According to the
Respondent, Article 31(3) of the VCLT does not require any formal agreementin “treaty
form” to be effective.5

In the Tribunal’s view, Costa Rica’s and Canada’s concurrent positions in this
arbitration do not amount to an agreement within the meaning of Article 31(3) of the
VCLT. As Roberts explains, agreements on treaty interpretation “need not be in binding
or treaty form but must demonstrate that the parties intended their understanding to
constitute an agreed basis for interpretation.”°°> Oppenheim’s International Law also
notes that the parties to a treaty “may in some other way and before, during, or after
the conclusion of the treaty, agree upon the interpretation of a term, either informally
(and executing the treaty accordingly) or by a more formal procedure, as by an
interpretative declaration or protocol or a supplementary treaty.” °° Yet, the Contracting
Parties must have agreed to a particular interpretation. This requires a joint
manifestation of consent from the Contracting Parties, or at least an offer and
acceptance, evidencing their common intention that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT reflects
the MST under customary international law.

No such consent is found here. The submissions made by Costa Rica and Canada in
this arbitration reflect legal arguments put forward in the context of this dispute to
advance their respective interests. Although they happen to coincide, they do not reflect
an agreement as just described over the interpretation of the BIT. Even if the Tribuna
could infer an “agreement” from the Contracting States’ submissions, quod non, this
agreement would postdate the commencement of this arbitration and the Tribunal could
nottake it into consideration in favour of one litigant to the detriment of the other without
incurring the risk of breaching the latter's due process rights.

Finally, Article 31(4) of the VCLT requires the interpreter to give a treaty term “[a]
special meaning [...] if it is established that the parties so intended.” The Tribuna
finds that the Respondent has not met its burden of proving that the Contracting Parties
intended the terms “fair and equitable treatment in accordance with principles of
international law” to mean “the minimum standard of treatment under customary
international law.”

The Respondent and Canada also rely on the principle of effectiveness or effet utile,
which the Respondentargues is “broadly accepted as a fundamental principle of treaty
interpretation.”©° They argue that, if the Claimant’s interpretation of Article II(2)(a) of
the BIT were correct, the terms “in accordance with principles of international law”
would be rendered meaningless. *®°9 The Tribunal cannot agree. When determining the
protection owed under Article II(2)(a), the Tribunal must be guided by international law
(be it GPL or sources of international law in general) as opposed to subjective notions
of fairness and equity. The BIT was signed in 1998, before any meaningful debate on
the meaning of FET had taken place and before the Mondevtribunal famously clarified
that a tribunal “may not simply adopt its own idiosyncratic standard of what is ‘fair’ or
‘equitable’, without reference to established sources of law.”51°

The UNCTAD Series on the FET standard, on which the Respondent relies, confirms
this interpretation: 5"

This formulation [provisions stating that investments ‘shall be accorded fair
and equitable treatment in accordance with international law] prevents the
use of apurely semantic approachto the interpretation of the FET standard
and is meant to ensure that the interpreter uses principles of international
law, including, but not limited to, customary international law. Indeed a
tribunal faced with such language may not go beyond what the sources of
international law dictate the scope and meaning of FET to be. It requires a
review of the sources to ascertain whether a specific claim that a State’s

conduct breaches fair and equitable treatment is justified. General
principles of law derived from national legal systems may prove useful in
analysing the scope of the relevant FET obligations (Schill, 2010). The
process of discerning such principles can be laborious, but it will advance
the understanding of the FET content.

Itis true that the Respondent has pointed to various sources which suggest that Article
1l(2)(a) of the BIT should be given the same interpretation as NAFTA 1105, and that it
was the Contracting Parties’ intention that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT referred to the MST.
The Tribunal cannot give weight to these sources because they do not qualify as means
of interpretation under the general rule of Article 31 of the VCLT, noris there reason to
resort to supplementary interpretation means as the application of Article 31 does not
result in a meaning that is “ambiguous or obscure” or “manifestly absurd or
unreasonable.” Even if the Tribunal were inclined to use supplementary means to
“confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31,” the sources invoked
by Costa Rica would not constitute such means as they do notrelate to “the preparatory
work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion.”

The Respondent first refers to “express statements by Canada” which would confirm
that the BIT is based on the NAFTA.5'2 However, these statements are arguments
made by Canada in UPS v. Canada arguing that foreign investment protection
agreements were based on the NAFTA.5"3 Similarly, the Respondent alleges that, like
Canada, Costa Rica “has consistently held that the fair and equitable treatment
obligation under its investment protection treaties does not establish an autonomous
standard.”5"4 In support, the Respondent points to its defense in pleadings in arbitration
proceedings.5'5 These sources reflect Canada’s and Costa Rica’s litigation posture,
and do not qualify as means of treaty interpretation under Article 31 of the VCLT. More
specifically, none of these cases was based on the Treaty and thus these statements
cannotestablish a “practice in the application of the treaty” within the meaning of Article
31(3)(b) of the VCLT.

The Respondent has also referred to the contemporaneous writings of Canadian
commentators explaining that Canada’s foreign investment protection treaties
(‘FIPAs”) post-dating the NAFTA are based on NAFTA’s Chapter 11 and the
obligations thereunder should be given the same interpretation.5'® However, it is
unclear how the writings of commentators could qualify as context of the BIT under
Article 31 of the VCLT; nor do they constitute subsequent agreement or practice of the
Contracting States, or rules of international law applicable to them. Finally, they are not

supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the VCLT, as they do not
serve to establish the intent of the Contracting States.

For the same reasons, the Tribunal can give no weight to the Claimant's regulatory
filings with the United States authorities, in which Infinito stated that the FIPAs such as
the BIT were “based on the investment protection standards of the NAFTA investment
chapter.”5'” Statements made by an investor who is not a party to the Treaty do not
qualify as means of interpretation under the VCLT.

The Respondent has also submitted two documents which purportedly evidence its
understanding of Article II(2)(a) at the time when the BIT was concluded. The first is a
Memorandum by the Ministry of Foreign Trade of Costa Rica to the President of the
Permanent Committee on Economic Affairs of the Legislative Assembly, sent in
connection with the approval of the bilateral investment treaties concluded by Costa
Rica with Canada, Paraguay, Spain and Argentina, and explaining the scope and
content of bilateral investment treaties generally.5"® With respect to “fair and equitable
treatment,” the memorandum states that “[i]t is generally accepted that the primary
purpose of this type of clause is to offer the investment a minimum standard of
protection in accordance with the principles of international law.”5'9 While this
memorandum might reflect Costa Rica’s understanding, it does not qualify as
supplementary means of interpretation, as it is not “preparatory work of the treaty,” nor
does it provide information on the “circumstances of its conclusion.”5° Nor can it be
characterized as an “instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion
with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument
related to the treaty” within the meaning of Article 31(2)(b) of the VCLT, as there is no
evidence that Canada has accepted it as relating to the BIT.

The second document cited by the Respondent is an economic report on the BIT
presented to the Legislative Assembly in July 1998, which states that the BIT was
based on Canada’s 1994 model FIPA, which was in turn based, inter alia, on the
NAFTA.*' Itis not clear fromthe documentitself whetherthe authors were Government

Officials522 (indeed, the Respondent has filed this as a legal authority, not as a fact
exhibit). Even if they were, for the reasons given in the preceding paragraph, it cannot
qualify as context of the treaty under Article 31(2)(b) of the VCLT, or as supplementary
means of interpretation under Article 32 of the VCLT.

Even accepting that the BIT was drafted on the basis of Canada’s model FIPA, which
in turn was based on or inspired by NAFTAChapter 11, this does not necessarily mean
that it offers investorsidentical protections as the NAFTA. Faced with a treaty provision,
the Tribunal must interpret it in accordance with the rules of interpretation of the VCLT,
in particular its text and context; it cannot dispense with doing so simply because a
provision might have been inspired by another treaty.

The majority of the Tribunal thus concludes that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT provides for
an autonomous FET standard and is not limited to the MST under customary
international law.

(ii) Content of the FET Standard

To ascertain the content of the FET standard, the Tribunal must again start by
assessing the ordinary meaning of the words. However, the ordinary meaning of “fair
and equitable treatment’ is of limited assistance.523 These notions can “only be defined
by terms of almost equal vagueness,”54 such as “just”, “even-handed”, “unbiased”, and
“legitimate.” 525 The tribunal in S.D. Myers for instance stated that, unfair and inequitable
treatment means “treat[ment] in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment
rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective.”526 As noted
in Saluka, “[t]his is probably as far as one can get by looking at the ‘ordinary meaning’
of the terms of Article 3.1 of the Treaty.”527

That being said, while the terms “fair and equitable” are vague, they “are susceptible of
specification throughjudicial practice and do in fact have sufficient legal content to allow

status is unclear. Indeed, the Respondent characterizes this document as “report submitted to

the case to be decided on the basis of law,”52 and more specifically on the basis of
principles of international law as mandated by Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. Indeed, in
elucidating the content of the autonomous FET standard, investment tribunals have
extracted a number of inherent components, which are implicitly if not expressly derived
from GPL and have been reflected in the decisions of international tribunals. For
instance, the tribunal in Rumeli held that:

The parties rightly agree that the fair and equitable treatment standard
encompasses inter alia the following concrete principles: - the State must
act in a transparent manner; - the State is obliged to act in good faith; - the
State’s conduct cannot be arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic,
discriminatory, or lacking in due process; - the State must respect
procedural propriety and due process. The case law also confirms that to
comply with the standard, the State must respect the investor's reasonable
and legitimate expectations. °°

Similarly, the tribunal in Lemire identified the following components of the FET
standard:

[W]hether the State has failed to offer a stable and predictable legal
framework; - whether the State made specific representations to the
investor; - whether due process has been denied to the investor; - whether
there is an absence of transparency in the legal procedure or in the actions
of the State; - whether there has been harassment, coercion, abuse of
power or other bad faith conduct by the host State; - whether any of the
actions of the State can be labeled as arbitrary, discriminatory or
inconsistent.5°

In the same vein, the Electrabel tribunal described the content of the FET standard as
follows:

[T]he obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment comprises several
elements, including an obligation to act transparently and with due
process; and to refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures or
from frustrating the investor's reasonable expectations with respect to the
legal framework adversely affecting its investment."

While formulations may vary across awards, a consensus emerges as to the core
components of FET, which encompass the protection of legitimate expectations, the
protection against conduct that is arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate and lacking

in good faith, and the principles of due process and transparency. FET also includes a
protection against denial of justice.

(iii) | Can Judicial Measures Breach the FET Standard Outside of a
Denial of Justice?

Three of the measures challenged by the Claimant — the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision, the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision and the TCA Damages
Proceeding — are judicial measures. The Respondent and Canada submit that judicial
measures can only engage the State’s international responsibility if they amount to a
denial of justice. The Claimant challenges this position, arguing that neither the BIT nor
the ILC Articles on State Responsibility preclude international State responsibility for
acts of judicial organs that do not qualify as a denial of justice.

Costa Rica and Canada essentially argue that, absent a denial of justice, judicial
decisions interpreting domestic law cannot breach intemational law, and that “claims of
arbitrariness or unfairness in the context of judicial decisions must be viewed through
the lens of denial of justice.’®°* The Tribunal agrees that this is the case under
customary international law. The question before the Tribunal is, however, whether
judicial measures breach the BIT’s FET standard, which the Tribunal has held not to
be limited to the MST under customary international law.

To discharge its mandate, which is to determine whether Costa Rica has breached the
BIT, the Tribunal must assess whether the State’s conductis contrary to the obligations
that Costa Rica assumed under the BIT. Judicial measures “emanat[e] from an organ
of the State in just the same way as a law promulgated by the legislature or a decision
taken by the executive.”5%3 The BIT does not distinguish between the acts of different
Government branches. When Costa Rica committed itself to treating the Claimant's
investments fairly and equitably, it did not exclude the acts of the judiciary from this
obligation.5*4 Nor did it specify that breaches of the FET standard were limited to
instances of denial of justice or other forms of manifest arbitrariness or lack of due
process.

In the majority of the Tribunal’s view, there is no principled reason to limit the State’s
responsibility for judicial decisions to instances of denial of justice. Holding otherwise
would mean that part of the State’s activity would not trigger liability even though it
would be contrary to the standards protected under the investment treaty. While the

Tribunal agrees that domestic courts must be given deference in the application of
domestic law, this does not mean that their decisions are immune from scrutiny at the
international level. As noted by the tribunal in Sistem, court decisions may deprive
investors of their property rights “just as surely as if the State had expropriated [them]
by decree.”5%5 In the same vein, judicial decisions that are arbitrary, unfair or contradict
an investor's legitimate expectations may also breach the FET standard even if they do
not rise to the level of a denial of justice.55¢

Crucially, the question before investment tribunals is not whether the domestic court
misapplied its own domestic law. The question is whether, in its application of domestic
law, the court has breached international law, and more specifically, the standards of
protection contained in the relevant treaty. 597 In the words of the Azinian tribunal, “[w]hat
must be shown is that the court decision itself constitutes a violation of the treaty.”59°
This can happenif the court misapplies domestic law, butalso when it applies domestic
law correctly, if itleads to a result that is incompatible with international law. In the latter
case, it could be said that it is the underlying law which breaches the treaty. However,
if the courtis the first State organ to apply that law to the investor, itis the court decision
which perpetrates the breach of the treaty.

The majority of the Tribunal thus concludes that denial of justice is only one of the ways
in which judicial decisions may breach the BIT. Even if a decision does not amount to
a denial of justice, it may violate other treaty standards (such as FET or expropriation),
provided the requirements for these breaches are met.

It is true that there are authorities putting forward acontrary view. For these authors®*9

denial of justice appears to lie in the nature of the court function and, as the
Respondent's put it, in “the recognition of the judiciary’s independence and the great
deference afforded to domestic courts acting in their bona fide role of adjudication and
interpretation of a State’s domestic law.”>4' That deference seems linked to the courts’
decision making-process, which resolves complex legal questions and involves a
choice among plausible options. 54? While these considerations certainly justify restraint
when international tribunals consider the local courts’ application of domestic law, in
the Tribunal’s opinion, they cannot be an obstacle to adjudicating on breaches of
international law.*3

This being so, the conclusion of the Tribunal’s majority is supported by numerous
scholars and investment tribunals. Paulsson submits that “[a] national court’s breach of
other [non-procedural] rules of international law, or of treaties, is not a denial of justice,
but a direct violation of the relevant obligation imputable to the state like any acts or
omissions by its agents.”5“4 Similarly, Gharavi argues that “[t]he acts or measures of
the judiciary can [...] be found in violation of the FET standard irrespective of a finding
of a denial of justice.”545

This position is not limited to contemporary authorities. Former |CJ President Eduardo
Jiménez de Aréchaga considered that denial of justice was not the only cause of action
that could give rise to international responsibility for acts of the judiciary:

[I]n the present century State responsibility for acts of judicial organs came
to be recognized. Although independent of the Government, the judiciary
is not independent of the State: the judgment given by a judicial authority

erroneous judgment [...] shall not in itself run against international law, including the Treaty.”
Bosh, J 280, Exh. RL-0120 (“It is only in a situation where those proceedings would ‘[offend] a
sense of judicial propriety’ that it would be open to the Tribunal to find that those proceedings
did not meet international standards.”) The Tribunal notes that the Respondent has also cited
to other cases which purportedly confirm the position, including Swisslion. Yet, in that case the
tribunal only stated that “ICSID tribunals are not directly concerned with the question whether
national judgments have been rendered in conformity with the applicable domestic law. They
only have to consider whether they constitute a violation of international law, and in particular
whether they amount to a denial of justice” (Swisslion, | 264, Exh. RL-0112), a statement that
does not limit liability for judicial acts to cases of denials of justice.

emanates from an organ of the State in just the same way as a law
promulgated by the legislature or a decision taken by the executive.

The responsibility of the State for acts of judicial authorities may
result from three different types of judicial decision.

The first is a decision of a municipal court clearly incompatible with
a rule of international law.

The second is what it known traditionally as a ‘denial of justice.’

The third occurs when, in certain exceptional and well-defined

circumstances, a State is responsible for a judicial decision contrary to
municipal law.

International courts and tribunals have also accepted that a judicial decision may
amount to a treaty breach in the absence of a denial of justice. Most tribunals have
addressed this from the perspective of expropriation. For instance, the Iran-US Claims
Tribunal admitted that “it is well established in international law that the decision of a
court in fact depriving an owner of the use of his property may amount to an
expropriation of such property [...].”54” Further, in Karkey, the tribunal held that “an
international tribunal may decide not to defer to an arbitrary judicial decision which is,
as such, incompatible with international law.” It ultimately found that the Supreme
Court judgment which had declared the relevant contract to be void ab initio was
arbitrary and amounted to an expropriation of the investor’s contractual rights.549 In
Saipem, the tribunal held that the Bangladeshi courts had expropriated the claimant's
right to an ICC award because they had “exercised their supervisory jurisdiction for an
end which was different from that for which it was instituted and thus violated the
internationally accepted principle of prohibition of abuse of rights.”5°°

Other investment tribunals have found that judicial decisions may breach FET even
when they do not amount to denials of justice. In Tatneft, the tribunal assessed the
decisions of the Ukrainian domestic courts against the broader FET standard, noting
that “[t]he discussion about whether these various decisions amounted to a denial of
justice is immaterial because what this Tribunal has to determine in the end is whether
they were manifestly unfair and unreasonable.”5*" It also noted that “[a] predictable,

consistent and stable legal framework is a FET requirement which ought to be
safeguarded in its integrity irrespective of which organ of the State might compromise
its availability as is well recognized under international law in the context of attribution
of wrongful acts.”55? Similarly, the tribunal in Eli Lilly was “unwilling to shut the door’ on
claims based on judicial measures not amounting to a denial of justice, such as when
court decisions are manifestly arbitrary or blatantly unfair.5°? The Tribunal in Frontier
Petroleum likewise assessed a decision of the Czech courts against the broader FET
standard.5*4 Finally, the tribunal in Arif accepted the possibility that a judicial decision
that frustrated the investor's legitimate expectations could amount to a breach of
FET.555

The authorities cited above corroborate the Tribunal’s majority conclusion that Costa
Rica may incur international responsibility as a result of the decisions of its courts even
in the absence of a denial of justice. The existence of such responsibility will depend
on whether the requirements of the various treaty standards, such as FET or
expropriation, are met.

conduct that may amount to a denial (or gross denial) of justice and other conduct that may also

is also apparent, in the Tribunal’s view, that concepts of manifest arbitrariness and blatant
unfairness are capable, as a matter of hypothesis, of attaching to the conduct or decisions of
courts. It follows, in the Tribunal’s view, that a claimed breach of the customary international law
minimum standard of treatment requirement of NAFTA Article 1105(1) may be properly a basis

reference to uncontroversial principles of State responsibility. As a matter of principle, therefore,
having regard to the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment,

Did the Respondent Breach the FET Standard?

a. The Claimant’s Position

 

(i) The Respondent Bi hed the Claii ’s L
Expectations and Treated it Arbitrarily and Inconsistently

On the basis of the legal framework in place at the time when it invested, Infinito claims
that it had a reasonable and legitimate expectation that it would be able to proceed with
the Crucitas Project in accordance with the provisions set out under the Mining Code,
which contained no moratorium at that time.5° More specifically, Infinito’s expectations
included receiving an exploitation concession when the statutory preconditions were
met, having the opportunity to apply for and be treated fairly in respect of remaining
approvals, and ultimately to build and operate the Crucitas mine once those
administrative processes had been fulfilled. 5”

The Claimant argues that it decided to invest in Costa Rica since the Government
strongly encouraged investment in mining exploration as a means of bringing
development to the economically depressed north of the country and repeatedly
confirmed that mining was a major component of Costa Rica’s economic development.
In 1997, the President even went so far as to declare that mining was an industry of
national convenience. 558

According to Infinito, Costa Rica created a clear legal framework for investments in
mining. Under the terms of the Mining Code, the first step in acquiring the right to a
mining project is to obtain an exploration permit. If the exploration permit holder
successfully proves the existence of a mineral deposit, it is entitled — as of right - to an
exploitation concession.55° Once an exploitation concession is granted, it may only be
annulled or cancelled on very limited grounds set out in the Mining Code and under a
set procedure. 5

The Claimant submits further that its expectation that the Crucitas Project would be
allowed to proceed arose directly from the Government's conduct. Costa Rica
confirmed this expectation by treating Industrias Infinito consistently with its legislative
scheme: after it had proved the existence of gold deposits at Crucitas, Industrias Infinito
was granted an exploitation concession by the President of Costa Rica for a period of

ten years.5®' Costa Rica continued to advance the Crucitas Project, including when the
Project encountered obstacles.5©

Having obtained an exploitation concession, the Claimant argues that it expected to be
allowed to build and operate the Crucitas mine, and to sell the gold and other minerals
fromthe mine, provided that it received the required environmental approvals. At the
time when it invested in Costa Rica, it never envisaged that this right could or would be
taken away by a moratorium on open-pit gold mining. 5&

According to the Claimant, it was not concerned that the Crucitas Project would be
affected by President Pacheco’s 2002 Moratorium, because that Moratorium exempted
from its application projects with acquired rights.5* It adds that it would not have
invested in the Project if its right to an exploitation concession and such concession
itself could be revoked at any time. This expectation was reinforced by Costa Rica’s
Political Constitution, which declares that “[n]o law shall have retroactive effect in
prejudice to any person, or to his acquired patrimonial rights or to any consolidated
legal situations.” 5 It was equally strengthened by unambiguous representations by the
Government. The Claimant stresses in particular that in 2002 Minister of the
Environment Rodriguez assured it that the 2002 Moratorium would not apply to the
Crucitas Project, which was also confirmed by the 2002 Constitutional Chamber
Decision.5®

Infinito thus continued to invest in the Crucitas Project, on the understanding that the
exploitation concession was valid and the 2002 Moratorium did not apply. It could not
have expected, so it says, that through a complex series of judicial decisions and
Government action and inaction, Costa Rica would end up retroactively applying the
2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project, “nine years after it was decreed and three
years after it was repealed.”5°7

The Claimant further contends that its expectation was bolstered by the Government's
continued acts in support of the Crucitas Project, even after the Constitutional Chamber
annulled the resolution granting Industrias Infinito’s exploitation concession in 2004.
For the Claimant, these actions in favor of the Crucitas Project included the following:5®8

DGM, MINAE, the Minister of the Environment and Energy, the President of Costa Rica

and the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, among others — worked to
advance the Crucitas project through the administrative process.”5°9

The Claimant also contends that it relied on the Government to apply Costa Rican law
correctly, and indeed, that it was entitled to rely on the validity of the Government's own
acts through the Costa Rican law principle of legitimate expectations (confianza
legitima) and the Government's obligation to direct the administrative process (impulso
de oficio). Infinito could not have known that the 2002 Moratorium “secretly applied” to
the Project, when the Government itself considered that it did not apply. 5”°

Itis the Claimant's submission that its expectations were objectively reasonable, which
“must be assessed through contemporaneous understanding at the time the
investment was made, not hindsight reinterpretation.”5”1 Applying this test, it was
reasonable to expect that:

a. Infinito would be entitled to proceed in accordance with the administrative process
under the Mining Code.

b. The Government would apply Costa Rican law correctly and grant Industrias
Infinito valid permits.

c. If there were issues to be resolved, Industrias Infinito would have an opportunity to
remedy those deficiencies, especially if they were the result of Government
errors. 572

In response to the Respondent's argument that Infinito could have no expectation that
the judiciary would not declare the exploitation concession invalid, the Claimant clarifies
that its expectation was not that the judiciary would not find fault with a “manifestly
illegal” act; it was that the Government would apply its own law correctly, would treat
Infinito in accordance with the Mining Code, and that its approvals would not be
rendered invalid years later on the basis of the 2002 Moratorium when multiple arms of
the Government had assured Infinito that such Moratorium was not applicable.°”3

The Claimant further submits that the Government is liable for granting defective
permits, a defect which Infinito only discovered with the 2010 TCA Decision.5”4 The
Claimant stresses that it was the Arias administration which selected the conversién
mechanism, although Industrias Infinito had requested it to carry out a “convalidation”
proceeding.575

For the Claimant, whether or not the Administrative Chamber properly applied Costa
Rican law or properly annulled the resolution granting the exploitation concessionis not
determinative of Costa Rica’s FET obligation. Relying on Arif and SPP, the Claimant
submits that the Respondent cannot rely on its own internal law to justify an
internationally wrongful act, and thus cannot point to the judiciary’s decisions to avoid
international responsibility.5”°

Infinito claims that, through the following measures, the Respondent frustrated its
legitimate expectations and treated it in an arbitrary and inconsistent manner:

a. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which partially confirmed the 2010
TCA Decision, “thereby rendering final and irreversible the annulment of the
exploitation concession, environmental approvals, the declaration of public interest
and national convenience, and the land use change permit.”57”

b. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which declined to resolve the conflict
between its earlier decision upholding the constitutionality of the Crucitas Project
approvals and the 2010 TCA Decision.578

c. The 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, which prohibited open-pit mining indefinitely
save for those holding exploitation concessions, and thus prevented Industrias
Infinito from applying for new permits. 5”9

d. The 2012 MINAET Resolution, which cancelled the 2008 Concession and
expunged all of Industrias Infinito’s mining rights from the mining registry, going
further than what was ordered by the Administrative Chamber. 58°

According to the Claimant, the “combined effect’ of these measures violated the FET
standard, 5*' with the result that Industrias Infinito was “left without any rights, or any
opportunity to fix the defects identified by the Administrative Chamber and obtain new
rights.”582

For the Claimant, it is crucial to emphasize that “the fate of the Crucitas Project was
enabled by the decision of the Administrative Chamber, but the end result was the

choice of the Government of Costa Rica.”583 As a consequence, “the end result was
the Government's policy choice” which “was not preordained or required, and was
inconsistent with the Government's preceding conduct.”584

More specifically, the Claimant makes the following submissions with respect to the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision:

a. Before the 2010 TCA Decision, there was never any suggestion that the 2002
Moratorium applied to the Project. Hence, its application in the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision breached the Claimant’s legitimate expectations that the
Crucitas Project would proceed in conformity with the Mining Code and that the
Government would act consistently, transparently and in accordance with its own
law correctly. 585

b. Costa Rica’s argument that it was evident that the 2002 Moratorium applied since
2004 relies on hindsight and is not credible considering the Govemment's conduct
between 2004 and 2010.58

c. Had the 2002 Moratorium applied to the Crucitas Project in 2002, it would have
violated Costa Rica’s FET obligation, as it would have eviscerated the legal
framework upon which Infinito was induced to invest. The Administrative
Chamber's application of the 2002 Moratorium nine years later is no less a
breach. 58”

d. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision applied the 2002 Moratorium to the
Crucitas Project even though that Moratorium had been repealed by the
Government in March 2008. The application of the 2002 Moratorium to the Project
served no rational purpose and was thus arbitrary and in breach of the FET
standard.58

e. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision also breaches FET for failing to treat
Infinito consistently and in a predictable manner. The Administrative Chamber
applied the 2002 Moratorium years after Infinito made a substantial investment and
contradicted various decisions of the Constitutional Chamber and _ specific
commitments of other arms of the State. 589

Following the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the Claimant alleges that Costa
Rica’s FET breach culminated through the combined effect of such Decision, the 2011
Legislative Mining Ban, the 2012 MINAET Resolution, the 2013 Constitutional Chamber

Decision, and the Chinchilla Government's inaction. 5°° Costa Rica simply “wash[ed] its
hands” of the Crucitas Project.5®' In this context, Infinito submits that Article IV of the
BIT allows the Tribunal to import the standard found in the Costa Rica-France BIT that
requires the State to do “what is necessary” to protect Infinito’s investments. However,
Costa Rica did nothing to address the unfair manner in which Infinito was treated .592

With respect to the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, the Claimant emphasizes that,
contrary to previous moratoria, the Ban was permanent, it cancelled all pending
proceedings (rather than suspending them), and prohibited the renewal or extension of
all exploitation concessions in perpetuity.59° The Claimant characterizes the 2011
Legislative Mining Ban as an “unprecedented change in the applicable legal framework”
that violated its legitimate expectations. 5% It also submits that the choice to change the
regime previously enshrined in the Mining Code by prohibiting the grant of any further
exploitation concessions was arbitrary, capricious, and lacked transparency. 55

The Claimant further contends that there was no rational purpose for applying the 2011
Legislative Mining Ban to the Crucitas Project. There is no evidence, so says the
Claimant, that the Crucitas Project threatened the environment or biodiversity. To the
contrary, the Project had obtained all environmental permits and was found to be
environmentally sound by the Constitutional Chamber.5°°

As to the 2012 MINAET Resolution, the Claimant asserts that it went beyond what was
ordered by the Administrative Chamber and cancelled all of Industrias Infinito’s pre-
existing mining rights, striking them from the Mining Registry. The Claimant speculates
that “[t]his was likely done pursuant to the terms of the 2011 [L]egislative [M]ining [B]an,
which unlike prior moratoria, required that all administrative processes under the Mining
Code without a valid exploitation concession be archived.”5*” The Claimant also
contends that this cancellation served no rational purpose and was thus arbitrary. 59°

Finally, the Claimant submits that Costa Rica did transform the legal and business
environment of the investment.59 When Infinito purchased Industrias Infinito in 2000,
it relied on the Government's support for mining investment and on the Mining Code.®°
Starting with the 2002 Moratorium, Costa Rica eviscerated the legal framework under

the Mining Code that formed the basis of Infinito’s investment, through changes to laws
and judicial decisions. In 2011, the Administrative Chamber annulled the resolutions
granting Infinito’s key permits and approvals on novel grounds.®"

Infinito, so it says, was then prevented from remedying any of the defects identified by
the Administrative Chamber by the operation of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. The
Claimant emphasizes that “[i]t is impossible to see these changes as anything other
than a complete repudiation of the statutory scheme underlying Infinito’s investment
that made it impossible for the Crucitas [P]roject to proceed.”

The Claimant further asserts that Costa Rica’s unfair and inequitable treatment towards
its investments has not stopped with the measures challenged in this arbitration. It
recalls that, in 2015, the TCA ordered Industrias Infinito, SINAC and the Government
to pay to return the Crucitas site to its pre-project state. This decision, which was
contrary to the Constitutional Chamber’s conclusion that Industrias Infinito’s activities
posed no environmental risk, was overturned by the Administrative Chamber and
remitted back to the TCA in December 2017.®5

The Claimant stresses that, two weeks before the filing of the Reply, Costa Rica re-
initiated this dormant proceeding.®® For the Claimant, “[t]he continuation of this
proceeding continues Costa Rica’s breach of the fair and equitable standard, and any
damages and costs (including defence costs) associated with this proceeding are
further damages to Infinito resulting from that breach.”®°” Indeed, a reasonable court
could not hold Industrias Infinito liable to pay to return the site to its pre-project state,
given that the site has been harmed by illegal mining and hurricane Otto in 2016.98

Accordingly, the Claimant requests “a declaration that Costa Rica is liable to indemnify
Infinito for any amounts Infinito or [Industrias Infinito] are required to pay as a result of,
or in connection with, this late-blooming proceeding.” ®9

(ii) Costa Rica Denied Infinito Justice

It is the Claimant's further submission that Costa Rica committed a denial of justice by
failing to provide a legal systemcapable of protecting its investments. More specifically,
it argues that Infinito was denied procedural and substantive justice. °'°

First, Infinito complains about a procedural denial of justice, which in its words “is
caused by systemic issues with the operation of a justice system ‘as a whole’,”®"" that
is “not by the ‘aberrant decision by a lower official,’ but rather from the lack of a
‘reasonably available national mechanism to correct the challenged action,’ when
appellate proceedings are ‘dysfunctional,’ or because ‘a failure of ajudicial system [...]
is not capable of being rectified by existing remedies’.”12

For the Claimant, the elements of a procedural denial of justice are met here. The Costa
Rican court system failed, because it resulted in two fundamentally inconsistent
decisions from two different Chambers of the same Supreme Court.®'3 The
Administrative Chamber failed to respect the Constitutional Chamber's Decisions,
which had res judicata and erga omnes effects, and Costa Rica’s judicial system
provided no mechanism to resolve this conflict.®"4

More particularly, the Claimant argues that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision
is inconsistent with previous decisions of the Constitutional Chamber declaring that
Industrias Infinito obtained the Concession in compliance with Costa Rican law:

a. In 2002, the Constitutional Chamber held that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply
to the Crucitas Project. ®5

b. In 2004, the Constitutional Chamber held that the Crucitas Project could proceed
through the EIA approval process. ®6

c. In 2007, the Constitutional Chamber determined that it only required approval of
the EIA in order for the Concession to be granted to Industrias Infinito.°"”

d. In 2010, the Constitutional Chamber upheld the Concession and the related
approvals on the ground that the Project was constitutional and lawful. °"®

The Claimant argues that the emergence of such conflict between decisions of the
Supreme Court was enabled by the creation of the TCA in 2008.°"9 Prior to the TCA’s
creation, persons with diffuse interests could only challenge the constitutionality of
administrative acts before the Constitutional Chamber. Thereafter, they could also
proceed before administrative courts. The Claimant accepts that it was able to seek a
declaration from the Constitutional Chamber that the 2010 TCA Decision was
unconstitutional. However, when the Administrative Chamber upheld the 2010 TCA
Decision, the Constitutional Chamber rejected that action as inadmissible. °° At that
stage, there was no mechanism to resolve the conflict between the Constitutiond
Chamber and the Administrative Chamber’s confirmation of the 2010 TCA Decision.

Relying on Dan Cake, the Claimant asserts that “[t]he absence of any reasonably
available further recourse against the Court order is such that, in the circumstances of
this case, the breakdown must be treated as ‘systemic’.”®21

Second, the Claimant contends that it was denied substantive justice because the
Administrative Chamber incorrectly applied the 2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas
Project.°2? For the Claimant, the Administrative Chamber incurred in a “gross and
wrongful error’ by applying the 2002 Moratorium to the Concession. Indeed, the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision annulled the Concession despite the fact that (i) the
Costa Rican Constitution prohibits the retroactive application of laws, (ii) the 2002
Moratorium expressly provided that it did not apply to any right acquired before its
publication, (iii) the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision annulled the Concession on
a relative (rather than an absolute) basis and “without prejudice to the findings of the
Environmental Impact Study,” and (iv) the Constitutional Chamber declared in several
decisions that the Crucitas Project complied with Costa Rican law.®

The Claimant explains that any “inappropriate and egregious” misapplication of Costa
Rican law amounts to a denial of justice.®4 It also submits that the retroactive

application of laws can constitute a denial of justice, particularly when the new law
amounts to a repudiation of the pre-existing legal framework. Invoking Bilcon, the
Claimant argues that “breaches of the international minimum standard might arise in
some special circumstances — such as changes in a legal or policy framework that
have retroactive effect, are not proceeded by reasonable notice, are aimed or applied
in a discriminatory basis or are contrary to earlier specific assurances by state
authorities that the regulatory framework would not be altered to the detriment of the
investor.”®5 In the same vein, the tribunal in ATA held that the retroactive application
of Jordan’s arbitration law by local courts violated the State’s international obligations
towards the investor. °26

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that there has been no breach of legitimate expectations (i),
nor have Costa Rica’s actions otherwise breached FET (ii). Itfurther contends that there
has been no denial of justice (iii).

(i) There Was No Breach of Legitimate Expectations

The Respondent argues that, even if legitimate expectations were protected by Article
Il(2)(a) of the BIT, Costa Rica has not breached any of the Claimant's legitimate
expectations. The Respondent's argument is essentially that the Claimant's
expectations were neither legitimate nor reasonable (a);°*” and the challenged
measures did not breach any of the Claimant’s expectations (b). 628

a. The Claimant's Expectations Were Neither Legitimate Nor
Reasonable

The Respondent submits that neither the legal framework established by the Mining
Code at the time of the Claimant’s investment nor the Government's support for
investment in the mining sector amount to specific assurances or promises to the
investor that could constitute the basis for any legitimate expectation.®2° To the extent
that the Claimant relies on statements by Government officials, these statements (i)
were not directly addressed to the Claimant or to Industrias Infinito; (ii) were not
specific; and (iii) did not relate to the Crucitas Mining Project. 6°

With respect to the Claimant's alleged expectation that it would obtain an exploitation
concession and be able to operate the Crucitas Project, the Respondent argues that

the Claimant is misrepresenting the Mining Code.®*" First, an exploration permit holder
is not automatically entitled to obtain an exploitation concession, as expressly
confirmed by the TCA.®2 Second, Article 61 of the Mining Code does not provide an
exhaustive list of the grounds to cancel or invalid a concession. °°? Third, relying on the
Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence and on Dr. Leén’s expert
report, the Respondent stresses that the approval of the EIA is a pre-condition for
obtaining an exploitation concession since 1993. 634

The Respondent further denies that the Claimant or any investor “could have held a
legitimate expectation that Costa Rica’s environmental regulations and policies would
remain static.”®5 Relying on Micula, the Respondent submits that absent a stabilization
clause or other specific assurance, an investor can have no legitimate expectation that
the legal framework will not be modified after the establishment of the investment.®°
Indeed, even before the Claimant made its investment, the Costa Rican environmental
legal framework was evolving. °°”

The Respondent disputes that Costa Rica’s conduct bolstered the Claimant's
expectation to carry out the Crucitas Project. Infinito “could and should have been
aware that in a rule of law State such as Costa Rica, permits and concession licenses
granted by the executive branch must be in accordance with the law and are not
shielded or immune from legal challenge from third parties.” 8

According to the Respondent, Costa Rica has never stated or suggested that the 2002
Moratorium would not apply to the Project. First, the Claimant's argument that Minister
of the Environment Rodriguez represented in 2002 that the 2002 Moratoriumwould not
apply to the Crucitas Project is not supported by any evidence. In any event, the
Minister could not have made any statement at such time with respect to the 2008
Concession.®9 Second, the amparo requests filed before the Constitutional Chamber
did not involve the Claimant but unrelated companies and the decision did not “verify,
analyse or validate the process by which Industrias Infinito obtained the [2002]
concession or the legality thereof.”*4° The Respondent further denies that the 2010 TCA
Decision applied the 2002 Moratorium retroactively to the Concession, since the

Claimant had no vested right following the annulment ab initio of the 2002
Concession. ®41

Further, the Respondent denies that the Claimant's alleged expectations would have
been bolstered by the Government's continued acts to advance the Crucitas Project
even when the Project encountered hurdles. The Respondent argues that “the
Executive never represented to the Claimant — nor is the Claimant alleging that it did -
that (i) the mining concession was exempt from the law or from judicial scrutiny, and (ii)
that the judiciary would confirm the legality or rubber stamp the measures adopted by
the Executive, including the 2008 Concession.” &42

The Respondent contends that the Claimant cannot rely on the Constitutiona
Chamber's judgments from 2007 and 2010 as a basis to its expectation that the 2008
Concession was valid. The Constitutional Chamber declared in its decisions that the
Administrative Chamber was the only competent court to rule on the legality of
administrative acts such as the 2008 Concession. Accordingly, the Respondent
concludes that “there is no court judgment or other pronouncement from any Costa
Rican Court that the Claimant can invoke that would have given rise to a legitimate
expectation.” 643

Finally, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s reliance on the Costa Rican legal
concepts of confianza legitima and impulso de oficio is not material in the present case.
The first principle requires the applicant to have acted in good faith, which is not the
case here since the Claimant misled the Costa Rican administration to obtain the 2008
Concession. In turn, the impulso de oficio concept is not a guarantee or insurance
policy. The Claimant could not expect under this concept that the Executive’s decisions
would be free from any legal defect.®4+

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant's expectations were not objectively
reasonable, for the following reasons:

a. First, the 2008 Concession was clearly not valid.65 As a result, the Claimant “could
not reasonably expect, either at the time that it made its investment or at any other
time, that the Concession and related permits would be immune from judicial
review and not subject to annulment.”®4°

b. Second, the Claimant could not reasonably have expected that the 2008
Concession would be exempt from defects and judicial review, since it had already

had a similar experience with its 2002 Concession, which the Constitution
Chamber annulled in 2004.°4”

c. Third, the Claimant could not reasonably have expected the Executive to ignore
the rulings of the CostaRican courts; it could only have expected that the Executive
would defend the legality of Industrias Infinito’s rights in the administrative
proceedings. The Claimant does not dispute that the Executive did so. 4®

d. Fourth, the Respondent recalls that, even during the Arias’ administration, there
was fierce opposition to open-pit mining and legal challenges to Industrias Infinito's
Concession. *49

e. Finally, the Respondent stresses that the Claimant misled the Costa Rican
administration and thus cannot invoke the confianza legitima principle. *©°

b. The Respondent’s Measures Did Not Breach Any Legitimate
Expectation

The Respondent submits that none of the four measures challenged by the Claimant,
analyzed either individually or together, violated the Claimant's legitimate expectations.

First, the Respondent submits that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision did not
frustrate the Claimant's expectation that the Crucitas Project would be allowed to
proceed through the administrative process set out under the Mining Code.*®' The
Respondent further emphasizes that “[i]f the Costa Rican courts annul a permit or
concession because it contradicts Costa Rican law, as they did in this case, this cannot
be considered as an inconsistent treatment in breach of the investor’s legitimate
expectations” and that “[t]his merely reflects the proper operation of an independent
judiciary.” 652

Second, the Respondent claims that a measure can only breach an investors
legitimate expectations, if it has transformed the legal and business environment
existing at the time of the investment.®° According to the Respondent, none of the
challenged measures had the effect of transforming the legal and business
environment in which the investment was made:

a. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision only confirmed the 2010 TCA
Decision, ®4 and did not reinterpret the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision, as

the Claimant asserts. The Constitutional Chamber annulled the 2002 Concession
because it was unconstitutional, but did not rule on the legality of the Concession,
since issues of compliance with administrative law fall outside its jurisdiction. ®5

b. The 2011 Legislative Mining Ban had no impact on the Claimant, since the 2010
Executive Moratoria already prevented Industrias Infinito from acquiring new
mining rights. °°

c. The 2012 MINAET Resolution simply implemented the orders of the 2010 TCA
Decision.”

d. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision simply rejected Industrias Infinito's
constitutionality challenge on procedural grounds. 8

(ii) The Challenged Measures are not Arbitrary, Unreasonable, or
Otherwise Contrary to FET

According to the Respondent, none of the challenged measures have otherwise
breached Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.

Starting with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the Respondent argues that
it did not treat the Claimant in an arbitrary, unreasonable, grossly unfair, unjust,
discriminatory or disproportionate manner.®©° The TCA applied the 2002 Moratorium to
Industrias Infinito on the basis of an in-depth, reasonable and fair analysis and objective
assessment of all the evidence relating to the legality of the Concession. More
specifically, the TCA found that Industrias Infinito lost any right related to the Crucitas
Project as a result of the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision which annulled the
2002 Concession, and thus that it had no “acquired right” within the meaning of the
grandfathering provision provided in the 2002 Moratorium. ®*' The Respondent further
contends that the Claimant “could and should have expected that the 2002 Moratorium
would apply the moment that the 2002 concession was annulled.”®? For the
Respondent, the fact that the Claimant sought to overturn the 2004 Constitutional
Chamber Decision and requested a confirmation that the annulment of the 2002
Concession was only relative shows that it was aware of the impact of the 2004
Constitutional Chamber Decision on its rights. °°

Further, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision did not treat the Claimant's
investments in an inconsistent and unpredictable manner, as this judgment is
consistent with the earlier decisions of the Constitutional Chamber dealing with the
Concession.* Indeed, the Constitutional Chamber stated that it had no jurisdiction
over the legality of a mining project and made no ruling on the issues brought before
the administrative courts. °°

As to the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban (which the Respondent refers to as the
“Legislative Moratorium’), it did not specifically target the Crucitas Project, but reflected
the Government's intent to prohibit an activity it deemed harmful for the environment.66
In any event, it did not have any impact on the Claimant because the 2002 Moratorium
and the 2010 Executive Moratoria had already prohibited open-pit mining from 2002 to
2010.°°7

The Respondent also challenges that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban prevented
Industrias Infinito’s from obtaining a new concession after the 2008 Concession was
annulled, because the company had already lost its right to obtain a concession when
the Ban entered into force.®®* Indeed, Industrias Infinito’s exploration permit and the
purported “pre-existing mining rights” relating to it expired in September 1999. The
Claimant is thus incorrect when it argues that, because its mining rights reverted to the
status prior to the annulment of the 2008 Concession, it could have requested anew
concession to exploit the Crucitas mine absent the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban.
Industrias Infinito no longer held any valid or pre-existing mining rights when the 2008
Concession was annulled in November 2010. °°

Contrary to the Claimant’s contentions, the application of the 2011 Legislative Mining
Ban and its implementation through the 2012 MINAET Resolution were premised on a
rational purpose. The challenges filed against Industrias Infinito’s concessions as well
as the bans on open-pit mining were all motivated by environmental concerns. In any
event, the Respondent submits that “Costa Rica is not required to prove in this
proceeding that the Claimant's project would have caused harm; what Costa Rica has
to demonstrate is that Costa Rican Courts applied the laws and regulations
correctly.”®7°

The Respondent also advances that the 2012 MINAET Resolution was not contrary to
FET. The Claimant could not expect the MINAET to ignore the 2010 TCA Decision and
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision by refusing to cancel the Concession and
extinguish the related mining rights. The executive branch made its best efforts within

the limits of its powers, namely it actively supported Industrias Infinito through the legal
proceedings before the Costa Rican courts.”

With regard to the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, the Respondent argues that
the Claimant “has not even attempted to explain how [this decision] allegedly breached
the fair and equitable treatment standard” and that “[nJeither the Claimant nor its Costa
Rican legal experts have claimed that the 2013 Constitutional Chamber [Decision] was
wrong as a matter of Costa Rican law, let alone that it constitutes denial of justice under
international law, or even that it is grossly or manifestly arbitrary or unfair.”®’? The
Claimant “cannot allege any procedural impropriety, legal unreasonableness or
arbitrariness on the part of the Constitutional Chamber” when it issued that decision. In
any event, the premise of the claim against this judgment-— that the 2010 TCA Decision
contradicted earlier findings by the Constitutional Chamber — is flawed, because there
was no such contradiction.®”>

The Respondent submits that, even taken together, the challenged measures did not
breach Article |I(2)(a) of the BIT. For Costa Rica, the Claimant has failed to argue or
prove a creeping violation of the FET standard through a composite breach.®” In
particular, it has failed to show that “the relevant measures constitute a pattern or
system seeking an intended purpose.””5

Finally, with respect to the fifth measure challenged by the Claimant, the Respondent
denies that the reopening of the TCA Damages Proceeding amounts to a breach of
FET. As there is to date no judicial measure requiring Industrias Infinito to pay any
compensation, the Claimant's claim is premature and manifestly without legal merit.°”°
The Respondent notes that the Claimant's new claim arises from a remand notice
related to the TCA Damages Proceeding. However, the Claimant has not alleged that
it has suffered loss or damage as a result of the remand notice. The Respondent argues
that “[t]he Claimant is not arguing that the mere initiation of the TCA Damages
Proceeding constitutes an internationally wrongful act;” “[i]t is attempting to bring a
claim for potential losses even though such losses may never arise.”°’” In the
Respondent’s submission, “[t]he Tribunal cannot determine at present whether a future
judicial decision by a Costa Rican court will constitute a breach Article II(2)(a) of the
BIT.”678

The Respondent further denies that the present case can be compared to Chevron Il,
in which the tribunal granted the investor declaratory relief similar to the one sought

here. This is because in Chevron II, the relief related to ajudicial decision for damages
that had already been issued against it.°”°

(iii) | There Has Been No Denial of Justice

The Respondent asserts that it has not denied the Claimant justice. The threshold for
determining a denial of justice is high and goes far beyond the mere misapplication of
domestic law. °° Relying on Azinian and Pantechniki, the Respondent submits that “[a]
denial of justice could be pleaded if the relevant courts refuse to entertain a suit, if they
subject it to undue delay, or if they administer justice in a seriously inadequate way”®51
and that “the error must be of akind which no ‘competent judge could reasonably have
made.’”662

The Respondent stresses that mere allegations that a judicial decision is improper are
not enough to constitute a breach of denial of justice, unless it is also shown that the
decision was “clearly inappropriate or ignominious.”®83 To demonstrate that Costa Rica
denied it justice, the Claimant must establish that “the judicial measures that it
challenges constitute a systemic failure of Costa Rica’s domestic justice system as a
whole, a manifest injustice or gross unfairness, aflagrant and inexcusable violation in
which bad faith, not judicial error, seems to be the heart of the matter and that there
has been a failure of the judicial system as a whole.” 4

According to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to meet this test. There has been
neither a procedural (i) nor a substantive denial of justice (ii).

a. There Has Been No Procedural Denial of Justice

The Respondent submits that there has been no procedural denial of justice. More
specifically, it denies that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is inconsistent
with the decisions issued by the Constitutional Chamber in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2010,
or that the Costa Rican judicial system failed to resolve that alleged inconsistency.

a. First, there is no inconsistency with the Constitutional Chamber’s decisions in April
and August of 2010, because the Constitutional Chamber did not rule on the
legality of the Crucitas Project; it limited itself to ruling on its constitutionality.
Indeed, “the Constitutional Chamber itself acknowledged in its decisions of April

and August 2010 [that] it did not have competence to rule definitively on the legality
of the [P]roject, since this was a matter which would fall within the competence of
the Administrative branch of the judiciary.”®85 As a result, the Claimant's arguments
that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision breached the res judicata principle
and rendered a decision that was inconsistent with the 2010 Constitutiona
Chamber decisions is baseless.*° Industrias Infinito had already raised these
arguments when it challenged the 2010 TCA Decision, and the Administrative
Chamber expressly rejected them in its 2011 Decision. °°”

b. Second, there is no inconsistency with the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision,
because the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision assessed the legality of the
2008 Concession, while the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision annulled the
2002 Concession. °°

c. Third, there is no inconsistency with the 2002 Constitutional Chamber Decision,
because the Constitutional Chamber did not pronounce on the legality of the 2002
Concession or on the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium. ®°

According to the Respondent, “[i]n making its allegations of inconsistency, the Claimant
betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the Costa Rican court system.” 6° The
Respondent explains that each Chamber of Costa Rica’s Supreme Court has it owns
area of competence. In the cases at issue, both the Administrative Chamber and the
Constitutional Chamber addressed the issue of their competence and concluded that
there was no conflict between their rulings in relation to the Crucitas Project because
“[e]ach Chamber ruled on the basis of its separate jurisdiction, and explicitly recognized
and respected the other Chamber’s jurisdiction.”®' Further, the Respondent stresses
that the Claimant raised these arguments beforethe Costa Rican courts, which rejected
them. 692

Finally, the Respondent denies that CostaRica should be liable because the Claimant's
challenge before the Constitutional Chamber was rendered moot when the
Administrative Chamber issued its decision. The Respondent argues that “[b]y initiating
its constitutional review petition only 19 days before the 2011 Administrative Chamber

Constitutional Chamber from addressing the petition on the merits.”®5

b. There Has Been No Substantive Denial of Justice

The Respondent further submits that there has been no substantive denial of justice.
In particular, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision did not retroactively apply the
2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project, as the Claimant maintains.®°4 The Supreme
Court merely upheld the 2010 TCA Decision, which found that the 2008 Concession
had been granted in breach of the 2002 Moratorium.®5 The Administrative Chamber
did not apply the 2002 Moratorium retroactively, since it was in effect when the 2008
Concession was granted.®°

The Respondent further contends that the Claimant has not shown any illegitimate
conduct on the part of the CostaRican courts that would amount to a denial of justice.°9”
In particular, the Claimant has made no allegations of corruption, improper influence or
bias by any of the judges that rendered these decisions. ®°° Accordingly, “the Claimant's
claims amount to a mere disagreement by the Claimant with Costa Rican domestic
court decisions, and their application of domestic law to the facts.”®°9 Relying on the
Tribunal’s finding that “it is not its role to act as a court of appeal with respect to
decisions of domestic courts,”’°° the Respondent concludes that the Claimant's
arguments do not meet the high threshold to establish the existence of a denial of
justice. 70"

c. Analysis

The Tribunal will assess whether the Respondent denied Infinito justice (i) or otherwise
treated Infinito unfairly and inequitably, including by deceiving legitimate expectations,
and by treatment that was arbitrary or inconsistent (ii).

(i) Did the Respondent Deny Justice to the Claimant?

a. The Standard for Denial of Justice

While the BIT does not expressly refer to the concept of denial of justice, the Parties
agree — and rightly so — that it is comprised in the FET standard provided in
Article 1I(2)(a) of the BIT.’°? The authorities are unanimous in that a denial of justice
amounts to a breach of fair and equitable treatment. 7°

Different authors endorse varying definitions of denial of justice. Some submit that a
denial of justice can be procedural (when it relates to lack of access to justice or
breaches of due process) or substantive (when it involves a manifestly unfair judgment
or the malicious misapplication of the law).”°4 For Brownlie,’ for instance, the best
guide to defining the concept of denial of justice is the Harvard Research Draft, which
provides: 706

Denial of justice exists when there is a denial, unwarranted delay or
obstruction of access to courts, gross deficiency in the administration of
judicial or remedial process, failure to provide those guarantees which are
generally considered indispensable to the proper administration of justice,
ora manifestly unjustjudgment. An error of anational courtwhich does not
produce manifest injustice is not a denial of justice.

For others, like Paulsson, “[dJenial of justice is always procedural,” because its
objective is to ensure that foreigners are afforded “procedural fairness” as measured
by an international standard.’°” Accordingly, ahost State commits a denial of justice if
it “administers justice to aliens in a fundamentally unfair manner.”7°8 Complaints against

the substance of a decision may amount to other breaches of the treaty, but are not
denials of justice.’

For Douglas, the better view lies somewhere in between: while he agrees that denials
of justice are essentially procedural, he argues that a theory of procedural fairness must
be linked to substantive rights and outcomes, as the purpose of the judicial system is
to decide cases and generate good outcomes. 7'°

A review of investment arbitration decisions shows similar fluctuations. Some tribunas
have considered that a denial of justice involves a failure of procedure and have
accepted that a manifestly unfair outcome may be indicative of a procedural failure. For
instance, the Loewen tribunal defined denial of justice as a “[mlanifest injustice in the
sense of alack of due process leading to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial
propriety.”’"' Citing Fitzmaurice and de Visscher, Pantechniki articulated this point
further:

The general rule is that ‘mere error in the interpretation of the national law
does not per se involve responsibility.’ Wrongful application of the law may
nonetheless provide ‘elements of proof of a denial of justice.’ But that
requires an extreme test: the error must be of a kind which no ‘competent
judge could reasonably have made.’ Such a finding would mean that the
state had not provided even a minimally adequate justice system.”

The Liman tribunal endorsed a similar view:

[T]he Tribunal concludes that Respondent can only be held liable for denial
of justice if Claimants are able to prove that the court system fundamentally
failed. Such failure is mainly to be held established in cases of major
procedural errors such as lack of due process. The substantive outcome
of acase can be relevant as an indication of lack of due process and thus
can be considered as an element to prove denial of justice.”°

Other tribunals have favored a broader view in which a denial of justice may also be
caused by the substance of the judgment, along the lines of the Harvard Research Draft
quoted above. For instance, the tribunal in Azinian held that “[a] denial of justice could
be pleaded if the relevant courts refuse to entertain a suit, if they subject it to undue
delay, or if they administer justice in a seriously inadequate way” and noted that, in
addition, “[t]here is a fourth type of denial of justice, namely the clear and malicious

misapplication of the law.””'4 More recently, the tribunal in /berdrola summed up the
concept of denial of justice as follows:

[U]nder international law a denial of justice could constitute: (i) the
unjustified refusal of a tribunal to hear a matter within its competence or
any other State action having the effect of preventing access to justice; (ii)
undue delay in the administration of justice; and (iii) the decisions or
actions of State bodies that are evidently arbitrary, unfair, idiosyncratic or
delayed.7°

In these latter cases, the tribunals have insisted that the substantive unfairness of the
decision must be egregious. For the Azinian tribunal, the evidence for the domestic
court’s finding must be “so insubstantial, or so bereft of a basis in law” as to conclude
that “the judgments were in effect arbitrary or malicious.””'° The /berdrola tribuna
added that “denial of justice is nota mere error in interpretation of locallaw, butan error
that no merely competent judge could have committed and that shows that a minimally
adequate system of justice has not been provided.”’'” For the Mondev tribunal, the
applicable test was:

[W]hether, at an international level and having regard to generally
accepted standards of the administration of justice, a tribunal can conclude
in the light of all the available facts that the impugned decision was clearly
improper and discreditable.”®

From the authorities cited above, the Tribunal concludes that a denial of justice occurs
when there is a fundamental failure in the host’s State’s administration of justice. The
following elements can lead to this conclusion (i) the State has denied the investor
access to domestic courts; (ii) the courts have engaged in unwarranted delay; (iii) the
courts have failed to provide those guarantees which are generally considered
indispensable to the proper administration of justice (such as the independence and
impartiality of judges, due process and the right to be heard); or (iv) the decision is
manifestly arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic. The Tribunal thus concludes that a denial
of justice may be procedural or substantive, and that in both situations the denial of
justice is the product of a systemic failure of the host State’s judiciary taken as a
whole.7'? The latter point explains that a claim for denial of justice presupposes the
exhaustion of local remedies, a requirement that is met here as the complaint targets
decisions of the highest courts.

b. Did the Respondent Commit a Procedural Denial of Justice?

As explained in Section V.D.3.b(ii)b supra, the Claimant submits that its denial of justice
claim is “structural”: itis premised on the Costa Rican judicial system’s failure to provide
a mechanism to solve contradictions between the various chambers of the Supreme
Court on questions of constitutional cosa juzgada.’° More precisely, the Claimant
asserts that it has experienced a procedural denial of justice because (i) the
Administrative Chamber failed to comply with the res judicata and erga omnes effects
of prior decisions of the Constitutional Chamber, and (ii) the Costa Rican judicial system
lacked a mechanism to resolve these inconsistent decisions.’*' This was confirmed
when the Constitutional Chamber dismissed the Claimant's action to declare the 2010
TCA Decision unconstitutional on admissibility grounds (through the 2013
Constitutional Chamber Decision).

The Respondent objects to the Claimant's position on the ground that its premise is
false. More specifically, Costa Rica contends that the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision is consistent with the Constitutional Chamber’s decisions because the latter
has never assessed the Concession’s legality, ithas only assessed whether it complied
with the relevant constitutional standards. The Respondent notes that Industrias Infinito
raised the same arguments on res judicata before the TCA and the Administrative
Chamber, both of which heard and dismissed them. As to the 2013 Constitutiond
Chamber Decision, the Respondent explains that “the extraordinary constitutiona
review petition [...] must relate to another ongoing proceeding because the
Constitutional Chamber cannot enjoin a proceeding that has already been
completed.”’22 According to the Respondent, “[bly initiating its constitutional review
petition only 19 days before the 2011 Administrative Chamber Judgment was rendered,
Industrias Infinito itself made it impossible for the Constitutional Chamber [to] address[]
the petition on the merits.”725

(i) Is the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision Inconsistent
with Previous Decisions of the Constitutional Chamber?

The Claimant argues that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is inconsistent
with previous decisions by the Constitutional Chamber where the latter allegedly
declared that the Crucitas Project complied with Costa Rican law. ’4

The Tribunal understands that this is the factual premise for the Claimant’s procedura
denial of justice claim. The Tribunal understands that the Claimant is not arguing that
the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision amounts to a procedural denial of justice
because the decisions of the Administrative Chamber and the Constitutional Chamber
were allegedly inconsistent; its argument is that there is no mechanism to resolve the

more specifically, to ensure that the non-constitutional courts will recognize the res
judicata and erga omnes effects of previous decisions of the Constitutional Chamber.725
As the Claimant puts it, “Infinito has suffered a denial of justice because of an
institutional failure rooted in the design of Costa Rica’s court system — the creation of
separate arms of the judiciary with overlapping jurisdiction, each with diffuse rights of
standing, without a mechanism for resolving the conflicting decisions of the
Constitutional Chamber and the Administrative Chamber.” 726

The Claimant directs its argument against the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision,
which upheld the 2010 TCA Decision. It contends that the Administrative Chamber
failed to reverse certain findings made by the TCA which directly contradicted previous
rulings of the Constitutional Chamber in the following decisions:

a. The Constitutional Chamber’s Decision of 20 August 2002, 72” which the Claimant
alleges held that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to the Crucitas Project. 72°

b. The Constitutional Chamber’s Decision of 24 November 2004, which annulled the
2002 Concession “without prejudice to what the environmental impact assessment

Tr. Merits Day 4 (ENG), 1163:8-1165-21 (Ms. Seers):

“MS. SEERS: “[...] We've said from the very beginning [...] the denial of
justice claimis structural. [...] By ‘structural,’ | mean [...] the failure of the
Costa Rican judicial order [...]to provide a mechanism to resolve the failure
by the non-Constitutional Courts to respect constitutional cosa juzgada.
[...] It's not about the failure to afford a due process. It's not about the
decisions themselves being arbitrary. We're not saying that at all. What
we are saying is that the Administrative Chamber refused to follow
constitutional — TCA first and then the Administrative Chamber by refusing
the cassation requests, refused to follow constitutional cosa juzgada. [...]

PRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: So, what you're telling us is that the
denial of justice claim is structural, which there is a lack of mechanism to
resolve conflicting situations with conflicting decisions? But then is that
what it is?

MS. SEERS: It is with one precision, if | may. Not any conflicting decision.
Failure by the non-Constitutional Courts — in this case the Administrative
Court — to follow constitutional cosa juzgada.

PRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: And so the ‘cosa juzgada’ argument
is part of your structural denial of justice claim.

may determine.”’29 In the Claimant’s view, this decision held that the Crucitas
Project could proceed through the EIA approval process. ’°°

c. The Constitutional Chamber’s Decision of 7 June 2007, 731 which according to the
Claimant determined that it only required approval of the EIA for the Concession
to be granted. 732

d. The Constitutional Chamber's Decision of 16 April 2010,7°° which upheld the
Concession and the approvals relating thereto on the ground that the Project was
constitutional and (according to the Claimant) lawful. 754

Having carefully reviewed the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision, the Tribunal does not find these decisions inconsistent with those
of the Constitutional Chamber cited above. The Tribunal has also assessed the
procedural conduct and reasoning of these courts, and concludes that they were based
on the relevant provisions of Costa Rican law and are not objectionable from the point
of view of international law.

Industrias Infinito raised the res judicata objection both with the TCA and the
Administrative Chamber. Both courts denied that objection on the ground that the
Constitutional Chamber had expressly declined its jurisdiction to entertain issues of
legality. To reach this conclusion, the TCA, in a thirteen-page-long reasoning, started
by noting that administrative and constitutional courts have different areas of
competence under Costa Rican law. It explained that the amparo proceedings
governed by Article 48 of the Costa Rican Constitution’5 and Article 29 of the
Constitutional Jurisdiction Law’ were only intended to ensure the protection of

fundamental and constitutional rights. 73” By contrast, pursuant to Article 49 of the Costa
Rican Constitution, the competence to review the legality of administrative acts lies
exclusively with the contentious-administrative courts.’°6 Furthermore, the TCA pointed
to Article 55 of the Law on Constitutional Jurisdiction, pursuant to which “the rejection
of the action for constitutional rights protection (amparo) does not prejudge the liabilities
that the offender may have incurred into[...].””°9 On this basis, the TCA concluded that,
while the dismissal of an amparo action might mean that there is no violation of
constitutional rights, it does not imply that the defendant cannot be held liable on other
grounds. 4°

The TCA then reviewed whether the Constitutional Chamber had made findings on the
2008 Concession’s legality. It observed that the Constitutional Chamber had expressly
declined jurisdiction to entertain issues relating to the legality of the Concession.”
Hence, the TCA concluded that “[t]he above shows that the Constitutional Chamber
itself was always aware of its constitutional jurisdiction and never ventured into the
scope of legality when assessing the Crucitas Mining Project, but made its assessment
from the perspective of the violation or not of the fundamental rights, which is what
proceeds in the case of an action for constitutional rights protection (amparo).””42

The TCA further remarked that “the Political Constitution makes an important distinction
between the powers assigned to the Constitutional Jurisdiction and the Contentious-
Administrative Jurisdiction. [...] This distinction within the scope of the competence of
each of the mentioned bodies is what determines the lack of identity between the object
and cause of what is heard by the Constitutional Chamber in the amparos cited and
reviewed by the Contentious-Administrative Court in this proceeding.””43 Finally, the
TCA explained that its finding was consistent with the Administrative Chamber's
jurisprudence.744

On appeal, the Administrative Chamber upheld the TCA’s decision. It stressed that the
res judicata principle “implies the prohibition to discuss, again, a controversy already
resolved by the competent jurisdictional body [...] [which] requires full coincidence
between the decided controversy and the one subsequently filed.””5 The
Administrative Chamber further explained that only decisions of the Constitutiona
Chamber setting a precedent on the interpretation of fundamental rights and
constitutional rules have erga omnes effects.’4° Relying on its own case law, the
Administrative Chamber held that the erga omnes effects of the Constitutiona
Chamber's decisions did not extend to issues of legality. 74”

The Administrative Chamber went on to compare the issues resolved by the TCA with
those resolved by the Constitutional Chamber in the decisions invoked by the
Claimant.”48 It noted in particular that the Constitutional Chamber had declared that
“[the] assess[ment and analysis of] whether a mining concession violates an executive
decree [is not a matter of constitutionality but of legality]."”9 On this basis, the
Administrative Chamber rejected Infinito’s objection in the following terms:

Thus, as the Constitutional Chamber did not assess this point as it found
that it was a question of legality, there can be no res judicata or binding
pronouncement on this matter. Now, beyond the reasons given by the TCA
to declare the nullity of the decree of national convenience and public
interest and the change in land use and felling authorization [...], the truth
is that their validity depends on the validity of the concession act [...].
Therefore, in that respect and from this perspective, there can be no res
judicata or binding effect either.”°

On this basis, the Tribunal finds that both the TCA and the Administrative Chamber
adequately assessed Industrias Infinito’s res judicata objection on the basis of the
applicable law, and that their reasoning complies with what could be expected fromany
competent judge. As the Claimant’s own experts, Messrs. Hernandez and Rojas, have
explained, the res judicata principle is intended to prevent another court from issuing a
decision on a matter on which the Constitutional Chamber has already decided.’5' The
TCA’s and the Administrative Chambers’ assessment was directed precisely at
determining whether this was so: after summarizing the parties’ positions and defining

the applicable legal standard under Costa Rican law, they reviewed the Constitutiond
Chamber's Decisions in order to determine whether they had definitively settled the
issue of the 2008 Concession’s validity. They concluded that they had not. As a matter
of procedure, the Tribunal can find no fault with either court’s conduct, nor can it find
their conclusions unreasonable.

In any event, the Tribunal has confirmed foritself that the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision is not inconsistent with the previous decisions of the Constitutional Chamber
identified by the Claimant in connection with the legality of the 2008 Concession.

The Claimant essentially argues that the Constitutional Chamber held that (i) the 2002
Moratorium did not apply to the Crucitas Project (2002 Constitutional Chamber
Decision);7* (ii) that the Crucitas Project “could proceed through the EIA approval
process” (2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision, as confirmed by the 2007
Constitutional Chamber Decision);’53 and, (iii) that the Crucitas Project was
“environmentally sound, constitutional and lawful, and upheld the exploitation
concession and all of the Project's approvals” (2010 Constitutional Chamber
Decision).”*4 The Claimant contends that, by annulling the 2008 Concession because
the 2002 Moratorium was still in force when that Concession was granted, the
Administrative Chamber rendered a decision on matters that the Constitutiond
Chamber had already settled.

The Tribunal cannot agree with the Claimant's position. The latter’s interpretation of the
Constitutional Chamber’s Decisions is at odds with their plain language.

First, the Constitutional Chamber never determined that the 2002 Moratorium did not
apply to the Crucitas Project:

a. In its 2002 Decision, the Constitutional Chamber merely found that the 2002
Moratorium did not infringe any of the petitioner’s (or Industrias Infinito’s’55)
constitutional rights because it contained a grandfathering provision to protect
vested rights.’5 In other words, the Constitutional Chamber rendered a decision

While Industrias Infinito was not a party to these proceedings, the Constitutional Chamber
expressly referred to it in its recitals as one of the potentially affected companies. Supreme

in abstracto as to the constitutionality of the 2002 Moratorium. In any event, the
Constitutional Chamber could not have assessed in 2002 whether the 2002
Moratorium applied to the 2008 Concession, which was granted several years
later.

b. Further, in its August 2010 Decision in response to the Murillo Amparo, the
Constitutional Chamber expressly declined to determine whether the 2002
Moratorium applied to the 2008 Concession, holding that “it is not a constitutiond
matter, but a matter of legality to assess whether a mining concession violates an
executive decree.”’5’ As aresult, the Constitutional Chamber declined to entertain
the applicant’s claim.”5° It follows that the Constitutional Chamber did not decide
whether the 2008 Concession had been granted in violation of the 2002
Moratorium.

Second, there is no basis to conclude that the Constitutional Chamber found that the
2002 Concession could definitely proceed through the EIA approval process. It is
undisputed that, in its 2004 Decision, the Constitutional Chamber annulled the 2002
Concession because it had been granted without a prior EIA.”°9 It is true that the
Constitutional Chamber added that this annulment was “without prejudice to what the
environmental impact assessment may determine,””°° which suggests that the
Chamber intended for the Concession to be reinstated if a positive EIA was concluded.
However, even if this was the case, it does not alter the fact that the 2002 Concession
was thereby annulled and deprived of effectiveness.

The Claimant argues that the Constitutional Chamber's “without prejudice” statement
amounted to a declaration of relative, as opposed to absolute, nullity. It contends that,
as a result, the 2002 Concession could have been cured (convalidada) and could have
continued in place, with a vested right to exploit the mine despite the 2002 Moratorium.
However, the Constitutional Chamber expressly declined its jurisdiction to specify
whether the nullity of the 2002 Concession was absolute or relative. Indeed, when
Industrias Infinito requested the Constitutional Chamber to clarify its 2004 Decision,
that Chamber (through its 2007 Decision) found that whether the approval of an EIA
could remedy the annulment of the 2002 Concession, or whether the nullity it had
declared was absolute or relative, were matters “not within the jurisdiction of this court’
because they pertained to the legality of an administrative act and were thus of the

exclusive competence of the administrative courts.’®' Specifically, the Constitutiond
Chamber stated:

I- As for determining the nature of the annulment —whether absolute or
relative—of [the 2002 Concession] [...] these are aspects related to the
validity of the administrative decree elements whose content and
transcendence may not and must not be discussed or determined by this
appeal as it constitutes a matter of administrative nature that exceeds the
competence of this Court. [...] The possibility of restoring the concession
or the impossibility of doing so by virtue of being an absolute or relative
nullity, is not part of the object of the writ of amparo, but rather is an issue
that must be determined in the administrative area or in ordinary
jurisdiction. [...] The decision resolving the amparo, in accordance with its
factual records and applicable legal rules, [does not] contemplate the
determination of the absolute or relative nature of the errors or omissions
contained in the concession; that determination is notwithin the jurisdiction
of this court, since the possibility of correcting or rectifying a defect of legal
[significance], or the impossibility of doing so, is an issue that must be
resolved in compliance with the definitions and limits contained in ordinary
legislation. The nature of these procedural defects, when applying the
traditional terminology in relation to relative or absolute errors, is that they
are conceptual categories whose application corresponds to the processes
developed before the ordinary jurisdiction. For this reason, this motion is
to be rejected in every respect.

Third, while in April 2010 the Constitutional Chamber held that the 2008 Concession
did not violate the constitutional right to a healthy environment, ’® it did not declare that
it complied with all legality requirements, as the Claimant contends. Indeed, the
Constitutional Chamber repeatedly stated that it was not competent to rule on the
technical requirements of the EIA, or on whether the Government agencies had
assessed them correctly.” The Chamber's assessment was limited to verifying

complied with the relevant procedures and whether the decisions of the governmenta

tree that would be affected with the change of land use.”)

Itis also true that the Constitutional Chamber made several findings of fact with respect
to the Project's environmental viability.””° While the Tribunal fails to understand the
purpose of the Constitutional Chamber doing so, itremains that the latter left the validity
of the 2008 Concession open, and expressly noted that allegations of non-conformity
should be brought to the relevant authorities, namely, the administrative courts. Be this
as it may, the Administrative Chamber did not confirm the TCA’s findings on
environmental viability; it limited itself to assessing whether the 2008 Concession was
valid in light of the 2002 Moratorium. 7”

In conclusion, the Tribunal does not find that the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision was inconsistent with previous rulings of the Constitutional Chamber.

(ii) Is the Costa Rican Judicial System Structurally Flawed?

The Claimant argues that the Costa Rican judicial system is structurally flawed because
it does not provide any “mechanism to resolve the Administrative Chamber's failure to
respect constitutional cosa juzgada.”’’? Its argument has two prongs. First, the
Claimant argues that, unlike other judicial systems, in Costa Rica there is no body
responsible for resolving inconsistencies between the decisions by the different

Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (16 April 2010), Whereas LXXX, Exh. C-
0225 and R-0096 (So, this technical consideration, as well as the limited impact that climate
change would have on the project area during its execution and closing phase determines that
it should mitigate significantly the concem that was raised at the hearing on this aspect because
according to this, the technical studies determine that the risk for the Mining Project is minimum,
and withit, removing the given risk of drainage acid with [due to] the climate change.”); Whereas
LXXXIV (“So, taking into account the evaluations contained in the Environmental Impact
Assessment, as well as those indicated in other technical documents provided, there is evidence
that the risk of rupture of the dam of the tailings reservoir or overflow of the same reservoir is
minimal, and would have a limited effect on the terrestrial and water environment. In any case,
they would be temporary and reversible. In this sense, [no] constitutional violation is [found] with
respect to the assessment carried out.”); Whereas LXXXVI (“[T]he technical test attached to the
record is highly favorable to the use of the system reported by the appellee to the treatment and
disposal of cyanide, as well as to the management and safety plans that will be implemented to
prevent acid drainage of rocks as that feared [by the appellants due to] accidents or as the
product of seismic events. [The coincidence] to and complementarily of the concerned reports,
[allows] the Chamber [...] to conclude that handling the cyanide in the foreseen manner will
certainly substantially lower the contamination risk by cyanide, both on the aquifer and in
general, because technically it has been shown that cyanide will be destroyed and properly
removed from the sterile material.”); Whereas CV ("To conclude [...] the Chamber establishes
that the survival of the yellow almendro tree is ensured, as the authorized felling has no negative
determin[ing] impact for the population of this species, nor is it barred due to its absent relation
to nesting and breeding sites for the great green macaw.”); CVI (Furthermore, it has been
demonstrated that this almendro tree felling is not categorized as certain threat to the existence
and survival of the great green macaw, since it has been proved that the bird does not nest in
those trees which were authorized to fell, but rather it only arrives to the Crucitas area during
non-breeding seasons and when the almendro tree does not bear fruit, by which in this season
its food supply comes from the fruit of more than thirty varieties of trees in the area.”)

Chambers of the Supreme Court.’73 Second, it contends that the only available remedy
to address conflicting decisions — an action for unconstitutionality — was ineffective.’
The Claimant explains that it challenged the TCA’s interpretation of the constitutiond
principle of res judicata before the Constitutional Chamber but that such Chamber
dismissed the challenge on admissibility grounds. ’”5 As a result, Industrias Infinito had
no remedies left to seek the resolution of the inconsistencies between the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision and the Constitutional Chamber’s prior Decisions.

For the Claimant, the lack of such a remedy amounts to a denial of justice. The Tribuna
does not share this view for the following reasons.

First, the premise of the Claimant's argument has failed. As discussed above, the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision is not in conflict with any decision by the
Constitutional Chamber. In particular, the Constitutional Chamber only ruled on the
Crucitas Project’s constitutionality; it did not rule on the 2008 Concession’s legality or
on the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium to that Concession. Hence, there is no
conflict of decisions that requires resolutions.

Second, leaving aside that first reason, the record shows that such jurisdictiond
conflicts are unlikely to arise. As Dr. Leon, who was the President of the Administrative
Chamber in 2010 and 2011, explains, the Constitutional Chamber has no jurisdiction
over the legality of administrative acts under the Constitution and the Law on
Constitutional Jurisdiction.’’° This is consistent with the TCA’s and the Administrative
Chamber's reasoning in their respective 2010 and 2011 Decisions. It is also in
conformity to the Constitutional Chamber's repeated assertions that it was not
competent to determine matters of legality, as discussed in the preceding section.

The Tribunal is aware that Dr. Calzada, who was the President of the Constitutiond
Chamber between 2008 and 2012, has testified that the Constitutional Chamber has
the power to define its own jurisdiction and may thus decide to address matters of
legality that are relevant to determining whether there has been a violation of a
constitutional right.’”” Dr. Calzada referred to this as a “gray [sic] area” (zona limitrofe)
that may give rise to a jurisdictional conflict. ’”8 While this may be so, the Tribunal cannot
fail to notice that Dr. Calzada presided the Constitutional Chamber when it issued the
April 2010 Decision, where the Chamber repeatedly stated that it was not competent
to rule on technical matters, which it characterized as “asunto[s] de legalidad ordinana’”
(matters of ordinary legality).””9 The Tribunal thus concludes that a jurisdictional conflict

could only arise, if at all, in the event that the Constitutional Chamber, when exercising
its power to define its own jurisdiction, were to determine that it must rule on a matter
of legality in order to decide on the breach of aconstitutional right.

Third, in the rare event that such a jurisdictional conflict might arise, the Tribunal is not
convinced that the Costa Rican judicial system would not provide a mechanism to
resolve it. As Dr. Leon explains, a party may file an action against jurisprudence (accién
contra la jurisprudencia) if it considers that a court decision is unconstitutiona.”®°
Indeed, Dr. Calzada cites a decision of the Constitutional Chamber in which it declared
that a ruling by the TCA had violated constitutional cosa juzgada.7®'

However, pursuant to Articles 75 and 77 of the Law on Constitutional Jurisdiction, this
action must relate to an ongoing proceeding to be admissible; 8? the Constitutiond
Chamber cannot enjoin a proceeding that has already been completed by another
Chamber of the Supreme Court.’ According to Dr. Leon, “[t]he Constitutiona
Chamber can only undertake the action of unconstitutionality against a jurisprudentia
line (or a law), when it is a reasonable means to protect the right or interest that is
considered as injured. For the ruling of the Constitutional Chamber to be useful and
applicable to the [underlying proceeding], it is necessary that [the latter] has not been
resolved.” 764

Here, Industrias Infinito filed its action of unconstitutionality on 11 November 2011,
while the proceedings before the Administrative Chamber were still pending. However,
the Administrative Chamber ruled on the challenge against the 2010 TCA Decision on
30 November 2011. As the underlying proceeding had therefore been resolved, the
Constitutional Chamber could no longer rule on the matter and thus considered it
inadmissible. ”°° The Court reasoned as follows:

It must be emphasized that in this case, [the discussion in the jurisdictional
context has been exhausted]. That is to say, a firm [judgment] wes
[rendered] [and therefore] it was [legally] impossible [for] an action of
unconstitutionality [to develop], in some context, its incidental role. If this
was [decided] on [the] substance, this would not affect at all the legal
relations regulated by the [decision] of the contentious administrative

[tribunal] and the basic sense of this procedural instrument would be
lost.”

The Claimant’s experts, Messrs. Hernandez and Rojas do not object to Dr. Ledn’s
interpretation of the Law on Constitutional Jurisdiction or to the 2013 Constitutiond
Chamber Decision. Rather, they argue that “[t]he Administrative Chamber, knowing that
Industrias Infinito S.A., would bring the unconstitutionality action against its
jurisprudence alleging cosa juzgada of the judgments of the Constitutional Chamber as
the communication that initiated the proceeding alleged this unconstitutionality,
hastened to resolve the appeal so that the action was left without procedural support
and the Constitutional Chamber was forced to, as was done, reject the action for lack
of a procedural mechanism. With it, it avoided that the Chamber could annul its prior
jurisprudence on the matter and would necessarily be forced to annul the judgment of
the Contentious Administrative Tribunal.”7°”

However, the Claimant has adduced no evidentiary supportforthese statements. There
is nothing on record (other than Messrs. Hernandez and Rojas’s report) indicating that
the Administrative Chamber intentionally hastened to issue its Decision for the sole
purpose of rendering Industrias Infinito’s unconstitutionality action ineffective.

The Tribunal thus concludes that there is a mechanism to resolve conflicts of
competence between the Constitutional Chamber and administrative courts which must
be exercised while the administrative proceedings are ongoing. This necessarily
implies that an injured party cannot challenge the unconstitutionality of a decision of
the Administrative Chamber because, as it is the highest administrative court, the
matter will be closed by the time it has ruled on a matter. The question thus arises
whether this limitation to the conflict resolution mechanism constitutes a denial of
justice. For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal does not consider that it does.

Fourth and finally, the Tribunal finds that the lack of a specific body responsible for
resolving conflicts of jurisdiction between the Supreme Court's chambers cannot by
itself amount to a denial of justice.

Citing Paulsson, the Claimant argues that “this lack of a ‘reasonably available national
mechanism to correct the challenged action’ is a systemic failure of Costa Rica’s legal
system.”788 However, Paulsson’s full statement (“[i]nternational law attaches state
responsibility for judicial action only if it is shown that there was no reasonably available
national mechanism to correct the challenged action” 78°) relates to the requirement of
exhaustion of local remedies, which is a different matter. Paulsson did not affirm, as

the Claimant suggests, that the absence of a court similar to the French Tribunal des
conflits amounts to a denial of justice.

The Claimant also relies on Dan Cake to submit that a denial of justice can occur when
“[t]he absence of any reasonably available further recourse against the Court order is
such that, in the circumstances of this case, the breakdown must be treated as
‘systemic’.””°° The Dan Cake tribunal indeed reached this conclusion after having
identified two fundamental flaws in Hungary’s judicial system. First, the local bankruptcy
court refused without proper justification to convene a composition hearing (through
which the investor could have sought to reach a settlement with its creditors). Second,
Hungary's judicial system provided no means to appeal the bankruptcy court's order.”9"
This decision cannot be applied by analogy in the present case, where the Claimant
had access to an appeal (more specifically, to a recurso de casacion or annulment
action) before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court.

In the Tribunal’s view, only a lack of remedy within the host State’s judicial system that
deprives an investor froma fair opportunity to plead its case or implies that access to
justice is virtually non-existent would amount to a denial of justice. That is not the case
here. As discussed in the preceding section, Industrias Infinito raised the res judicata
objection before the TCA and then again before the Administrative Chamber and both
courts considered it. Even in the absence of a court such as the French Tribunal des
conflicts, the Respondent's judicial system provided the Claimant with several
instances and remedies to address the alleged jurisdictional conflict.

The Tribunal’s conclusion is in line with the decision in Philip Morris, where the tribunal
held that the lack of a mechanism for resolving conflicts betweenthe administrative and
civil courts did not amount to a denial of justice: 92

In the Tribunal’s view, it is unusual that the Uruguayan judicial system
separates out the mechanisms of review in this way, without any system
for resolving conflicts of reasoning. The Tribunal believes, however, that it
would not be appropriate to find a denial of justice because of this
discrepancy. The Claimants were able to have their day (or days) in court,
and there was an available judicial body with jurisdiction to hear their
challenge to the 80/80 Regulation and which gave a properly reasoned
decision. The fact that there is no further recourse from the TCA decision,
which did not follow the reasoning of the SCJ, seems to be a quirk of the
judicial system.

Consequently, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the Respondent committed
no procedural denial of justice.

(iii) Has There Been a Breach of Due Process?

Before moving to the Claimant’s substantive denial of justice argument, the Tribund
notes that, in its arguments on expropriation, the Claimant has suggested that in the
TCA proceedings it did not have the opportunity to fully defend itself with respect to the
arguments relating to the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium.’ Specifically, the
Claimant alleges that the application of the 2002 Moratoriumwas not part of the original
complaint brought by APREFLOFAS and was only incorporated at a later stage. As a
result, Industrias Infinito could notrespond to this issue in writing and was thus “denied
its greatest opportunity to address the application of the moratorium in detail.””°4 The
Claimant argues that “[t]his lack of procedural fairness was not cured before the
Administrative Chamber, given that the Administrative Chamber proceeding was an
appeal rather than a hearing at first instance.””°> While the Claimant has raised this
argument as part of its expropriation claim and has not expressly argued that this
amounts to a denial of justice, as it relates to an alleged procedural unfairness, the
Tribunal will address it here.

For the Tribunal, the Claimant has not established that the TCA or the Administrative
Chamber have breached any rule of due process. ’%° The Claimant has not explained
how the TCA departed from Costa Rican procedural law, nor has it proved that it had
no opportunity to make submissions on this matter. To the contrary, the record suggests
that Industrias Infinito was aware of this argument prior to the hearing as it already
asserted that the 2002 Moratorium was not applicable to it in its Answer to
APREFLOFAS petition before the TCA.”

In any event, any failure by the TCA to comply with due process would have occurred
before the cut-off date and the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction over it. The relevant
question is whether the Administrative Chamber failed to remedy this alleged breach
of due process. In the Tribunal’s view, such a failure is not established. In fact, the
record shows that Industrias Infinito made comprehensive submissions on the
applicability of the 2002 Moratorium in front of the Administrative Chamber, ’°° which
the Chamber addressed in its Decision. 79°

While the Tribunal’s analysis focuses onthe 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, it finds that
any breaches of due process by the TCA that might not have been addressed or cured by the
Administrative Chamber could have relevance to whether the Respondent denied justice to the
Claimant.

On this basis, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not established a procedura
breach by the TCA or the Administrative Chamber that could amount to a denial of
justice in relation to the application of the 2002 Moratorium.

c. Did the Respondent Commit a Substantive Denial of Justice?

The Claimant submits that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision amounts to a
substantive denial of justice because the court applied the 2002 Moratorium to the
Crucitas Project in violation of Costa Rican law.®°° Relying on the expert report of
Messrs. Hernandez and Rojas, the Claimant argues that the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision is contrary to Costa Rican law because: ®°!

a. Costa Rica’s Constitution prohibits the retroactive application of laws to investors
with acquired rights.

b. Oniits face, the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to Industrias Infinito’s rights, which
were acquired before the Moratorium was decreed, as the Constitutional Chamber
confirmed in 2002 and 2010.

c. The 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision annulled the 2002 Concession on a
relative, rather than absolute basis, “without prejudice to the findings of the
Environmental Impact Study,” which meant that Industrias Infinito’s acquired rights
had not been extinguished.

d. The application of the 2002 Moratorium was contrary to binding decisions of the
Constitutional Chamber, and thus violated the principles of cosa juzgada and erga
omnes effects.

Relying on Arif, Azinian and Oostergetel, the Claimant submits that the Administrative
Chamber's cancellation of the 2008 Concession when Industrias Infinito had vested
rights within the meaning of the Mining Code is “an inappropriate and egregious
misapplication of Costa Rican law” that amounts to a denial of justice. 992

The Respondent disputes that there has been a substantive denial of justice. It argues
that the Administrative Chamber “correctly determined that [Industrias Infinito] did not
have vested rights that would be protected under the Grandfathering Provision of the
2002 Moratorium.” ®°? The Administrative Chamber found that the 2004 Constitution
Chamber Decision annulled the 2002 Concession with retroactive effects (annulment

ab initio), and that Industrias Infinito “did not have an automatic right to an exploitation
concession by virtue of the exploration permit that it held at one point.”8°4

The Respondent stresses that the Claimant is not challenging the conduct,
independence or good faith of the Costa Rican courts; it is merely in disagreement with
the administrative courts’ decisions. ®5 According to the Respondent, “[jJust because
the Claimant does not agree that the 2011 Administrative Chamber should have
reached its decision does not make the decision a denial of justice.” ®° The Respondent
concludes that “[t]he Claimant’s claims are so far from meeting the threshold for a
substantive denial of justice that they can be properly described as frivolous.”8°7

For the following reasons, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the Respondent has not
engaged in a substantive denial of justice.

First, as was discussed above, the Constitutional Chamber made no definitive findings
on the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project. In its 2002 Decision,
the Constitutional Chamber merely stated that the 2002 Moratorium was not
unconstitutional because it contained a grandfathering provision; in its 2004 Decision,
it did not discuss the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project, and
in its August 2010 Decision, it declined to determine whether the 2002 Moratorium
applied to the 2008 Concession.®°8 The TCA was thus the first judicial authority to rule
on this matter. There can be thus no breach of the principles of cosa juzgada and erga
omnes effects in this respect.

Second, after carefully reviewing the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision, the Tribunal cannot conclude that these courts applied Costa Rican
law incorrectly. The 2010 TCA Decision, which the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision confirmed and made irreversible, devoted five pages to the Governments
failure to apply the 2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project. ®°9 Relying on Article 13 of
the General Law of Public Administration, °'° the TCA explained that under the principle
of non-derogability of rules (principio de inderogabilidad singular de la norma) “the
public authority cannot issue resolutions for a specific case whose contents ignore or
do not apply what the same public authority had previously decided to the contrary ina

general act.”®'' The TCA further noted that, in accordance with the 2002 Moratorium
Decree’s First Transitory Provision, all procedures related to open-pit gold exploration
and exploitation pending before the DGM and the SETENA would be suspended, and
all rights acquired before the publication of that decree would be respected. The TCA
also noted that the 2002 Moratorium was lifted on 4 June 2008, and was thus in place
from June 2002 to June 2008. *?

The TCA then found that the 2002 Concession had been annulled by the Constitutional
Chamber in 2004. In the TCA’s opinion, this nullity was absolute and applied ab initio.
With the Constitutional Chamber’s declaration of nullity, Industrias Infinito’s right to the
exploitation concession thus disappeared. Hence, when in April 2008, the Government
decided to “convert” Industrias Infinito’s concession, the latter had no vested rights.
Accordingly, the TCA concluded that the approval of the EIA, the approval of the
changes to the Project, and the granting of the 2008 Concession (all of which had
occurred while the 2002 Moratorium was in force) had violated the principle of non-
derogability of rules and were thus null and void. °°

The TCA dismissed Industrias Infinito’s argument that an exploration permit
automatically grants the permit holder the right to an exploitation concession. It held
that, under a systematic interpretation of the Mining Code, the right to explore is
different and independent from the right to exploit. Pursuant to Articles 23(b) and 26 of
the Mining Code, an exploitation concession will only be granted to an exploration
permit holder if the requirements listed in Articles 8 and 9 of the Regulation to the Mining
Code are fulfilled.®'* The TCA therefore found that Industrias Infinito’s submission that
it had acquired exploitation rights as an exploration permit holder was “absolutely
unfounded and, in addition, [it] d[id] not conform to reality.”'5 Accordingly, the TCA
concluded that Industrias Infinito had no acquired right within the meaning of the Mining
Code when it applied to validate its concession on 30 May 2007.

The TCA further considered that the conversion of the 2002 Concession had been
unlawful, inter alia because such mechanism could not apply to acts which had been
declared null and void by a court, as was the case here, because such a declaration
implies that the act has been eliminated from the legal system. It also found that it did

not follow from the Constitutional Chamber's “without prejudice” statement that such

court regarded the nullity as relative, or that the 2002 Concession could be
converted. ®16

Finally, as discussed in the preceding section, the TCA assessed and rejected
Industrias Infinito’s res judicata objection. When discussing the applicability of the 2002
Moratorium, the TCA once again stressed that the Constitutional Chamber had
expressly referred the application of the 2002 Moratorium and the conversion of the
concession to the administrative courts, which were the competent authorities to
resolve these matters. ®17

The Administrative Chamber confirmed the TCA’s reasoning in this respect. It
undertook an in-depth analysis of the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium to the
Crucitas Project, focusing on the principle of non-derogability of rules, and concluded
that (i) an exploration permit does not automatically ensure its holder that it will be
granted an exploitation concession, which is subject to different and separate
requirements; (ii) Industrias Infinito had no vested right to exploit the Crucitas mine
following the annulment of the 2002 Concession, and (iii) the mechanism of conversion
was not applicable in this case, and in any event the conversion would have been
effective ex nunc, i.e., as of the date of the conversion. The Administrative Chamber
also noted that the 2002 Moratorium had been in effect from 12 June 2002 until 4 June
2008. Accordingly, the entire administrative process that led to the granting of the 2008
Concession, as well as the actual grant of that Concession, was in violation of the 2002
Moratorium and of the principle of non-derogability of rules.®8 As this was the crucial
element upon which the validity of the Concession depended, the Administrative
Chamber considered that it did not need to address the remaining challenges against
the TCA’s decision. ®19

When assessing a claim for denial of justice, the Tribunal’s analysis must focus on the
judgment of the court ruling on the last remedy, i.e., the Administrative Chamber
Decision. Having assessed that decision, the Tribunal cannot discern the existence of
a substantive denial of justice. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was
premised on Costa Rican law and reasoned. While the Administrative Chamber's

reasons and conclusions could be characterized as formalistic, there was no
misapplication of domestic law. As discussed above, the Administrative Chamber did
not violate res judicata in respect of the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium or the
validity of the Concession, because the Constitutional Court had not adjudged these
matters.

Moreover, contrary to the Claimant’s contention, the Administrative Chamber did not
apply the 2002 Moratorium retroactively. While the 2002 Moratorium had been repealed
when the 2008 Concession was granted, that repeal had not yet come into effect.

Industrias Infinito’s argument was that it owned a vested right that was protected from
the application of the 2002 Moratorium. The Administrative Chamber addressed this
argument and concluded that Industrias Infinito did not own a vested right on the date
when the 2002 Moratorium came into force, and thus could not be validly granted an
exploitation concession while the 2002 Moratorium was in effect.

In conclusion, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Administrative Chamber incurred
in a substantive denial of justice.

(ii) Did the Respondent Otherwise Breach the FET Standard?

The Tribunal now turns to whether the Respondent has treated the Claimant's
investments unfairly and inequitably through conduct that does not amount to a denial
of justice.

The Claimant submits that the “combined effect’ of four of the challenged measures
(i.e., the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, the
2012 MINAET Resolution and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision), together
with “the Government's choice not to allow the project to proceed, violated the FET
standard by breaching Infinito’s legitimate expectations, failing to treat Infinito’s
investment in a consistent, predictable manner, and treating Infinito arbitrarily because
the foundational measure served no rational purpose.”®° The Claimant also argues
that, through the 2015 TCA Damages Decision and the proceedings reinitiated
thereafter the Respondent has continued to breach FET.®21

To assess whether the challenged measures were unfair and inequitable, the Tribunal
must review the facts that led to those measures. Pursuant to Article XII(3)(c) of the
BIT, claims for breaches and damage in respect of which the Claimant had actual or
constructive knowledge prior to 6 February 2011 are time-barred. However, to
understand the context and reasoning of the challenged measures (of which three are
judicial decisions that by nature rely on prior facts to reach their conclusions), the
Tribunal must assess all of the facts that led to the challenged measures. A majority of

the Tribunal has also determined that claims related to the annulment of the
Concession by the Administrative Chamber on 30 November 2011 are not time-barred.

As discussed in Section V.D.3.b(ii)a supra, the Claimant's FET claim has two main
elements, one related to the loss of the Concession (a) and another premised on the
impossibility to reinitiate the process after the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban (b). A third
element relates to the 2015 TCA Damages decision and the proceedings that have
been reinitiated thereafter (c), as discussed in Section V.D.3.b(vi) supra. The Tribund
will address these elements in turn.

a. Did the Respondent Treat the Claimant Unfairly and Inequitably
in Relation to the Loss of the Concession?

Infinito’s FET claim in relation to the loss of the Concession has three prongs. It
contends that the Respondent breached its legitimate expectations, failed to treat it
consistently and predictably, and acted in an arbitrary manner.

In terms of legitimate expectations, the Claimant argues that “[w]hen the Government's
conduct is considered as a whole, it is clear that Infinito had an objectively reasonable
legitimate expectation that it would be able to proceed with the Crucitas project in
accordance with the Mining Code, which contained no moratorium at the time of
investment.”®22 The Claimant has grounded this expectation on two elements: (i) the
legal framework (and in particular the Mining Code) in force when it made its initial
investment and (ii) the Government’s conduct, which supported this expectation by
making efforts to advance the Project.

With respect to the legal framework, the Claimant submits that it invested in reliance
on the clear provisions of the Mining Code, pursuant to which an exploration permit
holder would have the right to obtain an exploitation concession, provided it had
discovered an exploitable deposit. The Claimant contends that this mechanism was
established specifically to attract foreign investors such as itself,®23 and constituted the
quid pro quo upon which the granting of the exploitation concession was based.®4
Based on this “clear legal framework”, the Claimant asserts that:

a. “[W]hen Industrias Infinito obtained an exploration permit in January 1996, it
legitimately expected to be able to conduct exploration work to search for minerds
in the Crucitas project area and to receive an exploitation concession for the
Crucitas project area once it proved the existence of deposits within the Crucitas
project area.” 825

b. It also “legitimately expected that its rights could not be taken away except in
accordance with the legal framework set out in the Mining Code then in effect,”

arguing that “[i]t would not have invested in the project if its right to an exploitation
concession and the exploitation concession itself could be arbitrarily revoked at
any time by the application of a moratorium on open-pit mining.”®26 The Claimant
notes in this respect that the Costa Rican Constitution provides that “[n]o law shall
have retroactive effect in prejudice to any person, or to his acquired patrimonial
rights or to any consolidated legal situations.”®?”

For the following reasons, the Tribunal does not consider that the Respondents
conduct should be assessed under the prism of legitimate expectations.

First, as a matter of fact, Industrias Infinito was granted an exploitation concession in
accordance with the Mining Code, not once, but twice. The problem was not the
Government's refusal to grant this concession; it was that, in both instances, the Costa
Rican courts found that concession to be flawed, and therefore annulled it. The
Claimant's first expectation is therefore moot.

Second, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Claimant’s second expectation qualifies
as “legitimate”, as this term is understood in international investment law. Investment
tribunals have consistently held that, to be protected under the FET standard, the
expectation must have arisen froma specific assurance, commitment or representation
given by the State on which the investor relied to make its investment. ®6

Here, the Claimant has not been able to identify any specific assurances that it would
be allowed to proceed with the Crucitas Project. In particular, it received no specific
assurances that “[a]bsent any of the specific grounds set out in the Mining Code, and
absent compliance with the associated annulment or cancellation process, an
exploitation concession could not be annulled or cancelled.”®29 Indeed, none of the
facts alleged by the Claimant amount to specific assurances from the Government that
Industrias Infinito would be able to operate the Crucitas Project, that the 2002
Moratorium did not apply to it, or that the concession could not be cancelled or annulled
other than on the grounds set outin the Mining Code. In addition, many of the facts that
the Claimant invokes as assurances occurred after its initial investment. Specifically:

The Claimant alleges that Minister of the Environment Rodriguez represented to
Infinito in 2002 that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to the Crucitas Project.6°°
However, there is no evidence of this representation other than the witness
testimony of Mr. Hernandez, who asserts that, during a meeting in the first quarter
of 2003 after the 2002 Moratorium had entered into force, the Minister (i)
“confirmed the Government's position against mining, but stated that acquired
rights would be respected;” (ii) “declared that SETENA would continue with [the
EIA] process and that his office would not intervene in the process;” and (iii)
“expressed that SETENA’s decision would be respected.”®31 There is no
documentary evidence of these statements, but in any event the Minister merely
declared that acquired rights would be respected and that the Government would
notinterfere with the permitting process. He did not representthat Industrias Infinito
had an acquired right to exploit the Crucitas Project.

The Claimant further alleges that in August 2002 the Constitutional Chamber
confirmed that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to the Crucitas Project. ®? As
discussed in paragraph 461.a supra, the Constitutional Court only held that the
2002 Moratorium was constitutional because it respected acquired rights; it did not
say that Industrias Infinito held an acquired right.

The Claimant relies on certain statements that President Pacheco made in May
2004, allegedly accepting that the Project could continue. Specifically, a news
article reports the President as having stated that “there is no way of stopping
something in progress, and if | had not kept the word of previous governments,
then Costa Rica would have been subject of a multimillion dollar claim [...]."8°9 Mr.
Rauguth commented in this respect that he “was personally satisfied to learn that
President Pacheco himself grudgingly acknowledged the legality of the project, and
[he] viewed this as further indication that development of the Crucitas site would
not be further delayed by questionable government and political intervention.”®°4
However, this does not amount to an assurance that any permits or concessions
granted would be immune from judicial scrutiny.

The Claimant also submits that the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision (which
annulled the 2002 Concession “without prejudice” to the EIA) constitutes an
assurance that the project could proceed through the EIA approval process, even
though the 2002 Moratorium was in effect.®35 However, as noted in paragraph 462
supra, in 2004 the Constitutional Chamber did annul the 2002 Concession, and the

meaning of its “without prejudice” statement is unclear. Moreover, in 2007 the
Constitutional Chamber declared itself incompetent to clarify whether an EIA would
cure the nullity, 6 and in August 2010 it declared itself incompetent to determine
whether the 2002 Moratorium applied to the Project. 8°”

e. Infinito stresses that the Minister of the Environment defended the legality and
constitutionality of the 2002 Concession before the Constitutional Chamber during
the proceedings that led to the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision.®8 While
this shows that the Government supported the Project or, at the very least,
defended the legality of its actions, it is not equivalent to an assurance that the
Project could proceed if the 2002 Concession was found to be flawed.

f. The Claimant further notes that, following the 2004 Constitutional Chamber
Decision, “Infinito and the Government proceeded on the mutual understanding
that [Industrias Infinito] had the right to rectify the defect found by the Constitutional
Chamber and have its exploitation concession restored.”®°° The Claimant points to
(i) SETENA’s review of Industrias Infinito’s EIA spanning 22 months and including
significant discussions with Industrias Infinito’s representatives, visits to the Project
site, and the largest public hearing in Costa Rica’s history;®4° (ii) SETENA’s
ultimate approval of the ElA for the Projectin 2005, and the declaration by SETENA
that the Project was environmentally viable; *1 (iii) SETENA’s review and approval
of the EIA modification and its declaration that the modified Project was
environmentally viable in February 2008; 84? (iv) President Arias’s decision to repeal
the 2002 Moratoriumin March of 2008, as part of a decree safeguarding the mining
environment in Costa Rica; ® (v) President Arias and Minister Dobles’s decision

process of conversion; ®*4 and (vi) the grant by SINAC of aland use change permit
in October 2008, which was the last permit required before the construction of the
mine could be completed. *®45 While the Tribunal agrees that these facts show the
Government's understanding that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to the Project,
they do not amount to an assurance that the Moratorium did not apply as a matter
of law, nor did they guarantee that authorizations or concessions would be shielded
from judicial scrutiny.

g. The Claimant also relies on Minister Dobles’ appearance before the Costa Rican
Legislative Assembly in October 2008. ®4¢ It is true that Minister Dobles stated that
“[t]he processes [for the approval of the EIA and the granting of the exploitation
concession], whose final acts [SETENA Resolution 170-08 and MINAE Resolution
217-08] are firm today, have [been carried out in] to a strict adherence to legal and
constitutional regulations,” and that “[a]bsolutely all of the processes have been
respected, and furthermore, the company has complied with all legal and
regulatory requirements.”847 However, these statements, which were not
addressed to Infinito, cannot be construed as a guarantee that the Concession and
related approvals would not be subject to judicial scrutiny, or that they would not
be annulled if the courts found that some statutory or regulatory requirements had
not been complied with.

h. Finally, the Claimant argues that the 2010 Constitutional Chamber Decision
“concluded that the project was environmentally sound, in compliance with Article
50 of the Political Constitution and that the exploitation concession and other
project approvals were constitutional and lawful.”®48 As discussed in paragraphs
464-467 supra, the Constitutional Court only held that the Project did not violate
the constitutional right to a healthy environment, but expressly declined its
competence to opine on whether it met the (legal) technical requirements. °49

While the overall conduct of the Government (including statements, authorizations and
the granting of the 2008 Concession) indeed demonstrates that the Government
supported the Crucitas Project and considered that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply
to it, they do not amount to specific assurances granted to the Claimant in order to

induce it to invest, nor do they amount to a guarantee that the 2002 Moratorium did not
apply to the Project as a matter of law.

The Claimant appears to recognize the lack of specific assurances, as it grounds its
alleged expectation on the legal framework as it existed at the time of the investment,
and in particular on the Mining Code and the Costa Rican Constitution’s prohibition of
retroactivity. However, the legal framework does not assist the Claimant. Contrary to
the Claimant’s contentions, Articles 61 and 63 of the Mining Code do not provide an
exhaustive list of the grounds on which a concession may be annulled or cancelled;
they merely list examples of such grounds.®° Indeed, Article 61 makes it clear that
concessions shall be null and void if they are granted in violation of “the law,” not “this
law.” Itis thus clear that, to be valid, exploitation concessions must meet all applicable
legal requirements, not only those set out in the Mining Code. The Claimant could not
have legitimately expected that its exploitation concessions would be immune from
judicial scrutiny if they were granted in violation of applicable legal norms.

The Claimant also argues that the 2002 Moratorium changed or “eviscerated” the lega
framework. Yet, absent specific assurances, the FET standard does not protect
expectations in relation to the stability of a State’s legal framework.®' Unless they
expressly undertake not to do so, States are free to modify the legal regime applicable
at the time of the investment to the extent they do so within the limits prescribed by
FET, i.e., the evolution must not be unreasonable, discriminatory, disproportionate, or
adopted contrary to due process. 852

Moreover, a prohibition of retroactivity, such as the one in Article 34 of the Costa Rican
Constitution, usually does not prohibit the passing of legislation with effects for the
future, at least when acquired rights are protected. Here, when Costa Rica modified its
legal framework through the 2002 Moratorium, it did in fact respect acquired rights. It is
undisputed that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to exploitation concessions that had
already been granted. It is for this reason that the Claimant believed that the 2002
Concession, which was granted prior to the enactment of the 2002 Moratorium, was
not affected by it. However, as discussed in paragraphs 83, 497 and 501 supra, the

Mining Code, Law No. 6797 (4 October 1982), Article 61, Exh. C-0015 (“Permits and
concessions granted in contravention of the law shall be null, and especially in the following
circumstances: [...]”); Article 62 (“Exploration permits may be cancelled if the holder fails to
comply with the obligations specified in this Law and its regulations, particularly in the following
cases: [...].”).

See e.g., Parkerings, J 332, Exh. CL-0068; TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC v. Republic of
Guatemala, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23, Award, 19 December 2013 (“TECO’”), | 629, Exh. CL-
0165; Micula, 1 666, Exh. CL-0060. It is true that some decisions upheld legitimate expectations
regarding legal frameworks deemed to (i) have contained specific guarantees; and/or (ii) have
been adopted precisely to attract foreign investors and encourage their investments, which is
not established to be the case of the Costa Rican Mining Code. See e.g. LG&E Energy Comp,

Constitutional Court found that the 2002 Concession was null and void because it had
been granted without a prior EIA, and the TCA and the Administrative Chamber found
that this nullity was absolute and operated ab initio. Accordingly, the basis for Industrias
Infinito’s acquired rights disappeared. When a new concession was granted in 2008,
the TCA and the Administrative Chamber held that the 2008 Concession was also null
and void because it was granted while the 2002 Moratorium was in force.

In light of the preceding considerations, itis clear to the Tribunal that the loss of the
Claimant’s Concession was not caused by a modification of the legal framework. This
is not acase of breach of legitimate expectations of legal stability. What is at stake here
is something different: it is whether, when guiding the Claimant in its investment
process and issuing the relevant permits, the Respondent acted reasonably,
consistently, and in compliance with its own law, and whether its courts applied
domestic law in conformity with Costa Rica’s international obligation to accord FET to
the Claimant’s investment.

In this respect, the Tribunal starts by recalling that the Claimant invested in Costa Rica
in 2000, when it acquired Industrias Infinito. In 1997, the then President of Costa Rica
had declared mining to be an industry of national convenience.®3

Industrias Infinito held an exploration permit which had been granted in 1993, and had
been extended to September 1999. Between 1993 and 2000, Industrias Infinito
confirmed the existence of gold deposits. It applied for an exploitation concession on
18 December 1999, which it obtained in December 2001 and which became effective
in January 2002 (“2002 Concession’).**4 The 2002 Concession had a ten-year term,
subject to extensions and one renewal, and allowed Industrias Infinito to extract,
process and sell the minerals from the Las Crucitas gold deposit. The 2002
Concession specified that “[t]he concession holder, prior to commencing the
exploitation activities, shall obtain the approval of the Environmental Impact
Assessment, duly approved by the [SETENA]. Six months shall be granted for its
submission to the [DGM].”8°

However, in 2004, the Constitutional Chamber declared the 2002 Concession invalid,
because the EIA should have been approved before the concession was granted.®5”
The Chamber thus annulled the 2002 Concession, “without prejudice to what the
environmental impact assessment may determine.” 8

To assess the implications of this Decision, it is necessary to address the legal
framework that governed exploitation concessions at the time. Article 23 of the Mining
Code provides that an exploration permit holder “shall have the right” (or “shall be
entitled”, according to the Claimant’s translation), inter alia, to “[rleceive one or more
exploitation concessions if [it] demonstrate[s] that one or more commercially viable
mineral substances deposits exist and are located within the perimeter zone specified
in their exploration permit [.]”85° However, contrary to the Claimant's contentions, the
Mining Code does not guarantee that an exploitation concession will be automatically
granted under any circumstances. Article 26 makes it clear that, in order to obtain an
exploitation concession, the exploration permit holder must have complied with the
obligations and met the requirements set out in both the Mining Code and related
Regulations.®© Indeed, the Claimants’ own experts, Messrs. Hernandez and Rojas,
confirm that the right to obtain an exploitation concession is not automatic. °°

It is undisputed that, on 17 December 2001, (the date on which Industrias Infinito was
granted the 2002 Concession), the Mining Code did not require the approval of an EIA
as a prerequisite for an exploitation concession. Article 34 of the Mining Code provided
that “[a]n exploitation concession holder shall be obliged: [...] To carry out a complete
environmental impact study of the exploitation process in compliance with the
requirements set forth in Article 97 and with the rules that regulate environmenta
pollution and the recovery of renewable natural resources.”®° In other words, the
Mining Code required those who had already obtained an exploitation concession to
carry outan EIA. The 2002 Concession thus appeared to comply with the requirements
set out in the Mining Code.

This being so, it is undisputed that a new regulation to the Mining Code was issued in
February or March 2001 (the “2001 Regulation’) which required that the EIA be
approved prior to the granting of the concession. ®* The Claimant argues that, pursuant
to the transitory provisions of the 2001 Regulation, the new sequencing of the EIA did

not apply to applications for exploitation concessions already submitted when the 2001
Regulation came into effect (as was the case with Industrias Infinito’s application), and
that those applications continued to be processed in accordance with the rules in place
before the 2001 Regulation came into force.*4 Transitory Provision | of the 2001
Regulation reads as follows:

All applications pending on the date of publication of this regulation, will
continue their process with the regulations in force at the time of their
application. However, once granted the right to a permit or concession, the
work of supervision and control will be carried out pursuant to this
regulation.®*

The Constitutional Chamber did not refer to this transitory provision, but stated that
“once the exploitation concession is granted, the Administration retains the authority to
revoke the exploitation concession for a breach of the obligations of the company listed
in the preceding subparagraphs of [that] precept), 100 and 101 (sanctions and
prohibitions), all from the Mining Code.”®°6 By “that precept”, the Tribunal understands
the Constitutional Chamber to mean Article 9 of the 2001 Regulation, to which it had
referred earlier in the paragraph. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that, on its
own, this appears to amount to a retroactive application of the 2001 Regulation.
However, the Constitutional Chamber also noted that the requirement that the EIA
should be approved prior to the granting of the concession stemmed from the
preventive principle in environmental matters, which had been “absorbed in
constitutional jurisprudence” under Article 50 of the Constitution since 1995, 8°” but the
excerpt quoted by the Constitutional Chamber did not refer specifically to the
requirement of an EIA.

The Respondent has argued that “the requirement to present an EIA prior to the
granting of an exploitation concession had been firmly established in Costa Rica's legal
order since 1993.”®°8 The Respondent cites a decision of the Constitutional Chamber
of May 2001, issued afterthe 2001 Regulation had become effective, © which referred
to a decision from 1993 that found that a provision of the draft Hydrocarbons Law was
unconstitutional because it allowed the EIA to be approved after aconcession had been
granted.®”° However, this is the only jurisprudential instance on record requiring an EIA

to be approved prior to the granting of a concession before the issuance of the 2001
Regulation.®”

The Respondent also notes that, according to Article 17 of the Organic Law on the
Environment, enacted in 1995, “[t]he prior approval [of an EIA] by [the SETENA] shall
be an indispensable requirement to initiate activities, works or projects” “that alter
or destroy elements of the environment or generate residues, toxic or dangerous
materials.”®’2 The TCA also invoked this provision in 2010 to argue that Article 34 ch)
of the Mining Code had been tacitly abrogated.*’3 However, the Organic Law on the
Environment does not require the approval of an EIA prior to the granting of the
concession; it requires approval of an EIA prior to the commencement of activities.
Article 34 ch) of the Mining Code is thus not inconsistent with the Organic Law on the
Environment. Importantly, the 2002 Concession complied with both provisions, as it
specified that “[t]he concession holder, prior to commencing the exploitation
activities, shall obtain the approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment, duly
approved by the [SETENA]. Six months shall be granted for its submission to the
[DGM].”8”4

As a result, the Tribunal finds that the requirement of an EIA prior to the granting of a
concession was not “firmly established” in the Costa Rican legal framework when the
2002 Concession was granted, and that the 2002 Concession met the requirements of
the Mining Code, the transitory provisions of the 2001 Regulation and the Organic Law
on the Environment.

The Claimant has not claimed that the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision was a
denial of justice, nor could it, as the claim would be time-barred. The Tribunal is thus
not concerned with the reasoning in this Decision. What matters for present purposes
is that the Constitutional Chamber annulled the 2002 Concession because it was
flawed. There is no evidence on record that this flaw was induced by any misconduct
on the part of the Claimant. Accordingly, it can only be attributed to the State,
specifically to the MINAE, which issued the Concession.

This is consistent with the Costa Rican administrative law principle of impulso de oficio,
pursuant to which the Administration has the duty to “encourage or promote the
procedure ex officio, even without requiring agesture froma party, in order to make the
procedure as expeditious and effective as possible, that is, to process without undue

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant’s legal expert, Ms. Araya, has referred to two other
instances in which the Constitutional Chamber stated that the an EIA should be a prerequisite
to the granting of a mining permit or concession (Constitutional Chamber, Decision No. 1221-
2002, 6 February 2002, Exh. C-0805, and Constitutional Chamber, Decision No. 1220-2002, 6
February 2002, Exh. C-0807), but they both post-date the issuance of the 2001 Regulation.

delay for its interveners.”875 The Claimant’s expert, Dr. Araya explains this principle as
follows (an explanation with which Dr. Leon concurs®’*):

[P]ublic agencies have the obligation to ‘push’ the process forward to its
final phase. That is why, in response to requests fromindividuals, agencies
must review them, verify their requirements and, if they do not comply, it
is their duty to request clarification or modification of submitted matters or
request the presentation of information that is missing. Once the
presentation of all the requirements has been verified, if approved, the
process must move on to the next stage, and so on, until the final decision
is reached. °”

Dr. Araya concludes that (i) “it is illogical to attribute to a private entity (and not to the
State) the responsibility for directing an administrative process, determining the
applicable legal instruments, interpreting the regulations, detecting formal or technica
omissions, taking into account specific prohibitions of the matter or making clarifications
in cases of lack of certainty”, °78 and (ii) “it is the State (and not the private entity) that is
responsible for the advancement and direction of the administrative procedures, and it
makes its own decisions, which must always be motivated and in accordance with the
principle of legality.”°”° Dr. Leon agrees with both statements, but clarifies that “this
principle does not assure compliance with the legality principle, nor does it exclude the
jurisdictional control over the conduct (either active or passive).”®®° Be that as it may, it
remains that it is the Government's duty to determine the necessary requirements for
an administrative procedure, and to inform the petitioner of the action which it needs to
take for that procedure to be successful.

As a consequence, it is clear that the legal defect of the 2002 Concession can only be
attributed to the State. It was the State’s duty to direct the process whereby Industrias
Infinito would obtain its exploitation concession, and to determine the sequencing of
the various approvals. Given the clear terms of Article 34 of the Mining Code, Transitory
Article | of the 2001 Regulation and Article 17 of the Organic Law on the Environment,
the lack of a firmly established jurisprudence to the contrary, and the impulso de oficio
principle, one cannot reasonably blame the Claimant for not having realized that the
black letter law laid down in the Mining Code, the 2001 Regulation (transitory
provisions) and the Organic Law on the Environment had been tacitly abrogated.

Because the 2002 Concession was declared null and void, the TCA and the
Administrative Chamber finally held in 2011 that the 2002 Concession had been
removed from the legal system, with the consequence that Industrias Infinito had no
acquired rights that would protect it from the operation of the 2002 Moratorium.

Notwithstanding, the Government continued to work with Industrias Infinito to move the
Project forward. Industrias Infinito continued with the EIA process, which included a
public hearing with the participation of over 1,000 persons and visits by the SETENA
Plenary Commission.®*' In August 2005, SETENA approved the EIA, and requested
Industrias Infinito to present a sworn affidavit of environmental commitments, make a
financial deposit to serve as an environmental guarantee, appoint an environmenta
regent, and submit to SETENA a book of records.®8? In December 2005, once Industrias
Infinito had submitted the environmental affidavit, SETENA confirmed the
environmental viability of the Project.8&3 In response to changing market conditions,
Industrias Infinito updated its feasibility study (carried outin compliance with Canadian
securities law), and requested an amendment of its EIA, which SETENA approved on
4 February 2008.%4 On 15 February 2008, Industrias Infinito presented a revised
feasibility study to the DGM, which considered extracting more gold from the same
amount of material, as a result of the rise in the price of gold.®®

The record shows that these processes were lengthy and involved several
presentations from Industrias Infinito, many meetings with Government officials, and
extensive review by SETENA. The Claimant's witnesses assert, and the Respondent
has not denied, that during these processes no Government official suggested that
these administrative processes or the approvals granted were prohibited by the 2002
Moratorium. ®

Relying on the Constitutional Chamber’s statement that the 2002 Concession had been
annulled “without prejudice to what the environmental impact assessment may
determine,”®®” on 30 May 2007 (after its EIA had been approved), Industrias Infinito
applied to cure its concession through the mechanism of validation (convalidaci6n),®°°

which would have cured the concession retroactively. 88° However, on 11 April 2008,
the DGM recommended to MINAE’s legal counsel to use the mechanism of conversion
to restore the exploitation concession.*®°° Article 189 of the General Law of Public
Administration makes it clear that conversion may be applied to acts that are invalid as
a result of absolute or relative nullity, that it converts the invalid act into a different valid
one provided the former meets all formal and material requirements of the latter, and
that it takes effect as of the date of the conversion. ®"

It bears noting at this juncture that, concerned about the status of its concession, in
2006 Industrias Infinito requested the Constitutional Chamber to clarify the nature of
the annulment it had declared and whether it had been cured through the approval of
the EIA.892 But the Constitutional Chamber refused to give this clarification, declaring
itself incompetent.®® Yet, the Constitutional Chamber expressly told Industrias Infinito
that if it considered that it had remedied the violations previously identified, it should
take its query to the relevant “administrative and jurisdictional processes.”®%4 The
Constitutional Chamber also stressed that it had annulled the 2002 Concession not
because it had detected defects in the administrative decree itself, but because the
Chamber had determined that the decree violated the precautionary principle and
constitutional right for the enjoyment of ahealthy and balanced environment set out in
the Constitution. ®9 Similarly, when faced with a request from a different petitioner, the
Constitutional Chamber declared, in August 2010, that it lacked jurisdiction to decide
whether the 2002 Moratorium applied to the Crucitas Project. 89°

The Respondent has also contended that, by filing its 2006 request for clarification to
the Constitutional Chamber, Industrias Infinito showed that it had doubts as to the type
of nullity declared by the Constitutional Chamber and that, when that court declared
itself incompetent to give this clarification, it should have applied to the TCA. Had

Industrias Infinito done so, it would have known that it had no vested rights, that the
Project was subject to the 2002 Moratorium and therefore could not proceed. ®”

The Tribunal sees the matter differently. Whether or not the 2002 Moratorium applied
to the Crucitas Project was not clear. First, Industrias Infinito had been granted a
Concession before the Moratorium entered into force; in principle its right to exploit the
concession was grandfathered. Second, while the 2002 Concession was indisputably
annulled by the Constitutional Chamber, given the Constitutional Chamber’s “without
prejudice” statement, it was unclear whether that nullity was absolute or relative. Had
the nullity been relative, the Concession could potentially have been be validated
(convalidada) or remedied (saneada) with retroactive effect,®°° which would have
meant that Industrias Infinito’s Concession would have been grandfathered, and the
2002 Moratoriumwould not have applied to it. Third, the Government continued to work
with Industrias Infinito towards the approval of the EIA and restoration of the
Concession. It is undisputed that no branch of the Governmentattempted to apply the
2002 Moratorium to Industrias Infinito prior to the 2010 TCA Decision. Fourth, Industrias
Infinito tried, unsuccessfully, to obtain clarification from the Constitutional Chamber as
to the status of its Concession, which shows diligence and good faith. Fifth, the
Constitutional Chamber’s cryptic 2004 Decision (annulling the Concession “without
prejudice to what the [EIA] may determine”), coupled with its 2006 and 2010 Decisions
refusing to opine on the nature of the nullity declared or the applicability of the 2002
Moratorium, add to the lack of transparency of the legal framework. In view of all of
these elements, the Tribunal does not concur with the Respondent that the Claimant
should have known that the 2002 Moratorium applied to it. Even if it suspected that it
might, neither the administrative agencies nor the courts had confirmed such
application at that stage.

Indeed, as anticipated above when discussing the assurances alleged by the Claimant,
the actions of the Government between 2004 and 2008 show that it considered that the
2002 Moratoriumdid not apply to the Project. These actions are discussed in paragraph
516 supra to which the Tribunal refers. It is particularly clear from Minister Dobles’s
statements quoted at paragraph 516 (g) supra that the Govemment firmly believed that
the Project complied with all statutory and regulatory requirements and was not subject
to the 2002 Moratorium.

The Government thus moved forward with all the necessary authorizations and granted
the 2008 Concession. It is not clear why the Government decided to “convert” the
Concession (which created a new concession rather than restoring the previous

one), ®99 but there is no doubt that the Government's intention was for the Project to go
ahead.

This intention is confirmed by the fact that President Arias repealed the 2002
Moratorium by decree on 18 March 2008,°° i.e., before the 2008 Concession was
granted about a month later on 21 April 2008. However, under its Article 6, this decree
would come into effect on the date of its publication, which occurred only on 4 June
2008. The reasons for this delay in publication are unclear. Be this as it may, the fact
is that the Government issued the 2008 Concession when the 2002 Moratorium was
still in effect. Once again, the exploitation rights granted to Industrias Infinito were
vitiated by a legal flaw that can only be attributed to the Costa Rican Government.

The facts just discussed resemble a comedy of errors, with tragic consequences forthe
Claimant: the two exploitation concessions granted to Industrias Infinito were legally
deficient and, as a result, Industrias Infinito was caught by the 2002 Moratorium. As
unfortunate as this situation may be, the Tribunal cannot disregard the fact that all of
the events described above happened prior to the cut-off date (6 February 2011). Any
claims arising from the Government's conduct between 2001 and 2008 are thus time-
barred.

The Tribunal turns to assessing whether the Costa Rican courts treated the Claimant
unfairly and inequitably. Two decisions are relevant here: the 2010 TCA Decision,
which declared the annulment of the 2008 Concession, and the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision, which confirmed the TCA Decision. While the 2010 TCA Decision
was issued prior to the cut-off date, it became irreversible on 30 November 2011, when
it was confirmed by the Administrative Chamber. Accordingly, the majority of the
Tribunal has found that any claims arising from the annulment of the 2008 Concession
are not time-barred.°"

As discussed in paragraphs 496-500 supra, in 2010 the TCA declared that the 2008
Concession was null and void on various grounds, including that it had been granted
while the 2002 Moratorium was in force. The other grounds for annulment stated by the
TCA were (i) the fact that Industrias Infinito interpreted the exploration permit as
automatically granting an exploitation concession; (ii) the application of the doctrine of
conversion to an act that had been annulled ab initio by a Costa Rican court six years
earlier; (iii) the fact that Industrias Infinito had requested a modification of the
declaration of environmental viability instead of filing anew EIA; and (iv) that Industrias
Infinito omitted to inform the administration that it was planning to create a pond on a
public road and that it attempted to circumvent the technical restrictions as to

The DGM Memorandum recommending the conversion is silent as to the reasons for the choice

excavation.°°2 However, it was the fact that the 2008 Concession was granted while
the 2002 Moratorium was in force, that the Administrative Chamber characterized in its
2011 Decision as the crux of the matter, upon which the validity of the Concession
rested. On this basis, the Administrative Chamber addressed only the violation of the
2002 Moratorium and deemed it unnecessary to refer to the other deficiencies identified
by the TCA.9%

As discussed in paragraph 501 supra, the Administrative Chamber found that, as a
result of the annulment of the 2002 Concession by the Constitutional Chamber in 2004,
Industrias Infinito had no vested right to exploit the Crucitas mine following the
annulment of the 2002 Concession. Hence, the 2002 Moratorium precluded the
Government from continuing the permitting process with Industrias Infinito, and the
2008 Concession (which was granted while the 2002 Moratorium was still in force) was
null and void.

The Tribunal cannot find fault with these conclusions. As noted when discussing the
Claimant’s denial of justice claim, this decision was premised on Costa Rican law and
reasoned. It cannot be characterized as arbitrary or capricious. As explained in EDF
and Lemire, a measure is arbitrary when (i) it “inflicts damage on the investor without
serving any apparent legitimate purpose; (ii) it “is not based on legal standards but on
discretion, prejudice or personal preference;” (iii) it is “taken for reasons that are
different from those put forward by the decision maker;” or (iv) it is “taken in wilful
disregard of due process and proper procedure.” As summed up in Lemire, “the
underlying notion of arbitrariness is that prejudice, preference or bias is substituted for
the rule of law.” That was clearly not the case here.

The Claimant nonetheless argues that the application of the 2002 Moratorium to the
Crucitas Project in 2010-2011 served no rational purpose because by then the 2002
Moratorium had been repealed. However, when dealing with court decisions that is not
the proper test. The question is whether the court decided on the basis of the law that
was applicable to the facts before it. When the 2008 Concession was granted, it is
undisputed that the 2002 Moratorium was in force. The fact that it was later repealed
should have no effect on the court’s reasoning.

Nor can the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision be faulted for being inconsistent
with the Government's prior conduct. While a government's conduct might qualify as
inconsistent for purposes of FET if the same agency (or two agencies in the same
sphere of competence) issue contradictory decisions that cause harm to an investor,

this is not the case “when the second agency, applying substantive legal criteria
established in a pre-existing legal framework, takes a decision which diverges fromthat
previously adopted by another agency.” 9° As the Respondent has rightly pointed out,
this is not inconsistent conduct; it is the operation of the rule of law. Here, the Tribunal
has found that the Administrative Chamber Decision complied with Costa Rican law.

For these reasons, the majority of the Tribunal finds that the Administrative Chamber's
decision to annul the 2008 Concession cannot be deemed a breach of Costa Rica’s
obligation to accord FET to the Claimant’s investments.”

b. Did the Respondent Prevent the Claimant from Applying for a
New Concession in Breach of the FET Standard?

The Claimant also contends that, through the combination of the 2011 Legislative
Mining Ban and the 2012 MINAET Resolution, the Respondent prevented it from
reinitiating the concession process in breach of FET.

The Claimant's case in this respectis essentially that the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision only annulled the 2008 Concession and some related administrative acts, but
not the administrative process (the “tramite’) itself. In the Claimant's submission, under
the Mining Code before the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban was passed, upon the
revocation of the 2008 Concession, Industrias Infinito would have reverted to the status
it would have had before the grant of the Concession, i.e., that of an exploration permit
holder who had applied for an exploitation concession. In this capacity, it would have
been able to reinitiate the process and request a new concession. However, this was
made impossible by the combined effect of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, which
prohibited the grant of new exploitation concessions in perpetuity and ordered the
cancellation of all pending proceedings, and the 2012 MINAET Resolution, which
cancelled not only the Concession, but also all of Industrias Infinito’s pre-existing
mining rights (presumably to implement the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, as the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision did not order the cancellation of Industrias Infinito’s
pre-existing mining rights).

As a result, the Claimant argues that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban “breached
Infinito’s expectation that it could proceedwith the Projectin accordance with the Mining
Code, and arbitrarily changed ‘the rules of the game’ and the legal framework
applicable to Infinito.”°° It also contends that the application of this Ban to the Crucitas
Project served no rational purpose, as the Constitutional Chamber had confirmed that

Arbitrator Stern does not disagree with the substantive statement, but considers that sucha
statement is barred for two cumulative procedural reasons, one being that a court decision
cannot be reviewed under the standard of FET, the other being that the act which has annulled
the Concession was the 2010 TCA Decision, not the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.

the Project was environmentally viable.°1° Not only was there “no proportionality
between the means employed and the aim sought to be realized,” but Infinito bears an
excessive burden — indeed, the only burden, as Industrias Infinito was the only
company affected by the Ban.°""

As to the 2012 MINAET Resolution, the Claimant argues, first, that the Government
could have chosen to take a different course of action following the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision, and second, that the Government exceeded its powers as the
Resolution went beyond what the Administrative Chamber had ordered. Not only did
the 2012 MINAET Resolution cancel the 2008 Concession; it also archived the file and
declared the Crucitas area free of any mining right, thus preventing Industrias Infinito
from continuing with the administrative process it had already started with its
exploration permit. The Claimant speculates that this cancellation might have been
premised on the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, which ordered all pending proceedings
to be cancelled and archived.°'? The Claimant’s FET claim against the 2012 MINAET
Resolution is thus tied to its claim against the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, which the
2012 MINAET Resolution allegedly implemented (and indeed, the Claimant repeatedly
characterizes the “interaction” between these two measures as the source of the
alleged breach of FET).°8

The 2011 Legislative Mining Ban was a statute that amended several provisions of the
Mining Code. In particular, it amended Article 8 of the Mining Code as follows: 9'4

Mining exploitation in areas declared national parks, biological reserves,
forest reserves and state refuges of wildlife is prohibited.

[-]

All the areas of The Abangares Canton, Osa and Golfito, with potential for
metal mining, are declared mining reserve zones and are frozen in favour
of the State, based on the technical studies carried out by the Directorate
of Geology and Mines of the Ministry of Environment, Energy and
Telecommunications (Minaet).

This reserve includes all the areas which are free of exploitation
concessions and all of those which, in the future, may acquire such
condition, whether it is by the expiration, cancellation or any other form of
expiration of the previously granted rights.

In the mining reserve area established in this article, only exploration
permits, mining exploitation concessions and [benefit of] material[s] may
be granted to properly organized workers in cooperatives dedicated to
mining in a small scale for the subsistence of families, artisanal mining and
prospector use (coligallero), according to the terms established in this Law
and its Regulations.

560.

The granting of these permits and concessions shall be given, exclusively,
to cooperatives of workers for the development of mining in a small scale
for the subsistence of families, artisanal mining and prospector use
(coligallero) from communities surrounding the exploitation sites, based on
the amount of affiliates of such cooperatives. The affiliated workers cannot
belong, at the time, to more than one small scale mining cooperative.

Small scale mining for the subsistence of families is understood as the
underground extraction carried out through manual and mechanic
collective work, where the extraction volume is established by the
Directorate of Geology and Mines according to the technical-geological
studies submitted in the concession request, taking into consideration the
use of modern exploitation techniques to maximize the metal extraction
and the environmental protection in line with sustainable development. For
determining the volume to be under concession, the Directorate of Geology
and Mines shall apply equity and proportionality criteria according to the
number of affiliated workers and the concession requests.

For this purpose, the Executive Branch shall recover through the relevant
authority, in accordance with the due process, the concessions which are
in no use or exploited in an irregular manner. No concession shall be
renovated or extended if it fails to comply with the provisions of this article.
The Directorate of Geology and Mines is authorized to grant exploration
permits and mining concessions for mining in small scale for the
subsistence of families, artisanal mining and coligallero.

The 2011 Legislative Mining Ban also amended Article 8 bis of the Mining Code in the
following terms: 915

Permits or concessions shall not be granted for the exploration and
exploitation activities of open-pit mining of metallic minerals on national
territory. It is established as an exception that only exploration permits for
scientific and investigatory purposes shall be granted.

The Ban contained a grandfathering provision, according to which “concession rights
acquired in good faith and in compliance with all requirements of the current legislation,
prior to its entry into force are excluded from the provisions of this Law.”°16 However, it
also stated that “[alll [proceedings] related to exploration permits and [exploitation]
concessions to engage in open-pit metal mining activities, which are pending in the
Directorate of Geology and Mines and the National Technical Environmenta
Secretariat at the date of entry into force of the present Law, shall be archived.” 9'7

The Tribunalis not convinced that, in the abstract, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban was
unfair and inequitable. More specifically, it is not convinced that the Ban lacked a
rational purpose and is therefore arbitrary. While it is not clear from the Ban itself that
its purpose was to protect the environment (there is no preamble or message explaining
its reasons), certain provisions in the Ban suggest that the protection of the environment

may have been at least part of the purpose behind is enactment.°"8 The Tribunal also
notes that small-scale miners (organized workers in cooperatives dedicated to mining
in a small scale for the subsistence of families, artisanal mining and prospector use
(coligallero)) were excluded from the Ban.°'9 They were also allowed to use cyanide
and mercury leaching techniques for eight years following the entry into force of the
Ban, which does not quite conform to the objective of protecting the environment.
However, the Tribunal accepts that Costa Rica may have had other reasons (e.g.,
social or economic reasons) to exclude small-scale mining from the Ban.

By contrast, the Tribunal is of the view that the application of the 2011 Legislative
Mining Ban to the Claimant was unfair and inequitable. While as discussed above the
Claimant could have no legitimate expectation of legal stability, the Tribunal finds that
the application of the Ban to the Crucitas Project was disproportionate to the public
policy pursued.

As noted in AES, for a measure to be reasonable, “there needs to be an appropriate
correlation between the state’s public policy objective and the measure adopted to
achieve it,” and “[t]his has to do with the nature of the measure and the way it is
implemented.” 9° In the Tribunal’s view, the measure must also be proportionate to its
purpose. The Claimant has alleged (and the Respondent has not contested) that, at
the time of its enactment, the only project caught by its provisions was the Crucitas
Project. However, at that point in time, the Constitutional Chamber had already ruled
that the Project was environmentally sound. There was thus no reasonable correlation
between the aim sought by the measure and its effect on the Claimant.

To be reasonable and proportionate vis-a-vis the Claimant (while still capturing future
projects that were untested), Parliament could have included a grandfathering provision
that protected the Crucitas Project, or could have allowed pending proceedings to
continue.

The Respondent has argued that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban had no impact on
the Claimant, because as a result of the 2010 Executive Moratoria, Industrias Infinito
was in any event precluded from applying for anew concession. For the Tribunal, this
argument relates to causation (and is addressed further below). In terms of its content
and scope, the Tribunal finds that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban definitively forbade
open pit-mining for an indefinite period, thus depriving the Claimant of any real
opportunity to reinitiate the Crucitas Project. By contrast, the 2010 Executive Moratoria
did not prohibit open-pit mining outright; they merely established a suspension of such

For instance, Article 4 amended Article 103 of the Mining Code to add that “[t]he use of cyanide

accordance with the provisions of The World Health Organization” “shall be considered factors

activities. Nor did they order all pending proceedings to be archived. The Tribunal is
not persuaded by Dr. Leén’s explanation that archiving a file is a physical process and
does not mean that the rights do not exist. 92" It is clear from the Ban that the intention
was to terminate all pending proceedings.

The effect of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban on the Claimant was that, once the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision confirmed the annulment of the Concession, it was
no longer allowed to request anew mining concession. Had the 2011 Legislative Mining
Ban not ordered the cancellation of pending proceedings, and had the 2012 MINAET
Resolution not acted upon it, following the annulment of the 2008 Concession,
Industrias Infinito would have returned to the position it was in before the grant of the
concession, i.e., an exploration permit holder with a pending application for an
exploitation concession. To reach this conclusion, the Tribunal has taken the following
elements into account:

First, the Claimant relies on the expert evidence of Messrs. Hernandez and Rojas, 92
and of Dr. Araya. 923 While Dr. Araya’s reliability was called into question at the hearing,
her evidence is grounded on the clear terms of Article 171 of the General Law of Public
Administration, which provides that “[t]he declaration of absolute nullity shall have a
purely declaratory and retroactive effect to the date of the act, all without prejudice to
the rights acquired in good faith.” 974

Second, the Respondent has not specifically addressed the Claimant's argument that
the annulment of a concession does not cancel the underlying proceedings and
previously acquired administrative rights. The Respondent has argued that an
exploration permit does not automatically grant the right to an exploitation
concession, but that is not the point here. It has also submitted that, because
Industrias Infinito’s exploration permit expired in September 1999, it could not have
applied for anew exploitation concession even absent the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban
and the 2012 MINAET Resolution.

It is true that Article 26 of the Mining Code provides that “[dJuring the term of an
exploration permit and up to sixty days after the expiration of the term or its extension,
the [exploration permit] holder shall be entitled to obtain an exploitation concession,
provided that [it] ha[s] fulfilled [its] obligations and the requirements of this Law and its
regulations.” 92° However, this provision must be interpreted as requiring an exploration

permit holder to apply for an exploitation concession within that period. To interpret it
as requiring an exploitation concession to be granted within those 60 days would not
conform with reality, as the permitting process may take several years, as the case at
hand proves. Indeed, Dr. Leén confirms that this interpretation is correct. 92”

It appears undisputed that Industrias Infinito applied for an exploitation concession in a
timely manner, i.e., within 60 days following the expiry of the exploration permit.%° If,
prior to the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, Industrias Infinito could have retained its rights
in tramite (as acquired administrative rights), it seems irrelevant if the exploration permit
had already expired.

Third, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent's argument that, pursuant to
Article 63 of the Mining Code, the cancellation of all mining rights is the natural
consequence of the concession’s annulment. While it is true that Article 63 provides
that, once a concession is cancelled, the DGM “shall issue the corresponding
cancellation resolution,” and once this resolution is firm, “the zone shall be liberated
from the respective mining rights,”°29 Article 63 refers to cases of cancellation due to
caducidad, i.e., cases in which the concession holder has failed to comply with the
conditions set out in the concession or in the law.%° It does not refer to cases of
annulment caused by legal flaws attributable to the granting authority when the
concession holder is in good faith.

In the Tribunal’s view, in light of Article 171 of the General Law of Public Administration,
the right of an exploration permit holder to apply for an exploitation concession must
survive the annulment of aconcession granted unlawfully when the concession holder
is in good faith. Importantly, Dr. Ledn appears to acknowledge that the process initiated
by Industrias Infinito in 1999 to obtain an exploitation concession was still pending (“en
tramite”) as a result of the annulment of the concession(s):95"

In Industrias Infinito’s case, the Mining Registry was cancelled by judicial
order, as a consequence of the absolute nullity of Concession 578-2001
and, by default, nullity of Concession 217 - 2008. That very nullity caused
the company to have a case in process and a procedure that was
suspended due to the indicated moratorium.

These considerations suggest that, but for the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and the
2012 MINAET Resolution, after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, Industrias
Infinito would have been restored to the position of an exploration permit holder with a
pending application for an exploitation concession. While the 2010 Executive Moratoria
would not have allowed Industrias Infinito to request a new exploitation concession
then, this Moratorium was not an outright prohibition, and Industrias Infinito could have
retained its rights in tramite until those Moratoria were repealed.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the application of the 2011 Legislative Mining
Ban to the Claimant was unfair and inequitable.

The Claimant also argues that the 2012 MINAET Resolution amounted to a breach of
FET. It is true that the 2012 MINAET Resolution declared the Crucitas Project free of
all mining rights, 2 when neither the TCAnor the Administrative Chamber expressly so
provided. However, this declaration logically flowed from the annulment of the 2008
Concession and more particularly from the order in the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban
that all pending proceedings be archived. The Tribunal sees the 2012 MINAET
Resolution as an ancillary action taken in the implementation of the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. As such, it cannot be
assessed as an independent breach of FET, but shares the fate of these actions.
Accordingly, to the extent that it applied the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision,
the 2012 MINAET Decision does not amountto a breach of FET. However, to the extent
that it applied the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, it forms part of that FET breach.

As to the Claimant’s argument that the Government's inaction following the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision was a policy choice, the Tribunal is of the view that
the Government could not have acted differently once the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban
was in place. The Government cannot issue permits that violate domestic law. The
breach of FET occurred with the Ban itself; not with the Government's subsequent
conduct.

c. Does the Respondent Continue to Treat the Claimant in an
Unfair Manner?

The Claimant also contends that, by reinitiating the TCA Damages proceeding, the
Respondent continues to treat Infinito unfairly and inequitably.

The 2010 TCA Decision ordered Industrias Infinito, the Government and SINAC to bear
the costs of restoring the Crucitas site to its pre-project condition. Through the 2015
TCA Damages Decision, the TCA ordered Industrias Infinito, the SINAC and the State
to pay USD 6.4 million for environmental damages within six months. In December
2017, the Administrative Chamber overturned the 2015 TCA Damages Decision for
lack of motivation and remanded the file to the TCA. More specifically, the
Administrative Chamber held that the TCA did not assess the experts’ report on

Resolution No. 0037, MINAET, File No. 2594 (9 January 2012), Exh. C-0268. In addition to
cancelling the 2008 Concession, this resolution ordered the “Administrative file 2594 [to be]
archived,” and “the area [to be] liberated from the Mining Registry.”

environmental damages, did not make any reference to the parties’ positions and did
not justify the rate which it applied to determine the amount of the damages. This
proceeding sat inactive until January 2019, when the TCA reinitiated it. 935

The Claimant contends that “[t]he continuation of this proceeding continues Costa
Rica’s breach of the fair and equitable standard, and any damages and costs (including
defence costs) associated with this proceeding are further damages to Infinito resulting
from that breach.” 954

In contrast to the four other measures challenged by Infinito, this measure does not
relate to the loss of the Concession or Industrias Infinito’s inability to pursue a new one;
it relates to damages that Industrias Infinito might be required to pay as a result of its
use of the site, which damages Infinito deems arbitrary. As discussed in Section
V.D.3.b(vi) supra, the Tribunal considers that this claim pertains to a distinct FET
violation.

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that this claim is premature. The TCA has
not issued any decision quantifying the damages to be paid by Industrias Infinito.
However, it cannot be said that the claim is manifestly without legal merit, as the
Respondent also contends. It is undisputed that the 2010 TCA Decision ordered
Industrias Infinito to bear part of the costs of restoring the site, and this decision was
confirmed by the Administrative Chamber. What remains to be decided is the amount
that Industrias Infinito will need to pay. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the claim is
premature and thus inadmissible at this stage, but will not declare that it lacks merit.

Conclusion on FET and Impact on Quantum

In conclusion, a majority of the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has breached
its FET obligation through the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and, as an ancillary act, the
2012 MINAET Resolution (to the extent that it implemented that Ban). The effect of
these measures was to deprive Industrias Infinito of the opportunity to apply for anew
exploitation concession.

Although it considers the breach established, the Tribunal has difficulty identifying the
damage which the breach may have caused. Had it not been for the 2011 Legislative
Mining Ban and the 2012 MINAET Resolution, after the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision Industrias Infinito would have been restored to the position of an exploration
permit holder with a pending application for an exploitation concession. However, at
that time, the 2010 Executive Moratoria, which were still in place, would have barred
Industrias Infinito from obtaining anew exploitation concession.

586.

The Claimant argues that, despite this, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban had a “clear
impact” on the Crucitas Project.%5 The argument is essentially that (i) it was the 2011
Legislative Mining Ban and not the Administrative Chamber Decision which mandated
the cancellation of its remaining mining rights, and (ii) the 2010 Executive Moratoria
“would not have deprived [Industrias Infinito] of its underlying rights, which [Industrias
Infinito] could have built on to seek restoration of its key permits, once lifted.”9°

While these considerations may well be correct, they do not suggest that the 2011
Legislative Mining Ban caused a quantifiable harm. The fact remains that, regardless
of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, Industrias Infinito was precluded from applying for
an exploitation concession because of the 2010 Executive Moratoria. While these
Moratoria did not establish a permanent mining ban, there is no indication in the record
as to when Industrias Infinito would have been able to reapply for an exploitation
concession. It should also be noted in this context that the 2010 Executive Moratoria
were issued prior to the cut-off date and that therefore any claim related to them is time-
barred.

Even if the Tribunal were to accept that the fact of harm was established, this would
not assist the Claimant's case. There is no basis in the record, and Infinito has
articulated none, allowing the Tribunal to quantify the damage caused by this
standalone breach. Pursuant to the full reparation standard stated in the Chorzéw
Factory case, “[rJeparation must, as far as possible, wipe-out all the consequences of
the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed
if that act had not been committed.”%°’ Here, absent the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban
and the 2012 MINAET Resolution, Industrias Infinito would have been in the situation
of an exploration permit holder. Assuming arguendo that the 2010 Executive Moratoria
did not already prevent Industrias Infinito from restarting the process, the Claimant's
harm would essentially consist in the loss of an opportunity or chance to apply for an
exploitation concession. Yet, the Claimant has not put forward a quantification for such
a loss of opportunity, nor has it provided the Tribunal with any elements to calculate it.
If one adds the inherent uncertainty and the regulatory risk involved in any application
process, the monetary consequences of this loss of chance appear too speculative to
give rise to an award of damages.

The Tribunal thus concludes that it cannot award damages for the FET breach
stemming fromthe 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, alone or in conjunction with the 2012
MINAET Resolution.

FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY

The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that, contrary to Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, Costa Rica failed to
grant Infinito’s investments FPS.

a. The FPS Standard Under Article II(2)(b)

The Claimant makes four submissions with respect to the scope of the FPS standard
enshrined at Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.

First, it argues that the FPS standard covers the physical as well as the legal security
of its investments. 9° The wording of the BIT does not limit the obligation to physical
security and, in the absence of such language, the standard should be interpreted to
include legal security. °°° Relying on Biwater Gauff, the Claimant submits that “when the
terms ‘protection’ and ‘security’ are qualified by ‘full’, the content of the standard may
extend to matters other than physical security.”%° This is supported by the definition of
“Investment” in the BIT, which is broad and includes both tangible and intangible
assets."

Second, the Claimant asserts that the FPS standard is independent from the FET
standard.*2 These standards are contained in two different provisions, which means
that the “drafters intended for these standards to independently provide protection.”%43
The Claimant further contends that “it would significantly undermine the protections of
the BIT to declare a decisive rule that the [FPS] standard imposes nothing separate or
independent from Article II(2)(a).”%44

Third, the Claimant acknowledges that the FPS standard does not impose strict or
absolute liability on the Respondent, but requires it to act with due diligence to protect
its investments by adopting all possible measures that could be reasonably expected.
It thus requires active conduct on the part of the State, not the mere abstention from
prejudicial conduct. 945

Fourth, the Claimant contends that the FPS standard protects investors from injuries,
irrespective of whether they were caused by the host State actors or a third party.°4°
The Claimant further contends that “[dJenying the application of the full protection and
security clause against the state’s own actions would deprive the application of the
clause to legal security of any meaning.” %7

b. The Respondent Breached Its Obligation to Provide Full Protection and
Security

The Claimant contends that the Respondent failed to provide legal security to Infinito’s
investments and that its behavior falls below the standard of due diligence. Specifically,
Costa Rica failed to create a legal system protecting Industrias Infinito’s mining rights
and providing a process to uphold those rights. 94°

For the Claimant, the following actions by the Respondent show that it did not grant
legal security for the Claimant’s investments: (i) the Administrative Chamber annulled
the 2008 Concession on the basis of the 2002 Moratorium even though it did not apply
to the Crucitas Project; (ii) the Minister of the Environment then formally cancelled the
2008 Concession and extinguished Industrias Infinito’s pre-existing mining rights; (iii)
the Respondent did not put in place a legal system to prevent the issuance of
inconsistent decisions by its courts.%49

Contrary to the Respondent's contentions, making the judicial system available to the
investor and ensuring that decisions are taken in good faith is insufficient; the FPS
standard includes ensuring the stability of the legal system as a whole. By “maintaining
a legal system that allows for contradictory decisions to co-exist without a mechanism
to address this inconsistency,” the Respondent failed to do so, and it did not make its
judicial system available to the Claimant in a meaningful way.%5°

Infinito further argues that the FPS obligation binds not only Costa Rica's judicial organs
and executive branch, which “had a duty not only to refrain from acting negligently, as
it did, but to take actions to correct unacceptable behavior.”°5' Here, the Government
committed errors in granting Industrias Infinito’s permits and approvals and failed to
adopt a mechanism to address the conflicting decisions issued by the Supreme Court,

or to rectify the situation created by the annulment of the Concession and the 2011

The Respondent’s Position

a. The FPS Standard

The Respondent argues that (i) the FPS standard under Article II(2)(b) of the BIT is
limited to physical security; (ii) the definition of “investment” does not expand the scope
of the FPS standard; (iii) the FPS standard does not provide protection in addition to
the FET obligation; and (iv) the correct legal standard of the FPS obligation only
requires due diligence and good faith. 95°

First, the Respondent submits that the FPS standard does not compel a host State to
ensure the legal security of investors’ assets. Relying on Saluka and Rumeli, the
Respondent argues that the FPS clause is not meant to cover any kind of impairment
of an investor's investment, but only to protect the physical integrity of an investment
against interference by use of force.94 The fact that this is not expressly stated in the
BIT does not mean that the FPS standard extends to legal security.°> Citing
Parkerings, the Respondent denies that the reference to “full” protection and security
makes a difference in the level of protection a State is required to provide.95°

According to the Respondent, the Claimant's interpretation of Article II(2)(b) of the BIT
is at odds with the Contracting Parties’ intention. As Canada has emphasized in its
Non-Disputing Party Submission, the scope of the FPS standard of the BIT is limited to
physical protection and security of qualifying investments.%” This interpretation is
consistent with the rules on treaty interpretation provided in the VCLT, as it conforms
to the ordinary meaning of “full protection and security” in its context and in light of the
Treaty’s object and purpose. It is also supported by Canada’s treaty practice, as in
recent treaties “Canada has taken steps to clarify that the [FPS] obligation ‘has always
been intended to refer to physical protection and security’ — for example through a joint
interpretive statement.”95°

Second, the Respondent denies that the definition of “investment” widens the scope of
the FPS standard because it includes both tangible and intangible assets.%° Many
arbitral awards involving treaties with similarly broad definitions of “investment” have

held that the FPS standard is limited to physical protection.°®° As noted by the AWG
Group tribunal, the cases cited by the Claimant (such as CME®%*' and Azurix®®) have
not provided any reason to depart from the historical interpretation of the standard.

Third, even assuming, quod non, that the FPS obligation protects legal security, the
Respondent contends that it could not impose an obligation that would go beyond the
FET standard. The Claimant's position that the FPS and FET standards impose
distinct and independent protections is unfounded. %5 Several arbitral decisions have
held that an extensive interpretation of the FPS standard would resultin an undesirable
overlap with the FET standard.%°° The Respondent further agrees with Canada’s view
that the FPS standard reflects the MST under customary international law.%°” Insofar
as the FPS standard has independent significance, its application is limited to the
protection against acts of third parties. °°

Fourth, the Respondent submits that the FPS standard does not impose strict liability
on the host State; it only requires due diligence from the host State, namely a
“reasonable degree of vigilance” and an obligation “to act in good faith.” 99 In other
words, the FPS standard is not a guarantee or an obligation of result.9’° Relying on

AAPL and Lauder, the Respondent argues that the “due diligence requirementis limited
to what is reasonable in the circumstances.”9”' The Respondent further stresses that
the threshold to establish a breach to the FPS obligation is high. 972

b. The Respondent Did Not Breach Its FPS Obligation

The Respondent submits that it did not breach Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, as neither the
challenged judicial measures nor the actions of the executive branch have failed to
provide FPS to the Claimant's investments.

(i) The Judicial Measures Challenged by the Claimant Did Not
Amount to a Breach of Costa Rica’s Full FPS Obligation

The Respondent denies that the judicial measures of which the Claimant complains
(the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the alleged lack of a mechanism to
address inconsistencies between the decisions of the Supreme Court) amount to a
breach of FPS.

First, the Respondent argues that Costa Rica could not have breached the FPS
standard since there is no allegation of physical harm.97°

Second, assuming that the FPS standard extends to legal security and protection, quod
non, Infinito has established no denial of justice.9”4

Third, under the same assumption, the Respondent complied with the due diligence
imposed by the FPS standard, which only requires “Costa Rica’s judicial system [to be]
available to the Claimant and [...] the decisions of the Costa Rican judiciary [to be]
taken in good faith and tenable.”975 The issuance by a domestic court of a judgment
adverse to the investor does not establish a breach of the FPS obligation.97° According
to the Respondent, the Costa Rican courts rendered their decisions “in good faith,
impartially and with due respect for Industrias Infinito’s procedural rights” and in
accordance with Costa Rican law. More specifically, the Administrative Chamber
provided Industrias Infinito with a full opportunity to presentits case, including through
written and oral pleadings.°7’ In the alternative, the Respondent contends that a mere

error in the application of domestic law does not amount to a breach of the FPS
standard.978

Further, the Respondent contends that the Costa Rican courts assessed and rejected
all of the Claimant’s arguments relating to the res judicata principle and the co-
existence of contradictory decisions within Costa Rica’s judicial order.°”9 As discussed
in the context of denial of justice, there is no inconsistency between the decisions of
the Administrative and the Constitutional Chambers, because each Chamber has its
own area of competence. °°

Finally, the Respondent argues that “it would not have been reasonable to expect Costa
Rica to overhaul its entire legal system and introduce a new judicial mechanism simply
to address these allegedly conflicting decisions.”°*' Its actions were reasonable: it
ensured a fair process for all parties and provided for a judicial system in which each
Chamber has its own area of jurisdiction, precisely in order to avoid contradictory
decisions. 92

(ii) The Actions of Costa Rica’s Executive Branch Did Not Amount to
a Breach of the FPS

At the outset, the Respondent repeats that the FPS standard could not have been
breached since the Claimant does not point out to any physical harm.%3 In any event,
the Respondent disputes that Costa Rica’s executive branch acted in a manner that
could give rise to a breach of the FPS standard.

First, the FPS standard only requires the host State to comply with a duty of due
diligence. 984

Second, the Claimant's argument that Costa Rica’s executive branch “failed to rectify
the situation” is too vague to establish a breach to the BIT. If the Claimant’s argument
is that the MINAET should have disregarded the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision, it is misguided, as “[s]uch action would not only be
‘contrary to the legal system’, but also likely result in criminal and disciplinary
proceedings against MINAE[T] officials for failure to abide by an express legal
mandate.”9°5

Third, as to the Claimant's position that the executive branch failed to adopt a
mechanism to address the inconsistencies in its legal system, the Respondent
contends that the executive branch cannot “reform the judiciary at will and thereby alter
the checks and balances under the Costa Rican Constitution.”9°°

Fourth, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal cannot take into account the
executive errors in granting Industrias Infinito’s permits and approvals since these facts
fall outside its jurisdiction ratione temporis.°8"

Fifth, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant that the 2012 MINAET Resolution
extinguished its pre-existing mining rights without a valid basis. This is because the
Claimant did not have such rights when the 2008 Concession was annulled, as
Industrias Infinito’s exploration permit had expired on 18 September 1999. 988

Sixth, the Respondent submits that the most the Claimant could reasonably have
expected was for the executive branch to assist Industrias Infinito in defending the
legality of the Concession before the Costa Rican courts, which it did.9°°

Finally, the Respondent stresses that any complaint with regard to the 2011 Legislative
Mining Ban relates to the actions of Costa Rica’s legislative branch. In any event, as
discussed in the context of FET, the 201 1 Legislative Mining Ban had notimpact on the
Claimant. 9°

Canada’s Position

In its Non-Disputing Party Submission, Canada argues that Article 1I(2)(b) of the BIT
does not extend beyond the physical protection and security of investments. Canada
submits that this interpretation is in accordance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT, as the
ordinary meaning of the words “protection” and “security” point to “a general meaning
of safety from physical harm, injury or impairment.” 991

Canada further asserts that the FPS standard was historically developed in the context
of physical protection and security of acompany’s officials, employees or facilities, and
submits that the notions of “protection and constant security” or “full protection and
security” in international law have traditionally been associated with situations where

the physical security of the investor or its investment was compromised.%2 Hence,
when it is interpreted in light of its object and purpose, it is clear that the FPS standard
is intended to provide physical protection and security for investments.

Canada also states that this interpretation is supported both by arbitral jurisprudence®s
and its treaty practice.9°4 For instance, recent treaties concluded by Canada provide
that the FPS obligation refers to physical security or police protection.°°5 Canada has
also taken steps to clarify that the FPS obligation in older treaties (which do not
expressly refer to physical safety) has always been limited to physical protection and
security. 96

The Tribunal’s view is that, absent treaty language indicating that legal security is
covered, the FPS standard is intended to ensure physical protection and integrity of the
investor and its property within the territory of the host State. While the stability of the
business environment and legal security are captured by the standard of fair and
equitable treatment, the full protection and security standard primarily seeks to protect
investment from physical harm done by third parties.9°° As noted by the Enron tribuna,
“there might be cases where a broader interpretation could be justified, but then it
becomes difficult to distinguish such situation from one resulting in the breach of fair
and equitable treatment, and even from some form of expropriation.”°99 This Tribuna
concurs that an overly extensive interpretation of FPS standard may result in an overlap
with the other standards of investment protection, which is neither necessary nor
desirable.

While some awards, such as CME, adopted a broader interpretation of FPS covering
also legal security and protection, a number of subsequent awards have maintained
the more traditional approach to interpreting the notion of FPS. In Sa/uka, the tribuna
noted that “[t]he practice of arbitral tribunals seems to indicate [...] that the ‘full security
and protection’ clause is not meant to cover just any kind of impairment of an investor's
investment but to protect more specifically the physical integrity of an investment
against interference by use of force.” 1° Similarly, the tribunal in Parkerings held that
“[i]t is generally accepted that the variation of language between the formulation
‘protection’ and ‘full protection and security’ does not make a difference in the level of
protection a State is to provide.”'°°' A similar rationale has been applied by arbitral
tribunals in BG, PSEG and Rumeli.1°2

The Parties further disagree as to whether the FPS standard forms part of FET
standard, as submitted by the Respondent, or is a separate standard of protection, as
argued by the Claimant. In the Tribunal’s opinion, the fact that the Costa Rica-Canada
BIT addresses FET and FPS in two distinct subparagraphs of Article |I(2) indicates that
the Contracting Parties intended them to cover two different obligations. Thus, a
contextual interpretation requires the Tribunal to give effect to that intention by giving
the two concepts distinct meanings and fields of application, a position that is supported
by the practice of investment tribunals. 1° For instance, as stated in Jan de Nul, “[t]he
notion of continuous protection and security is to be distinguished here from the fair

and equitable treatment standard since they are placed in two different provisions of
the BIT, even if the two guarantees overlap.” 1°

As to the content of the FPS standard, the Tribunal is of the view that the FPS standard
does not provide absolute protection against physical harm. '°° In the words of the ICJ
in ELSI, “[t]he reference [...] to the provision of ‘constant protection and security’ cannot
be construed as the giving of a warranty that property shall never in any circumstances
be occupied or disturbed.” 196

Nor is the standard one of strict liability; rather, it imposes an obligation of due
diligence. °°” After a thorough analysis on the subject, AAPL concluded that the FPS
standard imposes “an ‘objective’ standard of vigilance in assessing the required degree
of protection and security with regard to what should be legitimately expected to be
secured for foreign investors by a reasonably well organized modern State.” 10°° More
specifically, the tribunal clarified that this standard requires the State to take “the
reasonable measures of prevention which a well-administered govemment could be
expected to exercise under similar circumstances.” Other tribunals have
endorsed this position, '°'° with the result that the FPS standard is thus an obligation of
means, not of result. That said, a mere lack of due diligence will suffice to breach
international law; there is no need to establish malice or negligence. 1°"

With these specifications in mind, the Tribunal will now determine whether the
Respondent breached Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.

b. Has the Respondent Breached the FPS Standard?

The Claimant’s FPS claim is premised on an alleged failure by Costa Rica to provide
legal security to the Claimant's investments; the Claimant has not pointed to any
physical harm. As the Tribunal has found that the BIT’s FPS standard only protects
against physical harm, the Claimant’s claim must fail.

EXPROPRIATION

The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that Article VIII of the BIT covers both direct and indirect
expropriation and that judicial measures can be expropriatory (a). The Claimant also
alleges that it held rights capable of expropriation (b) and that the challenged measures
amount to both a direct and indirect expropriation of its investments.

a. The Standard for Expropriation

(i) Definition of Expropriation Under Article Vill of the BIT

The Claimant submits that the concept of expropriation provided in Article VIII of the
BIT covers any measure having an effect “equivalent to” nationalization or expropriation
and therefore encompasses direct and indirect expropriation. '0'2

Relying on Quiborax and Burlington, the Claimant argues that a direct expropriation
occurs “where a measure permanently deprives an investor of its property by forcibly
taking or transferring the property to the State.”'°'3 The Claimant further asserts that
“[a]n indirect expropriation occurs where a measure, or a combination of measures,
substantially interfere with the investor’s ability to use or derive the economic benefits
from an investment established in the territory of the host State, even if it is not
necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.” 1014

Based on Vivendi II and Burlington, the Claimant further submits that “[e]vidence of an
expropriatory intent may only serve to confirm the expropriation under the effects test,
butis not a requirement in and of itself.”1015

Finally, the Claimant argues that an expropriation is lawful and complies with Article
VIIL of the BIT when the following requirements are met: (i) it is for a public purpose; (ii)
it was conducted in accordance with due process of law; (iii) it was conducted on a non-
discriminatory basis; and (iv) prompt, adequate and effective compensation was
paid. 116

(ii) Judicial Measures Can Be Expropriatory

The Claimant argues that judicial measures can be expropriatory, since Article VIII of
the BIT draws no distinction between expropriations conducted through executive,
legislative or judicial measures. '°'7 Relying on Rumeii, it submits that “a taking by the
judicial arm of the State may also amount to an expropriation.” 1°" Along the same lines
as its argumentation in respect of FET, the Claimant disputes that judicial measures
can only breach the prohibition against unlawful expropriation under international law if
they constitute a denial of justice, as the Respondent suggests, for the following
reasons. 1019

First, the Claimant argues that the Respondent cannot raise the compliance with its
domestic legal framework as a defense to expropriation. 192° Relying on ATA, the
Claimant submits that “a State cannot invoke its internal laws to evade obligations
imposed by a given treaty or generally by public international law.” 1°21

Second, relying on Biwater, the Claimant asserts that investment tribunals have
repeatedly confirmed that denial of justice is not a requirement for a judicial measure
to amount to an expropriation. '°*2 For instance, in Rumeli, the tribunal held that “the
final decision of Kazakhstan’s Supreme Court affirming the compulsory redemption of
the claimant's shares amounted to unlawful expropriation, even though the decision
was made ‘in accordance with due process of law.” 1°23 In Sistem, the tribunal found
that the invalidation of a share purchase agreement constituted an expropriation
because it had the effect of abrogating the claimant's ownership rights in a hotel. As
noted by the tribunal in Sistem, States are “not immune from liability for this
expropriation simply because the state organs that had carried out the expropriation
were judicial entities.” 1074

Third, the Claimant argues that the cases cited by the Respondent and by Canada are
not material for the present dispute. The tribunal in Azinian did not find that a denial of
justice is always a requirement for a finding of expropriation, but rather that tribunals
can impose international responsibility on a State for multiple types of breaches
including denial of justice. In any event, the Claimant stresses that no judicial measure
was challenged in Azinian.'°5 In the same vein, the Claimant argues that the tribuna

in Loewen did not purport to limit judicial expropriations in all cases to denial of
justice. 176

b. The Claimant’s Rights Were Capable of Expropriation

The Claimant submits that its rights were capable of expropriation. Indeed, Article VIII
of the BIT protects “investments of investors” against unlawful expropriation, which
notion includes the exploitation Concession, the pre-existing mining rights, the shares
in Industrias Infinito, the money lent to Industrias Infinito and invested throughout the
Project's life, the other Project approvals and the property associated with the
Project.'°2”7 The Claimant challenges that it held no valid rights capable of being
expropriated following their annulment by the Costa Rican courts. 1°78

The Claimant further submits that the Respondentis estopped fromraising the illegality
of such rights as a defense in this arbitration. 1°29 Indeed, Costa Rica’s Government —
through the acts of SETENA, SINAC, DGM, MINAE, various Ministers, the President of
Costa Rica and the Constitutional Chamber — led the Claimant to believe that its rights
were valid by upholding them and encouraging Infinito to carry on with the Project. 102°
More precisely, the Claimant argues that “[i]f the 2002 Moratorium applied to the
[P]roject, then the Government should not have restored the exploitation concession,
granted the EIA, declared the [P]roject to be in the national interest, or granted the
change of land use permit.”'°9' Further, the Claimant stresses that its witness, Mr.
Agiero, confirmed that the Government understood that Industrias Infinito had valid
rights. 1032

According to Infinito, its position is echoed by various arbitral decisions. In particular,
the tribunal in ADC rejected the State’s argument that the relevant agreements were
illegal because it had performed these agreements for several years.1°3 In
Kardassopoulos, the tribunal dismissed the respondents’ illegality argument as the
State had endorsed the investment. 1°4

In the alternative, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s argument only applies to
the resolutions granting Industrias Infinito its Concession and other key approvals. The
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision did not affect the pre-existing mining rights.
Rather, the 2012 MINAET Resolution expropriated the Claimant's pre-mining rights by

archiving Industrias Infinito’s file in the Mining Registry and declaring the Crucitas area
free of mining rights in accordance with the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. '°°5

Contrary to the Respondent's contentions, Industrias Infinito’s pre-existing mining rights
were capable of expropriation for two reasons. First, pursuant to Articles 23 and 26 of
the Mining Code, “an exploration permit holder becomes entitled as of right to an
exploitation concession once it proves the existence of an exploitable deposit and
meets defined statutory conditions,” 13° a matter on which the Respondent's expert,
Dr. Léon expressed no opinion. '°°”

Second, it is not true that Industrias Infinito’s exploration permit had expired. Relying
on Dr. Araya’s expert report, the Claimant submits that “[a]ln exploration permit expires
only if the permit holder fails to apply for an exploitation concession within sixty days of
the permit’s expiry, not if its conditions are met and the permit holder moves onto the
next stage in the process.” 1°38 Industrias Infinito was thus an exploration permit holder
that had applied for an exploitation concession and its prior rights remained
acquired. 1039

c. The Respondent Expropriated the Claimant’s Investments

(i) The Expropriation Was Direct and Indirect

The Claimant argues that, by annulling the Claimant’s rights, the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision permanently deprived Infinito of its investments in Costa Rica. 14°
The Claimant contends that this expropriation was both direct and indirect.1°'

a. Direct Expropriation

It is the Claimant's submission that, through the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision, the Respondent directly expropriated (i) the exploitation Concession, (ii) other
project approvals, and (iii) its pre-existing mining rights. 1°42

According to the Claimant, the cancellation of its Concession is a classic case of direct
expropriation. Infinito defines the Concession as “a bundle of legal rights to which
Industrias Infinito became entitled in 2001, when it proved the existence of a gold
deposit at Crucitas [...] and had complied with all of its obligations as an exploration
permit holder.” The Claimant argues that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision

took these rights away from Industrias Infinito and thereby expropriated the
Concession. 1°49

The other project approvals are likewise “bundles of legal rights that conferred on
Industrias Infinito certain rights in connection with the development, construction and
operation of the Crucitas gold mine,” including the 2005 EIA approval, the 2005
declaration of environmental viability and the 2008 approval of project modifications
and granting of environmental viability. 1°44 For the Claimant, the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision also directly expropriated these rights. 1045

That said, the Claimant argues that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision did not
impact its pre-existing mining rights because “[i]f the final act, such as the resolution
granting a concession, is annulled, the rights-holder reverts to the position it was in
immediately before the final act was granted.”'°° Accordingly, the Claimant was
entitled under its exploration permit to apply for a new concession and new project
approvals in order to carry out the Crucitas Project. '°4” However, the 2012 MINAET
Resolution expropriated the pre-mining rights by extinguishing them. Moreover, the
2011 Legislative Mining Ban barred open-pit mining and thereby prevented the
Claimant from obtaining new rights to build and operate the Crucitas mine. 1°48

b. Indirect Expropriation

The Claimant submits that the Respondent indirectly expropriated its other
investments, including its shares in Industrias Infinito, the funds it invested into its
subsidiary and the property associated with the Crucitas Project.

More precisely, the Claimant argues that with the loss of Industrias Infinito’s
Concession and related rights, the Claimant's other investments immediately became
substantially and permanently worthless.'%9 The Claimant stresses that Industrias
Infinito’s share value began to fall on 30 November 2011 because of the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision and dropped to zero in March 2013. 1°5° Relying on
the expert report of FTI, the Claimant submits that the fall in Industrias Infinito’s share
value shows “the market's perception of the magnitude of the impact of the alleged
wrongful acts on Infinito’s investment.”1051

(ii) The Expropriation Is Not Justified Under the Police Powers
Doctrine

The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent that a tribunal must take into account the
State’s goal in assessing whether it has expropriated the investor's investments.
Rather, the Claimant argues that the test is entirely objective and consists in assessing
whether the host State deprived the investor of its investment or altered the economic
value of these investments. 1°52

According to the Claimant and contrary to the Respondent's contentions, the police
powers doctrine is narrow and does not apply in the present case because the
challenged measures served no public purpose.

a. There Is No Broad “Public Purpose” Exception to Expropriation

For the Claimant, the Respondent's broad definition of the public purpose exception,
under which any measure adopted for public interest or in good faith is covered by this
exception, is inconsistent with the BIT and with the jurisprudence. 1°?

First, the Claimant emphasizes that an expropriation is lawful when it meets four
requirements, including that it serves a public purpose. Following Costa Rica’s
arguments, it would escalate the public purpose requirement from a condition for a
lawful expropriation to a bar to a finding of expropriation, irrespective of the other
preconditions. 1°

Second, the Claimant submits that, as noted in Quiborax, Burlington, Tecmed and
Saluka, the police powers doctrine is narrow. '°55 Relying on the decision in Vivendi II,
the Claimant argues that “[i]f public purpose automatically immuni[zJes measures from
being found to be expropriatory, then there would never be a compensable taking fora
public purpose.” 1°56 Most investment arbitration decisions held that the police powers
doctrine only applies when the measure (i) is truly necessary and proportionate to its
stated rationale; (ii) is not contrary to the investor’s legitimate expectations; (iii) does
not otherwise breach international obligations; or (iv) isnot contrary to domestic law. 1°57

Infinito further notes that the Respondent has not referred to any case in support of its
argument “that any measure aimed at general welfare and adopted in good faith will be
exempted from to [sic] Article VIII's prohibition against unlawful expropriation, unless it
is ‘obviously disproportionate’.”15° In Philip Morris and in Chemtura, the tribunals

accepted that the respondent States had exercised their police powers because the
measures were required to prevent scientifically established harm to public health.
Likewise, in Saluka, the respondent's banking system was at stake. 1°59

Finally, relying on Santa Elena, the Claimant submits that “[e]xpropriatory
environmental measures — no matter how laudable or beneficial to society as a whole
— are in this respect, similar to any other expropriatory measures that a state may
implement in order to implement its policies: where property is expropriated, even for
environmental purposes, whether domestic or international, the state’s obligation to pay
compensation remains.” 106°

b. The Police Powers Doctrine Has No Application in the Present
Case

In any event, the Claimant denies that the Respondent adopted the challenged
measures in good faith and for the legitimate purpose of protecting the environment.1°

First, the Claimant argues that there is no evidence on record establishing that the
Crucitas Project was harmful for the environment. To the contrary, the Claimant
stresses that Costa Rica’s authorities, including SETENA, SINAC and the
Constitutional Chamber, found that the Project was consistent with Costa Rican
environmental law. In the same vein, the Claimant puts forward that the executive
branch defended the Crucitas Project before the Costa Rican courts. Finally, the
Claimant argues that the 2002 Moratorium and the 2012 MINAET Resolution merely
reflect a change in policy following the election of President Chinchilla. 1°62

Second, the Claimant submits that Costa Rica enacted the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban
(i) in violation of the Political Constitution and (ii) to prevent the Crucitas Project from
proceeding. 1°63

Third, Infinito emphasizes that the Respondent's “recent conduct belies its argument
that concern for the environment motivated the cancellation of the Crucitas
[P]roject.” 1° Indeed, as noted by President Arias, “[t]he environmental devastation
caused by the illegal mining in Crucitas is a tragedy that, unfortunately, we could have

avoided.” 1°65 The Claimant contends that Costa Rica did nothing to prevent these
illegal activities and the resulting harm to the environment. 1°

On this basis, the Claimant argues that the Respondent did not establish that the
measures were proportionate and necessary to protect the environment, and thus the
expropriation is not exempted under the police powers doctrine. 1°”

d. The Expropriation Was Unlawful

The Claimant submits that the expropriation did not meet the legality requirement set
in Article VIII of the BIT.

First, the expropriation was not for a public purpose. Relying on the decision in ADC
and on ILC reports, the Claimant explains that this condition “requires some genuine
interest of the public” and is not a self-judging standard. 1° The 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision and the 2012 MINAET Resolution, however served no public
purpose, '°69 as “[f]ar from having achieved any social good, the cancellation of the
Crucitas gold mine has deprived an already economically depressed community of
jobs, revenue, and social and physical infrastructure.”1°7°

Second, the expropriation was not completed in accordance with due process. Invoking
ADC, the Claimant argues that “‘due process of law’, in the expropriation context,
demands an actual and substantive legal procedure fora foreign investor to raise its
claims against the depriving actions already taken or about to be taken against it.”1°”"
Industrias Infinito had no knowledge, so says the Claimant, that it would have to submit
arguments as to the application of the 2002 Moratorium to the 2008 Concession.
Indeed, this issue was not part of the complaint filed before the TCA. As a result,
Industrias Infinito only had the opportunity to make brief submissions on this issue. The
Claimant further argues that the Administrative Chamber did not cure this procedural
flaw “given that the Administrative Chamber proceeding was an appeal rather than a
hearing at first instance.” 1°72

Third, the Claimant draws attention to the fact that Costa Rica has paid no
compensation to Industrias Infinito or to the Claimant, contrary to Article VIII of the BIT

which requires the payment of a compensation equivalent to the fair market value of

The Respondent’s Position

a. The Claimant Had No Mining Rights Capable of Expropriation

The Respondent submits that “[t]here can be no expropriation of a right that does not
exist” in the first place. '°’4 Invoking the award in Vestey, the Respondent submits that
“[flor a private person to have a claim under international law arising from the
deprivation of its property it must hold that property in accordance with applicable rules
of domestic law.” '°”5 Likewise, the tribunal in EnCana ruled that “for there to have been
an expropriation of an investment or retum [...] the rights affected must exist under the
law which creates them, in this case, the law of Ecuador.” '°76

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant had no valid mining right because (i)
the 2010 TCA Decision confirmed that the 2002 Concession was null ab initio and that
Industrias Infinito had no right covered by the 2002 Moratorium grandfathering
provision, and (ii) the 2008 Concession was granted when the 2002 Moratorium was
still in effect.1077

Contrary to the Claimant's submission, the Respondent asserts that the same is true
of Industrias Infinito’s alleged pre-existing mining rights. As a preliminary matter, the
Respondent argues that the Claimant’s position on this point is unclear, as it argued in
its Memorial that the expropriatory measure was the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision, and later in its Reply that it was the 201 1 Legislative Mining Ban and the 2012
MINAET Resolution. 1°78

In any event, the Respondent considers that Industrias Infinito had no pre-existing
mining rights since an exploration permit holder is not entitled as of right to an
exploitation concession, as confirmed by the TCA and Dr. Leon, 1°’? and Industrias
Infinito’s exploration permit expired in September 1999. '°8° The Respondent stresses

that this fact was not disputed until the Claimant's Reply, and that the Claimant's
witness Mr. Juan Carlos Hernandez admitted that the exploration permit had expired in
1999. 1081

The Respondent adds that, even assuming that Industrias Infinito had held pre-existing
mining rights, the outcome would still have been same. The 2012 MINAET Resolution
and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban had no impact on those alleged rights, °°? as the
2010 Executive Moratoria, which entered into force in 2010 before the cut-off date
under the BIT, already prevented the Claimant from applying for anew concession. In
other words, “irrespective of the Legislative Moratorium and the 2012 MINAE
Resolution, Industrias Infinito could not have obtained an exploitation concession
following the annulment of its 2008 Concession.” 1983

The Respondent further contends that “the Claimant's lack of any valid mining right also
defeats its indirect expropriation claim.” 1&4 This is because the value of the assets
allegedly subjected to indirect expropriation depended on the validity of the 2008
Concession and related rights.

b. The Respondent Is Not Estopped from Arguing that the Claimant’s
Rights Were not Valid

The Respondent disputes being estopped from relying on the invalidity of the
Claimant’s rights because its executive branch spent a decade upholding the validity
of such rights. 1985

First, Costa Rica asserts that “[t]he [...] decade to which the Claimant refers inits Reply
was a stretch of unremitting uncertainty about the validity of Industrias Infinito's
purported mining rights.”'°® It underlines that between the granting of the 2002
Concession and the annulment in 2010 of the 2008 Concession, various proceedings
were initiated as to the validity of the Claimant’s rights: On 1 April 2002, environmenta
activists filed an amparo against the 2002 Concession, which led to its annulment in
2004; the 2008 Concession was also immediately suspended by the filing of amparo
petitions; from 12 June 2002 to 4 June 2008 and from 29 April 2010 onwards, open-pit
mining was prohibited by either the 2002 Moratorium, the 2010 Executive Moratoria or
the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, which demonstrates that “there was no abrupt change
in the conditions of the mining activity.” 1°87

During this period, Costa Rica’s executive branch never represented to the Claimant
that (i) its rights were exempt from legal or judicial scrutiny or that (ii) the judicial branch
would necessarily confirm the legality of its rights. 1°88 To the contrary, “[t]he fact that
some administrative agencies worked to advance the Crucitas Mining Project only
reaffirms that Costa Rica acted in good faith in respect of the Claimant’s
investment.” 108

Second, the Respondent argues that the cases which the Claimant cites are inapposite
as they all relate to the admissibility of a jurisdictional objection based on the alleged
illegality of the investor’s investment. 199° For Costa Rica, the estoppel theory is not
applicable here since it “can neither create rights that did not exist, nor make the
Tribunal ignore the fact that the alleged rights in question were declared void in fair
judicial proceedings before the Costa Rican Courts.” 1%" Further, in Kardassopoubs,
Railroad Development and Fraport, the objection to jurisdiction was not admissible
because both parties conducted themselves for years as if the relevant agreements
were legal. Here, Costa Rica did not conduct itself as if the 2008 Concession was legal
and never represented so to the Claimant. 1°92

Third, invoking Arif, the Respondent submits that “Costa Rica cannot be held liable at
an international level for the correct application by Costa Rican Courts of Costa Rican
law in lawsuits filed by a third party.”'°95 Otherwise, a State would be denied the
possibility to review the legality of executive measures, which would be inconsistent
with the separation of powers. According to the Respondent, “[i]f every declaration of
annulment of an illegally granted concession following fair judicial proceedings could
be considered as an expropriation, States would be unable to enforce their laws against
investors.” 10%

Fourth, the Respondent denies that the Government misled the Claimant into making
further investments in the Project. In the alternative, the Respondent argues that the
Costa Rican judicial system provided the Claimant with a mechanism to dispel any
doubt as to whether the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision annulled the 2002
Concession with absolute or relative effects. The Respondent cites in this regard the
decision in Amto, pursuant to which “[an] investor that fails to exercise his rights within
a legal system, or exercises its rights unwisely, cannot pass his own responsibility for

the outcome to the administration of justice, and from there to the host State in
international law.” 1095

c. Judicial Measures Cannot Constitute an Expropriation

The Respondent and Canada submit that judicial measures cannot constitute an
expropriation because “in [the] absence of a denial of justice, there is no basis for an
international tribunal to interfere with a domestic court’s determination of what rights
exist at domestic law.” 1096

Relying on the legal test laid down in Azinian, the Respondent submits that, to find that
the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision expropriated the Claimant’s investments,
the Tribunal must be convinced that (i) domestic legal standards violate Costa Rica’s
international law obligations under the BIT; (ii) the Costa Rican courts themselves are
disavowed at the international level (for instance, as a result of a denial of justice); or
(iii) the Costa Rican courts were not only wrong with respect to the invalidity of the 2008
Concession, but there has been a pretense of form to achieve an internationally
unlawful end. According to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to meet this test. It
has not argued that the legal framework on which the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision was grounded was expropriatory, nor has it proved a denial of justice or a
pretense of form to achieve an internationally wrongful end. 1°97

d. The Respondent’s Measures are Covered by the Police Powers Doctrine

It is the Respondent’s case that all of the impugned measures were “bona fide,
proportionate regulations aimed at the general welfare.” As a result, they represented
a legitimate use of the State’s police powers and could not give rise to a claim for
expropriation. 10%

The Respondentfurther submits that the police powers doctrine “protects a State’s right
to regulate and to exercise its police power in the interests of public welfare.”'°%9 Relying
on Philip Morris, S.D. Myers, Saluka and LG&E, the Respondent argues that a measure
is valid under this doctrine if (i) it is adopted in good faith; (ii) it is not obviously
disproportionate; and (iii) it aims at the general welfare. 11°

Costa Rica disagrees with the Claimant that the police powers doctrine cannot exempt
a State of liability because the standard of lawful expropriation already requires the
measures to be adopted for a “public purpose.” It argues that the police powers doctrine

has been recognized as a stand-alone exception which requires an assessment of the
“nature of purpose of the State’s action.”"'°' In reliance on Feldman, Chemtura and
Canada’s recent treaty practice, the Respondent submits that the protection of the
environment falls within the police powers doctrine. 11°

The Respondent further submits that, contrary to the Claimant’s arguments, the first
step in the analysis is not whether there has been a deprivation of the Claimant’s
investment and if that deprivation was permanent. In the two cases cited by the
Claimant (Quiborax and Burlington), the tribunal chose to start with the assessment of
the third requirement, namely whether the measure was a legitimate exercise of the
police powers doctrine. 11

According to the Respondent, the challenged measures (the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision, the 2012 MINAET Resolution and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban)
fall within the police powers doctrine, because they were bona fide, proportionate and
aimed at the general welfare. ‘1° These measures “were all taken in order to maintain
or enforce priormeasures that had the overriding purpose of protecting the environment
from the possible negative effects of open-pit mining.”"'°° Specifically, the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2012 MINAET Resolution both upheld
measures whose aim was to protect the environment. Indeed, they both maintained
and enforced the 2010 TCA Decision, which in turn had confirmed the application of
the 2002 Moratorium to the 2002 Concession as a result of the Constitutiond
Chamber's annulment of that concession in 2004. 11° As for the 2011 Legislative Mining
Ban, it was issued as a safeguard against a possible repeat of the 2010 Executive
Moratoria and, like those Moratoria, was motivated by legitimate concerns about the
environmental impact of open-pit mining. 11°”

In contrast to the Claimant’s position, it is not necessary for Costa Rica to prove that
the Crucitas Project would have been harmful for the environment; it is sufficient for it
to demonstrate that Costa Rican courts applied the laws and regulations correctly.11°8
The Respondent argues in this respect that the challenged measures were based
primarily on the 2002 Moratorium, which sought to “ensure a balance between the
activities and their possible consequences on the environment, aimed at the protection

of human health, and the natural, economic and social equilibrium.” ''°9 In any event,
the record shows that the Crucitas Project gave rise to numerous environmenta
concerns. 1110

The Respondent further denies that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban is unconstitutional
and thus cannot result from the exercise of police powers. In 2013, the Constitutional
Chamber declared the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban constitutional because “it was of
general application, [...] applied prospectively, contained a transitory provision that
respected acquired rights, and was based on objective and technical evidence to
conclude that open-pit mining represented a risk to public health and the
environment.” '""' Dr. Calzada’s opinion must be disregarded, so says Costa Rica, as
her analysis of the compatibility of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban with the principles
of precaution and equality is flawed. 1112

The Respondentalso opposes the Claimant’s view that “Costa Rica has done very little
to address illegal mining” ever since.'''? To the contrary, “Costa Rica has actively
sought to eradicate the illegal mining activities in the Crucitas Mining Project site with
a view to preventing environmental damage.” '""4

e. There Is No Causal Link Between the Loss or Damage and the Allegedly
Expropriatory Measures

The Respondent submits that, for an expropriation to occur under international law,
“[t]he investor must be deprived of all or nearly all of the benefits and value of the
investment.” '''5 The investor must also “identify the necessary causal link between the
substantial loss or near destruction of the value of the investment and the challenged
measure that allegedly led to that loss or radical deprivation.” '"'° According to the
Respondent, the Claimant has failed to establish that the challenged measures (the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2012 MINAET Resolution, and the 2011
Legislative Mining Ban) are the cause of the deprivation of its investment.1117

According to the Respondent, the evidence shows that the loss occurred with the 2010
TCA Decision and not at a later date, ''® which the Claimant actually recognized ina
press release. 1119

The Respondent further points out that, at the jurisdictional stage, the Claimant
attempted to circumvent the question of causation by arguing that it had suffered a
composite breach and a creeping expropriation, as a result of which “there [was] no
need to establish separate losses that are tied to each individual measure.”1120
However, the Claimant is nowarguing that the present case is a “‘classic case’ of direct
expropriation.” ‘121 This cannot be the case, since an expropriation cannot be at the
same time direct, indirect and creeping.''2? The Respondent concludes that, under the
Claimant’s own theory, there is no composite breach; rather, the Claimant's case is
based on a single measure, namely the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. ''2

As to the alleged expropriation of Industrias Infinito’s pre-existing mining rights, the
Respondentreiterates that no such rights existed. ''24 Even assuming that the Claimant
had pre-existing mining rights that would have allowed it to request a new exploitation
concession (quod non), “the 2010 Executive Moratoria had already imposed a ban on
open-pit mining.” ‘125 Accordingly, even absent the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and the
2012 MINAET Resolution, Industrias Infinito could not have obtained an exploitation
concession following the annulment of the 2008 Concession. 1126

Canada’s Position

Canada submits that the expropriation standard under the BIT, reflects customary
international law and forms part of the customary international law minimum standard
of treatment. ‘127 Itnotes that, fora measure to amount to an expropriation under Article
VIII of the BIT, “there must be a taking of fundamental ownership rights, either directly
or indirectly, that causes a substantial deprivation of economic value of the
investment.” 1128

According to Canada, the first step in an expropriation analysis is the identification of
the investment allegedly expropriated.''29 When determining legal entitlements under
domestic law, international tribunals should defer to domestic court rulings. ‘13° Canada
further considers that “a non-discriminatory measure that is designed to protect
legitimate public welfare objectives does not constitute indirect expropriation, except in
rare circumstances where its impacts are so severe in the light of its purpose that it
cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith.” 151

Analysis

The Tribunal will first set out the standard for expropriation (a). It will then address
whether there has been a direct expropriation (b) and/or an indirect expropriation of the
Claimant’s investments (c). In the affirmative, the Tribunal will determine whether the
expropriation was unlawful (d).

a. The Standard for Expropriation
Article VIII of the Costa Rica-Canada BIT provides: 1132

Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be
nationalized, expropriated or subjected to measures having an effect
equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as
‘expropriation’) in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except fora
public purpose, under due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner
and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such
compensation shall be based on the fair market value of the investment
expropriated immediately before the expropriation or at the time the
proposed expropriation became public knowledge, whicheveris the earlier.

The Parties appear to be in agreement on the standard for expropriation. The Claimant
has cited the formulation set out in Quiborax and Burlington as to what measures
amount to direct and indirect expropriations, ''5° and the Respondent has not contested
it nor given a different version of the standard.

The Tribunal agrees. A State measure constitutes expropriation if (i) the measure
deprives the investor of its investment; (ii) the deprivation is permanent; and (iii) the
deprivation finds no justification under the police powers doctrine.''*4 An expropriation
is direct when the deprivation occurs through aforcible taking or transfer of the property

to the State.1'55 It is indirect when the measure “substantially interfere[s] with the
investor’s ability to use or derive the economic benefits from an investment established
in the territory of the host State, even if it is not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the
host State.” 1156

If a measure amounts to an expropriation under such test, the Tribunal must assess
whether the expropriation was lawful. Pursuant to Article VIIl of the BIT, the
expropriation is lawful if it is (i) made for a public purpose, (ii) under due process of law,
(iii) in a non-discriminatory manner and (iv) against prompt, adequate and effective
compensation. These requirements are cumulative, such that failure to meet any one
of them makes the expropriation wrongful.

While the Parties appear to concur on this standard, they diverge on whether ajudicia
decision may effectan expropriation if it does not amount to a denial of justice. For the
reasons given in Section VI.C.1.d(iii) supra (on FET), amajority of the Tribunal answers
this question in the affirmative, provided that the requirements for an expropriation set
out in paragraph 699 supra are met.

b. Has There Been a Direct Expropriation of the Claimant’s Investments?

The Claimant argues that, through the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the
2012 MINAET Resolution, Costa Rica directly expropriated its Concession, project
approvals and pre-existing mining rights.''87 The Respondent retorts that no
expropriation could have taken place, because the Claimant did nothold rights capable
of being expropriated, the judicial measures did not constitute a denial of justice, and
the measures were adopted in accordance with the police powers doctrine to enforce
underlying measures aimed at protecting the environment against open-pit mining
activities.

At paragraph 175 supra, the Tribunal has held that the 2008 Concession and Industrias
Infinito’s other pre-existing mining rights did not qualify as “investments” of the Claimant
under Article I(g) of the Treaty, because they are assets controlled indirectly by the
Claimant through ahost State enterprise that do not fall within the scope of the Treaty’s
definition of investment. Forthe same reason, these assets do not qualify as investment
that can be expropriated directly in breach of Article VIII of the Treaty. While a State
measure resulting in the loss of the 2008 Concession and other rights might potentially
lead to the destruction of value of the shares of Industrias Infinito, this could only qualify
as an indirect expropriation.

The Tribunal is mindful that the Parties have not raised this point. The Respondents
main argument is not that the 2008 Concession does not qualify as a direct investment;
it is that this Concession was not valid under domestic law, and as result was not
capable of being expropriated. The Tribunal will thus address the Claimant's direct

expropriation claim as the Parties have argued it, noting that the outcome would not be
different.

As this claim has been framed by the Parties, the Tribunal must first determine whether
the Claimant (through Industrias Infinito) held rights capable of being expropriated.'"9°
If no valid rights exist under domestic law, there can be no expropriation. 199

As explained in Vestey, the existence of rights subject to expropriation must be
assessed immediately before the adoption of the measures impugned. ''4° The Tribund
will thus assess whether Industrias Infinito held any valid rights immediately before 30
November 2011, the date of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. As discussed
in Section V.D.3.b(i) supra, this is when the annulment became definitive and the
consequent loss of value to the Claimant’s investment became permanent. 1141

The Claimant asserts that the exploitation Concession, project approvals and pre-
existing mining rights forma bundle of rights that qualify as “investments of investors”
under Article I(g) of the BIT and are thus protected under Article VIII.142 The
Respondent, for its part, argues that the Concession and related project approvals were
not validly granted because (i) the 2010 TCA Decision confirmed that the 2002
Concession was null ab initio and that Industrias Infinito had no right covered by the
2002 Moratorium’s grandfathering provision; and (ii) the 2008 Concession was granted
when the 2002 Moratorium was still in effect. ‘149 It also contends that Industrias Infinito
held no valid pre-existing mining rights, as its exploration permit had expired in
September 1999.

As it was already made clear in the analysis of the claims of denial of justice and breach
of FET, for the Tribunal Industrias Infinito held no valid Concession and related
approvals capable of being expropriated. It is undisputed that the 2002 Concession
was annulled by the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision. The TCA regarded this
annulment as absolute, with the result that the 2002 Concession was null and void ab
initio, a finding confirmed by the Administrative Chamber in 2011.

While the Claimant disagrees with the Administrative Chamber's conclusion and argues
that the nullity was only relative, it is common ground that the Government did not
attempt to cure such nullity with a validation or remediation (as requested by Industrias
Infinito), but purported to “convert” the 2002 Concession in 2008. The Tribunal
understands that, if it had been effective, the conversion would have resulted in anew

concession. 1‘44 In other words, a successful conversion would have had the same
effect as the grant of a new concession; it would not have restored the 2002
Concession. There can thus be no doubt that, on 30 November 2011, Industrias Infinito
held no valid rights over the 2002 Concession.

As to the 2008 Concession and related approvals, the TCA held in 2010 (and the
Administrative Chamber upheld a year later) that the conversion had been improper
and that in any event the Government had granted the 2008 Concession and related
approvals while the 2002 Moratorium was still in effect. Accordingly, the TCA annulled
the 2008 Concession and approvals, annulment which was confirmed by the
Administrative Chamber.

As discussed above, the Tribunal must focus on the moment immediately preceding
the Administrative Chamber Decision on 30 November 2011. At that time, the 2008
Concession and related approvals which Industrias Infinito formally held were vitiated
by an absolute nullity. Consequently, Industrias Infinito could not be said to have owned
valid rights capable of being expropriated.

As to Industrias Infinito’s alleged pre-existing mining rights, the Tribunal has already
found at paragraph 573 supra that Industrias Infinito had certain pre-existing mining
rights that arose from its status as an exploration permit holder and that the application
to the Crucitas Project of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban (the MINAET Resolution
being an ancillary measure not independent of the Ban) violated FET. For reasons of
judicial economy, it can be left open whether these pre-existing rights were in addition
subject to an expropriation. Indeed, even in the affirmative, no greater harm could be
caused than the one generated by the FET breach. As noted when discussing the FET
breach, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Claimant has proved the existence of a
quantifiable harm, and finds that that any alleged harm is in any event too speculative
to give rise to an award of damages.

c. Has There Been an Indirect Expropriation of the Claimant’s Remaining
Investments?

The Claimant further contends that the Respondent indirectly expropriated its other
investments in Costa Rica, namely: (i) the shares in Industrias Infinito, which it acquired
in 2000; (ii) the funds it invested in Industrias Infinito; (iii) the physical assets associated
with the Project, including the half-built mining infrastructure; and (iv) the intangible
assets associated with the Project. The Claimant argues that, with the loss of the
Concession, these other investments became substantially and permanently
worthless. 1145

189 (1. The invalid act, absolute or relatively void, may be converted into a different valid one

and material requirements of the latter. 2. The conversion takes effect on its date.)

The Respondent does not dispute that the Claimant validly held these assets prior to
the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the Tribunal has noted as much when
discussing jurisdiction. ‘14° Rather, its case is that the Claimant’s main investment was
the Concession, and that the value of these remaining investments depended on the
Concession.

For present purposes, the Tribunal considers it necessary to distinguish what assets
were held by the Claimant, and which by Industrias Infinito. It appears undisputed that
the Claimant indirectly held the shares in Industrias Infinito through Crucitas (Barbados)
Limited, a corporation incorporated under the laws of Barbados. ''4” The Claimant also
asserts that it invested funds into the Project, butthe record is not clear as to howthese
funds were deployed (e.g., whether they were acapital contribution to Industrias Infinito
or a shareholder loan). As to the physical and intangible assets, the record suggests
that they were owned by Industrias Infinito, ''48 and thus formed part of its share value.
The Tribunal thus finds that the Claimant's other assets should be assessed as part of
Industria’s Infinito’s value.

It is evident from the Claimant’s own case that the exploitation Concession for the
Crucitas Project was the most valuable asset, upon which the value of Industrias
Infinito’s shares (and indeed, of the entire Project) rested. The Claimant’s argument is
that, as a result of the loss of the Concession, Industrias Infinito’s shares were
substantially deprived of their value.

As explained above, fora measure to amount to an indirect expropriation, it must cause
the deprivation of the investment. It is widely accepted that this deprivation must be
substantial, '149 and that there must be a causal link between the measure and the
deprivation. ''5° Here, the Tribunal finds that there was no causal link between the
alleged deprivation and the challenged measures.

The Tribunal agrees that, as a matter of fact, the Claimant's shares in Industrias Infinito
lost their value when the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision annulled the 2008
Concession. But this does not mean that, as a legal matter, the decision caused the
substantial deprivation of the value of Industrias Infinito. The Administrative Chamber
found that the 2008 Concession was vitiated by a legal flaw that rendered it null and
void ab initio. This means that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision merely
confirmed this legal status. Had this decision been rendered in bad faith, in order to
deprive Industrias Infinito of a validly held concession, it would have been open to the

Tribunal to assess whether it was expropriatory. However, this is not the case here: as
discussed in Section VI.C.2.c supra, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision cannot
be characterized as a denial of justice, nor was it fundamentally arbitrary or unfair. It
was a bona fide decision of the Costa Rican Supreme Court that found that Industrias
Infinito did not hold valid rights under Costa Rican law. Accordingly, it cannot be
characterized as an expropriatory measure.

In other words, the value of Industrias Infinito’s shares and other intangibles was
premised on an illusion, i.e. that the mining rights were valid when they were not. In
reality, the Claimant's shares in Industrias Infinito were already worthless prior to the
challenged measures, which can thus not have caused their loss of value.

DID THE RESPONDENT VIOLATE OTHER OBLIGATIONS IMPORTED INTO THE BIT FROM
OTHER TREATIES?

The Claimant’s Position

a. The MEN Clause Allows the Tribunal to Import more Favorable
Substantive Protections from Other Treaties

The Claimant submits that in accordance with “international jurisprudence,” the MFN
clause of the BIT (Article IV), which contains no restrictions in this respect, allows it to
“benefit from ‘more favourable’ substantive protections contained in other treaties
concluded by the host State,” including FET and umbrella clauses. 1151

Infinito disagrees with the Respondent and Canada that the references in Article IV to
“treatment”, “in its territory”, and “in like circumstances,” mean that the MFN standard
is limited to the material treatment of an investor and does not extend to substantive

obligations in other treaties. 1152

Further, the Claimant contends that its position does not disregard the BIT drafters’
intent. Invoking White Industries, it submits that its position “does not ‘subvert’ the
negotiated balance of the BIT,” but that “it achieves exactly the result which the parties
intended by the incorporation in the BIT of an MFN clause.” 1153

b. The Respondent Failed to Do “What Is Necessary” to Protect the
Claimant’s Investment

On the basis of Article IV of the BIT, the Claimant cites Article 3 of the Costa Rica-
French Republic BIT under which the host State must “do what is necessary so that the
exercise of the right so recognized is not impaired either in law or in fact,” 1"*4 arguing

that it should benefit from this protection beyond the BIT’s FET standard. ‘55 It further
explains that “[tlo comply with this standard, Costa Rica should have taken positive
steps to protect Infinito’s investments, and in particular to protect the exploitation
concession and the other project approvals.”'"5° To the extent that this positive
obligation is not already part of the FET standard provided for in the BIT, “this provision
does provide additional protection.” 1157

According to the Claimant, Costa Rica failed to grant such additional protection.1158
Specifically, (i) it did not grant Industrias Infinito new rights to allow the exploitation of
the Crucitas mine; (ii) it did not repeal the Moratoria on open-pit mining; and (iii) it did
not provide amechanism to address the inconsistencies between the decisions issued
by the Supreme Court’s Chambers. 1159

c. The Respondent Failed to Comply with Specific Obligations

Looking to Article IV of the BIT, Infinito invokes the umbrella clauses found in the
Respondent's treaties with Taiwan and Korea, pursuant to which the host State “shall
comply with [or observe] any obligation assumed regarding investments of investors of
the other Contracting Party.” 11° As these umbrella clauses refer to “any obligation,” the
Claimant argues that the Respondent must comply with “obligations of any nature,
regardless of their source, provided that they are indeed obligations entered into with a
particular investor with regard to his or her investment.” 116

In the Claimant’s submission, by granting Industrias Infinito a Concession, Costa Rica
assumed the specific obligation to grant Industrias Infinito the exclusive right to exploit
the Crucitas mine, which it breached by annulling the Concession, thereby breaching
the umbrella clauses. ''62

The Respondent’s Position

a. The MEN Clause Does Not Allow the Claimant to Benefit from More
Favorable Substantive Obligations Contained in Other Treaties

The Respondent submits that the MFN clause in Article IV(a) of the BIT is not a “treaty-
shopping device” but a substantive obligation. ''® The Respondent argues that the

protection provided in this clause is subject to three cumulative requirements: the
investor must (i) identify an appropriate comparator, chiefly an investment of another
investor that is in “like circumstances;” (ii) establish that its investment is being granted
treatmentin the Respondent's territory that is “less favourable” than that afforded to the
comparator investment in connection to the “enjoyment, use, management, conduct,
operation, expansion, and sale or other disposition” of the investment; and, (iii)
establish that the less favorable treatment which it has received is not objectively
justified. 1"%4

Relying on Parkerings, Bayindir and ic¢kale, the Respondent explains that an investor
can only benefit from the MFN standard if it has established that all the foregoing
requirements are met. ‘6 In the present case, the Claimant failed to establish any of
these requirements; it has merely identified provisions contained in other treaties that
are allegedly more favorable. ‘6° However, the Respondent argues that granting the
nationals of another State more favorable substantive guarantees does not qualify as
“treatment” within the ordinary meaning of Article IV.116” Relying on Canada’s Non-
Disputing Party Submission, the Respondent describes the standard in Article IV as
follows:

In contrast to the ordinary meaning of the term ‘treatment, treaty standards

are not behaviour in respect of an entity or a person. Thus, absent

measures adopted or maintained by a Contracting Party, substantive

obligations and procedural rights in other international treaties do not

automatically convert to ‘treatment’ for the purposes of the MFN obligation

and cannot, themselves, give rise to a breach of Article IV(a)."*

As a result, the Respondent alleges that the MFN clause does not allow the Claimant
“to rewrite the terms of the BIT, by attempting to import Costa Rica’s substantive
obligations in other treaties.” 1169

b. The Respondent Did Not Breach the Alleged Obligation to “Do What is
Necessary”

(i) The Claimant Has Failed to Show that Article 3 of the France-
Costa Rica BIT Affords Investors More Favorable Treatment

The Respondent denies that the Claimant is entitled to invoke Article 3 of the France-
Costa Rica BIT, because this clause does not afford more favorable protection than

Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. 117° The former provision speaks of the “exercise of the right
so recognized,” which refers back to the right to be treated fairly and equitably
addressed in the first part of Article 3.1171 Calling on the award in Lahoud, the
Respondent argues that the two parts of Article 3 relate to the same test and that the
obligation to “do what is necessary” therefore does not “place any more onerous an
obligation on Costa Rica than that already required under the FET clause in the BIT.”""72

The Respondent further asserts that the FET standard in the France-Costa Rica BIT is
limited to treatment “through its legislation” (“por medio de su legislacién” / “[a] travers
sa législation”). Consequently, the FET standard of the French BIT is no more favorable
than the FET standard of the applicable Treaty. 117°

(ii) The Respondent Has Not Failed to “Do What is Necessary”

The Respondent denies that the obligation to “do what is necessary” requires the host
State to “take positive steps” to protect an investor’s investment. To the contrary, Article
3 of the French BIT provides for a less burdensome obligation that consists in doing
“what is necessary so that the Claimant's right to [FET] [...] is not hindered, either in
law or in fact.”1174

That said, the Respondent argues that the Claimant could not reasonably have
expected the State to “(i) disregard[ ] the fact that the Claimant’s investment was
fundamentally illegal under Costa Rican law; (ii) refrain[ ] from exercising its sovereign
right and executive powers to protect the environment; and (iii) [...] go[ ] as far as to
overhaulits judicial system.” 175 The Claimant fails to address Costa Rica’s arguments,
and merely affirms that Costa Rica failed to “do what is necessary” because it did not
redress the inconsistency and unfairness of the judgment of its courts and that, it
permanently deprived the Claimant of its mining rights by issuing the 2012 MINAET
Resolution and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. For the Respondent, these arguments
are flawed because “no reasonable interpretation of the obligation to ‘do what is
necessary’ would require Costa Rica to exempt foreign investments from the
application of domestic law,” and because no tribunal has interpreted this provision in
this way. 1176

In any event, the Respondent argues that this claim is unfounded because (i) the 2011
Legislative Mining Ban had no impact on Industrias Infinito due to the 2010 Executive

Moratoria and (ii) Industrias Infinito had no pre-mining rights anymore since the
expiration of its exploration permit. 1"7”

c. The Respondent Never Assumed or Breached Any “Specific Obligation”
According to Costa Rica, it has never assumed or breached any “specific obligation.”

First, it submits that the BIT Contracting States did not intend to protect investors
against the breach of specific obligations, since the BIT contains no umbrella clause.
An investor should not be allowed to import an entirely new right into a treaty, which
amounts to unilaterally modifying an international treaty, contrary to the drafters’
intent. ‘"78 In reliance on Teinver, the Respondent argues that “the parties to the Treaty
were in all likelihood aware of the existence of umbrella clauses and if they had
intended to include such a clause in the Treaty, they would have done so.”1'79 By
contrast, the Respondent contends that the decision in White Industries to which the
Claimant refers provides no guidance for present purposes, as India did not raise the
same argumentas Costa Rica, namely that MFN clauses cannot be used to import new
rights. 1180

Second, the Respondent alleges that it has “never assumed the specific obligation on
which the Claimant's argument is premised,” "8! because the 2008 Concession has
been found null and void ab initio in accordance with domestic law. 118

Third, the Respondent challenges that Infinito was entitled to rely on the 2008
Concession’s validity. As argued in the context of FET, the Claimant could not have
held any legitimate expectation that its Concession would be exempt from legal
defects. 1183

Canada’s Position

In its Non-Disputing Party Submission, Canada makes two main submissions with
respect to the BIT’s MFN clause.

First, it submits that Article V(a) of the BIT requires a comparison between the
treatment accorded to the investment of an investor of a Contracting Party and the
treatment accorded to the investment of an investor of a third State. According to
Canada, the purpose of this provision which, cannot be applied in the abstract, is to

prohibit nationality-based discrimination against investors of the Contracting Party. The
investor bears the burden of proving that: “(1) the Contracting Party has granted both
the investments of the investor and an investor of a third State ‘treatment’ with respect
to ‘the enjoyment, use, management, conduct, operation, expansion, and sale or
disposition’ of their investments; (2) the alleged treatment was granted ‘in like
circumstances’; and (3) the treatment accorded to the investments of the investor was
‘less favourable’ than the treatment accorded to the investment of the investor of a third
State.” 1184

Second, Canada argues that, when interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the
VCLT, Article IV(a) of the BIT does not allow for the importation of substantive or
procedural rights in other treaties, nor was this the Parties’ intention. The term
“treatment” refers to measures adopted or maintained (i.e., “taken or not taken”) by the
Contracting Party, which is confirmed by the wording of other treaty provisions, such
as Article XII (which refers to claims by an investor “that a measure taken or not taken
by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement”), and Article XII(2)(b)
of the BIT (which provides that when an investor submits a claim, it bears the burden
of proving, inter alia, “that the measure taken or not taken by the Contracting Party is
in breach of this Agreement.”). 1185

The fact that “treatment” refers to actual measures and not to standards is also
corroborated by the reference in Article lV(a) toa comparison in respect of “investments
in its territory of investors of a third State.” According to Canada, this “reflects the
Contracting Parties’ intention that the MFN obligation apply to activities in their territory,
which is distinct from the dispute settlement procedures and substantive treaty
standards that are contained in other international treaties.” ''®° Canada further notes
that several international investment tribunals have recognized that the phrase “in its
territory” is inconsistent with an interpretation of the MFN clause that expands the scope
of international arbitration beyond what is explicitly provided for in the treaty.

Canada further notes that the chapeau of Article IV provides that the “treatment” must
be “with respect to investments and the enjoyment, use, management, conduct,
operation, expansion, and sale or other disposition thereof.” Treaty standards are not
“treatment”, says Canada, because they are not behavior in respect of an entity or a
person. Thus, “absent measures adopted or maintained by a Contracting Party,
substantive obligations and procedural rights in other international treaties do not
automatically convert to ‘treatment’ for the purposes of the MFN obligation and cannot,
themselves, give rise to a breach of Article IV(a).” 1187

1190

For Canada, the context of Article IV(a) of the BIT confirms this interpretation. The BIT
was concluded before Maffezini held that more favorable dispute settlement provisions
could be imported via the MFN clause, and Canada’s subsequent treaty practice
confirms that the term “treatment” does not encompass dispute settlement procedures,
and that substantive obligations in other treaties do not in themselves amount to
“treatment” that could give rise to a breach of the MFN clause. 118°

Analysis

a. No Need to Determine Whether the MFN Clause Allows the Importation
of More Favorable Protections

Article IV(a) of the BIT provides for the most-favored nation (MFN) treatment in the
following terms: 1189

With respect to investments and the enjoyment, use, management,
conduct, operation, expansion, and sale or other disposition thereof, each
Contracting Party shall accord treatment no less favourable than that
which, in like circumstances, it grants in respect of:

(a) investments in its territory of investors of a third State;

(b) investments in its territory of its own investors.

On this basis, the Claimant seeks to rely on two substantive obligations from other
treaties: (i) the obligation to do “what is necessary” to protect an investor’s investments
found in Article 3 of the Costa Rica-France BIT; and (ii) an umbrella clause requiring
the State to “comply with [or observe] any obligation assumed regarding investments
of investors of the other Contracting Party,” contained in Article 3(2) of the Taiwan-
Costa Rica BIT and Article 10(3) of the Korea-Costa Rica BIT. The Respondent and
Canada deny that the Claimant may “import” obligations from other treaties, because
the reference in Article IV(a) to “treatment,” “in its territory” and “in like circumstances”
means that the MFN clause is limited to the material treatment of an investor and does
not extend to substantive obligations in other treaties.119°

The Tribunal considers that it can dispense with resolving the Parties’ divergence on
whether the MFN clause entitles an investor to import a more favorable protection found
in a third party treaty into the basic treaty, i.e. the BIT, or whether the investor must
show an actual difference in treatment between hinVherself and another investor who
is in like circumstances. Indeed, even assuming that the importation of a more favorable
guarantee were sufficient, i.e. assuming that Infinito’s theory prevails, the latter’s claim
would still fail under the terms of the BIT and the facts on record.

b. Does the Obligation “To Do What is Necessary” to Protect the
Claimant’s Investments Provide Additional Protection to the Claimant?

Even assuming that the BIT’s MFNclause allowed the Claimant to import the obligation
to “do what is necessary so that the exercise of the right so recognized is not impaired
either in law or in fact” contained at Article 3 of the Costa Rica-France BIT,"'%" the
Tribunal does not find that it provides additional protection in the present case.

The full text of Article 3 of the France-Costa Rica BIT provides as follows:

Cada una de las Partes contratantes, por medio de su legislacion, se
compromete a garantizar en su territorio y en sus zonas maritimas un
tratamiento justo y equitativo conforme a los principios del Derecho
Internacional, para las inversiones de los nacionales y sociedades de la
otra Parte y a hacer lo necesario para que el ejercicio del derecho asi
reconocido no se vea obstaculizado ni en derecho ni de hecho. ‘"”

It is clear from the text of the provision that the obligation to do what is necessary is
tied to the FET obligation. Itis a corollary to that obligation to ensure that “the exercise
of the right so recognized [i.e., the right to FET] is not impaired either in law or in fact.”
In the Tribunal’s view, this does not provide the Claimant further rights, nor does it
impose any additional obligations on the Respondent, beyond the FET standard. As
the Tribunal has already discussed, there is nothing further for the Tribunal to address
in this respect.

c. Did the Respondent Breach the Umbrella Clauses Imported Through the
MFN Clause?

The Claimant further submits that the BIT’s MFN clause allows it to import the umbrella
clauses contained in Costa Rica’s BITs with Taiwan and Korea, which provide as
follows:

Either Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may have

entered into with regard to investments in its territory by investors of the
other Contracting Party."

[...] Each Contracting Party shall comply with any obligation assumed

regarding investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.
On the basis of these imported clauses, the Claimant argues that the Respondent
breached its obligation, assumed through the grant of the Concession(s), to allow the
Claimant to exploit the Crucitas mine.

The Tribunal cannot follow this argument. For an obligation to be protected under the
umbrella clause, it must be valid under domestic law. ''°5 As discussed above, both the
2002 and the 2008 Concessions were granted in violation of Costa Rican law. There
was thus no valid obligation under domestic law that could be complied with.

The Tribunal thus dismisses the Claimant's claim based on the BIT’s MFN clause.

Does THE ENVIRONMENTAL EXCEPTION IN SECTION III(1) OF ANNEX | OF THE BIT
EXEMPT THE RESPONDENT FROM LIABILITY?

A majority of the Tribunal has found that the Respondent breached its FET obligation
through the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and, as an ancillary act, the 2012 MINAET
Resolution (to the extent that it implemented that Ban), which had the effectof depriving
Industrias Infinito of the opportunity to apply for anew exploitation concession. 1196

While the Tribunal has found that the Claimant has not established that this breach
caused a quantifiable harm, it must address the Respondent's argument that the
environmental exception in Section III(1) of Annex | of the BIT exempts Costa Rica from
liability.

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that, as a result of Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT, it cannot
be held liable for the challenged measures. ‘97 Annex I, Section III(1) provides as
follows:

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Contracting
Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise
consistent with this Agreement that it considers appropriate to ensure that
investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to
environmental concerns.‘

The Respondent argues that Section III(1) provides for an environmental exception
whose purpose is to “grant some margin of discretion, as well as some level of
protection from liability, to the States Parties to enable them to enact, maintain and
enforce measures to protect the environment and thereby advance the public good.”1199

The Respondent explains that the environmental exception applies to measures that (i)
are otherwise consistent with the BIT, and (ii) that the host State “considers appropriate

to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to
environmental concerns.” 120°

Contrary to the Claimant’s contentions, it is not necessary for both the underlying
environmental measures and the measures adopted to enforce or maintain them to be
“otherwise consistent” with the BIT.'2°' If Section III(1) only permitted Costa Rica to
enact measures that are “otherwise consistent’ with the BIT, as the Claimant argues,
the environmental exception could only apply where all the relevant measures are
consistent with the BIT. In other words, it would only apply in situations where the host
State’s liability is not at stake, that is, where “there is no need for any exemption from
liability.” 12°? The Claimant's interpretation would thus establish a mechanism that would
never be triggered, and would be inconsistent with the clause’s substantive purpose.1203

By contrast, the Respondent submits that “the term ‘measure’ refers to the underlying
measure that is safeguarding the environment, rather than to a subsequent measure
that maintains or enforces such underlying measure.” 2° The decision in Al Tamimi,
which involved an environmental clause identical to Section III(1),12°5 confirms its
interpretation. 12° Finally, the Respondent argues that its interpretation of Section III(1)
ensures that the environmental exception is effective and serves its purpose. 1207

The Respondent contends that the clause applies in the present case, with the result
that the Respondent is exempted from liability, '7°° because all of the challenged
measures — with exception of the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision — were
adopted to maintain and/or enforce measures aiming at protecting the environment
from possible negative effects of open-pit mining. '2°°

Further, the underlying measures (namely, the (i) the 2002 Moratorium; (ii) the 2004
Constitutional Chamber Decision; (iii) Resolution R-613-2007-MINAE which rendered
the 2002 Concession null and void; (iv) the annulment of the 2008 Concession by the
2010 TCA Decision; and (v) the 2010 Executive Moratoria) should be deemed to be

consistent with the BIT because the Claimant did not challenge them, and because
they pre-date the cut-off date under the limitations provision in Article XII(3)(c). 21°

The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant denies that Annex |, Section III(1) of the BIT relieves the Respondent
form liability. The Claimant essentially argues that (i) the Respondent is
mischaracterizing Section III(1), which is not an exemption clause; (ii) Costa Rican
authorities and the Supreme Court had confirmed that the Crucitas Project complied
with Costa Rican environmental policy; and (iii) there is no evidence that Costa Rica
adopted the contested measures on environmental grounds. '21'

First, the Claimant submits that Section III(1) is not an “environmental exception” under
which a host State would be exempt of liability if it adopted the challenged measures
to enforce environmentally motivated measures. '2'2 According to the Claimant, Section
IlI(1) is “limited to confirming environmental regulatory authority where that authority
does not override the substantive provisions of the BIT.” 2" Simply put, Section III(1)
merely acknowledges the State’s sovereign right to regulate on environmental matters
and cannot be used to “override the substantive obligations of the BIT and exempt
otherwise infringing measures [...].”12"4

According to the Claimant, this interpretation is confirmed by the literal meaning of
Section III(1), which refers expressly to “any measure otherwise consistent with this
Agreement.” '2'5 For the Claimant, the reference to “any measure” includes the
“underlying” measure that is adopted by a State, as well as any subsequent measure
that maintains or enforces the “underlying” measure. There is thus no basis to
distinguish between the underlying environmental measures and the measures
adopted by the host State to enforce or maintain the former. '2'6 If Costa Rica’s
interpretation were correct, it would “provide aback door for the Government to avoid
its obligations under the BIT by framing any measure in terms of maintaining or
enforcing pre-existing or underlying measures, which could not be challenged owing to
the three-year limitation.” 12"7

The Claimant further contends that the A/ Tamimi case on which the Respondent relies
is irrelevant because the measures at issue in that case did not breach the applicable
BIT. 1218

Second, the Claimant argues that the Respondent is estopped from invoking Section
III(1) since its own authorities - SETENA, SINAC and the Constitutional Chamber of
the Supreme Court — have confirmed that the Crucitas Project was environmentally
viable. '219 Indeed, the Costa Rican Government defended the Crucitas Project's
environmental viability before the Costa Rican courts. '?2° Relying on Metalclad, the
Claimant argues that the Respondent cannot ignore its own Government's conduct,
and that “where the state has demonstrated that it considers the project at issue to be
sensitive to environmental concerns,” provisions such as Section III(1) do not apply. 1221

Third, the Claimant argues that the challenged measures have no environmenta
purpose and thus do not engage Section III(1). 1222 The Claimant stresses that the main
measure it challenges is the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which merely
engaged in a technical analysis of the 2010 TCA Decision in light of Costa Rican
administrative law. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision has thus no “sound
environmental purpose.” '223 Similarly, the 2012 MINAET Resolution and the 2011
Legislative Ban “were not motivated by bona fide environmental concerns.” '2*4 More
precisely, the Claimant argues that (i) the 2012 MINAET Resolution was merely
implementing a judgment rendered on administrative grounds and thus cannot be
characterized as an environmental measure; '225 and (ii) several factors show that the
2011 Legislative Ban was issued for political reasons unrelated to environmenta
concerns. '26 This is confirmed by the fact that Costa Rica has not taken adequate
measures to prevent illegal mining and environmental damage caused by that mining
on the Project site, or to police or remediate that damage. 1227

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Contracting
Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise
consistent with this Agreement that it considers appropriate to ensure that
investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to
environmental concerns. *

According to the general rule of interpretation enshrined in Article 31 of the VCLT, the
Tribunal must interpret the Treaty’s provisions in accordance with their ordinary
meaning, in their context and in light of the treaty’s object and purpose.

The Tribunal notes that, unlike other provisions on environmental protection in other
investment treaties, '729 Annex I, Section III(1) of the Costa Rica-Canada BIT contains
the wording “any measure otherwise consistent with this Agreement.” In the Tribunals
view, this wording makes it clear that measures meant “to ensure that investment
activity [...] is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns” must also
be consistent with the investment protections set forth in the BIT.

Commentators agree that provisions with such wording “cannot[...] be used to override
mandatory treaty obligations,”'75° and that the “requirement that environmenta
measures be ‘otherwise consistent’ with the investment treaty [...] undermines the
effectiveness of that shield.”'231 One commentator opines that the scope of these
provisions is “extremely limited,” and that, despite the fact that most of themare entitled
“general exceptions,” “they do not really do much to narrow States’ potential liability
[...]. Rather, they merely recognize and affirm the State’s sovereign right to regulate
[...].’ 1282 For instance, this author submits that these “general provisions [...] have no
impact whatsoever on the expropriation provision, which does not prohibit a State from
enacting regulations that effectively expropriate investors’ property, but demands
compensation in return.” 1233

The Tribunal notes that both Parties refer to Al Tamimi, an arbitration brought under
the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement. The tribunal in that case considered the treaty's
provisions recognizing the importance of environmental measures as the context for
interpreting the State Parties’ obligations, and noted that the States enjoyed a “margin

of discretion” in relation to the enforcement of their environmental laws. '2°4 There is no
basis to conclude, however, that the tribunal considered that the treaty’s references to
environmental measures suggested there should be greater deference in matters
relating to the environment than the deference due generally to States in relation to
their domestic regulatory affairs.'2°5 Notably, the A/ Tamimi tribunal also observed that
“even an express provision such as Article 10.10 will not protect a State from liability
for measures that are carried out in bad faith, or in violation of the expected standards
of basic fairness or due process.”

Finally, Costa Rica contends that the words “otherwise consistent with this Agreement’
in Annex I, Section III(1) do not apply to the measures that Infinito challenges because
they merely “maintain or enforce” pre-existing measures, and that Infinito is not
challenging and is not permitted to challenge those pre-existing measures because of
the three-year limitation period. 125” It argues that the phrase “otherwise consistent’
refers to the word “measure,” and the context shows that the term “measure” refers to
the underlying measure that is safeguarding the environment, rather than to a
subsequent measure that maintains or enforces such underlying measure. 123°

The Tribunal cannot follow this interpretation. The terms “otherwise consistent with this
Agreement’ also apply to measures that are “maintain[ed]” or “enforc[ed],” not only to
measures that are “adopted.” Consequently, in accordance with its ordinary meaning,
Annex|, Section III(1) does not exempt an environmental measure fromthe substantive
provisions of the BIT, regardless of whether that measure is a new measure that is
“adopted” or whether it is a measure that “maintains” or “enforces” an earlier measure.

The Tribunal concludes that, interpreted in accordance with the VCLT, Annex |, Section
IlI(1) is not a carve-out from the BIT’s protections, but rather a reaffirmation of the
State’s right to regulate.

The Respondent argues however that, unless it is interpreted as exempting the
Respondent from liability for the adoption of environmental measures, Annex|, Section
IlI(1) is deprived of its effet utile. The Tribunal cannot agree. It understands that the
purpose of this provision is to protect the Contracting State’s legitimate regulatory
space and to reserve a margin of discretion in environmental matters. '2°° Provisions
like Annex |, Section III(1) must be viewed as acknowledging and reminding interpreters
that these two objectives — environment and investment protection — should, if possible,

be reconciled so that they are mutually supportive and reinforcing. '24° In other words,
this provision reaffirms the State’s right to regulate.

Al Tamimi supports this interpretation. In that case, the tribunal found that fines issued
by the government for repeated and serious breaches of environmental regulations
were issued in furtherance of its role “to regulate and supervise compliance with
Oman’s environmental laws.”'41 In reaching this conclusion, the tribunal relied on a
provision of the U.S.-Oman FTA with the exact language contained in Annex I, Section
III(1) of the BIT. 1742 Significantly, the measures at issue did not breach the substantive
protections in the relevant treaty.'243 While this provision confirmed Oman’s right to
sanction violations of its environmental laws in a manner that did not otherwise breach
its obligations under the treaty, the Tribunal is not persuaded that it would have
operated as a defense had the tribunal found that those measures breached the treaty.

Conversely, the Respondent's argument that Annex |, Section III(1) of the BIT provides
a defense to substantive breaches of the BIT would render meaningless the “otherwise
consistent with this Agreement” language. Other exceptions and exemptions contained
in Section III are not limited by similar language. For example, Section III(3) contains
an unlimited exemption enabling the Contracting Parties to adopt or maintain
“reasonable measures for prudential reasons’ related to financial market protection and
regulation. Similarly, Section III(4) exempts “investments in cultural industries” from the
provisions of the BIT. Since Section III(1) does contain the “otherwise consistent”
language, it cannot be construed as an exception or exemption fromthe BIT protections
for environmental measures.

The Tribunal concludes that Annex |, Section III(1) of the Costa Rica-Canada BIT does
not exempt the Respondent from liability for breaches of the substantive protections
granted by the BIT. Accordingly, it cannot exempt the Respondent for its breaches of
its FET obligation.

Pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the
parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in
connectionwith the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those
expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the
charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such
decision shall form part of the award.

The Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate the costs of the arbitration between the
Parties, including legal fees and expenses, as it deems appropriate. The Parties have
not disputed the Tribunal’s discretion, and in fact, the Respondent has explicitly
recognized it. 1266

Two approaches have been adopted by ICSID tribunals in awarding costs. The first
consists in apportioning ICSID costs in equal shares and ruling that each party shall
bear its own costs. The second applies the principle “costs follow the event,” such that
the losing party bears the costs of the proceedings, including those of the other party,
or that the parties share in the costs proportionately to their success or failure.

In reaching its decision on costs in this case, the Tribunal has considered the Parties’
arguments as well as the circumstances of this case, including the Parties’ conduct in
pursuing their claims and defenses. The Tribunal observes that the Claimant has
prevailed on jurisdiction and the Respondenthas largely but not entirely succeeded on
the merits. It also notes that the factual and legal issues to which this dispute gave rise
were highly complex and that it can certainly not be deemed illegitimate or frivolous for
the Claimant to have brought this arbitration. Its claims gave rise to difficult questions,
the outcome of which could not easily be predicted at the time of initiating these
proceedings. It must also be observed that both Parties and their counsel have
conducted these proceedings in a professional, cooperative, and efficient manner.

Weighing all these elements, the Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion under Article
61(2) of the ICSID Convention, finds it fair that the Costs of the Proceeding shall be
shared equally between the Parties, '267 and that each Party shall bear its own legal
fees and other costs.

Although I greatly respectand esteem my distinguished colleagues, Icannot concur with
them on several important legal findings, both on jurisdiction and onthe merits. I specify
that I do not disagree with the overall solution given to the case, but it is impossible for
me to subscribe to some of the analyses and reasonings, especially when they involve
public international law interpretation. As stated by Lao-Tseu, “/e but n'est pas
seulement le but, mais le chemin qui y conduit” (“the aim is not only the goal but the
way to it”). In a nutshell, I would have reached the same overall conclusion to the
dispute, but through significantly different avenues. Although it might appear
superfluous, as I agree with the final outcome of the case, I feel important to describe
these avenues.

My main disagreement concerns the existence of jurisdiction ratione temporis: in my
view, according to the statute of limitations included in Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT, the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claims presented by Infinito. Of course, my
comments could thus have stopped at that point since, without jurisdiction, there is no
need to deal with the merits. However, as the majority of the Tribunal decided that it
had jurisdiction and dealt with the merits, I consider it as my Arbitrator’s duty to point
— briefly — to what I analyze as misinterpretations in the application of public
international law to the interpretation of the standard of FET in the BIT between the
Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Costa Rica.

JURISDICTION: APPLICATION OF THE TIME BAR PROVISION IN
ARTICLE XII(3)(C) BIT

The central jurisdictional question,! on which this Opinion will concentrate is whether
the claims of Infinito were time-barred or not.

At the outset, it can be mentioned that there is no disagreement, between the Parties,
that the cut-off date is 6 February 2011, as acknowledged in the Award:

As discussed in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Request for Arbitration
was filed on 6 February 2014. Hence, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over
claims regarding which the Claimant first acquired knowledge of the
breach and loss more than three years earlier, i.e. before 6 February 2011.
The Parties agree with this cut-off date.”

The Claimant invokes five measures— adopted after the cut-offdate— which itconsiders
to be in breach of the BIT, as is summarized in § 224 of the Award:

Another objection was that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae and ratione voluntatis,
because the Claimant’s investment was not owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rica’s laws as
required by Article I(g) of the BIT. I willjust signal here that, although there are somea mbiguities in the
Award on what exactly was the Claimant’s investment, I agree with the approach found in §§ 177 and
178 of the Award: “177. The Respondent has not disputed that the Claimant owns or controls its shares
in Industrias Infinito in accordance with Costa Rican law. Nor has it argued that the Claimant acquired
these shares illegally, or that its ownership or control of these shares has been vitiated in any way [...].
178. There being no dispute that the Claimant has made an indirect investment in Costa Rica (i.e., its
shares in Industrias Infinito) in accordance with its la ws, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s illega lity
objection. [...]”

Award, § 219. (Emphasis in the Award).

The Claimant argues that the breaches of the Treaty occurred through five
measures, which post-date the cut-off date [...]:

a. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision dated 30 November 2011
Le]

b. The 2011 Legislative Mining Ban on open-pit mining, which entered
into force on 10 February 2011 [...]

c. The 2012 MINAET Resolution dated 9 January 2012 [...]

d. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision dated 19 June 2013 [...]

e. The reinitiation of the TCA proceedings for environmental damage in
January 2019.

Its argumentation however is centered on the main breach that has to be taken into
account for the application of the statute of limitations, i.e., the Administrative
Chamber Decision,? dated 30 November 2011, that is after the cut-off date.

The Respondent considers that the measure that allegedly deprived Infinito of its
investment in violation of the BIT is the TCA Decision, which was rendered as an oral
ruling on 24 November 2010, and a written ruling on 14 December 2010,¢ that is before
the cut-off date.

This Opinion will concentrate on the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, as it is,
according to the Claimant, the measure that deprived Industrias Infinito of the 2008
Concession.

In order to go step by step, I will first define precisely the scope of the disagreement
between my colleagues and myself, next consider the general approach based on law
and doctrine relating to the timing of a breach, which, I believe, supports my position,
before engaging in a factual approach dealing with the specific circumstances of this
case, mainly scrutinizing the behavior of both Parties, over the relevant time period.

THE SCOPE OF THE DISAGREEMENT
As a reminder, Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT provides, in relevant part:

An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to
arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if: [...] not more than
three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first
acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach
and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage [...].
(Emphasis added)

I consider that the majority instead applied the following provision, a kind of Article
XII(3)(c) bis:

Supreme Court, Administrative Chamber, Decision (confirming the TCA Decision), 30 November 2011,
C261.

Contentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (cancelling exploitation concession and approvals),
Judgment 4399-2010, 14 December 2010, C-239.

4

An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to
arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if: [...] not more than
three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor finally
acquired, or should have finally acquired, knowledge of the alleged
breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred a complete —
substantial and permanent’ — loss or damage.

To me, it is evident, as I will elaborate on below, that the first knowledge both of a
breach and of a loss occurred with the TCA Decision.

Concerning the time when the breach occurred, I really have a difficulty with the
Award’s approach, which has been summarized in its § 236:

 

Hence, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the first step in the
analysis is to identify when a given act or omission was performed or
completed. The second step is to assess when the Claimant first knew of
the completion of the action or omission and of the loss caused thereby.
This analysis must be conducted for each of the standards allegedly
breached [...]. (Emphasis added)

 

  

I think that to look at the first knowledge of a breach and loss is in conformity with the
rules of interpretation of the VCLT, as Article XII(3)(c) refers to “the date on which the
investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach
and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.” I do not really understand
how first knowledge has been metamorphosed in first knowledge of a completed
breach, which disguises in fact final knowledge, which I do not consider to be in
conformity with the rules of interpretation of the VCLT of the text of Article XII(3)().
The Article refers to the date when an investor first acquired knowledge of a breach and
loss not when the existence of the breach and loss was finally ascertained and known.

In fact, the Award mentions numerous times® that the Administrative Chamber Decision
confirmed the TCA Decision. When an act confirms another act, it means that the
content of the first act has to be considered as existing since the date it was adopted.
In the same vein, the Award refers multiple times’ to a completed act — brought about
by the Administrative Chamber Decision — to circumvent the requirement that the
relevant date is the date of the first act— the TCA Decision. The idea underlying the
majority’s approach must be that something was missing to the TCA Decision and that
it had to be completed, i.e., that an additional element was needed for the act to exist
However, the Administrative Chamber Decision did not itself produce any new
breach of which the Claimant complains. The situation was just that the status quo
remained as it was after the TCA Decision. The simplest proof of this is the fact that,
even if the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision would never have been issued, the
concession rights would still be null and void by virtue of the 2010 TCA Decision. The
only thing that the Administrative Chamber Decision did was to confirm an earlier

This point was insisted upon by the majority in the analysis of expropriation, but seems to have been
implicitly admitted also for the other violations.

Award, §§ 137, 142,224(a),382(a), 416(a), 496, 501, 546 (two times), 565, 580, 708, 710.

breach, or if said differently, to refuse to cure the earlier breach, that earlier breach
being already known to the Claimant.

The Award’s approach, as just summarized, is based on the idea that the TCA Decision
was nota breach, and on the analysis according to which the breach only occurred, as a
final breach, with the Administrative Chamber Decision.

I wonder how this analysis can be reconciled with the principle that a breach of
international law occurs at the moment when the act or acts of the State cease to be in
conformity with the obligations which are alleged to be violated.’ The Award’s
position implies that the TCA Decision annulling the concession was in conformity
with Costa Rica’s international obligations, while suddenly the Administrative
Chamber Decision — which did not modify the status quo — was not in conformity
with Costa Rica’s international obligations.

Concerning the time when the loss that resulted from the breach occurred, looking first
at the claim of expropriation, the majority insisted that the loss has to be permanent and
substantial, and that this only occurred with the Administrative Chamber Decision. The
majority considered that:

[T]he deprivation of the Claimant’s investment only became a permanent
loss with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. Indeed, it is only
with this judgment that the 2010 TCA Decision became final (firme).°

be]
[T]he facts on record about the financial effects of the 2010 TCA Decision
show that the Claimant did not suffer a substantial deprivation of its
investment (a requirement for an indirect expropriation to occur) until the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. '°

However, it is easy to understand that, assuming there would have been no
Administrative Chamber Decision, the result of the TCA Decision was exactly the same:
a permanent and substantial loss. It is well known that the loss was already quite severe,
after the TCA Decision, but it was also known to be virtually substantial and
permanent, it nothing changed. The fact that the complete drop in value only
materialized after the Administrative Chamber Decision is readily understandable, by
the hope of Infinito to see the TCA Decision be set aside. But in the absence of such
reversal, the substantial and permanent loss was already there, inherent in the TCA
Decision.

See Article 12 of the ILC Articles on the International Responsibility of States (CL-007):
Article 12. Existenceofa breach ofan international obligation

There is a breach ofan international obligation by a State whenanact of thatState
is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless ofits
origin or character.

I would also like to deal with the argument that the TCA Decision was suspended during
the cassation proceedings. A suspension does not annul the suspended judgment, which
still exists, it has just as a consequence that it cannot provisionally be enforced.

In other words, I consider that the alleged breach is the TCA Decision. When a court
annuls a concession, it is difficult for me to say that this was not a breach entailing
losses. If no cassation proceedings would have been commenced, the breach would still
be existing. In this case, a cassation proceeding was commenced before the cut-off
date, which is an undeniable recognition that there was a breach (and losses) before
the cut-off date, although the investor wanted to overturn it. The TCA Decision is
alleged to have breached the investor’s rights. As cassation proceedings were
commenced, the breach still existed, until it was either confirmed (which would be a
final knowledge of the breach and not a first knowledge of the breach) or overtumed
(which means that there is no longer a breach and therefore no necessity to apply the
statute of limitations to a useless arbitration, the national courts having solved the
problem).

The breach occurred in 2010, before the cut-off date. The only thing that was not
known is whether this breach would remain as it was or whether the national courts
would remedy the breach.

The TCA Decision is undoubtedly the first step to which the other acts complained of
do not add anything. They only did not cancel this first act. Four of the acts complained
of by the Respondent are linked with the TCA Decision.

If the TCA Decision would not have been the first breach, the other decisions of the
courts and administrative organs would nothave existed. The TCA Decisionis the root
of all the subsequent events: (1) the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision upheld
the 2010 TCA Decision; (2) the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision denied a
separate challenge on constitutional grounds against the 2010 TCA Decision; (3) the
2012 MINAET Resolution enforced the 2010 TCA Decision in its order to cancel
Industrias Infinito’s concession and remove it from the Mining Registry; (4) even the
reopening of the proceedings for environmental damages was linked with the TCA
Decision.

If the 201 1 Administrative Chamber Decision had not been issued, the 2008 Concession,
which was annulled before the cut-off date by the TCA Decision, would have remained
annulled.

Some last general remarks might be in order.

First, it is well known that access to international arbitration does not require — unless it
is specifically foreseen — the exhaustion of local remedies. Article 26 of the ICSID
Convention is quite clear in this respect:

Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless
otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of
any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local
administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to
arbitration under this Convention.

28.

29.

30.

31.

32.

There is no requirement of an exhaustion of local remedies in the BIT. In deciding that
the breach only occurred when the final decision of the Supreme Court was adopted, the
majority reintroduces in the arbitration process a condition of exhaustion of the
local remedies that was not agreed between the Contracting Parties of the BIT.

Second, the majority takes comfort with the solution to which it has arrived at, in stating
the following:

This conclusion is consistent with the raison d’étre of a statute of
limitations, which is to promote legal certainty by avoiding that claimants
delay bringing their claims. This being so, for the statute of limitations to
start running, the claimant must be legally in a position to bring a claim. If
aclaim cannot be brought for legal reasons (for instance, because the claim
is not ripe), it would be fundamentally unfair to find that the statute of
limitations has started to run. Such a finding may entail that, in some
instances, a claimant/investor would have less time to initiate its claim than
the statute of limitations. In exceptional situations, that finding might even
mean that the claimant/investor has no time left at all to start proceedings,
which would effectively result in a denial of justice — an outcome that
cannot reflect the meaning of the Treaty. !!

But, I consider this reasoning entirely circular and again based on the idea thatno breach
occurs before the local remedies have been exhausted, suggesting that before such
exhaustion the claim is not ripe. It can also be mentioned that, in the specific case, the
Claimant had until 5 February 2014 to file a claim, if my analysis is applied, which is a
little more than 26 months after the Decision which the majority considers to be the
breach. In other words, the fear mentioned by the majority that the finding that the first
knowledge of a breach might prevent a claimant to bring a claim, if it waits for the final
knowledge, does not exist in the circumstances of the present case.

THE GENERAL APPROACH

Case Law in Support of the Arbitrator’s Analysis

There are many cases applying a similar analysis, which can be cited here, although, as
often, there are also cases adopting a different point of view. The question of the cutoff
date or critical date can arise in different contexts: the existence ofa statute of limitations
like in the present case, referring expressly to a first knowledge, the existence of a
dispute before a treaty enters into force, the existence of facts pre-dating and facts post-
dating the making of an investment.

In Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic,'2 the tribunal cited with approval a
submission of the United States, as amicus curiae, in the case of Grand River v. USA,

Award, § 247.
The relevant article of DR-CAFTA was similarto the onein the present case:
Article 10.18: Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party

1. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three
years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should
have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and
knowledge that the claimant (forclaims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the

8

33.

34.

relating to a similar statute of limitations, stating that “[w]Jhere a ‘series of similar and
related actions by a respondentstate’ is at issue, an investor cannotevade the limitations
period by basing its claim on ‘the most recent transgression in that series’.” 3 In that
case, there was an act of the State authorities which was the refusal of a license which
occurred before the cut-off date, and a refusal to reconsider this decision which occurred
after the cut-off date. The tribunal clearly indicated that the refusal was the first act and
the fact that it was not overturned did not change the analysis:

In this context, the Respondent’s failure to reconsider the refusal to grant
the license is nothing but an implicit confirmation of its previous
decision. [...]

[...] DR’s failure to respond to the Claimant’s Motion for Reconsideration
was understood by the Claimant itself at that time as not producing any
separate effects on its investment other than those that were already
produced by the initial decision. '4

In the same way, it can be said that, in the present case, the Administrative Chamber
Decision was an explicit confirmation of the previous Decision of the TCA.

In Spence v. Costa Rica,'* the statute of limitations had the exact same wording than in
Article XII(3)(c) of the Canada-Costa Rica BIT, and the tribunal considered that the
relevant date for jurisdictional purposes was the first knowledge of a breach and not the
subsequent confirmation of the breach. It is worth quoting extensive extracts of the
award, as it presents things quite clearly:

162. The Claimants face formidable jurisdictional hurdles. On the face of
it, the conduct of which they complain has deep roots in the period before
the CAFTA entered into force between Costa Rica and the United States
on | January 2009. [...]

163. [...] If the Claimants cannot establish, to an objective standard, that
they first acquired knowledge of the breaches and losses that they allege in
the period after 10 June 2010, they fall at the first hurdle. To surmount this
obstacle, each claimant must show, in respect of each property claim, that
they have a cause of action, a distinct and legally significant event that
is capable of founding a claim in its own right, of which they first
became aware in the period after 10 June 2010. If they can establish this, a
further jurisdictional question arises, namely, whether, in the
circumstances of each claim presented, that post-critical limitation
date cause of action can be sufficiently detached from acts or facts that
pre-date the CAFTA’s entry into force on 1 January 2009 so as to be
independently justiciable, even if it may be appropriate still to have
regard to pre-1 January 2009 conduct and developments for purposes of

enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or
damage. (Emphasis added)

determining whether there was a subsequent breach of a CAFTA
obligation.

be]

210. On the issue of first knowledge of the breach, if a claim is to be
justiciable for purposes of CAFTA Article 10.18.1, the Tribunal considers
that it must rest on a breach that gives rise toa self-standing cause of action
in respect of which the claimant first acquired knowledge within the
limitation period.

Le]

213. On the issue of whether loss or damage must be crystallised, and
whether the claimant must have a concrete appreciation of the quantum of
that loss or damage, the Tribunal agrees with the approach adopted in
Mondev, Grand River, Clayton and Corona Materials that the limitation
clause does not require full or precise knowledge of the loss or damage.
Indeed, in the Tribunal’s view, the Article 10.18.1 requirement, inter alia,
to point to the date on which the claimant first acquired actual or
constructive knowledge of the loss or damage incurred in consequence of
the breach implies that such knowledge is triggered by the first
appreciation that loss or damage will be (or has been) incurred. It
neither requires nor permits a claimant to wait and see the full extent of the
loss or damage that will or may result. It is the first appreciation of loss or
damage in consequence ofa breach that starts the limitation clock ticking.'°
(Emphasis in bold added, in italics in the original)

Another award is worth mentioning, as it deals with the existence of a loss due to a
breach, just discussed in the last paragraph of the citation in Spence. In Rusoro v.
Venezuela, the tribunal found that Rusoro’s claim based on measures adopted in 2009
was barred under the relevant statute of limitations, because the claimant had admitted
knowledge of its loss more than three years before bringing the arbitration. In
circumstances similar to those here, the tribunal concluded that “what is required is
simple knowledge that loss or damage has been caused, even if the extent and
quantification are still unclear.” !7

Also, in Vieira v. Chile, '8 the tribunal found that the dispute predated the relevant treaty
because all of the claims derived from the State’s denial of a fishing license application
before the treaty entered into force. This solution was adopted despite the claimant’s

ilicito que da lugar a una nueva controversia, situacién que este tribunal
estima contraria a la intencion de las partes pactada en el articulo 2 del
ACUERDO.

[...] To find the opposite would mean to allow a claimant generally to
elude ratione temporis restrictions established in any Agreement on
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments [by] submitting
anew claim after the relevant treaty’ s entry into force in order to later argue
that the denial of such claim constitutes a violation that gives rise to a new
dispute, a situation which this tribunal considers would be contrary to the
intention of the parties agreed in Article 2 of the Agreement.

Also, in ST-AD v. Bulgaria, some acts of the respondent occurred before the investor
made its investment and some after. An attempt by a claimant to acquire jurisdiction by
resubmitting an application that had been denied before it became an investor was
rejected by the tribunal:

In fact, that is the only possible relevant event that happened after the
critical date of May 25, 2006, when the Claimant became a protected
investor under the BIT, i.e., the second set aside application and its
rejection by the Supreme Cassation Court [...

 

And the tribunal added, in order to make things perfectly clear:

[A] tactic based on the resubmission of an application that has been denied
before a claimant becomes an investor after it has acquired such status is
unacceptable. It creates an illusion of an event that happened when a
protected investor was on the scene. But like all illusions, it is a misleading
illusion.?!

Finally, in EuroGas v. Slovak Republic,” the same reasoning as the one presented in
this Separate Opinion was presented:

455. This chart illustrates the fact that the situation was exactly the same
on 3 May 2005, before the BIT entered into force, and 1 August 2012, after
the BIT entered into force: the mining rights that were lost by Rozmin were

reassigned to another company. In other words, the mining rights were
taken from Rozmin in 2005, allegedly in violation of Belmont’s rights
under the Canada-Slovakia BIT and international law, and several
decisions of the mining authorities (not the judicial authorities) refused to
restitute the rights to Rozmin. The decision of the DMO, on 30 March
2012, to reassign exclusive rights over the Mining Area to VSK Mining,
and its confirmation by the MMO on | August 2012, did not change
Belmont’s legal and factual situation: since the reassignment of the
Mining Area in 2005, it had lost its rights on the Mining Area and was not
present on the site.

 

456. Contrary to Belmont’s position, the decisions of 30 March 2012 and
1 August 2012 cannot be considered the source of a new dispute; rather,
they were a refusal to resolve the ongoing dispute, which arose from the
alleged breach in 2005.

Le]

459. The State Parties to the Canada-Slovakia BIT cannot have intended
that Article 15(6) be read and applied in a way that exposes them to claims
from investors that could date from more than three years before the entry
into force of the treaty, just because a certain dispute was not settled and/or
might give rise to a follow-up action. Considering that the State’s refusal
to overturn an existing alleged breach gives rise to a new dispute would
open the floodgates to a possible complete disregard of the condition
ratione temporis of the application of a BIT. The consequence would be
that an investor could bypass the ratione temporis limitations of a treaty by
commencing local court proceedings after the entry into force of the treaty,
in respect of an old dispute. This cannot be a sensible legal result.

460. The Tribunal does not accept that an investor may invoke the last
event in a series of related or similar actions by the State to claim the
benefit of the treaty. In the present case, the situation is clear-cut since there
has not been a series of (alleged) transgressions by the Respondent, but one
(alleged) transgression whose effects have been maintained
throughout domestic court proceedings and repeated decisions by the
mining authorities. (Emphasis added)

It can also be mentioned here the case Sistem Miihendislik Insaat v. Kyrgyz Republic,3
where the tribunal did hold that, “asa matter of law,” the judicial taking of the claimant’s
hotel took place at the date of a lower court judgment invalidating the underlying
contract. What remained was a “chance of restoration” of the taken right, later
extinguished by the highest appellate instance. (Emphasis added)

This analysis is not only to be found in investment law as applied by international
arbitral tribunals, but is an approach more generally accepted in legal systems.

An example can be given here. The Permanent Court of International Justice has
considered that, when faced with an act and a refusal to overturn the act, the relevant
element for analysing jurisdiction is the initial act. In the Phosphates in Morocco case,
it considered that, as here, the alleged breach of the Italian investor’ srights by the French

authorities refusing to overturn a former decision fell outside the Court’s jurisdiction.24
Like Infinito in the present case, Italy argued that the “violation only became definitive”
when the investor sought and was refused redress by the French Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. The PCIJ denied Italy’s claim on the ground that the subsequent refusal to
redress the prior wrong

merely results in allowing the [allegedly] unlawful act to subsist. It
exercises no influence either on the accomplishment of the act or on
the responsibility ensuing from it. (Emphasis added)

The Court held that the claim concerning the alleged breach was precluded ratione
temporis.

Doctrine in Support of the Arbitrator’s Analysis

The International Law Commission, ILC, is a well-regarded actor of international law.
Professor James Crawford, Special Rapporteur, ILC, discussed the situation in which
there is an exhaustion of local remedies. He made it clear that two situations can occur:
either the last decision is by itself a violation (for example a denial of justice), or it only
confirms the initial wrongful act. In that later case, absent an additional internationally
wrongful act by the local courts providing the local remedy against the breach, “the
local remedy is a failed cure, not part of the illness [...].”25 (Emphasis added)

Professor Crawford added that:

[T]he breach of international law occurs at the time when the treatment
occurs. The breach is not postponed toa later date when local remedies
are exhausted [...].2° (Emphasis added)

Others have adopted the same position, among them the Swiss academic, Eric Wyler.?7

The general approach relating to the timing of a breach having been clarified, I will now
examine carefully how the behavior of the Parties in the circumstances of the case
should be analyzed within this framework.

THE FACTUAL APPROACH

To understand the facts and circumstances of this case, the positions of the Parties in the
arbitration, but may be more importantly, the positions of the Parties at the time of the
disputed events, have to be scrutinized.

In a nutshell, the Respondent argues that the cancelation of the 2008 Concession was
enacted by the TCA Decision adopted before the cut-off date, a circumstance which
deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over Infinito’s claims; while the Claimant contends
that the annulment was enacted by the Administrative Chamber Decision, after the cut-
off date, giving thus jurisdiction to this Tribunal to deal with its claims.

It is my view that the Claimant assigned a role for the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision, for the purpose of this arbitration, in order to be able to assert jurisdiction. I
find that such a reconstruction of what happened does not fit with the facts of the case,
especially with the behavior of the Parties as both the Claimant and the State authorities
always considered at the time of the events — before the launch of the arbitration — that
the breach was caused by the TCA Decision.

I will now give some concrete elements to support this last statement, which I consider
quite important.

The Summary of the Positions of the Parties in the Tribunal’s Decision on
Jurisdiction

In fact, the mere reading of the summaries of the positions of the Parties, as presented
in the Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction shows that the Respondent relies — rightly —
on the first knowledge, while the Claimant relies — wrongly — on the final knowledge.

The Respondent’s position as summarized in the Decision on Jurisdiction is the
following:

The Respondent points out that, under Article XII(3)(c), an investor ‘first’
acquires knowledge of an alleged breach and loss at a particular ‘date.’ For
the Respondent, ‘[s]uch knowledge cannot ‘first’ be acquired at multiple
points in time or ona recurring basis.” Here, the Claimant first acquired
knowledge of its alleged loss or damage with the issuance of the 2010
TCA Decision in December 2010, and acknowledged this publicly in a
press release dated 18 January 2011, both before the cut-off date. In that
press release, the Claimant stated that it was seeking to reestablish the
value of its investments and to reverse the negative impact of the 2010
TCA Decision on the company’s share price. While the cassation
proceedings could have provided hope that the Administrative Chamber
would reverse the Claimant’s loss, the fact that the 2010 TCA Decision
was not reversed cannot be equated to a new loss. Moreover, Infinito
was not certain that it would be able to reverse the 2010 TCA Decision,
and the fact that it acknowledged that it needed to ‘restor{e] the Company’s
rights or value’ underscores that it believed that it had already suffered a
loss.?8 (Emphasis added).

 

 

The Claimant’s position as summarized in the Decision on Jurisdiction is the following

316. As discussed in Section IV.C.3.a(ii) supra, the Claimant emphasizes
that the 2010 TCA Decision ‘is not the measure that Infinito is challenging
because it did not result in the final or irreversible annulment of
Industrias Infinito’s exploitation concession or other project approvals.’

 

Decision on Jurisdiction, § 304, footnotes omitted.

14

55.

56.

57.

58.

According to the Claimant, the annulment of Industrias Infinito’s
exploitation concession and other rights only became final and could only
be acted upon when the Administrative Chamber refused to reverse the
2010 TCA Decision on 30 November 2011. (Emphasis on ‘not’ in the
Claimant’ s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, and for the rest, emphasis added) °

It appears clearly that the positions of the two Parties are not contradictory: the
Respondent argues that the Claimant had first knowledge ofa violation and a loss with
the TCA Decision of November 2010, before the cut-off date; the Claimant does not
contest this (and has indicated as much in contemporaneous documents, as will be
shown later); the Claimant argues however that it had final knowledge of a breach and
a loss only with the refusal by the Administrative Chamber Decision dated 30 November
2011, after the cut-offdate, to reverse the initial breach and loss existing already in 2010.

At All Relevant Times Before the Arbitration, the Claimant Considered that the
Breach was Committed by the TCA Decision of 2010

a. Just After the TCA Decision

Five days after the oral ruling of the TCA, the management of Infinito acknowledged
that it was a negative decision:

On November 24, 2010 the Tribunal rendered a summary ruling on the
challenges raised by a number of citizens [...] The verbal ruling read in
court was negative and included cancellation of the Company's
exploitation concessions, cancellation of the environmental and other
approvals held by the Company's local subsidiary, Industrias Infinito SA.
(‘IISA’). [...] (Emphasis added)

This is a recognition, in an internal document, even before the written ruling, that the
TCA had cancelled all of Infinito’s rights. *°

Soon after Infinito received the written ruling of the TCA, the same analysis was made
public, at the beginning of 2011. The Claimant itself acknowledged, in no doubtful
terms, that it had suffered a breach of its rights and a loss brought about by the TCA
Decision in a press-release dated 18 January 2011, that is before the cut-off date, which
is a quite clear and crucial document:

The filing of the Casacién seeks to overturn the Ruling which annulled
the Exploitation Concession of the Company’s Crucitas gold project.

Le]

The Company is seeking to re-establish the security and value of its
considerable and long term investments in Costa Rica and to reverse the

Decision on Jurisdiction, § 316. This has been the leitmotiv of Claimant’s position. See for exampk, a
citation ofits Reply, § 472: “There is [...] overwhelming fact evidence that Infinito first knew, and only
could have known, thatthe resolutions granting IISA’s key approvals had been finally and irreversibly
annulled, and that Infinito’s investmentin the Crucitas project had been rendered substantially worthless,
on November 30,2011.” (Emphasis added)

negative impact that the Ruling has had with respect to the Company’s
share price and the inherent negative impact on its investors and
employees. *! (Emphasis added)

In this press release, the Claimant acknowledges the annulment of the Concession,
which it considered as a breach, as it wanted to try to overturn it through a cassation
proceeding. It also wanted to erase the loss, as the cassation procedure was launched to
restore the value of its investment. When an investor starts a proceeding in order to
overturn a decision, it is on the assumption that such decision is illegal, thus a breach of
the law having resulted in a loss for the investor.

At that point in time, the breach could be analyzed both as a breach of Costa Rican law
and a breach of the Treaty. An alleged expropriation indeed falls squarely among the
breaches of the BIT. Nothing prevented the investor just after the TCA Decision to go
to ICSID immediately. Infinito rather chose to go to the national courts. I would also
like to mention that the existence of a breach is an objective fact, contrary to the
existence of a dispute which implies subjective elements to be ascertained.

The press release also said that among the future unknown factors is “whether the
negative impacts of the Ruling on the Company can be reversed by the Casacion
[...]” recognizing thus clearly that it had a first knowledge at the time of the TCA
Decision of damage to its investment.

This press release shows undoubtedly knowledge by the Claimant, and even a public
recognition of breach and damage on its date, 18 January 2011, which is before the
cut-off date, while of course also indicating a hope to be able to modify the situation.

I consider it also an important element in the interpretation of the facts of the case that
Infinito started a cassation proceeding before the cut-off date, which means that it
clearly considered that there was a breach, at that point in time. Moreover, ina
Memorandum dated 17 February 2011 — and this is quite important — Infinito indicated
that, while the proceeding before the Administrative Chamber was unfolding, it could
at any time go to international arbitration:

The Company can elect to halt the appeal process and move to international
arbitration at any point in time during the process. *?

When an investor considers resorting to international arbitration, it is because it
considers that it has suffered a breach of its rights by the State, and suffered damages.
In other words, on 17 February 2011, before the Administrative Chamber Decision,
Infinito considered that it had suffered a breach, which could be the basis of an
international claim.

Decision are numerous. I just give here another example, which isa Reporton an update

The Claimant still refers to the TCA Decision as the breach, after the Administrative
Chamber Decision. In a press release dated the day of the Administrative Chamber

On November 24, 2010 the Tribunal Contencioso Adminastrativo [sic] (the
‘Tribunal’) rendered a summary ruling (the ‘Ruling’) on the challenges
raised by a number of citizens against the relevant government agencies
alleging that certain official approvals and permits received by the
Company's wholly owned subsidiary in Costa Rica, Industrias Infinito SA.
(‘IISA’), pertaining to the Crucitas gold mining project, were not issued in
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

The Ruling annulled the Exploitation Concession of the Company's
Crucitas gold project. In addition, the Ruling invalidated the original
approval of the environmental impact study received in December of 2005
during the Abel Pacheco presidency, the amended environmental impact
study received in February of 2008, and the Presidential Decree declaring
the project to be in the national interest received in October of 2008. The
Ruling also states that the Company may be liable to restore certain areas
at the Crucitas mine site to their original pre-tree-clearing condition.

Just After the Administrative Chamber Decision

Claimant itself, the annulment of the concession, which is the act complained of, i.e.,

Chamber of the Supreme Court of Costa Rica (‘SALA I’) has rendered its
decision and rejected the request for annulment (‘Casaci6n’) of the

At All Times — Before and During the Arbitration — the Costa Rican Authorities
Considered that the Alleged Breach was Committed by the TCA Decision of 2010

All the final steps of the proceedings against Infinito were based on the TCA Decision,
not on the Administrative Chamber Decision.

For example, the 2012 MINAET Resolution, Cancellation of the Concession, *5 indicates
the following:

CONSIDERING THAT

1) Oral Judicial Decision No. 4399-2010 issued at 4:00 p.m. on December
14, 2010, by the Contentious Administrative Tribunal, section IV,
determined, among other matters, to ‘[...] set aside resolutions number

MINAET [...].’ ‘[...] The National Mining Registry is ordered to cancel
the concession for Industrias Infinito S.A. which was processed as mining
file N° 2594[...]’.

2) The Judicial Decision of the Contentious Administrative Tribunal cited
above was confirmed by the First Chamber of the Supreme Court of
Justice, and as a result became final.

Le]
WHEREAS,

ONE: In due compliance with the sentence as required under Articles 156
section 1 and 158 of the Contentious Administrative Procedural Code, we
hereby declare the cancellation of the mining exploitation concession
granted to the company Industrias Infinito S.A., which was rendered null
and void by decision N° 4399-2010 issued at 4:00 p.m. on December 14,
2010, by the Contentious Administrative Tribunal, section IV.

THEREFORE

By virtue of the foregoing, in due compliance with the decision in
accordance with Articles 156 section 1 and 158 of the Contentious
Administrative Procedural Code, we hereby declare the cancellation of the
mining exploitation concession granted to the company Industrias Infinito
S.A., granted by Executive Branch resolution No. R-217-2008-MINAE at
3:00 p.m. on April 21, 2008, which was rendered null and void by
decision No. 4399-2010 issued at 4:00 p.m. on the December 14, 2010,
by the Contentious Administrative Tribunal, section IV. Administrative
file 2594 is archived, the area is liberated from the Mining Registry.
(Emphasis added)

In other words, the Costa Rican authorities themselves considered that the annulment of
the concession was NOT performed by the Administrative Chamber Decision butby the
TCA Decision, which has notbeen overturned. The Administrative Chamber’s Decision
is a failed attempt by Infinito to correct a breach that had already occurred.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, I am totally convinced thatall the “measures” challenged by the Claimant
are nothing more than decisions not to reverse the 2010 TCA Decision and/or measures
of implementation of the TCA Decision or other pre-existing measures.

The fact that the 2010 TCA Decision was not reversed by the Administrative Chamber
Decision cannot be equated to a new breach or a new loss. It just meant that the first
breach and loss which occurred before the cut-off date, were not cured. All of the other
challenged measures are deeply rooted in the 2010 TCA Decision, and none of them
were distinct and legally significant events. It must be reiterated that, had the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision not been issued, the Claimant’s Concession would
have remained annulled.

I would therefore have concluded that jurisdiction was lacking.

MERITS: THE SCOPE OF THE FET STANDARD IN ARTICLE II(2)(A) OF
THE BIT

As mentioned at the outset of this opinion, I will — although quite briefly — discuss the
interpretation of the standard of FET made by the majority as a standard disconnected
from the principles of international law. I do not consider this analysis to be in
accordance with the structure of public international law, as I will explain. This
misunderstanding has the double consequence that the majority of the Tribunal
considered, firstly that the FET standard is an autonomous standard different from the
Minimum Standard of Treatment of customary international law and secondly, that
when applied to a review of courts’ decisions, a finding of a violation of the autonomous
FET is less demanding than denial of justice.

Is THE FET STANDARD IN THE RELEVANT BIT AN AUTONOMOUS STANDARD OR Is IT
EQUIVALENT TO MST?

The question raised by the Parties is a divergence concerning the scope of the FET
standard of protection of foreign investors. As summarized in § 328 of the Award, “[t]he
Claimantargues thatthis provision provides for an autonomous FET standard, while the
Respondent considers that it is limited to the MST under international law.”

As always, the starting point for the interpretation of the standards of protection is the
text of the BIT. Article II(2)(a) of the BIT provides that:

Each Contracting Party shall accord investments of the other Contracting
Party: (a) fair and equitable treatment in accordance with principles of
international law; [...] (Emphasis added)

My first remark is that the members of the majority add a word to Article II(2)(a) when
they concentrate their analysis on “general principles” of international law, while the
text refers to “principles” of international law.

I consider that a rigorous legal approach has to be based on the exact expression to be
analyzed. In thatsense, a distinction has to be made between “principles of international

law” (principes du droit international), “general principles of law” (principes généraux

19

79.

80.

81.

82.

de droit) and “general principles of international law” (principes généraux du droit
international).

Principles of international law can easily be understood as merely a reference to
general international law. This has in fact been stated by the PCIJ in the famous Lotus
case*6 in no dubious terms:

[T]he Court considers that the words ‘principles of international law’, as
ordinarily used, can only mean international law as it is applied between
all nations belonging to the community of States.

be]
In these circumstances it is impossible — except in pursuance of a definite
stipulation — to construe the expression ‘principles of international law’
otherwise than as meaning the principles which are in force between all
independent nations [...].°7

 

This interpretation is even more compelling here, as the BIT asks the Tribunal also to
take into account in its analyses the “rules” of international law, as indicated in Article
XII (7) entitled “Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Contracting
Party” referring to the applicable law:

 

A tribunal established under this Article shall decide the issues in dispute
in accordance with this Agreement, the applicable rules of international
law, and with the domestic law of the host State to the extent that the
domestic law is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement or
the principles of international law.

I consider that the double reference to “the applicable rules of international law” and to
“the principles of international law”, without elaborating more on this topic, especially
on the content of the MST, is sufficient to conclude that the FET must be interpreted
according to international law as applied among all nations, which is customary
international law. Therefore, the FET standard is limited by the BIT to the Minimum
Standard of Treatment under customary international law.

This is supported by Canada, in its intervention as a Non—Disputing Party, as mentioned
in the Award, § 322, which stated that:

Canada contends that the phrase ‘in accordance with principles of
international law’ is a reference to the MST. Pursuant to the principle of
effet utile, this phrase must be given meaning. This interpretation is

 

The Case of the S.S. “Lotus”, Judgment, 7 September 1927, Serie A, No. 10. The Court wasinterpreting
the following provision: “Subject to the provisions of Article 16, all questions of jurisdiction shall, as
between Turkey and the other contracting Powers, be decided in accordance with the principles of
international law.” /d.,p. 16 (Emphasis added)

Id.,pp. 16-17. French version : “Or, la Cour estime que le sens des mots ‘principes du droit international
ne peut, selon leur usage général, signifier autre chose que le droit international tel qu'il est en vigueur
entre toutes les nations faisant partie de la communauté internationale. [...] Dans ces conditions, iln’est
pas possible — sauf en vertu d’un texte précis — d’interpréter le terme ‘principes du droit international
autrement quecommesignifiant les principes en vigueur entre toutes les nations indépendantes [...].”

confirmed by the Notes of Interpretation issued under some of Canada’s
treaties, such as the one under the NAFTA.*8 (Emphasis added)

And the meaning given to the reference of “principles of international law” by Canada
in § 20 of its Non-Disputing Party Submission is the following:

The wording in Article II(2)(a) guarantees FET in accordance with the
minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.

This conclusion is rejected by the majority. And in fact, the majority’s analysis arrives
ata conclusion that does not give any meaning, any effet utile to the reference in the
BIT to the principles of international law, which are completely ignored. In other
words, international law has been eliminated, although it is mentioned in the BIT. The
result would have been exactly the same, in the absence of the expression “in accordance
with principles of international law.” Moreover, even having based its analysis on the
general principles of international law, the majority has not endeavored to give any
content to these general principles that could be used for the interpretation of the FET
standard.

In fact, I was at pains to understand how the conclusion of the majority was arrived at,
but I think it is important to clarify, at the outset, the necessary distinctions to be made,
which have been ignored by the majority. I refer to the Dictionnaire de droit
international public,>9 which clearly distinguishes the three concepts earlier mentioned.

First, “Principles of international law” (p. 877):
E. Dans l’expression ‘principes du droit international’ ensemble de
propositions fondamentales du droit international.
L’expression peut alors signifier
(a) ou bien l’ensemble du droit international dans ses bases essentielles

(b) [...] ou bien Iensemble des principes gouvernant un type de relations:
ainsi les ‘principes du droit international touchant les relations amicales’.

(c) [...]ou bien encore les principes gouvernant un domaine particulier du
droit international:

Exemples:

[...] les principes du contentieux international.

E. [...] the expression ‘principles of international law’ the body of
fundamental propositions of international law.

The expression can thus mean

(a) either international law as a whole in its essential bases

This is in line with the uncontested interpretation in the same way of Article 1105 of NAFTA, which
provides that “[e]Jach Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in

(b) [...] or all of the principles governing a type of relationship: thus the
‘principles of international law concerning the friendly relations’.

(c) [...] or even the principles governing a particular area of international
law:

Examples:

[...] the principles of international litigation.
Point a) refers in fact to the position of the PCIJ on the principles of international law in
the Lotus case. Another example to illustrate b) or c) could of course be the international

principles relating to the protection of foreign investment, among which the MST and
denial of justice.

Second, “General principles of law” (p. 879):
Source autonome du droit international aux termes de l'article 38 § 1 du
Statut de la Cour internationale de Justice.
Le]
Selon une doctrine majoritaire ces principes généraux de droit sont des

principes communs aux ordres juridiques internes [...] et transposables a
Vordre international.

Autonomous source of international law under Article 38 § 1 of the Statute
of the International Court of Justice.

Le]

According to a majority of scholars, these general principles of law are
principles common to internal legal orders [...] and transposable to the
international order.

In the Droit international public of Dailler, Forteau and Pellet, *° some of these general
principles of law are mentioned: good faith, principle of effet utile, principle of full
reparation of damages, equality of the parties and so on.

Third, “General principles of international law” (p. 880):

Principe général du droit international

Formulation globalisatrice des principales régles du droit international
issues du droit coutumier ou du droit conventionnel. (Emphasis added)

General principle of international law
Globalizing formulation of the main rules of international law which stem
from customary or conventional law. (Emphasis added)

Some examples are given under this rubric: the prohibition of the use of force or the
principle of non-intervention, to which can be added, among others, the principle ofself-
determination.

Some examples are also given by Patrick Dumberry, cited by the majority, in an article
entitled “The Emergence of the Concept of ‘General Principle of International Law”’,*!
in which he studies the concepts of burden of proof, estoppel, res judicata and abuse of
rights. Interestingly, he also remarks that:

Most tribunals seem to have a poor understanding of both the meaning and
the function of general principles under intemational law. Awards often do
not explain where the general principles they mention are emerging from
(i.e. from which legal order: domestic or international?). Tribunals also
rarely explain why they are referring to a given principle and which
function or role it actually plays in their reasoning. 4?

This is a warning to all arbitrators.

    

Let us now look atthe starting premise of the majority’s analysis, in § 332 of the Award:

Starting first with the ordinary meaning of the terms, there is nothing in the
text of the BIT that limits the FET standard to customary international law.
[...] the expression ‘principles of international law’ cannot be regarded as
a reference to customary international law which is but one source of
international law and is distinct from general principles. *?

This paragraph is quite problematic: the two concepts of principles of international law
and general principles are used in the same sentence and seem to be considered
equivalent. But more importantly, contrary to what the majority claims here, it is quite
clear, as explained by the PCIJ in the Lotus case, that a mention of “principles of
international law” is indeed a reference to customary international law.

I conclude that the majority has erred in basing its analysis on the general principles of
international law and not on the principles of international law.*+

Having eliminated the reference to principles of international law, the majority
concludes that the FET is an autonomous standard, whose scope is not defined in
customary international law, allowing therefore the arbitral Tribunal to decide freely
what are the sources of international law and what are the contours of concepts like FET
or denial of justice, without any constraint coming from principles of international law,

Patrick Dumberry, “The Emergence of the Concept of ‘General Principle of International Law’ in
Investment Arbitration Case Law,” Journal of International Dispute Settlement, 2020, 11, pp. 194-216.

Patrick Dumberry, “The Emergence of the Concept of ‘General Principle of International Law’ in
Investment Arbitration Case Law,” Journal of International Dispute Settlement, 2020, 11,p. 196.

Award, § 332.

Subsidiarily, I also disagree with the extensiveanalysis performed by the majority concerning the source
of the general principles of intemational law, even if, as explained earlier, the latter is irrelevant and
should not have been referred to at all. However, this is more an academic theoretical debate, where
different analyses of the source of the general principles of intemational law can be made, rooted in
different understandings of the structure of international law and I don’t think it is necessary to enter here
into this debate. I will simply point out that, in fact, whatthe majority ignores in its analysis is that both
the principles of international law and the general principles of international law are closely linked with
custom, the principles of intemnational la w being equivalent to customary international la w and the general
principles of international la w deriving — directly or indirectly— from customary international law.

as required by the BIT, nor indeed from the general principles of international law
referred to erroneously by the majority.

I think that arbitrators have a mission to fulfil in the framework of the provision giving
them jurisdiction. When they are required to interpret concepts in accordance with
principles of international law, their power is limited by the content of these principles,
i.e., by customary international law.

Is THE FET STANDARD WHEN APPLIED TO COURTS’ DECISIONS LESS DEMANDING
THAN DENIAL OF JUSTICE?

What I consider the same misunderstanding of the structure of public international law
is at the root of my strong disagreement with the analysis of the role of denial of justice.
More precisely, the majority stated the following:*

Costa Rica and Canada essentially argue that, absent a denial of justice,
judicial decisions interpreting domestic law cannot breach international
law, and that ‘claims of arbitrariness or unfairness in the context of judicial
decisions must be viewed through the lens of denial of justice.” The
Tribunal agrees that this is the case under customary international
law. The question before the Tribunal is, however, whether judicial
measures breach the BIT’s FET standard, which the Tribunal has held not
to be limited to the MST under customary international law. (Emphasis
added)

It is because the majority has considered that the principles of international law do not
refer to customary international law, that it also rejected the well accepted concept of
denial of justice in customary international law and therefore concluded that “judicial
decisions that are arbitrary, unfair or contradict an investor’s legitimate expectations
may also breach the FET standard even if they do not rise to the level of a denial of
justice,” 4° going as far as to state that a court can violate international law even if it
“applies domestic law correctly.”47

I understand that the majority agrees that if the FET were equivalent to the MST, denial
of justice would be the only standard of review of national courts decisions.

The majority, however, considered that, as it analyzed the FET is an autonomous
standard, the review of national courts’ decisions by an international tribunal can go
significantly beyond the denial of justice. This question is hotly debated.

As a first mention in this debate, it can be said that it is common ground that the
interdiction of denial of justice is part of FET, even when considered as an autonomous
standard. This was clearly articulated in many investment awards, for example in Jan
de Nul v. Egypt:

The Tribunal recognizes that the 2002 and 1977 BITs do not comprise a
specific provision regarding the miscarriage or denial of justice. It

considers, however, that the fair and equitable treatment standard
encompasses the notion of denial of justice.*’ (Emphasis added)

It is also not contested that a finding of denial of justice is a very demanding one. This
has been articulated for example in Oostergetel v. Slovak Republic:

The Tribunal notes that a claim for denial of justice under
international law is a demanding one. To meet the applicable test, it will
not be enough to claim that municipal law has been breached, that the
decision of a national court is erroneous, that a judicial procedure was
incompetently conducted, or that the actions of the judge in question were
probably motivated by corruption. A denial of justice implies the failure of
a national system as a whole to satisfy minimum standards. 4? (Emphasis
added)

The same position was also adopted in Philip Morris v. Uruguay:>°

The fair and equitable treatment obligation may be breached if the host
State’s judicial system subjects an investor to denial of justice. The Parties
appear to be broadly in agreement on the legal standard for a denial of
justice. Both cite Arif v. Moldova, its basic proposition being that a denial
of justice is found ‘if and when the judiciary breached the standard by
fundamentally unfair proceedings and outrageously wrong, final and
binding decisions.’

An elevated standard of proof is required for finding a denial of justice
due to the gravity of a charge which condemns the State’s judicial
system as such. A denial of justice claim may be asserted only after all
available means offered by the State’s judiciary to redress the denial of
justice have been exhausted. As held by one decision, ‘[a] denial of justice
implies the failure of a national system as a whole to satisfy minimum
standards.’ (Emphasis added)

Whatis debated is whethera lesser standard of FET is also applicable when international
tribunals review the judgments of national courts.

The problem I see with the majority’s position is that it can authorize an international
tribunal to review fully a national court decision and therefore to act, in fact, as a court
of appeal, which is unanimously considered as beyond its powers, as even recognized
by this Tribunal, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, where it is stated that “‘it is not its role
to act as a court of appeal with respect to decisions of domestic courts.”5!

This is common ground, as can be illustrated by many awards, of which I give just one
example, the Helnan v. Egypt case, where the tribunal stated:

An ICSID Tribunal will not act as an instance to review matters of
domestic law in the manner of a court of higher instance. Instead, the
Tribunal will accept the findings of local courts as long as no deficiencies,
in procedure or substance, are shown in regard to the local proceedings
which are of a nature of rendering these deficiencies unacceptable from the
viewpoint of international law, such as in the case of a denial of justice.5?
(Emphasis added)

Last but not the least, if any violation by a court of an FET standard less demanding
than a denial of justice were admitted, the denial of justice would become useless and
the concept of denial of justice would no longer have any effet utile. Even more
concerning, as already mentioned, a review of courts’ decisions by an international
arbitral tribunal, with the same standard of FET as the one used for a review of
legislative or administrative decisions, opens the door to international arbitral tribunals
playing the role of courts of appeal, which is unanimously considered as not entering
into their function.

In conclusion on the merits, absent the objection ratione temporis which led me to infer
a lack of jurisdiction of this Tribunal over the Claimant’s claims, I would have
interpreted the FET in the BIT as meaning MST°3 and accordingly would have only
covered the analysis in the Award of denial of justice, with which I agree.

2008, §§ 105-106, 125, RL-010: “an international tribunal must accept the res judicata effect ofa decision

Others v. Grenada, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Award, 10 December 2010, §. 7.1.11: “[...] BIT tribunals
do not reopen the municipal la w decisions of competent fora, absent a denial of justice.”

This means that! would not have developed Award, § § 356-367.

Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement between
the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Costa Rica for the
Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed 18 March 1998, entered into force
on 29 September 1999 (the “BIT” or “Treaty”) and the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered
into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention’).

The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.”

This dispute arises out of the development of a gold mining project in the area of Las
Crucitas, in Costa Rica (the “Las Crucitas Project’).

The present decision concerns the Respondent's preliminary objections.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

REGISTRATION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL.

On 6 February 2014, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated also 6 February
2014 from the Claimant against Costa Rica, together with exhibits C-001 to C-008
(the “Request for Arbitration”).

On 4 March 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for
Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the
Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited
the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in
accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of
Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the “Institution Rules”).

In accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Parties agreed to
constitute the Tribunal as follows: three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party
and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.

The Tribunal is composed of Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland,
President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Bernard Hanotiau, a national of
Belgium, appointed by the Claimant; and Brigitte Stern, a national of France,
appointed by the Respondent.

On 29 September 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the
ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”),
notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that
the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Luisa
Fernanda Torres, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the
Tribunal.

On 29 September 2014, the President of the Tribunal proposed to the Parties the
appointment of an assistant to the Tribunal. Both Parties confirmed their agreement
on that same day.

On 9 December 2014, with the approval of the other Members of the Tribunal, the
President of the Tribunal proposed that Ms. Sabina Sacco be appointed as the
assistant to the Tribunal. On 12 January 2015, both Parties approved the
appointment.

FIRST SESSION

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), and in accordance with the Parties’
agreement to extend the 60-day deadline set forth in Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a
first session with the Parties on 22 January 2015 by telephone conference.

Following the first session, on 17 February 2015, the President of the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 1 on behalf of the Tribunal. Procedural Order No. 1 provides,
inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules are those in effect from 10 April 2006,
that the procedural languages are English and Spanish, and that the place of the
proceeding is Washington, DC. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out the Procedural
Calendar for the jurisdictional phase of these proceedings.

PARTIES’ WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS AND PROCEDURAL APPLICATIONS

On 17 June 2015, following a request from the Claimant agreed upon by the
Respondent, the Tribunal amended the Procedural Calendar (“Revision No. 1”).
According to the revised Procedural Calendar, the Claimant’s Memorial on the Merits
was due on 10 July 2015.

On 13 July 2015, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties observing that the Claimant had
failed to file its Memorial on the Merits on the due date and inviting explanations from
the Claimant, to be followed by observations from the Respondent.

On 15 July 2015, the Claimant’s counsel provided explanations relating to its inability
to obtain client instructions as a result of the resignation of all of the Claimant's
directors and officers. The Claimant's counsel requested a temporary suspension of
the Procedural Calendar.

Following an invitation from the Tribunal, on 24 July 2015, the Respondent opposed
the suspension request, and asked the Tribunal to declare the Claimant in default
under ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3). In addition, the Respondent sought an order for
discontinuance of the proceeding under ICSID Arbitration Rule 44 (the “Respondent's
Request for Discontinuance”). In the alternative, the Respondent sought an order for
security for costs (the “Respondent's Request for Security for Costs”) coupled with a
revision to the Procedural Calendar. The Respondent's submission was
accompanied by one legal authority.

On 27 July 2015, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide by 10 August 2015
observations on the Respondent's Requests for Discontinuance and Security for
Costs.

On 10 August 2015, the Claimant’s counsel requested an extension of the deadline to
file its observations, citing again inability to obtain client instructions as a result of the
Claimant's lack of directors and management.

On 14 August 2015, the Respondent stated that it did not consent to the extension
request, and insisted that the proceeding be discontinued “immediately” pursuant to

23.

24.

25.

ICSID Arbitration Rule 44, on grounds of lack of opposition from the Claimant. The
Respondent also raised a further issue relating to the transfer of certain property in

Costa Rica.

On 20 August 2015, the Tribunal granted the Claimant an extension until 1
September 2015 to provide observations on the Respondent's Requests for
Discontinuance and Security for Costs of 24 July 2015, and the transfer of property
issue raised in the Respondent's letter of 14 August 2015. On 1 September 2015, the
Claimant’s counsel informed the Tribunal that it still was not in a position to receive
client instructions to respond, and reiterated the request for a temporary suspension
of the Procedural Calendar. On 1 September 2015, the Respondent provided further

observations on the matter.

On 8 September 2015, the Tribunal gave the following directions to the Parties:

[1

At this stage, the Tribunal is of the view that it cannot order the
discontinuance requested by the Respondent. This request has been
made under Rule 44 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which addresses
discontinuance of the proceedings at the request of a party. According to
the Explanatory Notes to Rule 44 in the 1968 version of the Rule (which
is identical to its 2006 version), ‘under this Rule the agreement (express
or implied) of both parties must be secured for discontinuance’ (Note C).
The Claimant has not consented to the discontinuance, neither expressly
nor impliedly. To the contrary, although it has not made a formal
objection, it has stated that ‘a discontinuance of the proceeding [...]
would cause significant prejudice to the Claimant.’ The Tribunal
understands this to be an implied objection.

That being said, the present state of uncertainty cannot last indefinitely.
As noted in the Explanatory Notes cited above, ‘this Rule provides that if
either party wishes to discontinue the proceeding unilaterally, the
acquiescence of the other party must be obtained; but, so as not to
permit such party to block a discontinuance by inaction, intentional or
unintentional, a time limit is to be set for its response’ (Note B). The
Tribunal already set one time limit for this purpose, of which the Claimant
now requests an extension. Given the special circumstances
surrounding the Claimant's corporate organization and management, the
Tribunal is willing to extend this deadline for an additional three weeks,
ie. until 29 September 2015. If by then the Claimant does not indicate
clearly whether it wishes to pursue this arbitration and present a formal
objection to the discontinuance requested by the Respondent, the
Tribunal will apply Rule 44 and deem that the Claimant has acquiesced in
the discontinuance.

The Respondent's request for security for costs is deferred until the
Tribunal’s final ruling on the discontinuance, if at that stage the request
remains applicable.

On 29 September 2015, the Claimant filed a submission in response to the
Respondent’s Requests for Discontinuance and Security for Costs, and renewed its

request for a temporary suspension of the Procedural Calendar.

This submission

was accompanied by exhibits C-008 to C-012,' and legal authorities CL-001 to
CL-014.

On 2 October 2015, the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent's Requests for
Discontinuance and Security for Costs. The Tribunal further invited the Parties to
confer and submit by 16 October 2015 a joint proposal for a revised Procedural
Calendar, or individual proposals if an agreement was not possible.

Following various requests for extension, on 6 November 2015, each Party filed a
communication to the Tribunal setting forth its position concerning the Procedural
Calendar. The Claimant submitted an additional communication on 7 November
2015, and the Respondent on 9 November 2015.

On 10 November 2015, the Tribunal ruled on the Parties’ disagreement over the
timetable, and established a new Procedural Calendar (“Revision No. 2”).

On 23 December 2015, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits, accompanied by
exhibits C-001 to C-350;? legal authorities CL-001 to CL-100;° two (2) witness
statements, by Mr. Eric Rauguth and Mr. Juan Carlos Hernandez, respectively; and
two (2) expert reports by FTI Consulting Inc. and Roscoe Postle Associates Inc.,
respectively.*

On 14 January 2016, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had entered into a
funding agreement with Vannin Capital PCC in connection with the present
proceeding. On 18 January 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that no conflict
arose for any of the Members of the Tribunal as a result of this arrangement. It
further invited the Respondent to provide any observations it may have in connection
with the Claimant's third party funding arrangement within one week. No
observations were received from the Respondent.

On 21 March 2016, following a request from the Respondent agreed upon by the
Claimant, the Tribunal amended the Procedural Calendar (“Revision No. 3”).

On 8 April 2016, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction,® accompanied by
exhibits R-001 to R-117; legal authorities RL-001 to RL-131; and one (1) expert report
by Mr. Carlos Ubico.

The document designated as C-008 differs from another document previously submitted using
the same numerical designation. See supra, § 7.

The same documents designated as exhibits C-001 to C-008 had been previously submitted.
See supra, J 7 and 25.

The documents designated as CL-001 to CL-014 in this submission differ from those
previously submitted under the same numerical designation. See supra, § 25.

On 26 December 2015, the Claimant submitted a Revised CER-RPA 1 and a Revised CER-
FTI Consulting 1. On 6 January 2016, with the Respondent's agreement, the Claimant
submitted a Revised Memorial on the Merits.

On 9 May 2016, with the Claimant’s agreement, the Respondent submitted a Revised
Memorial on Jurisdiction.

Following a prior exchange of requests for document production among the Parties,
on 20 May 2016, the Respondent submitted to the Tribunal its objections to the
Claimant’s requests for document production. On that same date, the Claimant
informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to the Respondent's single request for
document production.

On 27 May 2016, the Claimant submitted its replies to the Respondent’s objections
on document production, together with exhibits C-352 to C-354.

On 10 June 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 on document
production.

On 7 July 2016, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, accompanied
by exhibits C-351 to C-423; legal authorities CL-101 to CL-211:° one (1) witness
statement by Mr. Juan Carlos Hernandez; and three (3) expert reports by Ms. Ana
Virginia Calzada, Mr. Rubén Hernandez together with Mr. Erasmo Rojas, and FTI
Consulting Inc., respectively.

On 4 August 2016, following a request from the Respondent agreed upon by the
Claimant, the Tribunal once more amended the Procedural Calendar (“Revision No.
4’).

On 30 September 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had
agreed on a short extension for the submission of its Reply on Jurisdiction and
Observations on the Non-Disputing Party Submission, which was due that day.

On 1 October 2016, the Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction and Observations
on the Non-Disputing Party Submission, accompanied by exhibits R-118 to R-145;
legal authorities RL-140 to RL-181; and one (1) expert report by Mr. Carlos Ubico.

On 16 December 2016, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and
Observations on the Non-Disputing Party Submission, accompanied by exhibits C-
075 (revised), C-424 to C-444; legal authorities CL-212 to CL-238; one (1) witness
statement, by Mr. Juan Carlos Hernandez; and two (2) expert reports by Ms. Ana
Virginia Calzada, and Mr. Rubén Hernandez together with Mr. Erasmo Rojas,
respectively.

NON-DISPUTING PARTY APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION

On 15 September 2014, prior to the constitution of the Tribunal, the Asociacién
Preservacionista de Flora y Fauna Silvestre (‘APREFLOFAS”) filed a “Petition for
Amicus Curiae Status,” together with exhibit P-1 (“‘APREFLOFAS'’s Petition’).

On 20 February 2015, the Tribunal informed APREFLOFAS that (i) it had received
APREFLOFAS’s Petition upon constitution; (ii) pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule

The same documents designated as exhibits C-351 to C-354 and legal authorities CL-101 to
CL-109 had been previously submitted. See infra, § 45 and supra, J 34.

37(2), it had invited the Parties to provide observations; and (iii) as a result of the
Procedural Calendar set forth for such observations, a ruling on the Petition should
not be expected until November 2015.

On 3 December 2015, APREFLOFAS filed a request for the Tribunal to rule on its
Petition of 15 September 2014.

On 4 December 2015, the Tribunal informed APREFLOFAS that as a result of
modifications to the Procedural Calendar, the Parties’ observations on
APREFLOFAS’s Petition had been delayed until April 2016. In consequence, the
Tribunal now expected to issue its ruling on APREFLOFAS'’s Petition in May 2016.

On 29 April 2016, the Respondent filed a Submission on APREFLOFAS’s Petition,
together with legal authorities RL-132 to RL-139. On that same date, the Claimant
filed its Submission on APREFLOFAS'’s Petition, together with exhibit C-351, and
legal authorities CL-101 to CL-109.

On 1 June 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 on APREFLOFAS’s
Petition. The Tribunal authorized APREFLOFAS to file a written submission, and
granted it access to selected portions of the Parties’ pleadings, subject to
confidentiality restrictions. On 7 June 2016, both Parties consented to the publication
of Procedural Order No. 2.

On 8 June 2016, APREFLOFAS received the pleading excerpts authorized by the
Tribunal.

On 19 July 2016, APREFLOFAS filed its Non-Disputing Party Submission, together
with exhibits NDP-001 to NDP-013 (“APREFLOFAS’s Submission” or the “Non-
Disputing Party Submission”).

On 18 August 2016, following a request from the Tribunal, APREFLOFAS submitted
translations of certain exhibits filed with its Non-Disputing Party Submission. Those
translations were designated as exhibits NDP-014 to NDP-020.

The Parties presented their Observations on APREFLOFAS’s Submission together
with their respective Reply and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.”

FACTS RELEVANT TO JURISDICTION

The facts summarized below are provided to give context to the Parties’ jurisdictional
arguments. The Tribunal has assessed these facts to the extent necessary to
determine the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility raised by the Parties. The
Tribunal will engage in a more comprehensive assessment of the facts during the
merits phase, if appropriate.

ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAS CRUCITAS PROJECT

On 7 June 1993, Vientos de Abangares, S.A. (a company incorporated by a
Canadian geologist) obtained an exploration permit for the Las Crucitas Project
area.'°

On 16 June 1993, Vientos de Abangares, S.A. submitted an Environmental Impact
Assessment (“EIA”), which was approved by the National Technical Environmental
Secretariat (the “SETENA’) on 1 October 1993."

In January 1996, the exploration permit was transferred to Placer Dome de Costa
Rica, S.A. (a subsidiary of the Canadian mining company Placer Dome International),
and its term was extended to 18 September 1999.'?

In 1997, President Figueres and the Minister of the Environment issued a decree that
declared mining to be an industry of national convenience. "*

In 1998, Placer Dome de Costa Rica S.A. was sold to Lyon Lake Mines, Ltd., and its
name was changed to Industrias Infinito S.A. (“Industrias Infinito”).

Between 1993 and 2000, Industrias Infinito allegedly performed drilling and studies to
prove the existence and extent of the gold deposit. In particular:

a. In 1996, Industrias Infinito completed an extensive pre-feasibility study,'* which
was accompanied by several reports and reviews on the viability of the project.'®

b. Industrias Infinito also commissioned other studies and reports addressing the
environmental and socio-economic impact of the project.'®

c. In 1999, Industrias Infinito completed a comprehensive feasibility study that
allegedly proved the existence of a substantial gold deposit in the Las Crucitas
area.'? According to the Claimant, under the Mining Code this gave Industrias
Infinito the exclusive right to obtain an exploitation concession."

Environment and Energy (“MINAE”), and requested an exploitation concession to
develop a surface gold mine at Las Crucitas."?

In May 2000, the Claimant (then known as Vannessa Ventures Ltd.) acquired
Industrias Infinito.?°

Between 2000 and 2001, Industrias Infinito continued the exploration work and
obtained an updated resource estimate.*' The Claimant also alleges that it launched
a reforestation initiative, planted 20,000 trees,” and built relationships with local
communities and governments.”

On 7 June 2001, the DGM approved the feasibility study, including the socio-
economic and environmental impacts of the project.**

On 17 December 2001, Industrias Infinito obtained its exploitation concession, with a
ten-year term subject to extensions and one renewal, allowing it to extract, process
and sell the minerals from the Las Crucitas gold deposit.> The concession became
effective on 30 January 2002, and is hereinafter referred to as the “2002
Concession.””® However, according to the Claimant, the exploitation activities could
not begin until an EIA for the project was approved by the SETENA.?” According to
the Respondent, the validity of the 2002 Concession was conditioned upon the
subsequent approval of an EIA.

In March 2002, Industrias Infinito submitted its EIA to the SETENA for its approval.”°

MEASURES THAT AFFECTED THE LAS CRUCITAS PROJECT

On 13 February 2002, Mr. Abel Pacheco, at the time a presidential candidate, filed a
challenge before the MINAE, requesting the revocation of Industrias Infinito’s 2002
Concession, alleging that it was against the national interest and endangered the

constitutional right to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment.®° Due to
similar challenges before the Supreme Court, the MINAE deferred its decision on this
challenge.

On 1 April 2002, environmental activists Carlos and Diana Murillo filed an amparo
petition (constitutional challenge) against the resolution that granted Industrias
Infinito’s 2002 Concession on environmental grounds (the “Murillo Amparo”).

On 8 May 2002, Mr. Abel Pacheco took office as President of Costa Rica. On 5 June
2002, President Pacheco declared an indefinite moratorium on open-pit mining (the
“2002 Moratorium’).°' It is undisputed that the 2002 Moratorium operated
prospectively, and did not affect acquired (vested) rights.°?

On 12 August 2002, Rio Minerales S.A. filed an amparo petition against the 2002
Moratorium, arguing that it violated the principles of legality, judicial certainty and non-
retroactivity, as well as its vested rights. On 20 August 2002, the Constitutional
Chamber of the Supreme Court declared that the 2002 Moratorium did not violate the
petitioner's rights and was not retroactive in light of its grandfathering provision.**

The Claimant alleges that this decision confirmed that Industrias Infinito’s rights (in
particular, the 2002 Concession) were not affected by the 2002 Moratorium.*
Despite this, the SETENA had not yet ruled on Industrias Infinito’s EIA, which had
been requested in March 2002. For this reason, on 10 March 2003, Industrias Infinito
filed an amparo petition requesting the Constitutional Chamber to compel the
SETENA to issue its decision on Industrias Infinito’s ElA.*°

The next day, on 11 March 2003, the SETENA denied approval of the EIA, on the
grounds that it required a declaration by the Executive that the project was in the
national interest, which was lacking, and that the request showed certain technical
deficiencies.*° However, it did not disclose the reports which had served as the basis
for its conclusions. As a result, on that same day Industrias Infinito appealed this
decision before the MINAE.°” The MINAE agreed with Industrias Infinito, and on
20 October 2003 ordered the SETENA to conduct a new evaluation of Industrias
Infinito’s application.*®

Industrias Infinito also filed on 21 April 2003 a second amparo petition with the
Constitutional Chamber against the SETENA for violation of due process, requesting
disclosure of the reports.*® The Constitutional Chamber ultimately agreed with
Industrias Infinito and, on 25 August 2004, it compelled the SETENA to provide
copies of any internal and external assessments of the EIA.*°

In the meantime, on 4 April 2003, the Claimant filed its first Notice of Dispute with the
Ministry of Commerce.*

On 26 November 2004, the Constitutional Chamber granted the Murillo Amparo.
Specifically, it held that Industrias Infinito’s 2002 Concession violated Article 50 of the
Constitution, which guarantees the right to a healthy and ecologically balanced
environment, because that concession was granted prior to the approval of the EIA.
It thus annulled the 2002 Concession, “todo sin perjuicio de lo que determine el
estudio de impacto ambiental,"** which the Respondent translates as “without
prejudice to what the environmental impact assessment may determine,” while the

concession was the approval of the ElA.*”

On 31 October 2007, the MINAE granted Mr. Pacheco’s 2002 challenge against
Industrias Infinito’s 2002 Concession, on the basis of the Constitutional Chambers’
2004 finding that the 2002 Concession violated Article 50 of the Constitution.®

On 1 January 2008, the new Code of Contentious Administrative Procedure (which
created the Contentious Administrative Tribunal (“TCA”)) entered into force.“°

On 4 February 2008, the SETENA approved a revised EIA.°°

On 18 March 2008, President Arias issued a decree repealing the 2002 Moratorium,
which entered into force on 4 June 2008.°"

On 21 April 2008, President Arias and the MINAE granted Industrias Infinito an
exploitation concession (the “2008 Concession”, also referred to simply as the
“Concession’), using the administrative law concept of “conversion” (i.e., the previous
annulled concession is converted into a valid one). The Parties agree that the
applicable concept is conversion, but dispute its legal effect.‘

On 13 October 2008, President Arias designated the Las Crucitas Project as one of
national interest.°*

On 17 October 2008, the National System of Areas Conservation (“SINAC”)
authorized the logging of trees on the land of the Las Crucitas Project.®* Industrias
Infinito commenced logging the same day.*>

The NGO FECON filed a similar amparo petition somewhat later on 23 October
2008.5”

On 20 October 2008, the Constitutional Chamber issued a temporary injunction
suspending the forest-clearing operations, the execution of the Las Crucitas Project,
and the implementation of the decree declaring the project in the national interest. °°

In November 2008, Mr. Jorge Lobo and APREFLOFAS filed challenges before the
TCA requesting the annulment of various administrative acts, including:

a. The SETENA resolution declaring the environmental viability of the project.

b. The SETENA resolution approving the modification of the Las Crucitas Project.
c. The MINAE resolution granting the 2008 Concession.

d. The Executive Decree declaring the project in the national interest.*°

The petitioners also requested the TCA to order Industrias Infinito and Costa Rica to
restore the site and provide compensation for environmental damage.

On 16 April 2010, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court denied
UNOVIDA’s and FECON’s amparo petitions and lifted the injunction against forest-
clearing operations (the “2010 Constitutional Chamber Decision”). The decision did
not refer to the impact of the 2002 Moratorium.®

Also on 16 April 2010, the TCA issued its own temporary injunction preventing the
Las Crucitas Project from moving forward.

On 29 April 2010, President Arias issued a decree declaring a new moratorium on
open-pit gold mining, which entered into force on 11 May 2010 (the “Arias Moratorium
Decree’”).®

On 8 May 2010, President Chinchilla took office. On that same day, President
Chinchilla issued a decree which expanded the Arias Moratorium Decree (the
“Chinchilla Moratorium Decree” and, together with the Arias Moratorium Decree, the
“2010 Moratorium” or “2010 Executive Moratorium”). In addition to prohibiting open-
pit gold mining, it prohibited all mining activities using cyanide and mercury in the
processing of ore.** The Chinchilla Moratorium Decree entered into force on 11 May
2010.

On 27 July 2010, President Chinchilla issued a letter acknowledging the 2010
Constitutional Chamber Decision and the possibility of Government liability if the 2008
Concession was cancelled.

Meanwhile, on 11 June 2010, environmental activists Carlos and Douglas Murillo filed
an amparo petition with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court on the
basis that Industrias Infinito’s Concession was in breach of the 2002 Moratorium.®
The Constitutional Chamber rejected this petition on 24 August 2010, on the grounds
that it lacked jurisdiction to review the legality of the exploitation concession (including
its conversion) and that of the related administrative acts.°”

On 24 November 2010, the TCA issued an oral summary of its decision on the
annulment request filed by Mr. Lobos and APREFLOFAS, declaring that all requests
for annulment had been granted (the “2010 TCA Decision”). The TCA issued its full
written decision on 14 December 2010, where, inter alia, it dismissed the res
judicata defense raised by Industrias Infinito and the Government,” and annulled
Industrias Infinito’s 2008 Concession together with related administrative decisions.”

As a result, the TCA ordered inter alia:
a. The MINAE to cancel the 2008 Concession.”

b. Industrias Infinito and the Government to facilitate the restoration of the site, with
the quantum of damages to be determined in a different TCA proceeding.”

c. The file to be transmitted to the prosecutor to determine whether criminal
proceedings should be initiated against Government officials (including President
Arias).

In December 2010, the Costa Rican legislature enacted an amendment to the Mining
Code with essentially the same scope as the Chinchilla Moratorium Decree (the
“2011 Legislative Moratorium”), which came into force on 10 February 2011. The
Claimant alleges that this moratorium “supplanted” the previous decrees,”° but the
Respondent asserts that it did not repeal the previous decrees; rather, it provided an
additional legislative safeguard against open-pit mining.’®

On 11 November 2011, Industrias Infinito requested the Constitutional Chamber to
declare that the 2010 TCA Decision was unconstitutional because it conflicted with
the Constitutional Chamber's earlier decisions, in particular the 2010 Constitutional
Chamber Decision.”®

On 30 November 2011, the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court denied
Industrias Infinito’s cassation request, and upheld the main conclusions of the 2010
TCA Decision (the “2011 Administrative Chamber Decision”).®°

On 9 January 2012, the MINAE canceled Industrias Infinito’s 2008 Concession (the
“2012 MINAE Resolution”).8' According to Infinito, it also declared the Las Crucitas
area to be free of all mining rights.®* Costa Rica disputes this last fact.®

On 19 June 2013, the Constitutional Chamber dismissed Industrias_ Infinito’s
unconstitutionality challenge, holding that the challenge was inadmissible because
the Administrative Chamber had already issued its ruling (the “2013 Constitutional
Chamber Decision”).®*

On 24 November 2015, the TCA determined the amount of compensation for
environmental damage to be paid by Costa Rica, the SINAC and Industrias Infinito at
USD 6.4 million (the “2015 TCA Damages Decision’).®°

In December 2015, the Government filed an appeal against the 2015 TCA Damages
Decision with the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court.

and merits. This Decision addresses the Respondent's objections to the jurisdiction
of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.

The Law Applicable to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal

It is undisputed that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is governed by the ICSID Convention
and the BIT. The relevant provisions are quoted in Sections IV.B and IV.C infra.

Both Parties agree that the interpretation of the ICSID Convention and the BIT is
governed by the customary international law principles on treaty interpretation as
codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (“VCLT”).

It is also undisputed that the Tribunal has the power to rule on its own jurisdiction.

Relevance of APREFLOFAS’s Non-Disputing Party Submission

Before addressing the Parties’ positions on jurisdiction, the Tribunal will address the
comments on jurisdiction made by the Asociacién Preservacionista de Flora y Fauna
Silvestre (“‘APREFLOFAS’) in its Non-Disputing Party Submission.

a. APREFLOFAS’s Submission

APREFLOFAS, who was one of the plaintiffs in the proceedings that culminated with
the 2010 TCA Decision, asserts that Industrias Infinito’s Concession “was always
illegal under the law of Costa Rica (as it applies to any party, foreign or not)” and
“granted through an evident and intentional disregard of the applicable laws, and, as
alleged by Prosecutors in cases before the Costa Rica Courts, likely through
corruption and graft.”®

In compliance with the Tribunal’s directions in Procedural Order No. 2, APREFLOFAS
has limited its submission to factual and legal material not mentioned by the Parties.
Specifically, it submits that (i) “the Concession was illegal under the laws of Costa
Rica,” and (ii) “Costa Rica courts have found that the events that led to the grant of
the Concession were so egregious as to be likely criminal,” leading to the prosecution
of various public officers involved in the granting of the Concession.®” In
APREFLOFAS's view, “[bJoth arguments should [...] lead this Tribunal to rule that it
does not have jurisdiction over Infinito’s claims under the rules of the ICSID, the BIT
and the prevailing view from several previous decisions by international investment
law tribunals.”

More specifically, APREFLOFAS alleges that the approval of Industrias Infinito’s
Concession “would have been impossible unless Infinito and the government officials

Submission”), § 2.

126.

described the Concession in a fraudulent manner” and that “[bJoth Infinito Gold and
Government [oJfficials misrepresented the nature and scope of the Concession by
failing even to consider the real environmental consequences of the Concession,
illegally transforming a public road into a part of the private Concession and by the
invalid conversion of an already annulled administrative act.”*? According to
APREFLOFAS, this arises from the 2010 TCA Decision,°° the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision,*' a Prosecutor Office’s indictment, a trial order from a criminal
judge,°* and a (now annulled) criminal decision acquitting several defendants and
confirming the conviction of former Minister Roberto Dobles.% In particular,
APREFLOFAS alleges that the TCA found that “the decision to grant the permits was
part of a knowing and intentional conspiracy between public servants to disregard the
laws of Costa Rica,” and, as a result, prosecutions and/or sanctions have been
brought against several officials who were responsible for the grant of the
Concession, including former President Arias and former Minister of the Environment
Roberto Dobles.*° According to APREFLOFAS, this shows that “the Costa Rican
courts not only found that the grant of the Concession and the subsequent
‘conversion’ were illegal under Costa Rican Law, but also that there was sufficient
evidence to suggest the occurrence of criminal conduct under the Costa Rican
Criminal Code, such as malfeasance in office or official misconduct.”®

APREFLOFAS notes in particular that, in addition to the criminal investigations
initiated against the public officials involved, a criminal process for extortion
(concusi6n) was initiated against former President Oscar Arias due to an alleged
donation made by Infinito to former President Arias’s non-profit organization
Fundacion Arias Para La Paz. However, this process was abandoned (desestimado)
due to lack of sufficient evidence. APREFLOFAS points out however that, because
the termination (desestimacién) was solely based on the lack of evidence, if new
evidence is presented the case could be reopened.®”

APREFLOFAS further explains that the other criminal prosecutions proceeded to an
indictment, and that after the relevant hearings all of the indicted persons (with the

exception of former Minister Dobles) were acquitted, the court having found that there
was no criminal action because the officials had acted within their discretionary
powers.®° As to Minister Dobles, while he was acquitted for criminal action in the
issuance of Resolution No. R-217-2008-MINAE, he was found guilty of criminal
malfeasance in office for issuing Executive Decree No. 34801-MINAET (the decree
declaring that the Las Crucitas Project was in the national interest).°° However, the
trial court’s decision acquitting the public officials and convicting former Minister
Dobles was ultimately annulled on appeal and remanded for a new hearing. As of the
date of APREFLOFAS’s Submission, no decision on the remanded case had been
rendered. "°°

APREFLOFAS submits that the pending criminal proceedings and the facts upon
which they are based have a significant bearing on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, as
they will determine whether there was corruption and violation of Costa Rica’s
criminal law.'°' Relying on Metal-Tech, Inceysa and Fraport |, APREFLOFAS argues
that investment tribunals lack jurisdiction if the claimant violated the host State’s laws
in the process of its investment activities. APREFLOFAS notes that Article I(g) of
the BIT expressly defines investment as “any kind of asset owned or controlled either
directly, or indirectly through an enterprise or natural person of a third State, by an
investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of other Contracting Party in
accordance with the latter's laws [...].""°° Accordingly, for an investment to be
considered as such, it needs to have been “initiated and developed” in accordance
with the laws of Costa Rica.'°* For APREFLOFAS, this is not the case here, because
Industrias Infinito obtained an_ illegal concession through alleged criminal
collaboration with a number of public officers. As a result, APREFLOFAS submits
that this case is outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, which is limited to the protection of
legal investments controlled by the BIT.'°°

b. |The Respondent’s Comments on APREFLOFAS’s Submission

The Respondent alleges that its factual presentation and legal arguments are fully
supported by APREFLOFAS’s Submission. It notes, in particular, that the
APREFLOFAS’s Submission recognizes that the Concession was annulled by the
2010 TCA Decision, and that the Administrative Chamber denied a cassation request
against that decision after an extensive analysis of Industrias Infinito’s allegations. '°

The Respondent further asserts that APREFLOFAS’s Submission supports its
interpretations of domestic law and of the BIT relevant to its jurisdictional objections.
In particular, it agrees that Infinito’s claims amount to a mere disagreement with Costa
Rican courts on matters of domestic law, and that the BIT does not permit recourse to
arbitration where a party has sought and failed to obtain a remedy in domestic
courts. ©”

The Respondent also notes that, while APREFLOFAS urges the Tribunal to decline
jurisdiction to hear the case, its focus is different to the Respondent's, as it requests
the Tribunal to base its decision on the illegal nature of Industrias Infinito’s
Concession as a matter of domestic and international law. The Respondent finds this
difference in focus “hardly surprising,” given that the Tribunal had ordered
APREFLOFAS to limit its submission to factual and legal material not put forward by
the Parties. That said, the Respondent disagrees with the substance of
APREFLOFAS’s jurisdictional argument. Specifically, it states:

[...] Costa Rica does not believe that the evidence available to date is
sufficient to sustain such a jurisdictional objection, ie., that the entirety of
Infinito’s investment was procured through fraud, corruption or other
malfeasance such that it fails to qualify as a bona fide investment under
the BIT and the ICSID Convention. As the summary provided by
APREFLOFAS shows, the numerous investigations of public officials for
corruption and other crimes in relation to the granting of the 2008
Concession are either still ongoing or have resulted in dismissal of the
charges. '°°

Despite this, the Respondent considers that the evidence provided by APREFLOFAS
could be relevant for the Tribunal, especially if the case were to proceed to the merits,
where the Tribunal would have to review in greater detail the nature of Infinito’s rights
and the manner in which they were obtained.‘

c. The Claimant’s Comments on APREFLOFAS’s Submission

The Claimant contends that APREFLOFAS'’s allegations are factually and legally

personnel or advisors, has ever been found liable for, or even charged with,
intentional wrongdoing. The Claimant also denies having purposefully omitted or
concealed information from the Costa Rican Government in connection with the
Concession or the ElA.""!

Second, there have been no conclusive findings of wrongdoing against any Costa
Rican officials in connection with actions related to the Las Crucitas Project. In any
event, the only charges were for the technical misapplication of Costa Rican law
(delito de prevaricato); and corruption has never been an issue. Not a single Costa
Rican official has been convicted or charged with corruption. As to the charges for
prevaricato, there have been no convictions of public officials. In particular, the
conviction of former Minister Dobles was annulled due to a flawed procedure, and a
new proceeding is pending. '!?

In any event, the Claimant argues that Costa Rica cannot be shielded from the
protections of the BIT by the wrongdoing of its own officials. Relying on RDC,
Fraport | and Kardassopoulos, among others, the Claimant submits that “[ijt is well-
established that states cannot rely on their own wrong-doing to defeat jurisdiction.”"'
According to the Claimant “illegality only undermines BIT protections where the
illegality is a result of intentional and serious wrongdoing by the investor, in deliberate
evasion of domestic law,” which is not the case here.'"*

d. Discussion

APREFLOFAS argues that this Tribunal should decline jurisdiction because the
Claimant’s investment has not been made in accordance with Costa Rican law.
Specifically, it argues that “the Concession was illegal under the laws of Costa Rica,”
and “Costa Rica courts have found that the events that led to the grant of the
Concession were so egregious as to be likely criminal.”'5 In this context, it alleges
that the public officials involved in the granting of the Concession intentionally violated
the law, leading to criminal proceedings for malfeasance in office (prevaricato),
although it recognizes that these proceedings are still pending. APREFLOFAS also

alleges that the Concession was procured through extortion (concusidn), noting that
criminal proceedings were initiated against former President Arias, although it accepts
that these proceedings were terminated for lack of evidence. On the basis of Article
\(g) of the BIT, which contains a legality requirement, APREFLOFAS submits that the
Claimant’s investment is not owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rican law,
and as a result this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear Infinito’s claims.

Notably, both the Claimant and the Respondent disagree with APREFLOFAS. The
Claimant adamantly denies that its investment was established in violation of Costa
Rican law, and in particular, it denies that there is any evidence of corruption or
intentional serious wrongdoing on its part. The Respondent, for its part, expressly
recognizes that the evidence available to date is insufficient to argue that “the entirety
of Infinito’s investment was procured through fraud, corruption or other malfeasance
such that it fails to qualify as a bona fide investment under the BIT and the ICSID
Convention.”""®

The Tribunal has noted the Parties’ positions. However, the legality requirement
contained in the BIT impacts the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, which the Tribunal has a duty
to assess ex officio, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2). As a result, the
Tribunal cannot merely rely on the Parties’ assessment and must engage in its own
inquiry on the basis of the evidence in the record. This is particularly true when there
are allegations of corruption, which is a matter of international public policy.

Article I(g) of the BIT defines “investment” as “any kind of asset owned or controlled
either directly, or indirectly through an enterprise or natural person of a third State, by
an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in
accordance with the latter's laws [...].”"'"7. Hence, to be protected under the BIT, an
investment must have been at the very least established in accordance with Costa
Rican law (the provision could also be understood as requiring that the ownership and
control must be exercised in accordance with Costa Rican law, a matter on which the
Parties have not commented and that can remain open at this juncture).

In the Tribunal’s view, not every violation of domestic law will preclude the investment
from benefitting from the substantive protections of the BIT. However, APREFLOFAS
submits that the Concession was acquired through extortion or through intentional
and/or non-trivial violations of Costa Rican law (malfeasance in office). At this stage
and on the current record, the Tribunal cannot dismiss these allegations outright.
While it has found no clear concrete evidence of malfeasance in office or extortion,
the allegations are serious and the Tribunal cannot ignore that criminal proceedings
have been initiated against public officials for these charges. It therefore defers this
matter to the merits phase when further briefing and evidence may be submitted.

143.

Even in the absence of intentional wrongdoing, APREFLOFAS alleges that the
Concession was obtained in violation of Costa Rican law, and the alleged violations
do not appear to be trivial. Under Article I(g) of the BIT, to determine whether Infinito
has made an investment that is protected under the BIT, the Tribunal must assess
each of these allegations. However, whether the Concession was illegally granted is
intertwined with the merits. Indeed, as this argument was raised by APREFLOFAS
and not by the Parties, the latter have not addressed it in depth and will thus be given
an opportunity to do so during the merits phase. The Tribunal thus finds it
procedurally efficient to defer this matter to the merits phase.

JURISDICTION UNDER THE ICSID CONVENTION

Jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention is governed by Article 25(1), which reads as
follows:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to
the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State,
which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.
When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its
consent unilaterally.

Accordingly, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over this dispute, the following
conditions must be met:

a. There must be a legal dispute.
b. That dispute must arise directly out of an investment.

Cc. The dispute must be between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision
or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a
national of another Contracting State.

d. The parties to the dispute must have consented in writing to submit the dispute to
the Centre. Once given, this consent may not be withdrawn unilaterally.

The Respondent does not challenge conditions (a) to (c). It is thus undisputed — and
rightly so — that the present case concerns a “legal dispute arising directly out of an
investment between a Contracting State [...] and a national of another Contracting
State [...].”. The Respondent's objections to jurisdiction all relate to its consent to
arbitrate, required under condition (d) above and allegedly given in Article XII of the
BIT.

JURISDICTION UNDER THE BIT

Article XII of the BIT reads as follows:

ARTICLE XIl

Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host
Contracting Party

Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the
other Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a
measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in
breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, shall, to the
extent possible, be settled amicably between them.

If a dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six
months from the date on which it was initiated, it may be submitted
by the investor to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4). The
investor will bear the burden of proof to demonstrate:

(a)
(o

that it is an investor as defined by Article | of this Agreement;

that the measure taken or not taken by the Contracting Party is
in breach of this Agreement; and

(c) that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or
arising out of, that breach.

For the purpose of this Agreement, a dispute is considered to be
initiated when the investor of one Contracting Party has delivered
notice in writing to the other Contracting Party alleging that a
measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting Party is in
breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.

An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to
arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:

(a) the investor has consented in writing thereto;

(b) the investor has waived its right to initiate or continue any other
proceedings in relation to the measure that is alleged to be in
breach of this Agreement before the courts or tribunals of the
Contracting Party concerned or in a dispute settlement
procedure of any kind;

(c) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which
the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired,
knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the
investor has incurred loss or damage; and

(d) in cases where Costa Rica is a party to the dispute, no
judgement has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding
the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement.

The dispute may be submitted to arbitration under:

(a) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID), established pursuant to the Convention on
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington
D.C. on 18 March, 1965 (‘ICSID Convention’), if both the
disputing Contracting Party and the Contracting Party of the
investor are parties to the ICSID Convention;

34

or

(b) the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID, if either the disputing
Contracting Party or the Contracting Party of the investor, but
not both, is a party to the ICSID Convention; or

(c) an ad hoc arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration
Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law (UNCITRAL) in case neither Contracting Party is a member
of ICSID, or if ICSID declines jurisdiction.

Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the
submission of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance
with the provisions of this Article.

(a) The consent given under paragraph (5), together with either the
consent given under paragraph (3), or any relevant provision of
Annex II, shall satisfy the requirements for:

(i) written consent of the parties to a dispute for purposes of
Chapter II (Jurisdiction of the Centre) of the ICSID
Convention and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules;
and

(ii) an ‘agreement in writing’ for purposes of Article II of the
United Nations Convention for the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York,
June 10, 1958 (‘New York Convention’).

(b) Any arbitration under this Article shall be held in a State that is a
party to the New York Convention, and claims submitted to
arbitration shall be considered to arise out of a commercial
relationship or transaction for the purposes of Article | of that
Convention.

A tribunal established under this Article shall decide the issues in
dispute in accordance with this Agreement, the applicable rules of
international law, and with the domestic law of the host State to the
extent that the domestic law is not inconsistent with the provisions of
this Agreement or the principles of international law.

An investor of one Contracting Party may seek interim injunctive
relief, not involving the payment of damages, before the judicial or
administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party that is a party to the
dispute, according to the latter's domestic legislation, prior to the
institution of the arbitral proceeding.

A tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:

(a)
(b)

monetary damages and any applicable interest;

restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide
that the disputing Contracting Party may pay monetary
damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.

A tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable
arbitration rules.

. An award of arbitration shall be final and binding and shall be

enforceable in the territory of each of the Contracting Parties.

. Any proceedings under this Article are without prejudice to the rights

of the Contracting Parties under Articles [sic] XIII. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, however, it is agreed that neither
Contracting Party shall give diplomatic protection, or bring an

international claim in respect of specific loss or damage suffered by
an investor of that Contracting Party, where such loss or damage is,
or has been, the subject matter of arbitration under this Article,
unless the other Contracting Party fails to comply with the award
rendered in such arbitration.

Overview of the Parties’ Positions

a. Overview of the Respondent's Position

As noted above, the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction relate to the scope of
Costa Rica’s consent to arbitration under the BIT.'1®

As a general matter, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's case is “simply a
rehash of arguments already considered — and unambiguously rejected — by multiple
levels of Costa Rica’s judicial system.”"'? The Claimant's entire case rests on a single
premise: the annulment of the 2008 Concession by the 2010 TCA Decision. While
the Claimant purports to be challenging subsequent acts by other Costa Rican
judicial, executive and administrative organs, it is apparent from its submissions that
its central claim is about the loss of the 2008 Concession, which was annulled by the
2010 TCA Decision. Because the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear a claim based on
the 2010 TCA Decision, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to
hear the Claimant’s case. Specifically, the Respondent puts forward the following
reasons:

First, the Respondent submits that the claims are barred under Article XII(3)(d) of the
BIT, which excludes claims if a “judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court
regarding the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement”:'2°

a. While the Claimant purports to challenge other acts by the Costa Rican judicial,
executive and administrative organs, its complaint is directed to the effects of the
2010 TCA Decision, and as such this is the act that should be deemed to be the
relevant “measure” in this case. As in 2011, the Administrative Chamber of the
Supreme Court has already rendered a decision on the 2010 TCA Decision, the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear the Claimant's claims.

b. Even if one were to consider that the relevant measure is the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision (which the Respondent denies), the latter submits that “there
exist multiple judgments of Costa Rican courts related to that measure within the
meaning of BIT Article XII(3)(d),” in particular because “the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Judgment is itse/f a judgment of a Costa Rican court and is inextricably
related to another judgment of a Costa Rican court, i.e. the 2010 TCA
Judgment.”'21 As a result, “Article XII(3)(d) must [...] be understood to preclude

148.

149.

any challenge either to the 2010 TCA Judgment or to the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Judgment, especially given that the challenge is ultimately based on a
disagreement with the legal conclusions reached by the Costa Rican courts on
matters of domestic law.” 1

c. Likewise, all of the other measures of which the Claimant complains “(a) are
nothing more than vehicles for Claimant's indirect challenge to the 2010 TCA
Judgment, and (b) constitute acts regarding which the Costa Rican judiciary has
already rendered judgment, and are therefore beyond the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
pursuant to Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT.”"75

The Respondent acknowledges however that the Claimant seeks to challenge the
following measures:'*

a. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which upheld the 2010 TCA
Decision.

b. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which denied a separate challenge
on constitutional grounds against the 2010 TCA Decision.

c. The 2012 MINAE Resolution, which executed the 2010 TCA Decision’s order to
cancel the 2008 Concession and remove it from the Mining Registry.

d. The 2011 Legislative Moratorium consolidating the open-pit mining ban
implemented in 2010 through the 2010 Executive Moratorium, which the Claimant
alleges deprived it of the right to seek a new concession after its existing
concession was annulled by the 2010 TCA Decision. '*

Second, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae
to consider Infinito’s claims because “they amount to no more than assertions that
Costa Rica’s judicial authorities incorrectly applied Costa Rican law.”'?° Further,
“[t]his Tribunal is not a court of appeals on matters of domestic law; it may only
consider claims that arise under international law, and more particularly under the
Canada-Costa Rica BIT.”'?” The Claimant's disagreement with the Costa Rican
courts’ decisions on matters of domestic law “cannot serve to magically transform

R-Mem. Jur., 4. The Respondent also included in this list the 2015 TCA Damages Decision,
which quantified the liability for environmental remediation imposed by the 2010 TCA
Decision, but the Claimant has withdrawn its challenge against this decision. C-CM Jur., ] 44;
R-Reply Jur., § 11.

Initially the Respondent appears to consider that the Claimant is also challenging the 2010
Executive Moratorium issued by presidential decrees in 2010 (R-Mem. Jur., § 4), but in later
submissions it appears to acknowledge that the Claimant is challenging only the 2011
Legislative Moratorium. R-Reply Jur., § 9(d).

R-Mem. Jur., § 12.
R-Mem. Jur., § 12 (emphasis in original).

150.

[Infinito’s] complaint from a purely domestic-law argument to a legitimate claim under
international law (whether for ‘expropriation,’ breach of ‘fair and equitable treatment,’
‘denial of justice,’ or anything else),” because ‘[a]ll of these standards require
evidence of fundamental failures of justice that go well beyond mere disagreement
with a court’s reasoning.” And while the Claimant does allege that it faced a
fundamental failure by the Costa Rican judicial system to reconcile allegedly
conflicting rulings, this alleged inconsistency was already raised before and
addressed by the Costa Rican courts. 12°

Third, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis, i.e.
that the claims are time-barred under the three-year statute of limitations contained in
Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT.'*° According to the Respondent, “much of Claimant's case
depends on challenges to measures that predate 6 February 2011,” which the
Claimant accepts is the cutoff date for purposes of assessing the applicability of this
provision (the dispute having been submitted to arbitration on 6 February 2014).'9!
More specifically:

a. The Respondent contends that “the main pillars of Claimant's arguments about
Costa Rican law were thoroughly rejected by the 2010 TCA Judgment, which was
officially rendered on 14 December 2010, as well as by earlier decisions of the
Constitutional Chamber that Claimant either ignores or plainly misrepresents.”'?
However, this Tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione temporis to review the
substantive correctness of any of these court decisions, and “[iJt would also be
improper for the Tribunal to find that later-occurring judicial or administrative acts
that merely left in place or applied the 2010 TCA Judgment to constitute
independently justiciable breaches of the BIT.”"%°

b. Nor can the Claimant escape the “fatal implications of the statute of limitations”
for its claim related to the 2010 Moratorium: although Infinito focuses on the
mining code amendment (or 2011 Legislative Moratorium) adopted in late 2010
and effective from 10 February 2011 (i.e., within the limitation period), it ignores
the fact that the 2010 Moratorium was already in force as a result of two earlier
presidential decrees. ‘4

should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor
has incurred loss or damage[.]” Exh. C-0001, Canada-Costa Rica BIT, Art. XII(3)(c).

152.

Fourth, the Respondent contends that even if the Claimant attempts to focus on
actions taken after 6 February 2011, the claims are barred under Section Ill(1) of
Annex | of the BIT. This is because the actions challenged by the Claimant merely
maintain or enforce earlier measures that were designed to ensure that investment in
the territory of Costa Rica is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental
concerns. Such actions are exempt from review by an international arbitral tribunal
under Section III(1) of Annex | of the BIT, so long as the underlying “measures” are
“otherwise consistent” with the BIT."

Fifth, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to present a prima facie
case that there has been a breach of the BIT’s provisions on fair and equitable
treatment (“FET”) (Article Il(a)), full protection and security (Article II(b)), or
expropriation (Article VIII):

a. With respect to the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, under the relevant
BIT provisions the Claimant must prove that the judicial acts challenged amount
to a denial of justice, which it has failed to do. Nor could the Claimant have
acquired any legitimate expectations from the 2010 Constitutional Chamber
Decision that could later have been violated by the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision. 3°

b. With respect to the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, the Claimant appears
to recognize that the rejection of its unconstitutionality complaint was based on
valid procedural grounds. And while it complains of the time that it took to
resolve the case, it does not claim prejudice or damage arising from the delay.'9”

c. With respect to the 2012 MINAE Resolution, the Claimant “fails to present an
intelligible theory for how this Resolution went beyond the 2010 TCA Judgment,
which expressly ordered MINAE to expunge the concession from the Mining
Registry,” nor has it shown that this decision cancelled any of the Claimant’s
additional rights. °°

d. Similarly, the 2015 TCA Damages Decision simply implemented the 2010 TCA
Decision by imposing joint liability on the defendants for environmental
remediation of the Las Crucitas site. The Claimant does not argue that this
decision violated Costa Rican law or was inconsistent with the 2010 TCA
Decision. Nor does it claim any damage arising from that decision. '%

e. As to the ban on open pit-mining, the Claimant has not alleged that the 2011
Legislative Moratorium or the executive decrees that preceded it were illegal or
improperly implemented as a matter of Costa Rican law. In addition, while these

155.

decrees precluded the granting of new mining rights, the Claimant has not
explained how they could have infringed on any right already held by Infinito
(indeed, the Costa Rican courts had found that these decrees did not violate the
petitioners’ acquired rights). Nor has the Claimant shown that it would have been
entitled to obtain a new concession and all the necessary permits to develop the
Las Crucitas Project in the absence of the 2011 Legislative Moratorium.'4°

Sixth, the Respondent submits that none of the five “measures” expressly challenged
by the Claimant were the cause of the damage that it asserts in this arbitration. As a
result, they cannot give rise to a dispute within the meaning of the dispute settlement
provisions in the BIT, which repeatedly refer to the investor's obligation to specify how
it “has incurred loss or damage” as a result of the asserted breach. The Respondent
notes in this regard that Infinito has asserted that its investment had lost its entire
value by November 2011, prior to three of the measures of which it complains. As to
the remaining two measures (the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the
2011 Legislative Moratorium), they could not have caused the damage alleged by the
Claimant.'*"

Seventh, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to comply with the
BIT’s mandatory conditions on the submission of the dispute to arbitration with
respect to the 2015 TCA Damages Decision (which had not even been issued when
the Claimant submitted this dispute to arbitration). Such conditions include a pre-
notification of the dispute to Costa Rica at least six months prior to the initiation of the
arbitration under Article XII(2) of the BIT, and express consent to arbitration and
waiver of the right to domestic law remedies under Article XII(3) of the BIT no later
than the submission of the Request for Arbitration. According to the Respondent,
‘[t]his Tribunal’s jurisdiction is to be assessed as of the time of submission of the
Request to Arbitration, and does not extend to any and all disputes that might arise
subsequent to that date[.]’'4?

Eighth, the Respondent submits that the “Claimant cannot circumvent any of the
jurisdictional flaws described above by selective importation of clauses from Costa
Rica’s investment treaties with third States through the Most Favored Nation (MFN)
clause contained in Article IV of the BIT.” According to the Respondent, “[t]he MFN
clause of the BIT does not provide a license to disregard treaty provisions that were
specifically negotiated and ratified as a package deal by Canada and Costa Rica,” in

R-Mem. Jur., § 25(d).
R-Mem. Jur., 1§ 26-28.

R-Mem. Jur., § 29. Subsequently to this submission, and in light of the Claimant’s withdrawal
of the claim concerning the 2015 TCA Damages Decision, the Respondent stated it was
reducing its objections to jurisdiction to seven, thereby eliminating the objection directed
specifically at the 2015 TCA Damages Decision claim. R-Reply Jur., § 11. During the Hearing
on Jurisdiction, the Respondent explained, however, that “it want[ed] to make sure that the
Tribunal understands that the Claimant cannot claim to withdraw the measure or the claim,
rather, and then, after the jurisdictional objections, assuming that we even get to the merits
stage, that they will somehow revive that measure.” Tr. Day 1 (ENG), 160:16-22 (Mr. Grané).

R-Mem. Jur., § 30.

40

156.

157.

particular as Infinito has failed to identify any third party investor who has been
accorded more favorable treatment in like circumstances.’ A majority of investment
tribunals have found that MFN clauses cannot modify the terms of a BIT’s dispute
resolution clause, especially in cases involving MFN clauses with similar wording as
the one at issue here, or where a claimant seeks to expand the scope of a State’s
consent to arbitration. The Respondent argues in this regard that most of the
provisions it invokes to challenge the jurisdiction of the Tribunal “are not procedural
pre-conditions to arbitration but rather provide clear substantive limits on the type of
dispute Costa Rica has consented to arbitrate,” and “[t]he Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to
go beyond the limits of such consent.”"45

b. Overview of the Claimant’s Position

As a general matter, the Claimant argues that the Respondent impermissibly attempts
to re-characterize Infinito’s case, and that the Respondent's objections are directed to
that reformulated case, not to the case that the Claimant has brought.'“®

The Claimant recalls that in this arbitration it is challenging the following four
measures:

a. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which the Claimant alleges
confirmed the 2010 TCA Decision, “thereby rendering final and irreversible the
annulment of the exploitation concession, environmental approvals, the
declaration of public interest and national convenience, and the land use change
permit.”"47

b. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which Infinito alleges declined to
resolve, on admissibility grounds, the conflict between its earlier decision
upholding the constitutionality of the Las Crucitas Project approvals and the 2010
TCA Decision. '*

c. The 2012 MINAE Resolution, which Infinito alleges cancelled the 2008
Concession and expunged all of Industrias Infinito’s mining rights from the mining
registry, going further than what was ordered by the Administrative Chamber. '4°

d. The 2011 Legislative Moratorium on open-pit mining, which the Claimant alleges
replaced the 2010 Executive Moratorium, prohibiting Industrias Infinito from
applying for new permits. °°

According to the Claimant, “[iJt is the combined operation of these four measures [...]
that meant that Industrias Infinito definitively could no longer pursue the development
of the Crucitas project.”'*' More particularly, the Claimant submits that the composite
result of these measures breached the BIT in four ways:

a. It expropriated the Claimant's investments by definitively precluding Infinito from
building and operating the Crucitas gold mine. '*

b. It breached Costa Rica’s obligation to provide FET to Infinito’s investments, by
violating its legitimate expectations and denying both procedural and substantive
justice to Infinito.1°

¢. It failed to grant Infinito’s investments full protection and security.

d. It breached two substantive obligations imported into the BIT through the BIT’s
MFN clause from other bilateral investment treaties signed by Costa Rica: (i)
Costa Rica’s obligation to do “what is necessary” to protect Infinito’s investments,
imported from the Costa Rica-France bilateral investment treaty, and (ii) the
“umbrella clause” requiring Costa Rica to “comply with [or observe] any obligation
assumed regarding investments of investors of the other Contracting Party,”
found in Costa Rica’s bilateral investment treaties with Taiwan and Korea.'®>

On this basis, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction
must fail for the following reasons:

First, there is no merit to the Respondent’s argument that Infinito’s case is “really” a
challenge to the 2010 TCA Decision, and that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is excluded
under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT because a Costa Rican court has rendered a
judgment with respect to that measure. “It is the investor's prerogative to allege and
formulate its claims as it sees fit,"° and the Respondent cannot reformulate them.
Here, the Claimant is challenging the four measures listed above, and in particular the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which is the measure that rendered Infinito’s
investments substantially worthless. Neither this decision, nor the other measures
challenged by Infinito have been the subject of the judgment of a Costa Rican

court.” According to the Claimant, “Costa Rica ignores the ordinary meaning,
context and purpose of Article XII(3)(d),” which “encourages the pursuit (though does
not require exhaustion) of local remedies while insulating lower domestic judicial
decisions from being challenged under the BIT.”'®® In addition, the Respondent's
interpretation would “gut the investor protections in the BIT by allowing Costa Rica to
shield its measures from challenge merely by ensuring that a judgment of a Costa
Rican court was generated regarding that measure.”'®°

Second, the Claimant contends that the Respondent impermissibly attempts to
reframe its claims so that they fall outside of the three-year limitation period set out in
Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT. The Claimant reiterates that the focus must be on the
claims as it has pleaded them, not as re-characterized by the Respondent. The
Respondent also ignores the plain wording of the provision: Article XII(3)(c) bars a
claim only if three years have elapsed from the time at which the Claimant first
acquired (or should have first acquired) (i) knowledge of the alleged breach and (ii)
knowledge that it has sustained loss or damage. The breaches of the BIT did not
crystallize until the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, at the earliest, because it
was after this decision that Infinito’s investments in Costa Rica became substantially
worthless. As a result, the limitation period did not begin to run before November
2011 at the earliest, and accordingly Infinito’s claims were brought on time.'©°

Third, the Respondent distorts the meaning of Annex |, Section III(1) of the BIT. This
provision only applies to measures “otherwise consistent” with the BIT, i.e., measures
that do not breach other substantive BIT protections. The Respondent's interpretation
undermines the object and purpose of the BIT, which is investment protection.'*' In
addition, the provision only applies to measures sensitive to environmental concerns,
and the Claimant contends that the measures it challenges were not motivated by
bona fide environmental concerns. In particular, “[t]he exploitation concession and
other project approvals were annulled on the basis of the technical application of the
2002 moratorium to the project after the project was deemed environmentally sound
by all competent authorities in Costa Rica and by the Constitutional Chamber,” and
that “[t]he Costa Rican government and environmental authorities defended the
project's environmental soundness before Costa Rican courts.” As a result, Infinito
argues that the Respondent cannot invoke Annex |, Section III(1).

Fourth, while purporting to require the Tribunal to assess whether Infinito has made a
prima facie case on the merits, the Respondent is in fact asking the Tribunal to
determine the merits of the dispute and thus to determine contentious issues of fact
and law that are inappropriate at the jurisdictional stage. According to the Claimant,

C-CM Jur., § 22.

C-CM Jur., Jf] 23-24.

C-CM Jur., § 25.

C-CM Jur., § 26 (emphasis in original).

43

“[a] prima facie analysis requires the Tribunal to accept the facts pleaded as true and
assess whether they could support a claim for breach of the BIT.” The Claimant
asserts that it “has demonstrated Costa Rica’s breaches of the BIT on a balance of
probabilities,” and has thus “more than met its burden to establish prima facie
breaches of the BIT.”"* Specifically:

a. With respect to the FET standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT:

The Claimant argues that no investment tribunal has ever dismissed a claim
for breach of the FET standard because the claimant failed to show a prima
facie case. This is because the determination of the standard is fact-specific
and flexible, and must be assessed in the context of the facts and evidence,
which are a matter for the merits.

In any event, the Claimant rejects the Respondent's argument that the FET
standard of the BIT is equivalent to the minimum standard of treatment under
customary international law (“MST”), and argues that it would be premature
for the Tribunal to determine this question during the jurisdictional phase.

Whether the FET standard is autonomous or limited to the MST, the
Claimant contends that it has “demonstrated that its claims are capable of
breaching the FET standard in Article II(2)(a),” and therefore it has
established a prima facie case that this provision was breached:'®

. With respect to its legitimate expectations claim, the Claimant argues
that the Government provided repeated assurances to Infinito, upon
which Infinito reasonably relied for more than a decade in deciding to
continue investing in the Las Crucitas Project.’ Specifically,
“Industrias Infinito was granted an exploration permit, an exploitation
concession, and several other permits and approvals over the course of
the project's life,” and “[a]t each step, it was encouraged and induced to
continue investing in the project.’"®’ The Claimant further alleges that
“[t]he legality of the Crucitas project’s exploitation concession and
approvals was confirmed in multiple judicial decisions including by the
country’s highest court." That after “these repeated and far-reaching
assurances” “the Administrative Chamber retroactively applied the 2002
moratorium, nine years after it was adopted, and after Infinito had spent
millions developing and building the project in reliance on its mining
rights and that the 2002 moratorium did not apply to its project,”

amounts to a breach of the Claimant's legitimate expectations,
regardless of whether the standard is autonomous or limited to the
MST. 18

. Likewise, the Claimant submits that it has made a prima facie case of a

procedural and substantive denial of justice. Procedurally, the Claimant
contends that the Respondent denied justice to Infinito by failing to
provide a legal system capable of protecting Infinito’s investments,
because it lacked a mechanism to resolve the inconsistency between
the decisions of different chambers of the Supreme Court.
Substantively, the Claimant argues that the Administrative Chamber
denied justice to Infinito by incorrectly and retroactively applying the
2002 Moratorium to the 2008 Concession and other project
approvals. '°

With respect to expropriation, the Claimant contends that it has demonstrated
both on a balance of probabilities and on a prima facie basis that Costa Rica
expropriated its investments both directly and indirectly.'7' In particular, the
Claimant advances the following arguments:

The sole effects doctrine applies to judicial expropriations in the same
manner as it does to other expropriatory measures. '”

Costa Rica cannot argue that the Administrative Chamber was applying the
2002 Moratorium as a defense. This amounts to arguing that Costa Rica
legitimately exercised its police powers, but this defense is not available to
Costa Rica because the application of the 2002 Moratorium was neither
necessary nor proportionate to any legitimate objective and was in breach of
the FET standard.’

Compliance with domestic law is not a defense to expropriation, particularly
where the domestic law in question (the 2002 Moratorium) post-dates the
investment. ‘74

A court decision that applies domestic law may be expropriatory where the
domestic law applied is itself expropriatory or breaches a rule of international
law.'”> Here, the Claimant alleges that, as applied by the Administrative
Chamber, the 2002 Moratorium was in itself expropriatory.

v. The Respondent's argument that a denial of justice is a prerequisite for a
judicial measure to be expropriatory cannot succeed on a prima facie basis.

vi. The Claimant has established beyond a prima facie standard that it had
investments capable of being expropriated. The Respondent’s argument
that Infinito’s rights were not capable of expropriation because they were
deemed invalid by the 2011 Administrative Chamber Judgment should be
rejected: Infinito’s investments extended beyond the 2008 Concession and
other approvals annulled by the Administrative Chamber and were not
capable of being “invalidated” by it. In addition, the validity of the
Concession and other approvals must be assessed independently from the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, because this is the very measure
that the Claimant alleges breached the BIT. In any event, “Costa Rica is
estopped from asserting that the 2002 moratorium rendered Industrias
Infinito’s rights invalid when its own Constitutional Chamber and authorities
represented over the course of more than a decade that the moratorium did
not apply to the project.”'7°

c. Finally, the Claimant submits that it has established on a prima facie basis that
Costa Rica failed to provide full protection and security to its investments in
breach of Article !I(2)(b) of the BIT. The Claimant argues that the Tribunal need
not (and should not) definitively determine the scope of this provision at the
jurisdictional stage.'””

Fifth, the Claimant denies that its case is nothing more than an appeal from the
decisions of Costa Rican courts. This argument inaccurately characterizes and fails
to analyze the claims it has actually made. '7®

Sixth, the Claimant asserts that, contrary to the Respondent's contention, it has
demonstrated its damages case on a balance of probabilities and at the very least on
a prima facie basis.‘ Its losses crystallized on the date of the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision. In any event, it argues that “Infinito’s evidence must be accepted
as true for the purpose of the jurisdictional analysis,” and “[t]he question of the precise
date on which Infinito’s losses crystallized must be left for the merits” and is “irrelevant
to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”'®° The Claimant also denies that it must prove separate
losses for the other measures that it challenges: these measures prevented Industrias
Infinito from obtaining a new exploitation concession and new project approvals, and

169.

thus operated in combination with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision to
render Infinito’s investments substantially worthless. '°'

Seventh, the Claimant submits that, through the BIT’s MFN clause (Article IV), it is
entitled to benefit from the more favorable drafting of the dispute settlement
provisions found in the bilateral investment treaties signed by Costa Rica with Taiwan
and Korea, from which the preconditions set out in Article XII(3) are absent. The
Respondent's interpretation ignores the broad wording of Article IV of the BIT, which
includes more favorable substantive and procedural protections under other bilateral
investment treaties. Such interpretation also undermines the purpose of Article IV
and the investment protection purpose of the BIT as a whole. In addition, Article
XII(3) is an admissibility and not a jurisdictional provision, and as such does not
define the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, so the Respondent's concerns are inapplicable. '

Finally, although the Claimant withdraws its claim with respect to the 2015 TCA
Damages Decision because it is not final and binding on Industrias Infinito,"® it
reserves its right to challenge as an ancillary measure any future Administrative
Chamber decision that breaches the BIT. The Claimant argues that “[a]lthough the
Tribunal need not determine the issue at this stage, no new notice or amicable
settlement period would be required in respect of this claim because it arises from the
same subject-matter as the measures already challenged by Infinito.”"®

Jurisdictional Requirements under Article XII

The Parties dispute whether Article XII sets out only jurisdictional requirements, or
also admissibility requirements. The Respondent submits that all of the requirements
set out in Article XII are jurisdictional, because they establish the scope of Costa
Rica’s consent to arbitration. By contrast, the Claimant argues that the relevant
jurisdictional requirements are found in Article XII(2), in conjunction with Costa Rica’s
unilateral consent to arbitrate provided under Article XII(5), while those in Article XII(3)
are conditions for admissibility. '®

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that most (but not all) of the requirements in
Article XII are jurisdictional, as they determine the conditions under which Costa Rica
has consented to submit claims to arbitration. Jurisdictional requirements are
obviously first found in Article XII(1) of the BIT, read together with Article XII(2), which
provide as follows:

1. Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the
other Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a

47

measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in
breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, shall, to the
extent possible, be settled amicably between them.

2. If a dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six
months from the date on which it was initiated, it may be submitted
by the investor to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4). The
investor will bear the burden of proof to demonstrate:

(a)
(b)

that it is an investor as defined by Article | of this Agreement;

that the measure taken or not taken by the Contracting Party is
in breach of this Agreement; and

(c) that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or
arising out of, that breach.

For the purpose of this Agreement, a dispute is considered to be
initiated when the investor of one Contracting Party has delivered
notice in writing to the other Contracting Party alleging that a
measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting Party is in
breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.

170. For the Tribunal, not all of the conditions set out in these provisions go to its
jurisdiction. Only the following are jurisdictional requirements:

a. There must be a dispute (Article XII(1)). Read together with Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention, this dispute must be legal in nature.

b. The dispute must be between one Contracting Party to the BIT and an investor of
the other Contracting Party (Article XII(1)).

c. The dispute must relate to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not
taken by the host State is in breach of the BIT (Article XII(1)).

d. The dispute must also relate to a claim “that the investor has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach” (Article XII(1)).

e. A period of six months must have elapsed from the date on which a notice of
dispute has been delivered in accordance with the final paragraph of Article
XII(2)), during which the Parties must have attempted to settle the dispute
amicably, before the claim can be submitted to arbitration (Article XII(2)).'®”

171. By contrast, sub paragraphs (a) to (c) of Article XII(2) do not establish jurisdictional
requirements; they set out rules on burden of proof. Indeed, the provision states that
“[t]he investor will bear the burden of proof to demonstrate: (a) that it is an investor as
defined by Article | of this Agreement; (b) that the measure taken or not taken by the
Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement; and (c) that the investor has
incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.” These rules on
burden of proof will thus apply whenever the relevant requirement needs to be

48

174.

175.

proven, be it at the jurisdictional or at the merits stage. With respect to (a), the
investor must prove that it qualifies as an investor under the BIT during the
jurisdictional phase, because the condition of investor is necessary to establish
jurisdiction. By contrast, the conditions under (b) and (c) of Article XII(2) must be
proven at the merits stage.

Other requirements can be found in Article XII(3), which reads as follows:

3. An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to
arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:

(a) the investor has consented in writing thereto;
(b) the investor has waived its right to initiate or continue any other
proceedings in relation to the measure that is alleged to be in breach

of this Agreement before the courts or tribunals of the Contracting
Party concerned or in a dispute settlement procedure of any kind;

S

not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the
investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of
the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss
or damage; and

(d) in cases where Costa Rica is a party to the dispute, no judgement
has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure
that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement.

Article XII(3)(a) is clearly a jurisdictional requirement, as there can be no jurisdiction
without a party’s consent. Article XII(3)(b) is also jurisdictional in nature: the host
State has not consented to arbitrate if the investor has not waived its right to initiate or
continue other proceedings before the courts of the host State.

The Parties dispute whether the conditions set out in sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Article XII(3) constitute jurisdictional requirements or go to admissibility. As explained
in Section IV.C.4.c infra, in what pertains to Article XII(3)(c) the Tribunal defers this
discussion to the merits phase, should it become relevant at that stage; and in what
pertains to Article XII(3)(d), the Tribunal observes that the matter is of no
consequence (Section IV.C.4.a(iii) infra).

Accordingly, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over this dispute, the following
conditions must be met:

a. There must be a dispute (Article XII(1)). Read together with Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention, this dispute must be legal in nature. The Parties agree (and
rightly so) that there is a legal dispute in this case.

b. The dispute must be between one Contracting Party to the BIT and an investor of
the other Contracting Party (Article XII(1)). Here, the dispute clearly involves one
Contracting Party (Costa Rica). The notion of “investor”, on the other hand, is
defined in Article I(h) as:

(i

) any natural person possessing the citizenship of one
Contracting Party who is not also a citizen of the other
Contracting Party; or

49

188

(ii) any enterprise as defined by paragraph (b) of this Article,
incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with applicable
laws of one Contracting Party;

who owns or controls an investment made in the territory of the
other Contracting Party.

Article l(b) defines “enterprise” as:

(i) any entity constituted or organized under applicable law,
whether or not for profit, whether privately-owned or
governmentally-owned, including any corporation, _ trust,
partnership, sole proprietorship, joint venture or other
association; and

(ii) a branch of any such entity;

For further certainty, ‘business enterprise’ means any enterprise
which is constituted or organized in the expectation of economic
benefit or other business purposes.

In turn, Article I(g) defines “investment” as:

[..-] any kind of asset owned or controlled either directly, or indirectly
through an enterprise or natural person of a third State, by an
investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other
Contracting Party in accordance with the latter's laws and, in
particular, though not exclusively, includes:

(i) movable and immovable property and any related property
rights, such as mortgages, liens or pledges;

(ii) shares, stock, bonds and debentures or any other form of
participation in an enterprise;

(iii) money, claims to money, and claims to performance under
contract having a financial value;

(iv) goodwill;
(v) intellectual property rights;
(vi) rights, conferred by law or under contract, to undertake any

economic and commercial activity, including any rights to
search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources;

but does not mean real estate or other property, tangible or
intangible, not acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of
economic benefit or other business purposes.

For further certainty, investment does not mean, claims to money
that arise solely from:

(i) commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services by a
national or enterprise in the territory of one Contracting Party to
a national or an enterprise in the territory of the other
Contracting Party; or

The Tribunal has omitted the additional definition regarding the term “natural person
possessing the citizenship of one Contracting Party" for Canada, as the Claimant is not a
natural person.

50

(ii) the extension of credit in connection with a commercial
transaction, such as trade financing, where the original maturity
of the loan is less than three years.

Without prejudice to subparagraph (ii) immediately above, a loan to
an enterprise where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor shall
be considered an investment.
For the purpose of this Agreement, an investor shall be considered
to control an investment if the investor has the power to name a
majority of its directors or otherwise to legally direct the actions of
the enterprise which owns the investment.
Any change in the form of an investment does not affect its
character as an investment.
For greater clarity, returns shall be considered a component of
investment. For the purpose of this Agreement, "returns" means all
amounts yielded by an investment, as defined above, covered by
this Agreement and in particular, though not exclusively, includes
profits, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties, fees or other
current income.

The Respondent does not dispute that the Claimant is an investor under this
definition. Indeed, it is undisputed that Infinito is an enterprise duly constituted in
accordance with the applicable laws of Canada, being incorporated in that
country. Nor does the Respondent dispute that Infinito owns or controls an
investment made in the territory of Costa Rica. The Claimant asserts that it owns
or controls the following assets in the territory of Costa Rica: “(i) its shares in
Industrias Infinito; (ii) the money it invested in Industrias Infinito through
intercompany loans; (iii) the exploitation concession; (iv) the pre-existing mining
rights underlying the exploitation concession; (v) the other approvals for the
Crucitas project; (vi) the physical assets associated with the project, including the
half-built mining infrastructure; and (vii) the intangible assets associated with the
project.”"° The Respondent does not contest this. However, as noted in
Section IV.A.3 supra, APREFLOFAS has argued that the Claimant's investment
was not obtained in accordance with Costa Rican law, and therefore does not
meet the definition of investment at Article I(g) of the BIT. As explained in that
same Section, the Tribunal has deferred this matter to the merits.

c. The dispute must relate to a claim by the Claimant that a measure taken or not
taken by Costa Rica is in breach of the BIT (Article XII(1)). Here, there is no
dispute that the Claimant claims that measures taken by Costa Rica are in
breach of the BIT, but the Parties dispute what those measures are and whether
they qualify as “measures” for the purposes of the BIT. This dispute is at the
heart of several of the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction.

d. The dispute must also relate to a claim “that the investor has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach” (Article XII(1)). Again, the

Claimant claims that it has incurred loss or damage arising out of the breaches it
alleges, but the Respondent disputes that this damage could have arisen from

189 C-Mem. Merits, § 219.

51

the measures identified by the Claimant as being in breach of the BIT. This
dispute is also central to one of the Respondent's objections.

e. The Claimant must have consented in writing to submit the dispute to arbitration
(Article XII(3)(a)). There is no dispute that Infinito and Industrias Infinito'®° have
both consented in writing to arbitrate this dispute by filing the Request for
Arbitration and providing written consents to arbitration,'®' with the exception of
the objection directed to the claim regarding the 2015 TCA Damages Decision, a
claim that the Claimant has in any event withdrawn, and an objection that the
Respondent does not presently pursue, as discussed at paragraphs 154 and 167
and note 142 supra. It is noted in this context that the Respondent's consent is
found at Article XII(5), which provides that “[eJach Contracting Party hereby gives
its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration
in accordance with the provisions of this Article.”

f. A period of six months must have elapsed from the date in which a notice of
dispute has been delivered in accordance with the final paragraph of Article
XII(2), during which the Parties must have attempted to settle the dispute
amicably, before the claim can be submitted to arbitration (Article XII(2)). There
is no dispute that this requirement has been met, with the same exception as the
one noted in subparagraph (e) above.

g. The Claimant must have waived its right to initiate or continue any other
proceedings in relation to the measures that are alleged to be in breach of the
BIT before the Costa Rican courts or tribunals or in a dispute settlement
procedure of any kind (Article XII(3)(b)). There is no dispute that both Infinito and
Industrias Infinito have provided the required waiver, '** with the exception of the

In this context, the Tribunal notes that Section II of Annex II of the BIT provides:
“Il. Damage Incurred by a Controlled Enterprise

1. A claim that a Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that an enterprise
that is a juridical person incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with applicable laws
of that Contracting Party has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that
breach, may be brought by an investor of the other Contracting Party acting on behalf of an
enterprise which the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly. In such a case:

objection directed to the claim regarding the 2015 TCA Damages Decision
mentioned in subparagraph (e) above.

In addition, the following two requirements must also be met (whether as a matter of
jurisdiction or admissibility, a debate over which the Tribunal does not presently rule):

a.

Not more than three years must have elapsed from the date on which Infinito first
acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and
knowledge that it had incurred loss or damage (Article XII(3)(c)). The
Respondent disputes that this requirement is met.

No judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure
that is alleged to be in breach of the BIT (Article XII(3)(d)). Compliance with this
requirement is also disputed by the Respondent.

The disagreements noted at (c) and (d) of the preceding paragraph are at the heart of
several of the Respondent's objections. Specifically:

a.

Underlying virtually all of the Respondent's objections is the argument that the
Claimant is formally challenging certain measures, when its case is “really” about
other (previous) measures. The question thus arises whether, for jurisdictional
purposes, the Tribunal must focus on the measures as pleaded or whether it can
re-characterize them, including by determining whether the acts impugned qualify
as “measures” for purposes of the BIT at all.

The Respondent also submits that the claims amount to a disagreement with
Costa Rican courts on matters of domestic law, rather than a genuine claim
under the BIT. While it does not expressly ground this objection on a particular
provision of Article XII, the Tribunal understands that this is related to the
jurisdictional requirement that the dispute must relate to a claim by the Claimant
that a measure taken or not taken by Costa Rica is in breach of the BIT (Article
XII(1)).

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant fails to show a prima facie case
of any of the alleged breaches of the BIT. This objection also appears to be
grounded on the jurisdictional requirement that the dispute must relate to a claim
that a measure taken or not taken by Costa Rica is in breach of the BIT (Article
XII(1)), as well as on Article XII(2)(b).

In addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to articulate
how it suffered losses from the challenged measures. Again, this objection
appears to be based on the jurisdictional requirement that the dispute must relate
to a claim that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising
out of, the breaches alleged (Article XII(1)), and on Article XII(2)(c), according to
which the Claimant bears the burden of proving that it has “incurred loss or
damage.”

The Tribunal will address these issues first, in order to establish whether the main
jurisdictional requirements are met (Section IV.C.3 infra).

The Respondent’s Objections Arising from Article XII(1) and (2)
a. Should the Tribunal Consider the Case as Pleaded by the Claimant?
(i) | The Respondent's Position

At the heart of the Respondent’s objections is the same underlying argument: “the
key measure underlying Infinito’s claims is the annulment of Infinito’s concession by
the 2010 TCA Judgment.”'%? For the Respondent, this is the measure that annulled
the 2008 Concession and other project approvals, an annulment that the Claimant
has recognized “instantly,” rendered its investments “substantially worthless,” and
breached the BIT.'** In other words, the Claimant's case is “really” about the 2010
TCA Decision, and not about the measures formally challenged by the Claimant.

Relying on the expert report of Carlos Ubico, the Respondent asserts that, as a
matter of Costa Rican law, it was the 2010 TCA Decision which ordered the
annulment of the Concession and other approvals, and that it was not in any way
provisional or dependent on any confirmation by the Administrative Chamber of the
Supreme Court.’ Although Industrias Infinito’s cassation request before the
Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court temporarily suspended the execution
of the 2010 TCA Decision, the decision itself remained valid and binding unless
reversed by the Administrative Chamber.'®® This cassation request did not “undo” the
annulment, so that the Administrative Chamber could once more annul it; rather, it
merely constituted pursuit and exhaustion by the Claimant of its local remedies.
Citing James Crawford, the Respondent argues that “the breach of international law
occurs at the time when the treatment occurs” and “[t]he breach is not postponed to a
later date when local remedies are exhausted [...].”""” As stated by the PClJ in the
Phosphates case, a refusal to redress a prior wrong “merely results in allowing the
[allegedly] unlawful act to subsist. It exercises no influence either on the
accomplishment of the act or on the responsibility ensuing from it.”'%

According to the Respondent, the Tribunal is empowered to go beyond a party’s
characterization of its claim. In the context of Article XII(3)(d), when the BIT refers to

a measure that is “alleged to be in breach,” this does not mean that a tribunal must
take the Claimant's word for what is in fact alleged in the complaint. According to the
Respondent, “[nJothing in Article XII(3)(d) divests the Tribunal of the power to
examine what Claimant’s case is actually about,” and “it is clear that the measure
centrally at issue in the case is the TCA’s annulment of Infinito’s 2008 Concession.”'?
The word “alleged” is used to qualify the word “breach” simply because the absence
of that qualifier would be inappropriate when a breach has not yet been
established.20°

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant denies that its case is about the 2010 TCA Decision. It argues that the
Tribunal must focus on the case as it has pleaded it. Contrary to the Respondent’s
contentions, the Claimant asserts that it does not “really” challenge the 2010 TCA
Decision “for the simple reason that that decision was neither final nor the proximate
cause of the loss of Infinito’s rights and damages.”“°' Rather, the Claimant’s case is
that, as a composite whole, the four measures that it challenges (specifically, the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2012 MINAE Resolution, the 2011
Legislative Moratorium, and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision) “had the
combined effect of stripping Infinito of all of its rights, barring it from seeking any sort
of meaningful remedy, and eliminating any possibility of proceeding with the Crucitas
project.”2°? In particular, it was the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision which
rendered the 2010 TCA Decision final, thereby crystallizing the annulment of the
Concession and related approvals. The Claimant explains that it challenges this
decision, among other measures, because until the release of the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision, no breach of the BIT had occurred.?°>

In any event, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal must hear its claims as it has
pleaded them, not as the Respondent attempts to redefine them. Tribunals have
consistently found that, at the jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal must consider
“presumed or supposed violations of [the Treaty as] invoked by the Claimant.”

In the context of Article XII(3)(d), the “measure that is alleged to be in breach” of the
BIT must be the measure that the Claimant alleges, not the measure as redefined by
the Respondent. Likewise, the “breach” that has been alleged must be assessed as
pleaded by the Claimant. To suggest otherwise would strip the word “alleged” of its
ordinary meaning.*°° The Claimant notes in this respect that the term “alleged” is
being used as a verb, not an adjective, and that, contrary to the Respondent's
suggestion, the term “breach” is often unaccompanied by the qualifier "alleged.”?°°

(iii) Discussion

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant: it is the Claimant’s prerogative to formulate its
claims as it sees fit. As stated in ECE Projektmanagement:

[It is for the investor to allege and formulate its claims of breach of
relevant treaty standards as it sees fit. It is not the place of the
respondent State to recast those claims in a different manner of its own
choosing and the Claimants’ claims accordingly fall to be assessed on
the basis on which they are pleaded.?07

The Tribunal considers that this conclusion is supported by the express language of
Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT, which stipulates that “[a]n investor may submit a dispute as
referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration [...] only if [...] (d) in cases where Costa Rica
is a party to the dispute, no judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court
regarding the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement” (emphasis
added). The Tribunal is persuaded that the ordinary meaning of the term “alleged,”
which is used as a verb in this context, is “pleaded” or “claimed.” Further, at the
jurisdictional stage, a tribunal must be guided by the case as put forward by the
claimant in order to avoid breaching the claimant's due process rights. To proceed
otherwise is to incur the risk of dismissing the case based on arguments not put
forward by the claimant, at a great procedural cost for that party.

Accordingly, the Tribunal must assess the case before it focusing on the measures
that the Claimant has deemed fit to challenge, and determine its jurisdiction, the
admissibility of these claims and, if appropriate, the prima facie existence of rights to
be protected at the merits phase, on that basis. It is a different question whether,
assuming there is jurisdiction and admissibility, the claims as raised are founded or
not. This is a matter for the merits stage where the Claimant will have to establish
that the claims as presented arise from breaches of the BIT and caused a
compensable loss.

The Tribunal notes in this respect that the Claimant asserts that the following
measures breached the BIT:2°

a. The November 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which the Claimant
alleges confirmed the 2010 TCA Decision, “thereby rendering final and
irreversible the annulment of the exploitation concession, environmental
approvals, the declaration of public interest and national convenience, and the
land use change permit.”2°°

b. The June 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which Infinito alleges declined
on preliminary admissibility grounds to resolve the conflict between its earlier
decision upholding the constitutionality of the Las Crucitas Project approvals and
the 2010 TCA Decision.?"°

c. The January 2012 MINAE Resolution, which Infinito alleges cancelled the 2008
Concession and expunged all of Industrias Infinito’s mining rights from the mining
registry, going further than what was ordered by the Administrative Chamber.?"!

d. The 2011 Legislative Moratorium on open-pit mining, which the Claimant alleges
replaced the 2010 Executive Moratorium, prohibiting Industrias Infinito from
applying for new permits.?"2

The Tribunal will now focus its analysis on these measures.

b. Are the Acts Challenged by the Claimant “measures” for Purposes of the
BIT?

(i) | The Respondent's Position
The Respondent denies that judicial measures can be considered “measures”
capable of breaching the BIT. For this reason, it contends that the Claimant cannot
challenge the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, nor the 2013 Constitutional
Chamber Decision (nor, for that matter, the 2010 TCA Decision, which according to
the Respondent is the “real” measure at issue).

C-CM Jur., § 56. Although in its Memorial on the Merits the Claimant also challenged a fifth
measure, the 2015 TCA Damages Decision, the Claimant has withdrawn its challenge to that
decision “because the government and SINAC appealed it to the Administrative Chamber in
December 2015” and “fas a result, the decision is not final or binding on Industrias Infinito.”
However, the Claimant “reserves its right to challenge as an ancillary measure any future
Administrative Chamber decision that breaches the BIT.” C-CM Jur., § 44.

194.

The Respondent argues that the term “measure” is specifically defined in the BIT,
which is unusual. The definition includes “any law, regulation, procedure,
requirement or practice,” with no reference to judgments.?"* It is thus “irrelevant that
the term ‘measure’ is normally understood to include judgments, because the Parties
have adopted a special and narrower definition that must be given effect.”*"* The
Claimant's position is incoherent in this respect: while it acknowledges that the BIT
contains a special definition of the term “measure,” it then proceeds to ignore that
definition, asserting that the term is generally understood to encompass judicial
measures.?'>

Even if the BIT’s definition of “measure” should be read to include judicial measures,
it does not follow that judicial breaches must be arbitrable. According to the
Respondent, ‘[i]t is quite common for investment treaties to provide protection against
a wide range of breaches, but to restrict international dispute resolution concerning
such measures to a narrower subset.”216

Finally, as noted in paragraph 264 infra, the Respondent submits that this
interpretation of the term “measure” is consistent with its interpretation that
Article XII(3)(d) excludes challenges to decisions by Costa Rica’s judiciary.

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant asserts that judicial measures constitute “measures” for the purposes of
the BIT. It notes that, according to Article I(i) of the BIT, a “measure” includes “any
law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice,” which encompasses judicial
decisions and processes, as recognized by the ILC Articles on State Responsibility
and by international tribunals.2'7 While the ordinary meaning of a term may be
supplanted by a special agreed meaning, the party invoking a special meaning must
meet a high burden of proof, which the Respondent has failed to meet.?"® To the
contrary, the list in Article I(i) of the BIT is non-exhaustive (as evidenced by the use of

the word “includes”) and already encompasses judicial measures (which are included
in the categories of law, procedure, requirement and practice).?'°

As discussed in Section IV.C.4.a(ii) infra, the Claimant further submits that this is
consistent with its interpretation of Article XII(3)(d). As noted in that section, judicial
measures may be challenged under the BIT if they are final and not subject to further
appeal. This interpretation is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the provision in
its context and in light of the object and purpose of the BIT. By contrast, Costa Rica’s
interpretation of Article XII(3)(d), would also exclude any challenge to a judicial
measure, even if the claim is for denial of justice or expropriation.?”°

(iii) Discussion

There is no dispute that two of the measures challenged by the Claimant constitute
“measures” for the purposes of the BIT, namely, the 2012 MINAE Resolution and the
2011 Legislative Moratorium. The question arises with respect to the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision,
which are judicial decisions. The Claimant asserts that judicial measures qualify as
“measures” for the purposes of the BIT, while the Respondent denies this.

The Tribunal considers that judicial decisions are indeed “measures” for the purposes
of the BIT. First, it notes that the definition of “measure” in Article (i) of the BIT is
very wide and non-exhaustive. It includes “any [...] procedure,” which in the
Tribunal’s view encompasses judicial procedures and, by necessary implication,
judicial decisions, which are the ultimate goal of any judicial procedure and thus an
inherent part of them. The Tribunal also notes that this same definition has been
used in other treaties such as NAFTA" and CAFTA,” and tribunals have invariably
concluded that it covered judicial measures.?°

Second, the ILC Articles on State Responsibility consider that the acts of the State
organs exercising judicial functions constitute acts of State which may give rise to the
international responsibility of the State.?*

Finally, as explained in Section IV.C.4.a(iii) infra in the context of Article XII(3)(d), the
Tribunal considers that including judicial decisions in the concept of “measure” is
consistent with the context of that provision and with the object and purpose of the
BIT.

Accordingly, all of the measures that the Claimant alleges are in breach of the BIT
can be considered “measures” for purposes of Articles XII(1), XII(2) and XII(3)(d) of
the BIT.

c. Are the Claimant’s Claims Genuine Claims under the BIT, or Do They
Amount to a Disagreement with Costa Rican Courts on Matters of
Domestic Law?

(i) | The Respondent's Position

The Respondent contends that the Claimant's claims are not genuine claims under
the BIT; they merely express a disagreement with Costa Rican courts on matters of
domestic law. Citing international commentary and jurisprudence, it is submitted that
the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae to act as a court of appeal on matters
of domestic law.”° The Tribunal is simply not competent to “second-guess [a local]
court's interpretation and application of local law.” The Respondent refers in
particular to the following comment from the Helnan tribunal :

An ICSID Tribunal will not act as an instance to review matters of
domestic law in the manner of a court of higher instance. Instead, the
Tribunal will accept the findings of local courts as long as no deficiencies,

in procedure or substance, are shown in regard to the local proceedings
which are of a nature of rendering these deficiencies unacceptable from
the viewpoint of international law, such as in the case of a denial of
justice.?27

The Respondent acknowledges that the Claimant alleges several breaches of BIT
provisions. However, it contends that the Claimant “cannot manufacture international
jurisdiction simply by labelling its disagreement with domestic court judgments as
breaches of the BIT.”8 This is confirmed by the Azinian**? and Iberdrola®*°
decisions. The Claimant makes no effort to explain why the TCA’s and Administrative
Chamber's decisions amount to a breach of any provision of the BIT.

Instead, the Claimant’s case is nothing more than “a complaint that the Costa Rican
administrative courts (i.e. the TCA and the Administrative Chamber) disagreed with
the Claimant’s understanding of domestic law, including its understanding of earlier
judgments of the Constitutional Chamber.”*3* According to the Respondent, the
“Claimant's arguments in this arbitration are based on assertions about Costa Rican
law that the Costa Rican courts have expressly and repeatedly rejected.”*°° The
Claimant even fails to acknowledge the reasoning provided by the Costa Rican
courts. For instance, it ignores that the different chambers of the Supreme Court
confirmed that there was no conflict between the allegedly conflicting judgments
invoked by the Claimant.?** Nor has the Claimant challenged the independence or
good faith of the Costa Rican courts.?%

The Respondent maintains that the Claimant has failed to explain how its claims,
even if accepted at face value, reflect a violation of international, rather than domestic
law.”° Despite the Claimant's efforts to focus on the effect of the challenged
measures, “it remains patently clear that the only real question Claimant is asking this
Tribunal to resolve is whether the Costa Rican judiciary erred in its determinations on
issues of Costa Rican law.”*” In particular, it requests the Tribunal to find that Costa
Rican courts incorrectly applied the 2002 Moratorium to Industrias Infinito’s 2008
Concession and other permits. For the Respondent, the “[mJere misapplication of
domestic law, even if proven, is insufficient to establish a breach of international law,
yet Claimant does not contend (or present any evidence to suggest) that Costa Rica’s
courts and administrative authorities did anything more than apply the law as they
understood it in good faith.”*°

Unless the Tribunal is able to assume Costa Rican appellate jurisdiction and accept
that the TCA’s rulings (as upheld by the Administrative Chamber) were incorrect as a
matter of Costa Rican law, the Claimant’s case concerning the annulment of the 2008
Concession fails:9°

a. The arbitrariness claim fails in the face of correct (or even good-faith) application
of domestic law.

b. The legitimate expectations claim fails because the expectation of engaging in an
activity cannot be legitimate if it is illegal under domestic law.

c. The expropriation claim fails because no wrongful taking can result from the
legitimate application of Costa Rica’s legal system.

The Respondent further contends that none of the Claimant's remaining claims
(specifically, its denial of justice claim and its claims against the 2012 MINAE
Resolution and the 2011 Legislative Moratorium) is supported by any evidence that
withstands prima facie scrutiny, and therefore fail on that basis.?4°

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant denies that there is any merit to the Respondent's contention that
Infinito’s BIT claims amount to “labelling” and are not genuine. The arguments that
the Respondent makes under this heading are essentially the same as those
advanced in its objection that the Claimant has not made a prima facie case of
breaches of the BIT. As explained in Section IV.C.3.d(ii) infra, the Claimant asserts

R-Reply Jur., § 145.

R-Reply Jur., {§ 149-150.

that it “has established both on a balance of probabilities and on a prima facie basis
that the various measures which it challenges breached the BIT.”*41

The Claimant further submits that the cases cited by the Respondent to support the
proposition that this Tribunal is not a court of appeal on issues of Costa Rican law are
inapposite. The Claimant “does not contest [...] that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is
limited to determining whether the four administrative and judicial measures at issue
constitute breaches of the Canada—Costa Rica BIT (i.e. breaches of international,
rather than domestic, law).”*4? Most of its claims do not depend on whether the Costa
Rican courts correctly applied Costa Rican law, and for the one claim in which Infinito
does challenge the application of Costa Rican law by local courts, such challenge is
validly brought under the BIT.*° For those claims in which Costa Rican law is
relevant, the Tribunal may consider the correctness with which Costa Rican law was
applied as part of its analysis of whether the Respondent has breached the BIT: the
question for this Tribunal is “not whether Costa Rican domestic law was misapplied,
but whether the failure to correctly apply domestic law in addition to other relevant
facts constitutes a breach of the BIT.”*4* In this context, the application of domestic
law forms part of the Tribunal’s factual analysis.2°

More specifically, the Claimant submits that:

a. Neither the legitimate expectations nor the expropriation claim depend on
whether Costa Rican courts correctly applied Costa Rican law (in particular, the
2002 Moratorium). Although the Respondent relies on its domestic law as a
defense, it is well-established that a State cannot rely on its internal law to justify
an internationally wrongful act.

b. The procedural denial of justice claim, the claim for breach of FET because the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was arbitrary, and the full protection and
security claim are based on expert evidence that the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision conflicted with binding decisions of the Constitutional
Chamber. As explained in paragraph 163 supra, the Claimant asserts that there
is no mechanism available in Costa Rica to resolve that conflict. While the
Administrative Chamber considered that there was no conflict, under Costa Rican
law only the Constitutional Chamber is empowered to make that decision, but
there is no mechanism allowing it to do so.

c. The substantive denial of justice claim is the only claim which implies that the
Tribunal find that the Administrative Chamber incorrectly applied Costa Rican law

by applying the 2002 Moratorium to Industrias Infinito’s 2008 Concession and
other project approvals. The Claimant submits that, “in the context of a
substantive denial of justice claim, the Tribunal has the power to determine
whether the Administrative Chamber's failure to properly apply Costa Rican law
also amounts to breaches of the BIT.”*4” Citing Dolzer and Schreuer, the
Claimant submits that the Tribunal is not bound by the findings of the
Administrative Chamber in deciding whether its decision was arbitrary, or whether
Infinito was denied justice or legal security.“* The Claimant accepts that the task
of applying and interpreting domestic law lies primarily with the courts of the host
country, but this is not exclusively so: where domestic law is applied in a manner
that is evidently arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic, or in breach of a fundamental
right, international liability arises.2“° Citing Chevron, the Claimant further
contends that “the defectiveness of internal law, the refusal to apply it, or its
wrongful application by judges [can] constitute elements of proof of a denial of
justice, in the international understanding of the expression.”°°

In sum, “[w]hether or not certain of Infinito’s claims depend on a finding that Costa
Rican law was applied incorrectly, Infinito’s claims are all grounded in breaches of the
BIT.”251

(iii) Discussion

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione materiae under
the BIT, because the claims amount to no more than a disagreement with the Costa
Rican courts on matters of domestic law. The Claimant contests this, arguing that
Infinito’s claims are all grounded on breaches of the BIT. It also submits that whether
or not Costa Rican law was applied incorrectly is part of the factual analysis which the
Tribunal must carry out in respect of certain BIT breaches.

The Tribunals jurisdiction ratione materiae is defined by Article XII(1) of the BIT (read
in conjunction with Article XII(2)). Accordingly, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction extends to
“[a]ny dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting
Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the
former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has
incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.” This provision

clearly sets out that the Tribunal’s subject-matter jurisdiction extends to disputes
relating to claims that (i) a measure taken or not taken by the host State is in breach
of the BIT, and that (ii) the investor has incurred loss or damage as a result of that
breach.

In the Tribunal’s view, for jurisdictional purposes, it suffices to establish the existence
of (i) a claim that a measure breaches the BIT, and of (ii) a claim that such breach has
caused the investor loss or damage.

With respect to (i), the Tribunal has already found that it must focus on the claim as
pleaded by the Claimant. Here, the Claimant is clearly and unequivocally arguing that
the four measures identified at paragraph 188 supra have breached several of the
Respondent's obligations under the BIT, namely its obligations under Article II(a) (fair
and equitable treatment or the CIL minimum standard), Article II(b) (full protection and
security), and Article VIII (expropriation). The jurisdictional requirement under (i) is
thus met.

With respect to (ii), it is also undisputed that the Claimant claims that the breaches
identified above have caused it loss or damage. The Tribunal thus finds that this
jurisdictional requirement is also met.

The Respondent also objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the grounds that the
Claimant has neither made a prima facie case of the breaches it alleges, nor of the
damage it claims arose from these breaches. The Tribunal addresses these
objections in Sections IV.C.3.d and IV.C.3.e infra.

This does not mean that the Tribunal will not consider the Respondent's argument
that the claims merely represent a disagreement with Costa Rican courts on domestic
law. The Tribunal agrees that it is not its role to act as a court of appeal with respect
to decisions of domestic courts. That said, it is the Tribunals duty to verify if the
measures complained of have breached the BIT. The Tribunal notes in this respect
that only two of the measures complained of are judicial measures (the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision).
As such, the Respondent’s argument can only apply to these two measures.
However, the Claimant has expressly brought claims of denial of justice against those
measures. Whether these claims are well-founded (in particular, whether they go
beyond a mere disagreement between the Claimant and Costa Rican courts on the
application of municipal law) is a matter for the merits.

d. —_Has the Claimant Made a Prima Facie Case of Any of the Alleged Breaches
of the BIT?

(i) | The Respondent's Position
The Respondent submits that, to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Claimant

must make a prima facie case that the conduct of which it complains is capable of
breaching the BIT. For the Respondent, the appropriate analysis in the face of a

65

219.

220.

221.

222.

preliminary objection to jurisdiction was articulated by Judge Higgins in the Oil
Platforms case, according to which the tribunal must “accept pro tem the facts as
alleged by [the claimant] to be true and in that light to interpret [the applicable treaty]
for jurisdictional purposes — that is to say, to see if on the basis of the claims of fact
there could occur a violation of one or more of [the treaty provisions].”*°* In other
words, the test is to assess whether, on the facts alleged by the Claimant, the
challenged acts are capable of violating the BIT.

According to the Respondent, the Claimant “cannot meet the prima facie test by
simply labelling the disputed conduct as a treaty breach.”*°° Citing Impregilo and
Burlington, the Tribunal cannot limit itself to the Claimant's characterization of the
case.?%4

The Respondent further contends that a prima facie case must be supported with
prima facie evidence. While that evidence need not be sufficient to show that the
claim is well founded, it must at least demonstrate that there is some truth behind a
claimant's allegations. In addition, such prima facie evidence need not be accepted
pro tem if the respondent submits other evidence that conclusively contradicts the
claimant's assertions. Citing Chevron |, the Respondent argues that, if from the
evidence submitted in the jurisdictional phase “the Tribunal finds that facts alleged by
the Claimant[] are shown to be false or insufficient to satisfy the prima facie test,
jurisdiction would have to be denied.”°5

The Respondent argues that here, the Claimant has failed to make a prima facie
showing of any of the breaches of the BIT that it alleges. According to the
Respondent, the conduct that the Claimant attributes to Costa Rica, even if it were
proven, would not violate the relevant standards, and in those cases in which the
Claimant’s assertions could plausibly give rise to a breach of the BIT, those
allegations find no support in the evidentiary record.

In response to the Claimant's arguments, the Respondent denies that the Tribunal
must accept the Claimant’s factual and legal allegations as true on their face.
According to the Respondent, “the Tribunal’s role at the jurisdictional stage is to
determine, based on its own review of the available evidence, whether the relevant

State conduct could be deemed to constitute a substantive breach of the BIT within
Costa Rica’s consent to arbitration under Article XII.”25”

Relying on Emmis, the Respondent submits that a tribunal must engage in two
distinct types of inquiries at the jurisdictional stage, each having a different level of
inquiry. The first type of inquiry “relates to questions of fact that must be definitively
determined at the jurisdictional stage,” while “[t]he second involves questions of fact
that go to the merits, which the Tribunal must ordinarily not prejudge, unless they are
plainly without foundation.”*® The second inquiry “necessarily involves assessing
whether the alleged conduct of the [rjespondent is capable of constituting a breach of
the substantive protections of the investment treaty so as to fall within the jurisdiction
of the [t]ribunal ratione materiae but this has to be determined on a prima facie basis
only.”*5° According to the Respondent, the Claimant attempts to conflate these two
inquiries, and mistakenly argues that it must only make a prima facie showing with
respect to both jurisdictional and merits inquiries.?°

On this basis, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal may conclusively determine
issues of fact and law at the jurisdictional stage. In particular, it must determine
decisively those issues that are essential to establish jurisdiction, such as the
existence or ownership of an investment, or threshold requirements of the BIT or the
ICSID Convention.?6' Citing Ampal-American, the Respondent submits that it is “not
only appropriate, but necessary, for the Tribunal to hold Claimant to a higher level of
proof than a prima facie showing for all issues bearing directly on the question of
jurisdiction.” For the Respondent, “[t]his means that the Tribunal does not have to
take Infinito’s assertions or evidence at face value;” it “should test the Claimant's
characterizations and its evidence in order to make its jurisdictional
determinations.”?®

According to the Respondent, “the same is true for determining issues of law relevant
to the jurisdictional inquiry." Citing Achmea, the Respondent contends that the
Tribunal is entitled to engage in a preliminary interpretation of the substantive
provisions of the BIT for purposes of jurisdiction, especially when the parties disagree

on the proper interpretation of a provision.?° Relying on EnCana and Continental
Casualty, the Respondent submits that “it is proper for an arbitral tribunal to identify
the relevant State acts or omissions that make up the alleged treaty breach, and to
examine the facts of the dispute critically.”°° For this purpose, “{a] tribunal is
empowered to look beyond the superficial assertions of a pleading and examine the
true substance of a claimant's complaint, and may arrive at contrary conclusions of
fact or law where the claimant's assertions are demonstrably false, or where claimant
ascribes to them a strained interpretation.”?°”

For the Respondent, the cases cited by the Claimant are inapposite. ECE
Projektmanagement dealt with the attempt of the respondent State to recast a claim
for violation of the FET standard as a claim for denial of justice; here Costa Rica is not
attempting to change the Claimant's legal theory, it “is simply pointing out that the
factual predicate of a particular claim (as defined by Claimant) must have a
sufficiently compelling evidentiary foundation.”?6* In Glamis, the earlier measures that
the respondent claimed would have been time-barred did not have the same impact
as the later measures alleged by the claimant, which is the case here.7©° In Pope &
Talbot, the tribunal agreed with the claimant that the critical date for purposes of the
relevant statute of limitations should be counted as of the date of a later event, but it
did so only after assessing the relevant evidence.?”” In the Phosphates case, the
PClJ refused to accept Italy’s characterization of its claim as one of denial of justice
arising out of the French authorities’ refusal to redress a previous dispossession of an
Italian national, and recognized that the claim was directed at the dispossession itself,
which was time-barred.?”'

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant submits that the prima facie test applicable at the jurisdictional stage is
a low one: “Infinito need only establish that if the facts it alleges are ultimately

established, those facts could constitute a violation of the BIT;” it “need not
demonstrate that such facts, if proven, would violate the BIT.”2”2

The Claimant argues that the Respondent improperly tries to force the Tribunal to
determine at the jurisdictional stage questions that belong to the merits. The
Claimant emphasizes that the Tribunal’s current task is to determine whether it has
jurisdiction, but it must refrain from prejudging the merits.2”°

In particular, the Respondent is inappropriately requesting the Tribunal to engage ina
detailed legal interpretation of the substantive provisions of the BIT, including (i) the
scope of the FET protection in Article Il, (ii) whether Infinito’s legitimate expectations
are relevant to determining whether that standard has been breached, and (iii)
whether judicial decisions can only violate the BIT if they amount to a denial of justice.
The jurisdictional stage is not the place for this analysis.2”* According to the
Claimant, “[t]he Tribunal need simply be satisfied that the claims, as formulated by the
claimant, could fall under the scope of the substantive BIT provisions the claimant
invokes;” “[o]nly where a substantive protection is ‘plainly incapable’ of bearing the
claim put forth by the claimant will it be appropriate for that claim to be dismissed on a
prima facie basis.”*”> Citing Chevron |, the Claimant argues that, at the jurisdictional
stage, “[t]o require a claimant to prove its interpretation of substantive BIT provisions
is to ‘prejudge the merits of the dispute.”?”°

Likewise, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal must accept the Claimant's evidence
on its face. It must not assess the weight of the fact and expert evidence put forward
by the Claimant.2”” The Respondent has acknowledged that “the Tribunal must
‘accept pro tem the facts as alleged’ by the Claimant ‘to be true.”2”° Citing the Oi!
Platforms case, the Claimant argues that ‘[i]t is only at the merits stage that a tribunal
‘has jurisdiction to determine exactly what the facts are and see whether they do
sustain a violation’ of the BIT.”?”? The Respondent's reliance on Chevron | and II is
misplaced: in Chevron |, the tribunal was dealing with a situation where there was
conflicting evidence that could have demonstrated that the facts alleged by the

Claimant were false,7°° and in Chevron Il, the tribunal addressed the possibility that
the facts pleaded in the Notice of Arbitration (not the evidence submitted by the
claimant) would not be accepted as true if they were “incredible, frivolous, vexatious
or otherwise advanced by the claimant in bad faith.”?' Here, the Respondent has not
identified a single piece of evidence adduced by Infinito that should not be accepted
on its face on the basis of the situations contemplated in the Chevron cases.”°

In answer to the Respondent’s arguments on the appropriate standard of review for
the jurisdictional stage, the Claimant articulates the following principles: 7

a. The facts and law that are necessary to determine jurisdiction may be assessed
rigorously. At the jurisdictional stage, tribunals may definitively determine
questions of fact that relate to jurisdiction, such as whether there was an
investment, or an investor, but these questions do not arise in this case. The
cases on which the Respondent relies all relate to this type of inquiry.

b. By contrast, the facts and law that are relevant to the merits must be considered
on a prima facie standard. The Tribunal must accept the Claimant's factual
allegations relating to the merits unless they are plainly without foundation. The
Respondent cannot cite a single arbitral decision where the tribunal engaged, at
the jurisdictional stage, in a detailed review of the factual evidence to determine
whether a substantive BIT standard had been breached. Nor is it appropriate for
the Tribunal to engage in a detailed analysis of the BIT’s substantive provisions
at this stage.

c. The Tribunal’s analysis should be based on the Claimant's allegations, not on the
Respondent's reformulation of the case. The Claimant submits that “Infinito is
free to plead its claims as it deems appropriate,” and “is entitled to provide facts
and legal theory in support of its arguments. In response, Costa Rica is entitled
to provide its own facts and legal theory. The Tribunal then considers both sides’
positions, in light of the allegations made by the claimant. The claimant's facts
and argument are not shielded from arbitral review; but the Tribunal’s analysis
must be based on the claimant's case, not the respondent's recasting of it.”®

In any event, the Claimant contends that not only has it satisfied the low prima facie
standard applicable at the jurisdictional stage; it has also shown that Costa Rica has
breached its obligations under the Articles Il, VIII, and IV of the BIT on the standard
applicable to the Tribunal’s assessment of the merits, i.e., the balance of probabilities
standard.

(iii) Discussion

Both Parties appear to agree that, at the jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal must
engage in two separate inquiries, each of which entail a different standard of review.
As noted in Emmis (on which both Parties rely),°° the first inquiry refers to facts that
go to jurisdiction. The second inquiry involves the merits of the breaches claimed.

The Parties appear to differ on the identification of the facts that fall within the ambit
of the first inquiry. For the Tribunal, it is clear that all the facts that underlie the
jurisdictional requirements set by the ICSID Convention and the BIT must be
established — proven — at the jurisdictional stage. If these facts are not established,
the Tribunal must dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.

Thus, the Tribunal must finally assess whether the facts that prove the following
requirements are established:26°

i. Whether there is a legal dispute (Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and
Article XII(1) of the BIT).

ii. Whether that dispute arises directly out of an investment (Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention).

iii. Whether that investment qualifies as such under Article I(g) of the BIT,
including whether it is owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rican
Law (Article I(g) of the BIT in connection with Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and Article XII(1) of the BIT).

iv. Whether the Parties qualify as a Contracting State (or any constituent
subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that
State); and an “investor” of another Contracting State (Article 25 ICSID of the
ICSID Convention, and Article XII(1) of the BIT).

v. Whether the Parties have consented in writing to ICSID arbitration (Article
25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and Article XII(3)(a) of the BIT).

vi. Whether the dispute relates to a claim that a measure breaches the BIT
(Article XII(1) of the BIT).
vii. Whether the dispute relates to a claim that the investor has incurred a loss or

damage (Article XII(1) of the BIT).

Exh. RL-0086, Emmis, § 172.

As noted supra, § 174 and explained further infra, 343, the Tribunal will determine whether
the requirement set out under Article XII(3)(c) is jurisdictional in nature at the merits stage; and
it considers that the issue whether the requirement in Article XII(3)(d) is jurisdictional or
admissibility is of no consequence in light of the Tribunal’s finding in Section IV.C.4.a(iii) infra.

71

236.

237.

238.

viii. Whether a period of six months has elapsed since the notice of dispute and
the Parties have attempted to settle the dispute amicably (Article XII(2) of the
BIT).

ix. Whether the Claimant has waived its right to other proceedings in relation to
the measures (Article XII(3)(b) of the BIT).

x. Whether more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the
Claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the
alleged breach and knowledge that it had incurred loss or damage
(Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT).

xi. Whether a judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding
the measure that is alleged to be in breach of the BIT (Article XII(3)(d) of the

BIT).

As noted in Sections IV.B and IV.C.2 supra, the Parties agree that the jurisdictional
requirements listed above in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii), (iv), (viii) and (ix) are met. The
Parties also agree that the requirement listed at sub-paragraph (iii) (existence of an
investment protected under the BIT) is met, but given APREFLOFAS’s argument that
the investment was not obtained in accordance with Costa Rican law, the Tribunal
has deferred this issue to the merits. The Parties dispute whether the remaining
requirements have been met. The Tribunal has already found that those in sub-
paragraphs (vi) and (vii) are present, i.e. an alleged claim which relates to a breach
of the BIT and which relates to an alleged loss caused by the alleged breach. As for
consent (requirement (v)), the Parties diverge on requirements (x) and (xi), which the
Tribunal addresses in Sections IV.C.4.a and IV.C.4.b infra. The analysis of these
latter requirements will complete the first inquiry under the Emmis standard, i.e. the
inquiry referring to facts going to jurisdiction or admissibility.

The Tribunal must next engage in the second inquiry, which is to assess prima facie
whether the claims asserted may constitute treaty breaches. For the Tribunal, this is
equivalent to the pro tem test articulated by Judge Higgins in the Oil Platforms case.
Accordingly, to determine whether the claims are “sufficiently plausibly based” upon
the applicable treaty, the appropriate analysis “is to accept pro tem the facts as
alleged by [the claimant] to be true and in that light to interpret [the applicable treaty]
for jurisdictional purposes — that is to say, to see if on the basis of [the claimant's]
claims of fact there could occur a violation of one or more [provisions of the treaty].”2°”

In making this prima facie determination, the Tribunal must first assume the facts as
the Claimant alleges them. Pro tem — pro tempore, that is for the time being — the
Tribunal must accept that the facts alleged will later be proven. Second, the Tribunal
must review whether the facts alleged are susceptible of constituting breaches of the
treaty’s guarantees of protections as it understands these guarantees. To this
second inquiry, the Tribunal must apply a prima facie standard of review, both in

Exh. RL-0085, Oi! Platforms, § 32.

72

240.

241.

respect of the capacity of the facts to fall within the ambit of the treaty protections and
of the understanding of these protections.

The Tribunal is neither required nor entitled to engage in a review exceeding the
prima facie standard. The Emmis tribunal expressly recognized this, when it stated
that the second inquiry “necessarily involves assessing whether the alleged conduct
of the [rjespondent is capable of constituting a breach of the substantive protections
of the investment treaty so as to fall within the jurisdiction of the [t]ribunal ratione
materiae but this has to be determined on a prima facie basis only.”* Similarly, the
Abaciat tribunal restated the pro tem test as follows:

[T]he task of the Tribunal at the stage of determining whether it has
jurisdiction to hear a claim under an investment treaty merely consists in
determining whether the facts alleged by the claimant(s), if established,
are capable of constituting a breach of the provisions of the BIT which
have been invoked [...]._ In performing this task, the Tribunal applies a
prima facie standard, both to the determination of the meaning and scope
of the relevant BIT provisions invoked as well as to the assessment of
whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches of these provisions on
its face.26°

As a result, the Tribunal will not engage now in a detailed analysis of the facts alleged
or of the substantive provisions of the BIT. As noted by Judge Higgins in her
separate opinion in the Oil Platforms case, it is for the merits “to determine what
exactly the facts are, whether as finally determined they do sustain a violation of [the
treaty provisions]; and if so, whether there is a defence to that violation [...]. In short,
it is at the merits that one sees ‘whether there really has been a breach.””°°

The Tribunal is of the view that it is essential to clearly distinguish the limited prima
facie review at the jurisdictional level from the full-fledged review that will be
undertaken at the merits stage. Going beyond a prima facie test at such an incipient
stage of the proceedings creates a risk of breach of due process. In bifurcated
proceedings, the disputing parties expect that the merits will be tried in the
subsequent phase of the arbitration and do not put before the tribunal at the
jurisdictional stage the entire spectrum of evidence and argument that is reserved for
the merits. As a result, if the Tribunal delves too deeply into the merits at the
jurisdictional stage, without having the benefit of a complete record and full
submissions, the Parties can be deprived of the opportunity to fully present and
defend their case, as required by fundamental principles of procedure. Moreover,
exceeding the strict bounds of the pro tem or prima facie test imperils the
manageability and efficiency of the proceedings. Applying an expansive test, such as
the one put forward by the Respondent, could result in trying the case twice whenever
the Tribunal upholds jurisdiction, thus resulting in unnecessary costs and delays.

This being so, while noting that at the jurisdictional stage one should not prejudge
facts that go to the merits, the Tribunal considers that an exception needs to be made
when these facts are “plainly without foundation.”*' This is not the case here. With a
few minor exceptions, the Parties agree on the main facts, in particular on the
existence of the measures alleged by the Claimant. What they do disagree on is the
legal characterization and impact of these facts and whether they amount to breaches
of the BIT. However, these are all properly issues for the merits. In the absence of
manifestly false factual allegations, the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the
pro tem test.

On the basis of these principles, the Tribunal has no hesitation concluding that the
pro tem or prima facie test is met. For the purposes of jurisdiction, and on a prima
facie basis only, the Tribunal holds that the facts alleged could potentially amount to a
treaty breach. Whether such a breach, would actually constitute an unlawful
expropriation, a breach of FET or of the customary international law minimum
standard of treatment, or a denial of justice, is a determination that exceeds the ambit
of the present inquiry and belongs to the merits analysis. Moreover, the Tribunal
notes that the Claimant challenges non-judicial measures, which on a prima facie
basis may also potentially constitute treaty breaches.

On the basis of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal holds that the Claimant has
satisfied the prima facie test needed to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione
materiae. In other words, it has shown that the facts which it alleges, if accepted as
true, could entail breaches of the BIT.

e. Must Infinito Make a Prima Facie Case on Damages and, if So, Has It Done
So?

(i) | The Respondent's Position

Articles XII(1) and XII(2) of the BIT provide that an investor may submit to arbitration
“[alny dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting
Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the
former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has
incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach [...].”

According to the Respondent, the BIT conditions a valid claim on the existence of
both (i) a measure alleged to have breached the BIT and (ii) a specification of loss or
damage arising out of the alleged breach. This means that a claimant must establish
a prima facie case for both (i) an alleged breach and (ii) an alleged damage flowing
from such breach. If the claimant does not identify the loss or damage resulting from
the measure, then it fails to state a prima facie claim.”°*

247.

248.

The Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to establish a prima facie case
for both breach and damage. The Respondent’s arguments regarding a prima facie
case on the alleged breach are addressed in Section IV.C.3.d supra. The
Respondent's arguments regarding a prima facie case on damages are reviewed
here.

The Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to present a plausible theory of
loss or damage attributable to any of the measures it has identified as being in breach
of the BITS for the following reasons:

a.

First, the Claimant has asserted that its investment in Costa Rica lost all value as
a result of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision (indeed, on the Claimant's
damages theory, this is the only cause asserted for the Claimant's alleged
damage). However, the Respondent contends that the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision was not the true cause of the Claimant's loss; the true cause
was the 2010 TCA Decision, which annulled the Claimant's 2008 Concession.”

Second, even if the 2010 TCA Decision was not the true cause of the Claimant's
loss, the Claimant has failed to show what specific damage the 2011
Administrative Chamber decision caused to its business. The Claimant's main
argument appears to be that it suffered losses “based on stock valuations, which
fluctuate on a daily basis and are often based on nothing more than a hope or
wishful thinking;” “[b]ut a loss of hope is not a compensable injury for which a
tribunal may award damages in international arbitration.” As to the Claimant's
argument that it continued to spend money on the project in the period between
the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, it is likely
that “such money related to the legal actions it was pursuing at the time, as it was
affirmatively barred from undertaking any development on the project during the
pendency of the cassation request.”2°°

Third, if the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is the true cause of the
Claimant's losses, it is unclear how the Claimant could have “incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of” later measures.”9’ By its own admission,
its losses became final, and its investment in Costa Rica substantially worthless,
with the issuance of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision: “It is logically
impossible for something that has already been lost to be lost again through a
subsequent act.”*°° Citing Pey Casado, the Respondent contends that “a

claimant must prove damages for each relevant act and cannot pretend that its
damages were caused by one act when in fact they were caused by another.”°°

d. Fourth, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium could not have caused the Claimant any
damage because this moratorium did not deprive the Claimant of the possibility to
obtain a new concession, which it had lost before through the 2010 Executive
Moratorium. The Respondent presumes that the Claimant chose not to challenge
those decrees because they are “evidently outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
ratione temporis.”"*' In addition, the 2010 TCA Decision ordered the Las
Crucitas area to be reforested, thus precluding the Claimant's possibility of
obtaining new mining rights.5°* Even if the Claimant could have potentially
sought new mining rights, it has “failed to explain how the vaguely defined hope
to acquire new mining rights could qualify as a genuine /oss under the BIT.”°°

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

Contrary to the Respondent’s suggestion, the Claimant asserts that it has
demonstrated its losses on a balance of probabilities, and thus has more than
established a prima facie case of damages for the purposes of Article XII(1) and
(2).904

According to the Claimant, its losses crystallized on the date of the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision, not on the date of the 2010 TCA Decision. At that
time, the annulment of Industrias Infinito’s 2008 Concession and other project
approvals was rendered complete, final and irreversible under Costa Rican law.°°>
Pending the proceedings before the Administrative Chamber, the 2010 TCA Decision
was contingent, suspended, and capable of being reversed in full.2%°° This is
supported by Costa Rican law, Infinito’s actions, the response of public markets, and
the actions of the Government of Costa Rica. It is also confirmed in the First and
Second Reports of FTI Consulting, who analyzed Infinito’s financial statements,
changes in market capitalization, management actions and public disclosure,
investing activities after the relevant decisions, contemporaneous actions of the Costa
Rican Government, and contemporaneous Costa Rican media statements.°°” The
Claimant notes that Costa Rica has not presented expert evidence to the contrary.

As to the Respondent’s arguments on the value of the evidence submitted by Infinito,
the Claimant contends that “[flor a publicly-traded company, its share price reflects
real value,” and notes that “the price of Infinito’s shares has remained at close to zero
since the Administrative Chamber's decision” and “[t]here is no reason to think it will
recover.”

In any event, the Claimant argues that its evidence must be accepted as true for the
purposes of jurisdictional analysis. When assessing jurisdiction, “the question is
whether the facts alleged, taken to be true, ‘may be capable’ of breaching the BIT’s
protections.” Thus, at this stage, the Tribunal must accept the expert evidence
provided by the Claimant regarding Infinito’s losses and the cause of those losses.°"°
Costa Rica is asking the Tribunal to prejudge the merits and decide now that the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision caused no loss.°'' According to the Claimant, the
only investment tribunal that has declined jurisdiction on this basis (in Telenor) found
that the claimant had failed to establish a prima facie case of expropriation because it
had failed to adduce any fact or expert evidence to prove that its investments had
been rendered substantially worthless.°"2

That is not the case here: the Claimant notes that FTI Consulting, in consultation with
RPA, has calculated Infinito’s losses as of 30 November 2011 (the date of the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision) at USD 321 million, using the discounted cash flow
(‘DCF”) method based on a financial model that concluded that “technical aspects
and assumptions of the Crucitas project were developed using standard industry
practices and were reasonable and well supported,” and that “the capital and
operating cost assumptions of the Crucitas project [...] were reasonable.”*'? RPA has
also concluded that the Las Crucitas Project had value beyond the DCF analysis,
“contained in resource ounces not included in the production schedule, and
prospective exploration ground located on the exploitation concession territory but
outside the development area,” and values these assets at “between US$23.7 million
and US$37.1 million based on comparable transactions for non-producing gold
deposits.”°"4

The Claimant denies that it must establish separate losses from the other measures it
has challenged. These other measures prevent Infinito from obtaining a new
exploitation concession and new project approvals, or from having the existing

concession and approvals restored. As a result, “these measures operated in
combination with the Administrative Chamber's decision to effectively render Infinito’s
investments substantially worthless.”*">

According to the Claimant, in the case of a composite breach, a claimant is not
required to prove separate damages associated with each individual measure.*'° Pey
Casado, cited by the Respondent, is inapposite because it did not address whether
each individual measure must cause separate damages.°'’ Here, the Claimant is
alleging that its losses only crystallized by the combined operation of the four
challenged measures: “absent the other measures that Infinito challenges, the
exploitation concession and other project approvals could have been restored or a
new concession and new approvals could have been granted. Had that occurred,
then the Crucitas project could have continued, and Infinito’s investments would not
have been rendered substantially worthless.”>"°

(iii) Discussion

The Tribunal can dispense with determining whether, under the terms of Article XII(1),
the Claimant must make out a prima facie case on damages in addition to a prima
facie case on breach. Indeed, what matters for the purposes of a possible prima facie
test on damages is that the facts as alleged may constitute a loss. There is no
question that this requirement is met here. What act may constitute a breach, if any,
and whether that act can have caused the damages claimed are different questions,
which exceed the limited scope of the prima facie test and must be dealt with at the
merits stage.

The Respondent’s Objections under Article XII(3)

a. Are the Claimant’s Claims Barred under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT
Because They Challenge Measures Regarding which the Costa Rican
Courts Have Already Rendered Judgment?

(i) | The Respondent's Position

The Respondent highlights the unusual nature of Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT. It first
argues that it is not a “fork-in-the-road” clause: rather than providing investors with a
choice to submit the same dispute either to the courts of the host State or to an
arbitral tribunal, this clause bars any claim against measures “regarding” which a
Costa Rican court has rendered a judgment. Unlike a fork-in-the-road clause, this
provision does not require that the Costa Rican judicial proceedings and the investor-
State proceedings satisfy the triple identity test.°° However, in its later submissions,
it argues that this provision is similar to (but broader than) a fork-in-the-road clause,
although it recognizes that it does not include many of the limitations contained in
such clauses.*°

The Respondent submits that, pursuant to Article 31 of the VCLT, this provision must
be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms in
their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT. With respect to the
ordinary meaning of Article XII(3)(d), the following submissions are made:

a. While the starting point should be the ordinary meaning of the provision, an
ordinary meaning that leads to an illogical result should not be accepted.**' In
addition, where, as here, there are several equally authentic versions of a treaty,
it may be necessary to consider the terms in each of the authentic languages.°2
Further, in accordance with Article 31(4) of the VCLT, the ordinary meaning does
not apply where a special meaning has been agreed by the parties.°°>

b. In accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms, it is “clear that Article
XII(3)(d) constitutes a limitation of arbitral jurisdiction in an investor-State dispute
under the BIT.”

c. All that is required to trigger this bar is a judgment of a Costa Rican court
“regarding” the measure in question. The ordinary meaning of the term
“regarding” is broad and “must be understood to cover a broad range of possible
relationships between the challenged measure and the relevant Costa Rican
judgment,” denoting “a situation in which the measure in question has any type of

259.

genuine connection with the Costa Rican court judgment.” For the
Respondent, the word “regarding” must be equated with “concerning,” “about” or
“related to.”3°° This is consistent with the authentic Spanish version of the
provision, which uses the terms “relativo a la medida’ (i.e., “related” to the
measure), and to the equally authentic French version, which uses the words “au
sujet de la mesure,” which the Respondent translates as “on the subject of” or
“about” the measure.*?”

The Respondent notes that Article XII(3)(d) is asymmetric. It only applies to cases in
which Canadian investors contest measures regarding which a Costa Rican court has
issued a judgment, not cases brought by Costa Rican investors against measures
taken by Canada. This shows that this provision was specifically negotiated with the
Costa Rican judiciary in mind.326

According to the Respondent, “the obvious intended effect of Article XII(3)(d) of the
BIT is to prevent Canadian investors from overriding the judgments of Costa Rican
courts before international arbitral tribunals,” which “is precisely what Claimant
attempts to do in this arbitration."°° As noted above, the Respondent contends that
the Tribunal need not accept the Claimant’s characterization of the measure, and that
the real measure at the heart of the Claimant's case is the 2010 TCA Decision that
annulled Industrias Infinito’s 2008 Concession.**° However, because there are
multiple judgments of the Costa Rican courts “regarding” this annulment, this claim is
barred under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT:

a. The 2010 TCA Decision has been the subject of the judgment of a Costa Rican
court, specifically of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision which ruled on
Industrias Infinito’s cassation request regarding the 2010 TCA Decision.**"

b. The 2010 TCA Decision is, in itself, a judgment rendered by a Costa Rican court
regarding the annulment.°°2

c. The 2010 TCA Decision was also the subject of the 2013 Constitutional Chamber
Decision.3%3

The Respondent contends that a direct challenge to the 2010 TCA Decision is thus
barred by Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT. It is for this reason that, in an attempt to

circumvent this provision, the Claimant formally challenges other measures.
However, this attempt must fail because the claims regarding these measures “rest
almost entirely on the premise that the 2010 TCA Judgment was wrongly decided.”>*

In any event, even if one were to consider that the “measures” formally challenged by
the Claimant are the relevant measures, they are all barred under Article XII(3)(d)
because they are all measures “regarding” which the Costa Rican courts have
rendered a judgment:

a.

The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is in itself a judgment of Costa Rica’s
highest court. According to the Respondent, “it is impossible to identify a
measure more closely related to a Costa Rican court judgment than a judicial
‘measure,’ especially when such measure consists in upholding another Costa
Rican court judgment.” A contrary interpretation “would render the treaty
provision essentially meaningless because it could always be circumvented by
defining the judicial decision (rather than the act regarding which that judgment
was rendered), as the relevant ‘measure.””°>

Likewise, the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision is also a judgment of a
Costa Rican court.°%”

Seen from a different perspective, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision,
the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision and the 2012 MINAE Resolution are
all “measures” related to the 2010 TCA Decision, which is in itself a judgment of a
Costa Rican Court.

The 2010 Executive Moratorium and the 2011 Legislative Moratorium have also
been subject to multiple judgments of the Costa Rican courts. The 2010
Executive Moratorium was comprised of two executive decrees (the Arias
Moratorium Decree and the Chinchilla Moratorium Decree), as well as the 2011
Legislative Moratorium, which all were challenged before the Constitutional
Chamber of the Supreme Court. In each case, the Constitutional Chamber
dismissed the challenge. With respect to the 2011 Legislative Moratorium, the
Constitutional Chamber even considered and rejected claims that it violated the
BIT (the fact that the plaintiff was not Industrias Infinito is irrelevant for present
purposes, because the Article XII(3)(d) does not require that the judgment
regarding the “measure” involve the same parties).°°°

265.

According to the Respondent, all of these judgments are “regarding” the annulment of
the Claimant’s Concession, which is the real measure challenged by the Claimant.*°
As recognized in Methanex, upon which the Claimant relies, the term “regarding”
refers to a legally significant connection. For the Respondent, “[t]here can be no
dispute that the connection between Costa Rican judgments and what Claimant's BIT
claim is about is a legally significant one.”*“" In any event, the Respondent maintains
that it is perfectly possible for a measure to be “regarding,” “concerning” or “related to”
itself.*4? In addition, “in the case of judgments, it is appropriate to distinguish between
the substantive content of the judgment (i.e. the operative part of the decision) and
the form of the ruling (ie. a written judgment),” and “the written judgment is
necessarily ‘regarding’ the substantive content included therein,” being “the
substantive content, not the form, which is ‘alleged to be in breach’ of the BIT.”58

The Respondent also argues that the Claimant’s interpretation has the effect of
excluding from the scope of the Respondent’s exception to consent any challenges
that question the judgment itself. According to the Respondent, “[t]here is no logical
reason why measures that are the subject of a judgment should be excluded from the
scope of the dispute resolution clause, while measures that are themselves
judgments should be covered.”** This interpretation leads to an absurd result and
cannot be accepted.

As noted in Section IV.C.3.b supra, the Respondent also argues that judicial
measures are excluded from the scope of the BIT, which supports Costa Rica’s
interpretation that Article XII(3)(d) excludes challenges to decisions by Costa Rica’s
judiciary.

Contrary to the Claimant's contentions, the Respondent asserts that its interpretation
is consistent with the context of the provision. It is entirely consistent with other
provisions of the BIT and with the fact that it does not contain many of the limitations
typically found in a fork-in-the-road clause.**° By contrast, according to the
Respondent, the Claimant’s arguments on context are incoherent:

a. The Claimant acknowledges that the BIT contains a special definition of the term
“measure,” but then proceeds to ignore that definition, asserting that the term is
generally understood to encompass judicial measures.°*°

b. Even if the BIT’s definition of “measure” should be read to include judicial
decisions, it does not follow that judicial breaches must be arbitrable. According

to the Respondent, ‘[i]t is quite common for investment treaties to provide
protection against a wide range of breaches, but to restrict international dispute
resolution concerning such measures to a narrower subset.”*”

c. The jurisdictional limitation contained in Article XII(3)(d) cannot be inconsistent
with Costa Rica’s “unconditional consent” to arbitration, as the Claimant
suggests, because such “unconditional consent” has been given in accordance
with the provisions of the entirety of Article XII, which includes the carve-out in
Article XII(3)(d).348

d. The fact that Article VIII(1) of the BIT gives investors the opportunity for judicial
review of expropriations in Costa Rica is not inconsistent with Costa Rica’s
interpretation of Article XII(3)(d).° The BIT does not impose a requirement to
exhaust domestic remedies, but if judicial remedies are invoked and result in a
judgment, Article XII(3)(d) precludes an investor from bringing another challenge
by means of international arbitration.

e. Costa Rica’s interpretation is not inconsistent with its substantive obligation to
provide FET, insofar as that obligation must be understood to include an
obligation not to deny justice in domestic courts. The Claimant confuses the
existence of a substantive obligation with the question of which treaty breaches
are subject to arbitration. While Costa Rica agrees in principle that the minimum
standard of treatment under international law includes a protection against denial
of justice, “Article II(2)(a) of the BIT makes no mention of judicial measures or
denial of justice per se, meaning that nothing in the particular wording of the
clause contradicts Costa Rica’s assertion that, under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT,
Costa Rican court judgments are not subject to review through arbitration.”°°°

While the Respondent agrees with the Claimant’ that treaty terms should be
interpreted to ensure that each term has meaning (effet utile), it views the Claimant's
interpretation as lacking effet utile. lt defies common sense to interpret Article
XII(3)(d) as a provision that “encourages (without requiring) pursuit of local remedies,
[...] and shields lower court decisions from arbitral review when a final domestic
decision has been rendered,” as the Claimant contends.*** It is illogical to interpret a
provision that prohibits arbitration where a judgment has been rendered by a Costa
Rican court as encouraging the pursuit of local remedies. The provision clearly
discourages the pursuit of local remedies. In addition, the Claimant’s interpretation
would mean that the exception provided under Article XII(3)(d) would be meaningless

to Costa Rica, as an investor could always circumvent it by not challenging the lower
court decision directly.2°

In any event, the Respondent argues that, even on the Claimant's interpretation,
Article XII(3)(d) would bar a challenge to the 2010 TCA Decision, because the
Claimant does not contest that a final domestic decision has been rendered regarding
that judgment.°54

As to the object and purpose of the treaty, the Respondent disagrees with the
Claimant’s suggestion that Article XII(3)(d) must be interpreted restrictively because
the object and purpose of the BIT is to promote investment. According to Costa Rica,
“[i]nvestment treaties are always intended to promote investment, but this does not
mean that exceptions to a Contracting Party’s consent to arbitration under such
treaties must be read narrowly.” As recognized by multiple courts and tribunals, “a
sovereign State’s expression of consent to arbitration must be unambiguous, and that
consent cannot be implied or expanded simply by reference to the object and purpose
of the treaty.” Indeed, “numerous BITs promote investment without providing any
recourse to investment arbitration at all, or by limiting it in ways that are much more
severe than the limitations imposed by this BIT.”°°”

Nor does Costa Rica’s interpretation unreasonably preclude arbitration, as the
Claimant suggests:

a. The Claimant's argument that, under Costa Rica’s interpretation, the State could
always defeat jurisdiction by launching a challenge of the measure and ensuring
that its courts reject that challenge, “implies the existence of collusion between
administrative authorities and the courts to deny an investor its day in court.”**
In such a scenario, a tribunal may well find that the State is estopped by its own
bad faith conduct from invoking an otherwise valid jurisdictional exception. Here,
however, there is no suggestion that Costa Rica initiated judicial challenges in
bad faith, nor can it be disputed that the Claimant took full advantage of the
Costa Rican court system to defend its Concession.°°°

b. With respect to the Claimant's suggestion that it would be inappropriate to
interpret Article XII(3)(d) as precluding arbitration related to judgments in
proceedings in which the Claimant did not take part, the Respondent argues that
it is for the Tribunal to determine whether the relevant judgment is sufficiently
related to the measure being challenged. Here, however, the Respondent notes
that the Claimant participated in all the key proceedings in this case, with the
exception of those cited by Costa Rica with respect to the 2010 Moratorium. That
said, the Respondent insists that these judgments are sufficiently related to the
challenged measure as to fall within the scope of Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT.

The Respondent notes that its interpretation is not based on the travaux préparatoires
or on other supplementary means of interpretation. It is based on the primary
interpretation rules of Article 31 of the VCLT. The Respondent alleges that the
travaux do not contain much information on the drafting history of Article XII(3)(d),
and that the Claimant's suggestion that it was intended as a compromise on the
exhaustion of local remedies finds no support in the travaux.°*' Even if there had
been a link between the discussions on exhaustion of local remedies and Article
XII(3)(d), it would support Costa Rica’s interpretation, as a provision similar to (but
broader than) a fork-in-the-road clause. The Respondent argues in this respect that
“[a]n exhaustion of remedies requirement, however, is flatly inconsistent with a ‘fork-
in-the-road’ provision, insofar as the first requires and the other prohibits access to
domestic courts before resorting to arbitration;” “[i]t is therefore hardly surprising that,
[...] following the inclusion of Article XII(3)(d), Costa Rica dropped its earlier proposal
to include an exhaustion of remedies requirement.”°?

In any event, the Respondent asserts that the circumstances of the conclusion of the
BIT confirm Costa Rica’s pride in its legal system and its belief that its system was
fully in compliance with international law concerning due process and investor rights.
The Respondent notes in this regard that the memorandum accompanying Costa
Rica’s submission of the BIT for ratification by the legislature concluded that the
“costs of ratifying such BITs were low because they did not provide for a level of
protection beyond that already existing under domestic law.”

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant denies that its claims are barred by Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT. None of
the measures that it challenges in this arbitration have been the subject of a judgment
of a Costa Rican court.%** The Respondent mischaracterizes Infinito’s claims as an
attack against the 2010 TCA Decision, but this is not Infinito’s case.°°> Its case is

that, as a composite whole, the four measures that it challenges “had the combined
effect of stripping Infinito of all of its rights, barring it from seeking any sort of
meaningful remedy, and eliminating any possibility of proceeding with the Crucitas
project.”266

Specifically, the Claimant alleges that:

a.

There is no judgment of a Costa Rican court regarding the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision.**” The Claimant notes that this decision was made by an
appellate court in Costa Rica and is not subject to review by Costa Rican courts.
Indeed, part of Infinito’s claim is based on the lack of availability of judicial
recourse to address the inconsistency created by this decision. As explained
further below, the Claimant denies that this decision is a judgment “regarding”
itself for purposes of Article XII(3)(d). The Claimant also denies that the 2013
Constitutional Chamber Decision was a judgment “regarding” the 2011
Administrative Decision; it was a statement by the Constitutional Chamber that it
was not empowered to render a judgment regarding the 2010 TCA Decision.

There is no judgment regarding the application of the 2011 Legislative
Moratorium to the Las Crucitas Project. The court decisions to which Costa Rica
refers relate to the application of the 2011 Legislative Moratorium and previous
moratorium decrees to other parties and other projects. As explained below,
these decisions do not fall under the scope or Article XII(3)(d).°%

There is no judgment regarding the 2012 MINAE Resolution. Contrary to Costa
Rica’s contention, the 2010 TCA Decision cannot be understood to be a
judgment “regarding” the 2012 MINAE Resolution. While the 2012 MINAE
Resolution may be “regarding” the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision, the reverse is not true. But Article XII(3)(d)
does not “bar challenges to administrative measures that were adopted
subsequently to judgments and that go further than what those judgments
require.”%69

Likewise, there is no judgment regarding the 2013 Constitutional Chamber
Decision. This decision, which dismissed Industrias Infinito’s unconstitutionality
action on admissibility grounds, has never been the subject of any Costa Rican
judgment.2”°

e. Finally, the Claimant contends that there is no judgment regarding the composite
impact of the individual measures.°”!

The Claimant submits that, for a claim to be barred under Article XII(3)(d), two
conditions must be satisfied: (i) there must be a measure alleged by the Claimant to
be in breach of the BIT, and (ii) there must be a judgment regarding that measure.°”
The Claimant interprets these conditions as follows, according to the plain meaning of
the terms of Article XII(3)(d):

a. As discussed in Section IV.C.3.a(ii) supra, the “measure that is alleged to be in
breach” of the BIT must be the measure that the Claimant alleges is in breach of
the BIT, not the measure as redefined by the Respondent. Likewise, the “breach”
that has been alleged must be assessed, at the jurisdictional level, as pleaded by
the Claimant.

b. As discussed in Section IV.C.3.b(ii) supra, the term “measure” includes
judgments.

c. The judgment “regarding” the measure alleged to be in breach must be an act
different from the measure. The term “regarding” denotes a connection between
the relevant measure and the relevant judgment, which in turn requires at least
two discrete entities or acts. To permit the “judgment” to be the same act as the
“measure” would be contrary to the ordinary meaning of the term “regarding.”*”*
As a result, a judgment cannot be “regarding” itself, as the Respondent
maintains.

Accordingly, under the Claimant's interpretation, judicial measures may be challenged
under the BIT, with the following limitations: (i) if a lower court judgment has been
challenged by an appeal, it cannot be challenged; and (ii) if the measure is an
appellate judgment, the investor may only challenge the final measure in the chain of
appeals.° In this manner, “Costa Rican courts have the opportunity to reverse the
harmful effects of lower court judgments on investments, and to remedy breaches of
international law, before a dispute is submitted to arbitration. If the investment is
harmed as a result of the final appellate decision, such that the harm becomes final,
the investor may challenge the last judgment.”°”°

The Claimant adds that, if the investor's investment has been harmed by an
executive, administrative, or legislative measure, the investor may challenge that
measure directly under the BIT. If in turn the measure has been the subject of the

judgment of a Costa Rican court, the investor may challenge that judgment as
described in the preceding paragraph.*”°

According to the Claimant, this interpretation “reflects the BIT drafters’ confidence in
Costa Rica’s judiciary.”*”’ It “facilitates a robust dispute resolution system that
simultaneously respects the independence and sovereignty of the Costa Rican
judiciary.”°7

The Claimant insists that Article XII(3)(d) is not a fork-in-the-road provision. It is not
designed to make investors choose between domestic and international remedies;
rather, it encourages, but does not require, the exhaustion of local remedies.°”

The Claimant submits that its interpretation is consistent with the interpretive
principles of Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT:

a. As explained above, it is consistent with the plain meaning of the terms “alleged
to be in breach” and “regarding.”*°°

b. It is consistent with the BIT as a whole in light of its context. As explained further
below, there is no support in the context of Article XII(3)(d) for the exclusion of
judicial measures, or requiring only a tenuous connection between the “judgment”
and the “measure.” Likewise, the Claimant argues that its interpretation is
consistent with the remainder of the BIT’s provisions.°*"

c. It is in line with the object and purpose of the BIT, which for the Claimant is the
promotion and protection of investments, as stated in the BIT’s Preamble.%®2
Citing Aguas del Tunari, the Claimant submits that “[t]he ‘primary objective’ of the
BIT is to create the framework, and to select [...] ‘an independent and neutral
forum for the resolution of investment disputes in accordance with a substantive
applicable law’.”*° Its interpretation is further in conformity with the treaty’s
object and purpose, because it “preserves investors’ rights to submit to
international arbitration claims that substantive provisions of the BIT [...] have
been breached.”

281.

d. Its interpretation facilitates the fulfillment of the object and purpose of the BIT by
allowing investors to pursue, without requiring them to exhaust, domestic
remedies. The Claimant notes that the “exhaustion of local remedies is often
considered a requirement for an investor to establish that it has experienced a
denial of justice at the hands of the host state.”*°> With respect to other claims, it
submits that “the pursuit of local remedies is widely accepted as a desirable, if
not necessary, pre-requisite to arbitration, even in the absence of an explicit
exhaustion of local remedies requirement in the relevant BIT.” — Citing
Generation Ukraine, Apotex and Loewen, the Claimant submits that “[t]o qualify
as a final ‘measure’ under the BIT, an investor must make at least a reasonable
effort to obtain local redress.”*°”

e. Finally, the Claimant's interpretation is supported by the available supplementary
interpretative aids under Article 32 of the VLCT, in particular, by the BIT’s travaux
préparatoires. The negotiating history of the BIT shows that Costa Rica
attempted to introduce an exhaustion of local remedies requirement, but Canada
did not accept it. Instead, the parties reached a compromise, reflected in Article
XII(3)(d), which encouraged the use of local remedies.** Only Infinito’s
interpretation of this provision can be reconciled with this intended purpose.*®°

By contrast, the Respondent's interpretation “ignores the ordinary meaning of the
provision, renders portions of the BIT inoperative and offers an interpretation that
conflicts with the object and purpose of the BIT and finds no support in the travaux
préparatoires.”°°

Under Costa Rica’s interpretation, the term “regarding” should be defined to include
even the most incidental connection, regardless of the identity of the parties involved
or whether the judgment has any direct connection to the investor or impact on the
investment. In addition, according to Costa Rica, judicial decisions may never be
challenged because they are judgments “regarding” themselves.°*' Costa Rica also
ignores that the “measure” affected by the judgment must be the one “alleged to be in

breach.” Costa Rica’s interpretation contradicts the plain meaning of these
terms,°°° as well as the context of Article XII(3)(d):

a. “Read in harmony with the broader context of the BIT, the ‘judgment’ must be
‘regarding’ the application of the ‘measure’ to Infinito before Article XII(3)(d) will
be engaged;” “[iJt is not enough for there to be a tenuous, immaterial connection
or for the judgment to relate to aspects of the measure not directed at Infinito’s
investments.”*%

b. Citing Methanex, where the tribunal was interpreting the phrase “relating to,” the
Claimant argues that the term “regarding” should be “defined with some form of
logical limit, that requires proximity between the investor, measure and
judgment.” For a “judgment” to be “regarding” a “measure [...] alleged to be in
breach,” it must relate to the investor's allegation as to how that measure
breached its rights. Accordingly, “the judgment must relate to the application of
the measure to Infinito or its investments.”°° According to the Claimant, ‘[t]he
question is not whether there are any judgments relating to Infinito’s claims;” the
question is “whether there are judgments regarding the measures alleged to be in
breach.”*°”

c. Nor can a judgment be “regarding” itself: as explained above, the term
“regarding” requires a connection between two discrete entities. The Respondent
cannot circumvent this requirement by artificially bifurcating judgments into
written reasons and dispositive results: “[w]hen investors challenge judicial
measures, they challenge the ‘obligation created by the decree of the court;’ the
‘measure’ is the ‘judgment.’”°°2

Costa Rica’s interpretation would also exclude any challenge to a judicial measure,
even if the claim is for denial of justice or expropriation.*°° According to the Claimant,
this is inconsistent with the ordinary meaning and context of Article XII(3)(d), as
evidenced by other provisions of the BIT. According to Article I(i) of the BIT, a
“measure” includes “any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice,” which
encompasses judicial decisions and processes, as recognized in Article 4 of the ILC
Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that “[t]he conduct of any State organ
shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ

exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions [...]," and by
international tribunals.4°° While the ordinary meaning of a term may be supplanted by
a special agreed meaning, the party invoking a special meaning must meet a high
burden of proof, which the Respondent has failed to meet.*°’ To the contrary, the list
in Article I(i) of the BIT is non-exhaustive (as evidenced by the use of the word
“includes”) and already encompasses judicial measures (which are included in the
categories of law, procedure, requirement and practice).*2

In addition, under Costa Rica’s interpretation, an investor would never be able to
challenge an executive, administrative or legislative measure, if it has been the
subject of a Costa Rican judgment. Nor could the investor challenge the court
judgment.“ By insulating all judicial measures from review, Costa Rica’s
interpretation would render many treaty provisions meaningless, including Costa
Rica’s unconditional consent to arbitration (Article XII(5) of the BIT), the right to seek
judicial review of an expropriatory measure (Article VIII(2) of the BIT), Costa Rica’s
obligation not to deny justice (Article II(2)(a) of the BIT).4° Referring to Pope &
Talbot, the Claimant argues that “[t]o exclude all judicial measures from the scope of
the BIT would create a ‘gaping loophole in international protections’ against state
conduct that breaches the protections of the BIT.”4°

The Respondent's interpretation would also be inconsistent with the purpose of the
BIT. For the Claimant, “[a]n interpretation that undermines the entire operative force
of the treaty frustrates [its] primary objective of facilitating the dispute resolution
mechanism deliberately established in the BIT.”4°° Indeed, “[iJnstead of creating a
functional framework for dispute resolution, it would render the substantive
protections in the BIT ineffective by allowing Costa Rica to shield its measures from
challenge under the BIT in almost every case merely by ensuring that a judgment of a
Costa Rican court were adopted ‘regarding’ any measure that could be the subject of
a challenge.”“””

With respect to the applicability of supplementary means of interpretation under
Article 32 of the VCLT, the Claimant submits that tribunals may turn to them only

when the ordinary meaning, context, object and purpose of a treaty provision leads to
a “manifestly absurd or unreasonable” result; not when the result is illogical, as the
Respondent contends. For the Claimant, “[t]reaty interpreters are not empowered to
consider the ‘logic’ of a provision; rather, Article 32 of the VCLT and the principle of
effet utile are directed towards avoiding ‘manifestly absurd’ results,” i.e., results that
“render[] a provision meaningless or [...] ‘untenable as a matter of international
law.’"4°8 Even then, tribunals cannot ignore the text of the provision; “they are simply
permitted to consider supplementary means of interpretation and to attempt to read
treaty provisions in a way that does not render them absurd or strip them of legal
effect.”4°°

In particular, Article 32 of the VCLT limits recourse to evidence of the parties’
intentions. The Claimant submits that presumed intention is irrelevant; intention will
only be relevant if it is derived from the text of the treaty or, if the text leads to
ambiguity or absurdity, from acceptable supplementary means of interpretation.“"°
The Respondent asserts that “objective evidence” of the parties’ intentions may be
considered under appropriate circumstances, but does not define this term.‘
Instead, it asks the Tribunal “to consider its unsupported assertions of what the
parties must have thought, without providing any text-based support for its
position.”“'? There is no textual support in the BIT or travaux préparatoires for the
Respondent's interpretation of Article XII(3)(d). In particular, the Claimant makes the
following submissions:

a. As explained above, the travaux préparatoires show that Costa Rica insisted on a
provision that would require the exhaustion of local remedies. The fact that the
drafters previously discussed and removed an exhaustion of local remedies
clause does not demonstrate, as Costa Rica now alleges, that Article XII(3)(d) is
a fork-in-the-road clause. It is “nonsensical” to argue that “the treaty drafters
decided, after months of debating one possible clause, to replace it with an
entirely unique clause that had the opposite effect, without any related
discussion.”4"3

b. Nor is there any evidence in the travaux that the parties intended to insulate all
judgments from being challenged under the BIT: had the parties intended this
result, they presumably would have said so explicitly, for instance by excluding
judicial measures from the definition of “measure.”“"

c. The Claimant also argues that the parties’ intentions cannot be discerned from
Costa Rica’s pride in its judiciary. While the Claimant “does not dispute that
Costa Rica is proud of its judiciary; it challenges the impermissible leap from that
pride to Costa Rica’s proposed interpretation of Article XII(3)(d), which is made
without evidence or justification.”“"5

d. The Claimant finally objects to Costa Rica’s reliance on an internal memorandum
that stated that certain rights enshrined in the BIT were also protected under
Costa Rica’s constitution.“"* This evidence is not probative. Even if it were
relevant (quod non), it provides no support for Costa Rica’s argument, as it refers
to the substantive content of Costa Rica’s constitution, not the procedure it
agreed for international arbitration.“"”

(iii) Discussion

The question before the Tribunal is whether Infinito’s claims are barred under
Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal recalls that the
relevant part of the provision reads as follows:

An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to
arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:
[1

(d) in cases where Costa Rica is a party to the dispute, no judgement
has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure
that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement.*!®

To establish the meaning of this provision which is disputed, the Tribunal will apply
the rules of interpretation contained in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT. It will thus in
good faith assess the ordinary meaning of the terms taken in their context in the light
of the object and purpose of the BIT (Article 31). If the interpretation performed in
application of these rules leaves the meaning “ambiguous or obscure” or leads to a
result which is “manifestly absurd or unreasonable,” the interpreter may resort to
supplementary means of interpretation such as the travaux préparatoires. |t may also
do so to confirm the meaning emerging from the interpretation obtained based on
primary means of interpretation (Article 32).

As noted by the Claimant, two conditions must be satisfied for Article XII(3)(d) to
apply: (i) there must be a measure alleged by the claimant to be in breach of the BIT,
and (ii) there must be a judgment regarding that measure.

Applying Article 31 of the VCLT, the Tribunal interprets the first condition (i) as
meaning the measure pleaded by the Claimant to be in breach of the BIT, considering

C-Rej. Jur., § 200; see also C-Rej. Jur., J] 219-221.

292.

both the measure and the breach as formulated by the Claimant. This is consistent
with the ordinary meaning of the term “alleged,” which is used as a verb in this
provision and should be considered a synonym to “pleaded” or “claimed.” It is also
consistent with the Tribunal’s finding at paragraph 187 supra that it must assess the
Claimant's case as it has pleaded it. It is recalled that the Claimant has alleged that
four measures breach the BIT: (i) the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which
the Claimant alleges annulled Industrias Infinito’s 2008 Concession; (ii) the 2013
Constitutional Chamber Decision, which the Claimant alleges refused to resolve the
conflict between that Chamber's decision and the 2010 TCA Decision; (iii) the 2012
MINAE Resolution, which the Claimant alleges cancelled Industrias Infinito’s 2008
Concession and extinguished all of its mining rights; and (iv) the 2011 Legislative
Moratorium, which the Claimant alleges prevented Industrias Infinito from obtaining a
new exploitation concession.

The measures alleged to be in breach of the BIT must also be “measures” within the
meaning of Article I(i) of the BIT. The Tribunal has already found at Section
IV.C.3.b(iii) supra that judicial decisions are included in Article I(i)’s definition of
“measure.”

As a second condition, Article XII(3)(d) requires the existence of a judgment
“regarding” the measure alleged to be in breach. Relying on the plain meaning and
the context of the provision, the Tribunal interprets the term “regarding” to refer to a
legally relevant connection between two elements, the “measure” on the one hand
and the “judgment” on the other. In the Tribunal’s view, not every legally relevant
connection will suffice: the judgment must be “about” the measure. Stated differently,
the measure must be the subject matter (or at least, part of the subject matter) of the
judgment. This is consistent with the equally authentic versions of the BIT in Spanish
and French. The Spanish version uses the terms “relativo a la medida,” which,
means “in relation to the measure” (and not, as the Respondent suggests, “related to
the measure” — the correct translation of that term would be “relacionado a la
medida’). Likewise, the French version employs the words “au sujet de la mesure,”
which means “in respect of” or “in relation to” the measure. In other words, the
Tribunal considers that the effect of Article XII(3)(d) is to bar claims when the
measure in question has already been adjudicated (i.e., subject of a judgment) by a
Costa Rican court.

The Tribunal does not accept Costa Rica’s argument that a measure that is in itself a
judgment can be a “judgment” about itself for purposes of Article XII(3)(d). As noted
above, the use of the word “regarding” clearly requires two elements, a measure and
a judgment about that measure. Nor does the Tribunal accept Costa Rica’s
contention that a written judgment can be distinguished from its substantive content
(i.e. its operative part), the written part being “regarding” the substantive content.
When a judgment is alleged to be a measure that breaches the BIT, it must be
considered in its totality. The act of the State is the judgment in its entirety. While in
most cases the alleged breach of international law will derive from the dispositif, the
latter will be informed by the reasons. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that, for
Article XII(3)(d) to be triggered, the measures challenged by the Claimant must have

94

294.

295.

297.

been the subject of a separate judgment by a Costa Rican court. The fact that two of
the challenged measures are themselves judgments is insufficient to meet this
requirement.

The Tribunal interprets Article XII(3)(d) as barring claims against acts of the executive
or legislative branches of the Costa Rican State (in other words, any non-judicial acts)
once there has been a judgment on these acts. It also bars claims against a judicial
act if there has been a separate judgment about that first judicial act. In other words,
once a judgment has been rendered (be it final or not) on any State act, and that
judgment has a direct connection to the investor, an investor cannot bring a claim that
the State act breaches the BIT. However, the investor is not barred from alleging that
the judgment adjudicating on the State act is a breach of the BIT. It is a different
question what substantive protections are available against a judgment when the
judgment is the measure alleged to be in breach, as compared to the protections
available against the underlying State act, but this is a debate that belongs to the
merits.

The Tribunal does not believe that this leads to an absurd or even illogical result. It is
perfectly reasonable for Costa Rica to bar claims against a particular State measure
when the measure in question has already been adjudicated by a Costa Rican court.
This reflects the BIT Contracting Parties’ confidence in the Costa Rican judiciary and
a desire for procedural economy. However, it would be contrary to the context of the
provision, as well as the object and purpose of the BIT, to exclude claims against the
judgment adjudicating the measure. This could void the procedural and substantive
protections which the Respondent granted to qualifying investors through the BIT of
any meaning, as every measure could potentially be the subject of judicial
proceedings in Costa Rica.

The Tribunal believes that this interpretation is consistent with the ordinary meaning
of the terms of Article XII(3)(d) taken in their context in light of the object and purpose
of the BIT. It does not find that the travaux préparatoires cast a different light.

After assessing the record, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has established
that no judgment by a Costa Rican court has been rendered “regarding” the
measures which it alleges to breach the BIT. Specifically, there is no judgment of a
Costa Rican court regarding the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. This is a
judgment issued by Costa Rica’s highest court (the Supreme Court) acting as an
appellate court, and it is not subject to review in Costa Rica. Likewise, there is no
judgment of a Costa Rican court regarding the 2013 Constitutional Chamber
Decision. To date, there has been no judgment regarding the 2012 MINAE
Resolution either. The fact that the resolution implements the 2010 TCA Decision is
irrelevant for present purposes. While the 2012 MINAE Resolution may be
“regarding” the 2010 TCA Decision, there is no judgment “regarding” the 2012 MINAE
Resolution. Finally, while the Respondent argues that there have been judgments in
Costa Rica regarding the 2011 Legislative Moratorium, none of these judgments has
a significant connection to the Claimant or to the measure alleged to be in breach.

The Tribunal thus finds that the Claimant's claims are not barred by Article XII(3)(d).
b. Are Infinito’s Claims Time-Barred under Article XII(3)(c)?
(i) | The Respondent's Position

The Respondent contends that Infinito’s claims concern measures which are time-
barred under the statute of limitations specified in Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT.
Pursuant to this provision, an investor may only submit a claim to arbitration if “not
more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first
acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and
knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.”"® The measures that
really caused the loss or damage alleged by the Claimant occurred before the cut-off
date for the statute of limitations.

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal must address three issues to determine
this objection:42°

a. First, it must identify the cut-off date for the three-year limitation period.

b. Second, it must determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known of
the alleged breach or breaches before that cut-off date. The Respondent submits
that the “treaty [...] requires identification of the moment when, for the first time,
Infinito knew or should have known that its rights to the Crucitas project had been
impaired.”** For the Respondent, [t]he triggering event is not certainty of such
impairment;” [nJor is it relevant whether because of later governmental action, the
relevant impairment may have been magnified.”4”? In this respect, the Tribunal
must also determine “when there is an earlier measure along with a later one that
confirms, implements, and/or reinstates the earlier one, which one should be
considered relevant for purposes of this Clause of the Treaty.”7° The
Respondent submits that “[t]he Tribunal must objectively determine the relevant
facts for purposes of jurisdictional issues, including this one, and it need not
accept blindly the Claimant's factual characterizations.”4*

c. Third, it must determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known that it
had incurred loss or damage before the cut-off date. The Respondent
emphasizes that the BIT asks when the Claimant first acquired knowledge of
having incurred loss or damage; it does not require the loss to be complete, final

or irreversible.*© Relying on Mondev and Grand River, the Respondent
contends that “damage or injury may be incurred even though the amount or
extent may not become known until some future time.”47°

With respect to (a), the Respondent notes that the Parties have agreed that the cut-
off date is 6 February 2011, which is three years prior to the date on which the
Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration (6 February 2014).*?” This means that “the
Tribunal must dismiss Infinito's claims if, prior to 6 February 2011, Infinito had already
acquired either actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged breach or breaches
and of any loss or damage resulting from such breach or breaches.”*”°

With respect to (b) and (c), the Respondent contends that the Claimant already knew
or should have known of the alleged breach or breaches, and of the losses that
allegedly derived therefrom, before 6 February 2011. “[Rlegardless of how Claimant
characterizes or spins the relevant breaches, the Tribunal must focus on the actual
source of the harm that's being alleged.”*9 The Respondent submits that the four
measures challenged by the Claimant “derive from two earlier measures which are
the truly relevant ones for purposes of the statute of limitations analysis.”*°° The real
sources of the loss or damage alleged by the Claimant are (i) the 2010 TCA Decision,
and (ii) the 2010 Executive Moratorium. As a result, these are the actual breaches for
purposes of the statute of limitations analysis, and what matters is the date on which
the Claimant first acquired knowledge of these measures and of the loss or damage
arising from them.

With respect to the 2010 TCA Decision, the Respondent argues that (as the Claimant
itself has recognized)**' the principal grievance alleged by the Claimant is the loss of
its 2008 Concession.‘ As a matter of Costa Rican law, this annulment was caused
by the 2010 TCA Decision.** While formally the Claimant challenges the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2012 MINAE Resolution, and the 2013
Constitutional Chamber Decision, all of these measures either implemented or
confirmed the 2010 TCA Decision. The fact that the 2010 TCA Decision was
suspended pending the appeal to the Administrative Chamber is irrelevant. NAFTA

jurisprudence confirms that “the limitation period under Article XII(3)(c) ‘is not subject
to any suspension [...] prolongation or other qualification’ and cannot not be tolled by
the simple expedient of instituting litigation against the disputed measure.”**

The Respondent points out that, under Article XII(3)(c), an investor “first” acquires
knowledge of an alleged breach and loss at a particular “date.” For the Respondent,
“[s]uch knowledge cannot ‘first’ be acquired at multiple points in time or on a recurring
basis.“ Here, the Claimant first acquired knowledge of its alleged loss or damage
with the issuance of the 2010 TCA Decision in December 2010, and acknowledged
this publicly in a press release dated 18 January 2011,“%° both before the cut-off
date.‘°’ In that press release, the Claimant stated that it was seeking to reestablish
the value of its investments and to reverse the negative impact of the 2010 TCA
Decision on the company’s share price.“*® While the cassation proceedings could
have provided hope that the Administrative Chamber would reverse the Claimant’s
loss, the fact that the 2010 TCA Decision was not reversed cannot be equated to a
new loss.“*° Moreover, Infinito was not certain that it would be able to reverse the
2010 TCA Decision, and the fact that it acknowledged that it needed to “restor{e] the
Company's rights or value” underscores that it believed that it had already suffered a
loss.4°

As to the 2011 Legislative Moratorium, while the Claimant formally challenges the
legislative amendment which entered into force on 10 February 2011, the
Respondent argues that this measure could not have caused it any damage, because
the Claimant was already precluded from obtaining new permits as a result of the
2010 Executive Moratorium, which had been in place since May 2010 and was not
abrogated by the 2011 Legislative Moratorium.**'

Further, Infinito’s argument that it was not affected by the 2010 Executive Moratorium,
because it was only after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision that the 2011
Legislative Moratorium had an impact on its investment, is factually and legally
flawed. Factually, the Claimant was aware of the loss of its Concession since the
date of the 2010 TCA Decision. Legally, it is irrelevant when the Claimant actually
became aware of the loss of its Concession; what matters is that it should have

known about the existing moratorium, which applied to Infinito from the moment of its
enactment.“42

In response to the argument that the Tribunal must focus on the breaches as alleged
by the Claimant, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has no right to tactically
plead its case in a way designed to defeat temporal limitations established in a
treaty.“7 The fact that the BIT refers to an “alleged” breach does not mean that the
Tribunal must accept the Claimant’s characterization of the breaches. The word
“alleged” is simply used to denote that a breach has not been established; it “does not
imply that, to resolve a jurisdictional issue, such as the applicability of a statute of
limitations, a Tribunal may not look beyond what is ‘alleged’.”“44 Investment
arbitration jurisprudence confirms that it is for the Tribunal, applying an objective
standard, to identify the relevant breach, and that “if [a] claimant was harmed by a
particular measure that is outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the claimant cannot
overcome the jurisdictional bar merely by pretending that their [sic] challenge is
targeted at a different set of measures.”“® According to the Respondent,
“[s]ubstance must prevail over form, and tribunals must take care to distinguish
between, on the one hand, good faith arguments that a treaty’s temporal
requirements have been satisfied, and, on the other, abusive attempts to defeat a
temporal objection by means of unilateral characterizations and artful pleading.”““° In
support, the Respondent relies in particular on the following cases:

a. Corona, in which the tribunal held that “[w]here a ‘series of similar and related
actions by a respondent state’ is at issue, an investor cannot evade the
limitations period by basing its claim on ‘the most recent transgression in that
series.'"44”

b. Vieira, where the tribunal found that the dispute predated the relevant treaty
because all of the claims derived from the State’s denial of a fishing license
application before the treaty entered into force. This was despite the claimant's
argument that appeals were filed after the treaty had entered into force, and that
the fact they had been denied constituted separate violations of the treaty.“®

c. ST-AD, where an attempt by a claimant to acquire jurisdiction by resubmitting an
application that had been denied before it became an investor was rejected by
the tribunal: “a tactic based on the resubmission of an application that has been

denied before a claimant becomes an investor after it has acquired such status is
unacceptable. It creates an illusion of an event that happened when a protected
investor was on the scene. But like all illusions, it is a misleading illusion.”"“°

Contrary to the Claimant's contention, the 2010 TCA Decision is not merely a
background fact that may inform the Tribunal’s analysis; it is the central judgment that
produced the legal effects that the Claimant complains of in this arbitration. The
Claimant’s reliance on Tecmed is misplaced as, contrary to the situation in that case,
here the Claimant fully assessed the significance and effects of the 2010 TCA
Decision as soon as it was issued.° Renée Rose Levy is similarly inapposite, as
here it is clear that the dispute crystallized on the date of the annulment of Infinito’s
2008 Concession by the 2010 TCA Decision.**' Nor can the Claimant rely on Apotex
and Mondev for the proposition that, in cases involving judicial decisions, an injury
typically does not crystallize until the final decision is rendered: the question under
Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT is when Infinito itself first believed that its rights had been
violated and that it suffered a loss.*** Indeed, the tribunal in Apotex dismissed one of
the claims (arising from administrative proceedings) as untimely, and held that a
claimant cannot use late court proceedings to toll the earlier limitation period.**
Similarly, the Mondev tribunal reasoned that “[t]he mere fact that earlier conduct has
gone unremedied or unredressed when a treaty enters into force does not justify a
tribunal applying the treaty retrospectively to that conduct,” a reasoning that should be
applied by analogy here.**

In response to the Claimant's contention that none of its investments became
substantially worthless until after the issuance of the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision, the Respondent argues that the BIT does not require evidence of the extent
of the damage or loss, nor that the investment has been rendered substantially
worthless, only that damage or loss was incurred.*®° As such, expert analysis of the
degree of impairment of the investment at different points in time is irrelevant for the
determination of whether the claim is time-barred.4°°

Respondent adds that, in any event, it is clear from the Claimant’s January 2011
press release that it believed that the value of its investment had been significantly
impacted by the 2010 TCA Decision, if not entirely lost, as of that time. Relying on

Rusoro, the Respondent argues that such knowledge is sufficient to trigger the statute
of limitations. In that case, the tribunal found that Rusoro’s claim was barred under
the relevant statute of limitations because the claimant had admitted knowledge of its
loss more than three years before bringing the arbitration. In circumstances similar to
those here, the tribunal concluded that “what is required is simply knowledge that loss
or damage has been caused, even if the extent and quantification are still unclear."45”

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant denies that its claims are time-barred under Article XII(3)(c). The
Respondent’s objections, namely that the measures the Claimant is “really”
challenging are: (i) the 2010 TCA Decision; and (ii) the 2010 Executive Moratorium,
both of which occurred outside the three-year limitation period provided under Article
XII(3)(c), are incorrect and should be rejected. The claims must be assessed as
pleaded by the Claimant, and “[w]hen Article XII(3)(c) is applied to the measures that
Infinito_alleges breached the BIT, because they resulted in the actual loss of
Industrias Infinito’s rights associated with the Crucitas project, it is clear that the
arbitration commenced within the applicable limitation period.”"*°*

The Claimant emphasizes that Article XII(3)(c) bars claims only if three years have
elapsed from the time at which the Claimant first acquired or should have first
acquired knowledge of: (a) the alleged breach; and (b) the alleged loss or damage
sustained. The Claimant acknowledges that “[i]f actual knowledge cannot be
established, constructive knowledge may be imputed to the claimant if a reasonably
prudent claimant would have known of the alleged breach and resulting loss.”4°°

With respect to (a), as discussed in Section IV.C.3.a(ii) supra, the focus must be on
the measure that the Claimant “alleges” is in breach of the BIT. This interpretation is
consistent with the ordinary meaning of the terms used in the provision, as required
by Article 31 of the VCLT. As discussed in that same section, the word “alleged” is
not a meaningless qualifier; it denotes that the violations to be addressed are the
“presumed or supposed violations of [the BIT] invoked by the Claimant.” Thus,
“[t]he only relevant question is whether the breach, as alleged by the claimant, is
time-barred;” “[e]ven if a claimant references events that are outside the tribunal's
temporal jurisdiction, the claim will not be time-barred if the alleged breach itself is

timely.”“*' A respondent cannot reformulate a claim to suggest that it falls outside of
the limitation period.“

As noted at paragraph 157 supra, the Claimant alleges that four specific measures
breached the BIT, specifically, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2013
Constitutional Chamber Decision, the 2012 MINAE Resolution, and the 2011
Legislative Moratorium.

According to the Claimant, “[iJt was not possible for Infinito to have acquired actual or
constructive knowledge of the alleged breaches and resulting loss more than three
years before initiating its claim on February 6, 2014,” because “[nJone of the
measures that Infinito alleges to have breached the BIT had been rendered by that
time.”4°

As discussed in Section IV.C.3.a(ii) supra, the Claimant emphasizes that the 2010
TCA Decision “is not the measure that Infinito is challenging because it did not result
in the final or irreversible annulment of Industrias Infinito’s exploitation concession or
other project approvals.” According to the Claimant, the annulment of Industrias
Infinito’s exploitation concession and other rights only became final and could only be
acted upon when the Administrative Chamber refused to reverse the 2010 TCA
Decision on 30 November 2011. Until that time, the annulment of Industrias Infinito’s
rights was suspended and could still be overturned.. The 2010 TCA Decision could
not terminate the process in a definitive manner, nor could it be acted upon by
administrative agencies. The Administrative Chamber could also have rendered a
decision on the merits without sending it back to the TCA for reconsideration.“®° This
was acknowledged by the 2012 MINAE Resolution cancelling the 2008 Concession,
which stated that the 2010 TCA Decision had been confirmed by the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision and had thus become firm.“

Contrary to the Respondent's contentions, Infinito did not understand that the 2008
Concession had been irrevocably annulled as a result of the 2010 TCA Decision;
quite the opposite, it had every expectation that its Concession and other project
approvals would remain intact because the 2010 TCA Decision would be overturned
on appeal.“®” This is confirmed by Infinito’s many public statements reflecting its
continued and reasonable belief that it would be able to proceed with the Las Crucitas
Project, as well as its continued investment in the project and the fact that it continued

to employ 243 employees.“ This is also confirmed by the actions of Costa Rica’s
own Attorney General and environmental authorities, who “[b]y appealing the [2010
TCA Decision] [...] recognized that the annulment of the concession and other project
approvals was not final.”4?

In any event, relying on FTI’s expert report, the Claimant contends that Infinito’s
investments did not become substantially worthless until after the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision was rendered. According to the Claimant, “Infinito’s financial
statements, market capitalization, management statements and public disclosure, and
continuing investment in the Crucitas project after the [2010 TCA Decision] all
consistently indicate that it was the Administrative Chamber's decision, not the [2010
TCA Decision], that rendered Infinito’s investments substantially worthless. This is
confirmed by the actions of the [GJovernment of Costa Rica in appealing the decision,
and contemporaneous statements in Costa Rican media.”“”° It was thus on the date
of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision (30 November 2011) that Infinito first
knew that the measures it alleges to have breached the BIT had caused it loss or
damage.

Likewise, the Claimant's claim regarding the open-pit mining moratorium is not time-
barred. First, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium did not become applicable to Infinito
until the Administrative Chamber finally annulled the 2008 Concession on 30
November 2011. Prior to that final annulment, the Concession remained valid, and
Infinito was unaffected by the moratorium.‘”' According to the Claimant, ‘i]t is
irrelevant when the moratorium was implemented, since Infinito is not alleging that the
existence of the moratorium independent of its impact on Infinito breached the BIT.”4”
For the Claimant, “[t}he breach occurred only after the moratorium became capable of
affecting Infinito’s rights, which could not have happened before the Administrative
Chamber finally annulled Industrias Infinito’s exploitation concession on November
30, 2011,” “[o}nly then could Infinito have known of the moratorium’s impact.”4”°

Second, contrary to what Costa Rica suggests, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium does
not merely “duplicate” the 2010 Executive Moratorium. According to the Claimant, the
2011 Legislative Moratorium “subsumed” earlier moratoriums.*”% In any event, Infinito
does not challenge the existence of the 2011 Legislative Moratorium in and of itself,

but rather the application of that moratorium to the Las Crucitas Project. The
moratorium was irrelevant until the Administrative Chamber finally annulled Industrias
Infinito’s 2008 Concession and other permits on 30 November 2011. As a result, “the
fact that earlier moratoriums existed is irrelevant to the question of when Infinito first
learned that a breach had occurred and that it had suffered losses relating to that
breach.”4”5 In fact, in a May 2010 press release Infinito specifically noted that the
2010 Executive Moratorium did not apply to the Las Crucitas Project because at that
time Infinito still held valid rights in the Las Crucitas area, including the 2008
Concession. _Infinito had thus no reason to challenge the application of the
moratorium before November 201 1.476

Further, the Claimant highlights that it is also challenging the 2012 MINAE Resolution,
which it argues extinguished Infinito’s remaining rights over the Las Crucitas Project;
and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which declined on preliminary
admissibility grounds to hear Infinito’s unconstitutionality claim against the 2010 TCA
Decision. The Claimant specifies that both of these measures were rendered within
the three-year limitation period.4””

The Claimant further rejects the Respondent's legal arguments regarding the
application of the BIT’s statute of limitations. First, there is no merit to Costa Rica’s
argument that events outside the three-year limitation period cannot be relied upon in
establishing a breach of the BIT. Citing Tecmed, the Claimant submits that “[a]
tribunal can rely on preceding events, in its analysis, if those events culminated in a
breach that was itself timely.”"*”° Prior events must not be confused with the measure
challenged: “while ‘a dispute may presuppose the existence of some prior situation or
fact [...] it does not follow that the dispute arises in regard to the situation or fact.’””4”9
Circumstances that pre-date the alleged breach are not barred from the Tribunal’s
consideration; they “can provide the necessary background or context for determining
whether breaches occurred during the time-eligible period.”*° Tribunals may also
rely on events pre-dating a treaty’s entry into force, or pre-dating the moment at which
an investor actually acquired an investment, provided that the alleged breach
occurred after the treaty entered into force or the investor acquired its investment.‘

What matters is that the alleged breach itself is timely. Referring to Tecmed, the
Claimant argues that “[t]he limitation period would not run until ‘the point of
consummation of the conduct encompassing and giving an overarching sense to such
acts.”®? Relying on Renée Rose Levy, the Claimant submits that “the critical date is
the one on which the State adopts the disputed measure, even when the measure
represents the culmination of a process or sequence of events which may have
started years earlier. It is not uncommon that divergences or disagreements develop
over a period of time before they finally ‘crystallize’ in an actual measure affecting the
investor's treaty rights.”4°

Second, there is no merit to Costa Rica’s argument that in cases involving measures
that render earlier measures final, it is the first measure that crystallizes the breach.
According to the Claimant, “[a]n alleged breach that renders an earlier measure final
is still a distinct breach,” and “[t]he breach is crystallized with the measure that
renders its effects final.”“8* Invoking Apotex, the Claimant argues that “[jJudicial
proceedings [...] may form the basis of a timely claim even if they affirm the result of
an earlier, time-barred measure.” It adds, relying on Mondey, that limitation periods
will begin to run only after the issuance of a court decision that finally disposes of the
claimant's rights.“8° As confirmed in Corona, only the final, crystallizing breach may
be challenged, and it is that breach that must fall within the limitation period.‘°”

Contrary to the Respondent's assertions, an appellate decision that affirms and
renders the judgment of a lower court final can be considered a distinct measure
giving rise to a standalone breach.*®° The cases on which the Respondent seeks to
rely are either distinguishable (Sistem) or do not support its case (Apotex, Feldman,
Grand River). \Indeed, in most of these cases, the measure crystallizing the breach
pre-dated the tolling of the statute of limitations, and the claimant manufactured a
subsequent challenge to the measure despite the fact that no further procedural rights
existed under domestic law:*®

a.

In Sistem, the question whether an appellate decision amounted to a distinct
breach of the treaty did not arise, which makes this case irrelevant to decide that
issue.*°

In Apotex, although the tribunal declined jurisdiction over a time-barred measure
because the claimant had instituted further litigation to challenge it, it assumed
jurisdiction over claims arising from the final appellate court decisions
themselves.**' Applying the tribunal's reasoning, a direct claim against the 2010
TCA Decision would be time-barred, but a claim based on the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision would not.‘9?

Feldman and Grand River are inapposite because they stand for the proposition
that a limitation period cannot be suspended or prolonged, but here “Infinito does
not require any suspension or prolongation because the breaches alleged by it
occurred within the three-year limitation period.”“%°

Contrary to the Respondent's contention, Mondev does not suggest that
appellate decisions represent a failure to remedy previous breaches rather than
new breaches. It rather stands for the proposition that, to be successfully
challenged, court decisions must independently give rise to actionable breaches,
which the Claimant does not dispute. In fact, the Mondev tribunal did assume
jurisdiction over challenges to judicial measures.***

Here, all of the measures challenged by Infinito constitute new and distinct breaches.
All of them are positive acts by the Costa Rican Government that are distinct from the
2010 TCA Decision and do not fall outside the limitation period:*°°

a.

The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision upheld the 2010 TCA Decision by
applying the 2002 Moratorium to the 2008 Concession and other project
approvals, even though it had the power to reverse it, thus rendering final and
irreversible the annulment of the Concession and other approvals.

The 2012 MINAE Resolution went even further, extinguishing all of Infinito’s
mining rights, not only those annulled by the Administrative Chamber.

Through the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, a different chamber of the
Supreme Court refused on procedural grounds to address the 2010 TCA
Decision.

d. Finally, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium prevented Infinito from applying for a
new concession and other approvals.

Third, the Claimant denies that the limitation period starts from the date on which
Infinito’s rights were impaired, even if that impairment was not certain, as the
Respondent suggests.*® This interpretation is contrary to the plain meaning of Article
XII(3)(c), according to which the limitation period cannot start before the investor has
knowledge of the alleged breach. This means that a breach must already have
occurred, and any so-called “impairment” before that date is irrelevant. Relying on
Renée Rose Levy, the Claimant submits that “[e]vents that may give rise to later,
permanent breaches or which foreshadow potential future breaches are not breaches
at all under the BIT.”“°”

Costa Rica’s argument is also contrary to the context of Article XII(3)(c), because
certain provisions of the BIT (such as expropriation) can only be triggered by
irreversible State action.“ In addition, as explained in Section IV.C.4.a(ii) supra,
when the measure is a judicial measure, Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT precludes the
investor from bringing a claim against a decision that is not final. As explained by
counsel for the Claimant during the Hearing on Jurisdiction:

And the provision in XII(3)(d), which prevents a measure with respect to
which there has been a subsequent Judgment, prevents us from bringing
any claim with respect to the TCA decision. So, we're operating very
much consistently in our submission with the provisions of the Bilateral
Investment Treaty in respecting the particular provisions that the Parties
have agreed to with respect to when a claim can properly be brought in
this case.‘°°

(iii) Discussion

Pursuant to Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT, an investor may submit a dispute to arbitration
only if “(c) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the
investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach
and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.” The Respondent
argues that Infinito’s claims concern measures that are time-barred pursuant to this
provision, and the Claimant denies this.

After careful consideration of the Parties’ arguments, the Tribunal defers the
consideration of this objection to the merits. In the Tribunal’s view, the analysis of this
objection requires the analysis of factual and legal issues that are intertwined with the
merits.

As noted by the Respondent, to decide this objection the Tribunal must answer three
questions: (i) first, it must identify the cut-off date for the three-year limitation period;
(ii) second, it must determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known of the
alleged breach or breaches before that cut-off date; and (iii) third, it must determine
whether the Claimant knew or should have known that it had incurred loss or damage
before that date.

With respect to the first question, the Parties agree that the cut-off date for the three-
year limitation period is 6 February 2011.

With respect to the second question, the Tribunal has already determined that it must
consider the Claimant's claim as pleaded. This means that it must assess whether
the Claimant knew or should have known of the breaches as alleged by the Claimant
before the cut-off date. The Claimant argues that all of the measures that it is
challenging in this arbitration occurred after the cut-off date. However, the
Respondent correctly points out that Article XII(3)(c) requires identifying the date on
which the Claimant first acquired knowledge of the alleged breach, which in the
Respondent’s view requires identifying the date on which the Claimant first acquired
knowledge that its rights had been impaired. In the Respondent's view, the Claimant
first acquired knowledge of the impairment of its rights in the Concession with the
2010 TCA Decision. Without accepting this argument at this stage, the Tribunal
considers that, to determine when the Claimant first acquired (or should have first
acquired) knowledge of a specific breach, it must begin by identifying the date on
which the alleged breach crystallized. This requires a substantive review of each of
the measures complained of as well as of the measures that the Respondent
considers lie at the heart of the Claimant’s case (in particular, of the 2010 TCA
Decision). This analysis is deeply intertwined with the merits, and the Tribunal will
thus conduct it during the merits phase.

The same applies to the third question. For the Tribunal to determine when the
Claimant first acquired (or should have first acquired) knowledge that it had suffered
loss or damage, the Tribunal must first identify the loss or damage alleged and the
breach from which that loss or damage flows. Here, the Respondent argues that the
real cause of the loss or damage alleged by the Claimant are the 2010 TCA Decision
and the 2010 Executive Moratorium, not the four measures identified by the Claimant.
Accordingly, the Tribunal will need to assess the evidentiary record to determine the
loss or damage alleged, its cause, and when the Claimant first acquired knowledge of
that loss or damage. In the Tribunal’s view, this inquiry will be undertaken more
efficiently together with the merits, when the Tribunal will have a full view of the
evidentiary record.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal defers this issue to the merits phase.

Cc.

Are These Jurisdictional Requirements or Conditions for Admissibility?

(i) | The Claimant's Position

The Respondent has framed its objections under Article XII of the BIT as objections to
jurisdiction. The Claimant objects that, while Article XII(2) and (5) of the BIT contains
Costa Rica’s consent to jurisdiction, Article XII(3) (on which several of the
Respondent's objections are premised) sets out the conditions for the admissibility of
the claims.*° Specifically, the Claimant submits that:

a.

In Article XII(5) of the BIT, Costa Rica consents unconditionally to submit
disputes under the BIT to international arbitration in accordance with the
provisions of Article XII.5°"

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction (i.e., “the power of the tribunal to hear the case”) is
defined by Article XII(2) of the BIT. Here, the jurisdictional requirements set out
in Article XII(2) are satisfied because “Infinito (i) is an investor as defined in
Article | of the BIT, (ii) claims damages resulting from measures that arose after
the BIT came into force, [and] (iii) claims damages arising out of a breach of the
BIT for an investment in Costa Rica’s territory.”°°2

By contrast, Article XII(3) sets out admissibility, not jurisdictional, requirements.
For the Claimant, admissibility requirements relate to the “particulars of the
claim,” as opposed to the power of the tribunal to hear the case.°° Here, “Article
XII(3) sets out admissibility requirement[s] because it provides the conditions that
an investor must satisfy in order to submit a claim to arbitration."° This is made
clear by the opening language of Article XII(3) (“[aJn investor may submit a
dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph
(4) only if [...]”), and is supported by the fact that on its plain language Article
XII(2) is not qualified by or subject to the satisfaction of Article XII(3).5°°

As a result, the Claimant argues that Costa Rica may not rely on Article XII(3), or any
other provision of Article XII, to vary its consent to arbitration.°°° According to the
Claimant, the tribunal in Churchill rejected a similar attempt by Indonesia to import a
legality requirement into the conditions for consent.%°”

339.

The Claimant submits that the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility is
relevant because tribunals have consistently found that MFN clauses can be used to
import more favourable admissibility requirements from other bilateral investment
treaties.5°° Here, because the preconditions to arbitration set out in Article XII(3) are
admissibility conditions, they can be overridden by application of the MFN provision in
Article 1V.5°%

(ii) | The Respondent's Position

The Respondent categorically rejects this interpretation. According to Costa Rica, the
requirements of Article XII(3) constitute mandatory limits to Costa Rica’s consent to
arbitration.5"° The three-year limitation period and the bar on claims concerning
measures already adjudicated by a Costa Rican court “are not simply hurdles that
Claimant must overcome to commence arbitration, such as compulsory prior litigation
in municipal courts;” “[rlather, the requirements of Article XII(3) are strict conditions,
non-compliance with which renders Claimant's claim non-arbitrable.”*"' There is no
basis to assume that these conditions can be relaxed or disregarded, or that any
deficiency in that regard can be cured.

For the Respondent, the words “only if’ used in Article XII(3) “leave no doubt as to the
jurisdictional nature of the provision.”*'? In addition, Costa Rica’s “unconditional
consent” to arbitration in Article XII(5) expressly states that it is given “in accordance
with the provisions of [Article XIl].”. Accordingly, it must be understood that this
unconditional consent is contingent upon the requirements of Article XII(3) being
met.5"° Citing the ICJ in the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo case, the
Respondent submits that when consent to jurisdiction is expressed in a
compromissory clause, any conditions to which such consent is subject will constitute

limits to jurisdiction, and not conditions for admissibility.°"* Citing the ICJ and the
decision in ICS Inspection and Control, the Respondent argues that consent to
jurisdiction must be indisputable and may not be presumed, and that the burden of
proof falls on the Claimant."

In any event, the Respondent denies that MFN clauses can be used to import more
favorable admissibility requirements from other bilateral investment treaties, as the
Claimant contends.*"® Relying on Plama “an MFN provision in a basic treaty does not
incorporate by reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in
another treaty, unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the
Contracting Parties intended to incorporate them,” which is not the case here.°"”

(iii) Discussion

The Parties dispute whether the requirements set out in Article XII(3) are jurisdictional
or go to the admissibility of the claims.

The Tribunal notes that the disagreement between the Parties is only relevant if the
Tribunal finds that at least one of the objections based on this provision is sustained.
In the Claimant's view, even if the Tribunal were to conclude that one of the
requirements of Article XII(3) was not met, because those requirements go to the
admissibility of the claim and not the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, they could be bypassed
by the MFN clause found at Article IV of the BIT.

The Respondent has raised two objections grounded on this provision: one based on
Article XII(3)(c) and another on Article XII(3)(d). The Tribunal has found that the
requirement set out in Article XII(3)(d) is met, so whether this requirement is one of
jurisdiction or admissibility is of no consequence. As to the Respondent's objection
that the claims are time-barred under Article XII(3)(c), the Tribunal has deferred the
consideration of this matter to the merits. As a result, the Tribunal will address the
question of whether it is a jurisdictional or admissibility requirement during the merits
phase if it becomes relevant, i.e., if the Tribunal considers that the requirement has
not been met and Costa Rica’s objection is sustained.

Other Objections

a. Do the Claims Fall under the Exclusion Contained in Annex I, Section III(1)
of the BIT?

Annex |, Section III(1) of the BIT provides as follows:

Ill. General Exceptions and Exemptions:

1. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Contracting
Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise
consistent with this Agreement that it considers appropriate to ensure that
investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to
environmental concerns.

(i) | The Respondent's Position

According to the Respondent, “the judicial, executive and administrative acts
challenged in this arbitration are limited to maintenance and enforcement of pre-
existing environmental measures, and are therefore barred by Annex |, Section III(1)
of the BIT, taken together with the other jurisdictional limitations of the BIT.”5"®

The Respondent appears to acknowledge that, as this provision requires measures to
be “otherwise consistent” with the BIT, it could be argued that this is a matter for the
merits. However, the Respondent also contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction
to consider whether measures that pre-date 6 February 2011 (i.e., the cut-off date for
purposes of the statute of limitations) are consistent with the BIT. “Thus, provided
that such measures are motivated by environmental concerns, the language of Article
Ill Annex | prohibits challenges to any State acts that adopt, maintain or enforce such
a preexisting environmental measure.”5'9

As explained in previous sections, the Respondent submits that the rea/ measures
being challenged pre-date the cut-off date, while the measures formally challenged by
the Claimant merely adopt, maintain or enforce these pre-existing measures. As all of
these measures (pre-existing or not) were motivated by environmental concerns, the
Respondent submits that they are barred by Annex I, Section IlII(1) of the BIT.5°

Specifically, relying on Dr. Ubico’s expert report, the Respondent argues that each of
the acts challenged in this arbitration merely maintain and/or enforce pre-existing
environmental measures:°*

a. The 2010 TCA Decision that annulled the 2008 Concession enforced the 2002
Moratorium as well as the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision, both of which
were dictated by environmental concerns. In addition, the 2010 TCA Decision

itself is motivated by environmental concerns, and is therefore also an
environmental measure.

b. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2013 Constitutional
Chamber Decision simply maintained the 2010 TCA Decision, essentially
preserving the status quo ante.

c. The 2012 MINAE Resolution enforced the 2010 TCA Decision, without going
beyond it.

d. The 2011 Legislative Moratorium maintained and enforced the 2010 Executive
Moratorium, which was already in force under the pre-existing Arias and
Chinchilla Moratorium Decrees. According to the Respondent, the 2011
Legislative Moratorium did not go beyond the scope of these decrees.

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant denies that its claims are barred by Annex |, Section III(1) of the BIT.
This provision is not a defense to the Respondent's breaches of the BIT; it only
applies to environmental measures that are otherwise consistent with the BIT, and it
does not alter or override substantive treaty obligations. This means that the
Respondent cannot invoke this provision as a defense in respect of measures that do
breach the BIT. As a result, the Claimant submits that “the provision is irrelevant to
the Tribunal’s determination of the merits of Infinito’s claims.”°

This interpretation, so says the Claimant, is consistent with the plain meaning of the
terms “otherwise consistent with this Agreement,” and has been confirmed by
commentators and tribunals alike.*? This does not mean that the provision is
ineffective or devoid of meaning, as it confirms the State’s right to sanction breaches
of its environmental laws in a manner that is not otherwise inconsistent with the

“otherwise consistent with this Agreement” meaningless. The Claimant also notes
that these terms are not present in other exceptions in Annex |, Section III.5%

The Claimant further submits that the Respondent's attempt to link Annex |, Section
lI(1) of the BIT to the limitation period under Article XII(3)(c) is unfounded. The
“otherwise consistent with this Agreement” language not only applies to new
measures that are “adopted,” but also to measures that “maintain” or “enforce” an
earlier measure. In any event, the limitation period is irrelevant because it only bars
claims that relate to breaches or losses that became known more than three years
before the claim was initiated; it does not bar claims for breaches or losses that
became known within that period, even if those breaches are based on a measure
that “adopts” or “maintains” an earlier measure.°”°

In any event, the Claimant denies that the annulment of its Concession and other
project approvals were motivated by bona fide environmental concerns. The
evidence shows that the Claimant’s rights were annulled for technical and
administrative reasons.*°”

In this respect, relying on Metalclad, the Claimant submits that the environmental
measures exception contained in Article 1114 of the NAFTA (on which Annex |,
Section Ill(1) of the BIT is based) does not apply where the competent authorities of
the host State have previously found the project to be environmentally sound,°” as is
the case here. Indeed, the Claimant emphasizes that the Las Crucitas Project was
determined to be environmentally sound by the appropriate Costa Rican authorities:

a. The SETENA, Costa Rica’s national body charged with environmental approvals,
approved the Environmental Impact Assessments for the Las Crucitas Project
and declared the project environmentally viable.5°9

b. The SINAC, the national system of conservation areas, approved Industrias
Infinito’s land use change permit allowing it to fell trees.

c. The SINAC, SETENA and the Attorney-General of Costa Rica defended the Las
Crucitas Project's approvals before the Constitutional Chamber, arguing that they
were environmentally viable and in conformity with Costa Rica’s constitutional
right to a healthy and ecologically-balanced environment.**'

d. The Constitutional Chamber (which is the court with jurisdiction over
environmental protection) rendered a detailed decision “exhaustively analyzing
the Crucitas project’s environmental effects and conclusively determining that the
project posed no threat to the environment.”592

Moreover, according to the Claimant, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was
not based on environmental concerns, but rather on the technical application of the
2002 Moratorium at a time when that moratorium had been repealed. Specifically:5%

a. The 2002 Moratorium could not represent a real environmental concern
considering that the Government repealed it. In fact, as the Administrative
Chamber recognized, had the Concession been issued two weeks later there
would have been no problem with its validity.

b. Further, the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to projects with acquired rights.
Indeed, under the same administration that enacted the 2002 Moratorium, the
SETENA approved the EIA for the project.

c. In addition, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was not based on an
analysis of environmental soundness. Rather, it relied on a technical analysis of
the principle of conversion used to restore the project's Concession. This is
confirmed by the fact that the SETENA, the SINAC and the Attorney-General all
appealed the 2010 TCA Decision, underlining the project's environmental
viability.

(iii) Discussion

Before undergoing an analysis of this objection, the Tribunal must determine if this is
the right moment to address it.

While the Respondent seems to acknowledge that issues arising from Annex |,
Section III(1) of the BIT could be merits issues,* it maintains that the matter is one of
jurisdiction or possibly admissibility, or at the very least a threshold inquiry. As the
Respondent explained during the Hearing on Jurisdiction:

So, you can call it jurisdictional, you can call it admissibility or anything
else, but it's a threshold inquiry that disposes of the claim because if
nothing in the BIT can be construed to prevent Costa Rica from doing it,
then there is nothing to talk about.*>

By contrast, the Claimant’s position appears to be that the issues raised by Annex |,
Section Ill(1) of the BIT are for the merits. Indeed, its primary position is that this
provision is irrelevant.5%° However, relying on the Tamimi case, it appears to
acknowledge that if the issue is brought up at all, it should be dealt with at the merits
stage.°*”

The Tribunal considers that any objection by the Respondent based on Annex |,
Section Ill(1) of the BIT is a matter for the merits. As is obvious from its plain
language quoted above, this provision sets out guidelines regarding the content of
measures that may be adopted, maintained or enforced by the host State. It does not
relate to the State’s consent to arbitrate, nor to whether a claim can be heard or not; it
relates to whether a particular measure has or has not breached the BIT.
Accordingly, it cannot be deemed a matter of jurisdiction or admissibility; it must
properly be regarded as a matter for the merits.

The Tribunal thus defers this question to the merits stage.
Can Infinito Invoke the BIT’s MFN Clause?

As discussed above, the Claimant argues that all of the preconditions set out in
Article XII(3) of the BIT have been met.°%* In the alternative, it submits that these
preconditions are not applicable by operation of the MFN clause in Article IV of the
BIT, and that as a result Infinito is entitled to benefit from the more favorable absence
of preconditions in Costa Rica’s bilateral investment treaties with Taiwan and
Korea.**° The Respondent denies that the Claimant can rely on the MFN clause of
the BIT to circumvent the BIT’s jurisdictional limitations or expand the scope of Costa
Rica’s consent to arbitration.54°

The Tribunal has already found that the preconditions set out in Article XII(3)(a), (b)
and (d) are met. It can thus dispense with reviewing the Claimant's alternative
argument in respect of these preconditions.

As to the precondition set out in Article XII(3)(c) (i.e., whether the claims are time-
barred), the Tribunal has deferred this issue to the merits. It will thus address the
Claimant’s MFN argument and the Respondent's related objections at the merits
stage, if necessary.

DECISION

For the reasons set forth above, the Arbitral Tribunal:

a.

Joins to the merits phase the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections under
Article XII(3)(c); under Annex |, Section III(1); and under Article IV of the BIT; as
well as the determination of whether the Claimant’s investment complies with
Article I(g) of the BIT.

Denies the Respondent's other preliminary objections.
Declares that it will take the necessary steps for the continuation of the
proceedings toward the merits phase by way of a procedural order to be issued

after consultation with the Parties.

Reserves the decision on costs for subsequent decision.
