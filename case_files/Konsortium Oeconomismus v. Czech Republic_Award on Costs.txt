I. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final
award and, ifit deems appropriate, in another decision.

AL

() Any foes and expenses of the appointing authority as well ay the
Sees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.

The costs of the arbitration in the present proceedings include the fees and expenses of the
Arbitral Tribunal (Art. 40(2)(a) & (b)) and the Jegal and other costs incurred by the Parties
(Art. 40(2)(e) & (9).

In accordance with Article 40(2)(e) & (f), Respondent is claiming legal and other costs in
the amount of CZK 8,629,867.85. Such legal and other cosis include the fees for the
services rendered by the ICC in connection with the request for the appoiniment of the
president and a replacement arbitrator, its share towards the advance on costs as well as its

Jegal fees and disbursements,

Respondent’s legal fees have been calculated! on the basis that 1914.70 hours have been

spent working on the present case.

The Arbitral Tribunal deems such costs, which were incurred over the course of three years,
to be reasonable given that the arbitration proceedings were protracted Jargely as a result of
Claimant’s failure to comply with the instructions from the Arbitral Tribunal as well as the

deadlines imposed on it by the Arbitral Tribunal.

In addition, the costs incurred by Respondent relating to the fees for the services rendered by
the ICC in connection with the request for the appointment of the president and a
replacement arbitrator and the advance on costs amounting io CZK. 704,049.73 were directly
incurred as a result of Claimant’s institution of the present arbitration proceedings. The
Arbitral Tribunal accordingly considers such costs to be reasonable. In this regard, the
Arbitral Tribunal notes that Claimant has neither contested the fact that Respondent has

claimed for all costs in CZK nor the conversion rate used for the costs originally in a

different currency.

The allocation of the costs

Article 9(2)(d) of the Treaty provides that “[e]ach party to the dispute shall bear the costs
of its own member of the tribunal and of the chairman and the remaining cost shall be
borne in equal parts by both parties to the dispute, The tribunal may, however, in tts
award decide on a different proportion of costs to be borne by the parties and this

award shall be binding on both parties.”

Article 42(1) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides that “[t]he costs of the
arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the

-6-

45.

48.

   

arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that

apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.”

The Arbitral Tribunal notes that in a case where no award on the merits had been issued, it

was held thai a claimant was to be perceived as the unsuccessful party in view of its failure
to orderly prosecute its claims.'

In the present case, Claimant failed to duly pursue its claim and persistently ignored
mumerous deadlines imposed on it by the Arbitral Tribunal including, inder alia, the deadline
for appointing an arbitrator to replace its nominated arbitrator JUDr Jiti Marvan following
the latter’s resignation, the deadline for its comments on the organizational matters to be
decided on in view of the proceedings going forward, the deadline for the payment of its
share towards the advance on costs, the deadline for the provision of powers of attorney and
‘the deadline for the submission of its Statement of Claim. In addition, the Arbitral Tribunal
never received the names of the members of the Konsortium. Nor did it receive any
submission from Claimant showing that it would have jurisdiction over the members of the

Konsorlium.
The Arbitral Tribunal accordingly considers that Claimant can be viewed as the

unsuccessful party in the present case given its failure to orderly prosecute its claim.

In any event, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that pursuant to the second sentence of Article
42(1) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and Article 9(2)(d) of the Treaty, it has

discretion to reasonably apportion the costs between the Parties as it sees fit talcing into
account the circumstances of the case,

In light of Claimant’s aforementioned conduct in the present proceedings, the Arbitral
Tribunal accordingly decides that Claimant shall bear all of its costs incurred in relation to
the present arbitration in addition to the reasonable costs incurred by Respondent in relation
to the present arbitration proceedings in the amount of CZK. 8,024,742.85 as well as
Respondent’s share towards the advance on costs in the amount of EUR 25,000.

‘The Arbitral Tribunal further decides that Claimant shall bear all of the Arbitral Tribunal’s
fees and expenses.

The Arbitral Tribunal notes that Counsel for Claimant has not identified the Claimant as
required under German law as the law of the seat of this arbitration (see German Supreme

See the Order for the Termination of the Proceedings and Award on Costs dated 2 August 2010 in the
NAFTA and UNCITRAL case between Melvin J. Howard, Centurion Health Corp. & Howard Family
Trust (“Claimants”) and the Government of Canada (“Respondent”), paragraphs 75-76.

CourV/BGI, Judgment of 21,1.2001-I1 ZR 331/00, published in NIW 2001, 1056), The
German Supreme Court requires an entily like Konsortium to provide exact details of the
names and identities of the consorts, of the legal representatives and the name under which
the entity is doing business. If the enlily is not sufficiently identified or if there is not
sufficient proof of its existence, the persons having commenced proceedings as

representalives of the enlity will be personally liable for costs.”

Asa yesult, JUDr _--c and Mr. . are accordingly personally liable for

the costs that the Arbitral Tribunal is ordering Claimant to bear.

BGH, NIW 2001, 1056, 1060: “Im Aktivprozess der Gesellschaft ist es den fiir die Gesellschaft

auftretenden Personen ohne weiteres zumutbar, die Gesellschaft - beispielsweise durch die méglichst
exalle Bezeichmmg der Gesellschafier, der gesetalichen Vertreter und der Bezeichnung, unter der die
Gesellschaft im Verkehr auftritt - identifizierbar zu beschreiben. Sollte sich im Verlauf des Prozesses
peraussielen dass tatséichlich keine Aupengeselischaft sxistien, miisste zumindest derjenige fiir die

der im Namen der den Prozess als deren Wertreter
ausgelist hat. Im Falle des Auftretens fiir eine nicht vaitrende Partei triigt der in deren Namen
aufiretende und die Existenz der Partei behauptende Vertreter als Veranlasser des unzuitissigen
Verfahrens die Prozesskosten (Senat, NJW-RR 1999, 1554 = LM H. 10/1999 § 50 ZPO Nr. 50 = ZIP 1999,
489 [491] m.w. Nachw.). Es ist also immer zumindest eine natiirliche Person als Kostenschuldner

vorhanden.”
