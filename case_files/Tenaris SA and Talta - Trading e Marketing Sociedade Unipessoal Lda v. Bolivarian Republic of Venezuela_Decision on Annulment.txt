3. On 11 April 2017, the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or “Centre”) received an Application for Annulment

from Venezuela.

4. The Application for Annulment was filed pursuant to Article 52 of the Convention
on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other
States (the “ICSID Convention” or “Convention”) and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules
of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”). In its
Application for Annulment, Venezuela requested that enforcement of the Award be

stayed provisionally pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention. !

5. On 18 April 2017, the Secretary-General registered the Application for Annulment.
She also informed the Parties that, pursuant to Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention,
the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID would proceed with the

B. Constitution of the Committee

On 17 October 2017, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that the three
members of the ad hoc Committee (the “Committee”) had accepted their
appointments. Accordingly, the Committee was deemed to have been constituted and
the annulment proceeding to have begun as of that date pursuant to Arbitration Rules

6 and 53.

The Committee was composed of Prof. Dr. Rolf Knieper, a national of Germany,
President of the Committee; Ms. Dyala Jiménez Figueres, a national of Costa Rica;
and Mr. José Antonio Moreno Rodriguez, a national of Paraguay. Mr. Marco Tulio
Montafiés-Rumayor, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of

the Committee.

9. During the First Session, the Committee and the Parties considered (i) the draft
agenda and the draft procedural order circulated by the Secretary of the Committee
on 3 November 2017 and (ii) the Parties’ agreements and positions on the draft agenda

and the draft procedural order submitted on 28 November 2017.

the Committee and a timetable for the proceeding, with the exception of hearing dates

for the Stay Request and the Application for Annulment.

procedural matters of the annulment proceeding, including the further schedule of

written and oral pleadings.

D. Procedure regarding the Stay of Enforcement of the Award

12. In its Application for Annulment, Venezuela requested that the stay of enforcement
of the Award be maintained until the Committee rendered a decision on the

Application for Annulment (“Stay Request”).”

13. On 19 October 2017, Tenaris opposed Venezuela’s Stay Request, asking that (i)
Venezuela post financial security as a condition to continuing the stay or,
alternatively, that (ii) the stay be lifted (““Tenaris’ First Submission”). Tenaris’ First
Submission was accompanied by Exhibits A/C-1 to A/C-30, and Legal Authorities
A/CLA-1 to A/CLA-37.

14. By letter dated 20 October 2017, the Committee informed the Parties that, as
contemplated by Arbitration Rule 54(2), “it ha[d] decided to extend the provisional
stay of enforcement of the [A]ward until it rule[d] on such request after receiving the

parties’ submissions to that effect.”*

15. On the same letter of 20 October 2017, the Committee fixed a timetable for the

exchange of written and oral submissions on the Stay Request.

Ill. THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

A. The Applicant’s Request for Relief

38. In its Memorial, as well as in its Reply and PHB, Venezuela requests that:

“(a) The Award rendered in this case be annulled pursuant to Article 52 and
Arbitration 50 of the ICSID Convention;

(b) Tenaris and Talta be ordered to pay all costs and legal expenses arising
out of these proceedings.”®
B. The Respondents’ Request for Relief

39. In its Counter-Memorial, Rejoinder and PHB, Tenaris requests that the Committee:

“(a) Reject Venezuela’s request for annulment in its entirety; and

(b) Order that Venezuela bear all costs and expenses incurred by the
Claimants in connection with the present annulment proceedings, including
the fees of the Centre, the costs and fees of the ad hoc Committee, and the
Claimants’ legal fees and expenses.”

IV. THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS AND THE COMMITTEE’S ANALYSIS

40. In this Section, the Committee will first determine the relevant standards governing
an annulment proceeding (A), and then apply those standards to the facts of this

proceeding (B).

A. The Relevant Standards

41. The grounds upon which an application for annulment may be based are enumerated
in Convention Article 52(1). In the present case, the Applicant invokes three of these

grounds, namely:

(1) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers (Art. 52(1)(b));

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 17 of 129

(2) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure

(Art. 52(1)(d)); and

(3) that the Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based

(Art. 52(1)(e)).

The Committee has to interpret these terms “in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms ... in their context and in the light of its
objective and purpose,” as provided for in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on

the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”) of 1969.

As stated in the ICSID Secretariat’s Background Paper on Annulment (“Background
Paper’), the Convention’s drafting history demonstrates that “assuring the finality of
ICSID arbitration awards was a fundamental goal for the ICSID system.” * Therefore,
the “limited and exceptional nature” of annulment has to be taken into account as well
as its “narrowly circumscribed”? criteria. Its objective is “to reconcile finality of the
award with the need to prevent flagrant cases of excess of jurisdiction and injustice.”!°
An annulment committee should not qualify a tribunal’s reasoning as superficial,
substandard, deficient, wrong or otherwise faulty. All this would reassess the
reasoning of the tribunal which is only appropriate for an appeal. This does not imply
that the narrowly circumscribed criteria have to be interpreted restrictively. This
Committee agrees with the annulment committee in Mitchell v. Congo, which stated
that the grounds for annulment “must be examined in a neutral and reasonable

manner, that is, neither narrowly nor extensively.”!!

ICSID Convention Article 53 provides that an award is not “subject to any appeal.”
The Parties agree that “annulment is not a remedy against a merely incorrect decision;

annulment is not an appeal.”!? Therefore, the Committee has no competence to

substitute its own judgments on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or on the merits for

the judgments of the Tribunal.

With these objectives in mind, the Committee will summarize the Parties’
submissions for each of the three annulment grounds invoked by Venezuela. These
summaries are not meant to be recitals but orientations without intending

completeness.

(1) Manifest Excess of Powers (Article 52(1)(b))
Summary of the Parties’ Positions

It is generally accepted and undisputed between the Parties that both the usurpation
of competence by a tribunal as well as its failure to apply the proper law to the merits
of the case represent core manifestations of excess of power. Both Parties have
adduced a good number of decisions confirming these principles. It is further
uncontroversial, and simply a reflection of the ICSID Convention, that in both

instances described above, the excess of powers must be “manifest.”

Rather, the dispute between the Parties concerns the Committee’s competence to re-
examine the Tribunal’s reasoning and determination and qualify them with respect to
their conformity to its mandate as established and circumscribed by the Parties’

consent.

The Applicant is of the view that the Committee has the “power to conduct the
necessary analysis of the jurisdiction that the Tribunal assumed when it did not have

the power to do so,”3

and to “verify the excess of powers by analyzing the facts of
the case together with the sources of jurisdiction invoked’’', including “the duty to
make an interpretation of those sources.”!> The Applicant summarizes this point as

follows:

“Tf the Committee were to choose not to conduct a complete analysis of the
jurisdiction mistakenly assumed by the Tribunal from the very beginning,
it would simply be impossible to prove the existence of the ground invoked
and, therefore, Article 52(1)(b) would be demoted to an unenforceable
right, which would contradict the rules governing the interpretation of the
ICSID Convention.” !®

49. Venezuela relies in particular on the ad hoc committee’s decision in Occidental v.

Ecuador, which found:

“Jurisdictional excess of powers requires a finding that the tribunal has
misconstrued the applicable law (e.g. the law regulating ownership of a
protected investment) or has wrongly established the relevant facts (e.g.
whether an investor actually controls an investment). Article 52(1)(b) of the
Convention requires that the excess of jurisdiction resulting from such
misconstruction or from such wrongful determination be “manifest”; if that
requirement is fulfilled, the tribunal’s award deserves annulment.”!”

50. The Respondents refute this argument. They contend that Venezuela’s position, as
well as the holding by the Occidental v. Ecuador committee, would lead to a “de novo
review of the Tribunal’s jurisdictional findings,”'® to which the Committee is not
entitled as it would go “beyond the scope of annulment review.”'? They argue “that
where an issue can reasonably be resolved one way or another, and a tribunal adopts

one of those reasonable alternatives, there can be no manifest excess of powers.”

by an ad hoc committee under Article 52(1)(b) after the award has been
given.

be said that the tribunal manifestly lacked jurisdiction, and there is no basis
for an ad hoc committee in purported exercise of its power under Article
52(1)(b) to substitute its own decision for that of the tribunal. As the
tribunal’s decision under Article 41 must be treated as conclusive, in such
a case there is also no occasion for an ad hoc committee to express its own
view on whether or not the tribunal had jurisdiction.””!

The Applicant also raises a related issue on jurisdiction and contends that in theory a
tribunal will exceed its powers if it does not exercise its competence.” The
Committee will not venture into this issue as neither Party asserts such conduct by
the present Tribunal. The issue is purely academic under the circumstances of the

case.

To allow the award to be annulled, Convention Article 52(1)(b) provides that the
tribunal must have “manifestly” exceeded its powers when ascertaining its
competence. The Applicant agrees with Respondents on the fact that “manifest”
means “obvious” or “self-evident.”** However, the Parties differ greatly on the

interpretation of these generic terms.

The Applicant contends that ad hoc committees have the power and the duty to review
thoroughly the tribunal’s reasoning leading to the acceptance of its competence. It
quotes — along with other decisions — Caratube v. Kazakhstan. In that case the

committee held that:

“the power of any arbitral tribunal derives from the authority vested upon
it through the consent of the parties; if arbitrators address disputes not
included in the powers granted, or decide issues not subject to their
jurisdiction or not capable of being solved by arbitration, their decision
cannot stand and must be set aside.””*

decide the dispute. If not, the Committee has to annul the award which the Tribunal
had rendered appropriating a competence that it did not have.”° The Applicant further
argues that “manifest” does not necessarily imply substantial seriousness and does
not exclude that “an extensive argumentation and analysis may be required to prove
that the misuse of powers has in fact occurred,” as stated by the ad hoc committee in
Occidental v. Ecuador.?' In fact, according to the Applicant, “the manifest excess

does not need to be prima facie apparent.”?*

The Respondents refute the Applicant’s argumentation. They contend that such
argumentation would lead away from the concept of annulment as being an
extraordinary remedy introduced “to safeguard the procedural integrity of arbitral

proceedings,”?

and instead install “a full-blown appellate mechanism.”*? In their
view, “[t]he ‘manifest’ requirement was included in the ICSID Convention to
safeguard the finality of awards, and is an intentional limit on the review function

exercised by an annulment committee.”*!

They note that the “excess of powers cannot be ‘manifest’ if the alleged excess is
discernible only through elaborate interpretation of a tribunal’s reasoning (such an
exercise would, moreover, cross the line from annulment into appeal).”°? Instead, the
Respondents sustain that an excess of powers is only ‘manifest’ if it can be discerned

without great effort or extensive analysis.*>

interpretation or is otherwise open to debate, there can by definition be no excess of

powers, and a tribunal’s decision is final and its award must be upheld.”*4

The Respondents rely on Jmpregilo v. Argentina when they note that the excess of
powers must be “substantially serious”*> to warrant annulment of the award. They
assert that even if a committee might decide not to take the gravity of the tribunal’s
error into consideration, it has “to conclude that an annullable error actually had (or
could have had, according to Venezuela) a material impact on the outcome of a

case.”*°

The failure to apply the proper law represents the alternative limb for a possible
manifest excess of powers. Again, the Parties do not disagree in principle but only in

the determination of the borderline.

The Applicant submits that “the parties agree, as they must, that annulment
committees have the power to annul an award when a tribunal did not apply the proper
law and that a mere misapplication of the law does not warrant an annulment of the

award.”>7

However, it notes that a misconstruction of the applicable law, an “error of law that

is effectively equivalent to a failure to apply the applicable law,” **

or the wrong
establishment of facts, constitute a manifest excess of powers. The Applicant refers
to this effect — among others — to Occidental v. Ecuador and TECO v. Guatemala.*®

63. The Respondents disagree with the Applicant. They submit that an “erroneous
application of the law is not a manifest excess of powers.” Neither is it an alleged
partial non-application of the law: “a tribunal’s decision not to address or apply a
particular provision that it considers irrelevant does not constitute a failure to apply

the applicable law.”*!

b. The Committee’s Analysis

64. |The Committee emphasizes that it is not a court of appeal and that it does not have
the authority to substitute its judgment on jurisdictional requirements, the

interpretation of law, and/or the assessment of facts, for that of the Tribunal.

65. It agrees with the Parties that a tribunal may exceed its powers when it exercises

jurisdiction that it does not have, and when it fails to apply the proper law.

jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of tribunals. Tribunals have to assess
the applicability of the ICSID Convention to the dispute between the parties at hand,

and, once so ascertained, they have to apply it as well as the Arbitration Rules.

67. Consent extends to the applicable law. As Prof. Schreuer has stated, “the provisions
on applicable law are essential elements of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate and

constitute part of the parameters for the tribunal’s activity.”*? A tribunal that fails to

apply the applicable law transgresses the boundaries of its mandate as expressed in

the parties’ consent as much so as when it usurps jurisdiction.

These alternative expressions of excess of power are not simply juxtaposed but are
substantively interconnected. According to Convention Article 41, the tribunal is the
judge of its own competence. It has to exercise its judgment in applying and
interpreting Convention Article 25 and any other agreements between the disputing
parties (i.e. the provisions of a BIT, contract, investment law, etc.). Thus, an excess
of powers made effective through the usurpation of competence is the result of the

non-application of the applicable law.

In line with the jurisprudence constante, the Committee finds that the erroneous
application of the applicable law must be distinguished from its non-application and
does not lead to an excess of power. The Parties have no query in this respect and
agree — as said — that “‘a mere misapplication of the law does not warrant an annulment

of the award.”

The Parties have engaged in a short exchange on the question of whether an erroneous
application of the law may be so egregious that it equals to a non-application of it.
The Applicant quotes TECO v. Guatemala where the ad hoc committee found that a
manifest excess of powers may exist when the tribunal “committed an error so
egregious that its interpretation can be deemed untenable.”*> The issue is without
practical importance in the present case as “the Republic is not arguing that the
Tribunal erroneously applied the proper law.”° Rather, it asserts that the Tribunal did

not “effectively apply” the proper law.‘”

Ad hoc committees may only annul an award that was rendered by a tribunal in excess
of powers when the excess was “manifest.” This qualification must have a meaning

and cannot be ignored.

Different methods may be used to provide specific meaning to the term “manifest”
beyond general notions. One consists in establishing a prima facie test on the evidence
of the excess; another one is based on assessing the excess first and subsequently
determining whether this excess is “manifest.” The Committee believes that the
method must not prevail over the substance. Ultimately, both methods must examine

the facts and interpret the legal terms in accordance with VCLT Article 31.

In the Committee’s mind, the term “manifest” underlines the limited and exceptional
character of an annulment as opposed to an appeal. The finality of an award must not
be disturbed if the excess of power is not manifest. This objective must be taken into

account when establishing the standard.

Therefore, the Committee agrees with the Parties and a well-established jurisprudence
that the term “manifest” means “obvious” and “self-evident.” It further shares the ad
hoc committee’s view in Soufraki v. UAE, which held that:
“a strict opposition of two different meanings of “manifest” — either
“obvious” or “serious” — is an unnecessary debate. It seems to this

Committee that a manifest excess of power implies that the excess of power
should at once be textually obvious and substantively serious.”“*

This does not imply that whenever a tribunal reached a decision on jurisdiction after
an extensive argumentation and analysis, there can be no manifest excess of power
just because it may take the committee an equally extensive argumentation and

analysis to understand the tribunal.

Two levels of reflection have to be distinguished. The first level concerns the ease
with which the tribunal’s analysis can be understood. Once understood, the second
level concerns the ease with which the excess of powers can be detected. Only if the
tribunal’s extensive argumentation and analysis represent an ‘obvious’, ‘clear’,
‘evident’, ‘serious’, or in other words, a ‘manifest’ non-application of the proper law

(and therefore a usurpation of jurisdiction), will it be justified to annul the award. A

tribunal’s argumentation and analysis can be complex, extensive, deep and at the
same time obviously, clearly and seriously outside the scope of application of the

proper law.

The Committee finds support for this position in the ad hoc committee’s decision in
Pey Casado v. Chile, introduced by the Applicant, which held that ‘“‘an extensive
argumentation and analysis do not exclude the possibility of concluding that there is

a manifest excess of power, as long as it is sufficiently clear and serious.”*?

The Committee distinguishes these two levels.

It notes that even though a tribunal’s argumentation and analysis may be extensive
and complex, a committee may nevertheless find a manifest excess of power.
However, to allow annulment, the tribunal’s excess of power still needs to be clear

and serious in such a manner that it is “manifest.”

The Committee does not share the point of view of the ad hoc committees in Caratube
v. Kazakhstan and Occidental vy. Ecuador, according to which a committee may
require extensive argumentation and analysis to demonstrate that such excess of
power has in fact occurred. In the Committee’s view, such an interpretation may be
regarded as neglecting the ordinary meaning of the term “manifest” in the light of the
object and purpose of the Convention, and blurring the line between annulment and
appeal. Furthermore, a committee should not need to resort to complex argumentation
and analysis to find the existence of an excess of power by a tribunal, if such excess

of power was sufficiently clear and obvious to fulfill the “manifest” requirement.
(2) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure (Article 52(1)(d))

a. Summary of the Parties’ Positions

The Parties agree that a tribunal departs from a fundamental rule of procedure when

it disregards “the minimal standards of procedure to be respected in international law

* Pey Casado v. Chile, | 70.

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 27 of 129

proceedings.”°° Venezuela relies (as well as Tenaris) on a series of uncontroversial

decisions of ad hoc committees, such as Wena v. Egypt holding that:

“[Article 52(1)(d)] refers to a set of minimal standards of procedure to be
respected as a matter of international law. It is fundamental, as a matter of
procedure, that each party is given the right to be heard before an
independent and impartial tribunal. This includes the right to state its claim
or its defense and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it.
This fundamental right has to be ensured on an equal level, in a way that
allows each party to respond adequately to the arguments and evidence
presented by the other.”*!

82. Venezuela identifies the fundamental rules of procedure as including, “due process,
the right of defense, the right of both parties to be heard and to submit their claim, the
right of each party to properly respond to the arguments and evidence presented by
the other party, equal treatment between the parties, the treatment of evidence and the
burden of proof.”*? Venezuela states that “the principle onus probandi actori incumbit

constitutes a fundamental rule of procedure,”**

as well as “a fundamental principle of
law, an essential component of the due process rights of a party.”** It quotes Caratube
v. Kazakhstan and Kléckner v. Cameroon to this effect. In both cases, the ad hoc
committees held that “‘a reversal of the burden of proof could well lead to a violation of
a fundamental rule of procedure. It all depends on the importance, for the decision of the

Tribunal, of the subject regarding which the burden has been reversed.”*>

83. The Respondents agree to the list mentioned in paragraph 82 above except for the
criteria of “treatment of evidence and the burden of proof.” They contend that neither
the treatment of evidence nor the burden of proof is a fundamental rule of procedure.
They assert that “none of the cases and authorities cited by Venezuela support the

proposition that the burden of proof is a fundamental rule of procedure. [...] Indeed,

no ad hoc committee has ever annulled an award based on an alleged misallocation

of the burden of proof.”*° They argue that debates about evidence are regularly

focused on its weight and probity, and are therefore more of a substantive rather than

a procedural nature.*” Since Arbitration Rule 34(1) bestows a high degree of

discretion on the tribunal to judge the probative value of evidence, and since

international law does not provide for formal evidentiary rules, it is impossible — or

at the very least highly unlikely — that the evidentiary standards applied in ICSID

arbitration could ever be classified as “fundamental” rules for purposes of Article

52(1)(d).”°8 The Respondents rely on Continental Casualty v. Argentina where the

ad hoc committee found:

“that the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules contain no provisions
with respect to the burden of proof or standard of proof. Accordingly, there
cannot be any requirement that a tribunal expressly apply a particular
burden of proof or standard of proof in determining the dispute before it.
Indeed, the tribunal is not obliged expressly to articulate any specific
burden of proof or standard of proof and to analyse the evidence in those
terms, as opposed simply to making findings of fact on the basis of the
evidence before it.”

84. With respect to the cumulative requirement of Article 52(1)(d), according to which

the departure from a fundamental rule must be “serious”, the Applicant asserts that

the Committee has to ascertain the existence of the requirement under the specific

circumstances of the case and not “aprioristically or automatically.”® It further

contends that it does not have to prove that the departure from the fundamental rule

was result-determinative or that it would have won the case if the departure had not

taken place. Rather, it has to demonstrate that “the departure had the potential to have

an effect on the award.”°! The Applicant relies on a series of decisions by ad hoc

committees, such as Pey Casado v. Chile, stating that:

“The applicant is not required to show that the result would have been
different, that it would have won the case, if the rule had been respected.

The committee notes in fact that, in Wena, the committee stated that the
applicant must demonstrate “the impact that the issue may have had on the
award.” The Committee agrees that this is precisely how the seriousness of
the departure must be analyzed.”

85. The Respondents contend that “the departure from that fundamental procedural rule
must have been so serious as to deprive Venezuela of the intended benefit of that rule;
and the claimed violation must have affected the outcome of the arbitration (or,
according to Venezuela, at least had the potential to affect the outcome of the

arbitration).”°

86. For both criteria, the Respondents rely on decisions of ad hoc committees. For
instance, in MINE v. Guinea, the committee ruled that “the departure must be
substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the
rule was intended to provide.” Also, in Azurix v. Argentina, the committee held that
“the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result
substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been

observed.”

b. The Committee’s Analysis

87. In line with the Parties, the Committee subscribes to the definitional criteria set out
in Wena v. Egypt. If minimal standards of procedure are not respected, committees

have the authority to annul the award.

88. The Parties disagree on whether “the treatment of evidence and the burden of proof”
are fundamental rules of procedure. The Committee reiterates that the right of each
party to produce evidence in support of its case and the right to have an adequate
opportunity to respond to the evidence produced by the other party form part of such
fundamental rules. However, both do not concern the submission of evidence as such,

but are rather expressions of the rights to be heard and to be treated equally and

impartially. In that sense, the ad hoc committee in Tenaris I distinguishes correctly
both issues and “finds that the Tribunal neither shifted the burden of proof nor

breached any fundamental rule of procedure.”°°

89. To the extent that the Applicant invokes an additional element affecting the evidence,

namely its “treatment,”

the Committee does not see a possible fundamental rule of
procedure that may be violated by the Tribunal’s treatment of evidence. Arbitration
Rule 34 grants wide discretion to tribunals to order the production of evidence and to
judge its admissibility and probative value. The Parties have not adduced any further
substantive procedural rules of evidence that might be relevant to the present case,

and the Committee is unaware of any.

90. In addition, the Committee recalls that the different grounds for annulment in
Convention Article 52(1) pursue different rationales and must not be amalgamated.
An alleged non-application of the proper law and rules may represent a manifest
excess of powers and must be examined under the heading of Article 52(1)(b). Its
rationale is the respect of the parties’ consent, which limits the mandate of the
tribunal. Only if this non-application seriously departs from fundamental rules of
procedure can Article 52(1)(d) be invoked. Its rationale is the preservation of the

integrity and propriety of the procedure and not the application of the proper law.

91. Chapter IV of the Arbitration Rules contains the evidentiary rules of ICSID
proceedings. It confirms the standards of impartiality, equality of the parties and due
process. In addition, it confers discretion on tribunals to determine how to conduct
proceedings diligently and in the respect of procedural economy. While the standards
are part of the fundamental rules of procedure, the technical provisions on the written
and oral procedures, the production of documents, and the examination of witnesses

and experts, are not. They do not touch upon the fundamental requirement of

procedural justice and fairness. Their non-application may imply an excess of power

but not a departure from a fundamental procedural rule.

92. As to the burden of proof, the Committee has no doubt that the principle of “actori
incumbit probatio” represents a generally accepted rule. It is applied in many national
jurisdictions, either codified or as a matter of court practice, and also in international
law. The Applicant quotes a recent judgment of the International Court of Justice
(‘ICS’) where it recalls that “it is for the party alleging a fact to demonstrate its
existence.”® It further relies on abundant tribunal practice confirming that claimants
bear the burden of proof for their claims, including and especially when jurisdictional
matters, such as the nationality of a party, are at stake. These matters must be proven
and not only assumed.® The Applicant relies on Prof. Bin Cheng’s commentary
affirming that “there exists a general principle of law placing the burden of proof upon

the claimant and that this principle is applicable to international judicial proceedings.”””

93. That said, the Committee is unable to identify the principle as an unshakeable and
invariable minimum standard of procedure, as compared, for instance, to the right to
be heard and rebut evidence, due process, neutrality and impartiality of tribunals and
the equality of parties. In the words of the ICJ with respect to the burden of proof,
“[t]his principle is not an absolute one.”’! The Committee agrees with the Caratube
committee that “‘a reversal of the burden of proof could well lead to a violation of a
fundamental rule of procedure”, if for instance the tribunal did not treat the parties
equally or did not grant an opportunity to be heard on the issue. However, these are
consequences of other principles that have an impact in the treatment of the burden
of proof but they are not principles themselves. The Applicant relies on a dissenting
opinion in Soufraki v. UAE, where the arbitrator held, without further arguments or

reference to court practice, that “‘an erroneous reversal of the burden of proof [...] is

aserious departure from the fundamental rule of procedure.””? This statement in itself

does not convince the Committee.

Firstly, the principle is less a rule of procedure than a rule to determine the
requirements of substantive law. Although mostly relevant in court and arbitral
proceedings, it does not necessarily guide the process before the court or tribunal and
does not define the parties’ fundamental rights and duties. Rather, it provides an
instrument to judges and arbitrators that allows them to ascertain or reject a claim in
situations of non liquet. It is thus understandable that in certain national and regional
jurisdictions the principle is codified and/or considered as a substantive and not

procedural law and rule.

Secondly, to the extent that the principle is considered a procedural rule, it cannot be
considered a basic, invariable, and ‘absolute’ element of the corpus of due process
and minimal standards of procedure. For a variety of circumstances and purposes of
substantive law, such as consumer protection, product liability, tort claims, and
others, jurisprudence and legislators have adapted and even reversed the principle

when requirements of social justice and fairness seemed to require so.

Such changes and adjustments show that the burden of proof is not part of the minimal
standards and the fundamental rules of procedure. It seems that the appropriate place
to determine whether the principle or a law on the burden of proof has been applied
or not comes therefore under the realm of excess of powers and not of a serious

departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.

When qualifying the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in
Article 52(1)(d) as “serious,” the Convention reconfirms the high value of finality of
awards. It recalls the limited and exceptional character and purpose of annulment. As
the Applicant notes, the term underlines the “stringent standard of annulment.””> A
departure without any effect on the proceeding and without depriving a party of the

protection of procedural fairness, which is at the heart of procedural rules, cannot be

qualified as serious. Therefore, the Committee agrees with the decisions in MINE,
Wena, and others, that emphasize that the departure must be “substantial” to be

serious.

Does this mean that applicants have to prove that the departure has caused the tribunal
to render an award substantially different from what it would have awarded had such

arule been observed?

The Committee finds that the asserting party must demonstrate that, indeed, the
departure of a fundamental procedural rule caused the tribunal to reason in a way that

decreased the level of procedural fairness and protection in its disfavor.

However, an applicant must not and cannot be asked to prove in addition that such a
substantively untenable result caused by a specific departure from the rules of
procedure caused the tribunal to render a different award. The decision-making
process in arbitral deliberations is a complex matter and influenced by a variety of
considerations and compromise. It is not excluded, but by no means certain or even
probable, that the debate on one specific procedural rule may alter the totality of the

construct of determination resulting from complex deliberations.

(3) Failure to State Reasons (Article 52(1)(e))
Summary of the Parties’ Positions

The Parties agree that Convention Article 52(1)(e) requires “the failure to state any
reasons with respect to all or part of an award, a tribunal’s reasoning which is
genuinely contradictory, or a reasoning that is so lacking in coherence that a reader
cannot follow it.””4 However, at a lower level of abstraction, they present a different

reading.

The Applicant contends generally that the duty of a tribunal to provide coherent and
adequate reasoning is one of the essential requirements for the validity of an award,

as clearly established by Convention Article 52(1)(e) in conjunction with

Article 48(3).”> Venezuela refers to Convention Article 48(3) since “it requires that
the reasons be stated.”’® Relying on the annulment decision in Tidewater v.

Venezuela, and the expert opinions of Professors Alvarez and Reisman, it points to:

“the crucial importance of the duty to state the reasons for the decisions
rendered in arbitrations involving the analysis of public decisions made by
sovereign States, taking into account the fact that those interested in such
decisions include not only the parties to the dispute, but also the people of
the State concerned, which increases the duty of intelligibility and
transparency of the decision.”””

103. It further notes that the clear language of the Convention, which does not use terms
such as ‘manifest’ or ‘serious’, does not allow a restrictive interpretation. At the same
time, the wording ‘failure to state reasons’ must not be understood to mean a complete
failure to state reasons. There is general agreement that the ground for annulment
cannot be restricted to the “highly unlikely, if not virtually unimaginable” and
unconceivable situation of a complete absence of reasons and must extend to
situations of “lack, unintelligibility, inconsistency and frivolity of reasons”, as well
as “contradictory and/or insufficient reasons”, whereby “contradictory reasons are
those that are mutually inconsistent and thus cancel each other out.”’® Venezuela also
sustains that inadequate and insufficient reasons amount to a failure to state reasons,
whereby “inadequate or insufficient reasons are those that do not logically lead to the

conclusion posited.””?

104. The Applicant insists that the lack of reasons may not be replaced by mere reference
to elements, documents or decisions outside the award and must not be replaced by
the committee’s own reasoning, as clearly held in Rumeli v. Kazakhstan. In that case,
the committee stated that “an ad hoc committee should not construct reasons in order
to justify the decision of the tribunal.”*° In the same vein, it contends that ad hoc
committees do not have the authority to “speculate about what the tribunal allegedly
intended to express but did not state” but has to annul the award if the intentions are
not explicit.*! As found in Kléckner v. Cameroon, it “is not for the Committee to

imagine what might or should have been the arbitrators’ reasons.”*?

105. The Respondents assert that Convention Article 52(1)(e) does not “authorize
committees to review the quality or the persuasiveness of a tribunal’s

reasoning,”**

and that they may not annul an award “because it disagrees with the
reasons provided by a tribunal.”*+ They rely on a broad range of decisions by ad hoc
committees that have “‘consistently confirmed there is no basis for annulment so long
as it is possible to follow a tribunal’s reasoning through to its conclusion — even if the
award contains an error of law or fact.”®° However, the “reasons need not be correct,

or even convincing, for an award to survive annul ment.”°

106. Inorder to avoid “hair-trigger annulment” in cases where the tribunal’s argumentation

is perfectly coherent, committees are bound to make an effort to also understand the

implicit reasoning.*’

107. The Respondents refute the Applicant’s assertion that the failure to state reasons
should be interpreted broadly. They further contend that tribunals are not obliged to

deal with every question and argument that have been put before them to avoid

annulment. Instead, the Respondents sustain that the failure to state reasons must
relate to a point that is “essential to a tribunal’ decision.”** The appropriate remedies
for a challenge as to the substance of reasons as well as for the failure to address a

particular question are embedded in Convention Article 49(2).*

108. Finally, the Respondents emphasize a distinction between genuinely contradictory
reasons, which may give rise to annulment “if they do not enable the reader to

understand the tribunal’s motives,””

and the “tribunal’s appropriate weighing of
conflicting considerations.”®! In their view, tribunals must enjoy a certain amount of
freedom on how to organize their reasoning. The scrutiny for hidden contradictions
by ad hoc committees would necessarily transform the procedure into an illicit

appellate mechanism.

b. The Committee’s Analysis

109. The Committee agrees with the Applicant’s position that the statement of reasons is
a primordial duty of arbitral tribunals in general, and investment arbitral tribunals, in
particular. Indeed, the “legitimacy of the process depends on its intelligibility and

transparency.”

110. At the same time, the Committee agrees with the Parties that only a total absence of
reasons or a tribunal’s reasoning which is genuinely contradictory, or a reasoning that
is so lacking in coherence that a reader cannot follow it, warrants annulment. As
repeatedly stated, the Committee is not a court of appeal. It is not authorized to qualify
a tribunal’s reasoning as superficial, substandard, deficient, wrong or otherwise

faulty, and thus, substitute its judgment for that of the tribunal.

111. The Committee is mindful of the delicate task to determine properly the borderline

between an appeal and an annulment in the context of Convention Article 52(1)(e).

As Prof. Schreuer stated, “an evaluation of the tribunal’s reasoning is most likely to
blend into an examination of the award’s substantive correctness and hence to cross

the border between annulment and appeal.”?

112. It is true that, differently from Convention Article 52(1)(b) and (d), Article 52(1)(e)
does not add qualifications such as “manifest” or “serious.” That does not, however,
imply that the interpretation has to be broad and extensive. Rather, the omission is
intrinsic to the formulation of the ground: taken literally, a failure to state reasons (in
the French version: ‘défaut de motifs’) means an absence of reasons. This is in itself
so restrictive that no further adjective would add severity to it. At the same time, a
total absence of reasons is so improbable that an appropriate interpretation, taking
into consideration the mandate of VCLT Article 31, must extend the meaning of
‘failure’ to practically relevant insufficiencies such as total incoherence or genuine
contradiction in order to give an effet utile to the term and to satisfy the purpose of

the provision, i.e. the intelligibility of the award for the parties and the public.

113. This generally accepted interpretation is in itself a broad reading of the term ‘failure’,
which has a narrow meaning, without further restrictive adjectives. This extensive
reading must be exercised with prudence and measure. Efforts to move the exercise
further by labelling reasons as ‘frivolous’ or ‘inadequate’ will inevitably cross the

border to the scrutiny of the quality of the award and thereby to an appeal award.

114. Therefore, the Committee will proceed to assess the quality of the Tribunal’s
reasoning but will limit its examination to the question of whether the reasons are so
incoherent and/or contradictory that they cannot be understood and followed. This
threshold concerns the totality of the reasons in the Award, encompassing those
presented for the Tribunal’s competence and jurisdiction, for the merits of the claim,

the quantum of compensation, and the allocation of the costs.

115. The Applicant requests the annulment of the Award for the failure to state reasons

and bases its request on Convention Article 52(1)(e). It refers explicitly to Convention

% Schreuer, Art. 52, 344.

30

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 38 of 129

Article 48(3), which provides that the tribunal has to state the reasons upon which the
award is based.” It has chosen not to seek a supplementary decision of the Award by

the Tribunal in accordance with Convention Article 49(2).

116. Both remedies follow different rationales and objectives. Convention Article 49(2)
“enables the tribunal to correct mistakes that may have occurred in the award’s
drafting in a non-bureaucratic and expeditious manner,” while Article 52(1) is
concerned with the integrity of the proceedings and “would safeguard against

violation of the fundamental principles of law.”°°

117. The remedies do not exclude each other. Applicants are free to pursue one or the other
as long as the specific requirements for each of them are met. Venezuela is not obliged
to apply first to the initial tribunal in accordance with Convention Article 49(2) and
request a decision on an alleged failure to state reasons. Therefore, Article 49(2) does

not stand in the way of a request for annulment.

B. The Application of the Standards to the Facts

118. The Applicant asserts 16 different violations or issues which in its view give rise to

the annulment of the Award.

119. The Committee will address the alleged violations one by one. For reasons of
transparency and readability, it has regrouped the different issues under the three
separate grounds for annulment asserted by Venezuela. Although the three grounds
are each based on different requirements, on several occasions the alleged violations

are based on identical facts, leading inevitably to a certain degree of repetition.

120. The Committee has studied the written and oral submissions of both Parties carefully
and considered them during its deliberations. The purpose of the following summaries
of the Parties’ positions is not to rehearse them exhaustively, but to present the salient

features and in particular the points of divergence between the Parties.

(1) Manifest Excess of Powers
a. The Issue of Jurisdiction Ratione Personae
i. Summary of the Parties’ Positions
1. The Applicant

121. Asa preliminary matter, the Applicant asserts that the Committee has the power to

conduct a “broad-scope analysis”®”

of the Tribunal’s reasoning and that “a review of
the evidence on the record and even the submission of new evidence are not contrary
to the requirement that the excess of powers by the Tribunal be manifest.”°* To that
effect, it relies on the decision of the ad hoc committee in MHS v. Malaysia. That
committee found that the tribunal failed to apply the BIT and reassessed the tribunal’s
interpretation of the term “investment” of Convention Article 25 in a thorough legal
analysis, including going back to the travaux préparatoires of the ICSID Convention.
The committee came to the conclusion that the tribunal had omitted one of the criteria
normally used to define “investment”, i.e. the contribution to the local economy, and
that it had “reached conclusions not consonant with the travaux in key respects.”°°
The Applicant argues that the committee had rightly interpreted the applicable rules

differently from the tribunal, and had in fact conducted “a proper de novo analysis.”!

122. In the same vein, the ad hoc committee in Sempra v. Argentina equally “made an
interpretation of the applicable norms that differed greatly from that of the
tribunal.” !°! The committee concluded that the tribunal had failed to apply Article XI
of the BIT. After a thorough legal analysis of both BIT Article XI and Article 25 of
the ILC Draft, the committee concluded that both texts differed in substance and that

BIT Article XI should have been applied. In the committee’s words:

“Thus, the Tribunal adopted Article 25 of the ILC Articles as the primary
law to be applied, rather than Article XI of the BIT, and in so doing made
a fundamental error in identifying and applying the applicable law. The

Committee is therefore driven to the conclusion that the Tribunal has failed
to conduct its review on the basis that the applicable legal norm is to be
found in Article XI of the BIT, and that this failure constitutes an excess of
powers within the meaning of the ICSID Convention.”!

123. The Applicant maintains that the ad hoc committee in Enron v. Argentina had also
“made an enquiry into the underlying tribunal’s analysis” to find that the tribunal had
not applied the proper law but the results of an expert opinion. Not only had the
committee criticized the tribunal’s approach but had corrected the tribunal by stating

how the tribunal should have reasoned. In fact, the committee had found:

“The Tribunal’s process of reasoning should have been as follows. First,
the Tribunal should have found the relevant facts based on all of the
evidence before it [...]. Secondly, the Tribunal should have applied the
legal elements of the Article 25(2)(b) to the facts as found [...]. Thirdly, in
the light of the first two steps, the Tribunal should have concluded whether
or not Argentina had “contributed to the situation of necessity” within the
meaning of Article 25(2)(b).”!°

124. The Applicant concludes from these decisions that an in-depth analysis and de novo
review of the Award are appropriate and necessary in order to determine that the
Tribunal’s own findings on the legal requirements for the definition of siége social
or, respectively, the seat of the Respondents are not backed-up by the evidence.'!™ It
alleges that it “is manifest that the Tribunal failed to decide the case based on the

evidentiary materials put before it by the Claimants.” !°>

125. The Applicant recalls, relying on ICS v. Argentina, that “a State’s consent to
arbitration shall not be presumed in the face of ambiguity. Consent to the jurisdiction
of a judicial or quasi-judicial body under international law is either proven or not.”
Since Venezuela did not consent to arbitrate with claimants that were not investors

from Luxembourg and Portugal, respectively, and since Tenaris and Talta were not

Tribunal.'%

126. Finally, the Applicant states that the Tribunal had held that international law should
apply to establish the proper meaning of siége social, including the rules on
interpretation, and since that law does not provide for a definition of the ‘effective
seat’, the Tribunal proposed to look into “rules generally accepted by different
municipal legal system.”!°” Instead of applying these rules, it had “invoked only a
rebuttable presumption on the seat present in Portuguese law.”!°° “By applying
Portuguese law, as it did, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.”!”” The “Tribunal
said that it was applying principles of international law and ended up applying

Portuguese and Luxembourg law.”!!°

127. In developing its case, the Applicant does not contest that the Tribunal refers to and
interprets Convention Article 25, Article 1.b) of the Luxembourg-Venezuela BIT and
Article I.1.b) of the Portugal-Venezuela BIT. Likewise, it does not contest the result
of such interpretation according to which the terms nationality/siége social/seat mean

the effective seat and not a statutory seat.

128. Further, it agrees in principle with the Tribunal’s analysis that according to the

unanimous and undisputed expert opinions for both legal systems:

“the factors conditioning a company’s Effective Seat are three:

- The place in which the shareholders’ meetings and the board of directors’
meetings are conducted; the place where they are held is relevant;

- The place in which the management tasks take place, the place from which
a company reaches out to customers, where it signs its main contracts and
where financial activities are carried out;

- The place where the company’s books are deposited and kept.”'!!

129. The Applicant confirms that “[a]ll these elements had to be present for the Tribunal
to affirm its jurisdiction. They are cumulative requirements.” !!? However, it observes
that according to the expert on Luxembourgian law “the minutes of the board of
directors appear as the most relevant evidence to assess whether the decision-making
nerve centre of Tenaris S.A. is located in Luxembourg.” It criticizes the Tribunal for

not having applied this hierarchy of criteria.'!?

130. During the Hearing, the Applicant presented the minutes of meetings of the board of
directors to prove that they were authentic but “heavily redacted” and void of
content.!!* It alleges that they were not only submitted untimely! but that they do
not prove the effective seats to be located in Luxembourg and Portugal. The Applicant
asserts that Tenaris’ meetings were mostly held by telephone conference at times
convenient for South American time zones, that members of the board dialed in from
places that were incorrectly identified by the Tribunal and overwhelmingly from
outside Luxembourg, that most of the minutes concern meetings held after the date
of notice of arbitration and are of no value as to the establishment of the effective seat
at that crucial moment.!!® The Applicant does not comment on the Tribunal’s finding

that “Talta’s board of directors always met in Portugal.”!!7

meetings held by telematics means and that such law “establishes the presumption

that the meetings held by telematics channels are deemed conducted in the statutory

132. With respect to the other criteria that the Tribunal used to define the effective seat,
i.e. the meetings of shareholders and the place where the companies are audited and
the books are kept, the Applicant asserts that they are irrelevant. Both are “mere
consequences of compliance with the legal requirements of the place of incorporation
and, as such, they are irrelevant for purposes of determining the effective seat of a
company”: both Luxembourgian and Portuguese law require that accounts are
audited, and books are kept, and shareholder meetings are conducted at the statutory

seat, !2°

Board meetings were deemed to be formally held in Luxembourg, “but many directors
voted by circular letters”;

The company kept records in Luxembourg, “albeit incomplete.” !?>

135. Despite these findings, according to the Applicant similar to the present case, “the

tribunal still concluded that it did not have ratione personae jurisdiction.” !?°

2. The Respondents

136. The Respondents recall the “elementary principles” for both substantive and
jurisdictional enquiries “that annulment committees are not fact finders, and that
annulment committees are without the power to substitute their assessment of the
facts for that of a tribunal.”!?’ They rely on the ad hoc committee in Tulip v. Turkey,
which held that: “[a]d hoc committees cannot review an award’s findings for errors

of fact or law.” 18

137. They explain that the Tribunal had applied the Convention and the Treaties and found
—following the reasoning of Venezuela and its expert — that they all required that the
effective and not only the statutory seat was decisive to establish the nationality of
the investors. The Tribunal then determined the cumulative criteria that constitutes
such effective seat, again in agreement with Venezuela, with the exception of its
opinion on the hierarchy of the criterion of the meetings of the board of directors,
where the Tribunal had considered and rejected the expert’s legal argument.!”? “In
other words, Venezuela claims that the Tribunal identified the correct legal test but

then reached the wrong result based on the evidence.” !?°

138. The Respondents contend that in light of these uncontroversial findings on law, the
Applicant is only able to argue that the Tribunal erred in the appreciation of the facts

and that “an annulment committee has the power and duty to review the evidence in

full to find that claimed error.”!'*! Yet, it is widely accepted that ad hoc committees
do not have such power. The Committee is not authorized to reassess the evidence
and scrutinize whether the Tribunal erred in its assessment. As stated in Rumeli v.
Kazakhstan, “it would not be proper for an ad hoc committee to overturn a tribunal’s

treatment of the evidence to which it was referred.” !>?

139. Even the cases on which Venezuela relies to justify a committee’s de novo analysis
of the tribunal’s findings (and which have been criticized as going too far into the

direction of appeal), do not accept that committees might undertake a de novo analysis

of the factual findings of a tribunal.!*3

140. The Respondents rely on the ad hoc committee in Dogan v. Turkmenistan that found:

“The Committee shall not review the probative value attributed by the
Tribunal to the evidence on which it has relied to reach its Decision on
Jurisdiction. This is a matter of appreciation and evaluation of evidence. It
is repetitious to observe that it is beyond the mandate of this Committee to
revisit the conclusions reached by the Tribunal in such matters, considering
that it is not acting as an appellate body.”'™

141. Finally, the Respondents submit that the Applicant has failed to address the
“manifest” requirement, which obliges it to prove that the alleged error was — in the
words of the Impregilo v. Argentina committee — “obvious, self-evident, clear,
flagrant and substantially serious.” The Applicant has ignored that another tribunal,
which was confronted with the same jurisdictional issue with respect to the same
Claimants and Respondent, had correctly found that Tenaris and Talta had their

effective seats in Luxembourg and Portugal, respectively.'*° The correctness of the

tribunal’s decision has been confirmed by an ad hoc committee that rejected
Venezuela’s request for annulment in this regard.'*” The Respondents submit that:
“the Tribunal’s jurisdictional decision in Tenaris II cannot be an obvious
and self-evident excess of powers given that another tribunal has reached

the same conclusion. In that circumstance, any alleged jurisdictional error,
by definition, cannot be manifest.”'**

Instead, as the Respondents submit, the Applicant relies on a separate case — CFH v.
Cameroon — involving a different claimant and respondent, and different facts. The
tribunal in that case found that the claimant had abused its rights by “wakening” a
dormant company for the sole purpose of availing itself of treaty protection and that
the evidence was insufficient. The Respondents assert that:

“it is in any event misplaced to compare the evidence submitted in CFH to

the evidence supporting the Tribunal’s assumption of jurisdiction in this

case. Moreover, even if the facts of the two cases were exactly the same,

the different results reached by the two tribunals would not give rise to

annulment of one award or the other. At most, in such circumstances one

of the tribunals could be accused of making a factual or legal error. But that
is not a basis for annulment.”'*?

ii. The Committee’s Analysis and Determination

The Committee does not have the authority to scrutinize the Award for errors of law
and/or fact. The Committee will proceed to examine the Applicant’s ratione personae

issue within the limits of its mandate.

The Committee finds that the Tribunal has identified the relevant provisions of the
ICSID Convention and the applicable Treaties in paragraphs 165-174 of the Award
to determine its jurisdiction ratione personae. The Tribunal’s further research of rules
of international law has led it to conclude that “[i]nternational law lacks a concept of
“seat” [...] of its own”, and that it “was developed within the different systems of

Municipal Law. [...] Hence to give substance to the term, it is necessary to resort to

the rules generally accepted by different municipal legal systems.”'? It has then

turned to the interpretation of the Treaties in light of VCLT Article 31.'"!

By relying on literature, jurisprudence and expert opinions presented by both Parties,
the Tribunal developed its analysis in paragraphs 175-189 of the Award as to the
requirement of an effective seat to determine the nationality of the Respondents. It
reached its conclusion in application of detailed “hermeneutic principles, and in the
light of the rules of international law.”!4? In paragraphs 191-194 of the Award, it
identified the factors that determine such seat. The reasoning is exhaustive. It
corresponds to the reasoning in Tenaris I and has been largely quoted with approval
in CFH v. Cameroon, where the tribunal held that the legal argumentation in both

Tenaris I and the Tribunal in the present case are similar and appropriate. '*7

When considering the development of the Tribunal’s reasoning, the Committee does
not find a regressive argumentation based exclusively on Portuguese and

Luxembourgian law.

The Tribunal has identified a number of factors to determine the effective seat, in
close consideration of the Parties’ experts. The disagreement between the Tribunal
and the Applicant’s expert on the hierarchy to be given to the different factors is not
more than that: a disagreement on the interpretation of legal terms and by no means
a non-application of the law. It is not the Committee’s role to take sides in such a

debate on the interpretation of a legal norm.

Conversely to the circumstances in the annulments of MHS v. Malaysia and Sempra
v. Argentina, which have been presented above and which have both found that those
tribunals failed to apply crucial provisions of the respective BITs, no such situation

exists in the present case.

Given these circumstances, the Committee is not surprised to find that the Parties’
argumentation does not differ widely as to the legal analysis of the Tribunal. Rather,
the Applicant bases its case on the assertion that it “is manifest that the Tribunal failed
to decide the case based on the evidentiary materials put before it by the

Claimants.” !“4

Having found that both Treaties demand an effective seat to determine the nationality
of the Respondents, and having identified the factors that condition a party’s effective
seat, the Tribunal applied these legal determinations to the facts provided by the
Parties. In paragraphs 195-203 of the Award, it presented the Respondents’ evidence
that is meant to prove that they had their seats in Luxembourg and Portugal,
respectively; in paragraphs 204-206 of the Award, it presented Venezuela’s evidence
that is meant to prove that the Respondents’ seat was Argentina and not Luxembourg
and Portugal; and in paragraphs 207-230 of the Award, the Tribunal assessed the

evidence.

In a preliminary remark, the Tribunal has indicated that after having studied the
experts’ opinions and the accompanying evidence “‘it tends to think that in Portuguese
Law there actually exists a presumption that the Effective Seat coincides with the
Statutory Seat.”!4> Notwithstanding this remark, the Tribunal has “thoroughly
analyzed and assessed the evidence.”'“° Evidently, the Tribunal has not based its

determination on a mere presumption.
The Tribunal has found that:

- The shareholders’ meetings of both Tenaris and Talta were always held in
Luxembourg and Portugal respectively;
-  Tenaris’ board of directors met 8 times in person in Luxembourg, twice in

Mexico, and once in Argentina, once in the USA and 22 times by telephone

conference, which is allowed by Luxembourgian Law and deemed held at the
statutory seat;

-  Talta’s board of directors always met in Portugal;

- Offices, even if small, are operated in both Luxembourg and Portugal;

- The issue of the number of employees is irrelevant for the purpose of determining
the effective seat;

- The lack of operations with third parties does not imply the absence of business
activities as holding companies;

- Luxembourgian and Portuguese auditing companies audit both Tenaris and Talta,
respectively, and books are kept and stored in Luxembourg and Portugal,

respectively.

The Tribunal has concluded that “there is no evidence that Tenaris and Talta’s
Effective seat are located in Argentina. On the contrary, the evidence points to the

fact that Effective Seat is located in Luxembourg and Portugal, respectively.” 4”

The Committee finds that the assessment of the evidence and the conclusions are
developed with care. It has neither the right nor the duty to scrutinize them with the
aim to find errors and/or incorrect appreciations as long as they do not amount to a

suppression or manipulation of the evidence leading to a usurpation of jurisdiction.

The Applicant submits that the geographical location from which directors dialed into
telephone conferences was often not revealed, that the Tribunal did not correctly
identify the names of the participating directors, and that the time zone of the
conferences was appropriate for Argentina and Mexico but not for Luxembourg. “8
The Applicant has presented the minutes of meetings to prove its assertion,

confirming that the documents were authentic.

These allegations try to prove that the Tribunal erred in its appreciation. The

for that of the Tribunal, as long as it does not believe that the Tribunal mishandled
the evidence in order to establish its competence to hear the merits. The Committee
does not find any indication in this sense. The Committee agrees with the ad hoc
committee in Tenaris I which held that “it is for the Tribunal, not for the Committee,
to weigh the evidence adduced.” !*? In the Tribunal’s appreciation of the evidence, the
Respondents were Portuguese and Luxembourgian investors, respectively. As said,
the Committee is not authorized to reassess that evidence. Therefore, Venezuela’s
assertion that it did not consent to arbitrate disputes with investors from different

countries has no merit.

157. Further, the Applicant asks the Committee to be alerted by the fact that in CFH v.
Cameroon, the tribunal shared the legal analysis of the Tribunal in the present case

but reached completely different conclusions in evaluating the evidence.

158. The Committee has studied the award in CFH v. Cameroon and finds that those facts
are very different from the ones of the present case. In that case, the tribunal found
that for four years no shareholder meeting had taken place, no director had been
nominated, and the books had not been audited. The company had been “en sommeil”
for all those years only to have woken up (“réveillé”) for the purposes of the

dispute.!°°

159. Therefore, the issue was not one of effective seat but of the effective existence of the
claimant. The tribunal denied jurisdiction for this reason and for the abusive conduct
of the claimant. The difference of appreciation by the two tribunals is based on the
difference of the factual circumstances. It is not indicative of a mishandling of

evidence by the Tribunal in the present case.

160. The Committee finds it more appropriate to refer to the Tenaris I award, where the
tribunal assessed the evidence similarly to the Tribunal in the present case.'>*! The

parallel indicates, indeed, that the Tribunal has not manipulated or suppressed the

evidence and that it has not unlawfully arrogated the competence to decide the merits

of the case.

For all these reasons, the Committee determines that the Tribunal has not exceeded
its powers in its decision regarding the siége social and will not have to examine the
term “manifest.” Therefore, it rejects the Applicant’s request to annul the Award

based on this ground.

The Issue of Jurisdiction Ratione Temporis
i. Summary of the Parties’ Position
1. The Applicant

The Applicant contends that the Tribunal exceeded its powers “when it granted
jurisdiction without the parties’ consent under the terms of the Treaties. Since the
Tribunal fabricated jurisdiction where there was none, it exceeded its powers in a

manifest manner.”

Venezuela recalls the fundamental importance of consent as expressed in paragraph
23 of the Report of the Executive Directors of the World Bank on the ICSID
Convention: “Consent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the
Centre”, and reiterated in abundant jurisprudence and doctrine. The Applicant states
that ad hoc committees have the power “to review a tribunal’s findings for errors of
facts or law” since “through the application mutatis mutandis of Article 41 by the
Committee, the Committee has to decide whether jurisdiction existed under the

ICSID Convention.” !°

Without explicitly referring to Convention Article 72, it bases its argument on the
requirement that the consent to jurisdiction must be received before the notice of
denunciation of the Convention. Venezuela denounced the Convention on 24 January
2012. Only an acceptance of Venezuela’s offer by Tenaris and Talta to have disputes

with investors heard and decided by an arbitral tribunal under the ICSID Convention

that preceded the date of notice of denunciation would have perfected the consent.

However, that acceptance was only declared valid after such date.

The Applicant submits that the substance and the limits of its offer were clearly
circumscribed in the Treaties, and that Article 9 of the Luxembourg BIT
unequivocally provided that the offer was contingent on a previous notice of dispute

initiating amicable settlement negotiations.

It submits that the Respondents’ letters and notices, as well as negotiations between
different parties preceding the date of denunciation, cannot be considered valid

manifestations of acceptance.

As to Tenaris-TAVSA, it states that “Tenaris’ Notice of Dispute regarding TAVSA
was flawed because it failed to accept the Republic’s offer of consent given in the

Treaty with Luxembourg,” "4

thus constituting “an amendment to the Republic’s
consent offer.”!>> The Applicant contends that the Luxembourg BIT conditions the
offer to arbitrate to a six-month consultation period. An acceptance that rejects that
condition cannot be considered valid and thus cannot perfect the consent to
arbitrate. !°° It relies on its expert report, as well as on case law and on the analysis of
international law and the ICSID system. It argues that the reservation of the right to
start arbitration before a six-month settlement negotiation period “clearly contravenes
the design of the dispute settlement offer contained in the Belgium-
Luxembourg/Venezuela BIT” '*’ and has to be qualified as “lack of a corresponding

acceptance.” !°8

As to Tenaris-COMSIGUA, it states that “Claimants [sic] consent was not validly
given before the Republic’s Denunciation since it departed significantly from the

terms of the offer contained in the Treaty invoked.” !°°

172.

As to Talta-COMSIGUA, it states that — like with Tenaris-COMSIGUA — “‘it is not
possible to conclude that negotiations under the Treaties started before the
COMSIGUA Notification of December 2011.”'® As a general rule, as correctly
analyzed by the Republic’s expert before the Tribunal, the consent to (ICSID)
arbitration cannot be expressed before the expiry of the six-month amicable

settlement period.'®!

The Applicant asserts that by not taking these circumstances into consideration and
by thus “wrongly establishing the relevant facts, the Tribunal made a decision that is

beyond the scope of its jurisdiction.” !

2. The Respondents

The Respondents refute the Applicant’s argumentation and the assertion that the
Tribunal has established the facts wrongly. They argue that:
“Tt]he following two facts are relevant for present purposes: the Claimants
accepted Venezuela’s offer to arbitrate, and thus perfected consent, by
notices submitted to Venezuela between 2009 and 2011; and Venezuela
denounced the ICSID Convention on 24 January 2012. Thus, an agreement

to arbitrate between the Claimants and Venezuela existed before the
denunciation.”!®

The Respondents contend that these facts are established and not contested, and that
“Venezuela only disputes the /egal consequences flowing from those facts.” !®* Such
appraisal does not constitute an excess of power, as little so as the assessment of the
facts by the Tribunal. The Committee has no authority to reassess the Tribunal’s
findings on facts. Finally, “Venezuela does not even try to establish that the
Tribunal’s jurisdictional decision, even if wrong (which it is not), constitutes an

excess of powers that is manifest.” !°

173. The Committee has carefully studied the Award. It has not detected a non-application
of the applicable law nor a mishandling of the evidence that the Parties had presented

when establishing its competence, and thereby the jurisdiction of the Centre.

174. The Tribunal started its analysis and determination by quoting Convention Article 72
according to which the consent must be given or rather perfected before the
denunciation of the Convention since in investment arbitration “consent to arbitrate

is expressed consecutively.” !©°

175. It then identified, quoted and applied the relevant provisions in both the Luxembourg
and the Portugal BITs. Given the difference in their texts, and the factual
circumstances for each of the Claimants and their investments, the Tribunal structured

its analysis by distinguishing the different scenarios.

176. As to Tenaris-TAVSA, the Tribunal presented Venezuela’s position in
paragraphs 66-71 and Tenaris’ position in paragraphs 72-76 of the Award. In

paragraphs 77-91 of the Award, it presented its analysis and determination.

177. The Tribunal listed a string of uncontested communications and negotiations between
the Parties that took place between May 2009 and November 2011 in order to reach
an amicable settlement. It also referred to a Notice of Dispute dated 20 November

2009 which reads in the relevant part:

“The Luxembourg Treaty contains Venezuela’s consent to solve any
dispute through international arbitration, in particular before the
International Centre for the [sic] Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID). Tenaris and Tavsa LLC hereby also give their consent to resort to
arbitration in the unfortunate event the dispute could _not be settled
amicably.”'%7

 

178. The Tribunal took this Notice to mean that Tenaris perfected the consent to arbitrate
before ICSID. In the Committee’s mind, the text of the Notice is unambiguous and

the interpretation given by the Tribunal is understandable.

47

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 55 of 129

179. The Tribunal noted that Venezuela “seems to have abandoned the argument,” in the
Tenaris-TAVSA context, that “acceptance should have been submitted only after
negotiating in good faith for six months.”!® It therefore focused the debate on this
issue to the circumstances of Tenaris-COMSIGUA. The Committee is not in a

position to verify the Tribunal’s assumption.

180. The Committee notes, however, that the Applicant did not raise this specific issue in
the annulment proceeding. Rather, Venezuela contends that Tenaris’ acceptance was
flawed since it contained a reservation. The reservation was inconsistent with

Venezuela’s offer and could therefore not perfect the consent.!®

181. With respect to the latter query, the Tribunal quoted the reservation in the Award

which states:

“In this context, Tenaris and Tavsa LLC hereby reserve their right to file
for arbitration upon expiration of the six-month term [...] or even before
insofar as the Government’s behaviour shows the expiration of such term
is a mere formality deprived of all usefulness.”!”°

182. The Tribunal found, firstly, that Tenaris had never made use of the reservation, and
secondly, that it did not substantially modify the offer, “as by doing so Tenaris merely
subscribed to a principle accepted in investment arbitration and reflected in the

Luxembourg Treaty itself.”!7!

183. The Committee does not have to determine whether the Tribunal applied the
Luxembourg Treaty erroneously, although it finds that the reservation is not
substantively inconsistent with Venezuela’s standing offer to accept arbitration:
Article 9.1 provides that the parties shall endeavor as far as possible to settle the
dispute amicably. Tenaris’ declaration expresses the acceptance of the offer

unequivocally and states that it will conduct proceedings as legally prescribed. In any

event and for this reason, the Tribunal’s determination does not amount to a non-

application of the applicable law.

As to Talta-COMSIGUA, the Tribunal found that negotiations started in June 2010
and a Notice of Dispute was sent on 2 December 2011, i.e. before the date of
denunciation, when Talta-COMSIGUA expressed its consent to submit the dispute to
ICSID arbitration. It held that the consent was validly expressed and that the six-
month negotiation period had been completed since, according to Article VIII.2 of
the Portugal Treaty, it had started to run “from the beginning of these

consultations.” !7”

The Tribunal decided to postpone its final ruling until it had also determined whether

Tenaris, being a joint claimant in COMSIGUA, had equally given its consent.

The Tribunal determined that the situation for Tenaris-COMSIGUA was “more
complex” given the difference in wording between the Luxembourg and Portuguese

Treaties, !7°

The Tribunal displayed the Applicant’s and its expert’s positions in paragraphs 103
and 106-114, and the Respondents’ and their expert’s positions in paragraphs 104 and
115-121 of the Award.

It developed its analysis in paragraphs 122-151 of the Award in a delicate
appreciation of the experts’ opinions on the proper reading of Article 9 of the
Luxembourg Treaty. In reference to VCLT Article 31 and by weighing the text of the
Luxembourg Treaty, its context, purpose and object, as well as the overriding
requirement of good faith, the Tribunal concluded that “Article 9 of Luxembourg
Treaty (when correctly interpreted) allows the investor expressing its consent in

advance and, at the same time, declaring its choice for ICSID arbitration.” !74

Therefore, the Tribunal held that Talta’s and Tenaris’ Notice of Dispute dated 2
December 2011, and hence before Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID

Convention, which had chosen the ICSID procedure, completed the consent.

In an addendum, the Tribunal analyzed a number of cases that had been submitted by
Venezuela to evidence that the consent can only be completed after the negotiation

period and found these cases inconclusive. !”>

The Committee cannot but state that the Tribunal applied the relevant treaty and came
to reasonable conclusions for all constellations, i.e. for Tenaris-TAVSA, Talta-

COMSIGUA and Tenaris-COMSIGUA.

Therefore, the Committee determines that the Tribunal has not exceeded its powers
in its decision regarding the consent to arbitrate and will not have to examine the term
“manifest.” Accordingly, it rejects the Applicant’s request to annul the Award based

on this ground.

The Issue of Expropriation
i. Summary of the Parties’ Position
1. The Applicant

The Applicant contends that the Tribunal “manifestly exceeded its power by failing
to apply the applicable law, i.e. the Portugal BIT and customary rules of international

law.?176

It submits that the Tribunal initially confirmed that both the Luxembourg and the
Portugal Treaties had to be applied and that it analyzed them both “when addressing
many of the parties’ arguments on expropriation” but that it failed to do so when
considering the issue of compensation. Thereby, it overlooked Venezuela’s argument

that the Portugal BIT required only a suitable mechanism to ensure payment of

compensation, “and that lack of payment did not make a legal expropriation

illegal.”!””

195. Venezuela had put the question before the Tribunal whether it had violated Article [V

of the Portugal BIT. That question was not addressed, amounting to “a failure to apply

the proper law in a manifest excess of powers.” !7*

196. The Applicant admits that the Tribunal refers to the Portugal BIT when it presents

both BITs in its section on “The Lack of Payment” and states that:

“Prima facie the Arbitral Tribunal sits with Claimants: a delay of more than
seven years in the payment of compensation does not constitute
“immediate” payment, following the wording of art. IV of the Portugal
Treaty.”!”

However, that was “merely a prima facie expression that had to be addressed and

elaborated on by the Tribunal.” By failing to make a “conclusive determination” to

that effect, the Tribunal exceeded its power. 180

197. Instead of applying the Portugal BIT to the events concerning TALTA, the Tribunal

applied the Luxembourg BIT, which is not the applicable law with respect to an

allegedly Portuguese Claimant, and “any use of the Luxembourg Treaty as to Talta is

frivolous.” '*!

198. The Applicant extends its complaint to the non-application of customary international

law. It asserts:

“The Republic’s argument based on customary international law relied on
the fact that the BITs are the ones that provide for the application of such
rules as part of the applicable law. Therefore, applying customary
international law amounts to applying the proper law, i.e. the BITs.
Consequently, not applying customary international law means not
applying the proper law.”!*?

It insists that the Tribunal’s manifest excess of power is particularly blatant
since it did apply customary international law selectively, for instance in

connection with quantum. !*3

199. The Applicant relies on Sempra v. Argentina, where the ad hoc committee found that
the tribunal had exceeded its powers by applying — through Article 25 of the Draft
Articles on State Responsibility — customary international law, “rather than Article

XI of the BIT.”'* It argues:

“Tn the present case, the Tribunal did the opposite; i.e. it adopted the BIT
(not the Venezuela-Portugal Treaty) as the primary law to be applied, and
failed to apply the rules on customary international law on expropriation,
which indeed is part of the applicable law pursuant to the terms of the
BITs.”!8

2. The Respondents

200. The Respondents refute the Applicant’s argumentation. They contend that the
Tribunal did apply the Portugal BIT when finding that the non-payment for more than
seven years did not constitute immediate payment, following the wording of its
Article IV requirement. No extended analysis was needed and appropriate to come to
this conclusion. The succinctness of the reasoning does not amount to a non-

application of the norm but at best to a failure to state reasons.

201. The expression “prima facie” in paragraph 357 of the Award might be a “rather
strange coda” and the issue could “have been more felicitously expressed” but that
does not hinder the identification of the clear conclusion by the Tribunal that

Venezuela violated Article IV.1 of the Portugal BIT.!°°

202. Further, the Tribunal elaborated on the Luxembourg BIT because of its “more

permissive language.” In any event, the Applicant’s arguments do not relate to

COMSIGUA, since the TAVSA investment was covered by the Luxembourg BIT,

whose non-application is not alleged.'*”

With respect to the alleged non-application of customary international law, the
Respondents rely on the Vivendi I v. Argentina committee, which found that:
“[nJo doubt an ICSID tribunal is not required to address in its award every
argument made by the parties, provided of course that the arguments which
it actually does consider are themselves capable of leading to the conclusion

reached by the tribunal and that all questions submitted to a tribunal are
expressly or implicitly dealt with.”'**

They explain that the Tribunal had established under the Treaties that Tenaris and
Talta had been unlawfully expropriated and that there was no need to go any further
in its analysis. The Treaties were leges speciales that cannot be overridden by
customary law. By not taking it into consideration, the Tribunal expressed implicitly
that it gave primacy to the BITs. It did not have to reject the application of customary
law explicitly. In any event and where appropriate, the Tribunal did apply customary

international law.!*°

Finally, the Respondents assert that the non-application of the applicable law can only
be considered an excess of power when it is not applied in toto, which is not the case
here. Any other interpretation would amount to the unauthorized scrutiny of the

correct application of the law.!”

ii. The Committee’s Analysis and Determination

The Applicant alleges the non-application of two sets of legal norms: (i) the Portugal
BIT and (ii) provisions of customary international law. The Committee will address

both allegations separately.

With respect to the Portugal BIT, the Committee notes at the outset that the

Applicant’s allegation relates only to TaltaeCOMSIGUA’s expropriation. The

Applicant does not assert that the Tribunal did not apply the Luxembourg BIT, and
the issues connected to Tenaris’ investments in both TAVSA and COMSIGUA are
covered by the Luxembourg Treaty. Having argued that the Tribunal “only referred

to the Venezuela-Luxembourg Treaty,”!*!

the Applicant states without any
elaboration that “the Tribunal [...] failed to apply both.”!°? The Committee is unable

to follow the Applicant’s reasoning.

In addition, in the Committee’s view, the Tribunal has done more than just presenting

a “prima facie conclusion,” as alleged by the Applicant.!%*

It has opened its analysis on the issue of expropriation by quoting both Treaties in
their relevant parts. It concluded that “the Treaties” allow expropriations when they
meet certain requirements one of which is that they are “accompanied by provisions
that contemplate the payment of compensation [...] and payment thereof shall be
made without undue delay.” !** That is an interpretation of both BITs. It is not for this

Committee to delve into its correctness.

The Tribunal has reiterated the text of both Treaties when discussing the lack of
payment. It has concluded that the wording of Article IV of the Portugal BIT, which
requires that the “immediate, adequate and effective” payment of compensation must
be guaranteed (differently from the wording of Article 4 of the Luxembourg BIT),
has been violated. From there it has drawn the further conclusion that “a delay of
more than seven years in the payment of compensation does not constitute

“immediate” payment, following the wording of art. IV of the Portugal Treaty.”!°>

This is a reasoned conclusion in application of the Portugal BIT. The Applicant denies
this fact by arguing that the Tribunal itself had stated that it is only prima facie, which

should have been followed up by a more “conclusive determination.” !°°

211. The Committee does not have to entertain an analysis of the term “prima facie,” nor
whether the structure of paragraph 357 of the Award is linguistically appropriate.
However, it notes that “prima facie” precedes the Tribunal’s statement that it sides
with the Respondents. It refers to paragraph 356 of the Award where the Respondents
assert that Venezuela has breached Articles 4 and IV of both Treaties by not
compensating for the expropriation in the course of more than seven years.!°” It is not
evident that the definitional effects of the term may somehow be conditioned by the
following part of paragraph 357, which presents a succinct conclusion in application

of the Portugal BIT and introduces a debate of the Luxembourg BIT.

212. Be that as it may, the “conclusive determination” by the Tribunal is clear to the
Committee. The Tribunal has applied and interpreted Article IV of the Portugal BIT
in the preceding paragraphs of the Award and states the result of such interpretation
in paragraph 357. The fact that it continues its inquiry into the Luxembourg BIT
because of the different wording with respect to the lack of payment of Tenaris cannot
obscure the conclusions drawn from the application of the Portugal BIT with respect

to Talta.

213. In any event, the Committee has not found an indication that the Tribunal has made
use of the Luxembourg Treaty to determine the (un-)lawfulness of Talta’s

expropriation.

214. With respect to the alleged non-application of customary international law, the
Tribunal noted Venezuela’s position in this regard. However, it decided to base its
determination as to the unlawfulness of the expropriation due to the lack of

compensation in the Treaties. !°*

215. The Committee notes that both the Portugal and the Luxembourg Treaties provide in
Articles VII and 9, respectively, that tribunals have to apply the Treaties and

principles of international law. Does that mean that the Tribunal has to explicitly

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 63 of 129

quote each time both Treaties in their decision? The Committee does not believe so

for the following reason.

216. BITs and other treaties are Jeges speciales in relation to principles of international
law and, for that matter, customary international law (the distinction is of no relevance
in the present case). As such, they are able to derogate from the leges generales
contained in customary law to the extent that they are not of an imperative character,
as clearly expressed in VCLT Article 53. The rules on compensation are not of such

imperative character.

217. It would be unnecessary for a tribunal that has determined a legal issue based on a
treaty to address it through the prism of leges generales. To the extent that a
determination based on customary international law yielded a contradicting result, the
application of the treaty would take precedence and the examination of the customary
law would prove irrelevant and even incorrect. In this sense, principles of customary
international law are only relevant in circumstances where the treaty is obscure or

leaves gaps.

218. By mentioning Venezuela’s position in the Award but basing its decision on the
Treaties, the Tribunal has conformed itself to the structure of international law and
the provisions of Articles 9 and VII of the Luxembourg and Portugal Treaties,
respectively. Precisely, it has not failed to apply the provisions of customary
international law, since in light of both Treaties, those provisions are not applicable

to determine the lawfulness of the expropriation.

219. The Applicant relies in its argument on Sempra v. Argentina. However, the decision
supports the Committee’s findings. The ad hoc committee found that the tribunal had
applied customary international law where the BIT had provided otherwise, and had
made a fundamental error in determining that customary law “trumps” the BIT.!°?
That is perfectly in line with, and supports this Committee’s finding. When “[i]n the

present case the Tribunal did the opposite; i.e. it adopted the BIT (not the Venezuela-

'°9 Sempra v. Argentina, | 207.

Portugal Treaty) as the primary law to be applied, and failed to apply the rules on

+200

customary international law on expropriation, as submitted by the Applicant, the

Tribunal accepted the correct hierarchy.

220. For these reasons, the Committee rejects the request for annulment regarding the issue

of expropriation based on the ground of manifest excess of powers.

(2) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure
a. The Issue of Burden of Proof and Evidence
i. Summary of the Parties’ Position

1. The Applicant

221. The Applicant bases its request for annulment due to a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure on two assertions. Firstly, the Tribunal inverted the
burden of proof regarding the effective seat of Tenaris and Talta with the objective to
establish jurisdiction.”"! Secondly, the Tribunal “allowed the Claimants to introduce
evidence after the ‘closure of the files to the Parties’ which the Republic could not

examine during the Hearing.”?°?

222. With regard to the burden of proof, the Applicant asserts that the Tribunal had
concluded that Tenaris’ and Talta’s effective seat was Luxembourg and Portugal,
respectively, but not because the Respondents had discharged their burden of proof
to this effect. Rather, the Tribunal had “compared the evidence produced by
Claimants [...] with the evidence presented by the Republic in order to support the
Republic’s argument that Tenaris and Talta’s seat was Argentina [...]. In doing so,
the Tribunal disregarded the Claimants’ burden of proof and reversed it onto the
Republic.”?°? When assessing the evidence with respect to the relevant criteria for the
determination of the seat, i.e. the number of employees, the business operations and

the factual management, “the Tribunal considered not what had been effectively

demonstrated by Tenaris and Talta, but instead a balance of the scant evidence provided
by Claimants with the evidence produced by Venezuela to demonstrate that the seat was

in Argentina.”?"

In that vein, it argues that the Tribunal had concluded that:

- the effective seat was in Luxembourg and Portugal respectively because
Venezuela had not sufficiently supported its argument by evidence (which was
not its duty) that the seat was in Argentina,

- the effective seat corresponded to the statutory seat because Venezuela had failed
to prove (which was not its duty) that business contacts were made from
Argentina,

-  Talta was a holding company because Venezuela had failed to prove (which was
not its duty) that Talta carried out commercial activities of its own outside of its

statutory seat.2°°

With regard to the Tribunal’s allegedly untimely and procedurally inappropriate
permission for the Respondents to introduce new evidence at the “eleventh-hour,”?”°
the Applicant submits that the Tribunal exercised “a highly irregular procedural
misconduct that severely limited its right to defence and eroded its right to be
heard”?°? when it allowed Tenaris and Talta to submit documents evidencing the
location of the effective seat. It has thus re-opened the proceeding,”°* which it had

closed with respect to the submission of new evidence.?°

The Applicant refers to Arbitration Rule 38 and refutes its applicability at the time
when the Tribunal granted the Respondents the possibility to introduce new
documents. It states, “Arbitration Rule 38 refers to a situation in which the

proceedings have been already closed, which is not the situation here.”!°

At the same time, the Applicant alleges that the Tribunal had communicated to the
Parties that the files were closed after the hearings with respect to evidentiary
materials. That said, the Tribunal invited Tenaris and Talta more than a year later to
complete the evidence with respect to the effective seat by submitting redacted
documents which had been in the Respondents’ custody throughout the proceeding.
It had done so when it had realized that Venezuela’s argument as to the paucity of

evidence was pertinent.?!!

The Applicant affirms that it never had an opportunity to rebut this belated evidence
and to do so properly during a hearing. Equally, cross-examinations during the
hearing had relied on the evidence in the record and could not be extended to the new,
untimely documents. “Even though the Tribunal granted Venezuela the opportunity
to present its observations on Tenaris and Talta’s late submission, in accordance with
a calendar of pleadings agreed upon by the parties, the Republic’s rights had already

been damaged beyond repair.”?!”

In particular, the Tribunal did not grant the Republic “an opportunity to complete the
record or to add arguments or documents or to question those documents at a

hearing.”?!?

The Applicant relies on the decision in Fraport v. Philippines, where the ad hoc
committee had found that the tribunal’s reliance on evidence, which had been
produced after the hearing had taken place and thus could not be considered by the

experts, had violated a fundamental principle of procedure.?!*

and (ii) the Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the Tribunal had reversed the

burden at any occasion.

On the contrary, be it on the establishment of the effective seat, the quality of Talta
as a holding company, and on the coincidence of the statutory and effective seat, the
Tribunal has each time “analyzed the evidence presented by the Claimants and found
it to be probative and persuasive. The Tribunal then analyzed the Respondent’s

evidence and found it wanting.”?!©

The Respondents argue that, “[t]hat approach is entirely faithful to the principle that

it is for the party alleging a fact to demonstrate its existence.”?!”

They state that the Applicant’s arguments “are nothing more than a disagreement with
the Tribunal’s evidentiary determinations”, which are entirely in its discretion, and
that a corresponding reassessment of the evidence by the Committee is not covered
by its authority. Venezuela constantly confuses the burden of proof and the standard

of proof, which cannot be alleged to be a rule of procedure.!*

The Respondents have mustered the case law quoted by the Applicant and agree with
their “uncontroversial propositions that: (’) matters that are decisive for purposes of
establishing jurisdiction must be proven and cannot simply be assumed; and (ii) the
claimant bears the burden of proof on its jurisdictional allegations.” They contend,
however, that the Tribunal in the present case did hold Tenaris and Talta to their
burden of proof, did rely on evidence and not on assumptions and did find the

Respondents’ evidence persuasive.?!?

contend that the Tribunal acted within the scope of its competence because of the

following reasons.

Firstly, Convention Article 43 authorizes the Tribunal to request the production of
documents “at any stage of the proceedings” sua sponte. Moreover, Arbitration Rule
Al allows the Tribunal at any stage of the proceedings to decide whether the dispute
is within its competence and whether procedures related to jurisdictional objections
shall be oral or not. The Parties have the inalienable right to be heard but they do not

have the right to a hearing.”°

Contrary to Venezuela’s allegations, the Respondents argue that the documents only
complemented the substantial evidence that they had submitted before the hearing,

and the Tribunal relied on both.

Secondly, the Respondents assure that Venezuela had sufficient opportunity to
comment on the new documents and to submit documents of their own. It is
uncontested that the Parties had agreed on a schedule and page-limit for submissions,
that both Parties have submitted briefs in two rounds, and that Venezuela simply
chose not to add new evidence, together with the briefs. “What this history shows is
that all Parties received extensive due process in response to the Tribunal’s

request.”??!

The Respondents refute the Applicant’s reliance on Fraport v. Philippines because of
incomparability of the facts. In Fraport the tribunal accepted more than 1900 pages
of new evidence after the closing of the proceeding and relied on it without having
given the parties an opportunity to make submissions with respect to it.””? That is the

contrary of what happened in the present case as described above.

ii. The Committee’s Analysis and Determination

The Committee has carefully read Chapter V.2 of the Award. It disagrees with the
Applicant’s reading on the burden of proof because the Tribunal did not state what
the Applicant alleges. The Committee notes that the Tribunal first presented the
evidence submitted by the Respondents in detail, in paragraph 195 to 203 of the
Award, and did the same with Venezuela’s evidence, in paragraph 204 to 206. It then
proceeded to weigh this evidence. The Tribunal found the evidence adduced by

99223

Tenaris probative and convincing, contrarily to the Applicant that found it “scant.”*~

It is not for the Committee to question the Tribunal’s evaluation.

The Tribunal did not state a causal link between Venezuela’s insufficient evidence as
to Argentina being the effective seat but relied on Tenaris’ and Talta’s as well as on
Venezuela’s evidence. It concluded, after an extensive assessment in paragraphs 207-
230 of the Award, that “there is no evidence that Tenaris and Talta’s Effective Seat
are located in Argentina. On the contrary, the evidence points to the fact that the
Effective Seat is located in Luxembourg and Portugal, respectively.”?*4 To the
Committee’s mind, the Tribunal’s operation of balancing the factual allegations and
related evidence produced by all Parties, neither constitutes a reversal of the burden

of proof nor a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.

As to the presumption of a coincidence between the statutory and the effective seat
in Portuguese law, the Tribunal repeated the experts’ opinions to that effect, but did
not rely on the presumption because Venezuela had failed to prove that Talta’s
business was conducted from Argentina. Rather, the Tribunal continued, after having
stated the experts’ opinion, that “[t]he above having been said, the Tribunal has
thoroughly analyzed and assessed the evidence provided by the Parties, and it

concludes that it is not persuaded that Tenaris and Talta have their Effective Seat in

Argentina, and it understands that their Effective Seats coincide with the Statutory

Seats,”225

Again, the Committee does not find a reversal of the burden of proof.

As to the qualification of Talta as a holding or commercial company, the Tribunal did
not reach its conclusions because Venezuela had not submitted sufficient evidence
that it conducted commercial activities outside its statutory seat. Rather, it firstly
appraised the evidence presented by both Parties and found that this evidence pointed
to a qualification as a holding company, in disagreement with Venezuela’s expert’s
legal analysis of Portuguese law. Secondly, it did not pursue the legal analysis in
detail because it found that real activities as a holding company, and not the formal
legal qualification, to be decisive. As to the activities, it assessed the evidence
produced by Talta and found it probative. It is not the Committee's role to reassess

the evidence.

Again, the Committee does not find a reversal of the burden of proof.

In any event, the Committee recalls that the question of whether the principle of
burden of proof is a “fundamental rule of procedure” is still subject to debate. This is
even more so based on the fact that the reversal of the burden through the operation
of prima facie presumptions should also be part of such rule of procedure. As
developed in Section IV.A.2 of this Decision, the rules on the burden of proof provide
judges and arbitrators with a mechanism to solve situations of non liquet. To the
Committee’s mind, they are not concerned with fundamental procedural propriety

and justice.

For these reasons, the Tribunal did not violate a fundamental rule of procedure when

it assessed the evidence on the effective seats of Tenaris and Talta.

With respect to the Tribunal’s decision to allow new documents on shareholder and

board meeting into the record more than a year after the hearing but before the closure

of the proceeding in accordance with Arbitration Rule 38, the Committee believes

that the Tribunal did not breach due process.

In fact, wide experience shows that in the course of deliberations, additional issues of
fact and law arise that a conscientious tribunal will try to elucidate by reverting to the
parties. This precious option would be curtailed if a tribunal would have to re-open
the oral phase of the proceeding each time when asking for additional evidence. The
option to ask for additional evidence and give the parties an opportunity to comment
on it in writing fits the Convention’s and Arbitration Rules’ objective to grant wide
discretion to tribunals to conduct the proceeding, and to allow them in particular to

call upon parties to produce documents at any of its stages.

Therefore, the Tribunal had the authority to request the production of documents after
the hearings without conducting new oral hearings, as clearly established in

Arbitration Rule 41(4).

It is a different issue whether a tribunal violates a fundamental procedural rule and
due process if it does not afford the parties the opportunity to comment on the request
and on the new evidence. The Committee does not have to decide the question as a
matter of principle since the Tribunal had not only granted the Parties the opportunity
to comment but had sought and received the agreement of the Parties to this effect,
including a limitation of pages in two rounds of submissions. The Applicant was not

hindered to submit new evidence together with its briefs.

The circumstances are thus different from Fraport, where no such opportunity had

been granted.

The Committee does not have to decide the question of whether the Tribunal might
have bound itself to the extent that it “expressly declared the file closed as it pertains

to evidentiary materials.”??°

The Applicant refers to the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 3, dated 22 July 2015,
which reads in its paragraph 8, “the Tribunal will not accept any new documents [...]
without prior application and the Tribunal’s express permission.” Unambiguously,
the provision limits the rights of the Parties but not the exercise of procedural

discretion by the Tribunal.

In addition, the Committee notes that the Tribunal closed the proceeding only on 15

November 2016.27

Therefore, the Tribunal did not violate a fundamental rule of procedure when it called
upon Tenaris and Talta to supplement its evidence on the shareholder and board

meetings in the course of its deliberations more than a year after the hearing.

The Issue of the Valuation Date of Damages

In its Memorial, the Applicant asserts that the Tribunal “seriously departed from a
fundamental rule of procedure in its decision on damages, particularly as it pertains

to the valuation date adopted for the calculation of the amount of compensation.”??*

During the Hearing, the Applicant affirmed that it was not pursuing a request to annul
the Award because the Tribunal departed from a rule of procedure when determining
the date for the valuation of damages.” In its Post Hearing Brief, the Applicant
reiterates in one heading that the “tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule
of procedure and failed to state grounds for its findings on damages and costs,” but
argues exclusively on the lack of reasons for the determination of the valuation date,

without mentioning the ground of Convention Art. 52(1)(d).?°°

In light of the Applicant’s affirmation during the hearing and the complete lack of
argument on a departure from a procedural rule, the Committee will not entertain the

initial request.

The Issue of an Increase of Compensation Awarded to COMSIGUA
i. Summary of the Parties’ Position
1. The Applicant

The Tribunal calculated the amount of compensation for COMSIGUA’s
expropriation by using the DCF method first and then up-grading it after an analysis
of alternative approaches such as the ‘market multiples approach’ and the
‘comparable transactions approach’. The alternative approaches had been introduced

by the Parties’ experts.?*!

The Applicant criticizes the method and the result of the calculation and asserts an
annullable misconduct of the Tribunal it failed to state reasons for this decision to
increase the amount of compensation. It has based its argument predominantly on an

232

alleged lack of reasons.**- This issue will be addressed at a later stage and in the

appropriate context.

However, at the end of respective chapters in its submissions, the Applicant contends

that:

“[iJn addition to failing to provide reasons for this holding, the Tribunal
seriously departed from fundamental rules of arbitral procedure. This is so
because the Tribunal’s subjective, unwarranted, unjustified increase of
value was never even presented as a possibility by or to the Parties as part
of their respective exchanges with the Tribunal.”?**

The Applicant devotes paragraphs 259-262 of its Memorial and paragraph 230 of its
Reply to the issue. It argues that the Parties or their experts had never requested the
blending of several methods of calculations and that the experts were never given the
chance to address them. The Applicant was thus deprived of its right to be heard and

the Tribunal acted “extra petita.”

2. The Respondents

The Respondents contend that the Applicant misrepresents the proceeding. The
different valuation methods were introduced and widely discussed by the Parties and
their experts. The Parties had invited the Tribunal to base its calculation “on a number
of different methods presented by the Parties.”?** Thereby, the Parties had set the
legal framework, the Tribunal being free to reach its own conclusions, as it is well

established in case law.?*°

They submit that it is equally well established since the Chorzéw Factory case that a
tribunal may estimate the value of the damage by several methods, including, if
necessary, by way — in the words of the Court — “of completing the results of the one

by those of the others.”?*°

The Respondents summarize their argument by stating:

“Tt cannot seriously be suggested that the Tribunal denied Venezuela the
right to be heard when the Tribunal adopted valuation methodologies that
had been presented and debated at length by the Parties and their quantum
experts. It was well within the Tribunal’s power to decide not to pick one
approach or the other, but instead to adopt a hybrid approach based on the
arguments and evidence presented by the parties.”?°’

ii. The Committee’s Analysis and Determination

Before arriving at its own analysis and determination of the amount of compensation,
the Tribunal presented the Respondents’ proposed methods of calculation of
COMSIGUA’s value. They are various, although preferably based on the DCF
method.?** Thereafter, the Tribunal presented the Applicant’s methods of calculation.

They are equally various, with the expert not opposing the DCF method but preferring

a compared transaction approach.”*? None of the Parties insist that one or the other

method is exclusive and the Applicant does not allege so.

The Award presents the parameters and numbers in detail. The Tribunal based its
conclusions on these parameters and numbers. None of them were unknown to the

Parties.

The Tribunal stated that it “finds no reason to depart from the traditional DCF
method” but that nothing prevents it “from contrasting the value obtained with other

approaches.”4?

The Applicant does not contradict the Tribunal’s statement. It does not allege that
international law obliges a tribunal to use a specific methodology. However, it seems
to assert that the Tribunal was hindered to combine methods to arrive at a fair market
value if the Parties had not made a petition in that sense. If that were the assertion,
the Committee rejects it. The choice of methodology to determine the fair market
value is the prerogative of the tribunal. It does not depend on a “petition” by either

party in that sense.

Tribunals read and hear the Parties’ and experts’ opinions. They appraise the material
in deliberation and come to conclusions based on this material, which is at the same
time the frame of reference. They have discretion to arrange and systematize it, as
long as they do not rely on new material, which has not been before the Parties. That
is not a “fiat” of a tribunal“! but the result of a reasoned process. No procedural rule
exists that obliges tribunals or courts to present (interim) deliberation findings to the

parties and allow them to provide “input from the Parties or their experts.”

272. Therefore, the Committee cannot conclude that the Tribunal has departed from a rule
of procedure when it contrasted the DCF method with other methods to calculate the

fair market value of COMSIGUA.

d. The Issue of Tax Indemnity
i. Summary of the Parties’ Position
1. The Applicant

273. On5 August 2016, i.e. almost a year after the Parties’ written pleadings, the Tribunal
sent a letter to the Parties informing them that during its deliberations it had discussed
the potential relevance of Article 5 of the Luxembourg BIT for the issue of taxation
of possible compensation, and that the Parties had not referred to this Article in their
pleadings. It invited the Parties to comment on the norm, which both Parties did in

post-hearing submissions.7?

274. The Applicant submits that this conduct of the Tribunal violated a fundamental rule
of procedure “not because they were not heard about the point, but rather from the
fact that the Tribunal added a new item of claim — including the normative source in

the articles of the Venezuela-Luxembourg BIT to those that were the subject of the

92:

Parties written and oral submissions.”?* In other words, “it incorporated into its

decision a line of argument that was absent from the Parties’ pleadings”?*>, thus

venturing “extra petita.”**°

275. The Applicant opines that the Tribunal was “constrained by the way by which the

Parties had decided to unfold the debate,”?4” although it admits that the Tribunal is

“not restricted to mere repetition to allegations of the Parties.”

23 This is undisputed between the Parties: Memorial, {{{{ 263-268; Counter-Memorial, 63.

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 77 of 129

276. By giving “Claimants the line of normative argument that they had not developed

ar?
before”?

and by allowing them to supplement their legal argument, the Tribunal
affected the “equality of arms as a fundamental rule of procedure”, because on other
occasions it had not allowed Venezuela to add to its argument when it was allegedly
insufficient.?°° Tenaris and Talta “had the burden of proof to establish the jurisdiction

of the Tribunal and to support its assertion, both legally and factually.”?>!

277. A reference to Article 43 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 34 is of no avail,
since “the text of these rules cited refer to evidentiary material [...] and does not refer
to legal sources and argument.” The provisions do not “allow for any kind of
supplementary legal arguments to be introduced by the Tribunal at any stage in the

proceedings.”?>

2. The Respondents

278. The Respondents argue that the Applicant’s assertions are deficient for a number of

reasons.

279. Firstly, they submit that the Tribunal had based its decision on the tax issue on Article
4(2) of the Luxembourg BIT and V(1)(c) of the Portugal BIT, i.e. on the proper
definition of compensation for expropriation, and that Article 5 “was ultimately
irrelevant to the Tribunal’s conclusion.” Therefore, “Venezuela’s argument cannot

satisfy Article 52(1)(d).”?3

280. Secondly, it is uncontested that Venezuela made extensive submissions on the issue
and was thus sufficiently heard. There is “no substance to the claimed denial of due

process.”?>4 Furthermore, the Respondents clarify that the tax indemnity pretense was

not introduced after the Tribunal’s request for comments on Article 5 of the

Luxembourg BIT, but had instead been part of the arbitration from the beginning.”

Thirdly, nothing hinders a tribunal to ask parties to argue a point that it finds to be
potentially relevant during deliberations and “to address the relevance or irrelevance
of a provision of a legal instrument, where that instrument has already formed the

basis for the Parties’ arguments.”?>°

ii. The Committee’s Analysis and Determination

The Committee recalls that the totality of the Venezuela-Luxembourg BIT was
introduced into the record. It is part of the applicable law by agreement of the Parties.
By discussing a specific article of the BIT, the Tribunal did not introduce a new

normative source.

The Committee does not have to decide whether the parties to a dispute are free to
agree that one specific provision of a generally applicable international treaty such as
a BIT may be declared inapplicable. Even if so, it would be a very unusual situation
and would have to be declared explicitly by the parties. The Committee disagrees
with the Applicant’s opinion that “the way in which the Parties decided to unfold the
debate” can be considered an agreement on implied terms constraining the Tribunal
in its right and duty to apply the applicable law, i.e. the BIT, in its totality.>” This is
all the more so under the present circumstances, where Tenaris made its disagreement
to the non-applicability explicitly known through its post-hearing submission on

Article 5, even if that submission came a year after other submissions.

The Committee agrees with the Applicant that the issue of interpretation of Article 5
of the BIT is not one of “evidentiary material” but one of “legal arguments.”?°* It
follows from there that the absence or presence of arguments in this respect are not

issues of evidence and (burden of) proof, as alleged by the Applicant.**? Such issues

necessarily relate to facts and not to the interpretation of law. Certainly, parties to a
dispute have the duty to substantiate their case and to present legal argument. At the
end, however, iura novit curia: it is the tribunal that knows the law, and it has the

authority and duty to apply it irrespective of the parties’ positions.

The Applicant alleges that the Tribunal privileged Tenaris and Talta and disfavoured
Venezuela because repeatedly “faulting the Republic for not having fostered

sufficient support for its position and, thus, deciding in favour of the Claimants.”

The Committee has carefully read the Award, in particular paragraphs 80, 205, 208,
211, 213, 215, 220, 225, 228, 230, 361, 365, 546, and 872 where the Tribunal,
according to the Applicant, demonstrates such a violation of the procedural principle
of equality of arms. It has found that in all the paragraphs quoted, the Tribunal finds
on the evidence of facts. The Committee has not found any indication where the
Tribunal has dismissed any of Venezuela’s defenses by determining that its legal

argument was absent or poorly developed.

Tenaris’ petitum was a compensation for damages for expropriation free of
Venezuelan taxes and not for the correct application of the BIT. Therefore, the
Tribunal’s decision to ascertain Tenaris’ claim for compensation based on Articles 4
and 5 of the BIT cannot be described as “extra petita” as proposed by the

Applicant.2°!

The arbitral tribunal is under no fundamental procedural duty to search for the parties’
opinion on one or the other legal issue that emerges only during deliberations, after
the hearings and parties’ submissions, as long as it remains within the frame of the
applicable law. It may be considered part of its nobile officium to do so. However,
under the present circumstances the Committee does not have to venture into this
problem since, in fact, the Tribunal did invite the Parties to comment on Article 5 of
the BIT. It is evident that it was only able to put the question before the Parties when

it had come up during deliberations. Any other conclusion would limit the

competence of the Tribunal inappropriately and hinder it to accomplish its duty to

solve the dispute in application of the applicable law.

289. Therefore, the Applicant’s request to annul the Award for an alleged violation of a
fundamental rule of procedure because the Tribunal had invited the Parties to make
submissions on Article 5 of the Venezuela-Luxembourg BIT after the hearings and

other submissions is rejected.

The Issue of the Tribunal’s Decision on Costs
i. Summary of the Parties’ Position

1. The Applicant

290. As to the Tribunal’s decision on costs, in its Memorial, the Applicant devotes
paragraphs 285 and 286 to the issue of a violation of a fundamental rule of
proceeding. In its Reply, the Applicant repeats the headline of the respective section
but chooses not to elaborate its thoughts in the text. During the Hearing, the Applicant

confirmed its reasoning of the Memorial.”
291. The Applicant contends that the Tribunal:

“also committed a serious departure from fundamental rules of arbitral
procedure. This is so because the Republic never got the chance during the
proceeding to address the standard eventually applied by the Tribunal, even
though the Parties were requested to file separate simultaneous submissions
dealing only with the costs of the proceedings.

Hence, the Tribunal failed to provide the Republic with an opportunity to
be heard on this issue and defend itself, irrespective of whether the Tribunal
would end up upholding or not the Republic’s arguments on the matter. The
Tribunal had the duty to abide by the Republic’s fundamental due process
rights, not taking a decision based on criteria that were not the object of
debate between the Parties during the proceedings and, thus, without
granting the Republic the opportunity to be heard on the matter.”?°

292. The Applicant relies on a general statement in Tidewater v. Venezuela, where the ad

hoc committee held that “[t]he right to be heard and to present one’s case is one of

the fundamental principles of due process. Its violation is a serious departure from a

fundamental rule of procedure.”?**

2. The Respondents

The Respondents assert that the Tribunal had invited the Parties to develop their views
on the allocation of costs in post-hearing briefs. Both Parties did so. “There is
therefore no basis to Venezuela’s complaint that it did not have the opportunity to

make submissions on the allocation of costs.”

Moreover, Article 61.2 Convention confers broad discretion on tribunals to apportion
costs. They “are under no obligation to submit to the parties an advance draft of their

costs submissions [...] for comment.”?°°

In any event, the Applicant has chosen not to rebut to the Respondents’ arguments in

its Reply. Its request “may therefore be taken as abandoned.”?67

ii. The Committee’s Analysis and Determination

The Committee notes that it is uncontested between the Parties that the Tribunal
afforded them the opportunity to submit their views on the allocation of costs in post

hearing briefs and that they made use of this opportunity.

The Tribunal has presented the Parties’ positions on that issue in paragraphs 832-836
of the Award. In paragraphs 837-856 the Tribunal has developed its determination,

not without referring again to the Parties’ positions.

In light of these steps and considerations undertaken by the Tribunal and of its
uncontestable discretion to allocate costs, the Committee does not see an indication

that may be interpreted as a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.

299. Therefore, the Committee rejects the Applicant’s request to annul the Award because

of an alleged violation of a procedural rule.

(3) Failure to State Reasons
a. The Issue of the Claimants’ Seats
i. Summary of the Parties’ Positions
1. The Applicant

300. The Applicant asserts that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its assumption
that Tenaris and Talta had their seat in Luxembourg and Portugal respectively and
that its conclusions were contradictory. The Applicant has put forward most of the
arguments together with its contentions on an erroneous application of law and an
excess of power. Under the present Section, the Committee only summarizes the

arguments to the extent that they have not been presented in Sections IV.A | and 2.

301. Firstly, the Tribunal “dismissed the Republic’s contention that Tenaris was run from
Argentina and Italy and that most of its employees were also there”? by holding

that:

“(t]he argument is devoid of force since the (large number) of Argentine
workers are hired by Siderca, an Argentine subsidiary of Tenaris, and not
by Tenaris itself. The fact that a subsidiary with legal status of its own,
located in Argentina, has a large number of employees, is irrelevant for the
purposes of determining where the Effective Seat of its headquarters is
located.”?©

However, when the Tribunal had to determine the scope of the nationalization

decree, it argued in “direct contradiction” with the foregoing that it:

“has no doubt that Comsigua was an affiliate of Sidor because, as put by
Respondent itself, “affiliates” are companies that have the same parent, and,
in this case, Comsigua was an affiliate of Sidor, as it belongs to Tenaris and
Sidor to Ternium, and both Tenaris and Ternium are a part of the Techint
group — their final and common owner.”?”°

302.

303.

304.

305.

The Applicant argues that the Tribunal treated the issue of ultimate ownership
differently where it “should have applied the same criteria to both matters, but instead,

it took the opposite direction resulting in a manifest, critical contradiction.”*”!

Secondly, the Tribunal has taken the view that Tenaris’ and Talta’s accounts are
audited by Luxembourgian and Portuguese auditing companies, and that this fact
indicates that their effective seats were in Luxembourg and Portugal, respectively. In
reality, the Applicant contends, these uncontested facts are but a “mere consequence
of compliance with the legal requirement of the place of incorporation and, as such,
they are irrelevant for purposes of determining the effective seat of a company. The
Tribunal blatantly failed to state reasons as to why simply meeting a requirement of

Luxembourgish law was relevant to the determination of Tenaris’ siége social.”?”"

The Applicant advances a similar argument with respect to the shareholder meetings:
the fact that “they were held in Luxembourg is just a manifestation of Tenaris being

incorporated there. It merely supports the fact that Tenaris’ statutory seat is located

in Luxembourg”?” but not the effective seat.

Thirdly, the Applicant presents as “an egregious example of inconsistent
reasoning”?”+ the Tribunal’s way of determining the status of Talta : although it had
conceded that Talta might not meet the legal requirements to be considered a holding
company instead of a commercial company, it based its appreciation of the facts
indicating the effective seat such as office space and business contacts with third
parties on criteria that are only appropriate for holdings.””> This is “a clear-cut failure

to state reasons.””°

2. The Respondents

The Respondents submit that the Tribunal has given extensive reasons for its
conclusion that the effective seats of Tenaris and Talta were Luxembourg and

Portugal, respectively, and that these reasons were free of contradictions.

They argue that “Venezuela’s claim is not that the Tribunal failed to state reasons, or
stated contradictory or inadequate reasons, but that the Tribunal adopted the wrong
reasons. That is not a basis for annulment.”?’’ Specifically, according to the
Respondents, “[i]n reality, Venezuela’s argument is not that the Tribunal failed to
state reasons. Rather, Venezuela takes issue with the Tribunal’s assessment of the

evidence.”?”8

They submit that the Tribunal had found that the effective seat was decisive for the
determination of the companies’ nationality, and that it had developed, after
extensively hearing both Parties’ experts on the issue, the criteria to define the
effective seat. On this basis, it had appraised the evidence presented by the Parties
and had come to reasoned and consistent conclusions. Venezuela now complains that
the Tribunal had found Tenaris’ and Talta’s evidence more convincing than

Venezuela’s. However, it is not for an ad hoc committee to reassess the evidence.?”?

With respect to the ultimate ownership of the Respondents by the Techint Group, the

Respondents assert that:

“[t]here is no contradiction in recognizing that (i) for the purposes of
expropriation, a nationalization decree can (and in this case did) cover an
entire group such as the Techint Group, and (ii) for the purposes of
jurisdiction, neither the Techint Group nor its Argentine subsidiary Siderca
were claimants in the arbitration, so the location of their employees and
legal seats were irrelevant in determining the effective seats of the
Claimants.”?*°

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 85 of 129

ii. The Committee’s Analysis and Determination

In Section IV.B.1.a, the Committee has already determined that the Tribunal had not
exceeded its powers by finding that Tenaris and Talta had their effective seats in

Luxembourg and Portugal, respectively, and that it had jurisdiction ratione personae.

It has come to this conclusion after having examined the reasons presented by the

Tribunal.

The Tribunal presented the following line of reasoning. In a first step — point A, it
identified the legal provisions in the ICSID Convention and in the BITs that determine
the issue of nationality and seat of a juridical person. It concluded that all provisions
required an effective seat rather than the statutory seat to be present, thus following

Venezuela’s arguments.

It then — point B — determined the criteria for such effective seat after an appraisal of
the “experts in Luxembourgian and Portuguese Law introduced by both Parties” as
(i) the place of the shareholders’ and the board of directors’ meetings, “the venue
being of relevance”, (ii) the place of management and (iii) the place where the

company’s books are maintained and kept.7*!

In a further step — point C -, the Tribunal applied the evidence to the criteria, which

was a logical consequence, in paragraphs 195-230 of the Award.

With respect to the specific contentions formulated by the Applicant, the Tribunal

held and concluded in this exercise — point D -:

- That “for the purposes of determining where the effective seat of its headquarters
is located”, the number of employees in a subsidiary is irrelevant. The Tribunal
has formed an opinion to that specific issue. For a different issue, i.e. the question
of whether the Nationalization Decree extended to all members of the Techint
Group, including to its subsidiaries, the Tribunal has come to a different

conclusion. The Committee is convinced that it is not contradictory when a

281 Award, 4 192-195.

78

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 86 of 129

Tribunal reasons differently for different issues. It disagrees with the Applicant
when it opines that the same criteria must be applied for different matters.”°? The
reason for establishing the effective seat and the reason determining the scope of
an expropriation decree do not wipe each other out but co-exist.

- That Talta was a holding and not a commercial company. It has come to this
conclusion by rejecting, with reasons and based on evidence, the Applicant’s
expert’s different opinion, and by reasoning that the formal characterization of
Talta in the registry was of less relevance for the determination of the effective
seat than its substantive activity, where the evidence shows “that Talta’s activity
is limited to the holding of interests in other companies.””*? The reasoning is
detailed and the Committee will not venture into a reassessment of the evidence,
which would be beyond its authority.

- That both Respondents’ books were audited and kept in Luxembourg and
Portugal, respectively. The Applicant’s argument that the Tribunal should have
explained why it chose that criterion to determine the effective seat is
inappropriate, as much so as the other one according to which it must be explained
why the venue of shareholder meetings may be taken into consideration. As noted
by the Committee, the Tribunal has explained, after an appraisal of the experts’
opinion, that a number of cumulative criteria were relevant to determine the
effective seat, one of which is the place of the shareholders’ meetings and the
place of auditing. It has evaluated these criteria collectively and stated that they
all converged to allow the conclusion that the effective seat of Tenaris was
Luxembourg and that the effective seat of Talta was Portugal. The Committee
cannot but state that the Tribunal has developed these thoughts and conclusions

in a reasoned manner.

316. Insum, the Committee sees no problem to follow the Tribunal’s reasoning from point

A - the identification of the problem — to point D — the conclusion — and finds it not

contradictory in and of itself. Therefore, it rejects the Applicant’s request to annul the

Award for a failure to state reasons.

The Issue of the Consent to Arbitrate
i. Summary of the Parties’ Positions
1. The Applicant

317. The Applicant contends that the Tribunal, in addition to exceeding its powers when
assuming that the consent to arbitrate was perfected before Venezuela’s denunciation
of the ICSID Convention (as discussed in Section IV.B.1.a), also failed to state the

reasons for its decision.

318. With respect to the dispute over Tenaris’ expropriation of its investment in TAVSA,
the Applicant submits that its expert had presented a profound opinion on Article 9
of the Luxembourg BIT, backed by solid case law, according to which TAVSA’s

Notice of Dispute, dated 20 November 2009, was defective.?**

319. Instead of accepting Venezuela’s standing offer contained in the BIT, the Notice
amended the offer by a reservation of rights to initiate ICSID arbitration proceedings
at any time. The Tribunal, the Applicant submits, ignored “the abundance of legal
arguments and supporting legal authorities.” It expressed its decision “in just one
paragraph,” without referring or analyzing Venezuela’s arguments or explaining “the
logical steps followed to reach its conclusion.” It did not address the issue of futility
of consultations and the notion why they must only be conducted to the extent
possible. The Applicant finds even “more troublesome for the validity of the Award
that the Tribunal did not explained [sic] why a reservation of the right to provide
consent to arbitration was, in fact, an exercise of that right. Even more, the Tribunal

expressly recognized that such reservation was never used.”

320. Although the Applicant agrees that “tribunals do not have an obligation to address in

detail every single assertion in support of an argument presented by the parties, if they

do not address one question that is relevant for understanding its reasoning, they have
the obligation to give reasons for not doing so.”?*° The Applicant relies on Libananco

v. Turkey, where the ad hoc committee stated:

“lack of consideration of a question submitted to a tribunal could amount
to a failure to state reasons if no reasons are given by the tribunal for not
addressing the question and such question would be determinant for
understanding the reasoning of the award.”?*”

321. With respect to the claims concerning COMSIGUA, the Applicant asserts that again
the Respondents did not accept Venezuela’s standing offer to arbitrate before the
denunciation of the BIT since it departed significantly from that standing offer, and
because it could not accept the offer before the period of consultation had elapsed,
i.e. before 2 June 2012. Although Venezuela has presented abundant arguments for

this opinion, the Tribunal failed to address them.?88

322. The Applicant further alleges that the Tribunal contradicted itself when it confirmed
on the one hand that in accordance with the Luxembourg BIT six months have to
elapse between the notice of a dispute and its submission, and held on the other hand
that “it was preferable to interpret the Luxembourg Treaty as allowing an investor to

99289

give at the same time its notice of dispute as well as its consent to arbitration.

2. The Respondents

323. The Respondents submit that the Tribunal has devoted “18 pages and over 100

+9290

paragraphs’ of reasons to the issue of whether the consent was perfected and that

“those reasons may easily be followed from point A to point B.”?*! In light of the
Tribunal’s approach, Venezuela cannot demonstrate that it failed to state reasons or

that it argued in a contradictory manner. In reality, Venezuela tries to re-argue the

case and have its expert’s opinion prevail, although the Tribunal had rejected his

we 2
argumentations in a well-reasoned way.”

324. The Respondents argue that the Tribunal did not have to follow a “minimum word
requirement””’? to present its conclusions, but that it has to provide reasons that can
be followed, and that it did not have to address every argument submitted by
Venezuela explicitly, but had to consider and treat them implicitly. That is what the

Tribunal did."

325. In particular, the Respondents assert that the Tribunal has carefully taken the different
wording of the Venezuela-Luxembourg and the Venezuela-Portugal BIT into account
and has interpreted them in thoroughly appraising the expert opinions presented by

both Parties.

326. Specifically, with respect to TALTA’s consent to arbitration regarding COMSIGUA,
the Respondents sustain that the Tribunal incurred in no contradiction when it applied
a different treatment to Talta-Comsigua and Tenaris-Comsigua to determine the date
of beginning of negotiations. Precisely, the difference responded to the different
language of each applicable BIT. 7°

327. After a careful reasoning, it has rejected the opinion of the Applicant’s expert and
agreed to the opinion of the Respondents’ expert. It submits that with respect to
TAVSA, “the Tribunal explained and supported its decision that Tenaris could perfect
consent with its notice of arbitration before the negotiation period in the Luxembourg
Treaty had elapsed; and the Tribunal similarly explained why the reservation of rights
to resort to arbitration prior to the exhaustion of that period did not change the

Tribunal’s conclusion.”?°°

The Respondents further submit that the Tribunal has distinguished in a reasoned way
between the consent and the initiation of arbitration and has explained that the consent
could precede the initiation.””’ The clear and consistent reasoning led the Tribunal to
decide that consent can be perfected before (the end of) consultations, while the
submission of the dispute to arbitration is only admissible after the period of

consultations has elapsed.”

ii. Committee’s Analysis and Determination

In Section IV.B.1.b, the Committee has already determined that the Tribunal did not
exceed its powers by finding that the consent to arbitrate was perfected before
Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention, and that it had jurisdiction

ratione temporis.

It has come to this conclusion after having examined the reasons presented by the
Tribunal. The Tribunal developed its reasoning and conclusions in paragraphs 59-151

of the Award.

Given Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal started by
stating in paragraphs 59-64 of the Award that according to Convention Article 72, the
consent must have been given before such denunciation, i.e. before 24 January 2012.
In light of the circumstantial differences and the different wording in the applicable
BITs, the Tribunal stated in paragraph 65 of the Award that “[e]ach Claimant’s case

and its investment shall be discussed separately.”?°

Consistently with the introductory remarks, the Tribunal continued to analyze
Tenaris-TAVSA’s, Talta;COMSIGUA’s and Tenaris-COMSIGUA’s conduct,
communications, and expression of consent to ICSID arbitration, and subsumed them

under the two applicable BITs.

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 91 of 129

As to Tenaris-TAVSA, after having exposed the Parties’ positions and scrutinized
numerous letters, minutes of meetings, and the Notice of Dispute, all dated between
May 2009 and November 2011, the Tribunal concluded that “the settlement period of
six months from the Tenaris and Tavsa Notice of 20 November 2009 had long ago

elapsed” when Venezuela denounced the Convention.

As already explained in Section IV.B.1.b of this Decision, the Tribunal found that the
Notice, by which they “give their consent to resort to arbitration” under the ICSID
Convention” shows a “perfect consistency between the terms of the offer to arbitrate

and the terms of Tenaris’ acceptance.”7°!

The Committee does not find a failure to state reasons in this sequence of arguments.

Once the consent was established, the Tribunal addressed the issue of reservation of
rights contained “in the final part of the phrase following Tenaris’ consent,”*°? which
according to the Applicant modifies the offer and thereby disqualifies the Notice as a
valid acceptance. Firstly, the Tribunal stated that Tenaris did observe the six-month
consultation period and thus, did not make use of the reserved right. Nevertheless, it
then found that “the inclusion of this reservation would not have substantially

modified the offer.”>°

The Committee has no difficulty to follow the Tribunal’s reasoning: it found that the
consent was expressed unequivocally and that the reservation of rights was not meant

to alter its content.

In light of the particular evidence in Tenaris-TAVSA, the Tribunal did not consider
the need to address Venezuela’s expert opinion. That cannot be interpreted as a
general unwillingness of the Tribunal to take the expert opinion into consideration.

The contrary is convincingly documented by the fact that in the different factual

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 92 of 129

circumstances of Tenaris-COMSIGUA, it presented and analyzed this opinion in

detail.**

Therefore, the Committee is unable to find a lack of reasoning when the Tribunal

addressed the Applicant’s arguments in the context where they were crucial.

As to Talta-COMSIGUA, the Tribunal based its reasoning on the text of Article VIII

of the Portugal BIT, which does not require a notice of dispute.*°>

The Tribunal reconstructed the “chronology of events,” starting from a first request
to negotiate dated 28 June 2010, including a Notice of Dispute of 2 December 2011
that contains an expression of consent to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration, and
ending with the request for arbitration, dated 20 July 2012, i.e. four days before
Venezuela’s denunciation became effective on 24 July 2012.*° In light of these
unambiguous statements and reference to uncontested dates, the Committee rejects
the Applicant’s allegation that the Tribunal did not take the beginning of negotiations

into account.>””

The Committee has no difficulty to follow the Tribunal’s reasoning to its “point B”,
where it stated that “[t]he facts are clear: when Talta sent the Comsigua Notice, it had
already complied with its obligation to negotiate for six months (and, by then,
Venezuela had not yet denounced the Convention). Therefore, Talta validly perfected
its consent to arbitrate when it sent the Comsigua Notice on 2 December 2011, prior

to the Denunciation.”>

As to Tenaris-COMSIGUA, the Tribunal found the situation “more complex”
because the Luxembourg BIT differs from the one with Portugal: point A.*°?
Therefore — and the Committee has no reason to criticize the approach — it devotes

some fifty paragraphs to the specific factual and legal circumstances in order to

establish whether Tenaris had perfected the consent to arbitrate before the

denunciation date.*!°

Both Parties have presented reports by prominent experts on this issue, reaching
contradictory conclusions. The Tribunal presented and analyzed these reports in
detail. It re-quoted the relevant provision of the Luxembourg BIT, referred to VCLT
Article 31 and presented its own interpretation in accordance with the ordinary
meaning of Article 9 of the BIT as well as its context, object and purpose, each time
referring back to the experts’ opinions. In conclusion, the Tribunal determined that
“Article 9 of the Luxembourg Treaty (when correctly interpreted) allows the investor
expressing its consent in advance and, at the same time, declaring its choice for ICSID
arbitration.”*!! In an appendix to this conclusion, the Tribunal discussed a number of
decisions which had been cited by the experts and found after an analysis that they
were “actually irrelevant as they do not deal with what is actually fundamental” with

the case at hand.?!?

The Committee finds the Tribunal’s reasoning clear, detailed, and consistent, and

followed it easily from point A to point B.

It has not found a contradiction in paragraph 136 of the Award, as alleged by the

Applicant. Paragraph 136 reads in its relevant part:

“Article 9.2 of the Treaty provides that, after the mandatory notification of
a dispute, the investor shall have six months to submit the dispute to any
forum of its choice [...]. However, the Treaty does not include any
prohibition that prevents an investor, at the time of notification of dispute,
from expressing its consent and choose arbitration. There is also no
indication whatsoever that negotiations should be deemed a condition
precedent for the effectiveness of consent.”

The Committee agrees with the Respondents: the paragraph differentiates between

the submission of the dispute to arbitration, which is only admissible after the lapse

of the consultation period, and the perfection of the consent, which — in the reasoned

opinion of the Tribunal — the claimant investor can express before.

348. Inconclusion, the Committee holds that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons when
accepting that the consent to arbitrate was perfected before the denunciation of the
ICSID Convention, thereby establishing its competence and the jurisdiction of the

Centre.

c. The Issue of Expropriation
i. Summary of the Parties’ Positions
1. The Applicant

349. The Applicant contends that in addition to not applying the Portugal BIT and
customary international law (and thus exceeding its powers when discussing the
element of payment),°"* the Tribunal also failed to state the reasons why it did not
apply the proper law. It develops its case in paragraphs 201-205 of its Memorial and
in paragraphs 158-206 of its Reply.*!*

350. In the initial proceeding, Venezuela had based its argument regarding the legality of
the expropriation on both Treaties and on customary international law. The Tribunal
reached its final conclusions by quoting both Treaties in the dispositive part of the
Award and in a summary, but based its reasons on the Luxembourg BIT only. As

such, the Applicant argues that:

“As a consequence, it is not possible to follow the Tribunal’s reasoning or
to understand what are the bases for concluding that Article IV of the
Venezuela-Portugal Treaty was breached and for not addressing the
Republic’s defence based on that Treaty as well as on customary rules of

international law.”3'5

351. The Applicant believes that the Tribunal’s decision may have been different had it

addressed the Portugal BIT and the rules of customary law.?!°

352. Further, the Applicant notes that the Tribunal did apply customary international law
when determining the quantum of compensation but failed to do the same when
determining the lawfulness of the expropriation. It argues that such approach is

“openly contradictory.”?!7

353. Finally, the Applicant asserts — relying on CMS v. Argentina — that these lacunae

cannot be filled and cured by the Parties or the Committee.*!*

2. The Respondents

354. The Respondents refute Venezuela’s argumentation in paragraphs 155-157 of its

Counter-Memorial and paragraphs 138-147 of its Rejoinder.*!”

355. They assert that the Tribunal had no reason to reconsider the Portugal BIT in its
section on the unlawfulness of the expropriation for lack of payment because it had
already found such unlawfulness in previous sections. Having found that the Portugal
BIT required a guarantee of cumulatively immediate, adequate and effective
payment, there was no need to address Venezuela’s allegation that it was enough to
provide a suitable mechanism since the obligations were “very clearly breached.”?”°
It was only the Luxembourg BIT that did not require immediate payment. Therefore,

the Tribunal correctly concentrated its reasoning on this BIT’s provision.*?!

356. Further, the Respondents submit that the Tribunal was under no obligation to examine

the rules of customary international law since such approach only reflects:

“the fact that customary international law applies in cases where treaty text
is silent (such as in determining the consequences of a violation of the
Treaties), but does not apply where treaty text explicitly deals with an issue
(such as the applicable criteria for determining the lawfulness of an
expropriation). Different bodies of law rightly apply in different
situations.”*

The Respondents argue that there is no contradiction between this approach and the
discussion of rules of customary law in the context of quantum since the Tribunal had
applied these rules along with the BITs and found that they would both lead to the

same result.>?3

In any event, the Respondents assert, the Tribunal was under no obligation to address
every single argument presented by the Parties as long as it addressed the questions

put before it. And that is what the Tribunal did.*”*

ii. The Committee’s Analysis and Determination

The Committee has already found that the Tribunal did not fail to apply the applicable
law when it based itself on the Luxembourg BIT in Section VI.4.3.C of the Award.

The Committee has come to this conclusion after examining carefully the totality of

Section VI of the Award, and not only its last subsection.

The Tribunal presented the relevant provisions of both BITs and marked the
difference. It then presented the difference between the processes of expropriation of
the investments in TAVSA and COMSIGUA. In paragraph 357 of the Award, the
Tribunal stated that “a delay of more than seven years in the payment of compensation
does not constitute “immediate” payment, following the wording of art. IV of the
Portugal Treaty.” It has gone on to develop specific arguments for the Luxembourg
BIT also in reference to Venezuela’s alternative argument that “the lack of payment

does not make the expropriation unlawful.”*?5

The Tribunal referred to paragraphs 298-304 of Venezuela’s Counter-Memorial in
the original proceeding, dated 24 October 2014, where Venezuela starts by quoting

the texts of both BITs, but bases its argument on Article 4 of the Luxembourg BIT

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 97 of 129

when referring to the provisions underlying the Amoco case, which are completely

different from the Portugal BIT.*7°

363. After having pondered the specificities of the Luxembourg BIT in the context of the
COMSIGUA expropriation, the Tribunal summarizes the result of Section VI of the
Award by determining that the “expropriation of the property belonging to Tavsa and

Comsigua occurred in breach of arts. IV and 4 of the Treaties.”*?”

364. The Committee had no difficulty to follow the totality of the Tribunal’s

argumentation resulting in this conclusion.

365. Further, it does not consider that the Tribunal reasoned contradictorily when it did not
base its decision on customary international law, even if it did mention customary law
in a different context. As explained in Section IV.B.2.d, the Treaties are the applicable
law. Where they foresee a provision with respect to a specific issue, there is no need

to examine customary law as well.

366. For these reasons, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not fail to state the

reasons for its decision to find the expropriation unlawful.

d. The Issue of the Valuation Date for the Determination of Damages
i. Summary of the Parties’ Positions
1. The Applicant

367. The Applicant asserts that the Tribunal contradicted itself clearly when it
characterized the expropriation of both TAVSA and COMSIGUA on the one hand,
and fixed the valuation date of the expropriation, on the other hand. In the Applicant’s
view “[t]his contradiction amounts to a failure to state reasons and warrants the

annulment of the Award.”*7

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 98 of 129

It submits*”° that the Tribunal had firstly defined “expropriation” under the BITs in
paragraph 317 of the Award as taking place “when the State adopts a measure, in the
exercise of any of its sovereign powers, which dispossesses the investor of its

investment.”>°°

The Applicant documents that on many different occasions the Tribunal had
confirmed that the dispossession had taken place after the adoption of Decree-Law
No. 6,058, or “Nationalization Decree”, dated 30 April 2008, and after President
Chavez’ announcement of 21 May 2009 on the nationalization of TAVSA and
COMSIGUA.**! With respect to TAVSA, it had found that the “takeover was
formalized via the so-called “Record of Transfer’ dated 16 November 2009”, while
“Tijn the case of Comsigua, the transfer of control over the Expropriated Assets was
carried out two years later, on 17 June 201 1.732 Likewise, the Tribunal
acknowledged that negotiations and meetings on compensation took place in 2009

and 2011, respectively.**?

In irreconcilable contradiction to its own reasoning, the Tribunal used “another,
artificial date of expropriation” for the purposes of its valuation date by relying on
the date of the Nationalization Decree, i.e. 30 April 2008. This decision increased the
amount of compensation tremendously, although, as previously held by the Tribunal,
“no expropriation measure existed yet.”**4 The Applicant insists that:

“[t]here is no place in the Award where a careful and informed reader can

find an explanation as to why the expropriation should be deemed to have

been configured before the date in which the questioned measure actually
had the effect of an expropriation.”**5

In fact, the Applicant alleges, the Nationalization Decree had no effect on the

investment and initiated only — in the Tribunal’s own appreciation — “a series of

posterior acts of the State [that] gave rise to an expropriation.”**° The Tribunal
assumed contradictorily an indirect expropriation for purposes of establishing liability
and a direct expropriation for the purposes of establishing the amount of

compensation.**”

The Applicant argues that “if the Tribunal considered—as it did—that an indirect
expropriation had taken place through the taking of control of the “Expropriated
Assets” by Venezuela, and that that taking of control had occurred in 2009 for Tavsa
and in 2011 for Comsigua, then it simply could not have found that the valuation date
should be April 30, 2008. Conversely, if the Tribunal considered that the
expropriation had occurred on April 30, 2008, then it could not have found that the
expropriation had consisted in the taking of control, especially when it found that
those takings occurred in 2009 (for Tavsa) and 2011 (for Comsigua). Those findings
are mutually exclusive, and amount to a complete failure to state grounds on the
critical issue of what expropriation, if any, took place, when it occurred, what it

consisted in, and what compensation, if any, should be awarded to Claimants.”**8

Finally, the Applicant alleges that the Tribunal “lied” when it justified the valuation
date for the expropriation of TAVSA by referring to the Applicant’s approval of such
date. The Applicant quotes its submission in the Counter-Memorial of 21 October
2014 and summarizes that it argued quite the contrary of an acceptance. Rather, it had
stated that “the Nationalization Decree could not have any expropriatory effects,”
which was first acknowledged by the Tribunal, only to be rejected without

justification for the fixing of the valuation date.*?

Venezuela’s position on that issue, and that those reasons are not in any way

contradictory.”*4°

375. They assert that the Tribunal based its analysis on Article 4 of the Luxembourg BIT,
and Article IV of the Portugal BIT, which both require appraising the value of the
investment concerned immediately prior to the adoption or publication of the

expropriatory measure.

376. They submit that the expropriation was a process which started with the
Nationalization Decree of 30 April 2008, continued by President Chavez’ public
announcement of 21 May 2009 confirming the nationalization of TAVSA and
COMSIGUA, was confirmed by Executory Decree No. 6,796 of 14 July 2009, and
finalized by the takeover of TAVSA in 2009 and COMSIGUA in 2011. The Parties
and their experts had proposed different dates to mark the first step in this process
and thereby the crucial moment for the valuation. Tenaris and Talta had found that
the date of the Nationalization Decree was appropriate, while Venezuela had argued
in favour of the President’s public announcement. The Tribunal weighed the Parties
arguments in paragraphs 405-417 of the Award and came to the reasoned conclusion
that Tenaris’ and Talta’s proposal corresponded better to the purpose of the
Treaties.**! With respect to an alleged contradiction, the Respondents submit that
both parties agreed that “in view of the Treaties the valuation date should be
immediately before the first relevant State measure”. While the Tribunal found that
the last relevant measure adopted by Venezuela was the formal taking of control of
TAVSA and COMSIGUA in 2009 and 2011 respectively, it found that the first
relevant State measure was the Nationalization Decree. There is no contradiction in

that reasoning.*4?

377. In sum, the Respondents argue that the Tribunal’s reasoning is straightforward,

consistent, and not contradictory. They summarize that:

“[o]ne may agree or disagree with the Tribunal’s conclusion on this point,
but there is no legitimate basis for arguing that these findings are so
contradictory that reasons are effectively absent.”

Finally, the Respondents address “one remaining, unfortunate matter”, namely
Venezuela’s allegation that the Tribunal lied when stating that Venezuela had
accepted TAVSA’s expropriation had occurred under the Nationalization Decree. To
this effect, the Respondents quote from Venezuela’s Counter-Memorial of 21 October
2014 and its Post-Hearing Brief of 2 October 2015, where Venezuela states, indeed,
that the occupation of TAVSA’s facilities “was authorized by Decree 6,058.”
Therefore, the “Tribunal accurately observed” and reproduced exactly Venezuela’s

statement.*“4

ii. The Committee’s Analysis and Determination

In order to understand fully the Tribunal’s reasoning, the Committee has to analyze
the totality of the Award, including the “factual background” as presented in its
Section VI.1. The relevant part starts with paragraph 253, where the Tribunal
described the Claimants’ account of “two takeovers within the framework of the
process aimed at the nationalization of the entire iron and steel sector of the Guyana
Province formalized through two Decrees: 6,058 (a.) and 6,796 (b.).”*° After
presenting the Decrees of 2008 and 2009 respectively, the Tribunal goes on to specify
the modalities of the takeover that has taken place in 2009 for TAVSA and 2011 for
COMSIGUA, “[iJn compliance with the Nationalization Decree and the Executory

Decree.”*4°

In the Committee’s mind, there is no doubt that the Tribunal understood the
expropriation not as a single act but as a process, as a series of events and measures
which started with the Nationalization Decree. That understanding is clearly
expressed in paragraph 320 of the Award, where the Tribunal defined the “measures”

of expropriation and nationalization, as stated in paragraphs 317 and 318, as

“legislative, judicial, or administrative acts adopted by a State, that significantly
interfere in the use and enjoyment of the investment, ending up in the annulment of
the value thereof, although without depriving the investor of its ownership and
control.” When paragraph 317 is read in the light of paragraph 320, it is clear that the
Tribunal did not contradict itself when finding that the Nationalization Decree was

the first administrative act that ‘ended up’ in the loss of value.

In the context of this issue, the Tribunal did not distinguish between a direct and an

indirect expropriation. The Committee does not find this approach erroneous.

Further, the Committee has the impression that Venezuela’s position is not without
ambiguity in this respect. It is true that in its Reply Memorial on Annulment and
during the Hearing, the Applicant argued that Decree 6,058 “could not have any
expropriatory effect.”*4” However, this allegation does not correspond to Venezuela’s
assertions made during the original proceeding before the Tribunal and which the
Tribunal quoted in paragraph 405 of its Award, namely paragraphs “284 et seq.” of
Venezuela’s Counter-Memorial, dated 21 October 2014. There, Venezuela confirms

that:

-  “Decree-Law No. 6,058 establishes that the transformation or transit of the iron
and steel industry from a private business concern to state production will take
place in various phases” (paragraph 286);

- “Executive Decree No. 6796 is precisely the law that contains such supplementary
provisions that will serve to specify the application of provisions in the
nationalization procedure applicable to the SIDOR affiliates, among them
TAVSA, which it expressly referenced. This Decree reproduces for TAVSA the
procedure outlined by Decree-Law No. 6,058” (paragraph 287);

- “in the case of CEMEX, in 2008 the Republic nationalized the cement industry
under Decree-Law No. 6091, which has a structure and content similar to Decree-

Law No. 6,058” (paragraph 295).

385.

The Committee cannot but understand these statements as affirming that Venezuela
considered the nationalization as a process and that the first measure in this process
was Decree-Law No. 6,058, similar to Decree-Law No. 6091, under which the cement
industry was nationalized. These assertions do not exclude that additional steps had
to follow to implement the process. Further, when reading the statements, the
Committee does not understand Venezuela’s allegation that the Tribunal lied when
stating that Venezuela accepted that TAVSA’s expropriation occurred under or by

virtue of Decree-Law No. 6,058.

The Committee is reinforced in its appreciation of Venezuela’s statements by the fact
that the Applicant did not opt for a valuation date corresponding to the date of the
takeovers but for the date of the day preceding President Chavez’ announcement of
21 May 2009, which was followed by Executive Decree No. 6,796, dated 14 July
2009. This Decree was certainly “a consequence of President Chavez’ statement of

21 May 200948, but it was at the same time ‘supplementary’ to Decree No. 6,058.

In light of these events and their appreciation by the Tribunal, the Committee does
not find any contradiction in its reasoning. It holds that the expropriation is a process,
consisting of a “measure”, which “shall be construed in the widest way possible” as
confirmed by the Treaties that add “the generic plural “measures.”*4? This measure
“dispossess the investor of its investment”, whereby the dispossession is not reducible
to a single act.**° It is true that the Tribunal “distinguishes between the instances of
this first Decree and the implementation of the decision by the Republic” **', but
holds at the same time that for purposes of establishing the date when the amount of
compensation is to be determined, the first measure influencing on the value of the
investment is determinative. The Tribunal found that already the Nationalization

Decree had “‘expropriatory effects’ and not only the Executory Decree as asserted

by Venezuela. The Tribunal fixed the valuation date accordingly. This line of

reasoning is detailed in paragraphs 403-417 of the Award, which in turn built on the

reasons given in its Section VI.

The Committee has no difficulty to follow the Tribunal’s reasoning and finds it
consistent and not contradictory. Therefore, it cannot annul the Award for lack of

reasons with respect to the valuation date.

At the same time, the Committee confirms that its findings on the Tribunal’s
reasoning with respect to the valuation date exclude the appropriateness of the
assertion that the Tribunal’s consequential calculations of damages and interests are

contradictory, as presented in the Applicant’s post hearing brief.***

The Issue of Price Projections in the Determination of Quantum
i. Summary of the Parties’ Positions
1. The Applicant

The Applicant asserts that the Tribunal contradicted itself when it decided on the
source for future price projections in its calculation of damages using the Discounted

Cash Flow (“DCF”) methodology.***

It submits that the Parties’ experts had proposed different approaches and formulas to
calculate price development probabilities. Venezuela’s expert had initially proposed
to choose as starting point historical prices adjusted by inflation. The Tribunal had
rejected the reference to historical prices in favor of a formula that TAVSA and
PDVSA had used in their negotiations on the amount of compensation after the
expropriation.*°> One of the elements of this formula is the publicly available Pipe
Logix index. The Tribunal disregarded this index without giving reasons for this
deviation, thus changing 70% of the calculation formula, although it was part of

exactly this formula that it had endorsed previously.**° This failure “is severe here

given that the Republic’s expert on quantum had expressly argued against

disregarding Pipe Logix.”**"

390. Ina further step, the Tribunal executed its decision to disregard the Pipe Logix index
by replacing it by an index published in Metal Bulletin Research, as proposed by
theRespondents, against the Applicant’s proposal to use the prices published by
Canaccord.*** Contrary to its initial decision to disregard historical prices, the

Tribunal chose Metal Bulletin Research because it “allegedly reflected better the

historical commercial trajectory of TAVSA regarding prices.”?°°

391. The Applicant concludes that:

“itis impossible for any reader of the Award to appreciate how the Tribunal
estimated future prices based on historical data, departing from the notion
that such future prices were not to be calculated from historical prices. As
explained above, the contradictions in the Tribunal’s reasoning amount to
having provided no reasoning at all, giving rise to the ground of annulment
of the Award contemplated in Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID
Convention.”*

2. The Respondents

392. The Respondents refute the Applicant’s request and assert that “[t]here is no merit at

all to this argument. It is based on a mischaracterization of the Tribunal’s

reasoning.”**!

393. They insist that:

“the Tribunal never declared that historical prices were irrelevant; just that
historical prices were not as reliable a projection of future prices as the price
formula that the parties had been negotiating. Venezuela’s ‘contradiction’
argument therefore fails at the threshold.”

394. Further, the Respondents submit that contrary to the Applicant’s allegation, the

Tribunal did give reasons to disregard the Pipe Logix index. The Tribunal considered

the index and found that it “makes price forecasts within a year, which is why it is not
valid for making price forecasts into the future.”*°? The Respondents argue that it is
irrelevant for the request for annulment that the Applicant disagrees with the
Tribunal’s reasons. The only point that matters is whether it gave reasons, and that is

what it did.*™

Finally, the Respondents contend that the Tribunal gave consistent reasons why it
preferred the Metal Bulletin over the Canaccord index. This had nothing “to do with
its relationship to historical prices, but because the Parties agreed, through their
conduct and the agreements they signed, that it was the preferable index to use when

projecting future prices.”>°

ii. The Committee’s Analysis and Determination

The Committee notes at the outset that it has neither the means nor the authority to
reassess the different expert opinions nor the appropriateness of one or the other index
for the estimation of future prices. Its role is limited to an examination of the Award

with respect to a possible failure to state reasons.

That said, the Committee has scrutinized paragraphs 536-555 of the Award and found
that the Tribunal provided detailed and non-contradictory reasons in its determination
of the estimation of prices of pipes, each time considering the different Parties’ expert

opinions.

The Tribunal confronted the experts’ proposals as to the manner on how to estimate
the prices. It preferred to rely on the approach that TAVSA and PDVSA had used
when negotiating the compensation in the real world. In paragraphs 538-540, the
Award explains why it considers this approach to be “the best indication of future
prices.” It is evident that it was not the preferred method because it rejects reliance
on historical prices, as the Applicant alleges, but because it was discussed in the

negotiations that have taken place between TAVSA and a partner with “wide

bargaining power” and because of a plausible assumption that the partners would
stick to the formula as agreed upon. There is no question of correct or incorrect expert

opinions but of a more or less appropriate method to arrive at plausible estimates.

Further, the Tribunal adapted the formula thus established by replacing one index
against another, Pipe Logic against Metal Bulletin Research. The Committee does not
venture into the relative qualities of the indices. Rather, it finds that the Tribunal
stated its reasons when formulating that “it is necessary to replace the international
reference to Pipe Logix with another index.”* The Tribunal argued that “Pipe Logix,
an index that samples global sales of seamless pipes, only makes price forecasts
within a year, which is why it is not valid for making price forecasts further into the
future.”*°’ These are reasons. The fact that they contradict Venezuela’s expert’s

proposal do not make them inconsistent.

Finally, the Tribunal made a choice between the Metal Bulletin Research and
Canaccord indices and opted for the Metal Bulletin Research. The Tribunal gave
reasons for this choice in paragraphs 544-555 of the Award. It referred to TAVSA’s
management forecasts and on commercial agreements, both of which relied on Metal
Bulletin and not on Canaccord, and concluded that “both the forecasts made by
Tavsa’s management and historical commercial agreements confirm the reliability of

the price estimates published by Metal Bulletin Research.”*°*

In addition, the Tribunal discussed Venezuela’s expert’s counter-argument in favor

of Canaccord and opined that:

“the answer shall be in favor of Metal Bulletin Research, as the foregoing
paragraphs have already shown that it is a reference publication in the
sector, while Cannacord Adams is an investment bank that publishes prices
of the iron and steel industry, as well as other industries [...]. Expert Hart
has failed to persuade the Arbitral Tribunal that, regardless of its predictive
reliability, Canaccord Adams was a price reference publication to
hypothetical buyers.”

The different quotations demonstrate that the Tribunal has not failed to give reasons

Applicant’s request to annul the Award for this reason.

The Issue of COMSIGUA’s Compensation
i. Summary of the Parties’ Positions
1. The Applicant

The Applicant contends that the Tribunal had “fully endorsed DCF as the applicable
methodology for the Valuation of COMSIGUA” “in its sufficiency” and as an
“exclusive DCF approach”, after having considered different other valuation methods
and having found them “not consistently reliable.”*”? After having calculated the
amount of compensation based on its chosen methodology, the Tribunal contrasted
the result with the other methods of valuation that it had rejected before and found
that the amount arrived at through the DCF method was too low and that therefore, it

should be augmented.

The Applicant alleges that “the Tribunal states no reason for its decision to increase
the amount of compensation once the DCF calculation was completed” and that it has
made it “impossible for any impartial and informed reader to understand this move

from a DCF calculation to a factoring of other previously dismissed methods.”*7!

It argues that the comparison of the amount arrived at by the DCF method “with
results yielded by other methodologies is in itself problematic, since there is no
apparent reason to check an allegedly reliable methodology against other unreliable

or less reliable methodologies.”*””

Further, it alleges that “shockingly” the Tribunal in weighting the different

calculation methods found the compensation paid to Japanese investors an indicator

more reliable than other comparators despite the fact that such compensation was

lower than the value arrived at through the DFC method.3”3

407. Further, the Applicant points to an even more “fantastic contradiction” resulting from
the irreconcilable difference in valuation of TAVSA and COMSIGUA. It submits that
for both investments the Tribunal has applied the DCF methods first, has contrasted
the amounts yielded to other methods because they were “on the low end for both
companies”, and has finally decided to leave the TAVSA amount untouched while
increasing the one for COMSIGUA. The Tribunal has failed completely to state the

reasons why it treated identical situations differently.*”4

408. Finally, the Applicant suggests that the erroneous determination of the valuation date
has immediate repercussions on the reasoning in the context of the appraisal of
damages since the “Award does not allow a reader to calculate the damages to be

awarded if the valuation date was not April 30, 2008.”37°

The Respondents

409. The Respondents submit that the Applicant mischaracterizes the Tribunal’s

reasoning.

410. They insist that that the Tribunal did not choose the DCF method to the exclusion of
other methods.*”° They refer to the beginning of the Section on the determination of
the appropriate method in the Award, where the Tribunal holds:

“The Arbitral Tribunal finds no reason to depart from the traditional DCF
method (1.), which has become a standard in company valuation: in the

instant case, the company had a past history and there was a predictability
of future cash flows that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy.

This being said, nothing prevents the Arbitral Tribunal from contrasting the
value obtained with other approaches (2.).”3”7

Thus, the Tribunal did not only endorse the DCF method exclusively from the outset
but announced that it would possibly correct the results in contrasting them to other

methods. The Tribunal gave consistent reasons for its approach.

Further, it is not true, the Respondents assert, that the Tribunal did not give reasons
why it found the other methodologies worth considering. In fact, it gave a detailed

analysis in paragraphs 705-749.278

Equally and contrary to the Applicant’s allegations, the Tribunal stated the reasons in

paragraph 752 of the Award on why and how it weighted the different comparators.*”

Finally, the Respondents argue that “the evaluation of damages is not an exact
science, and tribunals are given wide scope to exercise their own judgment in
determining the damages owed.”**? They refer to jurisprudence going back as far as
the Chorzéw Factory judgment, where the Permanent Court of International Justice
held that courts and tribunals have the power:

“to ascertain the value to be estimated by several methods, in order to

permit of a comparison and if necessary of completing the results of the one
by those of the others.”**!

In that context, the Respondents recall that the Venezuelan government had
recommended a price of 24 million USD for the purchase of Talta’s shares in
COMSIGUA, which is not far from the 24.7 million USD ascertained by the

Tribunal.**?
The Respondents summarize their argument by stating:

“One may disagree with the conclusion that the valuation produced by the
DCF method resulted in a value that was in the “low range.” One may
disagree with the Tribunal’s decision to use multiple valuation methods in
addition to the DCF method. One may disagree with the Tribunal’s
implementation and weighting of those alternative valuation methods. And
one may disagree with the Tribunal’s use of the word “contrast” to describe

what it was doing when it applied these other valuation methods. But that
is all irrelevant at the annulment stage: whether the Tribunal erred is not a
basis for annulment. The only relevant question is whether the Tribunal
stated its reasons — whether the reader can follow the Tribunal’s reasoning
from A to B. It cannot seriously be suggested that the Tribunal’s Award
fails that basic test.”**

ii. The Committee’s Analysis and Determination

In Section IV.B.2.c, the Committee has presented its reasons and determined why it
believes that the Tribunal did not depart from a fundamental rule of procedure when
it increased the amount of compensation for the expropriation of COMSIGUA after
a comparison between the value resulting from calculations performed under the DCF
method and other approaches and methods. These “other approaches” (to use a term
introduced by the Tribunal as a headline of subsection VII.3.2) were not of the
Tribunal’s making but introduced by the two Parties and analyzed extensively by the

Tribunal.**

The Committee has come to its conclusion by following the Tribunal’s reasoning.
The reasons are unfolded in Section VII of the Award, in paragraphs 387 to 402 and
630 to 755.

In a first step, the Tribunal referred to Articles 4 of the Luxembourg Treaty and IV of
the Portugal Treaty and defined its duty as to determine the “market value” or “real
value” of the expropriated property, calculated on the day preceding the valuation

date. It stated that the Parties agree that both expressions of value are equivalent.**>

In a second step, the Tribunal determined the market value for TAVSA and for
COMSIGUA in Subsections VII.2 and VII.3, respectively. Each time, the Tribunal
started by presenting the Parties’ positions. They do not object to the DCF method

but offer at the same time alternative methods of valuation.

For TAVSA, the Tribunal’s DCF analysis leads to an amount of the “market value”

of 112,345,530 USD, as summarized in paragraphs 603-604 of the Award. In

paragraphs 605 to 628, the Tribunal contrasted this result to three other approaches,
the return on investment, the market multiples and comparable transactions, each time
relying on the figures presented by one or the other expert. If found that the
comparison led to a result according to which the estimated market value arrived at
through the application of the DCF method is “reasonable.”**° Therefore, it confirmed

the result.>87

The Applicant does not assert that the Award lacks reasons with respect to TAVSA’s

valuation, contrarily to the valuation of COMSIGUA.

Like for TAVSA, the Tribunal displayed the Parties’ methods of valuation of
COMSIGUA. It started by pointing out Claimants’ experts’ opinion in paragraphs
632-663 who “have calculated Comsigua’s value based on the discounted cash flow
(1.); but they have also determined it based on market multiples (2.). And, finally,
they have given their opinion regarding Comsigua’s value implied in other

transactions (3.).” +88

In paragraphs 664-683 of the Award, the Tribunal presented Venezuela’s expert
opinion who “does not oppose to the use of the DCF (1.) or the market ratios (2.) as
methods for the calculation of Comsigua’s value, but he does question certain
hypotheses or parameters used by the counterpart’s experts. And, even then, he
prefers other forms to calculate the value (3.); specifically, the expert analyzes the
transaction with the Japanese Shareholders and the purchase price recommendation
made by Comsigua’s management, but he has also found other measures of

Comsigua’s value.”**

The Committee quotes these initial summaries of the Parties’ experts, which are

followed by a detailed analysis of each of their proposed methods and calculations.

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 113 of 129

The quotes demonstrate that the experts did not advocate the use of one method to the

exclusion of another.

425. The Tribunal accepted this approach in the reasoned belief that it facilitates a
calculation that gets as close as possible to the determination of the real market value.
The Committee has examined carefully the Award and has not found any indication
that the Tribunal considered the results provided by the DCF method determinative
or conclusive, to the exclusion of the other methods, which in any event were

suggested by the Parties’ experts.

426. On the contrary: the Tribunal started the subsection on its determination of
COMSIGUA’s value by announcing that it would choose “as its preliminary decision
the value method determination.” It then opted for the DCF method which none of
the experts were opposed to, and which has become the traditional method of valuing
enterprises. However, the Tribunal continued to emphasize its discretion to use
elements of other methods. The Tribunal reiterated its approach and reasoning in
paragraph 705 of the Award as follows:

“[the Tribunal] has decided to determine Comsigua’s value by applying the
DCF methodology. But this does not mean that other approaches should not
be used to contrast the value obtained. The Tribunal shall analyze these
approaches infra.” °°

427. After having explained what it intended to do, it unfolded in a third step its own
appreciation of the ‘other approaches’ in paragraphs 706-749. Consistent with its
stated duty to establish the “market value”*?!, the Tribunal tested the result arrived at
through the DFC method with “market” multiples. With the use of these market
multiples, the Tribunal found in paragraphs 712-713:

“.., that Comsigua is the last in the line, although close to the benchmark
companies. The Arbitral Tribunal would have expected its value to be more

centered, as it would have been the case with a multiplier of 1.25x of the
BVA and of 2x of the BVE.

Applying a multiplier of 1.25x of the BVA and of 2x of the BVE,
it results in a value of Talta’s stake in Comsigua of USD 24.06
million and USD 26.08 million.”

Thus, the Tribunal expressed some misgiving with respect to the value of

COMSIGUA resulting from the DFC method in the light of other market benchmarks.

The Tribunal then proceeded to evaluate some “Comparable Transactions” in
paragraphs 714-.749. As a result, it came to the conclusion that it had identified
“different indicative calculations of Comsigua’s value, with greater or lesser degree
of reliability.”*°? It compared the result of these calculations and found firstly that the
DCF methods yielded a result that “is in the low range, and therefore, it should be
raised”, and secondly that the different calculations with their different degree of
reliability should be weighted. In assigning the respective weights, the Tribunal noted
that it had “accept[ed] the criticism that [the compensation paid to the Japanese

shareholders] is no indication of a fair market value, but a forced sale price..”>*

In paragraph 752 of the Award, the Tribunal concluded that the market value of the
Respondents’ shareholding in COMSIGUA amounted to USD 24,672,357.

The Committee finds that the Tribunal stated reasons why it had some doubts that the
value arrived at through the DCF method reflected the “market” or “real” value of
COMSIGUA. From the findings in the Award, the Committee understands the fact

that the Tribunal considered it appropriate to rely also on other valuation means.

The Committee has neither the information nor the authority to reassess the weighting
exercise nor the experts’ figures and parameters and the Tribunal’s calculations.
However, it is able to state with certainty that the Tribunal stated the reasons why it
exercises its uncontestable discretion to evaluate the damage and to calculate the

compensation, and that these reasons are not contradictory.

The Committee further recognizes that the Tribunal has applied identical methods in

assessing TAVSA’s and COMSIGUA’s values. Based on the experts’ figures, it has

come to different results. In TAVSA’s case, it found that the amount arrived at
through the application of the DCF method was reliable to represent the market value.
In COMSIGUA’s case, the Tribunal found that the results arrived at through the DCF
method were not reasonable when contrasted to the results in the comparative
methods. These are different results for different circumstances and figures. The
Committee does not see any contradiction, whereby the arguments used in the

TAVSA context neutralize the ones used in the COMSIGUA context.

434. Therefore, the request to annul the Award for lack of reasons in the context of the

determination of COMSIGUA’s damage valuation must fail.

g. The Issue of the Tax Indemnity
i. Summary of the Parties’ Positions
1. The Applicant

435. The Applicant asserts that the Tribunal based its decision on the tax exemption for
the compensation on Article 5 of the Venezuela-Luxembourg BIT. The provision was
its “normative support.”?**

436. However, the Tribunal did not give reasons for its application and interpreted it in a

way that is “logically flawed.”*? The Applicant argues and requests:

“The absence of reasons (or, equally, providing arbitrary or inconsistent
reasons, which amount to no reasons at all) does not allow an informed
reader to understand how the Tribunal moved from the premises to its
conclusion regarding tax indemnities. Therefore, this portion of the Award
is also annullable by virtue of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.”*°

437. The Applicant alleges that the Tribunal did not state reasons why it restricted the
imposition of taxes to the deliverance of “authorizations” instead of interpreting the

norm in a “literal, harmonious” way referring to indemnification.*?”

The Tribunal’s interpretation of Article 5 of the Luxembourg BIT via reference to its
preamble, which specifies as its purpose the attraction of investments and the creation
of favorable economic conditions, and its effort to justify its erroneous interpretation
by a reference to VCLT Article 31, contains a non sequitur fallacy. The Tribunal
“jumps from a very general assertion contained in the Preamble of the BIT concerning
the creation of favorable conditions for investment to the legal conclusion that those
general assertions support the interpretation that taxes—otherwise explicitly
safeguarded in Article 5 of the BIT—cannot be applied to the amounts of

compensation awarded to an alleged foreign investor.”*°*

Further, the Applicant criticizes the Tribunal for quoting Article 4(c) of the
Luxembourg BIT and Article IV(c) of the Portugal BIT first and to “jump
immediately thereafter to a conclusion regarding the imposition of taxes on
compensation that is not linked in any way to the articles of the Treaty that it cites.”?°
“In this way, the Tribunal contradicts itself by establishing as a premise of its
reasoning a pair of legal rules but extracting a conclusion that is not derived from

those premises but from some different, unrevealed source,””40°

2. The Respondents

The Respondents contend firstly that Convention Article 52(1)(e) is not applicable
because the Tribunal did not base its decision on the tax indemnity on Article 5 of the
Luxembourg Treaty but on Articles 4 of the Luxembourg and Portugal Treaties, and
stated the reasons for a compensation free of taxes in Section IX.2 of the Award. The
issue of Article 5 is therefore not result-determinative and cannot justify the

annulment.4°!

Secondly, the Respondents assert that in and of itself the Tribunal’s discussion of
Article 5 of the Luxembourg BIT is clear, comprehensive and can be followed. In

light of the contradictory French, Spanish and Dutch texts of the BIT, the Tribunal

applied the French version. It interpreted the text as providing that such fees do not
refer to the free transfer of compensation but to the issuance of authorizations, an
interpretation that is supported by the use of the French term ‘taxes’, which the

Tribunal rightly considered to be a levy of services provided by the State.*°”

Moreover, the Respondents assert that the Applicant mischaracterizes the Tribunal’s
reasoning when referring to the preamble of the BIT. When doing so, the Tribunal
does not rely on an ‘unrevealed source’ but on VCLT Article 31, as explicitly quoted
in paragraph 818 of the Award.*®? Further, the Tribunal referred to the preamble to
support its literal interpretation of the term “fees” in Article 5 of the Luxembourg

BIT.

Finally, the Applicant’s argument reveals that it complains about the sufficiency and
the content of reasons and not about their absence. Such type of complaint is

misplaced in annulment proceedings.*”*

ii. The Committee’s Analysis and Determination

The Committee notes that the Tribunal declared at the beginning of the section on
taxation (Section IX) that it “shall explain the position of the parties (1.) and make a
decision (2.), thereafter, it shall analyze a specific question: the possible impact of

art. 5 of the Luxembourg Treaty (3.).’4°°

This declaration is straightforward: The Tribunal will decide the taxation issue, and
once it has done so, it will examine whether Article 5 of the Luxembourg BIT

supports this decision or whether it warrants a correction.

In paragraphs 782-792 of the Award, the Tribunal reasons and concludes, after having
presented the Parties’ arguments in paragraphs 777-781, that “the compensation

ordered by the Award shall be net of Venezuelan taxes.”4°°

The Committee finds the Tribunal’s reasoning and conclusions to be detailed and
consistent. It does not share the Applicant’s allegation that they are “self-serving,

layman general notions.”47

In Subsection IX.3 of the Award, the Tribunal checked its decision on the tax

exemption against Article 5 of the Luxembourg BIT.

It started by presenting the controversial position of the Parties and then weighed
possible contradictory interpretations of Article 5.3.4°° The Tribunal noted a
difference in the French, Dutch and Spanish texts. It reasoned that preference should
be given to the French text, since Article 12 of the Treaty provides that “while the
Spanish, French and Dutch texts are equally authentic, in the event of disagreement,
the fact that the negotiations were carried out in French shall be taken into

account.“

Asa next step, the Tribunal interpreted the French text in light of VCLT Article 31.4!°
The Committee does not understand the Applicant’s allegation that the Tribunal relied

on “a pair of rules” and — unrelatedly — on “some different unrevealed source.”*!!

In accordance with VCLT Article 31, the Tribunal determined the ordinary meaning
of Article 5.3 of the Luxembourg BIT in paragraphs 819-824 of the Award and

concluded that:

“The literal interpretation of the terms used supports the interpretation
advanced by Claimants: “Esto” (“ce”) [“this”, omitted in the English
translation] may only refer to the obligation assumed by the State under
Article 5.3, that is, to issue the authorization, but not to the transfers.”"!?

“This literal interpretation is reinforced by the use of the term “tasas”
(“taxes”). There are different types of tax burdens, such as fees.*"* A fee is

413 The Venezuelan law makes a difference between fees and other fiscal charges, such as taxes. See Articles 31
and 136 of the 1961 Venezuelan Constitution and Article 13 of the 1994 Venezuelan Organic Tax Code, as
effective upon negotiation of the Treaty.

a charge that the taxpayer pays for a service provided by the State. This is
the usual meaning of the term ‘fee’. The fees mentioned under Article 5.3
may only apply to one taxable fact: the issuance by the Authorities of all
necessary administrative authorizations to transfer an investment or the
returns thereof abroad. The issuance of an authorization is a public utility,
whereas the existence of a transfer could not be taxed, as a transfer is not
per se a public utility provided by the State.’4!*

Further, the Tribunal determined that the literal interpretation was supported by the
‘context, object and purpose’ found in the preamble of both Treaties. It held that an
interpretation that does not impose tax burdens upon the transfer of compensation is

more in line with the purpose of the Treaties. *!°

Finally, the Tribunal added an argument to its interpretation that it distills from the
Venezuelan Nationalization Decree as it was applied to the Japanese investors.
Article 10 of the Decree exempts the compensation from taxes. The Tribunal held
that “the tax exemption expressly recognized under the Nationalization Decree and
granted to the Japanese Shareholders is relevant, because it evidences a State behavior
consistent with the Arbitral Tribunal’s interpretation of Article 5.3 of the Treaty,

provided herein.”4!°

As a general result, the Tribunal found that Article 5.3 of the Luxembourg BIT did
not impact its decision arrived at by applying Article 4 and IV of the BITs, namely

that the compensation must be paid net of taxes.

The Committee finds the summary of the Tribunal’s reasoning to be comprehensive,
mutually reinforcing and free of contradiction. Therefore, the Committee rejects the
Applicant’s request for a partial annulment of the Award for lack of reasons for the

Tribunal’s decision to ascertain the compensation net of taxes.

h. The Issue of the Apportionment of Costs

456.

457.

458.

459.

i. Summary of the Parties’ Positions
1. The Applicant

The Applicant asserts that the Tribunal’s allocation of costs “contains a number of

serious defects that warrant annulment of the Award.”4!7

It argues that firstly, the Tribunal’s approach is “completely subjective” and devoid
of any citation of “jurisprudence or principles.”*!® Secondly, even if tribunals have a
certain discretion to apportion costs, they are held to state the reasons for their
decision and “should not be allowed to get away with a serious argumentative

defect.”*"

The Applicant submits that the Tribunal had decided to adopt the ‘cost follow the
event’ approach. Accordingly, the Tribunal stated that it would take the “degree of
success” into account. However, when it had to apply its own standard, the Tribunal
failed to take into account that Venezuela had prevailed in the dispute with respect to
the appropriate interest rate. The Tribunal had accepted a one-year LIBOR plus 4%
rate, in line with Venezuela’s expert opinion, instead of the WACC as proposed by
Tenaris and Talta. This decision significantly reduced the amount of damages to be

paid.

Thus, the Tribunal contradicted the approach it had previously adopted. It did not
consider Venezuela’s relative success in regards to the interest rate into its overall
degree of success, thereby artificially decreasing its rate and increasing its costs. “This
contradiction resulted in a meaningful amount of the compensation awarded to
Tenaris and Talta which was awarded under terms that warrant annulment of the

Award.”42°

2. The Respondents

The Respondents submit that “Venezuela’s argument amounts to nothing more than
a disagreement with the Tribunal’s application of the “costs follow the event”
principle.”4?!

They argue that the Tribunal stated the reasons why it adopted the “costs follow the
event” principle and then stated the reasons how it apportioned the costs according to
this principle with respect to the relative success of each Party for the issues of
jurisdiction, liability and quantum. When Venezuela criticizes the Tribunal for not
taking a sub-issue into account for the apportionment of costs, it does not explain why
the latter was obliged to do so. In addition, Venezuela fails to explain why the
Tribunal’s approach “prevents the reader from following the Tribunal’s reasoning

from A to B.” 4?

Finally, Venezuela has failed to explain that the alleged contradiction in the
Tribunal’s reasoning was “so severe that the two conflicting reasons “cancel each

other out so as to amount to no reasons at all.””473

ii. The Committee’s Analysis and Determination

The Committee notes that the Tribunal correctly concluded, based on Convention
Article 61(2), that “it has discretion to award costs.”4*4 The Tribunal then explained
how it exercised its discretion and why it did so, each time after having presented the

Parties’ positions and claims.*”°

The reasons are detailed. They state why the Tribunal rejected Venezuela’s assertion
that the Claimants acted in bad faith which should be reflected in the apportionment
of the costs (paragraphs 840-842), why the Tribunal accepted the Claimants’ proposal
to apply the widely used principle “costs follow the event” (paragraphs 843-844), and

470.

how this principle is applied to the facts and the results of the case (paragraphs 845-

846). This is far from being “completely subjective.”

The Tribunal determined, in application of the “costs follow the event” principle, that
“Claimants are the successful party, as they have seen how the jurisdictional
objections were rejected and their principal claim accepted by the Arbitral Tribunal.
However, Respondent has also succeeded to some extent, as it has persuaded the

Arbitral Tribunal that the applicable compensation was lesser than that claimed.”47°

Having found so, the Tribunal did not apply the principle exclusively and as a
mathematical exercise, but took other elements into account, some of which favor the
Claimants and some the Respondent. That approach is covered by the Tribunal’s wide

discretion. Thus, it is not subject to a correction by the Committee.

From this perspective, the Tribunal started by ordering Venezuela to pay the totality
of the costs of proceedings irrespective of the “cost follow the event” principle. The
reasons are not linked to the relative success of either Party but to Venezuela’s
decision not to participate in advancing its part of these costs and to the Tribunal’s

rejection of Venezuela’s objections to jurisdiction.*?”

As a next step, the Tribunal decided to reduce the amount of defense expenses
claimed by Tenaris and Talta from 6 million USD to 2.8 million USD, again not by
applying the “cost follow the event” principle but by holding that 2.8 million USD

are reasonable.

When weighing the reasonable defense expenses, the Tribunal considered the
complexity of each issue (jurisdiction, liability and quantum), the “assistance

provided by counsel,” and the level of success in each issue.*”8

The Tribunal applied these criteria to allocate the reasonable defense expenses. It

“Ttook] into consideration the complexity of each of the great issues under discussion

473.

and Claimants’ level of success.“ In its determination of the level of success with
respect to quantum, the Tribunal exercised its discretion and took only the principal
amounts of compensation into account, as requested by the Claimants and partly

ascertained by Venezuela.

The Tribunal did not take the ancillary claims into account, such as the final allocation
of costs nor the decision on the interest rate. As to the allocation of costs, it ascertained
the Claimants’ claim for full cost recovery only partly. As to interest, the Tribunal
applied a one-year LIBOR plus 4% rate. The Tribunal came to this decision by
hearing the Parties’ experts on this point and then exercising its discretion. The
decision was more in line with Venezuela’s expert’s opinion although not entirely,

since he had proposed a six-month LIBOR plus 2% rate.*°

The Applicant opines that this is “a serious argumentative defect” and an “internal
contradiction,” and not, as alleged by the Respondents, at best an error in the
Tribunal’s reasoning, which would not give rise to annulment. It argues that any
contradiction “can be re-described as an error, since contradiction is indeed a form of
error.” Allowing such “artificial re-description” would lead to the result that
“contradiction would cease to be an instance of no statement of reasons under Article
52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, a notion that runs afoul with a unanimous line of

persuasive decisions to the contrary.”4*!

The Committee disagrees with the Applicant’s reasoning. Convention
Article 52(1)(e) does not use the term ‘contradiction’ but allows the annulment of an
award if it fails to state the reasons on which it is based. Instances may exist when
two reasons in an award neutralize each other with the practical effect of an absence
of reasons. The issue is not one of the lexical meaning of the term ‘contradiction’ and
its vicinity to the term ‘error’. Rather, the issue is one of an absence of reasons caused

by the mutual annihilation of irreconcilable reasons.

474. The Committee finds that the Tribunal explained in detail the criteria that led it to

exercise its discretion the way it did. While the ‘costs follow the event’ principle was

the Jeitmotif, it differentiated and used additional considerations, without contenting

itself to a strictly mathematical exercise. When weighing the relative success of both

Parties with respect to quantum, the Tribunal exercised its discretion to take only the

principal claim for compensation into account and not the ancillary claims for the

payment of interest and of costs as well. In addition, the Tribunal used its discretion

to establish the interest rate and had not followed the Parties’ experts fully. In both

cases, the Tribunal exercised its discretion. It is not for the Committee to correct this.

475. In any event, even assuming that the Tribunal inadvertently omitted to take into

consideration the saving due to the application of an interest rate lower than the one

requested by the Claimants, such omission would not have annihilated another reason.

At best, it would be an error that does not amount to a failure to state reasons.

476. For these reasons, the Committee has not found that the Tribunal failed to state the

reasons on which it has based its decision on the apportionment of costs to warrant

annulment.

485.

488.

489.

According to Convention Article 61(2) and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j), which are
applicable mutatis mutandis to annulment proceedings (see Article 52(4)
Convention)), the Committee has discretion to determine “how and by whom” the

costs and expenses of ICSID, the Committee and the Parties are borne.

In accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), the
Applicant was “solely responsible for making the advance payments [...] without
prejudice to the right of the Committee in accordance with Article 52(4) of the
Convention to decide how and by whom expenses incurred in connection with the
annulment proceeding shall be paid.” The Applicant has paid the advances as

requested, amounting to USD 546,565.45.

The Committee finds it appropriate to follow mutatis mutandis the same approach as
the Tribunal. It takes into account the principle that costs should normally follow the

event, as well as other circumstances specific to annulment proceedings.

With respect to the costs of the proceeding, the Committee is conscious of the fact
that in annulment proceedings, conversely to original arbitration proceedings, the
applicant has to pay the necessary advances. In case of the rejection of its application,
the ‘cost follow the event’ principle leads to a result that corresponds to another
principle of cost allocation according to which ‘costs should lie where they fall.’ Both
principles have their merits and reinforce each other with respect to the costs of the
proceeding due to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e). In
application of both standards, the Committee decides that the Applicant shall bear the

cost of the proceeding given that its Application was rejected.

With respect to the Parties’ legal fees and expenses, the matter is more complicated,

also because the two principles lead to different results.

The Committee believes that the remedy of annulment is important to guarantee the

legitimacy and acceptability of the ICSID system. There is an objective interest to

120

Case 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 9-1 Filed 04/01/19 Page 128 of 129

assure that awards do not suffer from fundamental defects. In the present case, the

Committee has found that the Award was free of such flaws.

490. Both Parties have greatly assisted the Committee to reach its conclusions through
their diligent and efficient written and oral submissions and presentations. For this
reason, the Committee agrees with the ad hoc committee in Tenaris J. It has found in
similar circumstances that “the underlying fundamental questions posed by them [the
grounds for annulment] justify that each Party shall bear all expenses incurred in
connection with its own defence.”’“*! In line with this argument, the Committee finds
it reasonable to extend the application of the principle that costs should lie where they
fall to all costs of the present case, and decides that each Party shall bear its own legal

costs and expenses.
VI. DECISION
491. For the foregoing reasons, the Committee decides unanimously:

(1) The Application for Annulment of the Award is rejected;
(2) Each Party shall bear its own costs and fees; and

(3) The Applicant shall bear the costs of the annulment proceeding, including

the fees and expenses of the Committee and the costs of the Centre.
